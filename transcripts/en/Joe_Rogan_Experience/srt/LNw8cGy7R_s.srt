1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:03,583
Yeah.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,760
Beautiful.
Beautiful.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,140
Uh,

4
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:18,510
we got snow flakes up in
this motherfucker. Jamie.

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,570
We are live, we are live, have naf.

6
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:32,470
Years ago today snowflakes were in the
house so we figured Brian and I were

7
00:00:32,471 --> 00:00:35,980
talking the other day and I was thinking
that like one of the things that we

8
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:38,860
always, like we always said,
oh we didn't talk about this.

9
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:40,210
Oh we didn't talk about that.

10
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:45,130
He's always episodes where whatever
subject we get into with the guest,

11
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,630
like it doesn't, we don't, sometimes we
miss like crazy fucking stories that we,

12
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:51,190
if we had more time we'd talked about,

13
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,550
so we decided to do a show just dedicated
only to crazy shit that we see online

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,290
with no guests. Old School,
old school, snowflake style.

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,710
Sometimes you get away from
what got you to the dance

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:06,620
and there was like a thing
that happened like that.

17
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,030
We didn't talk about the Paris Hilton
video where he, she was on a plane.

18
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,470
It's like if we just brought that up,

19
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:15,230
cause I knew I had this whole theory
where that was not real. You know,

20
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:17,620
like why was her face not blurred?

21
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:22,420
And Brian is the best person I know about
calling bullshit about videos online.

22
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:25,600
Hands down. No one comes close. You've,

23
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:30,630
you've nailed so many fucking people that
are bullshitting online to hilarious.

24
00:01:30,761 --> 00:01:32,470
Like everybody buys into it.
Me included.

25
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,720
I buy into a lot of them
and then you're like,

26
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:37,480
I think it's bullshit in my car man.
You're always fucking skeptical.

27
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,220
It turns out to be bullshit.

28
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,970
It sucks to be me though because I see
it on Facebook and I see a post like

29
00:01:42,971 --> 00:01:46,930
things posted for years like and a half
to go to each one like fig and hey,

30
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:52,330
did you see the one recently where
the guy, a cat runs out into traffic.

31
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,680
So the guy runs after the cat
and does flips over cars now,

32
00:01:56,681 --> 00:02:00,880
but I'm sure that it's so
fake. If you seen a jammy no.
Oh see if you can find it.

33
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:02,200
Cause it's preposterous.

34
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,700
The people were actually believing the
guy jumps over a speeding car in the

35
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:11,860
highway and then does a
flip over another car.

36
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,020
But it doesn't even look
like he misses the car.

37
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:15,970
It's like really shitty the way it's done.

38
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,170
Cause like that's he fucked up with
the flip. Like if he just did the jump,

39
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:24,190
maybe people would have believed it
because the jump luck looks almost real.

40
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,070
That he actually might've jumped
over the roof of a fucking car.

41
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,870
Does any of these thumbnails, uh, well
if I can do this, maybe it was it work?

42
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,990
Any of these thumbnails? Nope.
Nope. Nope. No, no, no, no,

43
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,620
no, no. I okay. It usually
gets run over by a car. No,

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,800
just a lot of horrible videos we put
[inaudible] it's a dude jumps over car.

45
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,560
How about Jude jumps over car to save
cat cat over car to that whole cat.

46
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,190
Kitty car Joe. Yeah, that's right. The
Lawful Kitty cat card jump. That's it.

47
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,300
Top One.
Watch this guy now watch this shit.

48
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,530
Come on.

49
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:10,530
[inaudible]

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,940
dangerous look both ways.
Probably cross the street. Yeah.

51
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,420
This is the straight youtube video.

52
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,950
I know exactly how they did.
[inaudible] I can recreate that

53
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,560
dangerous look both ways
before you cross the street.

54
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:37,520
This is amazing that something like that,
which would allow for that.

55
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:42,170
Something that would have been like an
insane movie special effect just 20 years

56
00:03:42,171 --> 00:03:46,130
ago now you could do it on your laptop
and that's not even what you do.

57
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,490
You can just, it's not like,
it's not like you know you're,

58
00:03:49,491 --> 00:03:52,040
you're a special effects guy. Yeah. Crazy.

59
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:55,340
The technology that's available to the
average person today is just off the

60
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:56,210
charts crazy.

61
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:59,900
One of my first special effects I
learned how to do is recording something.

62
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:04,010
You could just record yourself sitting
down like at a table and then you could

63
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:04,761
just sit there and be like,

64
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:08,540
act like you're talking to somebody to
the right of you and then you get up and

65
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:12,260
then you just sit on the other side of
the table and go, oh thank you very much.

66
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,100
Awe.

67
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:16,170
And they just split in the middle and
then put the two together and it's about

68
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,000
this being that there's like a
moving camera. Well with this,

69
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:22,160
what they probably do at this,
they probably had two cameras,

70
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:23,660
probably Gopros or something like that,

71
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:28,130
sitting right next to each other and
they recorded it at the same time.

72
00:04:28,131 --> 00:04:30,360
But also they put them on like
a rack or something maybe.

73
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,700
So they're both on the same plane or what
they probably did is they filmed it as

74
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:38,240
if a while the cars were going,

75
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:41,960
the cars were just driving by and then
they kind of like put him into it using,

76
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,200
uh Oh, I see. Okay. So they film it.

77
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:48,020
The cars are driving by and
then when there's no cars,

78
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,150
then he runs out and jumps. The
camera never moves. Yeah. Yeah.

79
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,120
So the camera does move while
he's running. Shake, shake,

80
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,150
camera shake. Yeah, we can add that.
Yeah. That's so weird. It's, it's,

81
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,510
I mean,
I'm not doubting it at all,

82
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,790
but I'm just saying it's so weird
that you could do it so well.

83
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,940
The only thing that really fucks
it up is when he does the flip,

84
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,700
because the flip is just, you're
retarded. Yeah. That's just ridiculous.

85
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,080
You're just peeing in my face.
You know? It's just like before.

86
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:17,030
Then when he jumps over the car,

87
00:05:17,031 --> 00:05:20,450
if he just did that and grabbed the cat
and then was like holy shit and then

88
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:24,110
stayed in the medium for a second,
you might almost believe that he did that.

89
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,210
Why wouldn't they just have it be
something so amazing and simple instead of

90
00:05:29,211 --> 00:05:32,000
like, cause everyone's going to see
that go. That's fake as fuck. You know?

91
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:36,140
Not everyone, man. There's, there's some
fucking people out there. Yeah, true.

92
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,920
The guy jumping over the Lamborghini a
couple of years ago and then Kobe Bryant

93
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:44,000
did it and then everybody recreated it.
Oh Coby Brian. But he'd do it for real.

94
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,710
I don't think anybody
really did it for real.

95
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:48,590
So they have the car coming at those
age jumping over and Aston Martin or

96
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:51,980
something like that might come. Or the
baby they got picked up by the bird.

97
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,460
That's another fake one that a lot of
people I see on Facebook all the time

98
00:05:55,461 --> 00:05:58,070
where it's like a some babies and this

99
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,330
huge like bird comes over and picks
up the baby and drops it. Like,

100
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,480
have you seen that? No, I
haven't. That's, that's uh,

101
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,640
well that's one that everyone's
still thinks to today is real.

102
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:11,570
But it ended up being a college and that
was like one of their finals that to

103
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:15,740
make that video, like making it viral,
crazy thing to go to school for,

104
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,960
make a viral video of bullshit
viral video. Egal picks up

105
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,410
babies who the eagle swooping in
and snatches is,

106
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,840
yeah. Oh my God. Here's
the thing though, Dude.

107
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,560
An Eagle would definitely do that.
I mean that just,

108
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,410
it doesn't happen very often because
eagles are probably scared of people and

109
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:37,244
they stay clear.

110
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,400
But it's not like we have some fucking
secret friendship with the eagles.

111
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,660
I had a f I feel fed a chicken this
weekend. It's kind of a fucked up story.

112
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:50,390
But my kids found a wounded
hawk and so they, um,

113
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,540
they found this wounded hawk in the
yard and so they brought the hawk,

114
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:58,070
the Hawk to this, uh, like wildlife
rescue center. But before they did,

115
00:06:58,071 --> 00:07:01,470
they had to feed it and the heart
couldn't fly. So what they fed it,

116
00:07:01,471 --> 00:07:05,270
mice and they got mice
from the pet store and um,

117
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,530
they got these little, the thing they
call pinkies, it's really fucked up dude.

118
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,700
It's, it's a baby mouse. It was really,
the whole thing was very creepy.

119
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:18,390
A little pink ones. Yeah. And
so I was like, okay. So they,

120
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,980
they fed him a certain amount of them.
They had one of them that was still alive.

121
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:25,790
They had one of them that was left.
This is like a terror movie, right.

122
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:30,791
So I come home after this weekend on
the road and to discover that they have

123
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:33,980
this little baby mouse that they haven't
fed the Hawk because they brought the

124
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:37,000
hoc to a veterinarian. The veterinarian
takes it to some, you know,

125
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,230
place where they take care
of wounded animals like that.
But now we have this, uh,

126
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,020
this baby pinky that will die.
It will die of starvation.

127
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:47,180
If you don't do anything,
you can't feed it. I mean,

128
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:50,180
it would have to milk you beating with,
I don't know what the fuck you would do.

129
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:51,050
It's so small.

130
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,310
It needs its mother or you bring it
back to the pet store where they're just

131
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:58,310
going to feed it to a snake, right? So I
said, I'll just give it to the chickens.

132
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,110
That's hard to watch,
right? That's a baby feel,

133
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,620
dude.
It's like life is fucked.

134
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:09,900
It's crazy how ruthless life is,
you know? And I didn't have like,

135
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:13,590
my decision was is this, this thing's
going to die or it's going to die.

136
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,680
So I'm going to take the responsibility
away from my hands and and to bring it

137
00:08:16,681 --> 00:08:17,880
to a place where it's going to die,

138
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,850
it's probably already starving to death
because they had it for like over a day

139
00:08:20,851 --> 00:08:23,250
with no food. I'm like, this is so crazy.

140
00:08:23,251 --> 00:08:27,600
But it's like we decide that there's like,
I don't know if it's a meritocracy,

141
00:08:27,601 --> 00:08:30,510
what would you call that?
There's like a hierarchy of animals.

142
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:35,130
There's a hierarchy of value and we
value the life of this wounded hawk more

143
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:36,300
than this baby mouse.

144
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,840
And when I fed it to the chickens had
all came in to play in such a weird,

145
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:45,330
obvious way that this is life.

146
00:08:45,331 --> 00:08:48,600
Like that little thing was huge
and my chickens are not that cute.

147
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,250
They're not that cute. I mean, they're
beautiful. They're interesting animals,

148
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,100
but they don't have a
sense of like this little

149
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,120
tiny little thing did.

150
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,870
But I fed that tiny little thing
to those chickens and it was like,

151
00:09:00,871 --> 00:09:03,920
I don't think, I don't know if I did the
right thing. Like I don't know if they,

152
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,130
in first of all the chickens,

153
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:09,540
that thing wasn't even on the ground
for a second and I mean us second before

154
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:14,490
they mauled it. It was, they are
Goddamn Raptors. They're dinosaurs.

155
00:09:14,491 --> 00:09:18,750
There is chickens are Goddamn
Jurassic Park. We're just really big.

156
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:23,280
So chickens don't do anything but they've
pecked at my daughter's before they'll,

157
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:25,890
they'll check to see if they can eat you,
you know,

158
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:28,500
they see you might be vulnerable,
you might be soft. Oh,

159
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,240
she thought your foot was a warm nope.

160
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,120
She probably was wondering
whether or not shake it, eat you.

161
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,620
That's really what the fuck was going on.

162
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:38,400
She probably wasn't thinking you were
a bug. Chickens are fucking monsters.

163
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:42,570
They're just little monsters. So you can
grab those little fuckers. And you know,

164
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,380
I was hanging out with this finks
cat all week and I was babysitting.

165
00:09:46,381 --> 00:09:51,180
My friends thinks and it's amazing how
different that kind of breed of cat is to

166
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:54,560
a normal cat. This cat
is like a real cat. They,

167
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,170
it's almost like a feral animal.
Like it would come big come up to me,

168
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,570
just grab a Bagel off my plate and go,
this is mine. And they run away and,

169
00:10:01,571 --> 00:10:02,700
and this is just a kid and I'm like,

170
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:06,040
what the fuck are you to like
it just steal from you. Yeah.

171
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,890
And it's theirs. They're hotter than a
normal cat so they're like really hot.

172
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,140
And so you will wake up in the
morning and you'll think, oh my God,

173
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:17,040
who am I sleeping up next to? And it's
a cat. It's, Whoa, they're hotter.

174
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,980
They're hotter and a half. They like
to snuggle cause they have no first.

175
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:23,360
So it's like if anyone's depressed
by when he's catchy, you get,

176
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,020
get a few of them,
you can line them all up.

177
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:29,340
You feel like that you're sleeping with
the person. It's, it's a crazy cat though.

178
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,161
It's,

179
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:33,900
it's an interesting cat
swing a cat without any hair
and sing their wrinkles in

180
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,820
their face, I guess. Yeah. It's
almost like a little thing.

181
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,250
It's not like a cat.
Right?

182
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,880
Like when you think of any mammal that
you keep as a pet would have for when you

183
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:47,760
have a pet that doesn't have further,
that's when shit gets real. Yeah.

184
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:52,680
You've got this weird ratcat thing
that needs to cuddle with you. Ooh,

185
00:10:52,681 --> 00:10:55,480
look at his face or her face it cut.

186
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,130
It'll go right up to my dog is bite
in the ass and then run it away.

187
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,410
It's a big animal, man. Yeah.

188
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,910
You know what's really crazy is
those serve walls. Let's see.

189
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,860
We'll have those circles is that
is what they have the, the bangles.

190
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:12,570
What are the ones that
people have as pets?

191
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:17,250
Like I know Jon Jones as a couple of them.
They'd tear shit up though.

192
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,070
I don't believe in decline.
Your cabinet.

193
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,340
I think if you have one of those
you have to write or, yeah,

194
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,510
that's a real cat that lives in
your house. Yeah, they're big.

195
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,390
I don't know if it's a all
it feels like that's too big.

196
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,090
I think that might be one of those
ones that they have in Africa,

197
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,450
but you don't like get as pets here
but there's ones you can get as pets in

198
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:39,260
America that are just fucking,
it might be called a survival.

199
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,810
But there there's these
Cheyenne ass fucking things man.

200
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,530
And look at the size of that thing
with that little girl. And by the way,

201
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:48,660
like if you have food
and you give them food,

202
00:11:48,661 --> 00:11:51,420
they growl and hiss while
they're eating the food.

203
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,980
Like if you give them like a chicken,
like

204
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,940
some dude at a video of him
online, um, feeding his,

205
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,060
one of those kinds of
cats. And I was like, wow.

206
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,180
He was feeding it chicken
wings and it was just,

207
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,730
it's so like close.
They're so close to like a wildcat,

208
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,980
like are even a regular cat is pretty
fucking wild. They can get pretty wild.

209
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,580
You know, regular cats all kill
every regular cat you have.

210
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,160
You leave them outside with like
a bird or something like that,

211
00:12:21,161 --> 00:12:23,350
they're going to fuck that bird up.
They just kill

212
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,590
are cat fights in Hollywood all the time?
Oh Dude.

213
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,440
He's probably not even a cat fight.

214
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:32,960
It's probably a girl getting our cat
vagina ripped open by those fangs.

215
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,470
Did you see this? This is a, a a guy,

216
00:12:36,471 --> 00:12:40,160
a couple of guys that have a tiger
that just living at their house.

217
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,430
I just thought it was funny because,
uh,

218
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:43,500
wow.

219
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,050
Whoa.
Jesus Christ.

220
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,983
Huh?

221
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,100
Listen to what they're watching. They're
watching some Joe Rogan shit on the TV.

222
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,450
These guys just have a tiger for a pet.
This is the most retarded shit ever.

223
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,420
Look how cute it is.
It's adorable.

224
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,613
Okay.

225
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,150
Where is this APP?
It doesn't say in the description.

226
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:20,080
It's for folks who are watching
or listening and not watching.

227
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:24,630
This is a probably like a, it's not a huge
cat, but it's probably like 300 pounds,

228
00:13:24,631 --> 00:13:29,220
right? Yeah. I would say it's
about the size of a mastiff. Yeah.

229
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,360
It would have to have really big
mastiff. It's, it seems like, okay.

230
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:36,360
Let's say at least 200 plus
pounds, right? At two 50 yeah. Oh,

231
00:13:36,361 --> 00:13:39,380
more than that probably. Yeah. Okay.
Let's call it whatever we were counting,

232
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,523
what am I doing here?

233
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,780
But just it's going to get bigger and
if it decides to kill you, it just does.

234
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,100
It's surprising.

235
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:51,030
It's surprising how often people can
have those cats and it'd be safe though.

236
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,860
I'll tell you that.
It is surprising.

237
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:56,160
You think about how many knuckleheads
have fucking pet tigers and lions and

238
00:13:56,161 --> 00:14:00,450
check. Gregor wants to get one supposedly.
Oh Connor, please don't do that.

239
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:03,180
Please don't make me talk about
you in my act. If you get eaten,

240
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,500
I will have to sir, I love and respect
to you, but did you get eaten by a lion?

241
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:08,570
I'm going to talk about you on a pug.

242
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,960
Just hanging out like bored as fuck.

243
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,590
Wishing I could run outside
and kill things. That's

244
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:20,480
the thing about those animals is they
have these built in things like a man has

245
00:14:20,481 --> 00:14:24,800
or a woman has like a woman has a
built in desire, at least most of them.

246
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:29,450
I don't want to assume that you don't
for wanting some sort of sexual contact.

247
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:34,530
Almost everyone does. Right?
And almost everyone has a,

248
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:38,480
this, this desire to be a part
of the same sort of social group.

249
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:43,160
It's always existed, uh, with our
species. You know, towns and groups,

250
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,560
these animals have always hunted.

251
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:49,850
That's been a part of their life
for as long as there've been tigers.

252
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,540
I don't know how long it's, I
mean, Gee, I don't, I have no idea.

253
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,030
It's got to be thousands and
thousands of generations.

254
00:14:56,031 --> 00:14:58,970
Who knows how many fucking years
tigers had been around the form.

255
00:14:58,971 --> 00:15:03,800
They're in the now and all
that time they'd been killing,
kill, kill, kill, kill,

256
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,723
eat,
eat.

257
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:09,590
It's so arrogant to think that you
could just take them and turn them into

258
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,590
golden labs. You just, that's so,

259
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,750
that's crazy thinking.

260
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,260
It's so silly and it's not
healthy for the animal.

261
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:23,350
That would be like taking a person who
grew up in like rural Ohio and making

262
00:15:25,101 --> 00:15:29,000
them live as a Bushman in Africa.
You know,

263
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:33,110
just taking them to some place where
guys have spears and they have to hunt

264
00:15:33,111 --> 00:15:37,790
lions to become a man. And you wouldn't
be prepared for that kind of Shit.

265
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,100
Neither of these people
prepared to or neither is.

266
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:42,680
There's this tiger rather
prepared to live with people.

267
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,110
It's hold its design.

268
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:50,111
Its whole existence has been
to kill up until this moment.

269
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,830
This is big cat Derek. We've talked
about him a few times on that.

270
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,110
We need to get this dude on.
He trains these things. Yeah,

271
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,180
he lives in Texas and next time we go
to Texas. Do you know, I mean this is,

272
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,080
I I've, there's, there's
thousands of tigers in Texas.

273
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:07,670
Tigers in Texas are like super common
sit because of the weather is or I think

274
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:10,820
it's because Texas has crazy wildlife
laws. I have a whole bit about it.

275
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,530
It's great. They have weird laws.
I W I wouldn't mind having a Lama.

276
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:19,210
Are you living on a lama? They
get, see mama fine. Steve Rinell,

277
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:24,211
his brother has lamas that he takes to
a hunt with them and he packs the lamas

278
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:28,190
out because llamas are like more durable
than horses. They don't get cold.

279
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,280
They just stand outside in the snow.
They don't give a fuck.

280
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,490
Like it doesn't even bother them.
Like you're freaking out and shivering.

281
00:16:34,491 --> 00:16:35,630
The Lama doesn't give a shit.

282
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,990
Have you ever thought about upgrading
your a little pet farm? You know,

283
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:42,710
you've got chickens like get a little
baby goats. Baby goats would be amazing.

284
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:46,140
I have baby go to be cute.
Yeah, I think, um, it's,

285
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:51,140
it would be really hard to have a baby
goat if you eight goats goat. You know,

286
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,500
like if you have a baby sheep and the
new ate lamb, you'd be like, okay,

287
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,040
what are we doing here? You know,
I tell you, man, I've been hunting,

288
00:16:58,041 --> 00:16:59,580
I've been fishing.
Uh,

289
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:04,590
I've seen animals killed that thing
yesterday with that little pinky mouse

290
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:07,910
disturbed me as much as
anything I've ever seen. Well,

291
00:17:07,911 --> 00:17:10,070
maybe you were supposed to save it.
Maybe that's the whole thing.

292
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,680
And we're thinking he's going to raise it,
eat it.

293
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,200
No one had to bring it
back to a pet store.

294
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,860
And then that guy would have fed it to
snakes. That's what they sell them for.

295
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,750
They sell them t to feed snakes
with snakes. First of all,

296
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,450
I'm not saying you shouldn't have a snake.
Don't get me wrong.

297
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,960
Have you love snakes? I'm
not saying you're wrong. If
you love whatever you love,

298
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:32,870
you love, as long as you have a pet
snake and that snake doesn't need a baby,

299
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:36,920
you're allowed to love that pet snake,
but the reality is that pet's neck,

300
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,100
that fucking thing would
eat a baby at any chance.

301
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:45,370
If you left a baby alone with a giant
Anaconda is going to eat that baby 100% of

302
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,140
the time,

303
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:50,550
a hundred percent one
zero zero fucking evil.

304
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,880
They don't give a fuck.
They don't care.

305
00:17:53,881 --> 00:17:56,520
They don't have like a deep attachment
to you because you feed them.

306
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,680
There are snakes as it is a very
insane animal to keep as a pet.

307
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,450
I, but I understand it. I totally
understand it. They're beautiful.

308
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,830
They're amazing and fascinating and you
do get like an electrical feeling when

309
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:12,360
you watch snakes move around.

310
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,640
You get this field because there's like
this primal fear that you have of snakes

311
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:19,410
and when you have a snake as a pet,

312
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,640
it's like it ignites all these
little primal triggers in your body.

313
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,470
Your body's not your body.
To him.

314
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,020
Why we were we friends with is we
make it an alliance with the enemy.

315
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:30,600
Yeah.
My friend,

316
00:18:30,601 --> 00:18:35,601
the snake and it wraps his arms or fucking
body rather around your neck and your

317
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:39,450
arms and you don't, you don't, you're
not afraid. Why are you not afraid?

318
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,640
You don't think there's
that one vegetarian snake,

319
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:44,860
the one snake that would try to be a good
dewar or did you see this video today?

320
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:46,860
I don't even talk.
There are vegetarian snakes.

321
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,590
You see this video of a dog trying to
save a fish's life though it really made

322
00:18:49,591 --> 00:18:49,861
me go,

323
00:18:49,861 --> 00:18:54,750
how is this possible that this dog
knows to try to save this fish is light.

324
00:18:54,751 --> 00:18:56,390
So he's sitting here like,
uh,

325
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:00,330
just putting water on on
the fish and then he goes,

326
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:06,220
it really is, it's on live
leak. Well, you've got it on
Youtube. It's from lively.

327
00:19:06,221 --> 00:19:08,740
Yeah, but it says dog
tries to save a fish. Yeah.

328
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,660
He's literally trying to get water on it

329
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:14,310
and then he's fucking goes to another
fish and actually saves this Fisk the fish

330
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:19,220
that comes back to life a little and
so crazy. How does he know to do it?

331
00:19:19,221 --> 00:19:21,130
He's fucking his nose up
too. That's gotta suck. Yeah.

332
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,630
Like he's checked to see if it's still
alive. Is that giving CPR to a fish?

333
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,180
Is that a golden lab?
It looks like no,

334
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:29,910
it looks like more of a point
year title type of an animal.

335
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,190
It's like one of those Japanese
mixed with without cause she,

336
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,040
you mixed with a retriever.
Maybe

337
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:39,720
like maybe a Shiba Inu. Yeah.
Yeah. That's weird man. There's,

338
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,770
there's an intelligence that
animals have a very bizarre,

339
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,820
so I mean like we kind of think that the
only way to know things is someone has

340
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:52,110
to teach you them. That's kind of
how human beings have, we, we've,

341
00:19:52,111 --> 00:19:54,600
we've sort of accepted
that as just a fact.

342
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,510
The only way to know something
is if someone teaches you.

343
00:19:57,511 --> 00:20:00,150
But there's a lot of shit
you know, that, you know,

344
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,470
like are a lot of reactions that you have
that are, that are built in like, um,

345
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,090
Rupert Sheldrake.

346
00:20:06,091 --> 00:20:09,570
Cause the guy's been on the podcast
before and he had this excellent analogy

347
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:14,310
about, um, what children in, um,

348
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,300
big cities are afraid of.
And that they're afraid of scary monsters,

349
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:19,890
even though they don't
have a reference point.

350
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:23,820
They didn't never really seen a monster,
but they're afraid of scary monsters.

351
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,460
And I believe I might be butchering this,

352
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:31,461
but I think his supposition
was that what's going on
is that they have this fear

353
00:20:32,821 --> 00:20:36,120
that's built in from back when they
were little monkeys from when they were

354
00:20:36,121 --> 00:20:39,390
hiding from like leopards and Jaguars.
These,

355
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:43,370
these beasts set would have
dark teeth or you know,

356
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:47,230
bright white teeth and they would be dark
and he would hide the night and try to

357
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,064
get you,

358
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:51,340
you know, cause that probably
really happened at one point.

359
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:54,610
There was probably this animal
that hunted in the darkness, right?

360
00:20:54,611 --> 00:20:58,750
And it killed a lot of the ancestors of
all the people and somehow or another

361
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,510
that's in our system,
somehow or another,

362
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:04,300
it's built in like when animals know
that they should be breastfeeding.

363
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:08,640
But that's all built in. Like there's
all these reward systems and is,

364
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,640
there's all these things built in to
make sure that you continue the same

365
00:21:12,641 --> 00:21:13,360
behavior,

366
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,560
the releasement of oxytocin or though
the love feeling that you have with

367
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,450
comrades and friends and family.
Like why is all that stuff there?

368
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:26,080
It's all that is built in to make
sure that we keep moving forward.

369
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:30,610
So we think that there's,
that's all, that's where all
our information comes from.

370
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,350
All information comes
from human knowledge.

371
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,600
All our information comes from the
things that we've written down,

372
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:36,580
the things that we've learned
about the way we behave.

373
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:40,210
I think some of it is in the bones.

374
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:43,150
I think some of it is deepen the bones.

375
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:47,740
Like it's almost like you're born with
a certain amount of information. Cat,

376
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:50,350
cat litter box. Yeah.
I mean you're a baby,

377
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,250
a cat litter box when you had cats pretty
much know what a cat litter boxes from

378
00:21:54,251 --> 00:21:56,740
being a kitten. And it's like,
wait, you're such a baby.

379
00:21:56,741 --> 00:22:00,460
But somehow we put a box down with
some weird shit in it, you know,

380
00:22:00,461 --> 00:22:04,780
to go in that box and then cover
it up and it's weird. Yeah,

381
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,930
that's a good point. Yeah. That's a real
good point there. It's built into them.

382
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,070
Yeah. And there's this the case with a
lot of different behavior that we see in

383
00:22:12,071 --> 00:22:15,730
nature. Right? Almost
all of it. Instinctual.

384
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,290
There's a few learned moments.

385
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:20,680
Like one of the things that I
saw that was fascinating was um,

386
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,530
orcas trying to teach
their young how to hunt.

387
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,360
They're teaching their young how to
turn over ice islands so that they would

388
00:22:28,361 --> 00:22:33,361
make the seals slip down into their
mouths and they would put these seals back

389
00:22:33,521 --> 00:22:36,820
up and they'd do it all over again.
And I was like, Whoa, this is fucked.

390
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,810
Was the seals are penguins, one of
those. Um, but when they did it,

391
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:44,470
it was so obvious that they were teaching
their teaching their little babies.

392
00:22:44,471 --> 00:22:47,710
Like, Whoa, they're teaching them
tactics. But that's just like people,

393
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,580
you have to learn like hunting tactics.
You have to learn to stay away though,

394
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:53,620
you know,
you can't have the wind in your face.

395
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:56,170
That means the animals you're
looking at or the wind behind you,

396
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,450
I mean is animals you will,
you're looking at,

397
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,150
it's going to be in their face so they're
going to smell you like there's all

398
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:04,780
these things they have to learn. Okay,
got it. I teach you, but how much of an,

399
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,240
how much do you have to
tell them to actual hunt?

400
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,570
Like how much is that as in like,
uh,

401
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:13,210
like some sort of a memory system
that there's a reward for doing that.

402
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:17,500
Like you ever go fishing? Yeah. You like
that feeling. It's awesome. It's great.

403
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:21,700
Except for taking the thing out of the
fish. It's grass does not literally,

404
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,820
but you know that feeling that
you get when you catch a big fish,

405
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,510
like a good fish that you can eat like a
real one. You're like, well I'll ride to,

406
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:30,070
we're the fucking eat this fish now.

407
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:35,430
It's like this weird primal sort
of response thing that we don't,

408
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,140
for whatever reason,
don't talk about it.

409
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:42,210
But that's why it's fun to even
catch and release fish. You know?

410
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,350
Like Ari and I were in a Alaska and there,

411
00:23:44,351 --> 00:23:47,690
there was like a point in time while we
were there where you could only catch

412
00:23:47,691 --> 00:23:50,090
and release because they had this,
um,

413
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,110
they have this like cutoff point where
if you don't have a certain amount of

414
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:55,400
salmon going through the weird,

415
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,740
they worry that the numbers
might be low right then,

416
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,020
which is so crazy because they may,

417
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,640
if you catch and release like the
chances of you harming the animal is like

418
00:24:04,641 --> 00:24:05,720
pretty fucking high.

419
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,890
It's like the chances of the
animal actually living is probably,

420
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,450
people don't want to say it,

421
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:16,690
but I researched it after we did the trip
and there were thinking that probably

422
00:24:16,821 --> 00:24:18,320
should have researched it
before we did the trip.

423
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:22,700
But they were thinking that like maybe
as many as 20% of all the fish that you

424
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:26,810
catch and release wind up dying. Oh yeah.
They get fucked up from those hooks,

425
00:24:26,811 --> 00:24:29,300
which totally makes sense.
Right.

426
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,210
But if you just make them see
if they could keep one fish,

427
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,390
which is like they usually do,
and king salmon fishing,

428
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,440
you would catch one and you would keep
that one and that one would die and

429
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:43,160
that's all you would be able to fish for
it. You'd have to stop unless you keep,

430
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,230
you can keep one and do catch and release,

431
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:47,300
which is catch and release
is kind of bullshit.

432
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,160
Yeah, cause it's pretty much you're just
getting a shotgun to the face and go.

433
00:24:50,161 --> 00:24:52,670
Hopefully you live,
because I know Barb,

434
00:24:52,671 --> 00:24:56,050
a giant as Barb hooked into your face.
Yeah,

435
00:24:56,051 --> 00:24:58,500
I catch and release is kind of bullshit
and that's the only way I've actually

436
00:24:58,501 --> 00:25:01,560
fish. I've never actually fixed
where I was allowed to eat the fish,

437
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,320
these guys to saving a hammerhead
shark. Hammerhead sharks. Okay.

438
00:25:04,321 --> 00:25:06,060
Here's another hierarchy.
Example.

439
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,250
Hammerhead sharks are
cooler than regular sharks.

440
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:12,960
I'd be way more likely to
save a hammerhead shark than
a great white because his

441
00:25:12,961 --> 00:25:16,290
face has already sat enough, was
kind of cool. He's like an alien.

442
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:21,990
That's crazy. Why don't they turn it over
and put it back in the water? Hook out.

443
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,360
Oh, it's got a hook in it. Yeah.
Oh, someone caught it? Yeah. Wow.

444
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,750
So did they catch it accidentally?
Mm,

445
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:36,520
well that's just part of fishing. If you
accidentally catch a shark like, well,

446
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,613
but,

447
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:41,250
but it's in a weird that we have this
like response that we want this thing to

448
00:25:41,251 --> 00:25:44,460
live this murderous fucking feed machine.

449
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,770
All it does is feed and we wanted to live.
It's super bizarre.

450
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,760
Super Bizarre that we want that
thing to live. I had a fucking point.

451
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,840
What was my point about fish? Oh
that eve, there's this reward,

452
00:25:57,841 --> 00:25:59,550
this instinct thing that
we have built in it.

453
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,180
Even when you like catch and release,
it's triggered even what it's like,

454
00:26:03,181 --> 00:26:06,270
there's a trigger that makes you
want to do that and it's built.

455
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:10,140
I think it's some information that people
are born with or at least a response

456
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,530
to a reality that you're born with.
You know, in a very weird way,

457
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:18,330
because it used to be that x amount of
years ago and for who knows how many

458
00:26:18,331 --> 00:26:19,560
thousands of generations.

459
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,320
That's how you made sure he stayed
alive when you caught a fish.

460
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:27,390
So it gave you like this reward
again. We got one, you know,

461
00:26:27,391 --> 00:26:30,870
some fucking Gollum type shit
when he finds the ring, you know.

462
00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:32,790
And even though all
these generations later,

463
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:36,360
we're still getting our fish on styrofoam
containers. When you catch a fish,

464
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:40,410
there's this weird release.
Maybe you man,

465
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,250
maybe there's something wrong with you.
Maybe you're just a fucking

466
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:46,470
asshole and you're like, oh fine, thanks.

467
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,470
I think it's amazing.

468
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:55,210
In Ohio they have a fishing,
but they have ponds like at the work,

469
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,680
like the workplaces,
uh,

470
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,130
my mom used to work at this place and
they had issue mungus ponds at lunch you

471
00:27:00,131 --> 00:27:05,110
could just go and fish and you know, and
just chill out, not think about work.

472
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,730
But you had to uh,
you know,

473
00:27:06,731 --> 00:27:11,050
throw it back in and then go back to
work in maybe you don't really see shit

474
00:27:11,051 --> 00:27:14,940
like that. Like these big corporations
and stuff like that. Fishing pond, right.

475
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,230
They stock up with interesting fish.

476
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,310
Well, they do that. I think in like
when people have like a lot of money,

477
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:25,960
like down south they'll have like a lake
stocked with Bass and shit like that.

478
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:28,750
And they'll take clients to it and stuff.
I know they do that.

479
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:33,250
Like people that have a lot of money
that have um, a big corporations,

480
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:37,840
a lot of times they'll, they'll have like
a box at like say like staples center.

481
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,130
So anything that's playing there they
get to go see, which is kind of cool man.

482
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:45,880
Imagine if you owned like some network
or something like that and you could just

483
00:27:45,881 --> 00:27:50,650
go take your friends to a button,
whatever it is. Lakers game, UFC fight,

484
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,570
uh, Kevin Hart's playing. There you
go see it. That's fucking baller.

485
00:27:55,870 --> 00:28:00,490
That might be like ultimate baller
shit to have like a box. Is that okay?

486
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,060
Boxworks am I misrepresenting it?
Oh yeah. Yeah. It's a corporate,

487
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:05,550
that's how they sell the stadium stuff.
You have to buy that.

488
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:09,870
They sell all those pretty much the
tickets as well. In some cases you do,

489
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:12,420
but depending on who you are and how
big and how much money you spend on your

490
00:28:12,421 --> 00:28:16,560
box. So what if you like one of those
dudes from like Microsoft? Like if you,

491
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:20,400
one of those, uh, Bruce bomber guys, like
the guy who goes crazy. Walmart owns the,

492
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,230
Steve Balmer owns the clippers.
Yeah.

493
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,740
So he owns part of the arena two
or something like that. That's,

494
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,070
that's high level shit.
Yeah. My owns a gun.

495
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,980
My friend's dad used to have out box in
Columbus, but it was Columbus clippers,

496
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:36,850
but it's Columbus clippers box
and a AAA baseball team. Really?

497
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:38,400
But you'd go there.
It was really cool.

498
00:28:38,401 --> 00:28:41,220
It was like this really nice
little they had, it was catered.

499
00:28:41,221 --> 00:28:43,440
They had waiters that just came
in and everything was free.

500
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:48,270
You'd just had a stocked fridge, uh,
all the hotdogs you wanted and it was

501
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:52,430
wow. That's cool. Yeah. Eddie Bravo
went to the UFC at one of those.

502
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:55,310
He has a friend who has one of those
at the staples center and I was like,

503
00:28:55,311 --> 00:28:58,790
what is that? Like? He's like, dude,
it's crazy. It's all upholstered. Yeah.

504
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:03,840
Leather and hors d'oeuvres and fucking
the best beer on ice and wine and one for

505
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,930
Monday night.
Raw event one night.

506
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:13,230
[inaudible] we've got free tickets
because my boss at the time is his,

507
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,910
one of his good friend has managers,
uh, or he's the manager of John Sienna.

508
00:29:18,911 --> 00:29:20,380
So we got access to the event,

509
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:23,290
but there was a cavs basketball
game going on the same night.

510
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:26,530
Some of my friends stayed in the box,
watch the TV of the basketball game,

511
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:31,030
listen to the raw going on outside,
and then when something cool came out,

512
00:29:31,031 --> 00:29:33,100
we just like took two
steps and then washed it,

513
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,600
came back and watch the basketball game.

514
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:39,590
I need to go. I don't give a
shit enough about sports to,

515
00:29:39,591 --> 00:29:41,890
to like a local follow him,

516
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,220
but I need to go to an event.
I need to go to like one,

517
00:29:45,221 --> 00:29:48,780
like real good basketball games. Maybe.
Maybe I'll get it. I was hoping to,

518
00:29:48,781 --> 00:29:51,580
calves are going to play the clippers
and talk in the sea and Lebron play this

519
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,700
year, but it didn't happen. God dammit.
If you want to go see Lebron play,

520
00:29:54,701 --> 00:29:58,030
let's pick a spot and we'll find out
where they're going to be and we'll book a

521
00:29:58,031 --> 00:30:01,810
show in that town and we'll go see Lebron.
And Cleveland is he like,

522
00:30:01,811 --> 00:30:05,790
is he like the guy like the Jordan of
our generation's space jam too, right?

523
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,130
I can't believe I said that because this
is a running joke in the UFC because

524
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,630
Mike Goldberg one time asked me if
Travis looter was the Michael Jordan of

525
00:30:13,631 --> 00:30:17,320
Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. And I was
like, okay, this is a, yeah, no,

526
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,880
but you want to see Lebron if you could
say, but just to finish my sentence,

527
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:26,020
Travis Luder is like this bad ass
American Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt.

528
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:30,010
He's like, like look super, super high
level. Like when he was in the UFC,

529
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:31,180
I was super excited because I was like,

530
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:34,600
this guy's gonna submit a lot of fucking
people that you haven't seen submitted

531
00:30:34,601 --> 00:30:38,080
before. His left, his level
of Jujitsu, super high level.

532
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,810
But when Goldberg was saying like
the Michael Jordan of it, I was like,

533
00:30:40,811 --> 00:30:44,410
that's like so cliche that people do that.
They always have to say like his,

534
00:30:44,411 --> 00:30:49,010
he the tiger woods of pool
as he, the Michael Jordan
number zillion just to like,

535
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:54,070
no, he's fucking Travis. Looter
like, that's he's Badass.
That's who he is. You know?

536
00:30:54,071 --> 00:30:57,070
I said the Michael Jordan of Brazilian
Jiu Jitsu is Marcello Garcia,

537
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,780
but that was just cause he's at the time,

538
00:30:58,781 --> 00:31:01,960
at least for sure the best
and most spectacular guy.

539
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,070
But he's not the Michael Jordan.
He's Mike, he's Marcello Garcia.

540
00:31:06,071 --> 00:31:10,240
He's his own dude. He doesn't have to be
the Michael Jordan of something. You Fox.

541
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:14,740
It's like when, when anybody tries to say
it's like our version of nigger, like,

542
00:31:14,741 --> 00:31:18,190
no, it's not. No, you got
your own fucking insult.

543
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:21,970
You can say it's your version
of the n word. You just,

544
00:31:21,971 --> 00:31:26,710
you're not allowed to know. It
means something bad to you. Okay.

545
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:30,720
I get it. I get it. See, I've, um,

546
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,370
I've fucking no tolerance for that.
What do you think about this hall?

547
00:31:34,371 --> 00:31:37,990
Cogan shakes that tired.
It makes me sad.

548
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,500
Makes me sad that he talks like that.
That's what it makes me sad.

549
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:46,270
Hulk Hogan said a bunch of shit about his
daughter dating black guys. Like, man,

550
00:31:47,050 --> 00:31:51,490
come on in 2015 or whatever the
fuck this video was years ago.

551
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,460
Wasn't in that sex tape.
Whatever. It's from man.

552
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:59,110
It's sad to me that he thinks like that.
It's sad. That shit's sad. It's just sad.

553
00:31:59,111 --> 00:32:02,350
It's just, it's just people, man,
that guy didn't ask to be born black.

554
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:05,620
You didn't ask to be born white.
There's cool people,

555
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:08,160
cool fucking people that are black.
Um,

556
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,530
some of my favorite people I've
met of all time have been black.

557
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,350
The idea that you would be upset that
your daughter would date someone just

558
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:17,650
because they're black. To me it
makes me sad. It made me mad at him.

559
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,890
Maybe I'd be mad if I was black.
It makes me sad.

560
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,400
Makes me sad that he thinks that way.
You know? And it wasn't even funny.

561
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,300
It wasn't like you were saying
something funny, you know,

562
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:28,790
if he was saying something funny,
man, I'll cut him a break. You know,

563
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:32,200
maybe we try to be funny. He, he's
like, well, I, I could do some bad news.

564
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,630
The good news is, you know, your,

565
00:32:34,631 --> 00:32:39,631
your daughter's dating a strapping
six foot four super athlete.

566
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,370
The bad news.
His name is Tyrone white.

567
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:49,160
And what color do you think
Tyrone? Is He a white,

568
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:54,320
he's a giant. He's black and he was
always shiny. He's like oily. He's oily.

569
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:59,340
His whole body is like slippery and
muscular and oily and he's got addicted.

570
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:04,010
It looks like an eel like an evil eel and,
and your daughter loves it.

571
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,190
She loves it. She's super
happy about it. Right.

572
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:13,430
Okay. I just don't, I don't, you
know, it just makes me feel sad.

573
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,850
I don't think he's racist though.
I think maybe this, yes. No,

574
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,930
what he said was racist.
Anybody that says he's not a racist.

575
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:26,060
Maybe he says things in private and he
thinks of them as being in private and he

576
00:33:26,061 --> 00:33:31,061
wants some sort of escape from the PC
world that he finds himself in where he is

577
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:34,190
public, where he's public. He has
to have these cans, statements.

578
00:33:34,191 --> 00:33:35,450
You never hear them swear.

579
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:39,560
You never hear him talk about anything
like controversial. He's a businessman.

580
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:43,310
He's selling whole Kogan. It's not
even his name. It's his brand. Okay.

581
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,380
Maybe when you live a life like that or
you're this fucking American superhero

582
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:50,570
years old, years old, you're
always doing an act. You know,

583
00:33:50,571 --> 00:33:54,170
he's always whole Cogan oh, commanders
running rod bro. And I interviewed him.

584
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,040
I interviewed him with UFC. It was one
of my all time favorite interviews man.

585
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:02,840
Put pull that shit up. Yeah,
he was awesome cause spike
TV. Ha. It was an honor.

586
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:03,830
It really was an honor.

587
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,980
There's two people that I've interviewed
where I felt like, well there's a bunch.

588
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:11,150
Obviously Neil degrasse Tyson and uh,
Brian Cox.

589
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:14,490
There's a lot of people that I met
where it was an honor, but hulk Hogan,

590
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:18,170
I was like, this guy is, this is
fucking Hulk Hogan man. This is,

591
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,680
I'm can't believe that I've
somehow or another have a job.

592
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,500
No wrestlers.

593
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,740
Oh, time, sports and
entertainment. Huge personality.

594
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:31,400
The one and only Hulk Hogan.
Welcome aboard sir. How are you?

595
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,580
Thank you my brother Joe.

596
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,670

better than this brother.

597
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:40,610
These guys are going to war out here.
It's unbelievable.

598
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:44,840
Now you've made this an animate fights
before you a UFC fan. Oh, I'm a huge fan.

599
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:45,690

600
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:51,190
Now I understand that you have recently
announced a partnership with TNA

601

602

Spike TV. Tell us more about that.

603
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,060

our partners with spike.

604
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,410
I'm partners with Dixie Carter.

I'm partners with TNA and we just
got the green right brother onto my,

606
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,960

I'm annoying. I'm annoying me right now.

607
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,050
Maybe I'd be less annoying if I
watched him ever. Why hate watching

608
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,270
Paul Coconut? TNA. We're

Wrestle in TNA. We'll brother.

612

613

but you never know. I'm going over there
to take over the maniacs or common.

614
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,040
All the teenage brother for racist
might just Hogan is common back.

615
00:35:52,681 --> 00:35:57,390
Ladies and gentlemen, TNA wrestling live

616
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:00,550

617
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,460
I'm on you. What are you going
to do? That's the good question.

618
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:06,960
Thank you very much sir.

619
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:12,380
Call me brother. At least a dozen
times. Yeah, that's a lot of brothers.

620
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:16,760
I'll die happy. I sat behind him
that I was there that, that that day.

621
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:20,120
And I sat behind him and I remember
the whole time he had this little comb

622
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:23,090
anyways, just combing his hair
slowly while watching the UFC.

623
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,040
He's put on a show man. He's
smart. Look Hulk. Here's the deal.

624
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,860
Hoke Hogan is still talked about today.

625
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:35,960
It's 2015 when I was in high school,
I was in high school in the 80s.

626
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,670
The Hawk was the fucking man. Okay.
He was a fucking man back then.

627
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:45,530
He was in rocky. Three man or
four? Three, four, three, three,

628
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,370
three. Which ones? The Russian. What's
four? Then four is Russia. Russia,

629
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:53,390
who's in four? No, three was
mr t and hulk Hogan. Right.

630
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:56,750
And it wasn't for, was the Russian all
you're right, you're right. You're right.

631
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:59,120
It was three, five of us and
shitty way. So those three,

632
00:36:59,121 --> 00:37:01,430
I was totally in high school
cause I went with this, uh,

633
00:37:01,431 --> 00:37:03,840
this chick that I was dating and
I remember it very well. Shit,

634
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:07,220
the best popes all time.
All time.

635
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,170
So I remember,

636
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:12,230
I remember that movie based on the
check that I want with not hilarious.

637
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,250
He do that you have like those
highschool moments we just like, oh yeah,

638
00:37:16,251 --> 00:37:18,980
that's like
pimps are great.

639
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:23,440
So Hulk Hogan said some racist shit.
You don't have to.

640
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:27,920
Par Part of me is like, yeah,
it's sad that he thinks that
way. I don't know. Again,

641
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:32,600
if if you are black and you're angry
at it, I understand. I don't get mad.

642
00:37:32,601 --> 00:37:35,870
I get sad book with that one
especially. But I, I just,

643
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:40,460
it makes me wonder how many people
talk like that when no one's around.

644
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:43,590
How many people say like racist Shit,
whether you're holding me every day.

645
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:47,660
I've talked about this all the time.
It's my favorite thing to do to animals.

646
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:52,100
Like, but no one could be around
unless I'm dating them and I just,

647
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:56,960
I use, I mean I used the f word, the
n word, like I, I just f for Gay.

648
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:01,650
The gay slur. Yeah. Cause I think
saying it till dog as well. It's,

649
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,380
but you're doing it for amusement.

650
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:07,910
It's funny because you don't get to say
it anymore. You're silly guy though. See,

651
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:11,720
this is the thing, you're silly. And
one of the things about you haven't,

652
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:15,170
excuse me. Pardon me. One of the
things about you is, which is funny,

653
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,880
is where you automatically like gravitate
towards the inappropriate shit to say

654
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:24,050
like racially, sexually, you automatically
do it. Like you can't help yourself. So,

655
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,710
but you're not a mean person. You
certainly aren't racist. Like I know you,

656
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:31,400
you're never ever racist. I'm never
racist. I'm just mildly joking.

657
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:36,070
It's just hilarious. It's fun.
Wrong Shit. Yeah. That's why I'm

658
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,170
a comic. Yeah, right.
But that's different.

659
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,730
Like if someone somehow or no, they're
like stuck a microphone. Your cat's ass.

660
00:38:41,731 --> 00:38:43,170
Like one of those jewels
that you have in there

661
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:46,990
put on Instagram catchall
but yours. I can't believe
those are real. First of all.

662
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,960
Is that real? I don't think
so. You can't be kind of,

663
00:38:49,961 --> 00:38:53,440
we get mad Catz not just going to walk
around with a diamond and it's as if it's

664
00:38:53,441 --> 00:38:55,720
a sticker.
I was thinking that sticker might work,

665
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,820
but anything to cover the
butthole would be great.

666
00:38:57,821 --> 00:39:00,700
They can clean their ass with their
tongue. They would feel it and clean it.

667
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:04,630
Right. Uh, not if it's
like really strong sticker

668
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,410
and they wouldn't give a shit,
then they would die from impact.

669
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:12,630
Did Shit. Yeah. That's, I don't know.

670
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:16,190
I had a point before all this got started.
What was the beginning of it all

671
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:21,230
taught racism saying racist shit
cause we don't get to, you know, it's,

672
00:39:21,231 --> 00:39:24,530
it's fun to say Shit Racist,
not racist shit. My Shit,

673
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:26,450
we're not supposed to a Voodoo shit.

674
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:26,791
Yeah.

675
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:29,580
The differences are that they think that
like if you were saying anything that

676
00:39:29,581 --> 00:39:33,570
was racist, it would be in jest
and in just doesn't bother people.

677
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,360
Cause they know they don't, they, you
might have to apologize, like, look,

678
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,840
I didn't mean for this to get public,
but I certainly said it in jest.

679
00:39:39,841 --> 00:39:42,120
I was just fucking around with my friends.
I love everybody.

680
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,420
Then you probably could, you know,
people would accept your apology,

681
00:39:45,421 --> 00:39:47,580
they'd be mad at you,
but they'd accept your apology.

682
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,390
But what he was sale is not
really in chest, you know,

683
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:53,310
at least it didn't seem like it.
It was just,

684
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,180
it was just an uncomfortable thing that,
you know,

685
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:01,560
and I don't think that the guy at work,
however old he is, 60 something years old.

686
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,320
I don't think he, he's
done learning. You know,

687
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,970
it's not like you should
just write them off.

688
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,550
He should just talk about
why he said it and what he,

689
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:12,810
what he you felt and you know, and then
he, sorry. I think people can accept that.

690
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:14,340
I don't think I'll glove into the bad guy.

691
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,610
I think sometimes people do things like
that and everybody all of a sudden is

692
00:40:17,611 --> 00:40:22,290
like super mad at him. They
hate him forever. He fucked up.

693
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,820
You know?
That's what I think.

694
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,310
I think you fucked up and he fucked
up thinking like that and he probably

695
00:40:26,311 --> 00:40:27,990
realizes he fucked up when he feels it.

696
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:31,610
I think it's also something though that
a lot of people have to like take their

697
00:40:31,611 --> 00:40:35,480
own. Like everyone's, it's so easy to
blame or say, hey, that guy said that.

698
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:38,240
But if you were to take your
whole life and not knowing it,

699
00:40:38,241 --> 00:40:42,740
your parts were recorded. Oh, you're
fucked. Everyone's fucked. We're fucked.

700
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:46,850
But it's really easy to point like, Oh,
this guy is racist, blah, blah, blah.

701
00:40:46,851 --> 00:40:49,820
He's a horrible person. But like any
of us, you can take it, like you said,

702
00:40:49,821 --> 00:40:52,760
put a microphone in my cats
by hole like that and, and,

703
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:57,940
and record me and take 10 seconds off
of my life and air and put it online and

704
00:40:58,941 --> 00:40:59,610
I'm fucked.

705
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:04,350
Yeah. Well that's everything man.
Everything. I mean, anything you do,

706
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:08,910
if you're doing an all the time, you're
gonna make mistakes. Whether it's walking,

707
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,740
if someone just wanted to take clips,

708
00:41:10,741 --> 00:41:14,220
are you walking into shit and
they followed you around all day?

709
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:17,700
How many times do you walk into things?
I walk into things not paying attention.

710
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,720
I'm talking,

711
00:41:18,721 --> 00:41:22,980
I accidentally bump into a wall or I hit
a door when I didn't mean to hit a door.

712
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,330
It happens,
right?

713
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:29,450
But if someone just followed you all the
time and took those snippets and splice

714
00:41:29,671 --> 00:41:33,770
them together and go, here's
Jamie Vernon, look at this. Fuck.

715
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,640
Just walking into walls everywhere
he goes. But most of the time,

716
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,470
the vast majority of the time,

717
00:41:39,471 --> 00:41:43,130
you elegantly navigate your
way through the universe.

718
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:46,940
But the Times where you bounce
your car door off the look,

719
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:50,270
I understand if you get upset,
if somebody dings your car door,

720
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,610
but who the fuck hasn't
Dang someone's car door.

721
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,790
Please step up and raise your hand
cause I've never met this person.

722
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,160
I have dang people's car doors.
Okay.

723
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:02,570
And I've think people's car doors
and left a note and told them email,

724
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,910
email me or whatever
and I'll give you money.

725
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:09,440
It's been a long time since I did that,
but I did that. Okay, that's not true.

726
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:09,920
Wait a minute,

727
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,420
I didn't ding their car door accidentally
hit her bumper and I left a small mark.

728
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,450
Okay. I have pinged at guy's door. Not
like definitely dinged guides or not.

729
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:20,780
Now that I'm thinking about it,

730
00:42:20,781 --> 00:42:25,781
the only times I've ever left a a note
of left a note at least once that I can

731
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:30,220
remember. That's not foggy. And that was
cause I think a ding there. Pumper. Yeah,

732
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:35,240
I've dinged but it didn't leave a mark
door dinner. I'm trying to think, man,

733
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:38,060
it's been a long time.
I'm super careful of it now.

734
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:43,340
But back before I was a car nut
especially I know of Dang a few doors.

735
00:42:43,341 --> 00:42:47,470
I'm, I'm guilty as charged a hundred
percent. That's a fucking bad feeling.

736
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,400
You don't think about it. You're
like, you're in your own head.

737
00:42:49,401 --> 00:42:52,730
I gotta get this done. I gotta pay
that Bill. Fuck. And then dunk.

738
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:59,060
Can't always be responsible for paying
attention. You're gonna make mistakes.

739
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,860
You all responsible.
I don't mean that.

740
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:04,070
What I mean is you can't be
held accountable forever.

741
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,140
You got to let it go at
a certain point in time.

742
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,970
So I think even with this hulk Hogan
Guy, he fucked up. Yeah, he fucked up.

743
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:13,760
He shouldn't. Yeah, you're right. He
definitely shouldn't think like that.

744
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,150
But if we had to follow you around stupid
and make a fucking clip of all your

745
00:43:17,151 --> 00:43:17,810
life,

746
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:21,980
all the blunders you do in the creepy
shit you say in the weird fucking stuff,

747
00:43:21,981 --> 00:43:26,080
you Google, guess what?
You're a mess to your, oh,

748
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:27,620
you're way more of a mess.

749
00:43:27,621 --> 00:43:32,000
If I splice it all together and some
sort of a crazy hit real, you know,

750
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:36,110
and that's, it's easy to do for a
guy like a whole Cogan, you know,

751
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,090
it's easy to do. He's
public, he's so public.

752
00:43:38,091 --> 00:43:41,720
He's there all the time and that's what
pretty much what TMZ does and what they

753
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:43,130
make money for it. They're
like, Hey, you know what?

754
00:43:43,131 --> 00:43:44,720
We're going to go after Lindsay Lohan.

755
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:47,750
Every single thing Lindsay
Lohan or Justin Bieber does,

756
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:49,970
where we're going to make
sure everyone knows about it.

757
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,170
Here's my feeling about TMC and I'm
being completely honest about it.

758
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:58,850
Most of what they're doing as far as
like doing this stuff and this guy got

759
00:43:58,851 --> 00:44:03,410
arrested for drunk driving and the mostly
what they're doing is making fun of

760
00:44:03,411 --> 00:44:08,411
preposterous shit that we actually
probably would make fun of to like,

761
00:44:08,751 --> 00:44:12,260
let's be honest, like every time
something happens like Lake Lindsay Lohan,

762
00:44:12,261 --> 00:44:14,420
we can say like, oh, they
report on Lindsay Lohan,

763
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:16,460
but meanwhile we fucking talk about it.

764
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:20,150
We will talk about on this podcast if
something comes up on this podcast.

765
00:44:20,151 --> 00:44:22,010
It's crazy in the news
that someone has done,

766
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,380
you're like shook night runs
over somebody with his truck.

767
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,380
We're gonna fucking talk about it and
where are we going to get our video from?

768
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,360
We're going to get a video from TMZ.

769
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:35,110
Everybody wants to that what they're
doing is inherently evil and I him,

770
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:36,751
man,

771
00:44:36,751 --> 00:44:40,710
I'm not sure cause it seems like they
only care about stuff that's happening.

772
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:44,580
They don't have to go after people and
peer into their lives and find out who

773
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:48,420
likes strap ons and he, you know, who's
into watching weird shit. You know,

774
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,680
they don't have to do that because there's
so much content just by people being

775
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:58,890
ridiculous that I don't
necessarily see them as evil.

776
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:04,050
I see them as just, it's a, it's
a new segment of entertainment.

777
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:08,220
I mean there's a lot of in and stand
in front of Kanye West House taking

778
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:10,530
pictures of them and shit.
There's a lot of that stuff that goes on.

779
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,030
But that's just, that's happening.
He's crazy. The whole thing is crazy.

780
00:45:15,031 --> 00:45:19,020
It's just crazy circus they put on, you
know, they, they did a reality show.

781
00:45:19,021 --> 00:45:20,610
She did a crazy sex tape.

782
00:45:20,611 --> 00:45:25,470
It's like all this stuff is generating
all this attention and someone comes in

783
00:45:25,471 --> 00:45:27,660
and looks at all the attention.
He goes, look at this crazy shit.

784
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,490
It's pretty much what we do.
Right? Yeah. I mean, you know, we,

785
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:36,540
we might not like break the news.
We might not when we're not journalists,

786
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:40,650
but we are, I mean, what does reporting,
what does that mean? What do, what do,

787
00:45:40,651 --> 00:45:41,484
what do you mean?

788
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:45,330
Are you talking about stuff or are
you just simply reporting the facts?

789
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:50,570
Cause most of those shows lay a heavy
bit of editing and the editorial review

790
00:45:51,421 --> 00:45:55,230
and ideas into their pieces. You
know, even like TMZ, when they're,

791
00:45:55,231 --> 00:45:58,380
they're making fun of something,
it's pretty obvious or making fun of it.

792
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:00,810
They're not reporters, you
know, what are they doing?

793
00:46:00,811 --> 00:46:05,010
They're doing like some new form of
entertainment. It's not that bad.

794
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:09,390
Like everybody pretends that stuff pad.
What's just as bad as all the people.

795
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,390
Like when you, especially when you're
covering reality stars and, and,

796
00:46:12,391 --> 00:46:16,710
and like real housewives type shit,
like none of it's bad,

797
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,830
but if anything's bad, it's like, what
are you, who's putting that on TV?

798
00:46:19,831 --> 00:46:21,240
Like what are you doing?
Like what's that?

799
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:23,790
And if they do something crazy
and someone follows them,

800
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,260
the people that follow them are bad.

801
00:46:25,261 --> 00:46:29,310
But you're not bad for putting these wacky
fuckers on TV and feeding him Tequila

802
00:46:29,311 --> 00:46:32,400
all day and putting cameras in their
face and getting them in a position where

803
00:46:32,401 --> 00:46:35,790
they hope that maybe there'll be able
to chew through their $50,000 in fucking

804
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:40,440
student debt by being an asshole on
TV and generating a following. Right.

805
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:43,830
And becoming some fucking crazy fan
favorite on the show because he's the one

806
00:46:43,831 --> 00:46:47,130
who likes to throw drinks in people's
face and fucking get gangster.

807
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:50,270
You know what, who's forcing them to
do that? Well, who is it? But it's not,

808
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:50,951
the whole thing is,

809
00:46:50,951 --> 00:46:55,620
is do the whole thing's a circus soda
to pick on anybody who's like looking at

810
00:46:55,621 --> 00:46:58,980
the circus and commenting on
the circus as being the problem.

811
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:01,980
That seems to me to be,
that's a little disingenuous.

812
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:04,380
I could see the circus is fine.

813
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:06,570
There's nothing wrong with
like a real housewives show.

814
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,680
It's nothing wrong with it.

815
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,890
And for the people that that can
make money by being observed,

816
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,950
there's nothing wrong with them either.
If they're providing entertainment,

817
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,020
whether we want to think of it
as traditional entertainment,

818
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:20,340
like a guy who writes a book of cartoons
or art or music or anything like that,

819
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:24,330
it's still entertainment.
It might not be good in your sense,

820
00:47:24,331 --> 00:47:25,500
but neither is burger king.

821
00:47:25,501 --> 00:47:28,350
We don't want to put Burger King on
trial cause their cheeseburgers suck

822
00:47:28,351 --> 00:47:29,950
compared to in and out.
You know

823
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,170
it's, we should, we should.

824
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:37,090
But I find it fascinating and Co and
it's weird that people who focus on the

825
00:47:37,091 --> 00:47:42,010
circus or the people that are somehow
low lives, it's weird. Isn't that weird?

826
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:46,690
Oh yeah. Oh you're talking to Jamie.
All of you talk about it all morning.

827
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:49,960
He's been talking about Rob Schneider
getting burglarized all morning.

828
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:54,850
He got burglarized. Yeah. It's $175,000
Willie Mays baseball card was stolen.

829
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,410
So what they did is they, they knew he
was in Montreal. Whoever did it, you know,

830
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:03,100
for the comedy festival, he's down.
They just robbed him blind. That sucks.

831
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:07,030
That's Ugh. That's a big baseball
card. Like in baseball card world,

832
00:48:07,031 --> 00:48:08,600
that's like almost, you know, so they,

833
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:12,310
they specifically targeted that
baseball card. Huh? Prop that.

834
00:48:12,311 --> 00:48:16,280
Or they just targeted him because
they knew he was in Montreal. Wow.

835
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:17,350
Drop Cam people.

836
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:22,380
Everyone needs job fucking baseball card
thing is weird that a piece of paper

837
00:48:22,481 --> 00:48:24,850
from the 1950s could be worth so much.

838
00:48:25,090 --> 00:48:29,410
It's so strange to me because I
understand save you a big Willie Mays fan.

839
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,070
I understand that you'll have like some
youtube clips that you like to watch or

840
00:48:33,071 --> 00:48:33,281
you know,

841
00:48:33,281 --> 00:48:36,250
you watch a documentary on him or
something and it's amazing for you cause

842
00:48:36,251 --> 00:48:40,460
you're a fan. But I can't imagine
giving a fuck about his baseball card.

843
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:42,400
I mean,
I really can't imagine.

844
00:48:42,401 --> 00:48:45,340
I can't imagine buying a baseball
card for a guy who alive.

845
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:49,090
Forget about a guy who I get to
the beach ball. Here's true bro.

846
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:52,000
But the videos or the baseball history,
you fucking idiot.

847
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:54,070
Like you don't have to have
baseball cards anymore.

848
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,300
The baseball cards were only cool
when people didn't have movies. Okay.

849
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:02,800
That's a baseball card. Printers. Yeah,
they did. It was like hard to get one.

850
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:07,510
You couldn't just scan the image and make
your own baseball card. You asshole. No,

851
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:09,370
you don't understand a piece of history.

852
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,400
If I go over to someone's house and
they point to a comic book and go,

853
00:49:12,401 --> 00:49:17,020
this was the original of Spiderman one
is just spreading written one of one,

854
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:18,760
it's worth $50,000 I'm like,

855
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:21,520
well you're retarded because if
you ever open that magazine up,

856
00:49:21,550 --> 00:49:24,820
it looks like shit. Cause the car
to the drawings look like shit.

857
00:49:24,970 --> 00:49:28,750
The artwork sucks. It's not that good.
Like you know you can get it online.

858
00:49:28,751 --> 00:49:31,030
You know you can get online,
you can watch it on your iPad.

859
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:35,260
You fucking idiot get a second print like
well you have to have it in your hand.

860
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:37,220
It has to be old as fuck. Right. It's the,

861
00:49:37,221 --> 00:49:39,670
it's a better version of it
and you can get it on your,

862
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:41,110
I think you can get it on your iPad.

863
00:49:41,111 --> 00:49:43,900
I'm sure he can probably get it on your
iPhone and it doesn't smell like an

864
00:49:43,901 --> 00:49:48,400
antique bookstore.
Grandmother's closet. A smell.

865
00:49:48,401 --> 00:49:52,570
That's actually better than smell
like your grandma's closet. Oh look,

866
00:49:52,571 --> 00:49:56,020
it's in that fucking plastic
back. Meanwhile, I do miss
my comic book collection.

867
00:49:56,021 --> 00:49:56,690
I do too.

868
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:59,830
That's one of the things I sold when I
was poor that I do regret and I could

869
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:02,320
never get it back if I just hung in there.

870
00:50:02,321 --> 00:50:06,250
If I was just a little bit more ambitious
early on and made enough money so I

871
00:50:06,251 --> 00:50:07,960
didn't have to roll pennies for food,

872
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,900
I fucking didn't have to sell
that because I didn't make much.

873
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,490
I saved those comic books.

874
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:16,360
I sold them when I was 21 and I
saved them from the time I was.

875
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:21,280
I think I started when I was like seven
or eight maybe too made me sad. Dude.

876
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:24,850
Threw him though. Like you would know
it. Read them. No, no I wouldn't.

877
00:50:24,851 --> 00:50:28,040
Why would you want them? I don't
know. I don't know. Me just pulling

878
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,340
out and like, that's like memories, like
I'll go back, oh, I forgot about new moon.

879
00:50:32,341 --> 00:50:34,370
It's really a waste of time
pulled up on your iPad.

880
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:37,730
Yup, you're right. It's really kind
of a waste of time and a lot of ways.

881
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:41,180
You know what really made me
super happy, creepy. First of all,

882
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:44,360
this is how cool David
Cho is. Okay. David Show,

883
00:50:44,361 --> 00:50:47,240
when he did the podcast the
first time, um, you know,

884
00:50:47,241 --> 00:50:48,650
I'd heard about him from Bordain.

885
00:50:48,651 --> 00:50:51,770
Bordain told me gotta have mom's catch
crazy and I said, I would love to.

886
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:55,850
I meet him on right away. I just, this
warmth, I'm like this, I love this guy.

887
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:00,870
Like Bing right away. I, come on,
let's talk. And he gave me, he,

888
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,810
we talked about like,
uh,

889
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:08,530
like horror comics and hard illustrations
and Werewolf's and stuff and he gave

890
00:51:09,111 --> 00:51:11,330
me a series of the,
that I had,

891
00:51:11,331 --> 00:51:16,331
I didn't have of these old school like
1950s and sixties and seventies comic

892
00:51:17,031 --> 00:51:19,850
books from like that era
that they had printed,

893
00:51:19,851 --> 00:51:23,900
they'd recreated and printed in book
four and hardback book form is amazing.

894
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:27,860
And he drew that picture that's
outside in the front. I'm like, who's,

895
00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:32,030
who's that cool? Who does that for you?
Who gives you a gift and a piece of art,

896
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:35,630
you know, I mean David Cho is
the coolest motherfucker ever,

897
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:40,220
but the fact that this book was printed,
I love cars.

898
00:51:40,221 --> 00:51:44,420
I love that I could go through this hard
back book and look at these comic books

899
00:51:44,421 --> 00:51:47,240
that I used to.
I used to love those when I was a kid,

900
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:51,680
like a creepy and
ereader and all those uh,

901
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,300
black and white illustrated horror
comic books. They were awesome.

902
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:58,660
I couldn't wait for the new
ones to come out, man. They,

903
00:51:58,661 --> 00:52:02,180
they were everything when I was a kid.
Those things were amazing.

904
00:52:02,181 --> 00:52:04,610
So the fact that you can get
those today on your Ipad,

905
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:05,900
I don't know if he can get those,

906
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:09,380
but you know, you're not
getting the advertisements.
You're not getting like that.

907
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:12,680
The Spanish fly advertisements in
the comic books they used to have,

908
00:52:12,681 --> 00:52:17,000
where are they? A X ray x Ray
classes. Cosby specials. Yeah.

909
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:20,470
You couldn't get anything. Yeah. You
could only get, you couldn't get the,

910
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:24,130
the knowledge that the thing
was actually from that time,

911
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:25,960
like that corvette that I have.

912
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:32,680
One thing I love about that car is it
that car that's a 1965 car of cars from

913
00:52:32,681 --> 00:52:34,240
1965 you know,

914
00:52:34,241 --> 00:52:37,420
it's been a bunch of stuff's been done
to it to make it like handled better.

915
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:42,670
But that's a 1965 is for car is
two years older than me is weird.

916
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:44,613
It's weird.

917
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:48,280
It's weird to have this time capsule
something and to think that this thing was

918
00:52:48,281 --> 00:52:53,020
designed and implemented and created and
sold before you were even a thought in

919
00:52:53,021 --> 00:52:54,040
your dad's Dick

920
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:58,530
that's been fucked in by other people
in the past. Ghost fuckers, man.

921
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,480
You don't 37 mini p 37
million people used.

922
00:53:03,481 --> 00:53:07,530
Ashley Madison and I heard
about that and it got hacked.

923
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:10,470
They tried to advertise for the
podcast and I was like, Ooh,

924
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:16,050
I think you're on your own. I was like,
I don't think this is the way to go.

925
00:53:16,470 --> 00:53:17,940
And what's interesting about the whole,

926
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,030
the whole thing is that people are
freaking out already. You know,

927
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:25,110
people that have used the site, so they're
having fake lists go out of like, uh,

928
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:29,670
like reddit had a fake list the other
day of supposedly that the list has been

929
00:53:29,671 --> 00:53:31,760
released.
And so what,

930
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:34,860
which is a great idea because then you
don't really know which is the real list,

931
00:53:34,861 --> 00:53:35,850
which is the fake list.

932
00:53:35,851 --> 00:53:39,870
It just storing credit cards from
target or is it just information,

933
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:42,440
just information that you brought
that up because I watched it,

934
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,190
commander were on the plane the
other day and I tweeted about it.

935
00:53:45,191 --> 00:53:46,780
It was fucking amazing.

936
00:53:46,781 --> 00:53:51,781
And it was a documentary that everybody
that believes in like really wacky shit

937
00:53:52,091 --> 00:53:57,040
about the Ufo world and you
know art bell type Shit. Yeah.

938
00:53:57,130 --> 00:54:01,120
Mirage man. You got to watch
that. You have to watch that.

939
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:05,170
And it doesn't conclusively prove in
any way that you, fos aren't real,

940
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:07,210
but it's,

941
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:12,270
it sheds a lot of light on
a lot of ridiculous ideas
that people have about Ufo

942
00:54:12,301 --> 00:54:17,301
is that they have accepted as fact and
documents that they point to as fact.

943
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:21,970
It's amazing. It's a good documentary
man. I watched it twice already.

944
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:23,800
I watched it.
And it may,

945
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:27,940
it literally made me watch it again so I
could get a better gist of exactly what

946
00:54:27,941 --> 00:54:29,380
was going on in the documentary.

947
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:32,680
But it's about this guy named
Richard Doty and this guy,

948
00:54:32,681 --> 00:54:35,350
but you Doty was a,
uh,

949
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:39,790
he was a dis information agent for the,
for the government.

950
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:43,450
So when someone would take a photo of
some experimental craft that they're

951
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:44,293
working on,

952
00:54:44,530 --> 00:54:48,580
this guy would find out about it and he
would contact them from the government

953
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:53,610
and provide and tell them that he wanted
to see the photos and that because that

954
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:57,460
they were aware, he would introduce
them to some other information,

955
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,310
but on the grounds that they
keep their mouth shut about this.

956
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:05,730
And so he would tell them like that human
beings are engineered from monkeys and

957
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:10,720
aliens came down and we have the evidence
and they're the reason why we created

958
00:55:10,721 --> 00:55:13,510
the transistor and all
this different crazy shit.

959
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:18,130
And he would talk about Roswell and the
airplanes that crashed and show them

960
00:55:18,131 --> 00:55:22,360
fake pictures of autopsies and say,
I will show you this data.

961
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:27,340
But under two for two, there's going to
be two rules. One, you can't tell anyone.

962
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:29,380
And two,
you can't record any of this.

963
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:33,130
So he would give them this stuff
and show them and say, you,

964
00:55:33,131 --> 00:55:37,810
we need you to fight against this
incoming invasion of aliens and whatever.

965
00:55:37,811 --> 00:55:39,880
Just information he felt
like doing at the time.

966
00:55:39,881 --> 00:55:44,140
Whatever wacky shit this dude felt like
making up. And it was totally into his,

967
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:45,063
his discretion.

968
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:49,000
So this guy would do this and then one
of the things he would do is go to these

969
00:55:49,001 --> 00:55:53,710
Ufo conferences where they would repeat
the shit that he made up and he's in the

970
00:55:53,711 --> 00:55:57,570
back room like this during the
video and he's in the back room,

971
00:55:57,610 --> 00:56:00,100
this Ufo conference at the
Flamingo in Vegas like this.

972
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:03,730
And he's clapping while these people,

973
00:56:03,731 --> 00:56:08,731
these poor fucks who have dedicated
their entire lives to proving they know.

974
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:10,991
Do you understand that?

975
00:56:10,991 --> 00:56:15,460
They know they have been in contact with
an official United States government

976
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,660
agent who is told them there was an
imminent invasion and these people fucking

977
00:56:19,661 --> 00:56:21,670
believe it. So they're traveling
all over the country. They live in,

978
00:56:21,671 --> 00:56:24,000
in the backseat of their,
and they're,

979
00:56:24,001 --> 00:56:27,520
they're basically these people that
are pushed to the brink of suicide that

980
00:56:27,521 --> 00:56:31,840
believe without a doubt that they are in
contact with a fucking government agent.

981
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:35,260
And one of the guys winds up doing that
winds up. I think he killed himself.

982
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,530
I got to go, what the
fuck? I can't remember.

983
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:42,040
Cause he was a guy that was,
they were bringing him to um,

984
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,070
they were bringing them
to psychiatric clinics.

985
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,490
They thought he was completely losing
his mind and he was the guy fucking

986
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,840
African.
I fucking died.

987
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:54,310
He was a guy that was absolutely convinced
that the United States government was

988
00:56:54,311 --> 00:56:59,311
providing him with real information and
that no one was aware of this thing that

989
00:56:59,411 --> 00:57:02,830
he had to tell them about that we are
being monitored there. They're coming,

990
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:06,640
they're going to take us back. We are
androids like, oh, it's wacky shit.

991
00:57:06,641 --> 00:57:08,800
This dude was telling him and this
guy would sit in the back of the room.

992
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:14,050
The guy who told them was just
the ultimate puppet master.

993
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:16,840
It's amazing man.
The Da.

994
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:20,740
The documentary is amazing because the
guy has a smirk on his face the entire

995
00:57:20,741 --> 00:57:25,741
time he's talking about it and you
realize this crazy fucker just created the

996
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:30,430
like a giant percentage
of the whole UFO folklore.

997
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:35,110
It all came from this one crazy fucker
and this one organization and there's

998
00:57:35,111 --> 00:57:37,000
another guy on it too as a younger guy.

999
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:40,540
Seems like he's got his shit together
and he's talking about, you know,

1000
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:43,210
there's alien beings from,
you know,

1001
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:46,930
thousand light years away or whatever
the fuck he's talking about it and he's

1002
00:57:46,931 --> 00:57:50,200
another admitted government agent
and he's talking about, I'm like,

1003
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:52,330
well you're doing it now.
You're doing it now.

1004
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:55,570
You're doing it now cause you must be
doing it now. If you're not doing it now.

1005
00:57:55,571 --> 00:57:59,950
You'd have some pictures and videos and
some stuff to show us like you sang that

1006
00:57:59,951 --> 00:58:01,630
there's,
how do you know that there's some,

1007
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:04,240
you don't just say
there's a fucking planet.

1008
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:09,330
I know because I have access to very
secretive government information that lets

1009
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,830
me know you can't just
do that. No, you have to.

1010
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:15,370
That's how the whole science thing works.
As far as it's been explained to me.

1011
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:19,720
You have to exactly show, you have
to bring data. You have to have,

1012
00:58:19,721 --> 00:58:21,550
there's has to be something
before you say that.

1013
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:25,090
Otherwise people aren't going to
listen to you. Well, who told you, oh,

1014
00:58:25,091 --> 00:58:27,580
that guy told you his name is
Richard Doty. Oh, that guy.

1015
00:58:27,581 --> 00:58:30,880
I'm going to show you a video about that
guy, that guy talking about what he did.

1016
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:36,070
You goofy fuck. What's it called
again? It's called Mirage. Men Mirage,

1017
00:58:36,071 --> 00:58:40,760
man. It's, it's, it's amazing.
It's amazing. It's, it's,

1018
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:45,070
it's really almost a psychological
documentary than it is a documentary about

1019
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:47,890
Ufos.
Cause it's the thing that I,

1020
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:52,480
I'm recognized in myself
when I had wacky beliefs.

1021
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:55,690
I still have a bunch of wacky beliefs.
I'm not saying I'm immune to them,

1022
00:58:55,691 --> 00:58:59,390
but one of the things that I recognized
in myself and why I, you know,

1023
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:02,830
believed in like, um, uh,

1024
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:06,400
you remember those things that were a
raw, right. Remember those rods things.

1025
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:11,230
Oh my God, I watched a
video. Any Pravo. He and I,

1026
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:14,350
we that you know, the man that
remember that Alien Fish Bong I had,

1027
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:17,950
I still have it. Um, but we,

1028
00:59:17,951 --> 00:59:22,951
we filled that alien fish bong up with
a God's creation and we watched this

1029
00:59:23,121 --> 00:59:27,500
stupid fucking VHS tape of an artifact.

1030
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:31,280
The artifact is when bugs
fly really close to a camera,

1031
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:33,050
their wings move so fast.

1032
00:59:33,050 --> 00:59:36,960
The video camera's Lens can't quite
capture it correctly. And Jamie,

1033
00:59:36,961 --> 00:59:38,300
you're a professional photographer.

1034
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:40,970
He could explain what's
going on with that aperture.

1035
00:59:40,971 --> 00:59:44,810
F like the frames per second with the
video faster moving too fast to capture

1036
00:59:44,811 --> 00:59:47,600
the light.
So what it does in the images,

1037
00:59:47,601 --> 00:59:50,750
CV pull video up cause
it's glorious what it does.

1038
00:59:50,751 --> 00:59:54,440
And the image that I was
fucking convinced, okay,

1039
00:59:54,441 --> 00:59:58,220
I was convinced to the DNA.
I knew these things were around us.

1040
00:59:58,221 --> 01:00:01,640
We just couldn't perceive them and say
that's the lane. What was the other thing?

1041
01:00:01,641 --> 01:00:04,370
That lens flare one where like do you take
a picture and there's like, oh my God,

1042
01:00:04,371 --> 01:00:07,010
there's a ghost and these orbs,
orbs,

1043
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:09,710
orbs.

1044
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:13,580
But no one ever captured
until they figured out digital
cameras and he's still,

1045
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:18,240
Eddie still believes that right orbit.
He's got some proof. He's gets improved.

1046
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,410
That backs up his,
cause.

1047
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,260
I remember Eddie was the one that
was really into the orbs. Eddie,

1048
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,730
he loves everything.
Well like, like Eddie,

1049
01:00:25,731 --> 01:00:27,830
I didn't have the best childhood but mine,

1050
01:00:27,831 --> 01:00:30,150
I think it was better than his until I,
uh,

1051
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:33,800
I want to believe in mystical bullshit,
magic things.

1052
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:35,390
I think there's a big part of us.

1053
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:40,840
I think the reason why
people like thinking about
bigfoot over killer whales is

1054
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:44,840
only because we don't know for sure if
big foot existed at big foot definitely

1055
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:47,420
existed. He's way closer to
us than a killer whale is.

1056
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:50,610
Killer whales would be amazing
if they didn't exist. We,

1057
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:54,020
if someone told you that there was some
intelligent life form that was like a

1058
01:00:54,021 --> 01:00:57,650
fish, but it was also, it was
also a, a mammal in some way.

1059
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:02,270
This is those stupid things. The Sky,
they're calling it sky fish flying rods.

1060
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,430
And it's just the,
um,

1061
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:09,350
it's an artifact of these cameras
not being able to pick up on the bug

1062
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:14,390
correctly. So as the bug moves across the
screen, it looks like an elongated rod.

1063
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,210
What's really stupid about it,
and I didn't think about it at the time,

1064
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:21,590
is that if it really was moving that fast,

1065
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:26,540
like as you see it in this video,
you'd be able to see it like I see it.

1066
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:31,250
Yeah. You know what I'm saying? I
mean, when they do it in high speed,

1067
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:36,320
some of them you can see and when they
slow it down and they become these rods,

1068
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:39,710
that's the only time where
they look like a Rod.

1069
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:41,420
It's when it slowed down
and you speed it up.

1070
01:01:41,421 --> 01:01:44,000
It looks like a bug because it
is a fucking bug. God dammit.

1071
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:46,160
Like you could almost
figured it out watching him,

1072
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:50,780
but one dude got really nutty and
attached to the idea and produce these

1073
01:01:50,781 --> 01:01:54,260
documentaries about an artifact.
And then see,

1074
01:01:54,261 --> 01:01:55,850
look at that one flying
across the fucking,

1075
01:01:55,851 --> 01:01:57,740
this is a hole in the ground in Mexico.

1076
01:01:58,010 --> 01:01:59,990
And as these guys or sky
diving into this whole,

1077
01:01:59,991 --> 01:02:03,200
it's whole goes like a mile into the
ground. It's like an underground cave.

1078
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,330
This dude filmed,

1079
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:10,070
these people dive in into this hole
and these rods all around them.

1080
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:14,810
But there's, if you put it on a high
speed camera camera that captures many,

1081
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:19,650
many frames per second, like those red
cameras or any of those like digital, um,

1082
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,100
prod cast quality cameras, then you
don't see it. You just see bugs.

1083
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:27,300
So they figured it out on that show.
Monster Quest,

1084
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:32,020
like they showed back to back footage.
They have two cameras over a firehouse, a,

1085
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:33,900
um, a, a campfire,

1086
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:37,260
and the two f the f
campfire attracted bugs.

1087
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:41,130
So as the two cameras filmed at, one of
them was high speed, one of was standard.

1088
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:43,410
The standard ones showed
all these fucking process.

1089
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:47,530
The high speed one showed bugs.
So they're funny.

1090
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:52,590
I fucking believed it, man. Dude, I
believe different months, I don't know,

1091
01:02:52,591 --> 01:02:57,150
it might've been a year. It might've been
a year and a half. You see the video,

1092
01:02:57,151 --> 01:03:00,790
that giant squid that the Russian
sailor's found like this ray Eric. Yeah.

1093
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:05,500
But that's real. I know. I didn't know
they got that big dog get newsman.

1094
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:08,640
No, they get absolutely enormous. Well,

1095
01:03:08,641 --> 01:03:12,900
here's a fascinating thing about the giant
squid is that until like a decade ago,

1096
01:03:12,901 --> 01:03:16,140
it was just a legend.
Like no one had any idea

1097
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:21,480
that I don't think they'll be dick
and stuff was about right. Like, well,

1098
01:03:21,481 --> 01:03:25,710
not exactly, but it's about a
version of it. And matter of fact,

1099
01:03:25,711 --> 01:03:29,310
they found these fossil
remains, um, not remains,

1100
01:03:29,311 --> 01:03:32,650
but these fossils of imprints from a,

1101
01:03:32,651 --> 01:03:37,651
a dead being suction cups and they believe
it's evidence of something that would

1102
01:03:38,071 --> 01:03:42,480
have been referred to as the cracking.
She, the thing about the ocean, okay.

1103
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:45,900
One of the things about these ocean
animals as far as it's been as it's been

1104
01:03:45,901 --> 01:03:47,730
explained to me, is that, uh,

1105
01:03:47,731 --> 01:03:51,620
the issue with trying to figure out
how long things have been around this,

1106
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:55,830
first of all, it's too big
to explore. You're dealing
with this enormous, enormous,

1107
01:03:55,831 --> 01:03:59,130
enormous, enormous, see
several bodies of water,

1108
01:03:59,131 --> 01:04:02,730
but all of them are just way too big
for you to call him 100% of the water.

1109
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:07,530
Then you've got to think about the fact
that all these beings look at this crazy

1110
01:04:07,531 --> 01:04:11,910
giant squid you sings are so big. Do
you see the one pull the one up? Ah,

1111
01:04:11,950 --> 01:04:13,250
that was taken by,
um,

1112
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:18,350
I believe it was an Exxon oil rig and
it was a crab alien looking thing.

1113
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,280
But my point being,

1114
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:24,240
all these beings they're made at their
bodies are made out of flesh and their

1115
01:04:24,241 --> 01:04:28,980
bones are made out of like a Cartlidge
except for their skulls and their spines.

1116
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,810
But all they have is like
this, these, you know these,

1117
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:34,430
you've eaten fish bones before.
We've all gotten like fish. No,

1118
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,570
we've all gotten like fish.
Like give it a salmon filet.

1119
01:04:36,571 --> 01:04:39,870
You get a rib in your mouth.
It's like a delicate little thing.

1120
01:04:39,871 --> 01:04:42,570
It's not like you're eating a bone.
I mean he'd call it a bone,

1121
01:04:42,571 --> 01:04:43,560
but it's like a different thing.

1122
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:47,790
Everything at the bottom of the ocean
eats that shit out of that. That's gone.

1123
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:53,070
So like to know how, yeah, that's
the thing. That's the a this is that.

1124
01:04:53,530 --> 01:04:58,050
Um, they didn't know. They have never seen
this thing before until 2007 they had,

1125
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,730
they had even know this thing existed.

1126
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:04,950
It's got like these bendy crab arms
that come off the back of a giant squid.

1127
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,860
It's like a Dali painting,
right? [inaudible] it's so great.

1128
01:05:07,861 --> 01:05:11,460
Pull it to the beginning again
and just pause it when they,

1129
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:15,390
when they zoom it out, you're like, what?
This is c'mon man. Pause that. Pause that.

1130
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:19,660
If they found that flying space,
you'd be shitting your pants.

1131
01:05:20,020 --> 01:05:23,500
If they took the space shuttle up into
the atmosphere and they found that

1132
01:05:23,501 --> 01:05:28,150
hovering above the earth,
we would be shitting our fucking pants.

1133
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:31,120
But the fact that this creepy thing,

1134
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:35,620
this creepy bat wing looking spider
crab thing as living in the ocean,

1135
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:38,950
we don't care. It's so
weird. Isn't this bizarre?

1136
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:44,290
People go on the ocean, they go in
the ocean, the alien movie, right?

1137
01:05:44,291 --> 01:05:47,170
That's an alien movie.
100% things crazy,

1138
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:50,590
but the point is that those things
are all there. They're all flesh.

1139
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:54,330
It's almost all flesh except
for a beak like octopuses.

1140
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:57,970
They're all flesh except for their beak.
So when you get down to it,

1141
01:05:57,971 --> 01:06:01,780
when they die, they just, they're
gone. They just get eaten by the,

1142
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:04,750
it's really an efficient way.
You don't need bones.

1143
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,730
Like we need bones in the water.

1144
01:06:06,731 --> 01:06:11,290
You need to be strong and pliable and
to be able to regenerate your limbs like

1145
01:06:11,291 --> 01:06:13,450
that seems to be a way
better idea than bones.

1146
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:17,110
So octa can octopus regenerate
their limbs? Am I talking shit?

1147
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:21,400
Can they have no idea? Hmm.
I need to find that out.

1148
01:06:21,670 --> 01:06:24,730
But the point is that we don't
know how big they used to get.

1149
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:28,540
And so they found this fossil that
indicates that there's this huge fucking

1150
01:06:28,541 --> 01:06:33,340
suction cups. Enormous. So they think
it was this crazy fucking octopus.

1151
01:06:33,341 --> 01:06:37,480
They might've been a hundred feet
long. How octopus arms regenerate? Bam.

1152
01:06:37,481 --> 01:06:41,620
See with ease, pitch, trust in
your thoughts, not the weed.

1153
01:06:43,010 --> 01:06:47,500
We just submit it to your memory. Yeah,
they do grow back. Pull up that thing.

1154
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:52,030
It could exist. They don't
know. Pull up that thing. Real
life cracking. Discovered.

1155
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:55,540
Pull up the, uh, the images
that they've found of this, uh,

1156
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:58,840
these enormous suction cups
that were fossil suction cups.

1157
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,500
And they were thinking about there.
Okay. This cause they, they figured out,

1158
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:04,210
I forget what year it was.

1159
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:08,830
I don't think it was much earlier than
like 2000 where they found out that giant

1160
01:07:08,831 --> 01:07:11,560
squids were real. I matter of fact,
I'm being conservative I think,

1161
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:16,030
but I think that um, up until then it was
just a mystery, like a myth, like the,

1162
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:20,380
the idea of a giant squid. And then
once they found them they went, oh shit,

1163
01:07:20,381 --> 01:07:25,180
these are real. Okay.
So this is super recent.

1164
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:29,740
Well this fossil, see that fossil up
there above the top, the top on there,

1165
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:33,790
that's tentacles and
they're fucking enormous.

1166
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:37,620
They're enormous.
Okay.

1167
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:41,710
This shitty formatted
website and it gets too big.

1168
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:45,220
Your Facebook stupid buttons
and Pinterest and Twitter.

1169
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,700
I'll get in the way of the images,
the new discovery of fossils,

1170
01:07:48,701 --> 01:07:49,540
including the shell,

1171
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:54,190
like fossil belief to belong to an ancient
octopus type creature, blah, blah, blah,

1172
01:07:54,191 --> 01:07:55,060
blah,
blah.

1173
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:59,440
It supported the 2011 theory about
the existence of the cracking.

1174
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:07,270
Can imagine if they did send one of
those fucking little James Cameron type,

1175
01:08:07,271 --> 01:08:10,660
individual billionaire dudes,
sub remains down there.

1176
01:08:10,661 --> 01:08:14,560
And he discovered a fucking 900 foot long

1177
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:24,340
had just decided to eat that stupid
Tylenol capsule sized personal watercraft

1178
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,320
that Mr. Cameron floats around in
85 and eight did he find anything?

1179
01:08:31,360 --> 01:08:34,310
Now he's the fucking guy who has gone
deeper than any human that's ever lived.

1180
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:37,820
Do you understand this? That's how, what
a bad mother fucker James Cameron is.

1181
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:38,833
He's the guy.

1182
01:08:38,940 --> 01:08:41,980
Yeah. Why isn't there a NASA
for our own earth? You know

1183
01:08:43,710 --> 01:08:48,710
like why don't we just go down there like
probably cheaper than like zillions of

1184
01:08:50,071 --> 01:08:53,670
dollars go in this space and we'll
probably figure out that like there's

1185
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:56,010
something that's down there that's
like, okay, you guys want to know?

1186
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:59,850
Like they could communicate with us and
tell us everything we want to know and

1187
01:08:59,851 --> 01:09:04,350
like, oh no. Some underwater door. See
that's, that's getting pushed it too far.

1188
01:09:04,490 --> 01:09:08,120
Here's my terrifying fear. Here's my
terrifying fear about all that shit.

1189
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:13,640
My terrifying fear is that human beings
are the smartest things in the universe.

1190
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:17,360
You think? Yeah, for sure. I'm,
no, no, definitely not for sure.

1191
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:19,040
I don't even know for sure if I'm real.

1192
01:09:19,670 --> 01:09:22,930
I don't even know for sure if this isn't
some crazy dream or a video game where

1193
01:09:22,931 --> 01:09:26,840
all we're all planning. I'm
not sure. I'm not sure 100%,

1194
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:28,820
but I'm not sure.

1195
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:33,370
I just think that if you look at life,
Eh,

1196
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:36,860
from, from an outside perspective, you
try to pay attention to what this is,

1197
01:09:36,861 --> 01:09:40,850
what this is for you. What is life did
define to me? What is life to you Brian?

1198
01:09:40,851 --> 01:09:42,710
Red Band, what's his
life to me? What is life?

1199
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:46,690
Ah,
ah,

1200
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:49,520
I think it's something that uh,

1201
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:53,260
we're all programmed to do and it's
not gonna make sense until it's over,

1202
01:09:53,350 --> 01:09:56,290
but I think it's definitely
something that that's,

1203
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:02,760
that's that word doing because
based off of something else,

1204
01:10:03,390 --> 01:10:06,780
like I saw something like I think
like I was born to, you know, like,

1205
01:10:06,790 --> 01:10:08,500
like you said earlier we
were talking about earlier,

1206
01:10:08,501 --> 01:10:11,410
like a cat finding the cat litter box.
If for some reason it knows,

1207
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:14,440
I think every single person is born to do,

1208
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:19,590
like they're already born in programmed
in a way to make it sound like something

1209
01:10:20,171 --> 01:10:22,800
we can relate to like a,
like a,

1210
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:25,210
a phone or something like
that or an operating system.

1211
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:28,750
We are programmed also to do,
to live a certain way,

1212
01:10:28,751 --> 01:10:31,760
to do a certain way to
think a certain way to uh,

1213
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,800
have a certain talent or something that
you're drawn to. But I think we're all,

1214
01:10:35,801 --> 01:10:40,570
it's already been mapped out for the
most part too, to a point. Jamie,

1215
01:10:40,571 --> 01:10:45,400
do you agree with that? Uh, yeah,
to a certain extent. I mean,

1216
01:10:45,401 --> 01:10:50,010
I think you're drawn
places for sure. Um, but I,

1217
01:10:50,011 --> 01:10:53,070
I don't know that, I don't know, cause
I've had certain things pop up my,

1218
01:10:53,071 --> 01:10:56,020
my life where I've, like, I thought
I still, I'm going to do forever.

1219
01:10:56,380 --> 01:10:57,820
I'm playing sports forever,
you know?

1220
01:10:57,821 --> 01:11:01,240
But that isn't that just something
that's cool that comes into your life and

1221
01:11:01,241 --> 01:11:04,930
interests, maybe a hobby, I don't know.
Something that gives you like a new buzz.

1222
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:09,640
Uh, yeah. I guess if I look
at it, the kind of all similar
though, creating stuff,

1223
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:14,130
there's been, yeah, you're, you're more
drawn towards the arts and creating

1224
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:16,770
where other people, you
know, John Towards numbers,

1225
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:21,210
other people are drawn to dancing.
You know, I, I, I think it's,

1226
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:26,860
well, I think I, when you die, it's
definitely going to be like, ah, yeah,

1227
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:30,630
kind of thing. Double. That's what
psychedelics feel like, right?

1228
01:11:30,660 --> 01:11:33,990
When you have like a crazy breakthrough
psychedelic moment where, you know,

1229
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:35,820
write the fucking universe fades on you.

1230
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:38,310
[inaudible] one of the things
that you think is like, oh,

1231
01:11:38,311 --> 01:11:42,090
this is always been here. Yeah, I
remember this. Yeah. Yeah. This is here.

1232
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:43,730
This is always here.

1233
01:11:43,730 --> 01:11:45,790
I think that's going to
happen again. And then, uh,

1234
01:11:45,791 --> 01:11:48,490
our soul's going to under the ocean.
We're all going to become

1235
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:51,363
dolphins or something.

1236
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:56,740
I just find it amazing how little we
know about shit that just happened.

1237
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:01,540
I find it amazing that they're always
finding is these new pieces of information

1238
01:12:01,541 --> 01:12:05,260
that change things like this crack
him thing or about like this, uh,

1239
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:09,370
they found some new evidence of
agriculture this 23,000 years old,

1240
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:11,740
23,000 years old wheat growing,

1241
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:16,390
and then that pushes civilization
back like some insane number.

1242
01:12:16,391 --> 01:12:17,740
I don't know what the original number was,

1243
01:12:17,741 --> 01:12:21,430
but I don't think it was less than
10 or more than 10,000 years ago.

1244
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:25,240
So it went 13,000 years further,
at least.

1245
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:28,630
At least where they found evidence of it,
you know,

1246
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:33,460
who knows how much evidence there is of
shit. It's just gone. It doesn't exist.

1247
01:12:33,461 --> 01:12:37,790
How does that battery from Iran or Iraq?
That's so cool. Like you're saying. Yeah.

1248
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:40,460
Do you think there's anything in
the future that's controlling us

1249
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:42,750
now? Anything? Right.

1250
01:12:43,020 --> 01:12:46,050
What I was saying earlier is
that I think that my fear is,

1251
01:12:46,051 --> 01:12:49,190
and it's not really a fear because
I think we're pretty awesome. I'm a,

1252
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:52,290
I'm an unabashed,
um,

1253
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:56,490
enthusiast of human beings. I think
human beings are pretty fucking cool.

1254
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,260
I think for sure there's some ones that
are a mess and those ones that are a

1255
01:13:01,261 --> 01:13:02,860
mass they can get,

1256
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,870
they can get into some positions where
they can cause trouble for everybody else.

1257
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:11,640
And part of it's our fault because we
allowed them to have the responsibility of

1258
01:13:11,641 --> 01:13:13,290
managing certain areas.

1259
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:18,360
Like if you look at the human race as a
whole and then you look at some insane

1260
01:13:18,361 --> 01:13:22,470
pollution like you go to, you ever been
to Detroit? Oh yeah. Nice there this year.

1261
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:27,690
Did you go to the river
area? Yeah, I do. Dude, it's
depressing is it? Oh my God, we,

1262
01:13:27,691 --> 01:13:31,350
we filmed there for that Psi Phi show
that I did and when while me and my friend

1263
01:13:31,351 --> 01:13:34,080
Todd, we're driving around this
river, we were like, fuck dude,

1264
01:13:34,530 --> 01:13:38,940
this is awful like that, that God damn
river has been poisoned, you know?

1265
01:13:38,940 --> 01:13:42,150
And everybody kind of knows that it's
one of the most polluted areas in the

1266
01:13:42,151 --> 01:13:46,200
world. I mean, collectively,
I think we all know that,
right? As a, as a, as a race,

1267
01:13:46,201 --> 01:13:49,140
but we don't feel, we're not responsible.
We didn't do it. I didn't do it.

1268
01:13:49,141 --> 01:13:51,240
You didn't do it. So
somebody did it. Well,

1269
01:13:51,241 --> 01:13:54,990
what percentage of the people that
did it did it at a 350 million people?

1270
01:13:54,991 --> 01:13:59,850
What percentage of that population
polluted the Detroit river? It's small.

1271
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:04,320
It's super small, but a small
percentage can start a nuclear war.

1272
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:08,130
A small percentage can cause the
genocide is small. It's small.

1273
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:12,190
But if you let them get away with it,
they can do some fucked up shit.

1274
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:17,350
It's small. But I think
overall, and this is,

1275
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:20,230
and I understand people that
say, oh, people suck. I get it.

1276
01:14:20,231 --> 01:14:21,460
I know what you're trying to say.

1277
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:25,180
I know you're trying to say we can
definitely suck in comparison to the

1278
01:14:25,181 --> 01:14:26,740
potential that we show as well.

1279
01:14:26,830 --> 01:14:29,680
But here's the thing about the
people that tell me that people suck.

1280
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:35,500
They usually don't suck. I
like them like, like they say,

1281
01:14:35,501 --> 01:14:38,740
people suck, man. People fucking suck.
I fucking hate people. And then I go,

1282
01:14:38,741 --> 01:14:41,320
but I like you and you're a person.
I like you.

1283
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:45,640
And you're telling me that people
suck. Like you're nice, you're nice.

1284
01:14:45,641 --> 01:14:49,480
And I'm nice. So how are people, how
do people suck? How is that possible?

1285
01:14:49,481 --> 01:14:53,770
Some people suck, some people. Oh, okay.

1286
01:14:53,771 --> 01:14:57,580
So that's what percentage is that?
Could you imagine if like food,

1287
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:02,910
if like one 1000000th of a percent of
food would give you fucking ridiculous

1288
01:15:04,811 --> 01:15:08,410
diarrhea, but you were
like, fuck food man foods,

1289
01:15:08,411 --> 01:15:11,050
bullshit food causes diarrhea.

1290
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:15,550
Food Causes Cholera and be like, but
no, no, no, no. Most food nourishes you.

1291
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:19,750
Most food takes care of you without most
food. You had died dude, foods bullshit,

1292
01:15:19,751 --> 01:15:23,460
bro. You know in Bangladesh, four year old
boy died from bad food and you're like,

1293
01:15:23,461 --> 01:15:27,730
well, what about the 7 billion people
that ate food and that they stayed alive?

1294
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:32,050
That's to me the same sort of philosophy.
When people say that people suck.

1295
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:35,380
I don't think people suck. I think
people can suck. I think I've sucked.

1296
01:15:35,381 --> 01:15:39,430
I think you suck. You suck all
the time. God dammit. Jamie. Hey,

1297
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:44,830
these mean, I mean this what I mean
like as a potential, like as a,

1298
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:48,160
as a potential.
I think the human race is insane.

1299
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:52,900
I think it's the most amazing thing ever.
We might be the tip of the spear.

1300
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:53,890
We might be.

1301
01:15:54,130 --> 01:15:59,130
It might be that it takes some weird
collection of carbon based life and a,

1302
01:16:00,351 --> 01:16:05,351
a constant environment and biological
entities that need the stun to stay warm.

1303
01:16:06,580 --> 01:16:11,470
It takes a lot of fucking weird shit to
create a person. They navigate Siberia.

1304
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,720
Come across the Bering Strait,
make it in America,

1305
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:18,840
make fucking edges with stones and
attached to the mystics and shoot him with

1306
01:16:19,361 --> 01:16:22,990
bows and arrows at Buffalo. I mean,
you're, you're dealing with a mad,

1307
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:27,820
creative little weird animal.
It's not that easy to get to that point.

1308
01:16:27,821 --> 01:16:31,630
Why not just stay a squid?
Why not?

1309
01:16:31,631 --> 01:16:34,450
Squids had been squids
for 250 million years.

1310
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:37,360
Why not just stay a stupid
fucking hammerhead shark?

1311
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:42,900
Why not stay a fish that needs a dog
to go up to it and splash water on it

1312
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:47,860
because it doesn't have legs like an
asshole. Just walk away. You fucked.

1313
01:16:47,861 --> 01:16:50,530
They can't, they can't walk away
and you can't breathe underwater.

1314
01:16:51,100 --> 01:16:53,830
Why does it create a human being?

1315
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:56,140
It might be a blip in the system.

1316
01:16:56,500 --> 01:17:00,310
It might be the chimps are as good as it
gets anywhere and that all of a sudden

1317
01:17:00,311 --> 01:17:05,311
some weird thing happen and we came
along and we're the fucking top of the

1318
01:17:05,471 --> 01:17:10,130
intelligent ladder, but we
suck. We don't always suck, but

1319
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:13,670
we suck on some occasions. On a lot
of occasions on memorable, memorable,

1320
01:17:13,671 --> 01:17:16,220
measurable occasions we suck.
You know,

1321
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:21,050
we're a species that'll drop bombs on
countries indiscriminately to prove a

1322
01:17:21,051 --> 01:17:24,110
point like we did in World War One
and two. They, I mean worldwide. Sure.

1323
01:17:24,111 --> 01:17:28,970
Whether they ended the war by dropping
nuclear bombs just on a whole city boom.

1324
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:33,710
That sucks, right? Everybody would
say, that sucks. We don't all suck.

1325
01:17:34,460 --> 01:17:35,300
We don't all suck.

1326
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:41,410
I really think that we're in in the the
very end of a strange process on this

1327
01:17:41,601 --> 01:17:46,310
planet. I don't think we're more than a
decade away from being something that's

1328
01:17:46,311 --> 01:17:49,730
completely different than we are now.
I really think that

1329
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:54,300
it's falling apart fast, faster,
and faster. Also, in a weird way,

1330
01:17:54,301 --> 01:17:57,660
man, weird. Our heroes are
now, you know bill Cosby,

1331
01:17:57,690 --> 01:18:01,380
that cover of New York magazine where it
has all the victims that's all lined up.

1332
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:02,070
It's,

1333
01:18:02,070 --> 01:18:05,790
would you say five years ago you said
that bill Cosby was all this was going to

1334
01:18:05,791 --> 01:18:07,740
happen. You're like, you're
crazy. Shut the fuck up. No,

1335
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:10,760
I would've never believed it. And
you know what? Here's the sad thing,

1336
01:18:10,761 --> 01:18:13,760
and this is on me.
I think probably five years ago,

1337
01:18:13,761 --> 01:18:18,590
I'd probably heard something crazy that
he did. Really? I don't, I don't remember.

1338
01:18:18,830 --> 01:18:20,480
I don't remember.
It was five years ago or,

1339
01:18:20,481 --> 01:18:23,720
but there was a trial that it was
in the news 10 years ago apparently.

1340
01:18:23,990 --> 01:18:26,870
And that was the one that he settled out
of court that they took the deposition

1341
01:18:26,871 --> 01:18:31,340
from and they used it in
this, uh, this new thing.

1342
01:18:32,090 --> 01:18:35,690
It's a sad as fuck, man. It's
sad as fuck it says, fuck that.

1343
01:18:35,691 --> 01:18:37,400
A person has been doing
that their whole life.

1344
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:42,500
Trying to find a look at all the girls
that are on that. They want to look at it.

1345
01:18:42,501 --> 01:18:44,360
Man,
I don't want to see the navy had to type,

1346
01:18:44,361 --> 01:18:46,050
it doesn't really look like it just,

1347
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:47,270
it's sad dude.

1348
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:53,150
It's waste solder for them than it is
for him for sure. But it's still sad.

1349
01:18:53,151 --> 01:18:58,010
It's sad all around. It's fucked
up. It's wrong. It's just wrong.

1350
01:18:58,011 --> 01:19:01,490
We all know it's wrong. There's no one
defending that. You can't defend that.

1351
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:03,740
You know? And what's
really interesting, man,

1352
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:07,730
I've been talking about this on stage
about the animal house scene with the

1353
01:19:07,731 --> 01:19:10,400
devil and the angel. I remember
when the devil is like, fuck her.

1354
01:19:10,401 --> 01:19:14,630
Fuck her brains out soccer debts ever.
That you could never do that today.

1355
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:16,610
You could never do that today.

1356
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:21,170
You can never have a scene in
a comedy where a little tiny,

1357
01:19:21,171 --> 01:19:25,340
cute little miniature devil
was telling you a rape. Right?

1358
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:29,300
They're written. There's that
other one though. Uh, what's,
uh, happening? Hot stuff.

1359
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:33,380
Uh, what's that movie where she was passed
out and uh, what's that movie called?

1360
01:19:33,381 --> 01:19:36,260
Do you remember? Jamie?
Hmm. Uh, there was a lot,

1361
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:40,400
there's a lot of movies that have weird
drunk rape type scenes or where they're

1362
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:43,280
passed out or like feeling
their tits up like hot dog.

1363
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:48,360
I probably has a few and meatballs and
all those other eighties perv movies that

1364
01:19:49,851 --> 01:19:51,570
involve Porky's Porky's

1365
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:58,190
hotdog skiing, no hot dogs.
Porky's on skis is a real movie.

1366
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:01,700
There was a gang of those movies. Maybe
this was another one, right? Who did,

1367
01:20:01,701 --> 01:20:03,620
I totally forgot about those movies.

1368
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:07,200
I forgot about Porky's until right
now until you just brought that up.

1369
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:08,130
I probably haven't

1370
01:20:08,130 --> 01:20:09,870
thought about Porky's in 10 years.

1371
01:20:09,871 --> 01:20:13,760
10 solid shower scene where
they're looking through
the shower and just Porky's

1372
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:18,570
was hot. You should never do that today.
That was total creeper rapist shit.

1373
01:20:18,610 --> 01:20:22,020
That's what's, well that's pretty much
what the Seth Rogen movies are now.

1374
01:20:22,110 --> 01:20:26,790
You know, that's their version of
like the, the uh, super bads. Yeah.

1375
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:28,070
They can get away with some stuff.

1376
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:31,300
They can get away with some
stuff as far as like, um, like,

1377
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:34,170
like the drawing of the Dicks I remember

1378
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:38,900
so close to home.
It's so ridiculous.

1379
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:41,750
They can get away with some stuff that
they could have never gotten away with

1380
01:20:41,751 --> 01:20:45,650
back then. But back then they could
get away with the insensitive stuff.

1381
01:20:46,010 --> 01:20:48,710
Like you could never have drawing
dicks and animal house movie.

1382
01:20:48,850 --> 01:20:52,310
We would show the guy drawing all the
dicks. People weren't ready for that.

1383
01:20:52,311 --> 01:20:56,210
Now that is like,
to me in a strange way,

1384
01:20:56,420 --> 01:21:00,980
some sort of evidence of evolution
that's like imprinted in our media.

1385
01:21:01,910 --> 01:21:06,800
Like that seems to me to be the biggest
evidence that human beings are moving

1386
01:21:06,801 --> 01:21:09,200
towards something better than we are now.

1387
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:14,440
Which is one of the reasons why I think
that like why there's so much criticism

1388
01:21:14,690 --> 01:21:18,580
and so much like there's so much
anger and people mad at people today,

1389
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:22,190
like we're even when we were talking
about like people mad at celebrities and

1390
01:21:22,191 --> 01:21:26,390
people mad at Tmz for
following celebrities and
people mad at celebrity shows.

1391
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:27,223
Like there's,

1392
01:21:28,010 --> 01:21:33,010
I think there's got to be at
least somewhere in that anger,

1393
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:35,210
ms misguided as it may be,

1394
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:38,810
this desire for all of us to do better.

1395
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:44,230
And I think it sort of manifests itself
in some kind of a weird dystopia.

1396
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:50,480
It's weird, a vibration of anger
that runs through our culture, but,

1397
01:21:50,660 --> 01:21:53,690
but it's,
it's not like an unsurmountable problem.

1398
01:21:54,360 --> 01:21:57,020
And I think people look at it like
it's an unsurmountable problem.

1399
01:21:57,140 --> 01:22:00,440
But I think like human
beings, like overall, I think,

1400
01:22:00,441 --> 01:22:03,680
like I say the word light
too much about that. I like,

1401
01:22:03,681 --> 01:22:05,990
don't even like what the
fuck I'm like talking about,

1402
01:22:06,530 --> 01:22:09,020
I think human beings overall
are getting way better.

1403
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,150
I think we're getting way better.

1404
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:14,540
So when something like the whole coke and
things or something like that happens,

1405
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:19,000
people get super bummed out
because like fuck not hulk Hogan.

1406
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:24,140
Not Whole Cogan Shit like that.
Dude.

1407
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:28,130
Why does he believe silly shit like live?
She does believe silly shit.

1408
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:29,720
Maybe he doesn't believe it anymore.

1409
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:31,940
What am I go Jackson
things totally different.

1410
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:38,090
Cause it's not just a thought.
It's an action allegedly. Right.

1411
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:41,070
Well it's still theory. It's
awesome to the point of, you know,

1412
01:22:41,071 --> 01:22:43,500
we grew up Michael Jackson.
How was the king now? He,

1413
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:47,490
that was the coolest person ever. And
watch him deteriorate over the last years.

1414
01:22:47,491 --> 01:22:51,090
And then all the, I, you know, with all
this Cosby shit and all the kids stuff,

1415
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:53,460
if Michael Jackson was still alive,
he would be the next Cosby.

1416
01:22:53,490 --> 01:22:56,250
We would find out that all
these kids, like even, you know,

1417
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:59,610
Corey Haim would come out and say, Oh
yeah, he fucked me good. And you know,

1418
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:04,680
Shit like that, right?
Damn. Don't you think so?

1419
01:23:05,140 --> 01:23:06,150
I don't know.
I mean

1420
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:07,680
if they could take down cause speed,

1421
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:11,050
they can definitely get to
Michael could be or it could be.

1422
01:23:11,051 --> 01:23:14,740
He's still friends with all those kids.
I still get it. Again, still tagging it.

1423
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:19,690
That's so wrong. He lets them
in a Neverland, but like, uh,

1424
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:23,560
I don't remember who said this first.
It does definitely isn't my idea.

1425
01:23:23,561 --> 01:23:27,100
I just can't remember who said it.
Someone was saying that like

1426
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:31,260
all the, all, all the evidence was there.

1427
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:36,400
Like what kind of a grown ass man has a
goddamn amusement park at his house and

1428
01:23:38,530 --> 01:23:41,180
100% they were just saying like,
this is like,

1429
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:46,220
this is the most ridiculous thing ever.
That this guy is accused of pedophilia.

1430
01:23:46,250 --> 01:23:49,970
Any has an amusement park
for children in his house.

1431
01:23:50,420 --> 01:23:55,010
And he talks like a child.
Like, wait, what? No, no,

1432
01:23:55,011 --> 01:23:58,760
he's fine. You don't leave your kids
with them. He'll be fine. It's just,

1433
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:01,000
it's a crazy,

1434
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:04,790
insane aberration that somehow or another,

1435
01:24:04,791 --> 01:24:09,791
a child who grows up with this dominant
father in this family of musicians and

1436
01:24:10,691 --> 01:24:13,030
they're all singing and dancing
and travel in the country.

1437
01:24:13,031 --> 01:24:16,690
And he's loved by everybody from
the time he was a little kid. Dude,

1438
01:24:16,691 --> 01:24:20,860
if you've watched the Jackson five,
think about this.

1439
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:25,900
Think about if you were Tito or Jermaine
or any of these other people that were

1440
01:24:25,901 --> 01:24:28,300
Jacksons. Think about who they are. Okay.

1441
01:24:29,050 --> 01:24:34,050
These are grown ass men and and
older children of this supernova.

1442
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:40,630
Your, your parents had a bunch of
kids and they had one Super Nova.

1443
01:24:41,050 --> 01:24:45,040
They had Janet Jackson, they
had Tito, they had Jermaine,

1444
01:24:45,041 --> 01:24:50,041
they had a Latoya that all these
Jacksons and then they had Michael this

1445
01:24:51,310 --> 01:24:55,720
nucleus,
this fucking just white hot thing.

1446
01:24:57,670 --> 01:25:00,040
So much that everybody goes,
he's got a son,

1447
01:25:00,340 --> 01:25:04,510
he's gonna say he's going to dance
and he does it on TV and he hits it

1448
01:25:04,511 --> 01:25:05,350
perfectly.

1449
01:25:05,890 --> 01:25:10,480
He hits a perfectly t for anybody to
ever try to figure out what it would like

1450
01:25:10,481 --> 01:25:12,670
to be would it would be
like to be Michael Jackson.

1451
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:17,850
You've got to watch Michael Jackson when
he was on TV when he was a little kid,

1452
01:25:19,290 --> 01:25:21,070
but it pull,
pull some of that up Jamie,

1453
01:25:21,310 --> 01:25:24,550
because I think we could all like,

1454
01:25:25,810 --> 01:25:29,260
we can all agree. Let's just agree on some
stuff before we talk about this. Okay?

1455
01:25:29,261 --> 01:25:32,620
Pedophilia is one of the worst things you
could ever do. For sure. We all agree,

1456
01:25:32,621 --> 01:25:33,250
right?

1457
01:25:33,250 --> 01:25:36,640
We all agree that anybody that harms a
child is a terrible fucking person and we

1458
01:25:36,641 --> 01:25:39,040
don't want that in our
world. We all agree, right?

1459
01:25:40,930 --> 01:25:45,880
But let's look at this, this
life. Let's look at his life.

1460
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:49,660
Let's try to look at it outside of that
judgment, which we all agree on and say,

1461
01:25:49,661 --> 01:25:53,200
this is these, this life, this
choice, this, this situation.

1462
01:25:53,201 --> 01:25:56,530
A scenario that he was
born into is not his idea.

1463
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,390
It is not his idea to be this little
tiny person who is exposed to millions of

1464
01:26:01,391 --> 01:26:04,040
people on television.
It's not

1465
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:08,360
his idea. And so you're looking at
right now, play this man. What does this

1466
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:13,460
look it? Look how good he is
to look at this. Turn this up.

1467
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:24,530
Totally adorable. Oh
my God. He was amazing.

1468
01:26:25,130 --> 01:26:28,100
Look at his brother's in the background.
How much they hate life.

1469
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:31,550
You got a bunch of dudes who
are already getting laid.

1470
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:35,540
One of them doesn't do anything but
dance is seems the Middle Guy. Yeah,

1471
01:26:35,541 --> 01:26:39,860
and then there's another little guy
who's like, Michael, do it now. I'm next

1472
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:45,950
round. Diamonds are, first of all,

1473
01:26:45,951 --> 01:26:50,210
they're excellent musicians. Listen to
this song. Crack this shit up, Jamie.

1474
01:26:55,570 --> 01:26:57,300
God Damn,
this is good.

1475
01:26:57,870 --> 01:27:01,340
The sudden having music play this out

1476
01:27:02,850 --> 01:27:07,560
afterwards. It's just when
he's drunk. No Grammar,

1477
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:11,960
no drum.
Jamie's right

1478
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,530
Jamie. Just spended my
fucking love for this song.

1479
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:20,190
It's about the bill of goods
though. Mass. We'll look at him.

1480
01:27:22,970 --> 01:27:25,830
Look at him. Go Man. He's got
a leather vest on with tassels.

1481
01:27:25,831 --> 01:27:27,330
Like he's the outlaw Josey Wales.

1482
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:37,740
Oh my God. This is incredible. Which
ones? Tito, Tito guy. I don't know.

1483
01:27:37,741 --> 01:27:41,300
I don't know who anybody is. I
know Michael Jackson is, I'm the,

1484
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:44,970
I'm a casual fan and I feel
bad for that right now.

1485
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:54,900
I
is this great.

1486
01:28:00,350 --> 01:28:01,680
God Damn,
this is good.

1487
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:10,530
I got news for you,
man.

1488
01:28:10,531 --> 01:28:15,260
If this shit was on Conan O'brien
tomorrow and these guys below up,

1489
01:28:15,470 --> 01:28:19,190
they will blow up like Mount Saint Helens.

1490
01:28:20,330 --> 01:28:24,190
They would blow up. This
is just good. This is a,

1491
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:26,930
an entertaining,
tight performance

1492
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:31,140
of a Badass band. And they could dress
the same way. They're dress right now.

1493
01:28:31,350 --> 01:28:35,040
They could dress the exact same way,
do this exact same show that's coming.

1494
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:38,970
We're all gonna have our virtual hologram.
We get to go see them again,

1495
01:28:38,971 --> 01:28:43,850
but in Hologram form at a place. I
know, but I mean that place that,

1496
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:48,060
that whole that in Chicago,
man, that looked real like
they have a trunk. You Go.

1497
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,940
No, no. My friend produced it
was one of the producers of it.

1498
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,050
And then this is the one that chief Keef
that got this got shut down, right? Yeah,

1499
01:28:55,051 --> 01:28:57,420
the mayor. Chef key for
chief. Good. Thank you.

1500
01:28:58,910 --> 01:29:02,220
I get a a squash butternut suit.
I get really,

1501
01:29:02,220 --> 01:29:05,580
I'm very white. I get so
confused. I'm so sorry.

1502
01:29:06,060 --> 01:29:09,740
So he got shut down. He was doing,
they did his hologram. Yeah.

1503
01:29:09,780 --> 01:29:12,450
And it got shut down by the police,
by the mayor.

1504
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:16,650
The mayor pretty much just came
on and stepped in and said, hey,

1505
01:29:16,710 --> 01:29:20,340
I don't like this guy because
he had some warrants in Chicago.

1506
01:29:20,370 --> 01:29:23,940
This is in Chicago, knows happening,
Indiana. They had to move it to Indiana,

1507
01:29:24,450 --> 01:29:26,170
but they,

1508
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:29,880
they pretty much told him to just pull
the plug on it after the first song.

1509
01:29:29,881 --> 01:29:33,870
So the first song, first song
hall, Graham, chief Keef came out,

1510
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:35,160
everything was going fine.

1511
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:38,760
That mayor then told him to turn off
all the electricity there and pulled it,

1512
01:29:38,970 --> 01:29:43,280
which is, you know, freedom
of speech thing for one. Uh,

1513
01:29:43,290 --> 01:29:45,960
and there's also a lot
of weird laws about,

1514
01:29:45,961 --> 01:29:49,590
cause this was broadcast live and the
mayor just came in and was like, Eh,

1515
01:29:49,620 --> 01:29:54,240
I don't like this guy. And like pulled
it a live performance just because, uh,

1516
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:55,110
you know,

1517
01:29:55,110 --> 01:30:00,060
has there been any sort of an examination
of what the mayors allowed to do? Yeah.

1518
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:03,460
What he's legally allowed to do? I
don't know, but it seems like, I mean,

1519
01:30:03,630 --> 01:30:07,350
when I first heard about, I immediately
was like, this does not seem legal.

1520
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:10,140
You know, what if this was, you
know, the end on top of this,

1521
01:30:10,141 --> 01:30:13,110
this was to raise money
for, uh, you know, uh,

1522
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:15,650
the people that were
affected by that huge, uh,

1523
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:19,500
all these people got shot in Chicago
recently, like a ton of people.

1524
01:30:19,501 --> 01:30:22,920
And ever a child that, and this was
to raise money for them. And uh,

1525
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:27,120
listen to that. Hold on a
second. [inaudible] I know
nothing about chief Keef,

1526
01:30:27,121 --> 01:30:31,140
Mayor Mcdermott, he's
only 46. The mayor said,

1527
01:30:31,620 --> 01:30:36,620
all I'd heard is that he has a lot of
songs about gangs and shooting people at

1528
01:30:37,351 --> 01:30:42,120
history.
That's anti-cop pro gang and pro drug use.

1529
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:44,470
He's been basically outlawed in Chicago.

1530
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:49,500
We're not going to let you circumvent
mayor Emanuel by going next door.

1531
01:30:49,831 --> 01:30:53,550
The Chicago Mayor's office
did not immediately respond
to a request for comment.

1532
01:30:53,610 --> 01:30:57,360
Isn't that hilarious? So he's a quote
from that. They didn't comment who?

1533
01:30:57,450 --> 01:31:00,360
The mayor, if the mayor is uh, uh,

1534
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:05,170
Indiana mayor where this manual?
Chicago mayor. Oh, okay. Different Dude.

1535
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:09,060
Okay. So the Indiana mayor is
only 46, but the Chicago mayor,

1536
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:12,450
so the Chicago mayor contacted
the Indiana mayor and said, Hey,

1537
01:31:12,451 --> 01:31:16,050
shut that shit down. Shut it down. Which
could know they could just do that.

1538
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:19,140
It's a Hologram. And Hey guys,
let's, let's talk about ice cube.

1539
01:31:19,141 --> 01:31:20,730
Let's talk about jokster dre.

1540
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:24,300
Let's talk about any of these
other fucking people that
did the exact same thing.

1541
01:31:24,490 --> 01:31:27,960
Nwa All talked about killing cops,
shooting cops,

1542
01:31:27,961 --> 01:31:30,600
fuck the police and all that stuff,
and you guys are celebrating.

1543
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:33,570
Why don't you pull all the beats
headphones out of all the stores,

1544
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:35,730
mayor of Indiana for saying,
you know,

1545
01:31:35,731 --> 01:31:38,850
all this shit you've said in your past
music that now we're all going to see in

1546
01:31:38,851 --> 01:31:43,420
the new Nwa movie and it's uh, we're all
going to be singing it again. So yeah,

1547
01:31:43,490 --> 01:31:44,311
right at a time,

1548
01:31:44,311 --> 01:31:47,820
right now having Nwa the movie
come out is so strong and powerful,

1549
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:50,940
but this guy trying to raise some
money, uh, not, not even him,

1550
01:31:50,941 --> 01:31:54,810
a whole gram version of him trying to
raise money and they shut it down after

1551
01:31:54,811 --> 01:31:58,350
the first song. I just don't
think, if no one's doing a crime,

1552
01:31:58,380 --> 01:32:00,160
you should be to say that

1553
01:32:00,160 --> 01:32:01,450
saying words,

1554
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:05,440
unless you likes organizing
some sort of attack on someone.

1555
01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:09,810
But the idea that you're saying words
mean,

1556
01:32:09,820 --> 01:32:13,660
what does every movie that we
go to see? I just, what is,

1557
01:32:13,690 --> 01:32:15,220
what does every gangster movie,
Oh,

1558
01:32:15,221 --> 01:32:20,110
should we stop the creation of
gangster movies? Bunny hat, fake bugs.

1559
01:32:20,111 --> 01:32:22,210
Bunny had dynamite.
Tons of explosions.

1560
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:25,890
We tried to kill a lot of
violence in that Wiley,

1561
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:27,340
coyote and bugs bunny.

1562
01:32:27,341 --> 01:32:31,090
But I'm sure bugs bunny was involved
in an explosion or two. Yeah. Yeah.

1563
01:32:32,770 --> 01:32:36,590
Every fucking movie we love has
destruction, right? Everybody says that.

1564
01:32:36,610 --> 01:32:40,120
Murder's bad. Everybody says that. But
how many fucking movies of murder in it?

1565
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:44,410
Jesus Christ. Right? What percentage of
them? Let's just Gambino's murder in it.

1566
01:32:44,610 --> 01:32:48,220
We don't get, we don't know. Okay. This
is a beautiful subject right here. Don't,

1567
01:32:48,221 --> 01:32:49,150
don't even look at Jamie.

1568
01:32:49,151 --> 01:32:54,151
I want you to guess what percentage
of movies have murdering them?

1569
01:32:55,450 --> 01:32:58,210
Guest Jamie.
First murder.

1570
01:33:00,620 --> 01:33:03,190
Oh Wow. All movies. That's
a big thing. So, I dunno.

1571
01:33:03,230 --> 01:33:08,110
40% 40% American,
some sort of murder.

1572
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:10,840
Brian, what do you think?
Well, I was going to go higher,

1573
01:33:10,841 --> 01:33:15,370
but since he went so lower,
lower, uh, all movies,

1574
01:33:15,371 --> 01:33:19,400
I'd probably say murder or
violence, right? Just murder. Uh,

1575
01:33:19,410 --> 01:33:22,840
I'd probably say 32%.

1576
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:27,940
32%. All right. Well, let's find out.
Jamie, why don't you Google that?

1577
01:33:29,680 --> 01:33:31,450
I'm trying to figure it out.
It's too difficult.

1578
01:33:31,750 --> 01:33:34,420
It's too difficult for me to do while
I'm doing the show still because you're

1579
01:33:34,421 --> 01:33:36,280
just too many statistics
you'd have to go through.

1580
01:33:36,580 --> 01:33:40,900
There's like a lot of it is surveys found
82% of Americans believe that movies

1581
01:33:40,901 --> 01:33:43,600
have too much violence. Okay.
That's not what I asked for.

1582
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:47,230
You fuck different people.
How many times they've died in movies?

1583
01:33:47,770 --> 01:33:50,890
If I had to guess, I'd say
10%. Wow. What did you say?

1584
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:55,300
32% to would you say genuine?
40. 40. I think I said 10,

1585
01:33:55,810 --> 01:33:58,510
right? 10. I don't think, uh,

1586
01:33:58,870 --> 01:34:03,040
I think in real life,
if 10% of people who got murdered,

1587
01:34:03,041 --> 01:34:06,460
you'd be fucking terrified. There'll
be a horrible world to live in. I mean,

1588
01:34:06,461 --> 01:34:10,780
that's like Gingiss Khan days.
10% of the people die, right?

1589
01:34:11,230 --> 01:34:14,590
You have a short lifespan.
If he's like short cycles of human beings,

1590
01:34:15,940 --> 01:34:19,450
just keep having babies and keep dying
off quick and known, figured out anything.

1591
01:34:20,290 --> 01:34:24,160
What percentage do you think, Jamie? I
didn't hear all the questions. Sorry. No,

1592
01:34:24,170 --> 01:34:25,760
what percent.
I mean you're doing it right.

1593
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:28,840
We found out that I actually just found
the same thing. You just found, oh,

1594
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:32,800
we'll figure it out. But
I think that, uh, it's,

1595
01:34:33,130 --> 01:34:37,210
I think the numbers thing is like
very deceptive. They weighed a lot,

1596
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:38,500
a lot of deceptive numbers.

1597
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:41,800
How many deceptive numbers of people
that are fucking up the world?

1598
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:45,130
What are the deceptive numbers
of a dummies out there?

1599
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:48,820
I don't think there's nearly as many
as everybody thinks hers. You know,

1600
01:34:48,821 --> 01:34:51,990
I think a lot of the dummies are
unhappy being dummies and we'll,

1601
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,740
we'll keep them dummies forever.

1602
01:34:54,220 --> 01:34:57,980
We'll never allow them to not be
dummies anymore. You know, they get

1603
01:34:58,010 --> 01:35:01,700
trapped and will dummy
world some dummy friends.

1604
01:35:03,780 --> 01:35:07,910
I, I also, you know, I saw the
house of blues the other day.

1605
01:35:07,940 --> 01:35:12,140
They had this free concert on sunset
and they originally went to the Roxy and

1606
01:35:12,141 --> 01:35:16,400
there were like, uh, is this
guy named justice? What's his
name? Oh, future a future.

1607
01:35:16,401 --> 01:35:20,930
That shouldn't be your name, sir. You
can't have that as a name. Just like,

1608
01:35:20,931 --> 01:35:22,460
I can't have math as a name.

1609
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:27,050
You can't call yourself future.
That's just ridiculous.

1610
01:35:27,860 --> 01:35:31,820
That's like a known word
that's like I'm tripod.

1611
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:36,740
So using the hold will be channel
slept dog. I'm tripod, tripod.

1612
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:40,760
I like that tripod. It's implied you
have a large penis, but he shut down.

1613
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:44,000
He shut down the row. They, they
had a free show at the Roxy.

1614
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:45,980
So many people showed up like
a thousand people or something.

1615
01:35:45,981 --> 01:35:48,710
Like they had to shut down
sunset boulevard at the Roxy.

1616
01:35:48,830 --> 01:35:52,250
So then they moved it to the House
of Blues and the same shit happened.

1617
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:54,560
Like it was like I had to
go on stage and the whole,

1618
01:35:54,590 --> 01:35:58,550
there was swat team guys with guns
on the side of the comedy store.

1619
01:35:58,551 --> 01:36:01,220
There was helicopters and then somebody,

1620
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:03,860
something happened where people
were like spraying like uh,

1621
01:36:03,861 --> 01:36:07,540
extinguishers or smoke bombs and he had
to shut the whole thing down. But for,

1622
01:36:07,560 --> 01:36:08,750
for a second there,

1623
01:36:08,751 --> 01:36:12,800
it was amazing how fast that could have
turned into a riot situation and stuff

1624
01:36:12,801 --> 01:36:15,800
like that. So when the,
this concert was shut down,

1625
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:19,790
you would think that they were trying
to control a riot of some kind,

1626
01:36:19,970 --> 01:36:24,970
or what would be the reason
other than taking money out of a,

1627
01:36:25,180 --> 01:36:29,940
uh, uh, event that was for
a toddler that died, uh,

1628
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:34,430
due to violence, do you think that would
be a place that would have violence?

1629
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:38,140
Is that a benefit show for a toddler?
Well,

1630
01:36:38,690 --> 01:36:39,650
because of violence,

1631
01:36:39,870 --> 01:36:40,381
here's the thing.

1632
01:36:40,381 --> 01:36:44,310
It shouldn't be the mayor's arbitrary
decision to decide to shut down a show

1633
01:36:44,311 --> 01:36:44,761
like that.

1634
01:36:44,761 --> 01:36:49,500
Especially to do it while you got to
think he's probably grand standing, right?

1635
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:50,460
You know,
that's what he's doing.

1636
01:36:50,461 --> 01:36:53,580
He's making a big stand and he's
going to stop gang violence.

1637
01:36:53,581 --> 01:36:55,340
And we all agree that's,

1638
01:36:55,350 --> 01:36:58,050
it's better to have less violence in
the world's better to have less fun.

1639
01:36:58,070 --> 01:37:02,640
But you can't just decide in the middle
of a show to shut it down. That's stupid.

1640
01:37:02,910 --> 01:37:06,100
And that's not thinking about the future
because you're going to have a whole,

1641
01:37:06,270 --> 01:37:09,200
how many people are at a show, like
10,000 fucking people or something crazy.

1642
01:37:09,230 --> 01:37:12,430
It's a huge festival or some kind
of festival. Right? So let's,

1643
01:37:12,431 --> 01:37:15,330
let's just say it's 10,000 people.
How many people were there to see them?

1644
01:37:15,331 --> 01:37:17,910
They're all there to see him.
You shut it down. They're mad.

1645
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:21,270
So now you've got a group of people that
aren't just going to get entertained.

1646
01:37:21,630 --> 01:37:25,110
They're mad if criminals are
criminals all the fucking time,

1647
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:29,610
24 hours a day, seven days a week,
what kind of a world would it be?

1648
01:37:29,620 --> 01:37:32,790
Would be crazy. It would be like
criminals would be like zombies.

1649
01:37:32,940 --> 01:37:35,490
They would just be just running
around, grabbing things. They're not.

1650
01:37:35,770 --> 01:37:40,110
So they gotta be in a situation where
crime could erupt. Most of the time,

1651
01:37:40,111 --> 01:37:42,150
criminals aren't committing crimes.

1652
01:37:42,270 --> 01:37:45,660
Even the most hardened criminals
out of their waking day.

1653
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:48,360
What percentage is actually
dedicated to crime?

1654
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:51,150
It's probably pretty fucking small,
right?

1655
01:37:51,570 --> 01:37:56,220
But now if you set them up in
this situation where you take away

1656
01:37:56,220 --> 01:38:01,220
their money and you sh you stopped their
show and you stop it because you don't

1657
01:38:02,161 --> 01:38:06,450
like what this person is saying on stage
and now they're in a position where

1658
01:38:06,451 --> 01:38:11,010
they feel wronged,
they feel like you owe them.

1659
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,370
You have to you, you've created
a feeling of that. Yeah.

1660
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:18,060
You've created a feeling of anger
and parked. I had to call off work,

1661
01:38:18,061 --> 01:38:19,080
I had to do this.

1662
01:38:19,081 --> 01:38:24,081
I like now you've just created a
mob of people against the system.

1663
01:38:24,730 --> 01:38:26,070
The good man.
Yeah,

1664
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:30,090
it's not smart and there's a lot of cool
videos of that night where you know the

1665
01:38:30,091 --> 01:38:30,871
show was going on,

1666
01:38:30,871 --> 01:38:34,710
everything was going great and you just
see in the background for like a one 80

1667
01:38:34,860 --> 01:38:39,030
just these lights coming closer and closer
of all the cop cars just coming from

1668
01:38:39,031 --> 01:38:43,740
the distance because Indiana is flat is
fuck. So you can see just not so true.

1669
01:38:43,741 --> 01:38:45,510
I didn't even think of, yeah, it's a,

1670
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:48,480
that's a weird thing about getting
away with crime in Indiana.

1671
01:38:48,481 --> 01:38:51,190
You fucking look around. All you
need is like a, yeah, a tower.

1672
01:38:55,290 --> 01:39:00,290
Like you've got about 30 seconds that
covered about six miles away getting the

1673
01:39:00,331 --> 01:39:04,710
fucking car. Let's do this
drive. Slow drive sob. I saw.
It's really great though.

1674
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:09,090
Like these apps like periscope and things
like that that are really using it as

1675
01:39:09,091 --> 01:39:12,270
for the news and for kind of
like crime checking, you know,

1676
01:39:12,330 --> 01:39:15,800
like I got a video of you. What do you
think about these drones? Like the,

1677
01:39:15,801 --> 01:39:20,240
the fact that they're able
to use, when I was, um, uh,

1678
01:39:20,270 --> 01:39:21,810
up in Canada a couple months ago,

1679
01:39:21,811 --> 01:39:25,950
it was one of those guys who's a friend
of a friend had a drone and it was

1680
01:39:25,951 --> 01:39:30,090
hooked up to his iPhone and I was
like, this is crazy. What is this?

1681
01:39:30,300 --> 01:39:35,100
He's showing me video from his iPhone on
his iPhone of this fucking robot that's

1682
01:39:35,101 --> 01:39:38,250
just flying around. I'm
like, that is insane.

1683
01:39:38,251 --> 01:39:42,150
I can't believe you can actually do
this. Have you heard of Lilly? No,

1684
01:39:42,151 --> 01:39:46,210
I can't wait. It comes out very soon.
Lily, is this like, it's like the,

1685
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:50,940
it looks like it's going to be the,
like the first iPhone of drones.

1686
01:39:50,970 --> 01:39:54,600
Like it's going to be one of the ones,
it's like your own personal drone check.

1687
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:59,370
Check this video. It's pretty
sweet. All this shit it can do well,

1688
01:39:59,400 --> 01:40:04,050
here's a commercial. So I think,
I don't know, maybe Jamie,

1689
01:40:04,051 --> 01:40:06,600
you can pull it up.
Probably be better. Uh,

1690
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:10,980
so what is the idea that it's a better
drone? It's, it's just like here you're,

1691
01:40:10,981 --> 01:40:11,790
you're holding it.

1692
01:40:11,790 --> 01:40:14,640
You can just throw it in the air
and it turns on automatically.

1693
01:40:14,641 --> 01:40:18,810
You could have it either fall you at
directly behind you side, sideways.

1694
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:24,060
And it's adorable looking at turn
up the volume. It's got eyes.

1695
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:26,130
She looks kind of like a blue little,

1696
01:40:26,190 --> 01:40:30,510
see how he just threw it up and
then I followed, yeah, look,

1697
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:33,110
come on.
And so it's going to track your,

1698
01:40:33,180 --> 01:40:36,270
this is just showing if you were
going to be a snowboarder and my God,

1699
01:40:36,271 --> 01:40:39,300
we have HD, we have robot falcons. Yeah.

1700
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:44,040
This is a robot Falcon Falcon that follows
you around and he comes to you and it

1701
01:40:44,041 --> 01:40:48,150
comes shipped to the fuzzy landing,
20 minute flight time.

1702
01:40:48,180 --> 01:40:50,820
All my throat over a bridge.
God,

1703
01:40:50,821 --> 01:40:53,220
this is the craziest Shit
I've ever seen in my life.

1704
01:40:54,330 --> 01:40:58,770
Uh Oh my God. It's just walk
like grand theft auto style.

1705
01:40:58,790 --> 01:41:01,690
Just walk behind you.
Oh my God.

1706
01:41:02,710 --> 01:41:05,710
One of the coolest things is going
to Kayak. You can just go as fast.

1707
01:41:05,740 --> 01:41:09,220
How fast can it go? It goes, I don't
know what, how fast they usually go,

1708
01:41:09,221 --> 01:41:13,510
but it's pretty much if, oh, you
were tracking Weist. Oh my God.

1709
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:19,510
Oh my God. Look at that. You wear a
tracking device around your wrists. Yeah,

1710
01:41:20,470 --> 01:41:20,760
dude,

1711
01:41:20,760 --> 01:41:24,160
we're live and love future could either
go in front of you and lead or follow.

1712
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:25,510
Oh my God.

1713
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:30,140
And we're talking 60 frames
a second full HD. Oh,

1714
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:34,630
fixing your backpack. Oh
my God. This is crazy.

1715
01:41:34,660 --> 01:41:37,750
Grandma could use it to
make sure follows her.

1716
01:41:38,410 --> 01:41:41,110
Oh my God,
Dude.

1717
01:41:41,111 --> 01:41:44,260
How long before people give up their
bodies for that just blew my head to the

1718
01:41:44,261 --> 01:41:48,180
top of that thing.
You know,

1719
01:41:48,190 --> 01:41:51,070
there's gonna come a point in time where
human beings have like a biological

1720
01:41:51,071 --> 01:41:54,010
meeting and we decided now that
we have genetic engineering,

1721
01:41:54,040 --> 01:41:55,890
should we decide to continue with

1722
01:41:56,080 --> 01:42:00,010
shape? Should we decide to continue
with this shape? What is love?

1723
01:42:00,310 --> 01:42:01,870
What is beauty in the eye of the beholder?

1724
01:42:02,050 --> 01:42:04,480
Could we all be better
off if we were flying?

1725
01:42:04,481 --> 01:42:07,300
Jellyfish are nice.

1726
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:11,450
They come up with this proposition
to be able to replace a,

1727
01:42:11,470 --> 01:42:13,630
with a simple prescription,
uh,

1728
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:18,750
any feelings of love or sex or
affection that people need or want.

1729
01:42:19,150 --> 01:42:20,450
It's all satiated.
You,

1730
01:42:20,451 --> 01:42:25,150
you never have to worry about reclaiming
that again and that the most harmonious

1731
01:42:25,151 --> 01:42:26,680
shape for the universe,

1732
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:30,310
the most harmonious shaped
to coexist forever with a,

1733
01:42:30,350 --> 01:42:34,240
an infinite lifespan is flying jellyfish.

1734
01:42:35,410 --> 01:42:39,520
How long before we'd all be
flying jellyfish, seven years,

1735
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:42,070
the way that thing just flew.
I want it to be that thing.

1736
01:42:42,670 --> 01:42:46,040
I know it's good to just fight
through it off a bridge, right?

1737
01:42:46,110 --> 01:42:46,880
Wish someone gets throw,

1738
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,540
just throw you off a bridge and you
just won't shred this. And this is,

1739
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:54,850
imagine that technology in 20 years
where that thing's falling around all day

1740
01:42:54,851 --> 01:42:59,350
long, all night long. I imagine
that in the shape of Dicks,

1741
01:42:59,530 --> 01:43:02,740
imagine what's the figure out that the
shape of a dick is really not perfect.

1742
01:43:02,830 --> 01:43:03,050
You know,

1743
01:43:03,050 --> 01:43:05,950
just like there's other shit that's wrong
with people like the fact that so easy

1744
01:43:05,951 --> 01:43:10,390
to knock us out. Yeah, that's a big
flaw. Punch somebody in the chin,

1745
01:43:10,391 --> 01:43:12,130
they go unconscious is a stupid flaw.

1746
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:17,290
What if they realized like
dicks are good but have a seat.

1747
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:20,170
I'm going to show you the new,
we're going to show you the next level,

1748
01:43:21,010 --> 01:43:25,300
the next level, some sort of new thing,
and it gets inside you and just expands,

1749
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:28,260
expands like a fist,

1750
01:43:28,530 --> 01:43:33,530
but soon a few little dicks all around
a tube like this or the the main dick

1751
01:43:33,761 --> 01:43:37,090
tube and it's spreads out like corn,
you know,

1752
01:43:37,091 --> 01:43:38,620
and it's all a little Dick's inside.

1753
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:47,170
Imagine if your Dick was, uh, this might
be the dumbest thing I've ever said.

1754
01:43:47,620 --> 01:43:50,860
Imagine if your deck was like an ear
of corn and each one of those little

1755
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:52,040
kernels was another

1756
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:55,160
dick. And once your Dick got in
there and we'd, Dick was hard,

1757
01:43:55,161 --> 01:43:58,790
you dick got in there, then
all those little dicks would
pop out and move it all.

1758
01:43:58,791 --> 01:44:03,410
Like they would all play music inside
the girl's vagina, downtown, downtown,

1759
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:08,600
downtown tome.
And that would be the thing.

1760
01:44:08,601 --> 01:44:10,490
Like the girls could come the hardest.

1761
01:44:10,491 --> 01:44:14,660
You've made the best music
inside their vagina. Oh, Joe.

1762
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:17,930
That's what I'm saying.
Right? Good. Listen.

1763
01:44:17,931 --> 01:44:19,790
That's a very important point.

1764
01:44:20,990 --> 01:44:23,960
We just assuming that the Dick shape
that we have currently is the best,

1765
01:44:24,110 --> 01:44:27,320
but if you had the dick shape we had
currently and the ability to make music

1766
01:44:27,321 --> 01:44:30,290
with your deck, right? Yeah. Jamie. Jamie,

1767
01:44:30,291 --> 01:44:35,180
don't look at me like what kind of
music you, donk, Donk, donk, downtown,

1768
01:44:35,210 --> 01:44:40,160
some Beethoven Shit.
Piano or a violin or mostly like drums.

1769
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:43,550
I guess it depends on what you're
trying to accomplish. Yeah.

1770
01:44:43,551 --> 01:44:47,000
I'm more of like a you a
Bongo player or a bass drum.

1771
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:51,290
I can see Jamie playing upon.
Guys had a party, play a gym day.

1772
01:44:52,990 --> 01:44:57,090
Uh, if you were a sex act, would you be

1773
01:44:57,130 --> 01:45:02,110
V if you are a sex act and
also a musical instrument,

1774
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:05,230
what is sex act?

1775
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:08,450
And I was asking him who's the bongos
or if he was the bass drum would

1776
01:45:08,451 --> 01:45:12,430
definitely be the band. Would
you be the trumpet? Yeah. Oh,

1777
01:45:12,431 --> 01:45:15,330
would you be the trombone trumpet?
It's a phone.

1778
01:45:18,170 --> 01:45:18,790
Every man wants,
let's

1779
01:45:18,790 --> 01:45:23,180
be the electric guitar,
right? Yeah. Good. All right.

1780
01:45:24,490 --> 01:45:28,270
What's the plate first? If you had a
big buck, the best sound, best sound,

1781
01:45:28,370 --> 01:45:30,860
the best sound.
And all of music to me,

1782
01:45:30,861 --> 01:45:35,861
I think like the sound that makes me
go the most gold fuck is like awesome

1783
01:45:36,441 --> 01:45:38,930
guitar. Like someone who
really nails it like that.

1784
01:45:38,931 --> 01:45:42,520
I'm the solo in um,
uh,

1785
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:45,680
Leonard skittered the solo
and Freebird you know,

1786
01:45:45,681 --> 01:45:48,830
you know that solo when they get there
there's like a two and a half minute long

1787
01:45:48,831 --> 01:45:51,860
solo or something like that.
My personal opinion,

1788
01:45:51,890 --> 01:45:54,530
I think it's the greatest
solo and all of music.

1789
01:45:54,830 --> 01:45:56,880
I think it's the greatest
guitar solo ever. I,

1790
01:45:56,970 --> 01:46:00,770
I listened to that fucking thing like once
a month it's like, like a little like,

1791
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:05,000
uh, like an equinox or something like
that or a a full moon once a month.

1792
01:46:05,001 --> 01:46:09,560
I have to hear that guitar solo cause
it's so good. It's just this is,

1793
01:46:09,650 --> 01:46:11,780
I don't think I've ever
thought that way about drums.

1794
01:46:13,300 --> 01:46:16,760
He's never one time that I had to listen
to a drum solo over and over and over

1795
01:46:16,761 --> 01:46:19,610
again. It doesn't, it's not
that I don't appreciate drums.

1796
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:23,930
I love drums and if it wasn't
for the drums, the whole
song wouldn't be the same.

1797
01:46:23,931 --> 01:46:27,230
Like no song will be the same.
But if I had to pick like one sound,

1798
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:31,280
like what's the one sound that I enjoy
most for whatever reason is to the guitar

1799
01:46:31,370 --> 01:46:31,790
and I don't,

1800
01:46:31,790 --> 01:46:35,810
I don't think it's the electric guitar
or the Acoustic Guitar because some of my

1801
01:46:35,811 --> 01:46:36,940
favorite guitar moments,

1802
01:46:36,941 --> 01:46:40,610
it'd been like people we've had in the
studio like Everlast Everlast playing

1803
01:46:40,611 --> 01:46:44,930
guitar or like a Ben and Suzanne
from honey, honey playing guitar,

1804
01:46:44,931 --> 01:46:48,950
like in studio or Banjo. There's something
about someone touching something,

1805
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:50,040
their fingers,

1806
01:46:50,370 --> 01:46:53,040
whether it's a banjo or
whether it's a guitar.

1807
01:46:53,041 --> 01:46:58,041
I know you're creating with your fingers
and it's got this crazy metal sound is

1808
01:46:58,741 --> 01:47:03,510
wire in this fucking echoey sound
and that's my favorite sound.

1809
01:47:03,870 --> 01:47:08,190
I've, I've come to that conclusion. Those
are my, that's my favorite musical sound.

1810
01:47:09,140 --> 01:47:12,030
I like drums alive there. There's a
few songs like you're right though.

1811
01:47:12,031 --> 01:47:15,990
For the most part it's guitar,
but there's a few drum solos that,

1812
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:18,330
I mean piggy by nine inch nails.
Back in the day,

1813
01:47:18,331 --> 01:47:22,410
Chris Farina used to have one of my
favorite. This guy's plan a guitar,

1814
01:47:22,420 --> 01:47:24,870
dropped his iPhone inside his
guitar and put the camera out.

1815
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:28,590
And you're seeing like each of the wave
forms on each string that he's playing

1816
01:47:28,591 --> 01:47:32,040
and like it's a visual visit.
Camera can't keep up with the vibrations.

1817
01:47:32,041 --> 01:47:35,520
Correct lists. I do not believe
this at all. No, that's,
that's what it looks like.

1818
01:47:36,300 --> 01:47:38,130
No,
but this has been reading done.

1819
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:43,080
This is not try it with your cameraman
attains an iPhone four it's a shitty

1820
01:47:43,081 --> 01:47:46,320
camera. So I think it's a similar to
what we were talking about with the rods.

1821
01:47:47,100 --> 01:47:50,700
It's just an artifact where the lens
of the camera can't keep up with it.

1822
01:47:50,701 --> 01:47:53,700
But it has this con, this changing
image at the front of it like that.

1823
01:47:53,701 --> 01:47:54,780
When you look at it with your eyes,

1824
01:47:54,781 --> 01:47:58,530
you can see if I'm doing this when I get
home. Yeah, you got to do this. Please do.

1825
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:03,150
Please do. Ah, alright.
He swiped your knee.

1826
01:48:04,830 --> 01:48:08,520
If there's one thing that I wish that I
did that I don't really wish that I did,

1827
01:48:09,170 --> 01:48:13,410
but I, I think it would be cool to know
you can still do it. It's not that hard.

1828
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:17,010
Nope. Nope. Time you learn how to not
interested with Bose real quick. Nope.

1829
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:21,360
You could learn to [inaudible]
pool game needs work.

1830
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:22,500
I'm trying to write jokes.

1831
01:48:23,400 --> 01:48:27,990
I want to be social only hang out with
my family and play those songs. You know,

1832
01:48:27,991 --> 01:48:31,690
you already said here at Aera sang songs.
He jumped bears on my songs to be,

1833
01:48:31,950 --> 01:48:36,720
especially if I get drunk for
a Roto and stuck with them. Uh,

1834
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:39,570
but if he did kid songs, how cool
would that be? Like how many do like,

1835
01:48:39,630 --> 01:48:43,770
oh we'll do this down. Oh yeah,
I want to do that with my kids.

1836
01:48:43,771 --> 01:48:46,800
They always gravitate towards
the same ridiculous stuff.

1837
01:48:47,430 --> 01:48:52,430
It always becomes about like buttholes
anuses cause they know it's hilarious.

1838
01:48:53,160 --> 01:48:54,310
Kids figured out early.

1839
01:48:54,311 --> 01:48:58,770
You don't even have to try to tell them
to say penis and butthole is hilarious

1840
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:01,590
and they just go to it and
then when you laugh they go,

1841
01:49:01,620 --> 01:49:05,760
oh I figured out what's funny.
Little cute people saying ridiculous shit.

1842
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:09,520
It is adorable. I think I knew it
but I wasn't allowed to say it.

1843
01:49:09,540 --> 01:49:11,850
If I were to say it, I would,
would've gotten a ton of trouble.

1844
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:15,420
Isn't it weird though that we try to
prevent kids from San Ridiculous Shit like

1845
01:49:15,421 --> 01:49:18,840
penis and butthole like that is
your butt hole. This is a penis.

1846
01:49:18,841 --> 01:49:20,790
Like what are we doing?
We're gonna have to raise robots.

1847
01:49:20,820 --> 01:49:25,440
Do you let your kids cuss like, dude,
no. This is what I tell kids and I cuss.

1848
01:49:25,450 --> 01:49:29,670
Very rarely. I swear to God
because very rarely around my kids,

1849
01:49:30,030 --> 01:49:33,690
but I do occasionally slips
out and my wife goes, you know,

1850
01:49:34,050 --> 01:49:36,520
you know like you should probably
shouldn't say that around the kids. I go,

1851
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:40,110
I guess you're right.
But all my favorite people swear like,

1852
01:49:40,111 --> 01:49:41,700
why do we have to wait
until they're old enough?

1853
01:49:41,940 --> 01:49:44,430
They swear because we're worried about
how they're going to appear to other

1854
01:49:44,431 --> 01:49:48,310
people. We'll look if everybody
talked away, the three of us talk.

1855
01:49:48,490 --> 01:49:51,430
Is that a bad thing? If kids talk
like that, is that a bad thing?

1856
01:49:51,540 --> 01:49:53,780
And what are we doing? We're not
mean. We're not. We're, we're,

1857
01:49:53,781 --> 01:49:57,460
we're not cussing about ridiculous shit.
You know,

1858
01:49:57,550 --> 01:50:01,360
you drive outside in, your
tire's flat, you go, fuck,

1859
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:02,620
is that so bad?

1860
01:50:02,850 --> 01:50:04,500
I feel like kids know,
they just know.

1861
01:50:04,770 --> 01:50:07,540
They learn quick who you don't say it
in front of like you don't say anything.

1862
01:50:07,560 --> 01:50:08,330
They do,

1863
01:50:08,330 --> 01:50:11,690
they they it slips out.
It's a part of your vernacular.

1864
01:50:11,691 --> 01:50:15,110
If you live 30 years of your life and
then you have a kid 30 years of saying

1865
01:50:15,111 --> 01:50:18,230
fuck. Most of us have said
Fox since we figured it out.

1866
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:20,720
As soon as you realize
what an impact fuck has,

1867
01:50:20,900 --> 01:50:24,860
well you'll actually like
seven or something like
that so and says fuck around

1868
01:50:24,910 --> 01:50:29,540
your kit. Get children just being
nice. The children are right here.

1869
01:50:30,550 --> 01:50:33,830
As soon as you realize that this
is like some Voodoo word, right,

1870
01:50:33,920 --> 01:50:38,270
you start using it.
I just think that the most important thing

1871
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:43,190
is like it's not language,
it's intent.

1872
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:45,710
Like what are you trying to
project by what you're saying?

1873
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:50,600
Cause all we're saying when when we
get upset about language and were being

1874
01:50:50,601 --> 01:50:51,530
ridiculous about it.

1875
01:50:51,531 --> 01:50:54,710
When you're saying that there's no way a
person should ever be able to say these

1876
01:50:54,711 --> 01:50:58,430
noises with their mouth,
what are those noises to you?

1877
01:50:58,610 --> 01:51:00,980
What are those noises to you
and what are those noises to me?

1878
01:51:01,100 --> 01:51:03,200
Because what it really
is about is about intent.

1879
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,870
And as soon as you pretend
that it's not about intent,

1880
01:51:06,290 --> 01:51:11,000
then you create this weird world
of like switches. It's on and off.

1881
01:51:11,001 --> 01:51:15,680
It's yes and no. And that's not, that's
not how people operate. You know,

1882
01:51:15,710 --> 01:51:20,270
people are weird. They're fucking
pliable. You know, people are strange.

1883
01:51:23,590 --> 01:51:26,950
Jamie has trained,
you see this drone shooting a gun.

1884
01:51:27,070 --> 01:51:30,880
That's what we have to look forward
to. I saw that too. That's real.

1885
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:35,380
I wanted to ask you, it looks fake
as fuck, but why wouldn't it be rail?

1886
01:51:35,440 --> 01:51:36,520
It's one of those things,
you know,

1887
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:40,300
why wouldn't it be really get
something to go backwards and forwards.

1888
01:51:40,301 --> 01:51:44,260
What you can't get it to pull a switch.
Oh my God.

1889
01:51:45,670 --> 01:51:49,210
And if you had a cross
hairs on it somehow.

1890
01:51:49,310 --> 01:51:51,980
Yeah.
Oh my God.

1891
01:51:54,220 --> 01:51:59,220
So this guy has a gun
that's flying around us.

1892
01:51:59,801 --> 01:52:03,970
The same guy, same guy, made this video
there showing yet. Remember that guy? Oh,

1893
01:52:03,971 --> 01:52:07,990
the guy that showed him being a taf or
recording video from a drone over a beach.

1894
01:52:08,660 --> 01:52:11,310
Yeah. Well, I don't believe
that. Is it the same guy? No,

1895
01:52:11,311 --> 01:52:14,110
I think this is all bullshit.
Why do you think it's bullshit?

1896
01:52:15,550 --> 01:52:18,010
I think that might be
real and I think I know.

1897
01:52:18,070 --> 01:52:19,690
I just don't think they're connected.
If that's connected.

1898
01:52:19,691 --> 01:52:24,580
That's crazy because so what's the
deal with drones? Anybody can have one.

1899
01:52:25,750 --> 01:52:29,430
You can do whatever you right. There's
no laws. You can't put a gun on. One.

1900
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:31,030
Made some real weird laws at fas.

1901
01:52:31,031 --> 01:52:34,180
Had to make some regulations on where
you can and can't fly him and whatnot and

1902
01:52:34,181 --> 01:52:37,210
how high they can can't do in
a rover police departments.

1903
01:52:37,240 --> 01:52:41,680
You can't do it over planned parenthoods.
Is this like the fucking Trojan horse?

1904
01:52:41,980 --> 01:52:46,310
Is the drone the Trojan horse? Look, it
was created by the government for military

1905
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:49,790
reasons and now they are selling it
where we can keep it in our book bagging.

1906
01:52:49,791 --> 01:52:52,880
Mom and dad can have their own drone
falling around the whole entire time.

1907
01:52:52,910 --> 01:52:54,500
In 10 years we'll all have a German,

1908
01:52:54,501 --> 01:52:58,520
they follows us around and records as
an HD 60 frames a second. Everyday we,

1909
01:52:58,521 --> 01:53:01,340
they found a way to put a drone in her
hand with periscope and all these other

1910
01:53:01,341 --> 01:53:02,000
things.

1911
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:06,530
They're going to have best babysitting
skills ever in our government.

1912
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:09,140
What about this?
What about the craziest idea of all time?

1913
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:14,440
What about they figure out a way to
have cameras and we're recording devices

1914
01:53:15,051 --> 01:53:19,520
that are so small that they're literally
invisible and they put them everywhere

1915
01:53:19,521 --> 01:53:23,120
and they work as a matrix.
So as you're walking down a hall,

1916
01:53:23,330 --> 01:53:27,410
this thing can recapture the images that
it sees in front of it and record it

1917
01:53:27,411 --> 01:53:31,280
all in real time and broadcast
it to anybody. Anyone, anywhere.

1918
01:53:32,090 --> 01:53:35,840
That's the future. There
flies. Well that's,

1919
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:40,070
that's the future man. It's not
just flies. I think it's molecules.

1920
01:53:40,910 --> 01:53:42,920
I think the cameras
become a part of the air.

1921
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:48,250
I think the idea of having wireless
Internet to a fucking cave man is so

1922
01:53:48,621 --> 01:53:49,490
ridiculous.

1923
01:53:49,910 --> 01:53:54,910
I don't think it's ridiculous to think
of some sort of a device other than a

1924
01:53:55,760 --> 01:53:59,160
lens and a glass thing
in the front and the,

1925
01:53:59,400 --> 01:54:04,070
the aperture and all the words that I
don't really understand that involve

1926
01:54:04,100 --> 01:54:08,660
making a photograph. Those. Those
words are all alien to me. Like if you,

1927
01:54:08,661 --> 01:54:10,820
if you,
if I didn't know there was a camera,

1928
01:54:10,821 --> 01:54:13,610
I'm way too fucking stupid to
have ever thought of a camera.

1929
01:54:13,670 --> 01:54:18,260
I would have to live a billion lives
by myself on an island to figure out a

1930
01:54:18,261 --> 01:54:21,080
fucking camera and I probably still
would never figured out a good camera.

1931
01:54:21,680 --> 01:54:25,980
Somebody figured out that shit.
Think about that man.

1932
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,930
When there's need,
it will be created in the future.

1933
01:54:28,931 --> 01:54:31,810
We're going to need to create force
fields to get these drugs out of our faces

1934
01:54:31,811 --> 01:54:33,750
and there microchips.
I think

1935
01:54:33,880 --> 01:54:35,520
there's,
I think there's a,

1936
01:54:35,570 --> 01:54:40,570
a crazy possibility for technological
innovation I think is it keeps getting

1937
01:54:42,070 --> 01:54:43,750
more and more sophisticated.

1938
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:48,400
I think it's going to reach a level
that we could not imagine right now.

1939
01:54:48,550 --> 01:54:51,610
Just like a cave person could
never imagine wireless video.

1940
01:54:51,940 --> 01:54:56,410
I think it's going to reach some
bizarre molecule, some, some, some,

1941
01:54:56,710 --> 01:55:01,710
some such a significantly small thing
that it would be like mist and then

1942
01:55:02,291 --> 01:55:07,291
instead of cameras it would like transmit
a three dimensional image of all the

1943
01:55:08,411 --> 01:55:10,300
air around it all the time.

1944
01:55:10,810 --> 01:55:14,140
And then you could live inside
that three dimensional image.

1945
01:55:14,170 --> 01:55:18,040
Like people could live in your life and
you wouldn't even know they were there

1946
01:55:18,041 --> 01:55:19,630
and they would be there all the time.

1947
01:55:20,810 --> 01:55:21,430
Yeah,

1948
01:55:21,430 --> 01:55:26,430
I think we're going to get to some
super fucking bizarre shit and about 200

1949
01:55:26,921 --> 01:55:30,670
years, I'm thinking about 200
fucking years of this keeping up.

1950
01:55:30,910 --> 01:55:35,910
We're going to get to some strange
place that's remarkably similar to what

1951
01:55:36,101 --> 01:55:37,960
happens when you take too much mushrooms,

1952
01:55:38,980 --> 01:55:43,980
some bizarre intertwining
lot electronically created
psychedelic dimension that

1953
01:55:48,721 --> 01:55:53,520
we'll be able to share information with
each other all the time, everywhere.

1954
01:55:53,521 --> 01:55:58,440
See each other and it's just
a few fucking decades away.

1955
01:55:58,830 --> 01:56:02,670
It's going to start a little creeps and
pops and we're just going to get double.

1956
01:56:02,671 --> 01:56:04,740
The world's gonna get weirder
and weirder and weirder,

1957
01:56:04,741 --> 01:56:07,950
weirder and more of these fucking
weird fucking smiley face drones.

1958
01:56:08,250 --> 01:56:09,083
What's that thing called,

1959
01:56:09,290 --> 01:56:13,200
lily? They're going to get smaller.
They're going to be, bugs are going to be,

1960
01:56:13,320 --> 01:56:17,610
birds are going to be little tiny things
that fly everywhere and everyone's just

1961
01:56:17,611 --> 01:56:21,060
going to have to concede to going to
have to concede that there's no privacy.

1962
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:25,300
Every time you get a scratch ticket, they
give you five drones. You walk outside,

1963
01:56:25,310 --> 01:56:29,190
you fucking throw him in the air. It's
ridiculous. The whole thing's ridiculous.

1964
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:30,510
We only eat gluten.

1965
01:56:32,430 --> 01:56:36,760
I don't think that's what you want a
drone to follow you around. Fuck No.

1966
01:56:36,761 --> 01:56:39,420
Why would like, why would,
why I didn't. I'm, I'm,

1967
01:56:40,110 --> 01:56:42,790
it's hard enough to process
the information I'm getting by

1968
01:56:42,820 --> 01:56:45,870
walking around. Right? Yeah.

1969
01:56:46,050 --> 01:56:49,650
It's hard enough to process that with
all the things that you do in your life.

1970
01:56:49,680 --> 01:56:53,880
How hard is it to process the information
that you get while you're walking

1971
01:56:53,881 --> 01:56:54,714
around?

1972
01:56:54,900 --> 01:56:56,190
It's fucking hard.
Right?

1973
01:56:56,460 --> 01:57:00,870
That's why we can watch it in replay
from our drone video. That's ridiculous.

1974
01:57:00,871 --> 01:57:03,870
Cause you watch that too and you're like,
oh my God, this is what it looked like.

1975
01:57:06,550 --> 01:57:10,350
That's why people start
fucking with their face, man.

1976
01:57:10,590 --> 01:57:13,200
You know when people started doing
crazy shit and plastic surgery,

1977
01:57:13,201 --> 01:57:14,090
they're trying to look

1978
01:57:14,130 --> 01:57:19,010
glass at themselves. As bizarre
as that seems, you know it's the,

1979
01:57:19,050 --> 01:57:21,020
the the, the, the idea of look,

1980
01:57:21,260 --> 01:57:26,260
looking at yourself like rationally
you want to look less at yourself,

1981
01:57:26,510 --> 01:57:31,510
you want to get more wrapped up in some
crazy little tiny aspect of who you are.

1982
01:57:32,211 --> 01:57:34,340
Fixed that and everything will be good.

1983
01:57:34,640 --> 01:57:37,010
You don't want to look at
yourself like as a whole,

1984
01:57:37,250 --> 01:57:41,180
as an entity and you're just
doing crazy Mickey Rourke,

1985
01:57:41,210 --> 01:57:43,550
your style. You can make a drone
follow you how long until they can,

1986
01:57:43,551 --> 01:57:45,530
you can make it fall to
someone else and like someone,

1987
01:57:45,531 --> 01:57:50,350
you just have a thousand
[inaudible] TMZ guys phone.

1988
01:57:50,390 --> 01:57:53,390
We can get to some point man.
It's not that far away. Far

1989
01:57:53,390 --> 01:57:54,980
Way where the,
the,

1990
01:57:55,210 --> 01:57:58,600
the idea of privacy is
going to be preposterous.

1991
01:57:59,860 --> 01:58:04,690
It's we, I think it's not that far
away. I don't know how many decades.

1992
01:58:04,691 --> 01:58:05,524
It is a way.

1993
01:58:05,530 --> 01:58:10,530
What it seems to me that if I looked at
what a cell phone looks like in 2015 and

1994
01:58:10,751 --> 01:58:14,260
it with what it looked like
in 1989 or whatever it was,

1995
01:58:14,261 --> 01:58:16,570
when people first started
getting car phones,

1996
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:20,770
remember they used to call them car
phones. That is not that long, man.

1997
01:58:20,980 --> 01:58:22,810
That's not that long in the world.

1998
01:58:23,270 --> 01:58:28,270
Just not in terms of like Tara doctorals
and snails and zebras and shit.

1999
01:58:29,740 --> 01:58:33,760
This is not that long as a little tiny
moment of time and something changed

2000
01:58:33,761 --> 01:58:38,410
radically. It's like everything
is worked slowly, slowly,

2001
01:58:38,411 --> 01:58:39,490
slowly,
slowly,

2002
01:58:39,491 --> 01:58:44,491
slowly slow over a genetic and biological
level until this one crazy fucking

2003
01:58:47,201 --> 01:58:51,850
monkey figured out how to make its
own life and decided to make its own

2004
01:58:51,851 --> 01:58:56,851
technological life and his
technological life changes rapidly,

2005
01:58:57,400 --> 01:58:58,151
rapidly,

2006
01:58:58,151 --> 01:59:03,151
just changes all the time constantly and
it has no regard whatsoever for little

2007
01:59:04,211 --> 01:59:08,140
tiny mice that you have to
feed your chickens. It doesn't
give a fuck about them.

2008
01:59:08,620 --> 01:59:13,620
It's just trying to change and get faster
and quicker and better all the time

2009
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:19,060
and that's what the Internet is and
that's what AI is and that's what these

2010
01:59:19,061 --> 01:59:23,200
fucking flying things
toss off a cliff are.

2011
01:59:23,590 --> 01:59:27,710
And what we are is the
apes clinging to the vines,

2012
01:59:27,780 --> 01:59:32,710
the shit slinking jungle
worried.

2013
01:59:32,920 --> 01:59:35,140
Oh my God, it's fucking
robots are going to take over.

2014
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:39,760
How horrible would it be if we
didn't take over from the monkeys?

2015
01:59:40,450 --> 01:59:41,380
Could you imagine?

2016
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:45,310
Could you imagine if every time you
wanted to go out to west Hollywood you had

2017
01:59:45,311 --> 01:59:48,720
to deal with gorillas kicking your ass.
Fucking your girl in front of you.

2018
01:59:48,750 --> 01:59:50,950
Gorilla racist. Yeah. Cute. Magically.

2019
01:59:50,951 --> 01:59:53,200
Gorillas hated people and
people hitting gorillas.

2020
01:59:53,230 --> 01:59:55,960
They were everywhere and there's
some sort of a protection thing.

2021
01:59:55,961 --> 02:00:00,370
We're trying to figure out how to work
this out. Come on son. We got lucky.

2022
02:00:01,690 --> 02:00:04,960
Lucky we got lucky. We
got to this point, right?

2023
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:09,520
I don't know.
My original point was sure it had one.

2024
02:00:10,430 --> 02:00:13,670
Do you see, did you get one of these
yet? Have you seen those in person yet?

2025
02:00:13,730 --> 02:00:16,980
The smart scooters.
These aren't like songs,

2026
02:00:17,270 --> 02:00:19,560
those, I saw a guy walking on
the street with one of those yet.

2027
02:00:19,930 --> 02:00:22,090
Yeah, I think I might
get one but it's, it's,

2028
02:00:22,091 --> 02:00:27,091
it's pretty much a very
inexpensive scooter that works
like a segue to the point

2029
02:00:28,131 --> 02:00:31,760
where if you don't it
just balances and you use

2030
02:00:31,810 --> 02:00:34,210
a um, uh, a remote control

2031
02:00:34,590 --> 02:00:37,330
look. See, here it is right
here is an action. Uh,

2032
02:00:37,600 --> 02:00:39,970
it pretty much just point

2033
02:00:40,310 --> 02:00:43,850
this thing. Charges fast only takes
a couple hours to fully charge.

2034
02:00:44,810 --> 02:00:47,420
So learning to ride the scooter
is actually really easy.

2035
02:00:47,690 --> 02:00:51,710
You just hit the power button, gently
step on the platform, one foot at a time.

2036
02:00:52,010 --> 02:00:56,120
These black rubber pads or like touch
sensitive buttons turning on the motors

2037
02:00:56,121 --> 02:01:00,680
when enough pressures applied using a
wall or person for support and practice

2038
02:01:00,681 --> 02:01:04,130
standing up straight. The key is
to just stay relaxed. Pro Tip,

2039
02:01:04,131 --> 02:01:07,670
push your feet to the edges against the
rent, which seems to help me balance.

2040
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:10,880
Then you can start leaning forwards
or backwards to move around.

2041
02:01:11,150 --> 02:01:15,350
And that's really it. It's so quick
and easy to learn. It's very intuitive.

2042
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:18,800
You just let your brain kind of think
about moving around and I'll automatically

2043
02:01:18,801 --> 02:01:19,634
do it for you.

2044
02:01:19,850 --> 02:01:23,120
I even had my little nine year old
niece learning to ride it and just a few

2045
02:01:23,121 --> 02:01:26,630
minutes and about 20 minutes
in my first time practicing,

2046
02:01:26,631 --> 02:01:27,890
I felt very comfortable.
Well,

2047
02:01:28,380 --> 02:01:32,090
I don't know why it's going up and down.
It can go up hills.

2048
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:36,390
You can feel the genre working underneath
your feet is very good and precise.

2049
02:01:36,391 --> 02:01:37,570
A lot of people in Hollywood are,

2050
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:42,270
are riding around on these and it looks
so goofy when you first see it and it,

2051
02:01:42,280 --> 02:01:43,670
cause people are like
going in stores with,

2052
02:01:43,671 --> 02:01:47,300
I saw somebody the other day at Panera
bread, just ordering was standing on one.

2053
02:01:47,410 --> 02:01:49,430
It's amazing.
It looks a little Porsche wheels.

2054
02:01:49,431 --> 02:01:53,930
I got Fukes and it will Fukes
wheels. Yeah. But it's cool.
It's like reverse Fukes.

2055
02:01:53,960 --> 02:01:57,670
There seems to be one manufacturer
or a generic manufacturer.

2056
02:01:57,680 --> 02:02:00,290
It and there all of these people are
rebranding it and selling under different

2057
02:02:00,291 --> 02:02:05,140
names, but there's also a few that
have better wheels and go faster, uh,

2058
02:02:05,150 --> 02:02:10,040
on it. Wow. But, uh, it's, it's, I
can see us all having these very soon.

2059
02:02:10,041 --> 02:02:11,440
Like what that kind of,
how we all thought that,

2060
02:02:11,660 --> 02:02:14,220
that the segway was going to
take off kind of, uh, you know,

2061
02:02:14,240 --> 02:02:16,010
they made sidewalks for segways.

2062
02:02:16,011 --> 02:02:19,880
This seemed a little bit more doable
as you can get one of these for $340 on

2063
02:02:19,881 --> 02:02:22,700
Amazon. Yeah. It's a skateboard,

2064
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:26,270
skateboard size segway that
balances brilliant. Yeah.

2065
02:02:26,380 --> 02:02:31,380
That's a perfect example of
like the difference between
a cell phone from 88 and

2066
02:02:31,411 --> 02:02:33,990
what we're putting in our pocket today.
Everybody.

2067
02:02:34,140 --> 02:02:37,620
Did you see that thing where there's
some hack that they can do on android

2068
02:02:37,621 --> 02:02:40,350
phones? Well, you just
have to send you a text.

2069
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:41,350
What did you,
yeah.

2070
02:02:42,130 --> 02:02:46,240
Did you see the hack that the jeep had
to recall all their cars because people

2071
02:02:46,241 --> 02:02:50,710
could, can control the breaks, the sound,
troll the fucking car and shut it off.

2072
02:02:50,711 --> 02:02:54,140
Like we used to always talk about,
now it's actually happening. Whoa,

2073
02:02:54,280 --> 02:02:55,330
here's the article.
Right?

2074
02:02:57,690 --> 02:03:02,140
Porque see for Real, how long does
it take before unrecognizable?

2075
02:03:02,770 --> 02:03:07,770
How long does it take before human beings
become some super bizarre robot hybrid

2076
02:03:09,490 --> 02:03:11,260
that drives cars with his brain?

2077
02:03:12,340 --> 02:03:17,070
How long is it a week?
Is it a year into the,

2078
02:03:17,440 --> 02:03:18,400
is it a decade?

2079
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:20,910
Yeah. Here it is. Uh, this is the,

2080
02:03:21,150 --> 02:03:24,030
the hack that led to the huge jeep.

2081
02:03:24,790 --> 02:03:28,740
All right. [inaudible]
um, well all these cars,

2082
02:03:28,770 --> 02:03:33,770
every car that has antilock brakes and
every car that has all this traction

2083
02:03:33,910 --> 02:03:37,890
control, a lot of that stuff
is electronically managed.

2084
02:03:38,250 --> 02:03:41,700
Traction control is a,
a big issue with cars.

2085
02:03:41,760 --> 02:03:44,760
They want to make cars
safer and easier to handle.

2086
02:03:44,761 --> 02:03:48,350
If one of the wheels start
skidding, they, it comes in and uh,

2087
02:03:48,420 --> 02:03:51,030
motor enthusiasts like guys
who are like race car drivers,

2088
02:03:51,031 --> 02:03:53,940
like a Chris Harris or
something like that. They, they,

2089
02:03:53,970 --> 02:03:57,900
they would call it like nanny devices.
Like, like, like nanny controls.

2090
02:03:57,930 --> 02:04:00,270
They don't want that because they
know how to drive really good.

2091
02:04:00,540 --> 02:04:02,490
But the most of us,
me included,

2092
02:04:02,790 --> 02:04:06,720
don't drive so fucking good and your
wheels start skidding out from back behind

2093
02:04:06,721 --> 02:04:09,990
you. I don't know exactly what to do. I
know a little bit from driving in snow,

2094
02:04:10,230 --> 02:04:13,770
but not like a matte fairer one of
these fucking dudes who drives cars like

2095
02:04:13,771 --> 02:04:17,760
professionally. That's where that
kind of electronic shit comes in.

2096
02:04:18,780 --> 02:04:19,650
That's what this thing is.

2097
02:04:19,940 --> 02:04:23,550
One and 1.4 million fiats uh,

2098
02:04:23,570 --> 02:04:27,560
they that during the test hackers were
able to exploit to kill the engine,

2099
02:04:27,740 --> 02:04:32,510
disabled the brakes and track the location
of it so they could track. You know,

2100
02:04:32,511 --> 02:04:34,970
when you're going around a corner
on a bridge and take off your brain,

2101
02:04:35,240 --> 02:04:36,860
it only makes sense because if you have a,

2102
02:04:37,620 --> 02:04:42,000
and that car has like satellite
gps and all that jazz, you,

2103
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:44,130
you have to understand that,

2104
02:04:44,131 --> 02:04:49,131
that that car is being somehow or
another connected from a computer with an

2105
02:04:49,531 --> 02:04:53,520
Internet connection or some sort of a gps
connection that goes up to a satellite

2106
02:04:53,850 --> 02:04:57,840
and it's following you. That's how it
knows where you are when your, you know,

2107
02:04:57,841 --> 02:05:01,080
it's,
it's telling you turn right in 200 yards.

2108
02:05:01,710 --> 02:05:04,260
It's telling you that because
it's connected to something,

2109
02:05:04,780 --> 02:05:09,180
it's something knows where it is.
Right? It's figuring this out.

2110
02:05:09,181 --> 02:05:13,050
It's getting it from the GPS.
There's a satellite this tracking you.

2111
02:05:13,410 --> 02:05:17,070
It's so strange when you
think about what that is,

2112
02:05:17,330 --> 02:05:20,750
is that he's like,
I was driving 70 miles per hour out.

2113
02:05:20,751 --> 02:05:21,860
What the fuck just happened here?

2114
02:05:22,070 --> 02:05:25,670
I was driving 70 miles per hour on the
edge of downtown St Louis though I didn't

2115
02:05:25,671 --> 02:05:26,720
touch the dashboard.

2116
02:05:26,750 --> 02:05:30,230
The vents in the jeep Cherokee
started blasting cold air at maximum,

2117
02:05:30,410 --> 02:05:33,380
showing a sweat on my back
through the seat climate control.

2118
02:05:33,500 --> 02:05:37,730
Next switched the radio station to the
local hip hop station and blaring skee Lo

2119
02:05:37,731 --> 02:05:39,560
at full volume.
He didn't touch anything.

2120
02:05:39,561 --> 02:05:43,620
So some hackers were taking over his
car while he's in it and then, uh,

2121
02:05:43,730 --> 02:05:47,070
killed it on the middle of the
highway going 70 miles an hour. I,

2122
02:05:47,270 --> 02:05:51,110
I read a little bit this just like a test.
It's like a special test they had.

2123
02:05:51,111 --> 02:05:54,530
They installed something special inside
of it so that they could connect to it

2124
02:05:54,890 --> 02:05:57,770
also, it wasn't, oh, it was like
a random of, oh wait a minute.

2125
02:05:57,800 --> 02:05:59,960
So this couldn't happen with a jeep.

2126
02:05:59,961 --> 02:06:03,500
That's a regular GFE off a lot
unless someone went to that jeep,

2127
02:06:03,570 --> 02:06:07,040
installed this extra thing here.
Well, what does that extra thing?

2128
02:06:07,660 --> 02:06:10,770
Thumb drive probably that you
can just plug into the USB.

2129
02:06:11,220 --> 02:06:15,090
You know I have thumb drives him all my
stuff that know what the fuck does off

2130
02:06:15,210 --> 02:06:17,110
to the thumb drives are in that console.

2131
02:06:17,111 --> 02:06:21,220
You don't see them stick in there and
it probably is just uploading it to it.

2132
02:06:22,150 --> 02:06:26,070
So the thumb drive but, but
it's, see I don't know anything.

2133
02:06:26,390 --> 02:06:28,180
And I was going to say
enough about computers.

2134
02:06:28,480 --> 02:06:32,740
I don't know anything about computers.
But if you stuck a thumb drive into a car,

2135
02:06:32,920 --> 02:06:35,310
he couldn't.
Could it automatically access to

2136
02:06:35,540 --> 02:06:38,570
you drove your car?
Here's my what mine does in my f my edge.

2137
02:06:38,780 --> 02:06:42,230
I plug it in and then it goes, would you
like to a software update? And I'm like,

2138
02:06:42,231 --> 02:06:44,180
yes.
And it just hit yes.

2139
02:06:44,240 --> 02:06:47,870
Then updates my software in it using
something I downloaded off the internet

2140
02:06:47,871 --> 02:06:51,980
onto a thumb drive. Oh Wow. So this is,

2141
02:06:52,010 --> 02:06:55,550
these are the guys and this is actually
them showing them how it's done. Uh,

2142
02:06:55,660 --> 02:06:57,980
the audio is up. I don't know
why it's not playing any audio,

2143
02:06:57,981 --> 02:07:02,540
but Charlie's house miles away.
They wouldn't tell me what they had plans,

2144
02:07:02,750 --> 02:07:06,140
but they assured me that it wouldn't be
anything life threatening. Remember Andy,

2145
02:07:06,141 --> 02:07:08,600
no matter what happens,
don't panic.

2146
02:07:08,970 --> 02:07:12,060
It's not the first time I'd driven a car
while it's being attacked by these two

2147
02:07:12,061 --> 02:07:12,894
hackers.

2148
02:07:13,080 --> 02:07:17,370
But in 2013 they were in the back seat
and the laptops were wired into the

2149
02:07:17,371 --> 02:07:20,000
vehicle to report. In fact, oh my.

2150
02:07:20,310 --> 02:07:23,760
Now they're sending the same sort of
attacks remotely and I have no idea what

2151
02:07:23,761 --> 02:07:24,594
they might do

2152
02:07:25,190 --> 02:07:28,710
going as fast as I've seen him. So. So
first we're going to turn the fan on them.

2153
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:30,780
Yeah, let's turn the
fan on. TV even notices.

2154
02:07:33,220 --> 02:07:37,810
All right. All the something just turned
on. All the fans and AC and stuff.

2155
02:07:38,140 --> 02:07:42,130
I didn't do that. The trick
is started small. Oh my God.

2156
02:07:42,700 --> 02:07:45,760
That was a picture of Charlie
and Chris and tracksuits.

2157
02:07:47,690 --> 02:07:49,480
But as I drove down the interstate,

2158
02:07:49,540 --> 02:07:53,110
things started getting
unpleasant and very loud.

2159
02:07:57,430 --> 02:07:58,630
Oh my God.

2160
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:04,793
Videos.

2161
02:08:06,750 --> 02:08:11,750
Leann shinny slash brain is windshield
washer fluid and I can't see any need to

2162
02:08:13,430 --> 02:08:17,060
get to the windshield wiper
fluid. I mean, I do it.

2163
02:08:17,890 --> 02:08:21,520
Do it, kill the engine. It was
killing the engine right now.

2164
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:27,030
That part that says, oh my God,
they killed it on the highway.

2165
02:08:27,510 --> 02:08:28,343
The calories.

2166
02:08:28,470 --> 02:08:31,260
I stomped on the gas,
but the jeep slowed to a crawl.

2167
02:08:31,290 --> 02:08:33,660
What if the car behind them
just in rear those tower,

2168
02:08:33,740 --> 02:08:36,600
but I turned on my hazard lights,

2169
02:08:36,690 --> 02:08:39,750
but I was still stuck in the right
lane with no shoulder to escape on

2170
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:42,990
two guys.
Thug on the highway.

2171
02:08:43,790 --> 02:08:48,120
Oh, I think he's panicking. He's not
going to hear us with that radio so loud.

2172
02:08:49,050 --> 02:08:52,440
He's a big guy.
Big salary to go work again.

2173
02:08:53,860 --> 02:08:57,580
The accelerator. We'll work.
It won't work. You're doing

2174
02:08:58,130 --> 02:09:00,410
seriously dangerous.
I need to do

2175
02:09:01,010 --> 02:09:05,570
you gotta turn the car off. Okay.
Now you should be good to go,

2176
02:09:08,380 --> 02:09:10,090
Sam.
I drove by.

2177
02:09:10,460 --> 02:09:15,170
Okay, but that man, what if you were
behind them when that happened? Oh,

2178
02:09:15,171 --> 02:09:16,520
I know what if that's
what I was going to say.

2179
02:09:16,521 --> 02:09:20,860
That seemed very dangerous for them
to do that real [inaudible] front of

2180
02:09:20,870 --> 02:09:21,770
wired.com.

2181
02:09:21,870 --> 02:09:25,830
Yeah, but you're the best at figuring out
that. That's totally real. Yeah. Jamie,

2182
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:26,670
Jamie's.
Kevin,

2183
02:09:26,670 --> 02:09:28,090
you're going to be,
I mean it could be a,

2184
02:09:28,160 --> 02:09:32,820
we wired would not put it on there
wired. They can let you get duped. Yeah,

2185
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:35,520
wired legit went to
hear him talk my route.

2186
02:09:35,660 --> 02:09:40,430
No, no, that's cool. I get it. I
believe it. It's just how the fuck.

2187
02:09:40,660 --> 02:09:44,180
Yeah, it's scary. They shouldn't do
that. No, definitely shouldn't do that.

2188
02:09:44,420 --> 02:09:47,480
If you're going to do that, you should do
that on a track. You shouldn't do that.

2189
02:09:47,750 --> 02:09:51,080
If you want to prove it, prove it on a
track. Donald don't prove it like that.

2190
02:09:51,110 --> 02:09:54,620
That's crazy. Yeah. I don't know if they
really did that. If they really did that,

2191
02:09:54,621 --> 02:09:56,090
that seems to me to be unnecessary.

2192
02:09:56,330 --> 02:10:00,290
All you'd have to do is take people on
a track and have them drive around in a

2193
02:10:00,291 --> 02:10:03,350
controlled environment and do the same
thing and everybody would freak out.

2194
02:10:03,800 --> 02:10:04,970
You wouldn't have to do this.

2195
02:10:05,040 --> 02:10:06,990
Yeah. Not on the highway
where there's no shorter.

2196
02:10:06,991 --> 02:10:10,350
I think it was the people not knowing
that there wasn't a shoulder and so you

2197
02:10:10,351 --> 02:10:11,030
know well

2198
02:10:11,030 --> 02:10:14,570
also like, like what if it
was in the left lane. I mean,

2199
02:10:14,571 --> 02:10:16,670
maybe they made an agreement
to only stay in the right lane,

2200
02:10:17,150 --> 02:10:19,640
but if you were stuck out there
and someone didn't pay attention,

2201
02:10:19,641 --> 02:10:21,920
they were coming up behind you fast.
They couldn't hit the brakes.

2202
02:10:21,940 --> 02:10:25,100
[inaudible] Fuck Jenner. Fuck yeah. Yeah.

2203
02:10:26,230 --> 02:10:30,710
Back when Caitlin was,
Bruce sounds like a novel,

2204
02:10:32,090 --> 02:10:36,620
but a back when was still a
identified as Bruce. She, uh,

2205
02:10:36,770 --> 02:10:41,180
slammed into a car and pushed that
car into oncoming traffic. Apparently.

2206
02:10:42,590 --> 02:10:45,530
Fuck.
It's too easy to get in car accidents.

2207
02:10:46,100 --> 02:10:49,550
The idea that any person just not
paying attention for a brief moment,

2208
02:10:50,010 --> 02:10:53,390
Katie accidentally hit something. You
know, it's like what we're talking about.

2209
02:10:53,391 --> 02:10:54,950
If you just took your whole life,

2210
02:10:54,951 --> 02:10:58,010
have you accidentally bumping
into shit and you added it all up

2211
02:10:59,780 --> 02:11:04,760
to give anybody the ability to drive at
whatever speed they would like based on

2212
02:11:04,761 --> 02:11:08,510
how hard they push the right pedal and
make sure they hit the breaks on time.

2213
02:11:08,570 --> 02:11:12,590
It is remarkable how few crashes
there are. It's fucking remarkable.

2214
02:11:12,950 --> 02:11:14,990
It's remarkable how well
people keep it together.

2215
02:11:15,560 --> 02:11:19,130
If we see one accident on the
highway at a 20 million people in la,

2216
02:11:19,131 --> 02:11:20,300
we go fucking idiot.

2217
02:11:20,330 --> 02:11:24,310
The one on one should be accidents
all day long, every day, all day.

2218
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:29,800
Be Cons to meet explosions or fire.

2219
02:11:30,770 --> 02:11:34,550
If we were really the ogres that we would
like to perceive ourselves as being,

2220
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:38,360
I just fucking smashed into
each other while jerking off.

2221
02:11:39,710 --> 02:11:43,190
I don't think it's that
bad. Yeah man. I'm fucking,

2222
02:11:44,540 --> 02:11:49,430
I'm positive she hear that Twitter's
or racing stolen jokes. Yeah.

2223
02:11:49,431 --> 02:11:52,490
I thought that was interesting
because, um, how do they determine,

2224
02:11:52,550 --> 02:11:55,230
is it publishing who published it
first or who put it on Twitter,

2225
02:11:55,850 --> 02:11:58,880
Twitter doing it on its own system.

2226
02:11:58,881 --> 02:12:02,810
Here's the Twitter is erasing store and
jokes and they're putting up actual like,

2227
02:12:02,811 --> 02:12:07,400
you know, this uh, tweet has
been copywritten or, hmm.

2228
02:12:07,820 --> 02:12:11,150
Uh, well here's the thing, man. I,

2229
02:12:11,680 --> 02:12:16,460
I totally support it if it was accurate
all the time as far as like who was the

2230
02:12:16,461 --> 02:12:17,600
original creator of it.

2231
02:12:17,601 --> 02:12:21,560
But sometimes it seems like the history
of that stuff was too hard to track down.

2232
02:12:21,680 --> 02:12:25,220
The article says they have a team of
people inside their acts inside Twitter

2233
02:12:25,221 --> 02:12:29,540
looking at each case. Okay. So they look
at it and then they make a determination.

2234
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:32,270
It matter. I guess I'll go what
happened on youtube or anywhere else?

2235
02:12:32,271 --> 02:12:34,340
You might have copyright issues.
Does that make sense?

2236
02:12:34,430 --> 02:12:38,060
Have you ever thought of something and
you thought, ah man, this is awesome,

2237
02:12:38,090 --> 02:12:41,360
but you realize that somebody else had
already thought of it a hundred times

2238
02:12:41,361 --> 02:12:44,310
like that. The thing is that,
that what makes me mad is this,

2239
02:12:44,390 --> 02:12:48,410
this one person who's saying that
she writes jokes for a living.

2240
02:12:48,950 --> 02:12:52,460
She feel Tess's jokes on Twitter
and stuff, but you know that,

2241
02:12:52,520 --> 02:12:57,230
so she says a joke that she thinks
that she wrote, but you know,

2242
02:12:57,231 --> 02:13:00,830
you see like lethal weapon two and they
use the same joke and then lethal weapon

2243
02:13:00,831 --> 02:13:04,490
two and you're like, oh fuck. But she,
oh, you know who says is who? I mean,

2244
02:13:04,491 --> 02:13:09,370
that seems like, I dunno,
but it is Twitter. Who gives
a fuck, you know? Oh No,

2245
02:13:09,440 --> 02:13:11,300
they deleted.
It is annoying.

2246
02:13:11,301 --> 02:13:14,360
Like if you wrote something that was
really hilarious about something,

2247
02:13:14,361 --> 02:13:19,361
it was like a particular red band asked
take on something and it was hilarious

2248
02:13:19,731 --> 02:13:20,890
and you put it on Twitter
or anything and it

2249
02:13:20,900 --> 02:13:25,890
got like all these retweets and
people are lol, lol, lol, lol, lol,

2250
02:13:25,891 --> 02:13:30,240
lol. Yeah. And with any saw, a bunch
of other people read like just took it.

2251
02:13:30,300 --> 02:13:32,040
They didn't retweet,
they just took it and put

2252
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:35,580
it on their Twitter feed. He'd
been like, ah, why did you do that?

2253
02:13:36,060 --> 02:13:38,610
But sometimes you both
think of the same shit.

2254
02:13:38,750 --> 02:13:41,780
Yeah, that's possible too. It happens
more and more. It's, it's weird,

2255
02:13:42,020 --> 02:13:45,290
especially watching old movies they
grew up with, you know, and and going,

2256
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:46,190
Oh my God,

2257
02:13:46,190 --> 02:13:49,580
that joke that I thought of the other
day was just because there was this one

2258
02:13:49,581 --> 02:13:54,581
part and this one obscure Steve Martin
movie from the 70s that I liked and it

2259
02:13:55,071 --> 02:13:58,340
was just a weird variation of that and
I didn't even realize it. I was like,

2260
02:13:58,341 --> 02:14:01,310
Holy Shit, I'm looking at their
act, the form on their website.

2261
02:14:01,520 --> 02:14:03,620
It's very similar to how it
happens on Youtube. Really.

2262
02:14:03,621 --> 02:14:04,490
All they're saying is like,

2263
02:14:04,491 --> 02:14:06,890
if you're willing to say that
this is a copyright infringement,

2264
02:14:07,450 --> 02:14:10,580
you have to be willing to
go to court for it. So,

2265
02:14:10,650 --> 02:14:14,840
and then Twitter's getting their
hands out of the, out of the horny.

2266
02:14:14,841 --> 02:14:16,190
So they're just saying like here's,

2267
02:14:16,400 --> 02:14:18,950
so if someone's willing to go to
court for it, then they pull it.

2268
02:14:19,220 --> 02:14:21,350
It says by like when you fill
out the thing, you have to,

2269
02:14:21,351 --> 02:14:24,500
I understand that under
17 USC section five, 12,

2270
02:14:24,501 --> 02:14:28,670
I am liable for any damages including
costs and attorney fees if I had knowingly

2271
02:14:28,671 --> 02:14:32,360
materially misrepresent that I reported
material or activity that is infringing.

2272
02:14:33,170 --> 02:14:34,460
See the problem is

2273
02:14:35,470 --> 02:14:38,230
parallel thinking is so common amongst,

2274
02:14:38,231 --> 02:14:41,530
especially amongst like
current events subjects.

2275
02:14:42,160 --> 02:14:46,690
Like there was a funny story that are
used to tell cause at the time this was

2276
02:14:46,691 --> 02:14:48,190
like 19,

2277
02:14:49,390 --> 02:14:52,450
it was either 1990,

2278
02:14:53,260 --> 02:14:58,260
1999 or 2000 when that
Chinese aircraft with a,

2279
02:14:58,361 --> 02:14:59,400
there was like a uh,

2280
02:14:59,850 --> 02:15:04,000
a collision or something between an
American and Chinese aircraft and the

2281
02:15:04,001 --> 02:15:08,800
Chinese aircraft was flown by guy
named Wong Way. Oh yeah, that's right.

2282
02:15:08,930 --> 02:15:12,760
I remember that. I was like
five years ago probably. No,
no, no, no, no, it was, it was,

2283
02:15:12,820 --> 02:15:16,210
it was 2000 because it was when I did my,
uh,

2284
02:15:16,240 --> 02:15:18,520
belly from the beast DVD from Texas.

2285
02:15:19,120 --> 02:15:23,320
And I remember like I talked about
it like I might've been, it might've,

2286
02:15:23,321 --> 02:15:26,860
I might've had it on that bit
or my on that special if it not,

2287
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:29,080
it was in that time,
it was around that time.

2288
02:15:29,260 --> 02:15:32,860
But Ari was working in the cover booth
at the time and Ari was like the audience

2289
02:15:32,861 --> 02:15:35,890
after like five hours of Comedians,
it's like, what is this a fucking joke?

2290
02:15:36,030 --> 02:15:38,890
Like you just all did the same
joke over and over and over again.

2291
02:15:39,460 --> 02:15:42,930
And the guy's name was Wong way,
you know.

2292
02:15:42,931 --> 02:15:46,930
So we would all show up
like five or six guys,

2293
02:15:46,931 --> 02:15:48,910
Dave and you know how the store works.

2294
02:15:48,920 --> 02:15:50,760
Nobody pays attention to
anybody that's on before him.

2295
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:54,520
You're in the back hanging out having
laughs and the guys on stage and he's

2296
02:15:54,521 --> 02:15:57,610
saying the same fucking joke.
She just said to him [inaudible]

2297
02:15:58,540 --> 02:16:00,940
as you can figure it out also
because you'll be on stage,

2298
02:16:00,941 --> 02:16:05,920
like I know that usually at least gets
a reaction and then you find out that Oh

2299
02:16:05,921 --> 02:16:09,850
yeah. To, you know, to other people
talked about boner pills or at least,

2300
02:16:10,120 --> 02:16:11,660
yeah, there's certain subjects. Yeah.

2301
02:16:11,740 --> 02:16:15,040
Well that was what we were talking
about before about stepping on stuff.

2302
02:16:15,690 --> 02:16:19,450
What are you going in there for? Yeah,
Coca Cola, Coca Cola, golf. Hello.

2303
02:16:20,380 --> 02:16:23,890
Stepping on something. One of our friends
had a, an issue with that recently,

2304
02:16:23,950 --> 02:16:27,910
or actually two friends, two different
friends in two different occasions.

2305
02:16:27,911 --> 02:16:30,250
Worked at comedy clubs and um,

2306
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:34,900
they work with these local guys and
like say they did Thursday, Friday,

2307
02:16:34,900 --> 02:16:35,710
Saturday or something like that.

2308
02:16:35,710 --> 02:16:38,970
They do the Thursday with
the local guy and then on,

2309
02:16:39,370 --> 02:16:40,660
on Friday when they would come in,

2310
02:16:40,870 --> 02:16:44,740
they would do all the local
guy would do all their jokes,

2311
02:16:45,220 --> 02:16:47,380
but a version of them.
So like I said,

2312
02:16:47,410 --> 02:16:50,230
if you had a joke about Burrito's
I fucking love burritos.

2313
02:16:50,320 --> 02:16:52,900
That was like a big part of
your act. Well, I'll tell
you what, I'm Jamie Verdun.

2314
02:16:53,080 --> 02:16:56,440
I fucking love Burritos and he just
kept going on about that. Right.

2315
02:16:56,680 --> 02:16:59,890
They would just circumvent
that and they would,

2316
02:17:00,550 --> 02:17:03,880
they would make it so that they would
do some sort of a weak ass joke about

2317
02:17:03,881 --> 02:17:07,630
burritos. So then when you would go
up and do your joke about Burritos,

2318
02:17:07,870 --> 02:17:10,180
20% of the air would be
left out of the sales.

2319
02:17:10,181 --> 02:17:12,840
This is a shitty example cause
burritos is very rare for her.

2320
02:17:12,940 --> 02:17:15,170
I just had to happen to me,
Joe, I just had to have,

2321
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:19,020
I had it where the guy was even said,
I'm just turned 41 man.

2322
02:17:19,021 --> 02:17:22,410
I like eating ass now I tell you. And
I'm like, I'm about to go on stage.

2323
02:17:22,440 --> 02:17:26,160
And that's the first thing I'm saying,
it's about gym. I'm telling you,

2324
02:17:26,310 --> 02:17:29,280
just cock blocked her own
self. Jesus Christ. Listen,

2325
02:17:29,281 --> 02:17:32,190
put your headphones on so you listen
to what you said. It doesn't matter.

2326
02:17:34,000 --> 02:17:37,740
We'll Diaz had it happened to two.
It happens man. It's fucking stupid.

2327
02:17:38,380 --> 02:17:41,220
Yo. The young guys that do
it, I know what they're doing.

2328
02:17:41,221 --> 02:17:45,390
They're just trying to get ahead.
They're trying to do well, but it's a,

2329
02:17:45,400 --> 02:17:47,790
it's one of the worst ways you
could ever work with somebody.

2330
02:17:47,910 --> 02:17:51,090
So it's such a short sighted way
of thinking about things too.

2331
02:17:51,540 --> 02:17:55,640
You gotta circumvent and
sabotage their act. That's why
you do it. Right. You know,

2332
02:17:55,641 --> 02:17:58,770
you always bring everybody you know on
the road and so you don't have to deal

2333
02:17:58,771 --> 02:18:01,830
with that shit ever. Well, do it
right there too, because also,

2334
02:18:01,831 --> 02:18:05,640
I know that's going to be an awesome show.
Like we've got a show in Austin,

2335
02:18:05,641 --> 02:18:09,300
Texas on August 29th Ian
Edwards, Joey Diaz in me. Wow.

2336
02:18:10,290 --> 02:18:12,480
Bet The house.
Even if I suck

2337
02:18:14,350 --> 02:18:18,280
in Edwards and Joey Diaz
are two motherfuckers.

2338
02:18:18,360 --> 02:18:22,290
That is insane show.
Those guys are good man.

2339
02:18:22,600 --> 02:18:26,640
Ian Is fucking funny. I love and it's
great. I just watched him the other day.

2340
02:18:26,700 --> 02:18:28,980
He's like,
I never watched comedy,

2341
02:18:28,981 --> 02:18:31,170
but I really sat down and
watched his set the other day.

2342
02:18:31,171 --> 02:18:35,640
I laughed harder than I've laughed
in awhile. He's a good dude too, man.

2343
02:18:35,850 --> 02:18:38,070
Thing about Ian.
He's a really good dude.

2344
02:18:38,310 --> 02:18:43,020
He's just like calm and smooth and
friendly, you know, great stage presence.

2345
02:18:43,050 --> 02:18:44,760
Oh my God. Dude, he murders it.

2346
02:18:44,850 --> 02:18:47,490
I don't want to do any of his bits
because I don't want to ruin it for you.

2347
02:18:47,820 --> 02:18:50,850
But some of his bits are so smooth.
He just like halfway into the bit,

2348
02:18:50,851 --> 02:18:51,830
you close your eyes like,

2349
02:18:51,950 --> 02:18:53,720
ah,

2350
02:18:54,140 --> 02:18:58,550
as a punchline hits you like
a wave of Oh shit. Oh Shit.

2351
02:18:58,820 --> 02:19:00,800
Oh no, he didn't. Uh,

2352
02:19:03,320 --> 02:19:06,020
he's so different. I love,
well, I've known him forever.

2353
02:19:06,320 --> 02:19:10,280
I've been friends with Ian's. It's
like, um, I, uh, I started in the 88,

2354
02:19:10,281 --> 02:19:14,000
I think I came to New York in [inaudible]
91, somewhere around there and that's,

2355
02:19:14,360 --> 02:19:17,480
I met Ian somewhere around them.
He's always been the same dude,

2356
02:19:18,800 --> 02:19:21,060
always been super cool.
It's just like somewhere along the line,

2357
02:19:21,061 --> 02:19:26,030
I know he figured out how to just become
so funny. He just started nailing it.

2358
02:19:26,810 --> 02:19:28,130
And like,
especially

2359
02:19:28,130 --> 02:19:30,800
in La, uh, he's one of those
dudes, like if he's onstage,

2360
02:19:30,950 --> 02:19:34,400
I make a point to go see him.
I'm always make a point to go see Ian.

2361
02:19:34,790 --> 02:19:39,770
He's always got some new shit and halfway
into his new shit. You going, ah, ah, ah,

2362
02:19:39,830 --> 02:19:44,210
no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh No, you didn't.

2363
02:19:44,690 --> 02:19:45,523
He's funny.
Yeah.

2364
02:19:45,590 --> 02:19:49,940
Do you know a, a guy named Dan Saint
Germain? Have you ever heard of him? No,

2365
02:19:49,941 --> 02:19:54,320
I think so. Where's it from? Uh, I
think he's from here. He lives here.

2366
02:19:54,680 --> 02:19:57,140
I am. I know him by face.
I might not know his name.

2367
02:19:57,290 --> 02:20:01,820
I had on my secret or a comedy show
the other day and he destroyed like,

2368
02:20:01,970 --> 02:20:05,270
I've never seen somebody destroy.
He seems like one of those guys,

2369
02:20:05,390 --> 02:20:09,290
it was hot and he had a jacket on
and he has a full beard and he just,

2370
02:20:09,610 --> 02:20:12,230
and he destroyed like,
and he,

2371
02:20:12,360 --> 02:20:15,380
he felt like he was
closing the whole time.

2372
02:20:15,610 --> 02:20:17,980
And this dude before I
definitely slipped high.

2373
02:20:18,060 --> 02:20:20,690
We should get them on the [inaudible].
He's hilarious guys.

2374
02:20:20,780 --> 02:20:24,560
Listen man, that's beautiful.
That's beautiful. Love that guy.

2375
02:20:25,130 --> 02:20:26,930
We're always going to have these guys.
They're always going to,

2376
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:29,330
they're not going to stop.
They're going to be more now.

2377
02:20:29,331 --> 02:20:31,850
There's going to be more than,
I think there's more to that.

2378
02:20:31,880 --> 02:20:34,770
Like I was having this conversation
with Diaz and with, uh,

2379
02:20:34,820 --> 02:20:37,370
Adam from the comedy
store and we were like,

2380
02:20:37,610 --> 02:20:42,610
I go when I look around guys
like [inaudible] and Chris
Rock and Dave Chappelle

2381
02:20:43,521 --> 02:20:48,230
and Louis C K and I just,
and Diaz and uh,

2382
02:20:48,260 --> 02:20:52,730
Dunkin and Ari and Jim Jeffries.
And I am like,

2383
02:20:52,731 --> 02:20:56,390
fuck man,
this is my favorite comedy era ever.

2384
02:20:56,600 --> 02:20:59,450
This is my favorite as far
as like the shit that I like.

2385
02:21:00,020 --> 02:21:04,490
Like this is my favorite. I could
listen to these guys forever as a comic.

2386
02:21:05,110 --> 02:21:06,050
Um,
you know,

2387
02:21:06,200 --> 02:21:11,200
we're a part of this weird new
sort of next level of comedy.

2388
02:21:11,930 --> 02:21:15,980
There's a lot of like amazing
artists that are popping up now. Man,

2389
02:21:16,130 --> 02:21:19,490
there's a lot of really fucking
funny people that are popping up now.

2390
02:21:19,910 --> 02:21:22,640
Thompson Gora is funny as fuck dude.

2391
02:21:23,120 --> 02:21:28,120
I had him on the Ice House show two weeks
ago and he was discharged Roy Yang in

2392
02:21:29,001 --> 02:21:30,770
the back of the room at one point in time.
I was like,

2393
02:21:31,100 --> 02:21:35,650
I remember meeting Tom on that. Eddie,
uh, excuse me, Charlie Murphy, uh,

2394
02:21:35,750 --> 02:21:40,750
John Heffron Gig that I did in Phoenix
and he was so composed and it's so

2395
02:21:40,881 --> 02:21:44,870
smooth. Yeah. The real minute comedy
tour. So smooth. And I remember thinking,

2396
02:21:44,871 --> 02:21:47,000
Holy Shit,
this guy is fucking funny.

2397
02:21:47,090 --> 02:21:50,690
But that was like 2005 or something
like that or whatever the hell it was.

2398
02:21:50,691 --> 02:21:54,800
Or six when you look at
this like w who he is now,

2399
02:21:54,890 --> 02:21:59,720
God damn dude, he's, he's a machine.

2400
02:22:00,290 --> 02:22:02,120
He's up there killing the
other night I was like,

2401
02:22:02,121 --> 02:22:07,121
Holy Fuck Thompson girls on another level,

2402
02:22:07,461 --> 02:22:08,294
man.

2403
02:22:08,590 --> 02:22:11,990
What, what is it? Cause it
seems like he really found,

2404
02:22:12,110 --> 02:22:16,610
he really found his voice
quick. Like I, it seems like,
uh, I've known him, you know,

2405
02:22:16,700 --> 02:22:19,370
maybe eight years,
nine years or whatever,

2406
02:22:19,371 --> 02:22:22,280
and I met him in San Francisco or I
actually had met him on the tour also.

2407
02:22:22,610 --> 02:22:26,250
But it seems like recently
he's just in a whole different

2408
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:26,831
level.
It's,

2409
02:22:26,831 --> 02:22:30,600
it's so interesting seeing comics go
like up a level in front of your eyes.

2410
02:22:30,601 --> 02:22:35,020
Like Ari did that Ari, I saw Ari special
and it's probably one of the I, I,

2411
02:22:35,180 --> 02:22:39,240
I was amazed. I was like, I can't believe
you did that. Like that was perfect.

2412
02:22:39,390 --> 02:22:43,080
I hadn't seen him in two years ago.
He, he got that different in two years,

2413
02:22:43,130 --> 02:22:48,000
you just kept working and kept pushing.
It's amazing. It's amazing to watch,

2414
02:22:48,060 --> 02:22:50,800
you know, even though you know it's going
to happen again every time it happens.

2415
02:22:51,210 --> 02:22:55,740
It's like if you were watching a flower
and you watched it every day and you

2416
02:22:55,741 --> 02:23:00,741
slowly got used to the fact that it's
slowly opening up at at a certain point in

2417
02:23:00,871 --> 02:23:04,590
time, you walk by that same spot and
you see that flower and you go, Oh shit.

2418
02:23:04,890 --> 02:23:07,630
Meanwhile, am I calling Aria Flower? Yes.

2419
02:23:08,650 --> 02:23:13,020
My beautiful chew flower.
He,

2420
02:23:13,021 --> 02:23:16,350
I'm just figured it out, man.
He's a smart dude. You know,

2421
02:23:16,351 --> 02:23:21,351
always got this way of looking at the
criticism and the praise and figuring out

2422
02:23:23,611 --> 02:23:27,660
which ones are right and
just fucking plowing ahead.

2423
02:23:28,230 --> 02:23:29,130
They just figured it out.

2424
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:31,950
He's figured out how to get better
and figured out how to be stronger.

2425
02:23:31,951 --> 02:23:33,180
I figured out how to write better.

2426
02:23:33,400 --> 02:23:37,200
I figured out how to kill on stage and
he just got this crazy point where he's

2427
02:23:37,201 --> 02:23:41,190
at now. Do you know about the men? Most
of producer Paradiso, I think it's called.

2428
02:23:41,220 --> 02:23:42,960
It's called the sensitive plant.

2429
02:23:43,200 --> 02:23:47,160
It's this really trippy plant that when
you touch it, it like moves and opens up.

2430
02:23:47,161 --> 02:23:50,220
Kind of like, like if you're scratching
the back of a cat or something like that,

2431
02:23:50,490 --> 02:23:53,880
it's really trippy. Uh, it's very
sensitive. Like, look, he just, you know,

2432
02:23:54,180 --> 02:23:59,070
touching it moves. Yeah. Whoa. And
then there's even parts where like,

2433
02:23:59,071 --> 02:24:01,820
it will curl up. Ooh, this is bizarre.

2434
02:24:02,700 --> 02:24:06,240
So he's touching it and these,
these leaves are actually retracting,

2435
02:24:06,241 --> 02:24:07,980
like they're sad. Closing up. Yeah.

2436
02:24:08,490 --> 02:24:12,450
And then you can also rub it and it will
kind of move towards the way of your

2437
02:24:12,451 --> 02:24:17,390
hand and like,
isn't that neat?

2438
02:24:19,160 --> 02:24:22,740
God Damn Dude, it's a, in Brazil,

2439
02:24:24,060 --> 02:24:25,920
Brazil's got all the crazy shit.

2440
02:24:26,250 --> 02:24:28,440
They've got that spider that
gives you a boner till you die.

2441
02:24:29,490 --> 02:24:31,980
Brazilian wandering spider.
Yeah. You know that one.

2442
02:24:31,981 --> 02:24:36,480
That's the one that gives you a boner and
it makes it, if you survive the poison,

2443
02:24:36,481 --> 02:24:40,170
which you probably won't, it'll
destroy your deck. So Dick's blown out.

2444
02:24:41,550 --> 02:24:44,520
That's ridiculous. Like a hotdog.
I wonder if they can dilute it.

2445
02:24:44,521 --> 02:24:47,440
Have we already talked about this? I
wonder if we could download it. Well,

2446
02:24:47,490 --> 02:24:50,460
they're trying to, they're certainly
working on it, but believe me,

2447
02:24:50,461 --> 02:24:53,040
they thought about it too.
Like I'm an idiot if I know that.

2448
02:24:53,041 --> 02:24:57,330
It makes you get harder on
women by scientists know to,
it's a thing now, a woman,

2449
02:24:57,331 --> 02:25:00,840
if I, Agora is a thing now. Well I
thought regular Viagara they use on women,

2450
02:25:01,050 --> 02:25:04,360
didn't they? Don't they use that on women?
I don't know. I don't want it enough.

2451
02:25:04,370 --> 02:25:08,680
This one vibrates flag
palsy.

2452
02:25:09,480 --> 02:25:14,430
It gives you some sort of
epilepsy. Yeah, I think that uh,

2453
02:25:14,431 --> 02:25:17,640
there's going be a lot of different
drugs they get from stuff like that.

2454
02:25:17,730 --> 02:25:20,670
I just can't wait to have something
where women take to get more horny.

2455
02:25:21,270 --> 02:25:24,400
I think that's going to change it. I think
it's a game changer. Drying solution.

2456
02:25:24,401 --> 02:25:26,500
He's like, I'm not getting
more attractive. So listen,

2457
02:25:26,900 --> 02:25:28,570
we're going to figure out
how to work at the other way.

2458
02:25:29,070 --> 02:25:32,140
Feel cause we could have just
waited. He fucked her. I was,

2459
02:25:32,170 --> 02:25:35,310
I didn't do it to themselves. Yeah.
It would have been free and clear. No,

2460
02:25:35,440 --> 02:25:40,180
no hard feelings at all. I mean, um,
did you see the snoop dog shit? Yeah,

2461
02:25:40,181 --> 02:25:42,580
it's fucked up. He's never going
to go to Sweden again. Does that,

2462
02:25:42,640 --> 02:25:44,710
does that worry you? Cause you
could have Sweden her life. No,

2463
02:25:44,711 --> 02:25:46,510
I've only been there once.
I think you went there,

2464
02:25:46,540 --> 02:25:50,530
but I enjoyed it and I
was sober. Um, Jesus.

2465
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:52,360
But he was driving though.

2466
02:25:52,390 --> 02:25:55,240
That's kind of weird that he was
actually driving in Sweden. Yeah.

2467
02:25:55,270 --> 02:25:58,090
I don't know the story. Is that
what happened? He's driving Jamie.

2468
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:04,240
He's accusing the Swedish
police of racially profiling
him after he was detained

2469
02:26:04,241 --> 02:26:07,390
in the town of Uppsala racially.

2470
02:26:08,230 --> 02:26:10,540
I think there are a little
bit different with a race.

2471
02:26:10,541 --> 02:26:13,710
I wonder how much so in Sweden
than they are in America.

2472
02:26:13,770 --> 02:26:17,500
Somebody I'd known it was
snoop to like Florida or Texas.

2473
02:26:17,501 --> 02:26:21,790
They pullover tour buses. Knowing
who wiz Khalifa, Willie Nelson,

2474
02:26:21,820 --> 02:26:25,580
people involved in arrests
in the same area. Right? Huh.

2475
02:26:27,140 --> 02:26:30,460
Huh?
I have no idea.

2476
02:26:30,490 --> 02:26:33,160
Maybe it's like his Negro,
a bad word still.

2477
02:26:34,450 --> 02:26:37,570
Is that where he's like still on the
fence? That's a good question. It may be,

2478
02:26:37,571 --> 02:26:41,500
I just fucked up by saying it.
So I don't think it's bad,

2479
02:26:41,501 --> 02:26:43,360
but it's just tasteful,
tasteful.

2480
02:26:43,870 --> 02:26:48,100
You know what's weird is that like the
difference between colored and people of

2481
02:26:48,101 --> 02:26:49,900
color,
it's like

2482
02:26:52,300 --> 02:26:55,390
it's such a small difference
between those two phrases.

2483
02:26:56,440 --> 02:26:59,970
Colored is offensive, right? You
say colored people it's offensive.

2484
02:26:59,980 --> 02:27:02,860
But if you say people
of color not offensive,

2485
02:27:03,190 --> 02:27:07,720
it's colored people really offensive that
if you call it two Mexicans, Asians, US,

2486
02:27:07,750 --> 02:27:12,160
anyone. Yeah, because they don't, they
don't like it. It doesn't, you know,

2487
02:27:12,400 --> 02:27:16,390
it's like the idea is there's regular
people and then there's colored people.

2488
02:27:16,420 --> 02:27:18,610
Right. So it may, it's like a distinction.

2489
02:27:18,790 --> 02:27:21,250
I like how Mexicans own the word
Brown now they're like, yeah,

2490
02:27:21,251 --> 02:27:25,490
I'm Brown and like we'll, they're
allowed to get away with Brown pride.

2491
02:27:25,780 --> 02:27:28,840
That's like a big source of contention
in the mixed martial arts community.

2492
02:27:29,170 --> 02:27:33,010
Cause Cain Velasquez who was the UFC
heavyweight champion until he just lost to

2493
02:27:33,011 --> 02:27:35,470
uh, uh, for ratio for doom.

2494
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:40,420
He has brown pride tattooed on his
chest and he's widely recognized.

2495
02:27:40,421 --> 02:27:42,280
It's not if not the all time great.

2496
02:27:42,281 --> 02:27:44,290
One of the all time great
heavyweight fighters ever.

2497
02:27:44,520 --> 02:27:47,260
And he has brown pride and
someone had said, you know,

2498
02:27:47,261 --> 02:27:51,100
a bunch of people said what would happen
if a guy was the heavyweight champion

2499
02:27:51,101 --> 02:27:55,900
like Brock Lesnar and he had white
pride on his chest. Like Whoa,

2500
02:27:56,140 --> 02:27:58,120
you're not allowed to have white pride.
Like that's,

2501
02:27:58,330 --> 02:28:03,310
you have to have only like it has to
be minorities. If it's, it's weird.

2502
02:28:03,320 --> 02:28:08,320
It's like I get it because it's like the
dominant white pride has been sort of

2503
02:28:08,771 --> 02:28:11,080
like automatically attached in our,

2504
02:28:11,081 --> 02:28:16,081
our idea with like the KKK or like some
crazy fucks that hate black people.

2505
02:28:16,270 --> 02:28:18,700
Whereas like with Brown part Brown pride,

2506
02:28:18,701 --> 02:28:22,010
we sort of have this idea like
automatically they just are happy

2507
02:28:22,010 --> 02:28:26,480
and proud. They're proud
people. They're proud to be
Mexican. It's okay. It's weird.

2508
02:28:26,481 --> 02:28:29,630
Right? It's very weird. It's weird,
but it's understandable. I mean,

2509
02:28:29,640 --> 02:28:32,150
totally makes sense to me. I'm not. I
just want to be really clear about that.

2510
02:28:32,151 --> 02:28:35,900
I'm not arguing against that
at all. I get it. I wouldn't,

2511
02:28:36,260 --> 02:28:41,260
I wouldn't hesitate for a second to think
that someone with a white pride tattoo

2512
02:28:42,321 --> 02:28:47,150
on the chest might be racist. I would. I
would. I would immediately go, oh Jesus.

2513
02:28:47,480 --> 02:28:50,300
If I was walking down the beach and some
dude was coming towards me and he had

2514
02:28:50,301 --> 02:28:54,080
white pride tattooed on his chest, I'd be
like, oh, confederate flag. Same thing.

2515
02:28:55,470 --> 02:28:59,360
Only difference between the confederate
flag is that the confederate flag for a

2516
02:28:59,361 --> 02:29:00,230
lot of people,

2517
02:29:00,231 --> 02:29:04,520
as ridiculous as it is represented
their love of the south.

2518
02:29:05,390 --> 02:29:10,390
I think that the idea of having this
rebel flag that also represented people

2519
02:29:12,711 --> 02:29:16,370
that wanted to keep slavery regardless
of all the economic arguments,

2520
02:29:16,371 --> 02:29:19,550
and I'm too fucking stupid to understand,
but you know,

2521
02:29:19,551 --> 02:29:22,440
and I know everybody knows you taught.
You start talking about the, the,

2522
02:29:22,990 --> 02:29:25,670
the generally and the dukes
of hazard and that fucking,

2523
02:29:27,050 --> 02:29:28,910
that rebel flag on the roof of it.

2524
02:29:28,940 --> 02:29:32,540
Everybody connects that with
the south in the civil war,

2525
02:29:32,570 --> 02:29:36,950
the war against the north that they lost.
And that's what created all of us.

2526
02:29:37,190 --> 02:29:39,170
We're all Americans now.
Okay.

2527
02:29:39,171 --> 02:29:42,050
This idea that you're still the south
and you have to have this fucking

2528
02:29:42,051 --> 02:29:46,010
different flag and I get that.
It would be fascinating,

2529
02:29:46,550 --> 02:29:50,420
but the idea that it's cool to just fly
that fucking thing in the State House.

2530
02:29:50,421 --> 02:29:55,070
It's crazy. It's crazy. It's bananas.

2531
02:29:55,071 --> 02:29:59,240
And even though I joked around
about it on Instagram, about a,

2532
02:29:59,241 --> 02:30:01,820
I did a whole post
about it, about the, uh,

2533
02:30:01,821 --> 02:30:05,810
the idea is ridiculous because the real
flag on that show was the daisy Duke

2534
02:30:05,870 --> 02:30:08,270
cause I was like,
daisy Duke represented a flat,

2535
02:30:08,271 --> 02:30:11,850
it was like the first time there was a,
an a,

2536
02:30:11,851 --> 02:30:15,290
a piece of clothing that let the world
know that you're hungry for Dick,

2537
02:30:15,350 --> 02:30:20,030
whether your slots are gay men,
if you wearing those cutoff shorts.

2538
02:30:20,480 --> 02:30:22,640
But that was my only reason for doing it.
I don't want,

2539
02:30:22,700 --> 02:30:26,510
I don't really have a political statement
and defensive keeping the flag in the

2540
02:30:26,511 --> 02:30:27,344
general Lee.

2541
02:30:27,380 --> 02:30:31,100
I think if you could have a fucking
dude with a laptop that can pretend that

2542
02:30:31,101 --> 02:30:33,320
he's jumping over cars in
the middle of the street,

2543
02:30:33,620 --> 02:30:36,740
turn that stupid flagging to into an
American flag. Let's joke around about it.

2544
02:30:37,010 --> 02:30:37,311
You know,

2545
02:30:37,311 --> 02:30:42,140
one point in time that flag used to be
the rebel flag of the rebel army that

2546
02:30:42,141 --> 02:30:45,170
fought in the civil war against the north
and loss. Can you believe that shit,

2547
02:30:45,200 --> 02:30:48,140
but now look at it. Oh, glory. Hold

2548
02:30:48,200 --> 02:30:49,033
Gloria.

2549
02:30:49,220 --> 02:30:53,540
I never ever thought anything about
racism growing up with that flag.

2550
02:30:53,570 --> 02:30:54,950
I thought it was a cool looking for lag.

2551
02:30:54,951 --> 02:30:58,010
I thought it was the flag from the Dukes
of Hazzard. I went to Williamsburg.

2552
02:30:58,040 --> 02:31:00,260
You would see that flag everywhere.
As a kid.

2553
02:31:00,261 --> 02:31:02,030
You were taught that flag like whatever.

2554
02:31:02,031 --> 02:31:05,540
It's the flag north south flag
you'd set by at the souvenir shop,

2555
02:31:05,650 --> 02:31:09,320
but I don't think it was ever taught to
us. It has any connections to racism.

2556
02:31:09,410 --> 02:31:12,170
I think that's just cause we were
too young and stupid. Stupid. Right?

2557
02:31:13,350 --> 02:31:16,080
But you're right, man. I used to
love the fucking dukes of Hazzard.

2558
02:31:16,081 --> 02:31:19,620
Everybody I know love the Dukes of
hazard. That show was the shit. Yeah,

2559
02:31:19,800 --> 02:31:22,800
just the Google home born and you
know that we'll be back there.

2560
02:31:22,801 --> 02:31:26,850
It's just going to take them to a couple
of months to track the American flag on

2561
02:31:26,851 --> 02:31:31,660
it. You know, repaint it. CGI style. I
hope they do. I mean, I don't know man.

2562
02:31:33,330 --> 02:31:35,520
Obviously I have a point
of view of a white guy,

2563
02:31:37,110 --> 02:31:39,480
point of view of a white guy when
it comes to shit like slavery.

2564
02:31:39,481 --> 02:31:43,200
So I always like, it's a, you
know, say hi. Say what you feel,

2565
02:31:43,201 --> 02:31:47,990
but recognize it's not about your people
and it wasn't really that fucking long

2566
02:31:47,991 --> 02:31:52,920
ago. 1865 what does that, yeah,
that ain't shit. You know,

2567
02:31:53,250 --> 02:31:56,500
when you know, you know you're having
a birthday show August 5th right?

2568
02:31:56,580 --> 02:31:59,070
How old are you going to be?
41 think about that shit.

2569
02:31:59,310 --> 02:32:02,760
I think about 1865 it ain't shit.
It ain't shit. It ain't shit.

2570
02:32:02,761 --> 02:32:05,390
That shit was yesterday.
They had slaves, dude,

2571
02:32:05,400 --> 02:32:07,830
I'm 47 I'm going to be 48 in August.

2572
02:32:08,250 --> 02:32:11,030
The slaves were like a day before
I was born. They had slaves.

2573
02:32:11,670 --> 02:32:13,290
That's fucking stupid,
man.

2574
02:32:13,620 --> 02:32:17,730
It was to literally 200 years
before I was born. That is nothing.

2575
02:32:18,330 --> 02:32:20,130
That's nothing.
That's not that much time.

2576
02:32:20,500 --> 02:32:23,300
I remember a hundred years
before I was born is crazy.

2577
02:32:23,310 --> 02:32:28,140
Had fucking slavery two years before that.
That's real,

2578
02:32:28,380 --> 02:32:33,150
right? 1865 I was born in 1967 so
literally a hundred years. 200 years.

2579
02:32:33,151 --> 02:32:36,900
A hundred years ago. 200 years ago.
There was slavery everywhere, right?

2580
02:32:36,901 --> 02:32:41,220
It was commonplace 300 years ago.
400 years ago. What is 400 years?

2581
02:32:41,400 --> 02:32:45,960
If you live to be 100 that's
that's, you know, that's awesome.

2582
02:32:45,990 --> 02:32:47,190
That's like the best you get,

2583
02:32:47,370 --> 02:32:51,720
so your life and his life back
to back is slavery everywhere.

2584
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:56,190
If you live the full potential of Jamie
and the full potential of red band back

2585
02:32:56,191 --> 02:33:00,820
to back, birth to death, and
that's slavery everywhere.

2586
02:33:02,110 --> 02:33:06,160
Not even an argument against it. It's
just fucking a part of doing business.

2587
02:33:07,180 --> 02:33:08,890
That's not that long ago at all.

2588
02:33:09,910 --> 02:33:13,630
Think about the idea of 1865

2589
02:33:14,040 --> 02:33:14,873
okay.

2590
02:33:15,050 --> 02:33:19,790
That's bananas. The Beatles were
less than a hundred years later.

2591
02:33:20,750 --> 02:33:25,570
Less than a hundred years after
the Beatles, or excuse me,

2592
02:33:25,571 --> 02:33:29,410
before the Beatles, there was slavery
less than a hundred years after slavery.

2593
02:33:29,411 --> 02:33:34,390
You have the Beatles. How? How not
is that 1865 think about that, right?

2594
02:33:35,080 --> 02:33:39,130
Was it 70 65 what year was it?
What? What years of civil war?

2595
02:33:39,131 --> 02:33:43,990
What do you do that as you forget
we hear was forward.

2596
02:33:44,170 --> 02:33:47,510
What year was that guy? 1921 no, for that.

2597
02:33:47,710 --> 02:33:51,160
Is it like sixties sixties or
seventies when you were at Gerald Ford.

2598
02:33:52,060 --> 02:33:55,720
Gerald Ford? No, not the cars. The
Ford. Gerald. Well, it's a Nixon.

2599
02:33:56,020 --> 02:33:58,720
Nixon was a seventies right?
Yeah. Thinking about that guy,

2600
02:33:58,900 --> 02:34:03,610
sixties in the 70s what was the year a
Kennedy died in [inaudible] 63 correct?

2601
02:34:03,611 --> 02:34:08,200
Is that right? Somewhere around
then Johnson. Okay. Kennedy,

2602
02:34:08,230 --> 02:34:12,790
then Johnson and then Nixon after
him. Yeah. Is that what happened?

2603
02:34:13,050 --> 02:34:16,960
And then Carter? Yeah, dairy
again. That's not that long.

2604
02:34:18,290 --> 02:34:20,770
Q magic.
Richard Nixon ran for president today.

2605
02:34:25,360 --> 02:34:28,690
TV show 30 something.
I used to think that those people are old.

2606
02:34:28,770 --> 02:34:32,350
Oh my God are dead. They were dead.
I was in high school. I was like,

2607
02:34:32,351 --> 02:34:35,020
this poor folks are dead.
That was,

2608
02:34:35,030 --> 02:34:38,500
now I'm 40 41 and a couple of weeks.

2609
02:34:38,650 --> 02:34:43,550
30 something that's so
depressing. Um, Sandra Bullock,

2610
02:34:44,500 --> 02:34:48,920
it's signaling insane. 45 older. 51 what?

2611
02:34:50,580 --> 02:34:55,330
That crazy. Wow. What happened
there? Life. It waits for no man.

2612
02:34:55,331 --> 02:35:00,010
Brian Red Ban waits for no man.
How bizarre is that?

2613
02:35:02,180 --> 02:35:07,090
It's weird.
A year is in our eyes.

2614
02:35:07,150 --> 02:35:11,870
A long time. They used to be,
I don't think of it anymore.
Listen on that long man.

2615
02:35:11,960 --> 02:35:14,030
I mean, I checked my mail
four times a year, so it's,

2616
02:35:15,860 --> 02:35:20,620
it's just for male sessions for me,
the idea of 10 years,

2617
02:35:20,680 --> 02:35:24,820
it used to be so big. It's an
it happens quick. I would do,

2618
02:35:24,880 --> 02:35:27,920
I would definitely, she's beautiful.
Beautiful. Don't say that.

2619
02:35:27,930 --> 02:35:31,180
What you would do to her sexually because
that's gross. She say she's beautiful.

2620
02:35:31,660 --> 02:35:36,070
She's hiding her man, so she's hiding.
Your hands are hands. That might change.

2621
02:35:37,150 --> 02:35:40,840
It might be she might've been in the
middle of some sort of a dance when she

2622
02:35:40,841 --> 02:35:45,060
spreads her hands out. Why? But they start
from behind her. Women get weird hands.

2623
02:35:47,140 --> 02:35:49,150
It goes to the first to go is their hands.

2624
02:35:49,540 --> 02:35:53,500
You didn't need to get checks to work
gloves now fetishists weird checks like

2625
02:35:53,501 --> 02:35:54,460
harnesses and shit.

2626
02:35:57,850 --> 02:36:01,810
She's still beautiful. But it is weird
that you realize as you get older,

2627
02:36:01,811 --> 02:36:06,640
how quick a year is then how
quick 10 years is and 10 20,

2628
02:36:06,700 --> 02:36:11,230
30 40 ch ch,
ch the differences,

2629
02:36:11,231 --> 02:36:14,380
we're able to access more information
than any generation before us.

2630
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:16,870
So I think because of that overload,

2631
02:36:16,871 --> 02:36:20,530
we're looking at all this different
shit like people that we knew and loved

2632
02:36:20,531 --> 02:36:23,380
growing up that are dying and we go,
oh,

2633
02:36:23,381 --> 02:36:28,270
this is a weird little fucking crazy
ride that everybody's on here that nobody

2634
02:36:28,271 --> 02:36:30,760
really seems to be paying attention
to exactly how this thing works.

2635
02:36:31,210 --> 02:36:33,580
And no one's even really totally,

2636
02:36:33,581 --> 02:36:36,190
completely aware of it
until like fairly recently,

2637
02:36:36,580 --> 02:36:39,910
like within the last few hundred years
of life. Have you, did you see it?

2638
02:36:39,940 --> 02:36:42,760
I saw this thing, uh, yesterday
when I was looking online.

2639
02:36:42,790 --> 02:36:47,560
It's a visualization of why time seems
to be faster as you get older and it's

2640
02:36:47,830 --> 02:36:52,740
based just on math, like as when you're
to your reference of a year. Right.

2641
02:36:52,810 --> 02:36:55,510
As long as you get older, I'll show
it to you. No, it totally makes sense.

2642
02:36:55,600 --> 02:37:00,240
I've seen that before, but yeah,
put that up right here. Oh,

2643
02:37:00,250 --> 02:37:03,130
and whole life in a timeline.
Oh, okay. That makes sense.

2644
02:37:03,190 --> 02:37:08,190
Like when you're all the way at
17 there was a small Saul fractal.

2645
02:37:09,700 --> 02:37:14,080
Yeah. Scariest shit. Yeah. I mean,

2646
02:37:14,110 --> 02:37:17,870
I guess it is, but if you said
earlier, like you said earlier,

2647
02:37:17,900 --> 02:37:21,320
you know that you think that when you
die it's going to be like, Oh yeah,

2648
02:37:21,410 --> 02:37:25,970
I'm okay. Oh, here I am again. If that's
the case, what are we worried about?

2649
02:37:27,620 --> 02:37:32,300
But we are, we don't know.
We definitely don't know.

2650
02:37:32,450 --> 02:37:35,390
But the interesting thing is it's, for
some people it's just like not knowing,

2651
02:37:35,391 --> 02:37:39,680
so is too much. It's
too fucked up. You know?

2652
02:37:40,220 --> 02:37:43,580
That's where I think things like that
Mirage men show that we were talking about

2653
02:37:43,581 --> 02:37:43,881
earlier.

2654
02:37:43,881 --> 02:37:48,200
I think what that is is the same thing
that's like some ridiculous hardcore cult

2655
02:37:48,500 --> 02:37:51,830
kind of religion. The need to believe
in something that's bigger and better.

2656
02:37:52,220 --> 02:37:55,970
The need to believe in something that's
above all of this that you see in front

2657
02:37:55,971 --> 02:38:00,800
of you. Something bigger and crazier.
It's Sorta like legitimizes existence,

2658
02:38:02,210 --> 02:38:04,640
you know? But if there
really are aliens, right?

2659
02:38:04,641 --> 02:38:07,220
If there really were aliens are coming
here from another planet and they weren't

2660
02:38:07,221 --> 02:38:08,150
even talking to us,

2661
02:38:08,660 --> 02:38:11,330
like how needy our way we keep reaching
out to these fuckers that don't even

2662
02:38:11,331 --> 02:38:11,760
want to talk.

2663
02:38:11,760 --> 02:38:14,460
Tours were probably super annoying.

2664
02:38:15,110 --> 02:38:18,760
It won't stop calling
me. They're like, listen,

2665
02:38:18,761 --> 02:38:23,740
I picked up one of them in 1950 to
this day. It's a fucking industry.

2666
02:38:23,950 --> 02:38:27,550
Okay? Everywhere you look,
there's websites dedicated.

2667
02:38:27,551 --> 02:38:31,600
They make documentaries and
books and it's all lies.

2668
02:38:31,601 --> 02:38:36,280
Except one guy told one fucking guy,
keep his mouth shut. He couldn't do it.

2669
02:38:36,340 --> 02:38:41,020
I touched his butt. So whatever. Now
it's a part of the fucking folklore.

2670
02:38:41,050 --> 02:38:44,140
They always touch your butt and they're
always doing things to your asshole,

2671
02:38:44,290 --> 02:38:47,020
right? That's the whole thing.
They say they do anal probes.

2672
02:38:47,021 --> 02:38:48,730
That's the whole thing.
I was drunk.

2673
02:38:48,790 --> 02:38:52,070
One Dude who flew here from
another planet and found out where,

2674
02:38:52,071 --> 02:38:57,071
oh fucking country filled with rats were
a guy or a civilization that kinky bomb

2675
02:38:58,281 --> 02:39:00,940
mouse.
Shucked it was an experience.

2676
02:39:00,941 --> 02:39:05,800
We shared together a magic wand,
a cold steal table,

2677
02:39:06,160 --> 02:39:10,150
a bright light, a wad in your ass hole.
All right, this is what we're doing.

2678
02:39:10,151 --> 02:39:12,100
We're checking you out.
I want to see what you're made out of.

2679
02:39:12,340 --> 02:39:16,000
What do you like and what
happened became a whole thing.

2680
02:39:16,260 --> 02:39:19,690
Do you think it's weird when birds do
this kind of shit where they all sit like

2681
02:39:19,691 --> 02:39:24,070
flock together in these huge crazy
like it's like crop circle in the sky.

2682
02:39:24,280 --> 02:39:29,230
This seems like to me something that's
like, I don't know, like a, a mistake,

2683
02:39:29,260 --> 02:39:33,280
like a glitch in our universe
where birds can do these weird,

2684
02:39:34,060 --> 02:39:36,670
it's like they're all
falling the same program.

2685
02:39:36,700 --> 02:39:39,670
Like I think their power went out and
they're resetting or something like that.

2686
02:39:40,120 --> 02:39:44,590
Well the crazy thing is that exists
and all in nature. Yeah, fish do it.

2687
02:39:44,670 --> 02:39:46,660
Beautiful Way.
Fish do it just like this.

2688
02:39:46,661 --> 02:39:48,820
And the difference between
the birds and the fish.

2689
02:39:48,821 --> 02:39:52,870
Obviously he's the birds can land,
the fish have to kind of keep moving.

2690
02:39:53,230 --> 02:39:57,100
But some of the fish videos of
these giant schools of fish,

2691
02:39:57,220 --> 02:40:00,820
they look exactly like this. Right? Yeah.
Don't though, for the audio listeners,

2692
02:40:00,821 --> 02:40:04,120
we're what we're actually watching where
you see a humongous amount of birds.

2693
02:40:04,121 --> 02:40:06,340
This case, it's, I think
starlets I think they're called.

2694
02:40:06,430 --> 02:40:07,930
What's the name of this video?
Jamie?

2695
02:40:08,390 --> 02:40:12,600
Brian's planet is called watch starlings,

2696
02:40:12,660 --> 02:40:14,350
a spectacular murmur.

2697
02:40:14,480 --> 02:40:18,760
They're called Mermaid Moravians
when murmuring creations.

2698
02:40:18,810 --> 02:40:20,640
Murmuration if you Google that,

2699
02:40:20,641 --> 02:40:22,890
you can see a lot of cool
photos and stuff like that.

2700
02:40:22,920 --> 02:40:27,090
Murmuration numerations yeah.
And uh,

2701
02:40:27,390 --> 02:40:31,860
it's just weird that it seems like
the birds are all doing it. Like,

2702
02:40:31,890 --> 02:40:34,130
like almost like a program like that.
It doesn't seem like, it's like,

2703
02:40:34,180 --> 02:40:37,550
like they're just kind of following a
pattern that they're supposed to follow.

2704
02:40:38,830 --> 02:40:40,630
The ants do that too.

2705
02:40:40,690 --> 02:40:45,460
And a with ants when one of their members
dies, I think it's the queen. Yeah.

2706
02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:46,450
Pretty sure it's the queen.

2707
02:40:46,451 --> 02:40:49,720
They have an ant death spiral where they
don't know where to go. Yes, it is. Ants.

2708
02:40:49,740 --> 02:40:52,090
Yeah. Pull up ant death spiral, Jamie.

2709
02:40:52,120 --> 02:40:55,210
That is the most bizarre shit ever
because there's somehow or another file

2710
02:40:55,240 --> 02:40:56,470
following each other.

2711
02:40:57,250 --> 02:41:01,990
There's a scent or something that
they're looking for and they can't find,

2712
02:41:01,991 --> 02:41:03,340
and when they can't find it,

2713
02:41:03,640 --> 02:41:07,210
they all just keep walking in a circle
until they fucking shit the bed.

2714
02:41:09,040 --> 02:41:13,930
Oh, there's just explained. Is it an
explanation? There is another video where,

2715
02:41:13,960 --> 02:41:16,230
can we play the explanation
or would it be like copper up?

2716
02:41:17,470 --> 02:41:19,120
Give him a credit for whatever it is.

2717
02:41:21,590 --> 02:41:24,650
What is the discovery
channel or discovery channel?

2718
02:41:25,130 --> 02:41:28,190
It says aunt death circles explained this.

2719
02:41:28,220 --> 02:41:31,460
James Williams discovery news in a spiral.

2720
02:41:31,461 --> 02:41:35,060
It's bizarre and we wanted to
find out exactly what's going on.

2721
02:41:35,080 --> 02:41:39,840
We should talk Usta Research,
Hurricane Sandy,

2722
02:41:40,030 --> 02:41:41,830
that different than a hurricane going on

2723
02:41:41,910 --> 02:41:43,260
in this video is we have an

2724
02:41:43,520 --> 02:41:45,110
look at that. That's a
hurricane. Yeah. Yeah.

2725
02:41:45,230 --> 02:41:49,490
Have you [inaudible] it's Tony went
to check it. Hurricane that's crazy.

2726
02:41:49,730 --> 02:41:54,440
Amp is following the trail
pheromone that trail chemicals.

2727
02:41:54,550 --> 02:41:57,190
Wow. So it's a smart
and they've got, yeah,

2728
02:41:57,320 --> 02:42:01,110
during rounds so that they're following
endlessly their neighbors. Now,

2729
02:42:01,150 --> 02:42:04,700
the problem we have is
that army answer blind and

2730
02:42:05,740 --> 02:42:06,573
these are,

2731
02:42:06,680 --> 02:42:10,130
and they are very dependent
on following trails,

2732
02:42:11,430 --> 02:42:14,370
also ready to spin around
so they starve to death.

2733
02:42:14,520 --> 02:42:16,970
Why do we believe these people though?
He does.

2734
02:42:16,971 --> 02:42:20,790
What a fucking hands thinking this thing,
you can't even see it so small.

2735
02:42:20,791 --> 02:42:24,960
But this guy's like, no, I got it. He
knows the smell. It's the smell. Well,

2736
02:42:24,961 --> 02:42:29,410
they've done a lot of studies on ants.
Don't make any mistake about it.

2737
02:42:29,460 --> 02:42:32,610
I'm sitting there with doing
a questionnaire. Yes, no,

2738
02:42:34,720 --> 02:42:37,500
you know what I just said that they did
a lot of studies on the answer and I'm

2739
02:42:37,501 --> 02:42:41,100
assuming they've done a lot of studies
on it or just believing these guys that

2740
02:42:41,101 --> 02:42:45,850
smoke a lot of weed that Ha, let's
make it a smell thing. No, I have a,

2741
02:42:45,870 --> 02:42:47,970
you know,
it's like all these studies,

2742
02:42:48,090 --> 02:42:51,030
you look at some of these studies and
you're like, oh, that must be the truth.

2743
02:42:51,031 --> 02:42:53,100
And you find out,
oh they forgot to do this.

2744
02:42:53,101 --> 02:42:57,470
So now that makes that study 100%
fake in a, you know, like, uh,

2745
02:42:57,510 --> 02:43:01,340
there's a lot of studies where they
just didn't test the right thing and uh,

2746
02:43:01,440 --> 02:43:03,630
you know, later in life
they find like, oh,

2747
02:43:03,660 --> 02:43:07,650
we should have tested for this other
chemical and that makes that whole study

2748
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:11,980
vat a void, you know? Uh, definitely
does happen all the time. I

2749
02:43:11,980 --> 02:43:12,970
don't know of any examples.

2750
02:43:12,970 --> 02:43:15,620
Well, I could do, I don't
want to even bring it up. I,

2751
02:43:16,820 --> 02:43:18,940
I don't want to break it
up by that teaches college.

2752
02:43:21,100 --> 02:43:24,940
Yeah. The way of explaining things just
yeah. No, you've got a good point though.

2753
02:43:25,390 --> 02:43:28,270
Never know they, they learn
new shit all the time. Right.

2754
02:43:28,300 --> 02:43:31,630
There's always some new
stuff that invalidates all
the stuff they used to think

2755
02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:35,910
for. There's a lot of wacky shit they
used to believe in not that long ago.

2756
02:43:36,070 --> 02:43:39,130
We find out about medicine and all
the weird shit that people used to do.

2757
02:43:39,131 --> 02:43:39,750
Just not that.

2758
02:43:39,750 --> 02:43:41,190
I think vitamin C,
like I think,

2759
02:43:41,191 --> 02:43:44,250
didn't they say something recently
where they thought vitamin C was the,

2760
02:43:44,251 --> 02:43:48,230
the the number one go to like if you
to build up your immune system and,

2761
02:43:48,231 --> 02:43:51,520
and stuff like that for you.
Yeah, but I thought there
was also studies. I go, nope,

2762
02:43:51,540 --> 02:43:55,530
we, we thought that's not completely
right. Or like drinking wine every day.

2763
02:43:55,531 --> 02:43:56,120
I think there's,

2764
02:43:56,120 --> 02:43:58,980
there's like so many like these studies
that are like that where like, no,

2765
02:43:58,990 --> 02:44:02,040
a glass of wine, it's really good for
your heart. And then they find out like,

2766
02:44:02,130 --> 02:44:05,040
like two years, Larry. Oh No,
we ever wrong. My are bad. We,

2767
02:44:05,100 --> 02:44:06,570
it's actually really thought it was,

2768
02:44:06,571 --> 02:44:09,930
the resveratrol from the glass of
wine was actually proven to work.

2769
02:44:10,020 --> 02:44:11,560
I'm just using that as an eight January.
Yeah.

2770
02:44:11,670 --> 02:44:14,800
Maple and making one up.
Yeah. Yeah. Well they,

2771
02:44:14,820 --> 02:44:18,330
they definitely learned shit all the
time. It wouldn't obviously, I mean,

2772
02:44:18,390 --> 02:44:21,150
when you look at all the medical
breakthroughs they're making at a Dale,

2773
02:44:21,151 --> 02:44:22,440
you've seen the new penis thing.

2774
02:44:22,650 --> 02:44:25,140
They're going to be a little to build
you a new penis within five years.

2775
02:44:25,170 --> 02:44:29,220
I'm good. But could you imagine that?
Get my penis taken out? Well, okay.

2776
02:44:29,221 --> 02:44:31,260
Five years they start
with regular size decks.

2777
02:44:31,500 --> 02:44:35,130
How long before they start getting crazy,
if they can actually make you a dick,

2778
02:44:35,340 --> 02:44:35,600
like,

2779
02:44:35,600 --> 02:44:39,810
and the idea is that you have injured
your Dick and some sort of a mechanical

2780
02:44:39,811 --> 02:44:43,590
accident mouth.
So sort of a industry job here,

2781
02:44:44,040 --> 02:44:46,320
working on machines and whatever.

2782
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:51,900
But if you hang in there for five years,
they can actually make you a new deck,

2783
02:44:51,940 --> 02:44:54,360
right. Printed deck. I'm sure. I
don't know what they're going to do,

2784
02:44:54,361 --> 02:44:55,141
how they're going to do it,

2785
02:44:55,141 --> 02:44:57,270
but they think within five years
you'll be able to make you a deck.

2786
02:44:57,450 --> 02:44:59,460
So there will be no more micro penises.

2787
02:44:59,700 --> 02:45:03,990
So all those poor fuckers
that got just the, you know,

2788
02:45:03,991 --> 02:45:08,160
it's a really got to be a giant bummer
man to be born with this like tiny, tiny,

2789
02:45:08,161 --> 02:45:12,570
tiny, tiny, tiny deck. And a lot
of people are not any mom bench.

2790
02:45:13,200 --> 02:45:17,220
Not Anymore.
Now they got a dick like Thor.

2791
02:45:17,970 --> 02:45:22,380
How big do you think Thoratec has
to do plays? Thor thick, thick,

2792
02:45:23,280 --> 02:45:25,890
thick, like a fucking 10
year old weightlifters leg.

2793
02:45:26,190 --> 02:45:30,330
Oh yeah, I'm surprised. People with small
dicks aren't more child molesters. Right?

2794
02:45:33,780 --> 02:45:34,950
Write that down.

2795
02:45:36,320 --> 02:45:39,440
Like child molesters should
10 year old weight lifters,

2796
02:45:39,441 --> 02:45:44,080
leg child molesters you think
would be all about like, uh,

2797
02:45:44,110 --> 02:45:46,560
the small Dick people would
all be about child molesters,

2798
02:45:48,200 --> 02:45:50,570
I guess.
I don't know.

2799
02:45:50,690 --> 02:45:54,910
Right? Like if you had a really
small Dick and, and that you're,

2800
02:45:54,911 --> 02:45:58,220
your only thing would be Asian
girls and children or something.

2801
02:45:58,221 --> 02:46:01,720
I don't know what the fuck I'm
talking about. Yeah, please.

2802
02:46:01,730 --> 02:46:04,010
I'm trying to get you to hold the
ball while I write this thing down.

2803
02:46:04,370 --> 02:46:08,930
Don't throw it in the
fucking ocean. Uh, the, uh,

2804
02:46:09,740 --> 02:46:14,740
AP added 550,000 old knee
newsreel clips to youtube.

2805
02:46:15,021 --> 02:46:18,770
So all these, uh, old school news
clips, I've just been added to youtube,

2806
02:46:18,771 --> 02:46:21,680
like old school stuff.
Uh, which is Kinda cool.

2807
02:46:22,280 --> 02:46:26,000
They have a video right now showing all
the different stuff and we're talking

2808
02:46:26,001 --> 02:46:27,480
like, like, uh,

2809
02:46:27,500 --> 02:46:31,700
that you're allowed to use
and post up on, uh, things.

2810
02:46:31,701 --> 02:46:36,080
Can you guys open? Yeah, it's open
now. They have video archive at Apa.

2811
02:46:36,410 --> 02:46:38,300
So you have all these old school,
raw,

2812
02:46:38,301 --> 02:46:42,560
uncut videos that are now just all thrown
on youtube now. So that's kind of cool.

2813
02:46:42,590 --> 02:46:46,590
You get to see some, some old
shit. That's incredible. Yeah.

2814
02:46:47,150 --> 02:46:49,220
Elvis stuff.
Uh,

2815
02:46:51,280 --> 02:46:54,170
well you can embed into your website.
That's insane.

2816
02:46:55,600 --> 02:46:56,433
Wow.

2817
02:46:57,790 --> 02:47:01,360
What's insane really is when you think
about how much access to visual history

2818
02:47:01,361 --> 02:47:04,330
we have compared to any,

2819
02:47:04,840 --> 02:47:07,690
any race ever or any civilization ever.

2820
02:47:07,720 --> 02:47:11,500
The difference being the difference
between writing stuff down on parchment.

2821
02:47:11,930 --> 02:47:16,570
Would that, do you ever see that Marco
Polo show from a Netflix now Marco Polo.

2822
02:47:16,840 --> 02:47:19,640
It's good. Fuck on show dude. It's
one of those Netflix originals.

2823
02:47:19,660 --> 02:47:20,830
Does that take place in a pool?

2824
02:47:20,920 --> 02:47:21,753
Huh?

2825
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:30,500
No, no. It takes place. Uh, and the,
the uh, the Gingiss con days king,

2826
02:47:30,501 --> 02:47:34,610
his cons. I think his grandson cooler con,
I think it was his son or his grandson,

2827
02:47:34,910 --> 02:47:39,260
but it's all about the Mongols
and Marco Polo too. It's crazy.

2828
02:47:39,500 --> 02:47:43,730
It's wild. It's amazing. It's
really fucking good show. It's fun.

2829
02:47:43,731 --> 02:47:48,140
It's fun to watch what we talking
about that maybe bring that up. Photos,

2830
02:47:48,470 --> 02:47:50,780
video, visual history, like
think about like their,

2831
02:47:50,781 --> 02:47:52,730
when they would read their history
and they read their history,

2832
02:47:52,731 --> 02:47:56,090
they have these fucking scrolls,
they pull out. It says the pawn,

2833
02:47:56,091 --> 02:47:59,450
the seventh day of the ninth month,
you know,

2834
02:47:59,750 --> 02:48:02,030
Cesar walk towards the water,

2835
02:48:02,060 --> 02:48:07,060
drank upon it and found the fish that
contain the disease that killed the city.

2836
02:48:07,550 --> 02:48:08,240
I mean the,

2837
02:48:08,240 --> 02:48:11,570
you had a fucking sit around the campfire
and guess what the fuck happened?

2838
02:48:11,900 --> 02:48:14,930
You had to guess what the fuck happened
just two, three generations ago.

2839
02:48:15,200 --> 02:48:17,890
We could look back at
video from World War One.

2840
02:48:18,230 --> 02:48:21,470
We can watch film footage
from World War fucking one.

2841
02:48:21,800 --> 02:48:26,420
We can watch world war two Vietnam. We
can watch guys smoke pot out of shotguns.

2842
02:48:26,840 --> 02:48:28,430
We can watch shit from Iraq.

2843
02:48:28,431 --> 02:48:33,431
We could see night vision footage
from Iraq and Afghanistan to,

2844
02:48:33,710 --> 02:48:38,710
we've seen more shit visually than any
race that's ever existed ever than any,

2845
02:48:39,441 --> 02:48:43,490
any civilization ever.
And not by a small amount.

2846
02:48:43,491 --> 02:48:44,620
By an enormous amount.
Yes.

2847
02:48:44,650 --> 02:48:45,430
This is a little kid.

2848
02:48:45,430 --> 02:48:50,080
This is a nine year old smoking tobacco
and going off on cursing and stuff like

2849
02:48:50,081 --> 02:48:52,660
that and not Iraq. Really. Yeah.

2850
02:49:01,530 --> 02:49:05,230
Can we know what she's saying?
This is on live like right now.

2851
02:49:05,231 --> 02:49:07,770
And I think they had some translate it

2852
02:49:07,980 --> 02:49:08,813
in the comments.

2853
02:49:10,920 --> 02:49:15,420
She might be just talking about how Mickey
Mouse and his weight cuter than Daffy

2854
02:49:15,420 --> 02:49:17,940
Duck.
We don't even know what it says.

2855
02:49:17,970 --> 02:49:21,540
Nine year old Arab smokes
and curses nonstop. So uh,

2856
02:49:21,670 --> 02:49:24,340
in the people in the comments
that some people have actually uh,

2857
02:49:24,380 --> 02:49:28,350
translate it so I don't want to read
it. Get us killed. Right. Be careful.

2858
02:49:29,550 --> 02:49:33,600
She seemed like she was a fervent
believer of something. These photos,

2859
02:49:33,601 --> 02:49:36,420
those are these birds making different
shapes and stuff like that there.

2860
02:49:36,540 --> 02:49:40,530
It's beautiful. It's almost like
an art piece and it's insane.

2861
02:49:40,590 --> 02:49:44,370
It makes me wonder what if there's
something more to that. Well, it,

2862
02:49:44,371 --> 02:49:48,120
it also looks like certain wavelengths
I feel like capture like radio

2863
02:49:48,121 --> 02:49:52,590
wavelengths you ever see like, like
images or interpretations of wavelength?

2864
02:49:52,620 --> 02:49:54,780
Yes.
Wavelengths and fish.

2865
02:49:54,870 --> 02:49:59,550
Schools of fish and schools of birds.
It's kind of like crop circles at school.

2866
02:49:59,550 --> 02:50:03,000
Birds, no. Oh Fuck, fuck Jesus Christ.

2867
02:50:03,060 --> 02:50:05,350
It's kind tired of natural crop
circles and not the fake one.

2868
02:50:05,820 --> 02:50:09,420
You know what I mean? Like it's
like, here's the thing, why?

2869
02:50:09,421 --> 02:50:12,390
Who the fuck is making crop circles
and look, stop being a dick.

2870
02:50:12,420 --> 02:50:16,520
Just come out and let all these dummies
know that you made all these designs and

2871
02:50:16,521 --> 02:50:19,410
do it again. I think they have, I
think we just haven't caught up.

2872
02:50:19,760 --> 02:50:23,970
So they have some, right? They have
some, they definitely have some,

2873
02:50:23,971 --> 02:50:26,730
but there's some of them that they don't
want to give up how they made them.

2874
02:50:27,180 --> 02:50:28,530
That's my interpretation.

2875
02:50:28,650 --> 02:50:31,440
I mean there's some fucking people that
have dedicated their life towards the

2876
02:50:31,441 --> 02:50:34,470
mystery of the crop circle.
Have you ever seen it?

2877
02:50:34,471 --> 02:50:36,570
Secrets in the field
is a documentary on it.

2878
02:50:36,860 --> 02:50:39,390
Mysteries in the field that he did it.

2879
02:50:39,690 --> 02:50:44,040
What if we find out big foot did
it all even even if they do do it.

2880
02:50:44,090 --> 02:50:47,400
You imagine if like that's the
coolest shit you could show us. Oh,

2881
02:50:47,401 --> 02:50:50,580
we knew it was still on grows.
If you come from another planet,

2882
02:50:50,581 --> 02:50:52,560
you fucking step on our food.
You Dick.

2883
02:50:53,370 --> 02:50:57,830
You know they don't do tree circles.
You know we can't eat trees. All right,

2884
02:50:57,840 --> 02:51:01,680
fuck you. See if sue, we have
enough houses do a tree circle,

2885
02:51:02,950 --> 02:51:07,490
but don't be fucking step in our
food, right? It'll crush our wheat.

2886
02:51:07,491 --> 02:51:12,150
You douchebag those. Turn our corn
and some fucking picture of you.

2887
02:51:13,010 --> 02:51:16,720
Who Dick. Right, right. Build a,

2888
02:51:16,740 --> 02:51:19,770
build a house for a homeless person
tonight that instead come on asshole.

2889
02:51:20,430 --> 02:51:22,470
Help the community out. Yeah. Why do you,

2890
02:51:22,620 --> 02:51:25,620
why do you have to show me some
cryptic fucking stupid message?

2891
02:51:26,170 --> 02:51:30,960
Too dumb to send me a text.
Hey Dude. Hey red band.

2892
02:51:30,961 --> 02:51:32,790
It's popped the alien.
Hey listen man.

2893
02:51:33,150 --> 02:51:36,810
Have you ever thought about moving
to Alaska? You might take it easy.

2894
02:51:37,820 --> 02:51:42,450
It's a little messages like that.
Don't fucking talk about impending doom.

2895
02:51:42,451 --> 02:51:43,770
Write it down inside wheat.

2896
02:51:44,740 --> 02:51:48,570
What will send me a text message to find
out that that we had been talking to

2897
02:51:48,571 --> 02:51:52,290
aliens for the whole time and they're
just like the evil people on Youtube.

2898
02:51:52,380 --> 02:51:55,360
Like the bad commenters and the negative
people. They're actually the alien.

2899
02:51:55,361 --> 02:51:59,490
It's like fuck you. Like they're
just trolling. This could be,

2900
02:51:59,880 --> 02:52:03,070
and that's why we think like how dumb is
this person? Why is this person so mean?

2901
02:52:03,090 --> 02:52:05,770
Why is that person so, yeah,
it's a fucking alien somewhere.

2902
02:52:06,190 --> 02:52:08,410
How about this in might not
even be the trolling us.

2903
02:52:08,411 --> 02:52:12,360
It might be that they were created
by the aliens, [inaudible] fathers,

2904
02:52:12,440 --> 02:52:17,140
their components in a
mathematical equation to sort
of push life along and the

2905
02:52:17,141 --> 02:52:20,860
components are really fucking annoying
stupid people and they would just keep

2906
02:52:20,861 --> 02:52:23,590
you moving forward to try to get
out of the way these retards.

2907
02:52:23,890 --> 02:52:25,180
And that's why you push further.

2908
02:52:25,181 --> 02:52:28,480
And that's why we have like those
Honda Atvs and shit like that.

2909
02:52:29,710 --> 02:52:31,270
That's why people have chainsaws.

2910
02:52:31,570 --> 02:52:34,690
You want to be able to push further
into the woods away from these fuckheads

2911
02:52:35,540 --> 02:52:38,200
could be possible. Right.
To them and thinking, man,

2912
02:52:38,290 --> 02:52:42,820
doing a lot of thinking lately come
up with shit like that. That's right.

2913
02:52:43,810 --> 02:52:45,550
Like sense. Right. Totally makes sense.

2914
02:52:46,660 --> 02:52:48,070
MMM.

2915
02:52:48,130 --> 02:52:51,160
What else? What else we got here
that I wanted to talk about? Uh,

2916
02:52:51,161 --> 02:52:52,360
the android phone thing.
Oh,

2917
02:52:52,361 --> 02:52:56,010
seaworld has oracle week to
see seaworld needs to just

2918
02:52:56,080 --> 02:52:59,110
stop, just stop talking. You know,

2919
02:52:59,111 --> 02:53:01,690
like if every time they open
their mouth about stuff like that,

2920
02:53:02,020 --> 02:53:03,670
every time they say something like,
you know,

2921
02:53:03,671 --> 02:53:04,990
wherever an oracle week
or something like that,

2922
02:53:04,991 --> 02:53:08,080
you're just opening yourself up for
this wave of negative publicity.

2923
02:53:08,450 --> 02:53:10,410
Have you seen the commercials
lately where they're like, well,

2924
02:53:10,411 --> 02:53:15,160
you have not captured a way all
in 28 years. We talked about it,

2925
02:53:15,161 --> 02:53:18,210
man, it's, we talked about one
of the shows and I was like, wow,

2926
02:53:18,430 --> 02:53:20,080
imagine if that was slavery.
Yeah.

2927
02:53:20,230 --> 02:53:23,910
Imagine if you said that we haven't
slaved a black van and over 35 years of

2928
02:53:23,911 --> 02:53:28,911
slaves we have here are all old fucked
up slaves that we won and a card game and

2929
02:53:31,181 --> 02:53:34,750
wild bill Hickok saloon. Yeah, it's rude.

2930
02:53:35,050 --> 02:53:37,930
It's rude and it's fucked up. It's
just, we just don't understand them,

2931
02:53:38,710 --> 02:53:40,970
but it's just amazing that they
don't realize that like they,

2932
02:53:40,971 --> 02:53:44,860
they should be trying to get out.
Like this is a toxic business you're in.

2933
02:53:44,890 --> 02:53:47,440
If you figured out how to be the,
the head of seaworld,

2934
02:53:47,800 --> 02:53:50,830
you could figure out a better way to
handle it. There's another way to do it.

2935
02:53:50,860 --> 02:53:54,640
There's another way to help
those things and conserve and,

2936
02:53:54,650 --> 02:53:58,330
and make it so that it's some
sort of a wildlife attraction.

2937
02:53:58,480 --> 02:54:03,480
Maybe perhaps work to engineer an
ecosphere where these animals are very

2938
02:54:04,751 --> 02:54:07,900
comfortable and you can do trips out
there to them and make it like a bigger

2939
02:54:07,901 --> 02:54:09,280
deal.
Like a Jurassic Park type.

2940
02:54:09,320 --> 02:54:11,880
Yeah. When did they create the
formula of c road? How long?

2941
02:54:11,881 --> 02:54:15,360
I see road Benanna women are
allowed to work yet. Like what? How

2942
02:54:17,220 --> 02:54:20,630
like the SEC 60 where they
ran out of people slavery.

2943
02:54:20,631 --> 02:54:22,040
So they went right to sea world.

2944
02:54:23,930 --> 02:54:27,010
I don't know. What if there
was a connection, it's a,
it's going to be, you know,

2945
02:54:27,020 --> 02:54:30,140
like Amber Lyon says they're gonna
end up on the wrong side of history.

2946
02:54:30,170 --> 02:54:31,340
That's a great expression.

2947
02:54:31,341 --> 02:54:35,990
She loves to use the wrong side of
history is a perfect way to describe this.

2948
02:54:36,110 --> 02:54:37,910
Like I,
you know,

2949
02:54:37,940 --> 02:54:42,230
just abandoning all guilt and blame
and all that. Let's just forget it.

2950
02:54:42,410 --> 02:54:45,230
Just forget it.
Let those fucking things go.

2951
02:54:45,650 --> 02:54:47,090
Just figuring out a way to let them go.

2952
02:54:47,360 --> 02:54:51,590
Figure out a way to engineer an enormous
bay where you can sort of keep them

2953
02:54:51,591 --> 02:54:55,400
nearby. Figure out a way to supply
them with food on a regular basis.

2954
02:54:55,401 --> 02:54:57,620
Figure out a way to communicate
with that with them.

2955
02:54:57,890 --> 02:55:01,070
Figuring out a way how to educate them
to get strong enough so they can start

2956
02:55:01,071 --> 02:55:01,970
hunting on their own.

2957
02:55:02,210 --> 02:55:06,340
Figure out a way how make it work because
the idea that you can take this super

2958
02:55:06,341 --> 02:55:09,590
intelligent being that might be as smart
as a person and the only way we could

2959
02:55:09,591 --> 02:55:13,100
ever enjoy that they're here is to put
them in a fucking swimming pool or the

2960
02:55:13,101 --> 02:55:16,340
fact that the people that enslave
them also love the ones that are free.

2961
02:55:16,950 --> 02:55:21,470
All right, you can't do it. I get
it. You're stuck. I get you're stuck.

2962
02:55:21,471 --> 02:55:24,050
You're backed into a corner by
the arguments you've made before.

2963
02:55:24,390 --> 02:55:27,260
You can't keep doing it. You can't
keep doing it. It's too fucked up.

2964
02:55:27,590 --> 02:55:29,750
Those things are smart as shit.
They just don't have fingers.

2965
02:55:30,020 --> 02:55:34,190
They don't have pens. They don't.
They don't print newspapers.

2966
02:55:34,220 --> 02:55:38,300
They don't leave behind a record, but
they're smart as shit. We know they are.

2967
02:55:38,510 --> 02:55:42,400
The idea that we're more important than
them to the point that we could put them

2968
02:55:42,401 --> 02:55:46,550
in a fucking fish tank or a swimming pool
or whatever the hell you want to call

2969
02:55:46,551 --> 02:55:48,980
those things. It's crazy. It
just doesn't make any sense.

2970
02:55:50,450 --> 02:55:54,650
They got to stop the idea that they
can keep doing this and that we don't,

2971
02:55:54,740 --> 02:55:55,041
you know,

2972
02:55:55,041 --> 02:55:59,000
we don't get completely outraged on
a regular basis that people are still

2973
02:55:59,001 --> 02:56:00,950
willing to go there.
Stop going there,

2974
02:56:01,820 --> 02:56:05,480
can't put dolphins in jail for
no fucking reason. Says wrong.

2975
02:56:05,970 --> 02:56:06,690
I think they're,
it's,

2976
02:56:06,690 --> 02:56:09,350
it's coming to the point where now
it's going to be illegal. I mean, look,

2977
02:56:09,510 --> 02:56:11,850
we started with transgenders
and then we went, you know,

2978
02:56:11,880 --> 02:56:13,260
dolphins in like 10 years.

2979
02:56:13,290 --> 02:56:15,930
We're going to fire and
transgender people to dolphins.

2980
02:56:16,170 --> 02:56:17,100
I'm just saying that there's,

2981
02:56:17,101 --> 02:56:21,630
in 10 years it's going to think you
make some awesome points to, hey,

2982
02:56:21,930 --> 02:56:24,250
have you checked out Paulie?
Tune a on he,

2983
02:56:24,260 --> 02:56:27,540
he's the one that always makes all
the cartoons based on the show.

2984
02:56:27,541 --> 02:56:31,320
He just released a new one,
the ranch one, Jesus Christ.

2985
02:56:31,680 --> 02:56:34,920
Talented as fuck, man. You want to
show a little bit of that? Yeah.

2986
02:56:34,950 --> 02:56:36,410
Well let's end with do
we have enough time to,

2987
02:56:36,460 --> 02:56:38,750
and with that it's about just
enough time to enlist. All right.

2988
02:56:38,760 --> 02:56:42,140
Goodnight everybody. A red
band. Uh, thanks for doing
this. There's a lot of fun.

2989
02:56:42,850 --> 02:56:45,900
We went to old school tonight, San
Jose, it might be there Thursday.

2990
02:56:46,240 --> 02:56:49,530
So as Dean and Dean del Rey and
Christian Spicer at the San Jose Improv.

2991
02:56:49,531 --> 02:56:54,190
So come out to do, we haven't done these
in forever. I know. It's fun holds.

2992
02:56:54,300 --> 02:56:57,870
Cool. All right, we're gonna play this
Paulie tune and then go fuck yourself.

2993
02:56:58,110 --> 02:56:59,670
I'll be back tomorrow with uh,

2994
02:56:59,700 --> 02:57:03,630
Chris and Carrick from mixed martial
arts.com the guys who created it and run

2995
02:57:03,631 --> 02:57:08,580
mixed martial arts.com. Exciting
Shit. Pitch Reebok and a,

2996
02:57:08,820 --> 02:57:13,650
how dare you. And we're going
to, uh, right now. Play this
and then get outta here.

2997
02:57:13,740 --> 02:57:16,770
All right. Thank you everybody. Thanks
everybody to came up to Chicago.

2998
02:57:16,771 --> 02:57:17,910
We had a great time.
Thank you.

2999
02:57:17,980 --> 02:57:21,830
You see guys much love. Bye
Bye. [inaudible] find the ranch.

3000
02:57:22,600 --> 02:57:24,110
You can't find the ranch one.
Yeah.

3001
02:57:28,120 --> 02:57:31,360
Are you still, are we still on the
air? Right by, by big kiss you fuck.

3002
02:57:31,361 --> 02:57:35,380
And we still in the air right before the
way you put on like really hitting on

3003
02:57:35,381 --> 02:57:38,530
mercury fillings in his mouth.
Just just look for blue

3004
02:57:38,570 --> 02:57:40,460
cheese with wings.
Go Fuck your mother.

3005
02:57:42,370 --> 02:57:46,930
All right. All right. You
Ready? Let's go. Okay,

3006
02:57:46,970 --> 02:57:50,380
crank out. That's China. That's
already in China. I this is, it's an,

3007
02:57:50,420 --> 02:57:51,253
I have it on mine.

3008
02:57:51,530 --> 02:57:52,650
Oh,
I don't have it off.

3009
02:57:52,651 --> 02:57:55,380
Yesterday I was saying how Joey
d will get mad about ketchup

3010
02:57:57,070 --> 02:58:01,350
because there'll be wanting to come up
with this fucking Heinz Ketchup or ranch.

3011
02:58:01,470 --> 02:58:01,980
Have you ever heard,
been

3012
02:58:01,980 --> 02:58:06,000
talking about ranch? Oh, fucking hate
rant. Fuck. People could eat that shit.

3013
02:58:06,780 --> 02:58:10,050
I don't know how people could eat ranch.
I like when I go to a place and I say,

3014
02:58:10,051 --> 02:58:12,930
you all, you have wings and
they say cubs with rent.

3015
02:58:12,960 --> 02:58:15,090
I get up and leave even
if I don't get the wings.

3016
02:58:15,480 --> 02:58:17,310
Because if you're going
to serve wings ranch,

3017
02:58:17,311 --> 02:58:21,150
I don't want to do business with you,
but I want to do business with you.

3018
02:58:21,750 --> 02:58:26,250
I'm very easy. I'm very fucking easy.
So if you fucked up pork fried rice,

3019
02:58:26,251 --> 02:58:29,460
what do we got to talk about? Wings must
be done with blue cheese. Blue Cheese.

3020
02:58:29,461 --> 02:58:31,200
Yeah, like the way that
they invented in Buffalo,

3021
02:58:31,201 --> 02:58:32,380
New York and you got to do something.

3022
02:58:33,120 --> 02:58:35,280
Whatever original you're going
to show up with that rant.

3023
02:58:35,281 --> 02:58:38,910
That's most like somebody says you have
a small branch is starting to replace

3024
02:58:38,911 --> 02:58:39,930
ketchup. Yeah, that's good.

3025
02:58:39,960 --> 02:58:43,140
If you're a fucking hillbilly and you
want the taste of ass in your mouth,

3026
02:58:43,141 --> 02:58:46,230
don't fucking debt. I hate
that fucker. Read Shit.

3027
02:58:46,590 --> 02:58:50,660
Don't put it close to me and I'll put it
around me and see the blue cheese with

3028
02:58:50,661 --> 02:58:53,730
wings and go fuck your mother. That's
the next year. All right, please.

3029
02:58:56,820 --> 02:59:00,640
You're going to give me a fucking low.
I'll ranch with fuck away. I can say, Ooh,

3030
02:59:00,800 --> 02:59:05,040
Jesus. Fuck your mother.
Go fuck this shit.

3031
02:59:05,460 --> 02:59:07,490
Fucking got to give me
branch with my wings.

3032
02:59:12,580 --> 02:59:15,320
Let tell you mother fuckers.
I'm stoked. The fucking

3033
02:59:19,020 --> 02:59:19,830
cheeses.
Wigs.

3034
02:59:19,830 --> 02:59:24,150
You go fuck your mother fucking
getting into ranch shit.
