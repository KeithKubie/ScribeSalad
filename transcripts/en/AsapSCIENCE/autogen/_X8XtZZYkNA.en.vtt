 This episode was supported by Skillshare. 

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.450
 Have you ever wondered how your brain would be better than the brains around you? 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.139
 Well, if you are taller than those who stand by them, you may be smarter. 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.059
 The researchers found that people who are taller are often the ones with higher incomes. 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.229
 Which is supposed to be linked to self-esteem, social control 

00:00:17.229 --> 00:00:18.359
 Or intolerance against the shortest people. 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.269
 However, a study in 2009 indicated that older children have more 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:23.979
 Highest scores in cognitive tests. 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.280
 Or maybe you'll be the oldest among your brothers; 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.320
 A study of 250,000 Norwegian military personnel found that the eldest son 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.580
 He has an intelligence average of 2.3 points higher than his younger siblings. 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.460
 This is not a genetic rule; it is a result of the parents' full interest in the early. 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.940
 Did you get your food by breast feeding or bottle of milk when you were a child? 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.630
 A Brazilian study tracked more than 3,000 children to the age of 30. 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.060
 The researchers found that the duration and amount of breastfeeding is positively related 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.230
 Intelligence, learning and income. 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.840
 Speaking about drinking, drinking alcohol is bad for your brain, right? 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.250
 Perhaps, but the most intelligent among us are the most likely to drink alcohol. 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.880
 A study found that smart children in both the United Kingdom and the United States 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.600
 They were more likely to consume alcohol in their old age 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.549
 Similarly, another study assessed the IQ of 6713 people aged 11 years and followed them up to the age of 42, 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.549
 The same was true for drug abuse such as cannabis, cocaine and amphetamines 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:16.850
 And magic mushrooms. 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.630
 Why do smart people resort to substances that may cause harm? 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.399
 There is a hypothesis known as the Savannah-IQ hypothesis and assumes that the most intelligent people 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.940
 They have unusual values ​​and priorities. 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.940
 For example, most of us do our best during daylight hours 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.560
 The uncommon time will be at night. 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.060
 Therefore, the hypothesis states that the night people are the most intelligent among us, 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.530
 This was confirmed by the longitudinal study of adolescent health. 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.880
 If you find this information disturbing, it is likely ... you are very vigilant. 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.689
 In a sample of 126 university students, verbal intelligence was found to be a positive indicator 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.900
 To worry and think. 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.950
 On the other hand, a person who does not worry about scoring high scores in the test of nonverbal intelligence. 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.960
 Do you like daydreams? 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.060
 A new study found that dreamers may be smarter, suggesting that people with effective minds 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.299
 The capacity of their brains is greater than stopping thinking. 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:06.299
 Left-handed? 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.070
 A study involving 96 left-handed and 96 right-hand people, the result was left-handed 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.860
 They scored higher degrees of creativity and also in differentiated thinking measures, that is, the ability to create new ideas 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.150
 Of one principle. 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.250
 If you want to develop your intelligence with your own hands, you do not have to decide whether you are right or right 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.010
 He turned towards music lessons. 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:32.000
 A study showed that verbal intelligence improved in 90% of preschool children after only 20 days of music training. 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.060
 While you are in the midst of this, quit smoking. 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.340
 Unlike other risks, a study of 20,221 young people aged 18 from the Israeli army 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.750
 I found that IQ was lower in smokers compared to non-smokers. 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.260
 Maybe abstinence is the reason? 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.610
 The study evaluated 12,000 adolescents in grades 7-12, and found that students 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.440
 Top IQ owners did not often have sex. 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.690
 Another study found that this would extend for years to come. 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.880
 In the United States, 80% of boys and 75% of girls lose their virginity at the age of 19, 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.340
 While 87% of university students lose it. 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.470
 However, these figures are lower in elite universities 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:15.540
 At Princeton University 56% of her students had sex, 59% at Harvard, and 51% at MIT. 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.480
 Finally, do you find this picture funny? * In the picture: "Every apple every day .. And will die anyway" 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.980
 Congratulations, the dark comedy you have is positively associated with intelligence, 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.500
 Regardless of age and gender. 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.090
 It is important to remember that the link does not equal causality, but it is interesting 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.540
 To check the variables related to intelligence. 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.950
 How many variables apply to you? 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.400
 Tell us that in the comments, if they apply to your experiences with the smart people you know.

 I have personally experimented with the development of visual effects and editing skills. 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.720
 It has been a great advance for me. 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.110
 Currently enrolled in a writing course, 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.480
 I try to write different things, like comedy scenes. 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.050
