00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.560
Create a graph of the
linear equation 5x plus 2y

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.154
is equal to 20.

00:00:06.154 --> 00:00:07.570
So the line is
essentially the set

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.650
of all coordinate,
all x's and y's, that

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.024
satisfy this relationship
right over here.

00:00:13.024 --> 00:00:14.940
To make things simpler,
what we're going to do

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.050
is set up a table
where we're going

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.091
to put a bunch of x values
in and then figure out

00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:20.421
the corresponding y value
based on this relationship.

00:00:20.421 --> 00:00:21.920
But to make it a
little bit simpler,

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.760
I'm going to solve for y here.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.740
So it becomes easier to
solve for y for any given x.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.130
So we have 5x plus
2y is equal to 20.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.990
If we want to solve
for y, let's just

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.800
get rid of the 5x on
the left-hand side.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.880
So let's subtract 5x from
both sides of this equation.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.800
The left-hand side,
these guys cancel out,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.680
so we get 2y is equal
to the right hand side,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.530
you have 20 minus 5x.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.430
And then you can divide both
sides of this equation by 2.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.950
So you divide both sides by 2.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.330
The left-hand side, we
just have a y, and then

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.590
the right-hand side, we
could leave it that way.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.714
That actually would be a
pretty straightforward way

00:01:01.714 --> 00:01:04.260
to leave it, or we could
call this 20 divided by 2

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.376
is 10 minus 5x over 2
or minus 5/2 times x.

00:01:10.376 --> 00:01:11.750
And so now using
this, let's just

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.473
come up with a bunch
of x values and see

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:17.150
what the corresponding y values
are, and then just plot them.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.210
So let me do this
in a new color.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.470
So let me-- a slightly
different shade of yellow.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.630
So we have x values,
and then let's

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.910
think about what
the corresponding y

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.347
value is going to be.

00:01:27.347 --> 00:01:29.180
So I'll start, well, I
could start anywhere.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.180
I'll start at x is equal
to 0, just because that

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.960
tends to keep things
pretty simple.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:39.440
If x is 0, then y is equal
to 10 minus 5/2 times

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.600
0, which is equal to
5/2 times 0 is just a 0.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.290
So it's just 10 minus 0 or 10.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.800
So that gives us the coordinate,
the point, 0 comma 10.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.280
When x is 0, y is 10.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.310
So x is 0.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.870
So it's going to be right here
at the middle of the x-axis.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.050
And you go up 10 for
the y-coordinate.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.390
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.360
So it's right over here.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.390
So that's the point 0 comma 10.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.940
Let's do another point.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.550
Let's say that x is 2.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.140
I'm going to pick
multiples of 2 here

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.760
just so that I get a
nice clean answer here.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:28.640
So when x is 2, then y is
equal to 10 minus 5/2 times 2,

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.680
and the 2 in the
denominator cancels out

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.510
with this 2 in the numerator.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.990
So it simplifies to
10 minus 5, or just 5.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.720
So that tells us the point
x equals 2, y is equal to 5,

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.890
is on the line.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.600
So 2x is equal to 1,
2 right over here.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.920
And then y is equal to 5.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.900
You go up 5.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.100
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, just like that.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.749
So that's the point 2, 5.

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:57.540
And when you're drawing
a line you actually

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.415
just need two points.

00:02:58.415 --> 00:03:00.456
If you have a ruler or
any kind of straight edge,

00:03:00.456 --> 00:03:02.140
we could just connect
these two points.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.200
And if we do it neatly,
every point on that line

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.830
should satisfy this
relationship right here.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.010
Just so we get practice,
I'll do more points.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.280
So let me do, let's say
when x is equal to 4,

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.750
then y is equal to
10 minus 5/2 times 4.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.100
This is equal to 5/2 times 4.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.760
This is equal to 10, right?

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.110
Because the 2, divide the
denominator by 2 you get 1,

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.062
divide the numerator by
2 you get 2, or 4 over 2

00:03:31.062 --> 00:03:32.020
is the same thing as 2.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.050
So it becomes 2 times 5
is 10, 10 minus 10 is 0.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.850
So the point 4 comma
0 is on our line.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.130
So x is 1, 2, 3,
4, and then y is 0.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.990
So we don't move up at
all, so we have 4 comma 0.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.060
And I could keep going.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.147
I could try other points.

00:03:53.147 --> 00:03:55.230
You could do them if you
like, but this is plenty.

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.646
Just two of these would have
been enough to draw the line.

00:03:57.646 --> 00:04:00.250
So let me just draw it.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.740
So I'll do it in white.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.840
So the line will look
something like this.

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.246
And I could keep going
in both directions.

00:04:15.246 --> 00:04:16.120
So there you have it.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.410
That is the graph of
our linear equation.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.480
Let me make my line
a little bit bolder,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.197
just in case you found that
first line hard to read.

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:25.780
So let me make it a
little bit bolder.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.520
And I think you get
the general idea.
