00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.455
So now that we understand
how services work,

00:00:02.455 --> 00:00:05.950
let's review how Android 
determines your app's priority.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.270
App priority is divided
into three general buckets.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.463
Critical, high, and low.

00:00:12.463 --> 00:00:15.626
Within each bucket the apps
are prioritized in a queue,

00:00:15.626 --> 00:00:18.800
with the app that's been
at the lowest priority for the longest

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.920
the first to be executed.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.030
Critical apps are those
that are active.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.530
They're in the foreground, 
interacting with users.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:27.550
That includes activities
in the foreground,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.993
and apps running 
foreground services.

00:00:29.993 --> 00:00:33.146
High priority apps, 
include any visible activities,

00:00:33.146 --> 00:00:35.520
and any application
with a running service.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.050
While less impactful than 
killing a foreground app,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.340
destroying visible activities
or cancelling services running tasks

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.833
like background updates,

00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:45.116
is still going to be noticeable to users.

00:00:45.116 --> 00:00:48.620
So, the system will only kill them
in an extreme resource crunch.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.520
Apps in the background though,

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.550
they're the red shirted ensigns
of the app priority landing party.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.950
Any background app
will be killed as needed

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.110
in a last seen, first killed order,

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.080
in order to help support
the higher priority apps.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.409
I like to think of this 
as the three laws

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.659
of Android resource management.

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.179
Law one, Android will keep
all apps that interact with the user

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:11.640
running smoothly.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.146
Android will keep all apps
with visible activities

00:01:14.146 --> 00:01:18.772
or running services running, 
unless doing so violates the first law.

00:01:18.772 --> 00:01:22.630
And third, Android will keep all apps
in the background running,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.410
unless this violates 
the first or second laws.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.040
So with all of that in mind, 
consider these four apps.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.910
What do you think 
is the priority order

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.720
of each of these apps, 
according to the system?
