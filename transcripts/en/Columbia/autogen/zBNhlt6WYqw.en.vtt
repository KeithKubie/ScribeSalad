00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:11.380
[Classical music plays]

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.920
For thirty years, Miller
Theater has been a nexus of creativity and

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.699
experimentation here on the columbia campus,

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.649
and as we celebrate this milestone anniversary,
we honor the legacy of the arts at Columbia.

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:27.859
From landmark works by Martha Graham and Aaron
Copland and Charles Ives

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:33.150
that took place right here in this very building,
and also the bold, adventurous work that has

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.289
made Miller Theater what it is and what it
will be going forward.

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:41.690
and so, while we’re very excited about Miller
Theater being thirty, what’s even more exciting

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.530
is the fact that it ties this important legacy
of

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.829
the arts at Columbia University.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.179
We open Miller Theater’s 30th anniversary
season with the very anticipated New York

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.160
premiere of

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.859
“Proving Up,” It’s a New Chamber Opera
from the creative team of Missy Mazzoli and

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:56.859
Royce Vavrek

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.231
Missy Mazzoli: Miller Theater has an amazing
history of presenting amazing work, and Columbia

00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:05.340
has an amazing history of presenting new opera,
you know, all the way back to Virgil Thomson.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.680
So I’m really thrilled that Miller is
commissioning this work, co-commissioning

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.229
this work and they’re one of the first presenters--
the first presenter in New York City and is

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.490
thrilled to be a part of that legacy.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.430
Melissa Smey: So we’re commissioning six
new works for the coming season, the co-commission

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.110
of the chamber opera for opening night, we’re
commissioning two of the composers

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.970
in the composer portraits series, both
Wang Lu and Tyshawn Sorey

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:35.579
Tyshawn Sorey: In this portraits concert I’m
extremely excited to present a version that

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.189
will be commissioned by Miller Theater called
“Autoschediasms” for creative chamber

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:41.189
orchestra

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.729
I’m absolutely thrilled to present my
music here at home I would say, at Columbia

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:47.729
University.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.590
Collaboration is at the heart of what
we do at Miller Theater, and it’s certainly

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.789
at the heart of my programming philosophy
and the way that I work with emerging artists

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.810
and ensembles, faculty, students,

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.929
and so we regularly partner, particularly
with faculty, on a variety

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:03.990
of initiatives at Miller Theater

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.490
for the coming season we’re going to be
collaborating quite closely with George Lewis

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.190
who’s composing a new work for us in a new
keyboard series that we have.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.380
We’ve been honored to work in the past with
faculty including Professor Bob O’Meally

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.420
who’s a really key partner for us
in Morningside Lights, and it’s core to

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.420
what we do here

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.140
at Miller Theater, those collaborations.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.270
Zosha Di Castri: So when my undergraduates
come to me and ask a little bit about where

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.800
to go see concerts in New York or how to sort
of get introduced to

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.020
music scenes, often I tell them Miller
Theater is a great place to start because

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.390
they have such a breadth of programming, they
have a lot of diversity of voices,

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.800
which I really appreciate, and they do a lot
of educational and outreach work too which

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.020
I think is great.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.300
And so, you know, in classes where they’re
learning-- students are learning from

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.800
early music all the way to the present, we
really get that scope in the programming

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.100
MM: The composer portraits series is really
unique in that I think it’s the only series

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.970
of its kind in New York city, and it’s a
place where you can go to discover the newest

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:06.970
voices

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.260
and to hear really established composers in
a totally new context, and to hear them do

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.550
things that are maybe more risky or challenging

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.560
um, and to hear a lot of their work all at
one time

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.980
ZDC: Being featured on the portraits series
at Miller Theater was a big moment for me

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.880
having studied here in New York

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.960
I attended a lot of those concerts.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.910
And I think for me it was also an important
moment to

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.880
sort of to believe I was doing this as my profession,
not just sort of as a student

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.850
TS: Columbia University and Miller Theater
represent a major transition in my development

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.020
as a composer

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.550
I’ve studied with both George Lewis and
Fred

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.940
and so Columbia University and Miller Theater,
they represent this trajectory, this trajectory

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.950
in which I’ve

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.380
advanced my compositional language
MS: so today Dodge Hall, the building that

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.390
we are in is the arts building on the Morningside
campus, it’s home to Miller Theater, it’s

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.740
also home to Columbia University’s school
of the arts,

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.960
but when it originally opened, it was home
to the business school.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.480
And this space that we’re in now was Macmillan
Academic Theater and I think that legacy

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.470
of a commitment to contemporary music, you
know, it didn’t start with Miller Theater,

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.189
that’s been part of the core of the arts
at Columbia

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:26.949
going all the way back to the beginning of
this building which is so important.

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:31.320
And we’re thrilled really to honor the legacy
of the arts at Columbia University in the

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.260
work that we’re doing here.
