1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,500
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. Hi, I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is radio lab and today

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,790
we begin on a plane. Thank you Brooke,

3
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:12,350
which carried our newly married
producer Tim Howard to the Galapagos.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,890
So I took the plane from Quito.

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,930
We had just finished the
honeymoon that morning.

6
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,460
They make announcements and the
certain point, the flight attendants,

7
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:32,120
they open up all of the overhead bins
and they walk up and down spraying some

8
00:00:32,121 --> 00:00:36,460
sort of insecticide for what? For like uh,

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,420
invasive species I think. Yeah,

10
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:40,670
like whatever bugs might've
snuck on in the brain.

11
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,400
But at this point I'm
getting super excited and I'm
thinking about Darwin and I

12
00:00:46,401 --> 00:00:48,800
start reading voyage of the Beagle,

13
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,470
his book on this nook that
I had bought for the trip,

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,830
but then my power supply
didn't work and my nook died.

15
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:59,360
Does a big problem for Darren to
run out of power. His book. Oh God.

16
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,400
And then the islands come into site.

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,530
What is the color of the Pacific Ocean
when you look up the plane window?

18
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:10,130
That was actually the first thing
I noticed. It's this totally wild,

19
00:01:10,131 --> 00:01:13,580
like I've never seen like
this story book, blue,

20
00:01:13,581 --> 00:01:18,440
green iridescent aqua marine
and I'm thinking like, wow,

21
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,460
this is going to be like dropping
into another world, you know,

22
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:24,230
like nature and its purest form.

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,130
My version was is my dream and what it
would be like is you landed on it and

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,140
it's sort of like low grassy knoll
and an enormous turtle comes by.

25
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,260
The one that you could sit on the top of
it and it wouldn't notice that you were

26
00:01:36,261 --> 00:01:39,470
there just going to meet to the airport
just wandering by and basically that's

27
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:41,000
very similar to what I was

28
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,540
picturing, but maybe we need to land,

29
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:47,650
we take the 40 minute
bus ride to play for Yara

30
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:55,230
or Toyota, which turns out
to be kind of a big town.

31
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:58,920
Tons of people live there. It's
like a fishing village. Tons. No,

32
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:00,750
it's way bigger than a fishing village.

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,880
And just let me say that my first hours
in Galapagos were totally different than

34
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:06,714
I was expecting.

35
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,700
I'm sort of the first thing that
really just like, where the hell am I?

36
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,180
I am walking through the towns kind
of late Sun is just starting to set me

37
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,970
actually walking down to
Charles Darwin Avenue,

38
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,310
just kind of getting the lay of
the land. When all of a sudden

39
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:40,900
[inaudible] this line of cars
comes around the corner honking,

40
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:46,150
endless honking and they're waving flags,

41
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,000
blue flags. At first I didn't
know what that was happening,

42
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:50,380
but turns out it was an election

43
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,540
and I was just really blown away that
this continued this procession for like 15

44
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,093
minutes.

45
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,890
And I remember asking him one guy on
the up though, they're driving so slow,

46
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:08,590
I can just walk up to them and say,
I'm, I've got it. Oh, I sold a car.

47
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:09,910
I'm like, who's your
candidate? And they're like,

48
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,930
I didn't know who the guy was,

49
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:16,770
but it turns out he was the incumbent
and I'm like, fucking it up.

50
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,470
Is he going to win? And this guy
he like doesn't even say anything.

51
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:23,950
He just kind of points you like points
at the cars in front and behind as if

52
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:28,240
like, dude, seriously. You
see how many of us there are?

53
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:34,630
But then at a certain point I noticed
this one guy by himself standing on the

54
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:38,740
sidewalk wearing a white shirt
and jeans. He's waving a flag,

55
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,210
but his flag is a different color.
It's white and it's really loud.

56
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:47,890
But I go up to him and I yell at him,
who is your candidate? And he said,

57
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,050
I am a candidate. And I'm
like, what are you seriously?

58
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,810
So his name is Leon

59
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,630
[inaudible] [inaudible]
he is a naturalist guide.

60
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,800
You actually ended up meeting a lot of
people employed that way in Galapagos and

61
00:04:04,801 --> 00:04:09,150
he tells me so old, so young, outsider,
politically, politically speaking,

62
00:04:09,151 --> 00:04:10,350
he's an outsider.

63
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,370
And of course I'm wondering why he's
standing there by himself waving a flag at

64
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:19,290
this entire parade of people who don't
support him at all. And he tells me,

65
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,420
cl Momento I'm nervous.

66
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,170
[inaudible] if the party in power now
the front runners, if they get elected,

67
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,183
they will

68
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,930
[inaudible] [inaudible] and I
see a dark and uncertain future.

69
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,480
Grand Hotel is more big hotels,
more of these enormous boats,

70
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:44,510
more people [inaudible] if
things keep going this way,

71
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,430
who's going to stand up for nature?

72
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,340
This is Radiolab and we are dedicating
the entire hour to this little set of

73
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:56,080
islands. And to that question,

74
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,890
as the world is filling up with
more and more and more people,

75
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:02,260
is it inevitable that
even the most sacred,

76
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:06,070
pristine places on the planet
will eventually get swallowed up?

77
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,170
And how far are we willing to go to return
a place to what it was before we got

78
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:14,650
there? And more importantly, can we,

79
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,640
oh, I'm never a doubter.
Okay, so this is Linda.

80
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,050
Linda Caio currently the science
advisor for Galapagos Conservancy.

81
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,820
I began my work in Galapagos in 1981
she first came to study tortoise's.

82
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,750
Back then, you know,
Galapagos was really isolated,

83
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,090
barely any cars, super
limited electricity.

84
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:40,230
All I remember is having a smile on
my face all the time because you know,

85
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:43,480
as a biologist going to
Galapagos is like going to Mecca.

86
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,560
[inaudible]

87
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,060
she says you have islands with
massive volcanoes, forests,

88
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:54,140
tree ferns that grow, you know,
well above a human's height.

89
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:58,000
Yeah, I mean powerful. You know, there's

90
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:01,790
green mangroves, baklava
flows and pink flamingos.

91
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,820
This is Mateus Espinosa, a
naturalist guide in the Galapagos.

92
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,990
And like Linda, he says that when he
first got to the Galapagos in the 80s,

93
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:13,080
he couldn't believe that the place
was real to his breast taken.

94
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,730
He visited an island called

95
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:20,010
if an Andina and the first thing that
I saw was a lava fluid was moving.

96
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:26,910
I said, what's going on? You No,
no, no, that's lava throws her leg.

97
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,140
1000 CE Guan as taking a sunbath

98
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,260
and he says he would go on these dive.

99
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,590
Can you imagine

100
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,320
schools of hammerhead sharks like 508
tendent passing in front of you like tuna?

101
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,690
I mean like, like sardines.
It shows you the power.

102
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:51,890
It shows your old for evolution. There
is where evolution is very strong.

103
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,550
Okay, so quick context, uh, Galapagos
islands, cluster of islands,

104
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:02,030
way off the coast of Ecuador in
the Pacific, 19 bigger islands,

105
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,840
bunch of smaller ones. And this
is the place, of course, we're,

106
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:09,850
Darwin landed in 1835 and
as he went island to island,

107
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,930
he started noticing that there were all
these creatures that were really similar

108
00:07:14,931 --> 00:07:17,690
to each other, but also
a little bit different.

109
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,520
The tortoise's had different shells
depending on the kind of island they lived

110
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:24,140
on. The finches look similar,

111
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:27,410
but their peaks were always a little bit
different. And this gets him thinking,

112
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:30,470
what if it isn't the way
that everybody always says?

113
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,030
What if God didn't create every single
species in the beginning and leave them

114
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:38,600
unchanged? What if in fact
life is purely change?

115
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,330
What if everything has
been changing all the time?

116
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,790
Darwin's five weeks on Galapagos pushed
him to develop his theory of evolution.

117
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,730
And that's also why when
we think of evolution,

118
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:52,130
we think of the Galapagos
and in particular

119
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,110
we think of two iconic
creatures, the tortoise

120
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,220
and the fence.

121
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,620
Let me start by telling you about
the tortoise. It's hot, it's bright.

122
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:12,900
It's such a perfect day for
tortoise. Something are not hunting.

123
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,250
But you know, looking for
fourth day I was there, um,

124
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,140
I went to the island of Floriana,

125
00:08:19,141 --> 00:08:23,760
which Darwin visited and they're up in
the highlands basically in the middle of

126
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:25,650
this yard. Oh my God.

127
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:32,390
There are these three massive tortoises
just clustered together under a tree.

128
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,120
Wow. That is fricking amazing.
Describe them. What are they look like?

129
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:43,200
These are such alien looking creatures.
They are like the size of, Geez,

130
00:08:43,201 --> 00:08:44,760
I don't even know what they're massive.

131
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,160
They look like they
would crush you to death.

132
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,840
Well now how many years these
guys have been here for?

133
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,110
They can live for over 150
years. Wow. This is a tour.

134
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,400
It is trying to get over a branch.

135
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,103
[inaudible]

136
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,080
who is that? That is a
sound of a tortoise breathe.

137
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,203
That's cool.

138
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,950
So Linda,

139
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,910
when she first went to Galapagos to
study these torts is about 30 years ago.

140
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,360
I did a trip where we
backpacked around the Caldera.

141
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:19,110
She took a trip to this island called
Isabella hiked up the side of a volcano

142
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,730
and looked at all the tortoise country
and it was an impenetrable forest,

143
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,340
basically tortoise heaven.

144
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,400
And what makes it so perfect for tortoises
is in the dry season in Galapagos

145
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:36,360
that go Roula, which is a very, very
thick mist, comes onto the island.

146
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,260
It rolls over this forest and it
catches in the branches of the tree.

147
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:47,010
The water then drips down from the
top of the trees down to the ground.

148
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,070
Creating what we call drip pools,

149
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:56,230
which provides tortoises with water during
the dry season and they like to rest

150
00:09:57,021 --> 00:09:57,854
in water.

151
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:02,840
And so there under the trees you have
these ponds with dozens of tortoise domes

152
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:04,430
just rising out of the water.

153
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:11,000
So that was my first experience. It
was a magical, magical area. And then,

154
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,380
um,

155
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,490
I actually didn't get back there for
maybe 15 years from when I was there the

156
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:17,324
first time.

157
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,900
And when I returned that
forest was 100% gone.

158
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,250
The drip pools were just
dry dust bowls. Wow.

159
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,960
There was no shade tortoises where
we're sitting out in the sun or,

160
00:10:35,961 --> 00:10:39,200
or crowded around the couple of
stalks that were still there.

161
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,700
This is Carl Campbell.

162
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,690
I work for island conservation and I'm
based here in the Galapagos Islands.

163
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,410
Carl was actually the guy who showed me
those tortoises. It was just a, yeah,

164
00:10:48,411 --> 00:10:52,400
it was a barren landscape.
Yeah. Barren, barren grounds.

165
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,990
What happened to the
forest? Um, goats. Goats.

166
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:00,470
And that was definitely not what
I thought you were going to say.

167
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,260
I thought you were gonna say people,
it was kind of a collaboration.

168
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,670
So here's the story.

169
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,960
Goats were originally sort of
brought to the Galapagos, um,

170
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,720
probably by pirates and wireless
back in the 15 hundreds.

171
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:16,860
You had tons of sailors making these,
these long voyages across the Pacific.

172
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,950
And uh, Galapagos was
the, a, the major port on,

173
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,910
on the wailing route and where,
yeah, you'd come and get fresh water,

174
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:29,010
but you'd also come in and pick up a
tortoise's land tortoises and Yang boats

175
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:33,780
and take away several hundred of them
often and turn them upside down and they

176
00:11:33,781 --> 00:11:37,220
can last for up to a year and a
half in the whole of the ship. Like

177
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,990
lying there upside down. Yeah,

178
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,860
lying there upside down in order
to make space for the tortoise's.

179
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,730
The whalers and pirates would often take
goats that they'd brought with them and

180
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:47,780
throw them onto the islands.

181
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:51,380
That way when they're on their way
back and sick of eating tortoises,

182
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:56,230
they could grab those goats.
So whalers and Buccaneers,

183
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,220
they introduced goats to Galapagos.
But on islands like Isabella,

184
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,310
which is this massive
island size of Rhode Island,

185
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,780
the goats were actually penned in to just
a little part of it because there was

186
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:10,730
this black lava rock that
ran across the island,

187
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,670
[inaudible] rough lava that's extremely
difficult to walk across 12 miles of it.

188
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,870
So that had acted as a barrier basically
with goats on one side toward us on the

189
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:22,070
other. But according to Linda,

190
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:26,770
some time in the late
1970s the goats got brave.

191
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,200
We were probably talking just a few goats.

192
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:31,510
Bye.

193
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,110
The 1990s those few goats,

194
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,460
the population had exploded. And
you need about 100,000 to go.

195
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:46,030
And if you think of 100,000 goats
eating everything in their path,

196
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,260
every sort of plant, even the bark
off of trees, they destroy the forest.

197
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:56,870
So now they had a dilemma. On the
one hand, the tortoise's needed help.

198
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:57,763
On the other hand,

199
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,700
you had all of these goats that didn't
choose to be on the island. You know,

200
00:13:01,701 --> 00:13:05,420
it wasn't their fault. And the goats
that were out there were gorgeous.

201
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,250
You know, they had curled horns,

202
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,140
different colored for just beautiful
animals and they'd been there for 500

203
00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:12,974
years.

204
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:16,910
Some people were concerned, you know,
with the goats have their own sort of,

205
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,410
if you will, right to be there.

206
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,400
Those arguments came up frequently
to which Carl would respond. Yeah.

207
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,920
Are we going to let
tortoise's go extinct? Yeah.

208
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,950
There's thousands of islands around
the world that have goats on them.

209
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,980
These tortoises are only found
here. So where do your values lie?

210
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:32,770
[inaudible]

211
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:37,770
and so in 1994 we had what we called the
tortoise summit in England and that was

212
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:43,060
where we started the discussions
about what are we gonna do?

213
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,880
Experts came from all over
the world. Linda says,

214
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,080
we want to get rid of the goats.

215
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,860
And many of them thought we were
nuts and that it was impossible.

216
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,480
There's 100,000 of them. So many doubters.
Carl says he even heard the idea,

217
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,950
why don't you put lines?

218
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,360
Yeah, they eat goats in Africa. You
know, why don't you get lions on there?

219
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:03,910
And those are, you know,
really interesting ideas.

220
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:07,000
But at some point they're going to get
hungry and they're going to start eating

221
00:14:07,001 --> 00:14:10,870
all the other things that yeah, you
treasure by the occasional tourist.

222
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,820
In any case, after endless planning
and meetings took eight years,

223
00:14:16,821 --> 00:14:18,500
I think they commence

224
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,080
project Isabella,

225
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,710
so the helicopters we used,

226
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:30,660
they're called MD five hundreds small
helicopter there for four passengers with

227
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:34,750
one pilot, single turbine, five blades.
This is Frasier Fraser Sutherland.

228
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:39,810
I was the engineer pilot and a sharp
shooter 2004 through to 2006 almost every

229
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,060
day. During that time Frazier
would fly over Isabella island.

230
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,000
Two guys were two shooters are
the side of the helicopter.

231
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:49,870
What you do is so you come across and
you're flying along and you might see one

232
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:53,180
guy says, you follow that go as
it ran away till join his friends.

233
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,940
Do you have to find all those
other guides? Circle of real low.

234
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,900
You'd fly around them, around them up,
try and get them in a single group,

235
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,273
and then

236
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:08,240
you start picking off the
goats one by one by one.

237
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:12,930
And there are actually videos online
where you see these packs of goes

238
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:18,240
running for their lives and
then dropping to the ground.

239
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The last goat or two might sort of run
into a area where it's impossible to

240
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:26,840
read.

241
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:31,030
I would actually go into caves and what
we'd do is we'd find a location as close

242
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,530
as we could or right on top of the cave,

243
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,860
drop out one of the two shooters that
was in the helicopter and he'd physically

244
00:15:35,861 --> 00:15:39,160
go into the cave, shoot the goats out,

245
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,230
or shoot them on site.

246
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:46,600
And then you go on and actually in
under a year through this aerial attack,

247
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,570
they end up wiping out 90%
of the goats on Isabella.

248
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,400
But to give an example of the nature
of this business, that's Josh Donlin,

249
00:15:54,401 --> 00:15:57,010
he runs an NGO that was
involved in project Isabella.

250
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:02,140
It's relatively easy to remove 90%
of a goat population from an island.

251
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,450
But as they become rare and rare,
they're harder and harder to detect.

252
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,050
The goats become quote, educated.
They learn that this sound yeah

253
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,443
means

254
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:16,670
so the goats start hiding.
So they'll go onto bushes,

255
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:20,120
they won't move to learn to stand
under a tree, holding their breath.

256
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,880
And so you end up flying around and
an expensive helicopter not fighting.

257
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,520
And it goes. Now the way we deal
with that, it's an interesting one.

258
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:33,050
We use this technique
called Judas goats. Yeah,

259
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,790
Judas codes. Initially it was
Carl suggestion, buzz goats, uh,

260
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,770
a gregarious and like being in groups.
They're herd animals, right? And so,

261
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,980
uh, the technique that we would use was

262
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:51,340
fire up your helicopter. You fly around,
he'd find some, go to capture goats,

263
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:54,520
capture them, lie, and then
come back back to base camp,

264
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,950
offload them and

265
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,750
put a radio collar on him and
you throw him back on the island

266
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,713
and then you wait.

267
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:10,080
Instinctively that lone guy will
go and find out the goats a week.

268
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:14,160
Two weeks go by, you
fire up the helicopter,

269
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,740
they get back over to the
island with this little device,

270
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,170
it's a directional antenna.

271
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,820
Start Tracking the Judas go till they
spot it with some other goats and then

272
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,600
everyone gets shot except
the Judas go. They let it go,

273
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,920
finds more friends,

274
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:37,370
and then everyone gets shot except the
Judas go and then they do it again.

275
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,320
Everyone gets shot except the Judas
go. And you do that about every

276
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,630
two weeks for a year. Oh my God.

277
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,400
And that is how they go from 90% go free
to 91 to 92 to 93 to 94 [inaudible].

278
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,040
It's like having a pogrom on you
over and over and over again. Jesus.

279
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,580
It gets worse. Now Judas,

280
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:05,830
Skoda is a good Judas go until it gets
pregnant because then it doesn't want to

281
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:11,370
be social anymore. It goes off and
has this kid and is very solitary,

282
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,100
which is the last thing you want when
you're trying to get goats off islands.

283
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:17,670
So Carl kept mulling this problem.
What would it take to basically make,

284
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:22,530
you know, the perfect year disco,
the Ideal Judas Code, if you will,

285
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:23,430
um,

286
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,120
is it goat that would search for and be
searched for and that would never get

287
00:18:27,121 --> 00:18:27,600
pregnant.

288
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:32,600
So Carl Campbell figured out a technique
where we could sterilize them in the

289
00:18:33,031 --> 00:18:36,420
field. It grabbed the goats stardom
and then in a matter of minutes,

290
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,540
SnipSnap did you do this? Yeah. Well, I,

291
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:41,910
I stood next to Carl and watched him do it

292
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,440
and Carl took it one step further and
he actually gave these females hormone

293
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:53,040
implants, basically put them into
heat for an extended duration.

294
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,830
Normally a female goat would be in
heat for maybe a couple of days.

295
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,540
These females would go for more than
190 days. And wherever they went,

296
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:04,050
they would lower those male goats out
of their caves. So that, you know,

297
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,540
all in all over the course
of this two year program,

298
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,890
we had hundreds of Judas goats
out. And using those goats,

299
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:18,420
they were able to go from 94%
goat free to 96 to 97 to 98.

300
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,860
And basically when you have only Judas
goats meeting up with other Judas Coats,

301
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,520
then you can say the goats have been
eliminated. You're done a point.

302
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:29,790
They got to, at least
on Isabella in mid 2006,

303
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,143
uh,

304
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:38,660
this kind of eradication program was
far beyond anything that anyone had ever

305
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:39,700
done anywhere in the [inaudible]

306
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,130
because it turns out they weren't just
doing this on Isabella island. No,

307
00:19:48,131 --> 00:19:51,790
we're talking about island by island.
Over the course of about seven years,

308
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:55,030
they eliminate over 250,000 goats.

309
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,593
[inaudible]

310
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,460
so you, um,

311
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,390
you complete that with
Isabella and did at work.

312
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,210
Yeah. The results of this were absolutely
impressive. You had plants reemerging,

313
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,000
you had trees growing back, and
in a really short period of time,

314
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:19,890
and this allowed for those
important drip pools and tortoises,

315
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,870
they basically got their home back.

316
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,180
This is the real thing.

317
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,550
Tortoise is walking around

318
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,280
[inaudible] crazy man.

319
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,130
So they did it. They got all
the goats, not all the goats.

320
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,050
What do you mean there's Judas Scouts?

321
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,690
They kept them around. Why? I would just,

322
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:48,280
I would have shot them first
just out of sympathy for them.

323
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:52,210
Yeah, exactly. Well, they
needed the goats because, well,

324
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:56,830
there was the problem of people

325
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:04,300
[inaudible]

326
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,240
because during the 90s these
demonstrations started.

327
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:08,243
That happened.

328
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,830
Demonstrations, outrage, violent activity,

329
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,940
constant conflict. To explain

330
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:25,800
[inaudible] [inaudible]. This is
Augustine Lopez, longtime fisherman,

331
00:21:25,801 --> 00:21:27,600
and he told me that in
the 70s and eighties

332
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,830
[inaudible] lobster was fished all
year round [inaudible] no restrictions.

333
00:21:34,831 --> 00:21:38,730
And then fishermen started making a
killing fishing sea cucumber because there

334
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:42,090
was this huge demand. But then
the national park comes in,

335
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,420
same group that's doing the
goat eradication and they
tell the fishermen they're

336
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,880
overfishing, the sea cucumber.
They've got to limit their catch.

337
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:51,780
And the fishermen are like, who are you
to tell me that I can't feed my family?

338
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,783
So they lash out.

339
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,320
They marched down in
Charles Darwin Avenue.

340
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,760
They would come down the street throwing
rocks and sticks and everything.

341
00:22:02,761 --> 00:22:06,360
And that's Paul Watson, founder of
the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society.

342
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,100
He was there counter protesting,

343
00:22:08,101 --> 00:22:11,340
and he says that at one point they went
after national park buildings and they

344
00:22:11,341 --> 00:22:15,450
were attacking the ranger stations with
Molotov cocktails. They blockaded roads.

345
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,050
They literally drove the Rangers out of
the National Park headquarters and took

346
00:22:19,051 --> 00:22:22,860
it over on Isabella. They burned down
a building. They kidnapped some people,

347
00:22:22,861 --> 00:22:26,970
including some of my crew. And they
even killed dozens of tortillas.

348
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:31,440
It says sledding their throats
according to some accounts.

349
00:22:31,441 --> 00:22:35,600
They even hung them from trees. Uh,

350
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:39,220
so not only that, but according
to Linda, those goats,

351
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,490
couple islands where they've been
eliminated, fishermen have put them back.

352
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,490
Really? Oh yeah.

353
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,240
And so what they decided to do is leave
the Judas goats on various islands where

354
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:56,800
they can live out their sterilized
days, chomping on grass,

355
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,090
sharing war stories until such time

356
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:04,700
as they might be needed again.

357
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,590
[inaudible] this is the war between the
Greens and the and the fisherman and

358
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:20,120
such. Is that still hot and difficult
and are they still, you know,

359
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:24,860
killing tortoises and they're
not the fisherman? Um,

360
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,770
they seem to have stopped, you know,

361
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:31,940
taking over national park and
killing tortoise's. You know, why it,

362
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,210
it's a combination of
reasons. On the one hand,

363
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:40,280
fishermen have started to participate
in the actual fisheries management more

364
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,520
because it seems like they realize if
they're going to keep their livelihood,

365
00:23:43,521 --> 00:23:46,070
they can't just fish everything
out. But then at the same

366
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,720
time, the tourism economy has been taking
off, and so all of these fishermen,

367
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,950
they find that it's easier for them to
actually survive by using their boats,

368
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,350
um, to take tourists
around island to island.

369
00:23:57,351 --> 00:24:00,070
So they're all kind of converting
over into the tourism economy. Huh.

370
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,870
We're going to take a short
break. This is Radiolab.

371
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:07,090
We'll be back with producer Tim Howard
and this hour on Galapagos in just a

372
00:24:07,091 --> 00:24:07,360
moment.
