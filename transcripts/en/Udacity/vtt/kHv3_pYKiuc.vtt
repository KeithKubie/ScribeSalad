00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.340
Let's put that brand new understanding of the horizontal line test into action.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.876
Here are 3 functions, we have f of x equals 2x to the 5th, g of x equals 3

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:16.632
times the opposite value of x minus 2, and h of x equals 2x squared. Please

00:00:16.632 --> 00:00:21.391
tell me whether each of them has an inverse. Remember the horizontal line test

00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:25.880
says that a function will have an inverse. If any horizontal line we can draw

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.989
on the coordinate plane will only pass through the original function one time.
