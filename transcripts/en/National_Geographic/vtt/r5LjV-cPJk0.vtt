MARINA ELLIOT:<i> Homo Naledi's
story is changing our story,</i>

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:05.404
<i>the story of human origins.</i>

00:00:05.404 --> 00:00:07.673
<i> And, in fact, this
 discovery is changing</i>

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:10.777
<i> how paleoanthropologists
 and scientists</i>

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:13.546
<i> think about and craft
 the story of our past.</i>

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:16.081 line:0%
( audience applause )

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:20.186 line:0%
All of you have actually seen
this image before, I'm hoping,

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:23.123
<i> and it tells a story; it
tells a really good story;</i>

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:26.125
<i> and it's a story about
two cavers and some bones,</i>

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:29.328
<i> but it's also about
 how that discovery led</i>

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:33.432
<i> a paleoanthropologist to
place a very unusual call</i>

00:00:33.432 --> 00:00:35.801
<i> for excavators of
 a particular type.</i>

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:37.737
( audience chuckling )

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:41.507
<i>And how this call brought six
women, myself one of them,</i>

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:43.976 line:0%
<i> together with a huge
 team of scientists,</i>

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:46.946 line:0%
<i> volunteers, and
 cavers, to undertake</i>

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:50.183 line:0%
<i>an extraordinary three-week
expedition in South Africa.</i>

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:52.618
<i> Now, the pictures and
perhaps the video give you</i>

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:54.387
<i>a little idea of what it's like.</i>

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:57.657
<i>But as one of those people
that had to traverse that route</i>

00:00:57.657 --> 00:01:00.993
<i>every day, I'll give you a
slightly more personal idea</i>

00:01:00.993 --> 00:01:02.695
<i> of what that was like.</i>

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:04.330
So that is some of the damage.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.666
I am not the hairy ankle,
thank you very much.

00:01:06.666 --> 00:01:08.868
( audience laughing )

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:10.769
But the top three
pictures are of me

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:13.038
<i> at various stages
 during the expedition.</i>

00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:14.774
<i>But it really was all worth it.</i>

00:01:14.774 --> 00:01:18.511
You saw the fantastic
results of our expedition.

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:21.247
<i> Just an incredible
treasure trove of material</i>

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.549
<i> that we couldn't
 possibly have imagined,</i>

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.452
<i>with images that really still
send shivers down my back</i>

00:01:26.452 --> 00:01:28.154
<i> when I see them.</i>

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:30.556
I was the first scientist
into the chamber

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:32.825
once the remains
had been discovered.

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:36.396
And it really was one of
those watershed moments.

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:38.898
There's a little narrow
hallway that then opens up

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:41.067
into the Dinaledi
chamber itself.

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:43.369
And as I squeezed
through that hallway

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.139
and looked into the
Dinaledi chamber,

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:49.508
for me, what flashed through
my head that very instant

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:51.410
was Howard Carter

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.946
<i> and what it must have
 felt like for him</i>

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:57.216
<i>to step into Tutankhamun's
 tomb for the first time.</i>

00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:59.685
Both of us only had a lamp

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:02.388
to illuminate what
was in that space.

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:06.259
And I think, for me,
I really felt like

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.629
all I could see was what
my headlamp showed me,

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.631
and that was flashes of
bone everywhere I looked.

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:14.467
And I really thought: "Wow,

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.235
"this is what Carter
must have felt like

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:19.304
"when he saw flashes of
treasure everywhere he looked."

00:02:19.304 --> 00:02:21.507
It's an exhilarating feeling.

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:24.543 line:0%
<i>And by now you know that these
remains actually represent</i>

00:02:24.543 --> 00:02:27.480 line:0%
<i> one of the most unusual
and incredible assemblages</i>

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.582 line:0%
<i> of material in history,</i>

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:32.685 line:0%
<i> and an entirely new
 species: Homo Naledi.</i>

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:35.621
<i> When Homo Naledi was
announced last September,</i>

00:02:35.621 --> 00:02:37.757
<i> it trended number two
 on the Twitterverse,</i>

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:39.826
briefly usurping
the Kardashians,

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:43.296
which I understand
is quite a feat.

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:45.664
<i> But one of the reasons
 it made such a splash</i>

00:02:45.664 --> 00:02:47.533
<i>was the volume of the material.</i>

00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:50.503
<i>I mean these 1500, and now 1700,</i>

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:53.606
<i> specimens that we'd
recovered was unprecedented.</i>

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:56.108
And what people maybe
also don't realize

00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:58.945
is that all that material,
those 1500 fragments

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:01.647
that we recovered during
that initial expedition,

00:03:01.647 --> 00:03:04.851
<i> came out of an area 80
centimeters by 80 centimeters</i>

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:06.752
<i> by 20 centimeters deep.</i>

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:08.955
<i> That's the size of
 a child's sandbox.</i>

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:13.026
And for a discipline as
used to making a fuss

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.862
about one tooth
or finding a jaw,

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.997
that really was
quite traumatizing

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:21.533
to the paleoanthropological
community.

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:24.704
You see, for decades
we'd believed the story

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:27.807
that the human fossils were
as rare as hens' teeth,

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:31.644
<i>that it took basically an act
of God or a lottery ticket</i>

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:35.147
<i>or being hit by lightning in
order to find this material.</i>

00:03:35.147 --> 00:03:38.050
But here was a situation where
not only was the material

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.720 line:0%
ridiculously abundant
but it'd been found

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.988 line:0%
<i> by someone who'd been
electrocuted once before.</i>

00:03:42.988 --> 00:03:44.123
( audience laughing )

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:47.426
So, what was going on here?

00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:48.994
But what a lot of people forget

00:03:48.994 --> 00:03:50.997
about getting hit
by lightning twice

00:03:50.997 --> 00:03:53.332
is that you can increase
your odds tremendously

00:03:53.332 --> 00:03:56.235
by getting out there every
day with a lightning rod.

00:03:56.235 --> 00:04:00.272
And what Lee proved in
finding Sediba and then Naledi

00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:03.676
is that experience,
persistence, and knowledge

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:05.845
really can pay off big time.

00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:08.681
But if you don't look,
you certainly won't find.

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.150
<i> Then we actually started
 looking at the bones.</i>

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.953
<i>And within those 1500 fragments
 that we were looking at,</i>

00:04:14.953 --> 00:04:18.524
<i>we had the skulls and the bodies
of at least 15 individuals;</i>

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:20.159
and we had almost
every bone in the body

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:22.327
represented more than once.

00:04:22.327 --> 00:04:24.997
And what we found was
totally unexpected;

00:04:24.997 --> 00:04:28.267
a combination of features
that we couldn't possibly

00:04:28.267 --> 00:04:30.703
have imagined and couldn't
have predicted in advance.

00:04:30.703 --> 00:04:32.772
What this meant, though,
was that our understanding

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:36.976
of skeletal shape and
species identification

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:39.045
kind of had to be rethought;

00:04:39.045 --> 00:04:42.214
because if we took just
a scrap of Naledi's jaw,

00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:43.783
we would say it was one thing,

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:46.051
but if we took a
scrap of its foot,

00:04:46.051 --> 00:04:48.120
we would say it's something
totally different.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.724
And then there were parts of
Naledi that were unique to it.

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:54.059
So it was really one of
those situations where we had

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:56.628
to start thinking about
those stories again

00:04:56.628 --> 00:04:58.497
and trying to figure
out what these features

00:04:58.497 --> 00:05:00.899
actually were telling us.

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:03.969
It presented a problem for
paleoanthropology, though,

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:06.105
because it meant that
scraps really aren't

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:08.541
a good indication of
the whole anymore.

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:12.178
And it raises questions about
all those other little scraps

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:14.413
that we've been
making stories about

00:05:14.413 --> 00:05:16.482
so definitively for so long.

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:19.418
So it really is
challenging us to go back

00:05:19.418 --> 00:05:22.422
and look at the material
we have with new eyes

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:24.089
and maybe think
about how we need

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:26.425
to reconfigure those stories.

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:29.529
In addition, Naledi's
mosaic of features

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:31.496
raises questions
about how we view

00:05:31.496 --> 00:05:33.666
our origins in the first place.

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:36.435
Now, we don't have a
clear date for Naledi yet.

00:05:36.435 --> 00:05:39.439
<i> But if Naledi is old
 or if it's young,</i>

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:43.308
<i>either way, it suggests that
we don't really understand</i>

00:05:43.308 --> 00:05:46.646
<i> that human family
 tree very well at all,</i>

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:50.583
and that it reinforces
the fact that we just need

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:54.153
to maybe think about that
story again in a different way.

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:55.921
<i> Not only is the tree
 much bushier, maybe,</i>

00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:58.191
<i> than we originally
 thought about it,</i>

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:01.894
<i>but our family tree may not
actually be a bush at all.</i>

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:04.830
<i>What we may be looking at
is more like a river delta;</i>

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.134
<i>a whole bunch of rivulets coming
down from a common source;</i>

00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:10.269
<i> some that trickle
 down and dry out</i>

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:12.070
<i>and we never see them again;</i>

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.874
<i> other rivulets come back
 and join another rivulet</i>

00:06:15.874 --> 00:06:18.878
<i> to make a bigger rivulet
 that continues on down;</i>

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:22.482
<i>and all of them ending up
in a big pool at the bottom;</i>

00:06:22.482 --> 00:06:25.851
<i>and that big pool is the now
over seven billion humans</i>

00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:28.420
<i> that we see on
 the planet today.</i>

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.023
And this analogy may
stand the test of time,

00:06:31.023 --> 00:06:32.858
or not, we'll have to see.

00:06:32.858 --> 00:06:35.327
And as it turned out,
the next chapter,

00:06:35.327 --> 00:06:37.996
doing the analysis and
description of the material,

00:06:37.996 --> 00:06:39.599
also needed a bit of a rewrite.

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:41.567
<i> Lee and the team
 decided to open up</i>

00:06:41.567 --> 00:06:44.904
<i>the primary analysis of the
fossils to young scientists,</i>

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:48.374
<i> early-career scientists,
 and not just a few;</i>

00:06:48.374 --> 00:06:51.644
<i> almost 40 researchers
 met in South Africa</i>

00:06:51.644 --> 00:06:53.746
<i> to do the analysis
 of the material.</i>

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:57.316
<i>And, even in estimating for
a modest 40-hour workweek,</i>

00:06:57.316 --> 00:06:59.118
<i>which we certainly exceeded,</i>

00:06:59.118 --> 00:07:02.554
this amounted to almost
10,000 hours of research;

00:07:02.554 --> 00:07:04.823
something that would
take a single researcher

00:07:04.823 --> 00:07:06.859
almost five years to match.

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:08.761
But it did rattle
a few cages because

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:10.729
it presented a new
model for research;

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:12.331
one that was more inclusive;

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:16.835
one that allowed engagement and
discussion among each other.

00:07:16.835 --> 00:07:18.337
And it was really exciting,

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:20.906
and something, in fact,
that I think our discipline

00:07:20.906 --> 00:07:24.310
has been very sadly
neglectful of in the past.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.345
And that actually brings
us to the last way

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:29.748
in which Naledi may be
changing our human story;

00:07:29.748 --> 00:07:32.051
and that is in how we tell it;

00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:34.386
how anthropologists
and scientists

00:07:34.386 --> 00:07:37.757
share that information with each
other and with the public.

00:07:37.757 --> 00:07:40.392
<i> The scientific papers
 that describe Naledi</i>

00:07:40.392 --> 00:07:43.696
<i>were released in a open-access
 journal called eLife.</i>

00:07:43.696 --> 00:07:46.866
<i> Shortly thereafter, we
released all the shape files</i>

00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:49.702
<i> for the fossils on a
website called MorphoSource,</i>

00:07:49.702 --> 00:07:51.370
<i>hosted by Duke University.</i>

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:54.206
This meant that the primary
information on Naledi

00:07:54.206 --> 00:07:57.476
and basically casts
of all the fossils

00:07:57.476 --> 00:08:01.580
were available to anyone who
wanted them, free of charge.

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.984
Our team really felt strongly
that because this material

00:08:04.984 --> 00:08:08.353
is not ours to hoard, it's
South African heritage,

00:08:08.353 --> 00:08:10.256
it's actually world heritage.

00:08:10.256 --> 00:08:13.993
This material relates to
the origins of all of us;

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:15.894
and it was really
important for us

00:08:15.894 --> 00:08:18.230
to share that with all of us.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.998
It's a human question.

00:08:19.998 --> 00:08:21.967
<i> For me, the open-access
 model is actually</i>

00:08:21.967 --> 00:08:24.302
<i> one of the best
 parts of this story.</i>

00:08:24.302 --> 00:08:27.806
<i> In the last year,
 well, since September,</i>

00:08:27.806 --> 00:08:30.208
<i>I have done over 400 interviews</i>

00:08:30.208 --> 00:08:32.844
<i>and almost 60 talks on Naledi;</i>

00:08:32.844 --> 00:08:36.315
<i>and everywhere I've gone, the
response has been the same:</i>

00:08:36.315 --> 00:08:39.918
<i>excitement, interest, and
 a real desire to learn</i>

00:08:39.918 --> 00:08:43.555
<i> about human origins and
 scientific exploration.</i>

00:08:43.555 --> 00:08:47.058
But I think one of the things
that I have seen in that

00:08:47.058 --> 00:08:50.462
is that people maybe
kind of feel isolated

00:08:50.462 --> 00:08:52.164
by scientific research;

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:56.001
not because they are stupid
or the science is too hard,

00:08:56.001 --> 00:08:58.336
but because perhaps
we as scientists

00:08:58.336 --> 00:09:00.772
have done a poor job
of telling the stories.

00:09:00.772 --> 00:09:04.276
People cannot be expected to
know what they haven't learned;

00:09:04.276 --> 00:09:07.312
and if they feel isolated
from that learning,

00:09:07.312 --> 00:09:11.984
it develops into mistrust;
and mistrust breeds fear;

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:14.620
and fear blocks curiosity.

00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:17.456
It's really up to us as
scientists and educators

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:19.558
to make our research
comprehensible

00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:21.226
and accessible to people

00:09:21.226 --> 00:09:22.928
and help them engage
with what we do

00:09:22.928 --> 00:09:24.563
in a really meaningful way.

00:09:24.563 --> 00:09:27.133
<i> Science really is all
about adjusting one's views</i>

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:28.534
<i>in light of new evidence.</i>

00:09:28.534 --> 00:09:31.269
<i> And, in many ways, by
 pushing the dark spaces</i>

00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:34.072
<i> of South Africa, Homo
 Naledi's discovery</i>

00:09:34.072 --> 00:09:36.875
is pulling paleoanthropology
into the light

00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:40.178
of new ways of doing and
thinking about our science.

00:09:40.178 --> 00:09:42.949
And as much as I love the
underworld that I work in,

00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:46.085
I think this research is
really putting a necessary

00:09:46.085 --> 00:09:49.622
and very positive
spotlight on human origins

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:52.491
and giving paleoanthropologists
an opportunity

00:09:52.491 --> 00:09:54.760
to tell some very
cool new stories.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.562
I hope that you will
help me share those

00:09:56.562 --> 00:09:57.763
with the rest of the world.

00:09:57.763 --> 00:09:58.464
Thank you.
