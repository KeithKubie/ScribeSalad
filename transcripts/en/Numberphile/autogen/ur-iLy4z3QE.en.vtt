the question was not quite this son but

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980
the question was not quite this son but
 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.990
the question was not quite this son but
but essentially this son 1 plus a 1 over

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000
but essentially this son 1 plus a 1 over
 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.529
but essentially this son 1 plus a 1 over
2 squared 1 over 3 squared and so on ok

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539
2 squared 1 over 3 squared and so on ok
 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.840

and so to get this enclosed form this

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850
and so to get this enclosed form this
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.250
and so to get this enclosed form this
was the problem to get it in closed form

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
was the problem to get it in closed form
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.510
was the problem to get it in closed form
and this was famously solved by Euler in

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520
and this was famously solved by Euler in
 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.250
and this was famously solved by Euler in
1735 and he showed that this was equal

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260
1735 and he showed that this was equal
 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.210
1735 and he showed that this was equal
to PI squared over 6 now of course Euler

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220
to PI squared over 6 now of course Euler
 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.190
to PI squared over 6 now of course Euler
being Euler you know wasn't going to

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200

wanted to do this far more generally so

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090
wanted to do this far more generally so
 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.550
wanted to do this far more generally so
he looked at the general form of these

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560

values this takes him in me in the
 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.810

positive integers and this is what we

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820
positive integers and this is what we
 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.910

were was interested in and he was able

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
were was interested in and he was able
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.280
were was interested in and he was able
to show of course that when you take

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290
to show of course that when you take
 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.499
to show of course that when you take
even integers so you look at this guy

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
even integers so you look at this guy
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.469
even integers so you look at this guy
even values that this took the form of

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479
even values that this took the form of
 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.359
even values that this took the form of
something rational times pi to the 2m so

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369
something rational times pi to the 2m so
 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.069
something rational times pi to the 2m so
of course pi vain transcendental this

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079
of course pi vain transcendental this
 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.050
of course pi vain transcendental this

eleven but one of these is irrational we
don't know which one so it's so little

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590
don't know which one so it's so little
 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.610
don't know which one so it's so little
known about it and it's sort of I think

and positive integers and the reason I

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820
and positive integers and the reason I
 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.339
and positive integers and the reason I
did that was cuz I wanted to estimate

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:52.349
did that was cuz I wanted to estimate

anyway I did go through someone I went

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680
anyway I did go through someone I went
 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.159
anyway I did go through someone I went
through quite a few I have a list here

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:13.169
through quite a few I have a list here
 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:15.350
through quite a few I have a list here
what I did was I went through those

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360
what I did was I went through those
 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.290
what I did was I went through those
numbers and I checked whether the

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300
numbers and I checked whether the
 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.659
numbers and I checked whether the
combinations were co-prime so in other

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669
combinations were co-prime so in other
 

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.520
combinations were co-prime so in other
words I asked what was their greatest

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530
words I asked what was their greatest
 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.399
words I asked what was their greatest
common divisor of the three numbers and

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409
common divisor of the three numbers and
 

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:27.670
common divisor of the three numbers and
if that greatest common divisor was want

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680
if that greatest common divisor was want
 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.860
if that greatest common divisor was want
then there co-prime if it was something

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:30.870
then there co-prime if it was something
 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:31.939
then there co-prime if it was something
of a higher than one then they're not

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949
of a higher than one then they're not
 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:33.140
of a higher than one then they're not
going quite so I just went through and I

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150
going quite so I just went through and I
 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.309
going quite so I just went through and I
checked them all all the different

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319
checked them all all the different
 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:36.740
checked them all all the different
combinations so let me do I've gotta

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750
combinations so let me do I've gotta
 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.750
combinations so let me do I've gotta
count this now really I haven't haven't

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:39.760
count this now really I haven't haven't
 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.010
count this now really I haven't haven't
check this I didn't check that and all

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020
check this I didn't check that and all
 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.390
check this I didn't check that and all
that the estimate came out right so this

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400
that the estimate came out right so this
 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.580
that the estimate came out right so this
is real times the election stuff so

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:44.590
is real times the election stuff so
 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.520
is real times the election stuff so
anyway the number that occurred prime

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530
anyway the number that occurred prime
 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.170
anyway the number that occurred prime
let's just let's just count them okay so

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180
let's just let's just count them okay so
 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.660
let's just let's just count them okay so
here's my list so that's one all the

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:51.670
here's my list so that's one all the
 

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.640
here's my list so that's one all the
ticks are co-prime okay these normal

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650
