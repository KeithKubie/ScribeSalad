00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.860
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.160
Would you please welcome to the stage Chris
Yerga.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.870
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Chris Yerga: Thank you very much.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.209
There's actually three of us on stage.

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:18.650
So I'm joined here with my partners in crime
here, Ellie Powers, who's the lead program

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.550
manager for the Google Play -- we'll get into
that later, and Miles Barr, who runs the engineering

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.550
team.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.840
So I want to talk to you today about Android
Apps in Google Play.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.000
So I'm the engineering director for the Google
Play team.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.790
And it's my job to make sure that every year,
there's more and more opportunities for you

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.190
as developers to build a successful business
selling your apps in the Play store.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.589
Now, I want to start by saying thank you.

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.089
Thank you for building incredible apps and
games in the Play Store.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:00.579
Thank you for helping the Google Play store
and the Android platform become the fastest

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.080
growing mobile platform around, and thank
you for delighting hundreds of millions of

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.650
users with your products.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.660
Mobile apps have gotten to this point where
they've become intertwined in our lives in

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.330
a very meaningful way.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.100
And I had actually, you know, written this
intro the other day, and then just a few hours

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.660
ago, I had an experience that really underlined
it for me.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.160
I was up on stage.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.120
I had the privilege to be part of the keynote
this morning.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.820
And so I talked a bit about Google Play and
all the great stuff that we are launching

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:34.820
today.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.810
And then I had a moment when I had to step
offstage when Hugo got to announce the Nexus

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.960
7 tablet.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.430
So I was sitting on my chair on the side of
the stage and listening to Hugo, and candidly,

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.740
we'd rehearsed that presentation numerous
times before, so the content was a little

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.740
old to me.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.810
And all of a sudden I discovered, this wasn't
even a conscious thing, I had my phone in

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:57.990
my hand.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.280
And what I was doing was I was playing a game
that I had just downloaded.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.690
So I had recently gone to Japan and got this
insane game, I don't know if anyone is familiar

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.750
with it, called Mushroom Garden, where the
game is, you grow mushrooms, it's exactly

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.750
what it says on the tin.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.620
There's really nothing more to it.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.200
But it's really oddly compelling.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.590
Because you have to check back to see if you're
getting these rare mushrooms.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.260
I was playing this game and I thought, this
is not a rational thing to be doing.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.530
Like, I'm in the middle of this keynote presentation.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.530
There are 6,000 people in the room.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.650
And I'm playing this game.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.310
But what it reminded me of is the fact that
I think, you know, the best kind of entertainment

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.810
or the best kinds of products permeate your
life in that way, where they just become a

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.069
part of your behavior, and it's almost like
second thought.

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.440
And these applications, they're not just getting
installed into our devices; they're becoming

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.900
a part of our lives and our daily existence.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:58.280
And that, combined with the astounding growth
of Android and the crazy numbers of Android

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.819
activations, presents a huge opportunity for
you as developers.

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.630
So today we're going to talk about what it
takes to grow your business.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.230
And in order to have a successful business,
there's really, you know, three things that

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.230
you need.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.490
First is, obviously, you need customers.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.180
You need people who are coming to your products.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.180
And then you need revenue.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.849
You need some means of monetizing those customers
and turning that into revenue for your business.

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:32.880
And the final thing that you need is data
and insight into how your business is operating

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.340
so that you can optimize your business and
the way that you're conducting things to sort

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.130
of create this virtuous cycle that will then
folds back to the beginning to help you get

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.610
more customers and more revenue.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:49.700
We're going to be deep-diving into each one
of these areas a bit today.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.130
And let's start off talking about customers.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:01.459
So in the Google Play team, we really -- we
think about customers on sort of two axes.

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:06.730
So the first one is that, obviously, we want
to be bringing in an ever-increasing number

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.770
of customers into the front door of the Google
Play store.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.170
But on the other axis, we also want to be
driving ever-increasing engagement with these

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.170
customers.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.170
So what do I mean by that?

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.930
So engagement means giving customers more
reasons to come to this store, more reasons

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.880
to keep coming back, giving them a delightful
experience when they use the store and make

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.270
a purchase so that they're happy, they become
regular customers and trusting in the Google

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:41.010
Play store and are -- we create sort of a
lifelong relationship with them and value.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:48.150
And if you think about one of the primary
drivers of bringing an ever-increasing number

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.780
of customers to the store certainly has to
be the astounding rate of Android device activations.

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.960
As we talked about the keynote today, a year
ago, we were at 100 million devices.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.990
Now we're at 400 million total devices activated.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.270
I mean, these are just crazy numbers.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.790
A million devices a day are being activated.

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:14.690
That's a device for every person in the City
of San Francisco, where we're here today,

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:15.690
every single day.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.910
It's just crazy numbers.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.550
And each one of these users is basically a
potential customer of your apps and games.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.770
And the other most meaningful thing that we've
done in the last year is the release of the

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.310
Google Play brand.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:39.090
So to consumers, Google Play means all of
your digital content, apps, games, music,

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:46.430
books, movies, and now magazines and TV, available
across your devices and on the Web.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:52.320
And so you might, you know, rightly ask yourself,
well, so what does this mean to me as an application

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.520
developer?

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.550
Well, by bringing all of these content types
together, we did so in a couple ways.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.730
The first is, we put everything under a single
brand, but we also brought all these content

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:07.450
types together in a single store.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.930
And so the more content types that we launch,
the more reasons people have to come to the

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:14.479
store, the more reasons they have to come
back.

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:20.940
And one of the things that we've noticed is
that with each new content type that we launch,

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.790
there's additional people who come to the
store and maybe even make their purchase,

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.680
their first purchase, from one of these content
types.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.250
So, you know, certainly many people make their
first purchase as an app or game.

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:37.169
But, you know, when we launched music or launched
books, these people come in, they get over

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:40.400
that hump of making their first purchase and
every time they come in the front door of

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.830
our store, we're merchandising the full swath
of everything we have, including apps and

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.460
games, to them, you're getting an opportunity
to put your products in front of these users.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:57.389
And the more different types of content that
our users are purchasing, the more engaged

00:06:57.389 --> 00:07:00.390
a customer of ours they become.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:03.850
And so they have more and more reasons to
frequently come back to the store.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:09.729
And we create a deeper relationship with them.

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:14.889
Now, the other thing that's important about
Google Play is that it's a Google-wide brand.

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:19.740
So by bringing all this stuff together, we
have the opportunity to bring the full weight

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:25.509
of Google's resources behind the store in
a couple different areas.

00:07:25.509 --> 00:07:30.090
Promotions, marketing, driving customer awareness,
et cetera.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:35.889
One simple but pretty concrete example of
this is the fact that we're now present in

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:41.460
the universal navigation bar up here that's
at the top of all of Google's Web properties.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:48.449
And so this not only gives users sort of a
quick one-click access to the Google Play

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:54.699
store, but what we've also seen is that for
many users, this is driving the first time

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:56.900
they've ever visited the Web Store.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:02.389
So, you know, we have a lot of people who
use the Device Store on a fairly regular basis.

00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:06.180
But this is driving awareness and giving them
yet another opportunity to come to the store,

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:10.710
maybe when they're engaged with their desktop
computer or laptop rather than their mobile

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:11.930
device.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:17.319
The other thing that's important here is that
by bringing all this content together into

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:24.240
sort of a single umbrella brand, it enables
us to much more effectively do marketing and

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.240
promotion.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.150
So when we launched the Google Play brand,
we did this promotion across all the content

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.050
types, with deeply discounted content, 25-cent
apps.

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:39.480
It was very successful in not only driving
increased app sales of the things that were

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:44.510
on sale as well as, actually, things that
weren't part of the promotion, but also driving

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:48.820
a higher rate of people making their first
purchase from the Google Play store.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:54.120
And more recently, we've tried to do some,
you know, more creative things.

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:59.190
Last week, we did this Play with Collectibles
promotion, where we had a variety of in-game

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:04.800
items that were available in the Play Store
for a limited time basis across a variety

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.709
of different games.

00:09:06.709 --> 00:09:12.890
And I think this is -- we're starting to see
the first sort of creative different ways

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:17.110
that we're trying to experiment with marketing
and promotions here.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:20.930
You know, I can't really say too much about
our future plans.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:26.250
But what I'll tell you is this: Google Play
is hugely important for Google.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:27.990
It's a very strategic thing for us.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.060
We want to -- I mean, we have a great brand.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.890
We have amazing apps and games that you all
have built.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:37.580
I mean, if you think back to, you know, when
I actually joined the team, just under two

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:42.750
years ago, like, the progress that we've made
in terms of quality of apps and games is just

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:43.750
astounding.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.140
So we have something that's really special
and really strategically important to us.

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.820
So we're going to shout it from the rooftops.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:52.040
We're going to make a big splash about Google
Play.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.580
Your grandparents are going to know about
it.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:55.621
Your friends on other platforms are going
to know about it.

00:09:55.621 --> 00:09:59.890
And so we're going to continue to do a lot
more in terms of marketing and promotion to

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:05.230
bring more people into the store.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.290
So is that working?

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.490
Well, we announced some pretty great numbers
today.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:14.030
20 billion total app downloads in the store.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:18.740
1.5 billion apps being downloaded per month
out of 600,000 apps.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:25.730
So, basically, on any metric that we can measure,
the store is continuing to grow at a very

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:27.519
fast pace.

00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:34.870
And the users who are driving that growth
are increasingly global in nature.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:40.750
So Google Play apps and games are available
in 190 countries and territories.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:45.860
132 of those support paid applications.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:51.480
We continue to make investments there, trying
to close that gap and offer paid apps in new

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.480
places where we can.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:59.480
But in terms of the global footprint of Android
users, we have 92% coverage.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.420
So 92% of those folks have access to paid
apps.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:09.370
And so I think, you know, one of the first
takeaways for you all is just really thinking

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:14.029
about the global opportunity for Android Apps.

00:11:14.029 --> 00:11:18.170
In the Google Play store, you want to really
make sure that you're thinking about how to

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:23.470
reach customers in a variety of different
geographies, a variety of different languages,

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:30.279
to really take advantage of the full market
opportunity here.

00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:37.950
Now, we talked about an amazing number of
device activations.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.990
But not all devices are alike.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:47.840
And with the Nexus 7 tablet, what we aspired
to do was to produce a tablet that -- or an

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:53.000
Android device maybe in the more generic sense,
that really sets the goalposts for what a

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.959
device that contemplates Google Play at its
core could be.

00:11:56.959 --> 00:12:00.820
From the moment you turn on the tablet -- and
I think everyone here is going to be turning

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.779
on a tablet pretty darned soon here; right?

00:12:02.779 --> 00:12:05.570
So that's pretty awesome.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:10.640
I had nothing to do with it, but feel free
to applaud.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.340
The -- as soon as you turn it on, you're immediately,
as soon as you come out of the setup wizard,

00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:19.250
the very first thing you see is your content
library.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:24.230
And the other thing that we're doing here
that's pretty novel is, when you activate

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:32.240
the device and create a Wallet account, you're
given $25 in-store credit for the Google Play

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:36.730
store so that you can immediately go in and
start buying things from the store.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:42.720
And the intention here is to capture people
at that magic moment.

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.720
So you know how it is; right?

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.720
You get a new device.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.110
You're all amped about it, like, "Oh, this
thing is really cool."

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:49.730
You want to install the latest game on it
to show off your hardware.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:54.030
You want to trick it out with live wallpaper
and widgets and all that stuff.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:59.190
So we want to get people right at that magic
moment, give them a direct on ramp to the

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:03.920
store, give them money to spend to create
those sort of habits so that they become a

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.060
lifelong user.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:12.880
I think the other thing that's important here
is that we also preprovision content on this

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.880
device.

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:18.370
So when you turn on your device and activate
it, you know, you get a movie to watch.

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:22.440
You get some magazines and a book to read
and things like that, so that you can really

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:27.880
understand what that experience is like, so
that you're -- you know, you understand the

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.410
value, you're more willing to make a purchase
when you get into the store.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:38.940
So a variety of ways that we're bringing customers
to the store and trying to deepen our engagement

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:43.620
with them to keep them coming back and giving
them more reason to come.

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:49.130
The next bit of this, obviously, is revenue,
so monetizing these customers.

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:55.970
And so in terms of revenue, we think of this
in sort of two categories.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.000
So first is thinking about it from the user
point of view.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.250
We want to give users flexible ways to pay.

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:07.360
And then for you as developers, we want to
give you flexible ways to monetize your applications.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.660
From the user point of view, a few things
we've done.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:14.829
So credit and debit cards clearly continue
to be a very popular way for people to buy

00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:16.610
apps.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:21.970
With the new setup wizard that we've done
in Jelly Bean, we've also made it easy for

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:26.750
users to create a Wallet account and set up
a credit or debit card at that moment when

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:30.820
you're setting up the device and you're in
that mode of, okay, I've got to configure

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.560
everything and get everything set up.

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:38.360
So it reduces friction for people purchasing
things in the store afterwards.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.420
Obviously, credit cards aren't popular everywhere
in the world.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:47.890
So in order to address some other markets,
we've also been aggressively working on carrier

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.700
billing as a means to give people a way to
pay.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:55.360
And then, as I mentioned, the Google Play
Balance is yet another thing that we're rolling

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.860
out.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:02.570
For you as developers, certainly, you know,
a variety of ways to monetize your apps and

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:07.940
ways that are increasing, you know, ad-funded
and paid apps continue to be very popular

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:11.529
and viable ways to monetize your apps.

00:15:11.529 --> 00:15:14.529
In-app billing, been a huge success for us.

00:15:14.529 --> 00:15:17.490
We'll be talking about that in some greater
detail.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:21.880
But subscriptions is kind of like -- the way
I think of subscriptions is sort of like the

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.350
next wave of in-app billing.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:30.399
It's an opportunity to create a recurring
revenue relationship with your customers.

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:32.740
Business models.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:36.160
So you're going to hear this, I'm going to
say this time and time again.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.910
We're going to talk about international.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:41.680
International markets really is where a lot
of the growth is happening, and international

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.880
markets are key to revenue growth.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:48.560
So fully two-thirds of Google Play revenue
is coming from outside the U.S.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:56.990
And, now, the United States remains the largest
single country where Android devices are being

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:58.930
activated on a daily basis.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:03.870
However, in aggregate, there's more devices
being activated outside the U.S. on a daily

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:05.589
basis than inside.

00:16:05.589 --> 00:16:07.329
And you can look here.

00:16:07.329 --> 00:16:11.160
We've listed some of the top markets for paid
apps.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:16.410
And even when you just limit this to the top
five, you're already spanning the Americas,

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:18.579
Europe, and Asia.

00:16:18.579 --> 00:16:24.760
So really want to be thinking about international
for monetizing your apps.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:32.310
And I want to start off here and talk a little
bit about an international success story.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:39.010
So between April of 2011 and April of this
year, revenue in Japan and Korea increased

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:42.589
14X. 14 times.

00:16:42.589 --> 00:16:44.570
That's crazy growth.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:48.570
Now, what happened during that period of time
that accounts for this?

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:54.480
Well, certainly, we activated quite a lot
of Android devices in those regions during

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.480
that time.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.080
So that's responsible for some of it.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.320
And certainly there was a lot of, you know,
really compelling apps that were built and

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.320
released.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:10.439
But what really made this happen is this almost
magic combination of direct carrier billing

00:17:10.439 --> 00:17:11.439
and in-app billing.

00:17:11.439 --> 00:17:14.829
So we're going to talk a little bit about
how that works.

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:22.509
So in Japan and Korea, you know, credit cards
aren't necessarily, you know, the predominant

00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:24.169
way that people are used to buying things.

00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:30.229
And, you know, actually, I should go further
than that and say that people actually expect

00:17:30.229 --> 00:17:33.580
to be able to purchase things using their
phone in these regions.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:41.000
And so we've really aggressively gone after
carrier billing deployments to enable that.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.940
And we've gotten to a point now where I'm
very happy to say that in Korea and Japan,

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:52.629
full 90% of users are on a mobile network
that offers carrier billing with Google Play.

00:17:52.629 --> 00:17:57.120
Now, this isn't, you know, a phenomenon that's
limited to Asia.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:01.769
Actually, everywhere that we've deployed carrier
billing, Europe and the United States, et

00:18:01.769 --> 00:18:03.850
cetera, it's been wildly popular.

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.350
It's just such a frictionless way to purchase
things.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:11.090
It's actually the way that I actually purchase
content myself.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:16.519
So worldwide, globally, fully 73% of Google
Play app purchases are made with carrier billing

00:18:16.519 --> 00:18:17.549
when it's available.

00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:23.140
So if it's available to users, they predominantly
choose that as a form of payment.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:28.629
We've made some pretty significant investments
in carrier billing this year, launched with

00:18:28.629 --> 00:18:32.049
a number of new carriers across a number of
countries.

00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:35.289
And you can see the list of countries it's
available here.

00:18:35.289 --> 00:18:38.679
We're going to continue to really aggressively
push this.

00:18:38.679 --> 00:18:44.409
Google Play is the largest Appstore that supports
direct carrier billing.

00:18:44.409 --> 00:18:49.770
And we see it as one of the huge growth prospects
for bringing more revenue to the store.

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:53.320
So carrier billing launching in Japan and
Korea.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:58.879
As part of that success story, every time
we would deploy a new carrier in those regions,

00:18:58.879 --> 00:19:04.860
we would see giant jumps in revenue, so there
was this built-up, pent-up demand there that

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:07.129
we were unlocking with each of these launches.

00:19:07.129 --> 00:19:13.149
But then the other thing that turned out to
be super popular in these regions was freemium

00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:17.009
business model games that leveraged in-app
purchases.

00:19:17.009 --> 00:19:26.289
So in-app purchasing has been a huge breakout
success for Google Play, both for developers,

00:19:26.289 --> 00:19:28.259
and users have really embraced it as well.

00:19:28.259 --> 00:19:33.739
The thing that I really like about in-app
purchasing is, it's one of these things where

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:37.620
it's kind of like a fundamental enabling piece
of infrastructure; right?

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:40.940
So we give you guys this relatively simple
API.

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:45.220
What it allows you to do is to, you know,
make direct charges from within your apps

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:46.450
to users.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:51.580
But you've taken that and used it in some
incredibly creative ways to figure out a wide

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:54.399
variety of different ways to monetize your
apps.

00:19:54.399 --> 00:20:01.109
So, you know, there's the tried and true things,
like, you know, in-app currency or, you know,

00:20:01.109 --> 00:20:07.220
collectibles or items in games, or maybe unlocking,
you know, premium features in an application,

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.220
et cetera.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:14.700
But we've also seen some other really creative
things, like people do time-limited offers.

00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:21.669
I think one developer did this thing where
you download the free game and, like, within

00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:26.440
the first 15 or 30 minutes, like, long enough
that the user understands what the game play

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:30.479
is and probably has a pretty good sense of
what the value of the game is, they offer

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:31.479
them a discount.

00:20:31.479 --> 00:20:34.620
Like, you can unlock the game this one time
for a discounted rate.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:40.009
We've seen a lot of various creative applications
of in-app purchasing.

00:20:40.009 --> 00:20:44.960
One specific case study here is from TinyCo.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.849
They implemented our in-app billing API.

00:20:47.849 --> 00:20:55.470
And they also did something else that's really
important here, which is timely and kind of

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:56.619
frequent content updates; right?

00:20:56.619 --> 00:21:02.259
So you're not only selling things to your
users, but by keeping the content fresh, you

00:21:02.259 --> 00:21:06.049
give your users more reason to keep coming
back to your game and more things to purchase,

00:21:06.049 --> 00:21:09.789
once again, sort of deepening your engagement
with those users.

00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:14.080
They implemented virtual currency in their
app via in-app billing.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.499
And in their own words here from Suli Ali,
the CEO, they said, "Google Play has the highest

00:21:18.499 --> 00:21:21.809
average revenue per paying user of all app
stores.

00:21:21.809 --> 00:21:26.909
This and other Android metrics make us" -- once
again, their words -- "Android zealots," which

00:21:26.909 --> 00:21:29.289
we obviously love to hear.

00:21:29.289 --> 00:21:30.350
So that's in-app billing.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:31.490
That kind of brings us to today.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:38.019
And so, as I say, the next wave of this is
subscriptions.

00:21:38.019 --> 00:21:45.169
So the point I want to get across to you here
is to think broadly about what subscriptions

00:21:45.169 --> 00:21:46.400
can mean for you.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:51.330
It would be kind of easy to fall into a trap
and say, well, subscriptions, that's for,

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:56.210
like, maybe a newspaper or a comic book app
or something where there's some periodic timed

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.869
content that's coming through.

00:21:58.869 --> 00:22:05.059
But you should really think broadly about
what recurring value you can deliver to users

00:22:05.059 --> 00:22:08.859
that they would be willing to pay and engage
in a subscription with you for.

00:22:08.859 --> 00:22:13.429
If you think about it this way: Every in-app
conversion you do, right, that's this opportunity

00:22:13.429 --> 00:22:17.840
you get where the user has said, okay, I'm
really enjoying this experience.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.690
There's some value here I'm willing to pay
for.

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:25.970
If you could convert that instant into a recurring
revenue opportunity with that user, you're

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:31.039
more deeply engaged with that user, you have,
you know, not only a relationship with them,

00:22:31.039 --> 00:22:34.679
but an ongoing revenue stream, that's a very
powerful thing.

00:22:34.679 --> 00:22:40.200
So as an example of maybe some, you know,
broad ways to think about subscriptions, one

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.869
of our launch partners is Glu.

00:22:42.869 --> 00:22:46.519
And they've used subscriptions in an interesting
way.

00:22:46.519 --> 00:22:52.640
They implement this thing you can see up here
that's, like, these VIP gold and silver packages.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:58.899
What that does is it -- it gives you Glu credits
that you can spends in the game and some other

00:22:58.899 --> 00:23:00.320
premium features.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.380
But the interesting thing is that it does
that across a portfolio of their games.

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:11.159
So no matter what game you purchase the subscription
for, you get the benefits of that subscription

00:23:11.159 --> 00:23:13.859
across a suite of their different games.

00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:18.570
And so the cool thing about that is, now you're
kind of building this relationship with a

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:21.859
user where they're kind of invested in your
games; right?

00:23:21.859 --> 00:23:27.100
And so maybe they're going to try other games
or other applications that you have where

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.529
they might not have otherwise done so.

00:23:30.529 --> 00:23:34.989
The CEO of Glu has this to say, that their
subscriptions-based VIP club continues to

00:23:34.989 --> 00:23:39.179
grow in popularity as gamers take advantage
of significant bonus value and the easy sign-up

00:23:39.179 --> 00:23:41.649
process offered on Google Play.

00:23:41.649 --> 00:23:47.859
So think hard about how you can make subscriptions
work for you in creative ways as well.

00:23:47.859 --> 00:23:52.070
So the last portion of this segment is optimization.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:57.539
Optimization is all about getting insight
into your business, understanding, you know,

00:23:57.539 --> 00:24:02.570
metrics and analysis so that you have some
sort of hard data to figure out how to optimize

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:08.960
things, and also optimizing delivery and distribution
of your applications.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.340
So the first thing we've done here is, we've
actually put a considerable amount of work

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.149
into the Google Play developer console.

00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:21.500
We've really -- we've revamped all the statistics
and Analytics and reporting stuff over the

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:22.500
past year.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:27.219
So you can now get installation data for a
variety of metrics, broken down across a number

00:24:27.219 --> 00:24:28.219
of dimensions.

00:24:28.219 --> 00:24:34.429
So, for example, you can look at your user
installs and slice and dice it by geography

00:24:34.429 --> 00:24:41.379
or carrier or version of the Android platform
that these devices are running, et cetera.

00:24:41.379 --> 00:24:46.229
We've got nice, you know, reports and visualization
stuff here in the developer console.

00:24:46.229 --> 00:24:51.279
And you can also export the data to use as
you see fit offline.

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:55.779
So that's very useful in terms of, like, analyzing
your acquisition funnel; right?

00:24:55.779 --> 00:24:58.640
Figuring out people are getting your games,
how they're downloading it, where they're

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:03.840
coming from, what geographies they're popular
in, might also be kind of a useful early indicator

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:10.070
to figure out what international languages
you should target for localization.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:15.950
But what about once they're actually in your
application?

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:17.139
Then what happens?

00:25:17.139 --> 00:25:22.090
And so Google Analytics is the bit that answers
these questions.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:28.109
You can integrate with Google Analytics and
answer questions like how frequently are users

00:25:28.109 --> 00:25:29.109
running my app?

00:25:29.109 --> 00:25:32.379
Are they running it once a week or ten times
a day?

00:25:32.379 --> 00:25:34.639
What are they doing when they're inside the
application?

00:25:34.639 --> 00:25:37.080
What features are they using or not using?

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:43.789
Or even more interesting, users that end up
performing in-app purchases, what are their

00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:47.859
behavior patterns, how did they get to the
in-app purchase completion?

00:25:47.859 --> 00:25:49.599
Et cetera.

00:25:49.599 --> 00:25:55.249
If you haven't yet integrated with Google
Analytics, you're missing a pretty good opportunity

00:25:55.249 --> 00:26:00.249
to get some really detailed insights into
how your application is performing.

00:26:00.249 --> 00:26:04.779
If you're interested, they have an SDK for
Android, makes it fairly straightforward to

00:26:04.779 --> 00:26:05.889
integrate with.

00:26:05.889 --> 00:26:14.869
And there's a deep-dive session that the Analytics
team is running elsewhere at I/O.

00:26:14.869 --> 00:26:20.389
So we're also bringing insights and metrics
for some of the other services that surround

00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:21.389
Google Play.

00:26:21.389 --> 00:26:24.889
So we announced Google Cloud Messaging today.

00:26:24.889 --> 00:26:30.509
This is the expansion of the Android cloud
to device message and adds new features and

00:26:30.509 --> 00:26:35.289
is now out of beta and complete open and free,
with no quota, for all developers.

00:26:35.289 --> 00:26:41.499
And we've integrated statistics and analytics
from Google Cloud Messaging directly into

00:26:41.499 --> 00:26:42.919
the Google Play developer console.

00:26:42.919 --> 00:26:48.270
So you can see messages about how many metrics
are being sent and once again slice and dice

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:57.779
this across different things like carrier
or, you know, geography, things of this nature.

00:26:57.779 --> 00:27:05.419
Now, with all these additional features coming
to the Google Play dev console, chances are

00:27:05.419 --> 00:27:09.259
that if you have an organization of any size,
there's probably going to be multiple people

00:27:09.259 --> 00:27:12.649
in that organization that want to have access
to it.

00:27:12.649 --> 00:27:17.119
So we've added a feature called multiple user
accounts that allows you to invite other people

00:27:17.119 --> 00:27:21.479
to view your developer console.

00:27:21.479 --> 00:27:27.869
You can also set some access controls to control
who can see the financial and sales information

00:27:27.869 --> 00:27:31.066
versus just administer the apps and things
like that: As administrator, you can add and

00:27:31.066 --> 00:27:32.066
remove access, et cetera.

00:27:32.066 --> 00:27:33.066
The next part gets to distributing your applications.

00:27:33.066 --> 00:27:34.066
&gt;&gt;Chris Yerga: With all these additional features
coming to the Google Play def console, chances

00:27:34.066 --> 00:27:35.066
are if you have an organization of any size,
there's going to be multiple people in that

00:27:35.066 --> 00:27:36.066
organization that want to have access to it.

00:27:36.066 --> 00:27:37.066
We added a feature called multiple user accounts
that allows you to invite other people to

00:27:37.066 --> 00:27:38.066
view your Google Play developer console.

00:27:38.066 --> 00:27:39.066
You can set access controls to control who
can see the financial and sales information

00:27:39.066 --> 00:27:40.066
versus just administer the apps, and things
like that, you can, as administrator, you

00:27:40.066 --> 00:27:41.066
can add and remove access, et cetera.

00:27:41.066 --> 00:27:43.119
Next part gets to distributing your applications,
so we have done a variety of things to help

00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:44.119
here.

00:27:44.119 --> 00:27:46.969
APK expansion files being one of the more
recent ones.

00:27:46.969 --> 00:27:54.950
Prior to APK expansion files, you will remember,
there's a limit of 50 megabytes for an APK

00:27:54.950 --> 00:28:01.450
and with increasing screen sizes and pixel
densities, for graphically rich games, it

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:07.350
simply wasn't enough, and so a lot of developers
had to implement their own secondary download

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:08.909
system.

00:28:08.909 --> 00:28:11.580
With APK expansion files, we now take care
of that for you.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:16.749
So you can add up to two gigabyte expansion
files.

00:28:16.749 --> 00:28:22.039
We not only host and deliver those files for
you, which means that you don't have to -- you

00:28:22.039 --> 00:28:27.259
have to neither invest the engineering resources
to implement that nor incur the cost of hosting

00:28:27.259 --> 00:28:32.320
and bandwidth to distribute them, but it also
gives a much more integrated experience for

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.320
users.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:38.960
So we have a case study here from Glu, before
APK expansion file support came to Google

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:47.809
Play, they were losing customers where they
downloaded the APK but hasn't completed the

00:28:47.809 --> 00:28:50.999
secondary download.

00:28:50.999 --> 00:28:53.649
What that turns into is dissatisfied customers.

00:28:53.649 --> 00:28:57.369
Download the app, you want to play, now I
have this secondary download.

00:28:57.369 --> 00:29:01.659
With APK expansion files, those customers
are more satisfied and Glu is happy, too,

00:29:01.659 --> 00:29:06.009
because we are paying for the downloads and
hosting and they have closed the gap on their

00:29:06.009 --> 00:29:13.929
conversion rate to 96% from the previous stats.

00:29:13.929 --> 00:29:17.589
The other thing we announced today is smart
app updates.

00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:20.190
Pretty simple, right?

00:29:20.190 --> 00:29:23.710
Instead of downloading an entire APK, download
a patch file.

00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:26.240
We do all the work behind the scenes for you.

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:32.649
You really simply don't have to do anything
except upload an updated version of your APK.

00:29:32.649 --> 00:29:37.299
Users download just the changes and on average,
from the analysis we've done, they tend to

00:29:37.299 --> 00:29:42.909
be about a third the size of a full app update.

00:29:42.909 --> 00:29:46.789
We also heard that you wanted to engage more
deeply with your users.

00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:48.739
Reviews is an excellent way to do that.

00:29:48.739 --> 00:29:53.859
So we started the rollout of this new feature
called developer replay to review.

00:29:53.859 --> 00:29:59.169
Developer reply to review, you will be able
to actually respond to a review in a way that

00:29:59.169 --> 00:30:06.539
shows up right there on Google Play and also
you can engage with users that they get an

00:30:06.539 --> 00:30:12.849
email notification and it's a great way to
not only kind of close the loop on feedback,

00:30:12.849 --> 00:30:17.799
like maybe users having problems, you want
additional information for them, et cetera.

00:30:17.799 --> 00:30:22.179
We're initially rolling this out to our top
developer group and we will be expanding this

00:30:22.179 --> 00:30:25.859
in the future.

00:30:25.859 --> 00:30:33.469
The final thing here is the all new, developer.android.com.

00:30:33.469 --> 00:30:38.359
A broader look at what it means to develop
an Android app.

00:30:38.359 --> 00:30:39.739
It's beyond engineering.

00:30:39.739 --> 00:30:43.940
There's design resources there and we also
talk about distribution and other aspects

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.590
of having a successful app business.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:50.470
Whether you are a brand new developer starting
out and you want to get a jump-start at look

00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:55.879
at the free training or maybe even an experienced
developer wanting to learn more about the

00:30:55.879 --> 00:31:05.070
newest APIs that are being released, developer.android.com
is the place to go for that.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:12.119
We put a fair amount of investment into the
Google Play def console over the past year.

00:31:12.119 --> 00:31:13.599
We have seen some of the things today.

00:31:13.599 --> 00:31:16.879
We feel like we can do a heck of a lot better
with it.

00:31:16.879 --> 00:31:22.320
And what I'd like to do now is invite up two
people who have already made it better, Ellie

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:25.320
and Miles are going to give you a demo right
now.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:33.809
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Ellie Powers: Hi everyone, I'm Ellie Powers.

00:31:33.809 --> 00:31:37.849
I'm the product manager for Google app developers
and Google Play.

00:31:37.849 --> 00:31:42.049
&gt;&gt;Miles Barr: I'm Miles Barr, interior manager
for Google Play and developers also.

00:31:42.049 --> 00:31:46.499
&gt;&gt;Ellie Powers: As Chris mentioned, all of
you Android apps developers have already loaded

00:31:46.499 --> 00:31:49.950
600,000 apps into Google Play.

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:51.440
That is astounding.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.320
Thank you for that very much.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:57.070
Now that your businesses are really growing,
20 billion downloads, you're going to need

00:31:57.070 --> 00:32:00.350
a lot better tools to run your businesses
properly.

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:03.490
So we started talking to Android apps developers
everywhere.

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.730
Big businesses, small businesses.

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:09.639
We said, tell us, what are your biggest pain
points?

00:32:09.639 --> 00:32:13.440
What we heard was basically two major things.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:18.679
First of all, app publisher in the developer
console was not as smooth as it should be.

00:32:18.679 --> 00:32:20.029
Not even close.

00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:25.119
And secondly, with a real modern e-commerce
business, you need much, much better tools

00:32:25.119 --> 00:32:31.429
that give you not just data about your users
but real insight into your businesses.

00:32:31.429 --> 00:32:37.029
So one developer we spoke to said, we use
this site so much, it's so critical to our

00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:38.029
business.

00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:39.190
Do we use it every day?

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:40.190
Not just that.

00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:46.109
We are actually in the tool all day every
day constantly tweaking our offerings.

00:32:46.109 --> 00:32:51.749
So with that, we said, we could fix a few
things here and there, make small improvements.

00:32:51.749 --> 00:32:53.779
But that wasn't going to work.

00:32:53.779 --> 00:32:54.779
No way.

00:32:54.779 --> 00:32:59.649
We went completely back to the drawing board
and we said, let's revamp app publishing completely

00:32:59.649 --> 00:33:03.320
and let's build a real foundation that can
become the future of what we want to offer

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:08.090
Android apps developers and Google Play to
manage their businesses.

00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:13.629
We are happy to announce today that the Google
Play developer console, brand new one, is

00:33:13.629 --> 00:33:15.659
in limited beta.

00:33:15.659 --> 00:33:19.419
We would love to have you check it out very
soon and let us know what you think.

00:33:19.419 --> 00:33:22.990
Your feedback is really crucial to making
sure that it really fits the way your business

00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.990
runs.

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:25.149
So let's have a look at it.

00:33:25.149 --> 00:33:26.149
Miles.

00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:28.209
All right, so there it is.

00:33:28.209 --> 00:33:31.820
There's really not much to see at first because
we don't have any apps yet.

00:33:31.820 --> 00:33:35.090
But you will immediately notice that we have
a brand new look and feel.

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:39.169
It's a lot easier to see where you are in
the site and it's a lot easier to navigate

00:33:39.169 --> 00:33:41.769
anywhere that you need to go.

00:33:41.769 --> 00:33:46.080
So to show you the brand new app publishing
experience, what would make more sense than

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:52.019
to actually publish a brand new app into Google
Play right now from the stage at I/O. Let's

00:33:52.019 --> 00:33:53.229
do that.

00:33:53.229 --> 00:33:54.249
Okay.

00:33:54.249 --> 00:33:56.099
So we wrote a simple little app.

00:33:56.099 --> 00:33:59.539
It's called the Handy Developer Guide, we
are going to publish it today.

00:33:59.539 --> 00:34:03.360
One of key things you told us, when you are
publishing a new app, you need to be able

00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.619
to do it piece by piece.

00:34:05.619 --> 00:34:09.470
Sometimes you have the APK but you don't have
the text.

00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:13.960
Other times, you might have some of the graphics
ready but not the APK.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:14.960
Don't worry.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.020
That's not going to be a problem anymore.

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.869
You can get started with whatever you have.

00:34:17.869 --> 00:34:19.350
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Ellie Powers: Thank you.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:22.139
We really want to take your feedback.

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:23.690
Seriously, guys.

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:28.250
Okay, so here today we do have an APK on hand.

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:29.720
I wrote it my very self.

00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:32.260
It's not the best one, but it's great for
our demo.

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.529
So Miles is going to go ahead and upload it.

00:34:34.529 --> 00:34:36.730
The developer guide.

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:38.929
There we go.

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:45.639
So once this is done up uploading, we will
be able to review key details of this app.

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:48.139
Things like what API level is it using?

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:50.279
How many languages does it support?

00:34:50.279 --> 00:34:52.289
What screen resolutions and so on.

00:34:52.289 --> 00:34:56.039
So let's give it a good look to make sure
we have gotten everything right.

00:34:56.039 --> 00:34:57.530
I think that looks pretty good.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:35:01.450
There's definitely a lot of devices supported,
so I'm happy with that.

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:08.299
Another big piece of feedback that we heard
was, well, this form, it's this big form and

00:35:08.299 --> 00:35:10.010
I really can't tell where I am.

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:11.010
Is my app published?

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:12.440
Is it not?

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.760
What parts do I still have left to do?

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:16.790
It was confusing, really.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:18.279
So we tried to fix all that.

00:35:18.279 --> 00:35:21.370
At any point you can look in the upper right-hand
corner of the screen.

00:35:21.370 --> 00:35:25.000
You can clearly see that this is in a draft
state; it has not been published yet.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.180
If we are not sure what we still need to do,
we can click there at any time and it will

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:33.079
give us a list of this is what you need to
do to publish your app.

00:35:33.079 --> 00:35:37.300
We can see from the check mark that this APK
is totally fine, we're all set.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.329
It's time to move on to the store listing.

00:35:40.329 --> 00:35:42.279
Okay.

00:35:42.279 --> 00:35:45.320
So Miles is going to enter the description
of this little app.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.140
It doesn't do very much, so it shouldn't take
him too long.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:50.760
One important thing that Chris mentioned is
all of the international growth.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:51.920
It is huge.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.900
It is really astounding.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:57.789
It's really a priority to make sure that each
one of your businesses no matter where in

00:35:57.789 --> 00:36:02.109
the world you are based that you are able
to reach users all over the world.

00:36:02.109 --> 00:36:06.161
Users who speak many different languages,
users you have never met before, your business

00:36:06.161 --> 00:36:08.230
should be able to expand to them.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:11.920
Two-thirds of the revenue is outside the country
of the U.S. and your businesses should be

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.359
as well.

00:36:13.359 --> 00:36:20.859
So we recently just launched the Play store
on the web no an additional 22 languages.

00:36:20.859 --> 00:36:22.829
You may recognize many of them.

00:36:22.829 --> 00:36:29.170
Everything from UK English all the way down
to, you know, other ones like -- what else

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:30.170
did we launch.

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:33.289
I think we launched Zulu.

00:36:33.289 --> 00:36:36.960
So for our little demo today, we will add
Korean.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.559
Chris made a great case study for that 14X
growth.

00:36:40.559 --> 00:36:45.410
Miles is going to go ahead and add a translation
in Korean.

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:47.410
Okay.

00:36:47.410 --> 00:36:49.680
Let's put Handy Developer Guide in Korean.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:53.430
&gt;&gt;Miles Barr: One problem, I don't speak Korean.

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:55.180
&gt;&gt;Ellie Powers: Me neither.

00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.920
What should we do?

00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:00.720
&gt;&gt;Miles Barr: Let's get rid of Korean and
rely on the auto translate feature.

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.529
&gt;&gt;Ellie Powers: That's a great idea.

00:37:02.529 --> 00:37:07.769
One of the thing we heard from users is, I
may not speak a language where a certain developer

00:37:07.769 --> 00:37:12.359
has provided human translation already but
I still want to learn with that app.

00:37:12.359 --> 00:37:17.940
With Google, we have Google translate, how
can we put that work for you and your users?

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:22.700
What will happen will automatic translations
a user who goes to the play store will be

00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.950
able to see either the original language that
you've provided or an automated translation

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:28.980
in their native language.

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:32.579
And to keep this updated properly, you don't
have to do anything at all.

00:37:32.579 --> 00:37:37.210
The automated translates updates any time
you update your translation.

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:38.210
Okay.

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:43.240
So until Miles or I finish our Korean lessons,
we will let automated translation do its job.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.910
Let's move on to the fun part.

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:46.809
Screen shots.

00:37:46.809 --> 00:37:49.869
We will do the minimum.

00:37:49.869 --> 00:37:53.839
Two screen shots of the app, and this is really
not the best practice.

00:37:53.839 --> 00:37:54.890
Yes.

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:58.890
As you can see here we have a great graphic
designer who has made us fantastic graphics

00:37:58.890 --> 00:37:59.890
to promote the app.

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:04.359
Now, if this were a real app that we would
have great success on, we need to do a couple

00:38:04.359 --> 00:38:05.470
things.

00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:08.819
We could have a screen shot of the app running
on the new Nexus 7 tablet.

00:38:08.819 --> 00:38:12.519
That would be fantastics, especially if it
has tablet-specific features.

00:38:12.519 --> 00:38:18.029
A user can see, yes, if I download this on
to my tablet, if I install it, maybe I'm willing

00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:21.730
to pay even a little bit more because I know
that the tablet version is going to be so

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:22.730
great.

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:25.900
Another real important thing I want to mention
here is the feature graphic.

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:31.030
So when you make your store listing on the
web, the main center point of it is the feature

00:38:31.030 --> 00:38:32.030
graphic.

00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:33.839
It's the big banner that users see when they
go there.

00:38:33.839 --> 00:38:35.210
You definitely want to have it there.

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:40.849
If our editorial team is looking to feature
your app, a feature graphic is absolutely

00:38:40.849 --> 00:38:42.210
a must have.

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:45.030
So okay, Miles, are we all set there?

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:51.611
Okay, one more thing that a lot of top developers
mention to us, they said, okay, how do I take

00:38:51.611 --> 00:38:53.800
my lesson to the next level of professionalism.

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:55.890
I actually need a video.

00:38:55.890 --> 00:39:00.570
Especially if you're working on a really novel
app that doing something interesting and different.

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:04.940
Nothing like a video explains to a users,
hey, when you get the app on your phone, do

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:09.269
this, here's why it's cool, here's how you
use it, it's really fun, definitely recommend

00:39:09.269 --> 00:39:11.319
your video there as well.

00:39:11.319 --> 00:39:14.849
So it's pretty clear at this point that one
of the key things is the better that you can

00:39:14.849 --> 00:39:18.990
communicate with your users about the value
of your app, the better off you're going to

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:19.990
be.

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:24.390
So along that theme, earlier this year we
introduced privacy policy URLs.

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:27.769
So for the past couple months, you have been
able to go into the developer console and

00:39:27.769 --> 00:39:33.140
enter a privacy policy URL for each app you
have should you wish to do so.

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:37.940
As of today, users browsing Google Play, the
privacy policy URLs will be visible.

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:42.690
This is a great way to evaluate your apps
in Google Play.

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.039
Looks like we are at the bottom of the page.

00:39:44.039 --> 00:39:45.460
We will scroll up.

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:48.789
We are going to save.

00:39:48.789 --> 00:39:49.789
Okay.

00:39:49.789 --> 00:39:52.280
So our last step is going to be pricing and
distribution.

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.920
This is a simple app.

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.430
We are going to make it available for free.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:39:57.430
I wouldn't pay for it.

00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:58.430
Distribute it everywhere.

00:39:58.430 --> 00:40:01.260
We are also going to agree to the policies.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:04.009
Definitely have a look through these if you
haven't done so recently just to make sure

00:40:04.009 --> 00:40:06.820
that you are aware of how the rules go.

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:08.210
Okay, how are we doing?

00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:10.710
Wow, ready to publish.

00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:11.960
That's cool.

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:14.250
&gt;&gt;Miles Barr: Let's publish this.

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:15.250
&gt;&gt;Ellie Powers: Okay.

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:16.720
We will do it.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.819
So this is a real thing happening.

00:40:19.819 --> 00:40:23.059
We are actually sending our app off into the
Google Play store.

00:40:23.059 --> 00:40:27.190
After we do this, you will really be able
to download your app on your very own phone

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:31.079
and tablet, try it out, have a look, and there
we go.

00:40:31.079 --> 00:40:34.089
&gt;&gt;Miles Barr: Actually, Ellie, I think I uploaded
the wrong APK.

00:40:34.089 --> 00:40:36.569
&gt;&gt;Ellie Powers: Are you serious?

00:40:36.569 --> 00:40:38.280
Come on, we are on stage.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:40.359
All right, are we going to fix this?

00:40:40.359 --> 00:40:42.470
&gt;&gt;Miles Barr: Let's upload the proper version.

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:46.640
&gt;&gt;Ellie Powers: So Miles is going to upload
this new version.

00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:47.880
All right.

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.880
Let's have a look.

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:51.440
We are actually going to see the cool comparison
right now.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:55.190
&gt;&gt;Miles Barr: Hang on, 23 devices have been
removed.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:56.619
&gt;&gt;Ellie Powers: Why is that?

00:40:56.619 --> 00:40:57.619
That's not good.

00:40:57.619 --> 00:40:58.619
&gt;&gt;Miles Barr: Bluetooth?

00:40:58.619 --> 00:41:00.620
Why does a set of links need Bluetooth.

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:06.609
&gt;&gt;Ellie Powers: I must have pasted that into
the wrong app when I was updating my app this

00:41:06.609 --> 00:41:07.609
morning.

00:41:07.609 --> 00:41:09.309
This app is a obviously bad version.

00:41:09.309 --> 00:41:10.910
&gt;&gt;Miles Barr: Let's get rid of it then.

00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:14.910
&gt;&gt;Ellie Powers: We have heard from developers
that that has happened, with the new comparisons

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:18.960
tool, we will make sure that you never do
an oopsy update again.

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:25.950
Here we go, we have published our app, waiting
it to show up in the store, let's look at

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:28.690
some stats from an existing app that we have.

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:33.480
So a lot of you said that the current developer
console is too slow.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.180
Does anyone have a lot of apps?

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:38.430
A hundred or maybe a thousand or ten thousand.

00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:39.829
It gets really slow.

00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:43.529
With the new search box, you can jump exactly
to the one that you want and the whole site

00:41:43.529 --> 00:41:45.579
runs a lot faster.

00:41:45.579 --> 00:41:48.890
As Chris mentioned, we update the statistics
this year.

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:53.869
You can see a lot of great data about your
user installs, upgrades, everything likes

00:41:53.869 --> 00:41:54.869
that.

00:41:54.869 --> 00:41:58.599
You can break it down by these six dimensions,
export it, do more analysis.

00:41:58.599 --> 00:42:00.130
It's really handy.

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:03.109
So most of you are probably familiar with
this already.

00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:06.059
Okay, let's have a look at the reviews.

00:42:06.059 --> 00:42:07.770
Here's what it looks like in the new site.

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:12.170
Earlier this year we introduced the ability
to see your app version, your device and the

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:15.519
language from each of the reviews that users
are leaving.

00:42:15.519 --> 00:42:20.200
I like to use this all the time to understand
who are these people giving me one star?

00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:24.579
What do they have in common and how can I
try to make them a bit happier.

00:42:24.579 --> 00:42:25.579
Okay.

00:42:25.579 --> 00:42:29.460
And if Miles and I were top developers, which
we are not, we would be able to reply to users

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:30.460
reviews.

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:34.450
We want to roll that out to more developers
in the future, as well.

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:36.960
All right, so that's it.

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.200
That's the new developer console.

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:47.109
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Ellie Powers: We've had a fantastic team

00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:52.589
of designers, engineers, testers, localization
people, everyone working together to really

00:42:52.589 --> 00:42:55.140
bring this to you to make it a core part of
your business.

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:59.480
We are really going to love to hear your feedback
as soon as possible.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:04.730
Soon we will be recruiting for more developers
to try it out, be among the first to see it.

00:43:04.730 --> 00:43:08.231
If you'd like to be in the next group, we
will be soon making a link available in the

00:43:08.231 --> 00:43:11.880
developer console where you will be able to
sign up.

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:12.920
Please do check it out.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:15.549
Let us know what you think, and we really
do care.

00:43:15.549 --> 00:43:19.640
Thank you so much for all you've done to make
Google Play great and we really look forward

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:22.390
to bringing you even more over the next year.

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:23.390
Thank you.

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:24.390
&gt;&gt;Miles Barr: Thank you everyone.

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:27.690
Back to you, Chris.

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:31.950
&gt;&gt;Chris Yerga: Thank you Ellie and Miles.

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:36.329
So I want to do one other brief demo here
for you.

00:43:36.329 --> 00:43:42.720
So just over a year ago we launched the web
version of then Android Market now Google

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:50.970
Play and one of the novel features we had
at that time was this -- the ability to purchase

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:56.050
an app directly from the web site and have
it install directly to your device.

00:43:56.050 --> 00:44:00.390
Since that time when we pulled all the content
together on Google Play, we have added the

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:04.559
section at the top where you can get to your
library so you can see all your music and

00:44:04.559 --> 00:44:08.309
your books and now your magazines and TV as
well.

00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:13.770
As part of that, we've also revamped the way
that you can go in and take a look at all

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:17.400
of your Android apps that are installed across
the variety of devices.

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:23.069
And that last point is actually very important
because Android is now getting to a point

00:44:23.069 --> 00:44:28.039
where users are more frequently have multiple
devices.

00:44:28.039 --> 00:44:32.440
They might have a phone and a tablet or multiple
phones, et cetera.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:38.599
And so now with the new my applications section
here, you can actually go across and look

00:44:38.599 --> 00:44:43.849
at the apps that have been installed on a
variety of your devices and you also get a

00:44:43.849 --> 00:44:49.369
view into the apps that are in your library
that haven't yet been installed.

00:44:49.369 --> 00:44:55.299
Think about the scenario where a user has
purchased one of your applications, gets a

00:44:55.299 --> 00:44:59.549
second device right, there's that kind of
awkward period where you've got to -- I have

00:44:59.549 --> 00:45:02.849
to install the apps and go through and figure
out what things I like.

00:45:02.849 --> 00:45:07.190
It's really easy, particularly for someone
like me who has been on Android for quite

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:11.880
a while and has amassed quite a number of
apps in their library, to quickly go through

00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:15.840
here and install those apps to their new devices.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:22.640
You can also delete applications from your
device and we think it's a great way for users

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:27.710
to basically get all of their app story pulled
together through the power of the Cloud much

00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:30.980
like the rest of our content.

00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:41.950
If we could switch back to the slides now.

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:48.730
We're going to take things out here with five
top tips for 2012.

00:45:48.730 --> 00:45:54.450
So things that I would recommend that you
spend energy on if you haven't yet.

00:45:54.450 --> 00:46:00.670
And the first thing we want to start with
is this notion of focus on the user.

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:04.319
Usability, design, user feedback.

00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:09.230
At the end of the day, obviously, the -- you
know, the goal here is delight your users

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:13.029
and have them have an excellent product experience.

00:46:13.029 --> 00:46:21.460
And I think users' expectations for Mobile
applications have gotten fairly high, right?

00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:27.269
I mean, as everybody is sort of raising their
game in terms of user experience and app development.

00:46:27.269 --> 00:46:31.569
And so I think there's a couple things that
are worthy to mention here.

00:46:31.569 --> 00:46:34.750
The first is really making benefit of user
reviews.

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:40.930
You want to aim to have a great app with great
design, great usability that users are going

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:43.030
to rate highly for a couple reasons.

00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:48.630
One is high ratings in the Google Play store
is every racer who rates your app highly is

00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:53.240
promoting your application to others who come
through the store and it's an opportunity

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:55.450
for you to close those conversions.

00:46:55.450 --> 00:47:01.200
Also reviews are a great way to get feedback
about issues you might be having in your applications.

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:05.250
I wanted to talk a little bit about what we
mean when we say focus on the user from a

00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:08.269
case study here from this app called Pocket.

00:47:08.269 --> 00:47:14.990
Pocket's a cool app that lets you basically
clip content from the web or videos or blogs

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:20.430
or things like that and all bring them together
in a single, unified reading experience.

00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:28.160
And what Pocket did is they've built their
application from the ground up on Android.

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:36.380
So they make use of the Android framework
owes share intent so that you can add share

00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:41.329
intent to the Pocket application from all
of other Android apps, they also use a cloud-to-device

00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:48.050
messaging and you can clip from the web and
send a notification to the Pocket web running

00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:54.190
on the Android device, basically everything
to have that sort of unique Android experience.

00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:58.660
And I think when they first started off and
this is probably true for a number of developers

00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:03.519
early on it wasn't really apparent like what
the best practices for Android apps should

00:48:03.519 --> 00:48:05.279
look like.

00:48:05.279 --> 00:48:14.180
Now with the release of our Android UX guidelines
and design guidelines, we make that much easier.

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:19.849
So I'd encourage you to take a look at the
UX and design guidelines and there's a few

00:48:19.849 --> 00:48:23.170
other things you could consider doing here.

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:25.450
Do beta tests.

00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:30.000
Reach out to users, maybe have a usability
study of your application.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:36.009
Think hard about all the things you can do
to deliver a compelling experience to your

00:48:36.009 --> 00:48:37.910
users.

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:44.119
so the next thing, obviously, we've been talking
a lot about is localization.

00:48:44.119 --> 00:48:50.319
Think about what are the different regions
that I want to take my app to and think about

00:48:50.319 --> 00:48:56.289
the global marketplace that's available there
and how you can reach it.

00:48:56.289 --> 00:49:02.769
Maybe you start with just localizing your
Google Play store listing or maybe eventually

00:49:02.769 --> 00:49:08.220
engage with a professional translation firm
or take advantage of the auto translation

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:10.589
feature that we heard about.

00:49:10.589 --> 00:49:16.039
Now, localization is -- takes many forms.

00:49:16.039 --> 00:49:19.150
One case study we want to talk about here
is Foursquare.

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:25.160
So Foursquare, as you know, it's a local app
where people can check in at various venues,

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:31.609
et cetera, and one thing that they noticed
is that they started to have growth outside

00:49:31.609 --> 00:49:35.079
of the U.S. in an interesting way.

00:49:35.079 --> 00:49:42.519
They had users that were actually helping
to build out their location database for them

00:49:42.519 --> 00:49:48.230
predominantly started with native English-speakers
who were abroad, but by building out their

00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:53.970
location database for them, these users were
really helping them grow and provide a compelling

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.700
experience to users outside of the U.S.

00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:04.250
So they invent advised that by giving batchers
to these super users to encourage this behavior.

00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:10.900
They did anales to the places where the greatest
amount of activity was happening and then

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:15.740
they then localized their application into
a dozen languages to target those different

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.040
markets.

00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:22.450
And the result of that is now fully 50% of
their user base is now outside of the U.S.

00:50:22.450 --> 00:50:28.789
So that's a way for you to think about ways
to sort of get your app available into different

00:50:28.789 --> 00:50:29.789
markets.

00:50:29.789 --> 00:50:36.270
the third thing to tab here is making your
app look great on tablets, a lot of Android

00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:40.349
tablets are going to be sold this year particularly
around the holiday season and we think that

00:50:40.349 --> 00:50:43.090
we've just released a killer one with the
Nexus 7.

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:49.240
So, you know, tablet users don't just want
an exploded-up version of a phone application

00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:56.839
so think about how you can make your applications
tablet-optimized and deliver a really compelling

00:50:56.839 --> 00:50:59.079
experience on tablets.

00:50:59.079 --> 00:51:05.019
A case study I want to get in here is from
mint.com who I think really did an excellent

00:51:05.019 --> 00:51:06.499
job of this.

00:51:06.499 --> 00:51:13.390
So what Mint does -- they use the Android
fragments APIs fairly -- fairly extensively,

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:19.960
they have an application that adapts itself
dynamically to phones and tablets, they've

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:24.570
done, actually both seven-inch and 10-inch
optimized versions of their application on

00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:25.570
tablets.

00:51:25.570 --> 00:51:31.099
And using the fragments API it actually -- adapting
their 10-inch tablet layout to support seven-inch

00:51:31.099 --> 00:51:36.530
tablets, something they got done in under
a week.

00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:44.240
The other thing they noticed, however, is
that the usage patterns of their applications

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.810
varied significantly between phones and tablets.

00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:53.549
So what Mint saw is that on phones they would
see kind of peak usage around midday, maybe

00:51:53.549 --> 00:51:57.980
around lunchtime or something like that but
the duration of those sessions were fairly

00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:59.380
short.

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:02.690
People would make just go in and check their
bills or check their balances or something

00:52:02.690 --> 00:52:08.829
like that but tablet users would peak much
later in the day, in the evening time or after

00:52:08.829 --> 00:52:13.490
dinner, and those sessions lasted much longer
and those users were much more engaged with

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:15.530
their devices.

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:20.410
And so the way Mint put that information to
use for them is in their tablet versions of

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:25.010
their applications they actually added new
features there that aren't present on the

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:30.999
phone to enable users to engage with their
budget and do more things in the mode where

00:52:30.999 --> 00:52:34.170
they're kind of willing to more deeply engage
there.

00:52:34.170 --> 00:52:39.750
So the other thing that you could do here
is actually Mint added tablet screen shots

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:43.720
to the play store to promote the fact that
they have this sort of premium experience

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:44.759
on tablets.

00:52:44.759 --> 00:52:49.059
So think hard about how to reach tablet users
and the things that you can do to deliver

00:52:49.059 --> 00:52:54.670
and experience to them that really leverages,
you know, the capabilities of their device

00:52:54.670 --> 00:53:02.089
rather than giving them just a translated
phone experience.

00:53:02.089 --> 00:53:04.280
number four here is revenue model.

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:09.940
You know, think creatively and figure out
what's the best revenue model for my application.

00:53:09.940 --> 00:53:14.170
As we've talked about a couple times here,
there's a variety of different models here.

00:53:14.170 --> 00:53:20.140
You know, if you look at the sort of top grossing
charts in the Google Play store, a lot of

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:26.109
those apps are Freemium apps, right, free
apps that sell in-app purchases, but not all

00:53:26.109 --> 00:53:27.109
of them are.

00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:31.980
So, you know, there's no sort of one-size-fits-all
model for success.

00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:37.480
So maybe if you haven't considered this in
a while, it's time to think if there's a different

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.549
way to monetize your apps.

00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:47.180
An example here is from the folks at Cellfish
C-E-L-L-fish, see what they did there?

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:52.559
And they sell these live wallpapers and they
license things from movies and sports teams

00:53:52.559 --> 00:53:54.109
and things like that.

00:53:54.109 --> 00:53:59.720
And when they started out, they had a paid
app version of their live wallpaper that they

00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:05.660
sold, but they decided to try a different
tack and so what they did is they offered

00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:14.750
a free version of their app that only offered
some sort of generic NFL branding and then,

00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:19.769
from within the application they enabled people
to purchase, you know, custom versions for

00:54:19.769 --> 00:54:23.140
their favorite sports teams and things like
that.

00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:26.509
They also went a step further and they offered
packages.

00:54:26.509 --> 00:54:31.499
So you could maybe get the live wallpaper
as well as a ring tone or theme or something

00:54:31.499 --> 00:54:32.680
else as a bundle.

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:37.529
It's like, well, just another dollar more
for the upsell and you get this package deal

00:54:37.529 --> 00:54:39.989
and they've had great success with this model.

00:54:39.989 --> 00:54:44.019
The other thing that they did which is something
that we've mentioned earlier as well is keeping

00:54:44.019 --> 00:54:45.920
their content fresh.

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:51.539
So they've done like seasonal customizations,
you know, around the holiday times and things

00:54:51.539 --> 00:54:52.539
like that.

00:54:52.539 --> 00:54:58.050
And when the Giants won the Super Bowl, they
actually had confetti flying in the live wallpaper

00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:04.730
just a few minutes after the end of the game
So, you know, think about how inapp or something

00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:10.579
like subscriptions work for your application
and figure out if there's some creative ways

00:55:10.579 --> 00:55:15.089
you could reconsider your business models
if you haven't really given that a look in

00:55:15.089 --> 00:55:19.910
a while
so the final thing we want to talk about today

00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:26.210
in terms of our tips is investing in analytics
and marketing.

00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:31.319
We talked a lot about, you know, Google analytics
and the insight it gives you and once you've

00:55:31.319 --> 00:55:37.891
made the investment to build a really compelling
application experience, you know, you want

00:55:37.891 --> 00:55:39.630
to like tell the world about it.

00:55:39.630 --> 00:55:43.480
You want to invest in marketing and promotion
to get it out there.

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:49.619
And you can think creatively there's a variety
of different ways to do that.

00:55:49.619 --> 00:55:58.650
So I want to talk here about a case study
with Smule, so their marketing is not terribly

00:55:58.650 --> 00:55:59.650
traditional.

00:55:59.650 --> 00:56:05.869
They make these really cool apps like Magic
Piano and Songify that use your phone in creative

00:56:05.869 --> 00:56:07.509
ways that are musical in nature.

00:56:07.509 --> 00:56:13.180
So because their apps are so musical, video
is a really effective way for them to get

00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:14.740
their point across.

00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:22.700
And so it turns out that, you know, they get
a lot of engagement from video ads as well

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:24.349
as YouTube channels.

00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:31.319
They partnered with some of these YouTube
superstars to focus on use either their products

00:56:31.319 --> 00:56:36.630
in their videos or do videos about using their
products and they found some interesting thing,

00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:45.980
when they combined that marketing and promotion
with analytics, what they saw was that users

00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:51.950
who inquired the app through this Jimmy Wong
video on YouTube, once they actually had the

00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:58.510
app were twice as engaged with the app and
used it a lot more than a other users.

00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:04.099
And when they took a look at this, they found
that the reason was that in the video, it

00:57:04.099 --> 00:57:08.239
was actually very good at explaining how to
use the application and so they got a whole

00:57:08.239 --> 00:57:13.369
'nother level of insight there on not only
how am I doing a conversion, how am I getting

00:57:13.369 --> 00:57:20.140
a customer to acquire my application, but
how am I also using these channels to get

00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:24.489
customers who are more engaged with my app
and actually have a better understanding of

00:57:24.489 --> 00:57:30.740
the value that they're getting as well.

00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:35.990
In summary, focus on the user, localize your
apps, make it look great on tablets, find

00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:40.819
your revenue model, use any of the variety
of ways to monetize your app and make sure

00:57:40.819 --> 00:57:43.970
that you invest in analytics and marketing.

00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:47.279
Before we close out today, I want to give
a little bit of a shout out to some other

00:57:47.279 --> 00:57:49.559
sessions that are coming up.

00:57:49.559 --> 00:57:53.609
We only had a little bit of time here so we
weren't able to really deep dive into some

00:57:53.609 --> 00:57:57.180
of these topics but there will be there's
going to be folks here in this very same room

00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:59.020
coming up next that are going to do that.

00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:06.960
I believe the next session is going to deep
dive on Android app monetization and then

00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:12.489
there's going to be a session on marketing
and promoting your apps in Google Play.

00:58:12.489 --> 00:58:16.249
So with that, I started with a thank you,
I'll end with a thank you.

00:58:16.249 --> 00:58:18.509
Thank you very much for your attention and
your very hard work.

00:58:18.509 --> 00:58:18.649
[ Applause ]
