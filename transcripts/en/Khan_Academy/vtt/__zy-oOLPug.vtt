00:00:00.874 --> 00:00:02.385
- [Voiceover] When
you're studying chemistry

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:03.894
you'll often see reactions,

00:00:03.894 --> 00:00:05.903
in fact you always see reactions.

00:00:05.903 --> 00:00:08.902
For example if you have hydrogen gas

00:00:09.665 --> 00:00:11.086
it's a diatomic molecule,

00:00:11.086 --> 00:00:13.558
'cause hydrogen bonds with
itself in the gassy state,

00:00:13.558 --> 00:00:15.459
plus iodine gas,

00:00:17.403 --> 00:00:18.944
I2, that's also in the gassy state,

00:00:18.944 --> 00:00:20.385
it's very easy to just sort of,

00:00:20.385 --> 00:00:22.018
oh you know, if you put 'em together

00:00:22.018 --> 00:00:24.202
they're going to react
and form the product,

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:26.209
if you have two moles of,

00:00:26.209 --> 00:00:28.528
hydrogen, two moles of iodine,

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:31.383
so it's gonna form two moles of

00:00:31.383 --> 00:00:34.314
hydrogen iodide.

00:00:35.053 --> 00:00:36.731
That's all nice and neat

00:00:36.731 --> 00:00:38.873
and it makes it seem like
it's a very clean thing

00:00:38.873 --> 00:00:41.069
that happens without much fuss.

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:43.069
But we know that that isn't the reality

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:45.271
and we also know that this
doesn't happen just instantly,

00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:47.001
it's not like you can
just take some hydrogen,

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:49.777
put it with some iodine,

00:00:49.777 --> 00:00:52.179
and it just magically
turns into hydrogen iodide.

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:53.827
That there's some process going on,

00:00:53.827 --> 00:00:57.530
that these gaseous state
particles are bouncing around,

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.541
and somehow they must
bounce into each other

00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:02.341
and break bonds that they were in before,

00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:03.867
and form new ones,

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:05.201
and that's what we're going to study now.

00:01:05.201 --> 00:01:08.428
This whole study of how
the reaction progresses,

00:01:08.428 --> 00:01:11.104
and the rates of the
reactions is called kinetics.

00:01:11.576 --> 00:01:13.356
Which is a very fancy word,

00:01:13.356 --> 00:01:14.571
but you're probably familiar with it

00:01:14.571 --> 00:01:16.370
because we've talked a
lot about kinetic energy.

00:01:16.945 --> 00:01:18.180
Kinetics.

00:01:20.897 --> 00:01:24.022
Which is just the study
of the rate of reactions.

00:01:24.202 --> 00:01:26.564
How fast do they happen,
and how do they happen?

00:01:26.857 --> 00:01:28.281
So let's just in our minds,

00:01:28.281 --> 00:01:30.332
come up with a intuitive way

00:01:30.332 --> 00:01:33.065
that hydrogen and iodine can combine.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.860
So let's think about
what hydrogen looks like.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.620
So if we get our periodic table out,

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.764
hydrogen's got one valence electron

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:40.708
so if they have two hydrogen atoms

00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:42.245
they can share them with each other.

00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:43.836
And then iodine,

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:47.408
iodine has seven valence electrons,

00:01:47.408 --> 00:01:49.800
so if they each share one
they get complete as well.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.880
So let's just review that right now.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.336
So hydrogen

00:01:53.336 --> 00:01:54.976
this hydrogen might have one,

00:01:55.622 --> 00:01:58.197
well, will have one electron out there.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.961
And then you can have another hydrogen

00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:02.163
that has another electron out there,

00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:04.663
and then if they form
a bond they share this,

00:02:04.663 --> 00:02:07.240
this hydrogen can pretend
like he has this electron,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.431
this hydrogen can pretend
like she has that electron,

00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:10.261
and then they're happy.

00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:13.447
They both feel like they've
completed their 1S shell.

00:02:13.447 --> 00:02:15.827
Same thing on the iodine side.

00:02:16.613 --> 00:02:17.950
Where you have two iodines,

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.905
they both have seven valence electrons.

00:02:20.514 --> 00:02:22.260
They're halogens,

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.527
you know that already.

00:02:24.332 --> 00:02:26.195
Halogens are the group seven elements,

00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:28.824
so they have seven electrons

00:02:29.004 --> 00:02:31.348
this guy's got one here,
this guy's got one here,

00:02:31.348 --> 00:02:33.243
if this guy can pretend
like he's got that electron,

00:02:33.243 --> 00:02:35.220
he's happy, he has
eight valence electrons.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.178
If this guy can pretend
like he's got that one,

00:02:37.178 --> 00:02:38.084
same thing.

00:02:38.084 --> 00:02:39.801
So there's a bond right here,

00:02:39.801 --> 00:02:43.853
and this is why hydrogen is
a diatomic molecular gas,

00:02:44.041 --> 00:02:45.741
and this is why iodine is the same.

00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:48.553
Now, when they're in the gaseous state,

00:02:48.553 --> 00:02:50.929
you have a bunch of these things that are

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:53.239
moving around bumping into each other,

00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:54.420
I'll do it like this.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.456
So the hydrogen might
look something like this,

00:02:57.668 --> 00:03:00.768
the hydrogen is these two atomic spheres

00:03:00.772 --> 00:03:02.051
that are bonded together,

00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:05.180
these electrons in between
that are keeping them bonded.

00:03:05.483 --> 00:03:07.235
The iodine might look something like this,

00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:08.828
it's a much bigger molecule.

00:03:10.785 --> 00:03:12.740
Where it's bonded together like this,

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:16.044
it's also sharing some
electrons in a covalent bond,

00:03:16.531 --> 00:03:17.984
everything's probabilistic.

00:03:17.984 --> 00:03:20.961
So in order for these two
molecules to turn to this,

00:03:20.961 --> 00:03:22.854
somehow these bonds have to be broken,

00:03:22.854 --> 00:03:24.498
and new bonds have to be formed.

00:03:24.734 --> 00:03:26.278
And what has to happen is that these guys,

00:03:26.278 --> 00:03:27.525
there's a ton of these guys.

00:03:27.525 --> 00:03:29.071
I could draw a bunch of them.

00:03:29.071 --> 00:03:30.790
Or I could copy and paste.

00:03:31.636 --> 00:03:33.234
So there's a bunch of...

00:03:34.177 --> 00:03:37.094
There's a bunch of
hydrogen molecules around,

00:03:37.094 --> 00:03:40.658
and some of these iodine

00:03:40.918 --> 00:03:42.730
gas molecules around.

00:03:45.246 --> 00:03:46.631
So what has to happen in order for us

00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:47.918
to get the hydrogen iodide is,

00:03:47.918 --> 00:03:48.783
they have to collide.

00:03:48.783 --> 00:03:50.654
And they have to collide
in exactly the right way.

00:03:50.654 --> 00:03:52.635
So let's say this guy,
wish I could show it.

00:03:52.635 --> 00:03:54.315
Let's say he's moving, this is neat,

00:03:54.315 --> 00:03:55.587
I'm just dragging and dropping.

00:03:55.587 --> 00:03:56.355
But he's moving.

00:03:56.355 --> 00:03:59.935
He has to hit this hydrogen
molecule just right,

00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:02.808
And maybe just right, if
he just happens to hit it

00:04:02.808 --> 00:04:04.623
and bounce it with enough energy,

00:04:04.623 --> 00:04:05.959
then all of the sudden,

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:07.711
let's say we get to this point right here,

00:04:08.741 --> 00:04:10.624
these electrons are
gonna say "Hey, you know,

00:04:10.624 --> 00:04:12.971
"it's nice to be shared this way,

00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:14.465
"we're in a stable configuration,

00:04:14.465 --> 00:04:16.156
"we're filling the 1S
shell, but look at this,

00:04:16.156 --> 00:04:18.685
"there's this iodine that's close by

00:04:18.685 --> 00:04:20.114
"and they really want me,

00:04:20.114 --> 00:04:21.828
"they're much more electro-negative

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:23.423
"than me, the hydrogen".

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.148
So maybe they're kind of attracted here,

00:04:25.148 --> 00:04:26.402
they don't know whether they wanna be

00:04:26.402 --> 00:04:28.459
here between that hydrogen

00:04:28.459 --> 00:04:30.059
and this right here between that.

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:32.780
And so they kind of enter
this higher energy state.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.613
And similarly, you know
these guys they say,

00:04:35.613 --> 00:04:36.992
"Hey, wouldn't it be nicer,

00:04:36.992 --> 00:04:39.968
"I don't have to be here, I
could kind of go back home

00:04:39.968 --> 00:04:43.995
"to my home atom if
this guy comes in here".

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.523
Because then we're gonna have,

00:04:45.523 --> 00:04:47.435
then we're gonna have
eight valence electrons

00:04:47.435 --> 00:04:49.070
and the same thing's happening here.

00:04:49.516 --> 00:04:51.268
And this complex right here,

00:04:51.268 --> 00:04:53.456
this kind of,

00:04:53.634 --> 00:04:55.421
right when the collision happens,

00:04:55.421 --> 00:04:57.132
this is actually a state,

00:04:57.132 --> 00:04:58.445
this is the high energy state

00:04:58.445 --> 00:05:00.140
of the transition state of the reaction,

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.489
and this is called an activated complex.

00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:05.176
Activated complex.

00:05:10.715 --> 00:05:14.108
Sometimes you know I just
drew it kind of visually,

00:05:14.108 --> 00:05:16.011
but you could draw it like this.

00:05:16.011 --> 00:05:19.175
So hydrogen has a covalent
bond with another hydrogen,

00:05:20.356 --> 00:05:23.019
and then here comes along some iodine

00:05:23.526 --> 00:05:26.480
that has a covalent bond
with some other iodine,,

00:05:26.692 --> 00:05:29.209
but all the sudden these
guys like to bond as well.

00:05:29.243 --> 00:05:30.556
So they start forming,

00:05:30.556 --> 00:05:32.875
so there is kind of a you know,

00:05:32.875 --> 00:05:35.939
there's a little bit of an
attraction on that side too.

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:38.380
So this is another way of
drawing the activation complex.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.893
But this is a high energy state,

00:05:39.893 --> 00:05:41.506
'cause in order for the electrons,

00:05:41.506 --> 00:05:42.628
the way you can think of it,

00:05:42.628 --> 00:05:44.717
to kind of go from that bond to this bond,

00:05:44.717 --> 00:05:46.590
or this bond to that bond,

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.559
or to go back,

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:50.077
they have to enter into
a higher energy state.

00:05:50.077 --> 00:05:51.916
A less stable energy state,

00:05:51.916 --> 00:05:53.263
than they were before.

00:05:53.263 --> 00:05:55.124
But they do that if there's enough energy,

00:05:55.985 --> 00:05:57.118
'cause you can go from,

00:05:57.118 --> 00:06:00.440
so you're going from both
of these things separate,

00:06:00.892 --> 00:06:02.351
let me just draw them separate,

00:06:02.644 --> 00:06:04.740
so you have both of them separate,

00:06:05.878 --> 00:06:07.279
you have the hydrogen separate,

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:09.435
plus the iodine separate.

00:06:10.286 --> 00:06:12.519
They go to this, which
is a higher energy state.

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:14.968
But if they can get to
that higher energy state,

00:06:14.968 --> 00:06:16.536
if there's enough energy for the collision

00:06:16.536 --> 00:06:19.127
and they have enough kinetic energy

00:06:19.127 --> 00:06:20.703
when they hit in the right orientation,

00:06:20.703 --> 00:06:23.757
then, from this activated complex

00:06:23.757 --> 00:06:25.053
or this higher energy state,

00:06:25.053 --> 00:06:26.885
it will then go to the
lowest energy state,

00:06:26.885 --> 00:06:28.606
and the lowest energy state is

00:06:28.606 --> 00:06:30.687
the hydrogen iodide.

00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:35.011
I wanna draw the iodide,

00:06:35.665 --> 00:06:37.043
and then the hydrogen.

00:06:39.385 --> 00:06:40.550
This is actually,

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.947
this is actually a lower
energy state than this.

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:45.159
But in order to get here

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:46.863
you have to go through
a higher energy state.

00:06:46.863 --> 00:06:48.011
And I could do that

00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:49.600
with an energy diagram.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.727
So if we say that,

00:06:50.727 --> 00:06:53.795
let's say the X-axis is the
progression of the reaction,

00:07:01.245 --> 00:07:02.189
and actually you know

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:03.672
we don't know how fast it's progressing,

00:07:03.672 --> 00:07:05.293
but this you can kind of view it as time

00:07:05.293 --> 00:07:06.822
on some dimension,

00:07:06.822 --> 00:07:09.183
and let's say this is
the potential energy.

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:11.847
I wanna draw thicker lines.

00:07:12.771 --> 00:07:14.478
See this is the potential energy.

00:07:15.626 --> 00:07:17.758
Right there, let me make
this line thicker as well.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.510
So this is the potential energy.

00:07:26.322 --> 00:07:29.161
So initially, you are at this reality,

00:07:29.161 --> 00:07:32.074
and we can kind of view it as
the combined potential energy,

00:07:32.074 --> 00:07:33.426
so this is where eventually,

00:07:33.426 --> 00:07:34.627
we start off here,

00:07:35.027 --> 00:07:39.424
and this is the H2 plus I2

00:07:40.025 --> 00:07:41.866
And a lower potential energy is

00:07:41.866 --> 00:07:43.413
when we were in the hydrogen iodide.

00:07:43.413 --> 00:07:45.793
So this is the lower
potential energy down here.

00:07:47.414 --> 00:07:49.225
Lower potential energy down here.

00:07:49.621 --> 00:07:53.781
This is the 2HI, right?

00:07:53.781 --> 00:07:54.730
But to get here,

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:56.293
we have to enter this
higher activation energy,

00:07:56.293 --> 00:07:57.557
where the electrons have to get,

00:07:57.557 --> 00:07:59.524
they have to have some
energy to kind of be able to

00:07:59.524 --> 00:08:01.692
at least figure out what they
wanna do with their lives.

00:08:02.052 --> 00:08:03.916
And so you have to add
energy to the system,

00:08:03.916 --> 00:08:05.220
you don't always have to add it,

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.261
but if it doesn't happen spontaneously

00:08:07.261 --> 00:08:09.116
you're gonna have to add
some energy to the system

00:08:10.438 --> 00:08:12.542
to get to this activated state.

00:08:16.024 --> 00:08:19.022
RIght, so this is when we
were at this thing right here.

00:08:19.976 --> 00:08:20.725
We're there.

00:08:20.725 --> 00:08:22.114
So some energy has to be in the system,

00:08:22.114 --> 00:08:23.258
and this energy,

00:08:23.258 --> 00:08:25.378
the difference between the energy we're at

00:08:25.378 --> 00:08:28.276
when we were just hydrogen
molecules and iodine molecules,

00:08:28.276 --> 00:08:29.760
and the energy we have to get to

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.369
to get this activated state,

00:08:31.369 --> 00:08:33.089
this distance right here

00:08:34.304 --> 00:08:36.417
this is the activation energy.

00:08:38.988 --> 00:08:42.069
If we're able to get to somehow put enough

00:08:42.069 --> 00:08:43.197
energy in the system,

00:08:43.197 --> 00:08:44.566
then this thing will happen,

00:08:44.566 --> 00:08:45.918
they'll collide with enough energy

00:08:45.918 --> 00:08:47.893
and bonds will be broken and reformed.

00:08:47.893 --> 00:08:49.546
Activation energy.

00:08:49.645 --> 00:08:53.345
Sometimes it's written as
Ea energy of activation,

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:55.334
and in the future we'll maybe do reactions

00:08:55.334 --> 00:08:57.101
where we actually measure
the activation energy.

00:08:57.101 --> 00:08:58.853
But the important thing is
to conceptually understand

00:08:58.853 --> 00:09:00.175
that it's there,

00:09:00.175 --> 00:09:03.496
that things just don't
spontaneously go from here to here.

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:06.044
And I won't go in deeply
into catalysts right now,

00:09:06.044 --> 00:09:07.916
but you've probably heard
of the word catalyst

00:09:07.916 --> 00:09:09.652
or something being catalyzed.

00:09:09.652 --> 00:09:10.916
And that's something,

00:09:10.916 --> 00:09:12.580
some other agent,

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.256
some other thing in the reactions.

00:09:15.462 --> 00:09:16.620
So right now,

00:09:17.296 --> 00:09:18.813
so right now we're doing,

00:09:19.843 --> 00:09:22.808
we have H2 plus I2,

00:09:23.518 --> 00:09:26.606
yielding 2H hydrogen iodides.

00:09:27.236 --> 00:09:28.708
Now you could have a catalyst,

00:09:28.708 --> 00:09:29.874
and I'll just say plus C.

00:09:30.925 --> 00:09:32.439
And I actually don't
know what a good catalyst

00:09:32.439 --> 00:09:33.811
would be for this reaction,

00:09:33.821 --> 00:09:36.882
and how a catalyst operates is,

00:09:36.882 --> 00:09:38.972
it can actually operate in
many many different ways,

00:09:38.972 --> 00:09:40.572
so that's why I don't
wanna do it in this video.

00:09:40.572 --> 00:09:43.535
But what a catalyst is, is
something that doesn't change.

00:09:43.535 --> 00:09:45.588
It doesn't get consumed in the reaction.

00:09:45.588 --> 00:09:47.348
The catalyst was there
before the reaction,

00:09:47.348 --> 00:09:49.380
the catalyst is there after the reaction.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.679
But what it does is it makes the reaction

00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:53.831
happen either faster,

00:09:53.831 --> 00:09:55.758
or it lowers the amount of energy

00:09:55.758 --> 00:09:57.039
for the reaction to happen.

00:09:57.039 --> 00:09:58.190
Which is kind of the same thing.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.303
So if you have a catalyst,

00:09:59.303 --> 00:10:01.086
then this activation energy

00:10:01.086 --> 00:10:03.075
will be lower.

00:10:03.414 --> 00:10:04.679
And what it does is, it makes it,

00:10:04.679 --> 00:10:07.238
it might easily, it might be some molecule

00:10:07.238 --> 00:10:09.137
that allows some other transition state

00:10:09.137 --> 00:10:11.097
that has less of a potential energy

00:10:11.097 --> 00:10:13.633
so that you require less heat or less

00:10:13.633 --> 00:10:15.608
concentration of the molecules

00:10:15.608 --> 00:10:17.664
for them to bump into each
other in the right direction,

00:10:17.664 --> 00:10:19.536
to get to that other state.

00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:21.253
So you require less energy.

00:10:21.697 --> 00:10:23.481
So given how we understand

00:10:24.281 --> 00:10:25.968
how these kinetics occur,

00:10:25.968 --> 00:10:28.171
these molecules interact with each other,

00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:30.000
what do you think are the things that

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.339
will drive whether a
reaction happens or not?

00:10:33.558 --> 00:10:35.544
I mean we already know that if
we have a positive catalyst,

00:10:35.544 --> 00:10:37.474
there's something called
a negative catalyst that

00:10:37.474 --> 00:10:39.030
will actually slow down a reaction.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:40.886
But if we have a positive catalyst,

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:42.636
it lowers...

00:10:45.002 --> 00:10:46.843
Obviously it lowers the activation energy,

00:10:46.843 --> 00:10:50.176
so this makes reaction faster.

00:10:54.631 --> 00:10:57.572
More molecules are gonna bump
into each other just right

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.056
to be able to get over this hump

00:10:59.056 --> 00:11:00.464
'cause the hump will be lower,

00:11:00.464 --> 00:11:01.485
when you have a catalyst.

00:11:01.485 --> 00:11:03.493
Also if you increase the concentration.

00:11:04.016 --> 00:11:06.895
Right? If you increase your concentration,

00:11:07.635 --> 00:11:08.893
of molecules,

00:11:09.449 --> 00:11:10.550
if the concentration goes up,

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:12.755
then you just have more stuff
to bump into each other.

00:11:13.551 --> 00:11:14.383
Right?

00:11:14.383 --> 00:11:15.319
There's just the likelihood.

00:11:15.319 --> 00:11:16.503
Everything is probabilistic.

00:11:16.503 --> 00:11:19.328
You know when people write
these reaction equations,

00:11:19.328 --> 00:11:22.455
it all seems nice and simple
and very clear and it happens.

00:11:22.455 --> 00:11:24.357
But no, in the real world,

00:11:24.357 --> 00:11:26.527
you just have things
bumping into each other.

00:11:26.527 --> 00:11:28.454
And when we do biology videos

00:11:28.454 --> 00:11:29.742
it'll be fascinating to talk about.

00:11:29.742 --> 00:11:32.144
Because all of, every
biological process is

00:11:32.144 --> 00:11:33.664
really just a chemical process.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.734
And it's really just a byproduct of

00:11:35.734 --> 00:11:38.474
all of these things
bumping into each other.

00:11:38.742 --> 00:11:40.869
And you can imagine the
more concentration you have

00:11:40.869 --> 00:11:42.805
of the things that need
to bump into each other,

00:11:42.805 --> 00:11:44.141
the more likely you're gonna get

00:11:44.141 --> 00:11:45.714
just that perfect bump,

00:11:45.714 --> 00:11:47.317
and that perfect amount of kinetic energy

00:11:47.317 --> 00:11:48.782
for the reaction to happen.

00:11:49.447 --> 00:11:51.552
And actually I'll make a
little other note here.

00:11:51.552 --> 00:11:53.795
This reaction you might
say, "Okay I have some,

00:11:53.795 --> 00:11:55.302
"let's say I'm at this energy,

00:11:55.302 --> 00:11:56.588
"how do I ever get over this?

00:11:56.588 --> 00:11:57.885
"How does this ever react?".

00:11:57.885 --> 00:11:59.965
Well remember, in a gas,

00:11:59.965 --> 00:12:01.862
the kinetic energies of
all of the molecules,

00:12:01.862 --> 00:12:02.988
they're not uniform.

00:12:02.988 --> 00:12:04.568
Some gases have,

00:12:04.568 --> 00:12:06.431
some molecules will have
higher kinetic energy,

00:12:06.431 --> 00:12:07.128
some will have lower,

00:12:07.128 --> 00:12:08.627
temperature just gives you the average.

00:12:08.627 --> 00:12:11.224
So there's always some
probability that two

00:12:11.224 --> 00:12:13.166
maybe high kinetic energy molecules

00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:15.702
will bump into each other just perfectly,

00:12:16.132 --> 00:12:17.281
surpass the kinetic--

00:12:17.281 --> 00:12:18.609
So they have enough kinetic energy

00:12:18.609 --> 00:12:20.284
to get into the activation state,

00:12:20.284 --> 00:12:22.240
and then they can go to the lower state,

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.717
which is the hydrogen iodide.

00:12:23.841 --> 00:12:24.817
So even at a,

00:12:24.817 --> 00:12:26.724
at all temperatures this will occur,

00:12:26.724 --> 00:12:28.577
but obviously if you
increase the temperature,

00:12:28.577 --> 00:12:29.959
if you increase the temperature

00:12:29.959 --> 00:12:31.685
that reaction is more likely.

00:12:32.129 --> 00:12:33.016
So that's the other one.

00:12:33.016 --> 00:12:34.121
So temperature.

00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:35.600
Temperature is actually
probably the biggest.

00:12:36.753 --> 00:12:39.292
Temperature is probably
the single biggest thing

00:12:39.292 --> 00:12:42.159
that will make the reaction happen faster.

00:12:43.707 --> 00:12:44.644
So all of these things,

00:12:44.644 --> 00:12:45.876
you want higher temperature,

00:12:45.876 --> 00:12:47.146
higher reaction.

00:12:47.650 --> 00:12:48.640
And then if you just wanna think about

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.114
the molecules itself,

00:12:50.114 --> 00:12:52.497
if you have molecules where

00:12:52.497 --> 00:12:54.728
their original bonds are weak,

00:12:55.497 --> 00:12:57.098
they're more likely to
be able to interact.

00:12:57.098 --> 00:12:58.497
And there's other things
you could talk about,

00:12:58.497 --> 00:12:59.618
the molecular shape,

00:12:59.618 --> 00:13:01.417
how available certain atoms are

00:13:01.417 --> 00:13:02.740
to interact with other atoms,

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.050
and that really becomes significant

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:05.857
when we start going into biology.

00:13:05.857 --> 00:13:08.169
And then the last one, and
you probably realize this,

00:13:08.169 --> 00:13:09.853
is just the surface area.

00:13:10.852 --> 00:13:12.552
If you increase the surface area,

00:13:12.552 --> 00:13:15.186
so we were just doing
gas-gas interactions,

00:13:15.186 --> 00:13:16.849
which almost by definition have

00:13:16.849 --> 00:13:18.383
pretty good surface area interactions.

00:13:18.383 --> 00:13:19.839
But if the surface area goes up,

00:13:19.839 --> 00:13:21.887
then the reaction also goes up.

00:13:21.887 --> 00:13:23.175
The reaction rate.

00:13:24.328 --> 00:13:25.364
And how do you think about that?

00:13:25.364 --> 00:13:26.852
Well, think about the reaction of,

00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:29.406
think about the reaction
of, you know we've done this

00:13:29.406 --> 00:13:30.455
multiple times.

00:13:30.455 --> 00:13:32.347
Sodium chloride,

00:13:33.408 --> 00:13:35.475
solid, so solid salt,

00:13:35.895 --> 00:13:38.226
plus liquid water,

00:13:40.293 --> 00:13:41.443
leads to

00:13:41.894 --> 00:13:44.773
sodium, well we could think
of it a lot of different ways,

00:13:44.998 --> 00:13:48.970
but we could think of it
as sodium ion aqueous,

00:13:50.343 --> 00:13:53.610
plus chloride anions,
there's a cation anion,

00:13:54.007 --> 00:13:55.298
aqueous.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.611
So it gets dissolved.

00:13:56.611 --> 00:13:57.677
And how does that happen?

00:13:57.677 --> 00:13:59.312
If you have a big block of ice,

00:13:59.312 --> 00:14:00.481
not of ice, of salt.

00:14:01.696 --> 00:14:03.443
You have a big, I'll do salt in grey.

00:14:03.443 --> 00:14:05.943
If you have a big block of salt in there,

00:14:06.573 --> 00:14:08.541
and you have, so there's a bunch of

00:14:08.541 --> 00:14:10.194
sodium and chloride

00:14:10.978 --> 00:14:13.126
atoms in it.

00:14:13.623 --> 00:14:15.341
And you have water all around it,

00:14:17.202 --> 00:14:18.957
the water is only gonna
be able to interact

00:14:18.957 --> 00:14:20.325
with the surface molecules,

00:14:20.325 --> 00:14:22.169
and slowly dissolve away the salt.

00:14:22.297 --> 00:14:24.718
Slowly make polar bonds.

00:14:24.718 --> 00:14:26.101
These are actually,

00:14:26.101 --> 00:14:28.981
well, polar dipole bonds with a different,

00:14:29.488 --> 00:14:32.457
the different sodium or chloride ions.

00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:35.643
But if you were to break
this up into smaller cubes,

00:14:37.021 --> 00:14:38.225
if you were to break it up or really

00:14:38.225 --> 00:14:40.234
crush it into really small pieces,

00:14:41.446 --> 00:14:43.197
then all of the sudden the surface area

00:14:43.197 --> 00:14:45.429
that the water molecules
can interact with,

00:14:45.429 --> 00:14:48.185
it can actually interact with
more of the sodium chloride.

00:14:48.185 --> 00:14:49.984
So the reaction will happen faster.

00:14:49.984 --> 00:14:50.864
So surface area,

00:14:50.864 --> 00:14:52.375
you increase the surface
area of interaction,

00:14:52.375 --> 00:14:54.119
and you'll also increase
the reaction rate.

00:14:54.119 --> 00:14:56.417
If you're trying to do it with two fluids,

00:14:56.417 --> 00:14:58.242
what you could do is you could kind of

00:14:58.242 --> 00:14:59.688
spray one fluid into the other,

00:14:59.688 --> 00:15:00.703
so you have little droplets

00:15:00.703 --> 00:15:02.403
so you also increase the surface area.

00:15:02.646 --> 00:15:03.366
So anyway,

00:15:03.366 --> 00:15:05.819
this is kind of an introduction
to the idea of kinetics.

00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:08.326
But hopefully gives you a
sense that these reactions,

00:15:08.326 --> 00:15:10.383
and I want you to really think
about chemistry this way,

00:15:10.383 --> 00:15:11.528
not think about it as,

00:15:11.528 --> 00:15:13.045
"Oh it's just some formula
I have to remember".

00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:16.252
That that these really are
bumps and bruises between atoms,

00:15:16.252 --> 00:15:18.306
that it's probabilistic and it's messy

00:15:18.306 --> 00:15:19.994
and we really have to think about

00:15:19.994 --> 00:15:22.939
what will make it more likely
that these things collide

00:15:22.939 --> 00:15:25.734
in just the perfect way for
the reactions to happen.
