[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:07.968
JIMMY CHIN: Cool.

00:00:11.454 --> 00:00:16.079
JONATHAN DIBLASI: So
we're chatting earlier--

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:19.190
so I want to start from
the beginning of where

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.180
"Free Solo" [DING] kind
of came to be, right?

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.430
I wanted to see-- oh, man, I
didn't mute my own phone, here.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.180
AUDIENCE: [GROANS]

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.120
JONATHAN DIBLASI: So where did
the beginning of "Free Solo"

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.620
start?

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.319
Tell us kind of the story
that actually set in project--

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:35.360
into motion, the project.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.984
JIMMY CHIN: Sure,
well, first of all, I

00:00:36.984 --> 00:00:39.290
just wanted to say thank
you again for coming out.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.140
And it means a lot
to see everybody

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.770
here and so enthusiastic.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.730
I didn't necessarily make films
because I think about who's

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.560
going to see them so much.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:59.120
But to see you all here is very
heartwarming, so thank you.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.700
I did want to ask real
quickly, how many people

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.072
here have seen "Free Solo"?

00:01:04.072 --> 00:01:08.060
Hm, OK, that's
pretty good, yeah.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.950
Oh, some people
twice, that's great.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.480
Awesome, well, yeah, so
this project, or the film,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.020
I guess, to give
everybody some context,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.870
was originally an idea that
I came up with about three,

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.000
four years ago after a
film I made called "Meru."

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.860
And just out of curiosity, how
many people here seem "Meru"?

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.350
Oh, that's pretty good, too.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.640
OK, so it was really just a
character portrait of Alex.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.670
And, really, his
accomplishments even before he

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.110
free-soloed El Cap were
already easily worthy

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.940
of making a film about.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.600
And really, Alex as
a character is always

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.710
very interesting to me, because
I've been filming and shooting

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.720
in the mountain world and
kind of in the vertical space

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.000
and Yosemite for 20 years, and
also outside of that in the ski

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.060
and snowboard world,
base-jumping--

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.390
a lot of the different,
what people call,

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.040
extreme or adventure sports.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.270
And many of the top
athletes at the top

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.930
of their careers over
the last 20 years,

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.240
so I've seen a lot of
different incredible athletes.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.000
And Alex's was just
an anomaly, really,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.240
among a peer group of anomalies.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.450
And he really, really stood out
in the sense that what he did

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.780
was almost like he
had a superpower.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.605
There are athletic feats that
are due to talent and training

00:02:54.605 --> 00:02:58.100
and discipline and
people might be

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.360
predisposed to excel in that
particular respect of sport.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.260
But what Alex was able
to do mentally just

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.762
seems not from this world.

00:03:09.762 --> 00:03:10.720
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Yeah.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.730
JIMMY CHIN: And
so I really wanted

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.670
to examine his
motivations and take

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.040
a deep dive in as a character.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.250
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Yeah.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.250
JIMMY CHIN: We didn't talk
about making it about El Cap.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.520
Alex came to us with El Cap.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.270
And my wife and
directing partner, Chai,

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.580
was, essentially,
hanging out with Alex

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.900
because I knew him very well.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.374
I'd been traveling and
climbing with him for 10 years.

00:03:40.374 --> 00:03:41.790
But she didn't
know him very well.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.320
So she kind of was
just meeting with him

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.020
to get a sense of his
character and if he'd

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.020
be a good subject for
a future documentary.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.640
And he told her-- he's
like, oh, that's--

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.390
I'm interested in
making a documentary.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.650
That'd be great because I'm
thinking about free-soloing El

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.756
Cap.

00:04:00.756 --> 00:04:01.780
And my wife--

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.630
JONATHAN DIBLASI: So
casual, not a big deal.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.330
JIMMY CHIN: --is not a climber.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:11.810
And she's from Manhattan
and she's like, oh, yeah,

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:12.610
that sounds great.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.300
We really have something
to anchor the film,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.149
and all this stuff.

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:22.460
So I called her that evening.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.990
I was out on a shoot somewhere.

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.050
And I was like, how did your
conversations with Alex go?

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.800
What do you think?

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.130
She's like, he's a very
interesting character.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.368
And it's great, he's going
to go free-solo El Cap.

00:04:35.368 --> 00:04:37.540
And I almost fell
out of my chair

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.690
because I was like,
he said, what?

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.320
And he'd never spoken
to his friends about it.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.830
And we were-- we didn't even
really talk about it amongst

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.870
ourselves, just because
it seemed like--

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.870
we didn't even want to
put it into the ether.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.430
Because we could kind of tell
that everything he was doing

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.210
was leading to--

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.170
I mean, he'd basically
free soloed everything else

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:11.700
that was of significance,
except for El Cap.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.682
So it's kind of out
there and we didn't even

00:05:14.682 --> 00:05:15.890
really want to talk about it.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:19.770
But so then when he
presented it to us,

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.270
we actually had to
take six months off.

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.500
We stepped away from
the film because we

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.720
weren't sure we wanted
to make that film.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.440
JONATHAN DIBLASI:
Yeah, maybe you

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.023
can talk about that a little bit
more during those six months.

00:05:31.023 --> 00:05:33.372
I mean, is some of that
the moral side of it?

00:05:33.372 --> 00:05:34.080
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.530
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Should
we really film him?

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.520
Maybe talk a little
bit about that.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.853
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah, I can do that.

00:05:37.853 --> 00:05:41.160
So for those of you who've seen
it, part of the film kind of

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.930
tries to tackle
the ethical issues

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.640
around the making of the film.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.370
And it's really, in
some ways, a dilemma

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.340
that documentary
filmmakers kind of

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.800
have to address no matter what.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:02.370
It's if we are supposed to be
these objective observers when

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.280
we bring a camera
into a situation,

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.410
it necessarily changes
what you're observing.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.930
And I think it's called
the Hawthorne Effect--

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.290
by observing something
you change the dynamic

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.840
within what you're observing.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.700
So in this case, the issue
is a little more serious

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:31.410
because we were worried that
we could potentially either

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:35.180
push him into doing something
he wouldn't normally have done,

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.230
as some of us called
"Kodak courage."

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:39.450
Like, oh, someone's
got a camera.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.851
I'm going to jump off this cliff
into water that's too shallow,

00:06:42.851 --> 00:06:43.350
or whatever.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:43.850
I mean--

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.840
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Yeah.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.010
JIMMY CHIN: Or in an
even worst case scenario,

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.870
while we're filming
something would

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:53.655
happen in which we
ended up killing him.

00:06:53.655 --> 00:06:54.530
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Hm.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.760
JIMMY CHIN: And
so that obviously

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.270
took some time to
digest and we really

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.920
had to look at a
few big questions.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.740
And I talked to a
lot of my mentors,

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.690
in particular, Jon Krakauer.

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:15.640
The author is a good friend
of mine, someone I look up to.

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.690
And he has a very good
perspective on life.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:20.960
So I asked Jon about
it and he said, look,

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.430
is he going to do this
even if you don't film it?

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:28.520
And I said, yes, he very
likely will try to do this

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.390
even if we're not there.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.830
And he said, do you think
this is an important moment?

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.100
Should it be documented
if he does do it?

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.025
And of course, as a
filmmaker, we're--

00:07:41.025 --> 00:07:42.660
I said, yes.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.620
And it also came down to do you
feel like you're in the best

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:49.350
position to do it safely?

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:50.810
Because if someone else--

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.710
do you feel like--

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.200
yeah, if you feel like
you're the best to do it.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.950
And you're just spending
10 years with him

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.230
and really getting to
know him and having

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:06.330
a really good working
relationship and trust

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.795
between each other.

00:08:07.795 --> 00:08:10.620
I know his
decision-making process.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.640
I understand his
process in general

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:15.930
when it comes to free-soloing.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.490
He's very methodical.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:21.570
He's not-- people always
assume he's a daredevil,

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:25.690
like he is just
pulling off a stunt.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.790
That, to him, is
totally unacceptable.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.230
To him, it's a craft.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:37.159
It's something that deserves
the attention and kind

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:42.590
of discipline of
craftsmanship, like a fine,

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:43.520
fine, craftsmanship.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:49.660
And I know that he doesn't
climb for the camera.

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.610
And you certainly
don't become a climber

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.335
for the money and the fame.

00:08:53.335 --> 00:08:55.510
JONATHAN DIBLASI: [LAUGHS] Yes.

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:58.250
JIMMY CHIN: You climb
because you love it.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:04.330
And I know that he doesn't
care about being famous at all.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:09.050
I mean, he just he just wants
to climb and do his thing.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:11.830
And so having that
kind of pure intention

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:13.222
is also really important.

00:09:13.222 --> 00:09:14.680
JONATHAN DIBLASI:
No, that's great.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.280
So obviously, last 30
minutes of the film,

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.950
it's him actually climbing,
right, going up the route?

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.530
You're following along with him.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.420
And when I first watched it--

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.910
probably most people--
you know that he makes it.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:28.994
That's not a surprise.

00:09:28.994 --> 00:09:31.660
It'd probably be terrible if you
didn't know that going into it,

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.160
right?

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.910
JIMMY CHIN: No, you know what?

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.900
I've heard that
people-- there are

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.670
people that have gone into
this film not knowing.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.867
And I'm like, that
would be horrible.

00:09:42.867 --> 00:09:46.050
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Yeah,
yeah, but so with that,

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.635
I think that takes a very--

00:09:49.635 --> 00:09:53.040
a certain touch on the
editing and filming process

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.520
to still be able to build that
tension and excitement of--

00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.179
we know the outcome, but my
hands are still sweating.

00:09:59.179 --> 00:10:00.720
I still feel like
I want to throw up.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.570
Maybe talk about the actual
post-production and filming

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:04.360
side of it.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.080
What went into setting
it up to be what it is?

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:10.770
JIMMY CHIN: So I think
a couple of things--

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:14.700
I mean, we went into the film
knowing that we wanted to make

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:19.580
a vérité film, just to bring
people into the moment.

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:22.117
The scenes aren't constructed.

00:10:22.117 --> 00:10:24.450
Vérité filmmaking is really
challenging because you have

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:27.000
to really spend so
much time filming,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.987
and you're there constantly, to
the point where your subjects

00:10:30.987 --> 00:10:32.945
eventually just kind of
surrender to the camera

00:10:32.945 --> 00:10:34.111
and they don't care anymore.

00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:35.850
You just kind of
disappear, and that's

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.390
kind of the best case scenario.

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.610
But you film with
someone for two years,

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:45.841
so you're just kind of
compiling these moments.

00:10:45.841 --> 00:10:47.340
And the reason I'm
talking about it,

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.131
because it does come
back to your question,

00:10:49.131 --> 00:10:53.550
is that in that
kind of filmmaking,

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:57.300
you're really trying to connect
people with your subject.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.960
I mean, films, really, for me,
are about creating empathy.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.500
And it's also about
transporting people into a world

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.640
that they might not know of.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:13.660
In some cases, it allows
clarity on misperceptions

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.462
of a subject or a topic.

00:11:16.462 --> 00:11:18.170
So these are all things
that we hope for,

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.492
but ultimately,
your hands aren't

00:11:22.492 --> 00:11:23.950
going to sweat as
much if you don't

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:25.550
care about your character.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:31.060
And so really, making the
film, a cinema vérité film,

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:36.880
was to get people to really
empathize with this character

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:37.690
who--

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:48.520
Alex is this-- essentially, he
was this very shy, scared kid

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:53.530
who was more scared to talk,
to ask for a climbing partner,

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.435
than he was to go free-soloing.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.420
And that always struck
Chai and I about his story.

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.480
It's not like he
doesn't feel fear

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.410
and it's not like he's
completely unemotive.

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:12.200
Like inside somewhere in this
person is the same beating

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.290
heart we all have and has
the same kind of fears

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:18.650
and challenges that we
all face in our lives.

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:21.980
And I thought that
really getting people

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:25.700
to understand that he didn't
just become this superhero that

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.920
could free-solo El Cap.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:33.830
He worked through all of
these fears methodically.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.060
I mean, for those of you
that have seen the film,

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.000
there's this part
where he's like, I was

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.740
scared of different vegetables.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.330
I didn't want to
eat them, but then I

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:46.400
made myself systematically
eat every vegetable

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.340
until I could eat vegetables.

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.160
He says, I didn't know
how to hug people.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.020
I was 23 or 24 and
nobody ever hugged me.

00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:02.420
But it seemed like people
enjoy hugging each other,

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:07.180
so I decided to go out and
figure out how to hug people.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.930
And I was there for a
lot of that process.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.790
I met him in his
early 20s and he

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.940
used to come up and be like--

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.120
and you'd feel his fingers
in the middle of your back,

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:19.470
just tapping you.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.600
And you'd be like, Alex,
Alex, no, no, no, you

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.660
got to bring it in.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.390
You got to-- [GRUNTS] like
heart to heart, double-hand,

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:27.970
like [SOUND EFFECT].

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.290
And he's just--

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:33.430
I think it's, really,
a beautiful story

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.350
about this person evolving.

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.390
And then he meets
Sanni, of course,

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:40.940
and falls in love while we're in
the middle of this production,

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:41.900
so--

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.816
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Yeah,
I mean, the whole film

00:13:43.816 --> 00:13:47.620
feels so intimate as you're
watching him and Sanni as she's

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:48.850
leaving for that last time.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:49.690
She's crying in the car.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:50.060
I mean--

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:50.230
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.185
JONATHAN DIBLASI: --when
I was thinking about that,

00:13:51.185 --> 00:13:52.450
I was like, man, that
would be terrible.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.260
Is that the last time you're
ever going to hug him?

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:54.505
Like that--

00:13:54.505 --> 00:13:56.838
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah, I mean,
those are heavy conversations.

00:13:56.838 --> 00:14:01.780
When people are talking
about someone that they love

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.910
and maybe not ever
seeing them again.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.470
And those are very
real conversations

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:09.770
that were captured.

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:13.570
But again, back to
your original question,

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:18.990
it really was about building
this connection with Alex

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:22.420
so that when he got there--
and then, of course,

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.919
we built up the climb,
all the kind of sections

00:14:25.919 --> 00:14:27.960
of the climb that are
important in the narrative,

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.582
like the free blast and
the boulder problem.

00:14:30.582 --> 00:14:33.770
If you've all-- for the people
that have seen the film,

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:37.140
I mean, everybody
knows that there's

00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:41.730
a thumb-hold on the boulder
problem that's very scary.

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.700
But you have to kind of give
that a certain treatment,

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:45.330
as well, to--

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.550
JONATHAN DIBLASI:
Yeah, so as I said,

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:51.070
very intimate experience for
the viewers and for the crew.

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:53.920
And also I think an
intimate experience for you

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:56.400
and Chai with free-soloing.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:57.419
So maybe prior--

00:14:57.419 --> 00:14:59.460
I think you maybe have
free-soloed before, right?

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:00.510
You've free-soled some things?

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:01.218
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah.

00:15:01.218 --> 00:15:03.500
JONATHAN DIBLASI: After
filming this project,

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.925
how has your views on free
solo maybe evolved or changed,

00:15:06.925 --> 00:15:07.800
or are they the same?

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:10.620
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah,
so I guess really

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.812
it's about what are
my views on risk--

00:15:12.812 --> 00:15:13.770
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Yeah.

00:15:13.770 --> 00:15:15.920
JIMMY CHIN: Ultimately--

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:21.960
I have two small
children, two and five.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.882
Very cute, even though
they jump up on my--

00:15:25.882 --> 00:15:27.840
jump up and down on my
head in the morning when

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.840
I haven't had any sleep.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:36.540
But they-- really, the film
didn't necessarily make

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:41.400
me change my evaluation or
assessment of risk for myself,

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.480
or my crew.

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:49.746
I think that happened years
ago before I had children.

00:15:49.746 --> 00:15:51.120
Because a lot of
people say, does

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:54.660
having children change
your outlook on risk?

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.120
And really, I think
I had my change--

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:02.370
my outlook on risk change in
order for me to have children.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:06.905
So I feel like I'm
pretty conservative,

00:16:06.905 --> 00:16:09.030
even though most people
look at what I do and think

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:12.590
it's not conservative.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:15.020
But I also think risk
is a relative thing.

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:21.950
So you know what might look
very, very scary to someone,

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:23.420
to me--

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:26.250
if I'm doing something, it could
look very scary to someone.

00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:31.810
But for me, it feels
very in control and easy.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:33.106
So--

00:16:33.106 --> 00:16:35.845
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Yeah, so
there's a scene in the movie,

00:16:35.845 --> 00:16:37.220
it's like two
minutes long, where

00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:39.159
Alex is talking
through each pitch,

00:16:39.159 --> 00:16:41.075
kind of shows him training
as he's practicing.

00:16:41.075 --> 00:16:44.570
He's like, pitch one, talking
about the free blast slap,

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:45.590
going all the way up.

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:46.961
So he has it memorized, right?

00:16:46.961 --> 00:16:48.710
He has it written down,
every single move,

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:51.350
every single thumb-hold
that he has to do.

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.360
And you also hint
at a little bit

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.670
in the film around
the performance

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.000
that yourself and the
film crew had to put in.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.700
So I'm curious if you
can share what did--

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:03.280
what was your version of that?

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:03.850
Were you--

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:08.109
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah, yeah,
well, first of all, Alex

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:12.240
not only knew all
the moves perfectly,

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:17.560
on a lot of sections, he would
purposely do them incorrectly

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.960
so that if he ever
did make a mistake,

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.190
it would feel at least familiar.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:27.310
So that's how detailed
he went into it.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:32.320
He wore the same clothing the
entire time we were filming.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.290
You would think it was because
of continuity, as a filmmaker,

00:17:35.290 --> 00:17:38.500
but it is really because
he knew that that's

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.370
what he was going to wear the
day he was going to solo it,

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:48.091
and so he never wanted to have
to deal with that variable of,

00:17:48.091 --> 00:17:49.840
well, waking up in the
morning being like,

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.320
do I want to wear the green
shirt or the red shirt?

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.170
Or on the climb, he'd be
very familiar with what

00:17:56.170 --> 00:18:01.870
he's wearing, so he really loved
to reduce any sort of variables

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:04.060
on any sort of level.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:09.670
But in terms of our crew,
the first criteria on this,

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.230
to be on the
high-angle team, was

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:15.070
that you had to be an
elite professional climber.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:20.104
And just the kind
of volume of work

00:18:20.104 --> 00:18:22.270
that we were going to be
doing in high-angle terrain

00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:25.110
meant that I just
couldn't ever have

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:28.310
to worry about them making
bad decisions up there.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:32.050
And so the other
criteria of course,

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:34.530
they had to be great
cinematographers,

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.740
meaning there's, like,
three people in the world

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:41.100
that I could call, all of
which I've known and worked

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:43.500
with for many years, as well.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.720
They're kind of
like my crack team

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.740
that I go to if we have a
really heavy high-stakes shoot.

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.060
I'm sure when they see my
name come up on their phone,

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.414
they're like, oh, boy.

00:18:55.414 --> 00:18:56.580
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Not again.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:57.130
JIMMY CHIN: 'Cause we've done--

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.020
we've been all over the place.

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:05.250
But they are, in a lot
of ways, like Alex.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.400
In the kind of upper
echelon of climbing,

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.000
it's all about the details.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.890
It's all about
anticipating problems.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:17.340
It's all about making
hard decisions when

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:20.010
the stakes are high,
and staying very calm

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:22.780
when things are very tenuous.

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:28.830
So the team, the makeup of
the team is hugely critical.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:33.750
And they also were Alex's
friends, so that it had these--

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:37.560
there's an emotional layer to
it that it was also challenging,

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:38.820
as well as a technical layer.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.470
The technical layer
obviously being

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:43.960
that we had to move very
quickly all the time.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.040
They were professional climbers
meaning that not only were they

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:49.800
very fast, but
we've all spent time

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.320
on both sides of the camera,
so we're very sensitive

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.440
of what it feels like when
someone else is filming you,

00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:01.860
how that works, and what we hate
about bad, slow camera teams.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.130
So we were always
fast and on time

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:07.170
and never had to have him wait.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:09.000
It always felt very
natural for him

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.900
whenever he was moving
because we know what it's

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:15.890
like to be on the other side.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:18.680
And essentially, he
practiced for two years

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.380
to climb the route
and we spent two years

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.030
practicing shooting the climb.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:26.930
So by the time he went
for it, our choreography

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:30.247
for how we were going to shoot
it was pinned down and tight.

00:20:30.247 --> 00:20:31.830
JONATHAN DIBLASI:
Yeah, there's a part

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.990
where he's talking about
the boulder problem,

00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:34.922
he says, autopilot.

00:20:34.922 --> 00:20:35.630
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah.

00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:36.060
JONATHAN DIBLASI:
And that was probably

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:36.990
the same thing for you guys.

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:38.656
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah, it
was the same for us

00:20:38.656 --> 00:20:42.210
because you can't let your
mind wander into the what-ifs.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.710
There's so much to think about.

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.800
You've got all your climbing
equipment and safety systems

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.280
and you're changing
lenses on the wall.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.005
You're pulling focus.

00:20:52.005 --> 00:20:53.470
You're double-checking
batteries.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.100
You got to-- I mean--

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.380
and you're coiling all
these ropes, right?

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.480
So when you're
filming climbing, you

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.150
can't have ropes in
your frame, which

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:07.780
means that as he's climbing
up and you're moving up,

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.110
you're hauling ropes.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:12.810
So if you start filming
1,500 feet down the wall,

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:18.830
and you're moving with him and
he climbs up that 1,500 feet,

00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:21.470
well, you're carrying
1,500 feet of rope

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:23.570
by the time you get
to the top of that,

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.910
which is a lot of weight.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:31.080
And so everything has to
be clipped off carefully,

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.810
because if one end of the
rope starts to unravel,

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:36.570
the whole thing can
shoot down the wall

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.370
and potentially knock off Alex.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.890
So there's just tons of
stuff to think about.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:44.620
And the directive was that you
just stay focused on your job.

00:21:44.620 --> 00:21:48.300
Don't let your mind wander.

00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:54.490
Don't forget to press record,
which totally happens,

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.100
it totally happens.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.050
And so that was kind
of the technical side.

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.930
But the emotional
side was that we

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:04.840
had to be totally
neutral around Alex

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:10.080
because you couldn't be
encouraging or discouraging.

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.480
We were we had an
obligation as a filmmaker

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:17.460
to kind of maintain a
neutral space for him,

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.250
but still be his friend.

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:21.270
JONATHAN DIBLASI:
Yeah, so there's

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:24.420
also a part as he's preparing to
actually do the final one where

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:26.976
he succeeds in doing it,
where you're talking through

00:22:26.976 --> 00:22:28.600
if something goes
wrong, what do we do?

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:30.360
And someone says,
just call 9-1-1.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.770
Tell them what you know--

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.120
climber.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:35.190
Did you have
discussions as a team,

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.080
or between Chai and
yourself, or with Alex--

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.870
and this maybe is
pretty morbid, but I'm

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:42.665
sure people are wondering--
if he had fallen, was it,

00:22:42.665 --> 00:22:44.040
we're going to
scrap the project,

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:45.665
never release this,
never tell anybody.

00:22:45.665 --> 00:22:46.905
Or is it, we tell the story?

00:22:46.905 --> 00:22:49.980
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah, no, I mean we
had to address this before we

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:52.180
launched into production.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.410
So these conversations were
happening three years ago.

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:59.400
What happens in the
worst case scenario?

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.130
We didn't necessarily
have a clear answer,

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:03.270
but we've addressed it.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.820
And then the issue is
that you can't really

00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:11.070
know what you're going to do
in regards to this situation

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:12.510
until you're in it.

00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:14.670
Because I think
there'll be a lot

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:19.170
of inputs that tell you whether
or not it's appropriate or not.

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:23.880
And it's very sensitive to
a lot of different people,

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.030
stakeholders like his family.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:31.200
And Alex would just be like, oh,
you guys, should just make it.

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:37.470
Because you would have
wasted all this time shooting

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:39.720
and there wouldn't be--
you might as well make--

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:42.030
I mean, he's very practical.

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.270
I think people who have
seen the film understand

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:47.040
he's very practical, pragmatic.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:52.540
So I think it would have been
a very difficult film to make.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.020
But we would have
probably made it,

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:59.790
and I certainly wouldn't trust
anybody else with the material.

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:03.270
But that being said,
we never anticipated--

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:06.330
if we had anticipated
that he was going to fall,

00:24:06.330 --> 00:24:09.630
we would certainly never
have been in the project.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:12.810
The whole idea was
that we trusted

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:17.160
that he would either turn
around or decide not to do it

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:22.290
before he would ever go up
there and try to force himself

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.090
to do it and fall off.

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.350
If I ever felt like
that was the case,

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:30.120
I would have run away
from the project, yeah.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.460
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Yeah,
so your other projects

00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.710
like "Meru," the other
things that you've worked on,

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:37.620
I feel like the risks are
obviously still there--

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:39.810
no oxygen, very cold.

00:24:39.810 --> 00:24:42.990
But it feels potentially
less immediate

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:45.150
than something like an
incident with free-soloing.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:45.425
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah.

00:24:45.425 --> 00:24:47.400
JONATHAN DIBLASI: And
I think the motivation

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.520
behind a film and
the people in "Meru,"

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.550
climbing that, it seems
different than Alex's

00:24:53.550 --> 00:24:55.372
motivation.

00:24:55.372 --> 00:24:57.330
Or is it the same-- maybe
you can go into that?

00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:00.180
JIMMY CHIN: I mean, I
think there are certainly

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:08.860
similarities in the sense
that these are both--

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:11.900
like free-soloing and alpine
climbing in the mountains,

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:15.820
at altitude, in the cold--

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:19.390
they're just not what most
people kind of imagine

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:23.230
being really fun, something that
you'd really want to pursue,

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:25.710
spend your life doing.

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:34.100
But sometimes you don't get to
choose what your passion is.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.600
Sometimes it chooses you.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:44.390
And if you're lucky, then maybe
you are a doctor or a lawyer,

00:25:44.390 --> 00:25:47.170
or I don't know-- a hedge
fund manager, I don't know--

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:49.610
certainly not a climber.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.489
But well, not certainly--

00:25:52.489 --> 00:25:53.780
I have other opinions about it.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:59.000
But it's when you find
something that gives you

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:07.040
meaning and purpose and it's
something that moves you

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.620
and there's nothing
else that can really

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:16.590
feed that like climbing
can, then in that sense,

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:18.310
they're very similar.

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:23.730
They're just what you love and
what you get meaning out of.

00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:28.640
So to what degree should
we be pursuing that?

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.200
I mean, that's
probably up for debate.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:35.550
But it is deeply satisfying.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:42.450
And we call it conquistadors
of the useless--

00:26:42.450 --> 00:26:46.540
you're chasing this thing
that probably doesn't

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.040
do that much for the world.

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:53.940
But it is about the pursuit
of perfection and excellence

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:58.750
and dreaming outside of
what you think is possible,

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:01.960
and really pushing yourself
in ways that you might have

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.522
been afraid of doing before.

00:27:03.522 --> 00:27:04.480
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Yeah.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:06.688
JIMMY CHIN: So it's a lot
about exploration, as well.

00:27:06.688 --> 00:27:08.650
JONATHAN DIBLASI:
Yeah, and there's--

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:12.940
when Alex first tries and on the
free blast slab, he bails out.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:18.160
After he's talking to Peter
Croft, and he's like, I bailed.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.160
Peter's like, no, it's the
best thing you could have done.

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.080
But you can tell
on Alex's face he's

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:24.670
so disappointed in himself.

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.170
And he says, it sucks.

00:27:26.170 --> 00:27:27.872
I just need it to end.

00:27:27.872 --> 00:27:28.580
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah.

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.220
JONATHAN DIBLASI:
Like it's this goal

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:33.490
that he feels like
he can attain,

00:27:33.490 --> 00:27:34.804
but it's still so far away.

00:27:34.804 --> 00:27:36.970
And it's still like a year
until he actually did it.

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:37.850
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah.

00:27:37.850 --> 00:27:38.800
JONATHAN DIBLASI: And
is that something that

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.270
was tough on your end to see?

00:27:40.270 --> 00:27:43.660
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah, that was a
very difficult scene to film

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.870
because you're so--

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:48.940
we're also his friends.

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:52.600
The film aside, we
care deeply about Alex.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:56.500
And when you see someone
who has a great dream

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.180
and they've put
so much into it--

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.060
I mean, really, he's been
putting in years and years.

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.730
In the back of his mind, he's
been thinking about this.

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:06.760
And to have him
really try and fail,

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:11.720
I mean, that's always
hard, as a friend, to see.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.840
And so we felt a lot
of compassion for him.

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.790
But yet, then you had
to separate yourself

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:21.140
as a filmmaker and
film this awful moment

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.640
that he's just kind
of really distraught.

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:25.390
And you could see it
in his body language.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:26.020
He's all--

00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.311
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Hunched over.

00:28:27.311 --> 00:28:30.100
JIMMY CHIN: --hunched
over and disappointed.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.500
So those moments were
always difficult.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:36.700
That was very difficult because
none of us wanted to film it.

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:40.720
I was really happy that our
vérité DP was there filming it

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:44.097
because we all wanted to hide.

00:28:44.097 --> 00:28:45.555
But those are the
moments where you

00:28:45.555 --> 00:28:47.860
know it's an important moment.

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.840
You have to capture it.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.220
And it plays in the film.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:53.419
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Yeah.

00:28:53.419 --> 00:28:55.210
JIMMY CHIN: That's a
classic vérité moment,

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:57.230
where you can feel the moment.

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:59.650
Nobody has to explain to you
that he's disappointed in it,

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:00.566
or anything like that.

00:29:00.566 --> 00:29:01.960
You can see it.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:06.500
And that's like one of those
beautiful moments that I think

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:07.790
about vérité filmmaking.

00:29:07.790 --> 00:29:09.715
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Yeah,
that was something

00:29:09.715 --> 00:29:11.090
that when I was
watching it, felt

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:13.715
like seeing like a little kid
going up to someone that they

00:29:13.715 --> 00:29:16.670
really looked up and it's
like, I couldn't live up to it.

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:17.460
That was tough.

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:19.830
JIMMY CHIN: And it was the
worst that Peter was there,

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:22.970
the guy that he
looks up to the most.

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:27.530
That just is-- and
Peter saying, you

00:29:27.530 --> 00:29:28.992
don't ever have to go for it.

00:29:28.992 --> 00:29:29.950
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Yeah.

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:31.000
JIMMY CHIN: And
he's like, I know.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:31.950
JONATHAN DIBLASI: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:32.920
You just don't have to go.

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:33.830
JIMMY CHIN: He's like, I know.

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:34.940
I just need it to end.

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:41.540
And I get that, too,
because sometimes, it

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.910
makes a lot of sense,
these big objectives.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:45.680
And then sometimes,
you step back

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:47.740
and you're like,
what am I doing?

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.520
And I think that
those are probably

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.160
existential questions everybody
runs into occasionally.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.880
But he kind of perseveres
and pushes through it.

00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.880
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Yeah,
I think that's something

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.415
maybe everybody's asking.

00:30:00.415 --> 00:30:02.040
I asked you when we
were getting lunch.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:02.550
What's next?

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:04.940
But is there something
like that for you?

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:07.490
Maybe not necessarily so
like tortured-soul, I just

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:08.700
need this to end.

00:30:08.700 --> 00:30:11.420
But there is there
something for you and Chai

00:30:11.420 --> 00:30:14.480
that you're kind of striving
for on a filmmaking,

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.380
or climbing size, or
something like that?

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:21.920
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah, I think we
just want to make great films

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:27.010
and tell great stories, and
really kind of connect people.

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:31.410
And I think--

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:33.150
I already said this,
but a friend of ours

00:30:33.150 --> 00:30:36.480
called films empathy machines.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:39.690
You're just trying to create a
connection between the subject

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:43.890
and the viewer, and transport
someone, and hopefully

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:45.135
bring to light--

00:30:45.135 --> 00:30:47.150
like documentaries
in particular,

00:30:47.150 --> 00:30:50.040
they can really
bring to light a lot

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.560
of different political,
environmental, and social

00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:58.400
issues that are important
to highlight these days.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.800
And the long format seems to
be having a moment right now.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.840
Documentaries this
year-- there have

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.740
been more kind of bigger
box office documentary

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:11.760
releases this year than
we've ever seen before.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:16.662
And I can't tell if it's just
the product of the moment,

00:31:16.662 --> 00:31:23.120
kind of our news cycles
being so wildly fast,

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.080
and people not being
able to keep up with it.

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:30.330
And then having this kind of
long-form journalism, in a way,

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:32.400
making a comeback
because people want

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:39.300
to see depth and
connect with something

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:40.827
that actually has some weight.

00:31:40.827 --> 00:31:43.410
JONATHAN DIBLASI: I mean, I know
that's probably typical film,

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:43.910
in general.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:45.880
But it feels like an
escape from something.

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.379
Like you said, the news cycle,
just everything going on now,

00:31:48.379 --> 00:31:49.050
it's so crazy.

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:52.910
And to get to see something
like Alex free-soloing this,

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:55.770
it's so far from,
at least to me,

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:57.960
something that seems
"normal," and you

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.882
get to experience it in
such an intimate way.

00:32:00.882 --> 00:32:01.590
So I think that--

00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:03.750
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah,
I also think it's

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:07.920
nice to see something a
little uplifting these days

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.860
and to see someone
actually doing something.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:16.470
There's a very real
physical challenge,

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:17.820
a very real mental challenge.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:22.731
And someone trying to
do it and doing it--

00:32:22.731 --> 00:32:24.480
it's a little bit more
tangible than a lot

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.160
of things that come up.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.561
So I think that's why it's
having a moment right now,

00:32:29.561 --> 00:32:30.060
but--

00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:31.518
JONATHAN DIBLASI:
Yeah, definitely,

00:32:31.518 --> 00:32:35.260
so we were also talking
at lunch about kind

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:37.260
of the types of people
and the types of climbing

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:38.660
that they like.

00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.400
And obviously, climbing
is very quickly

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.120
growing in popularity,
very popular here.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:45.280
Look at all these people.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.720
But how have you personally
seen, in your own climbing

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.292
career, through making this
film, kind of climbing evolve

00:32:51.292 --> 00:32:52.750
and what are your
thoughts on that?

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:54.927
Where do you see it going?

00:32:54.927 --> 00:32:56.510
JIMMY CHIN: I mean,
I started climbing

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:58.160
because I loved being outside.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.840
I loved the adventure.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:01.080
I love the movement.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:05.660
I love the kind of physical
problem-solving, mental

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:06.690
problem-solving of it.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.330
But the main part being
wanting to be outside--

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:13.400
but it's funny now there's
so many climbing gyms

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.733
and everybody's climbing inside.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:18.850
Which I actually love doing--

00:33:18.850 --> 00:33:21.790
I went and climbed for a
few hours this morning.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:24.820
The movement is still
amazing, but I've always

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:28.920
tied it to exploring
the world and going

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:31.530
on these wild adventures.

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:32.760
But I don't know.

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:35.210
I think climbing--

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:38.280
I mean, I love the fact that
people are enjoying climbing

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:44.280
and then it's becoming more of
a mainstream activity, I guess.

00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:46.140
I think it's fun
to-- it's a good way

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:47.550
to hang out with your friends.

00:33:47.550 --> 00:33:50.850
It's a good way to kind
of go out and literally

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:55.080
be able to interact with an
environment or landscape.

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:58.740
As an activity, I
think, at least for me,

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:02.090
it opened my mind to trying to
go out and seek these places

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:03.890
where I could go and climb.

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:06.170
So it's been like
a great vehicle

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:12.150
to do a lot of fun stuff with
my friends and my family.

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:13.154
So I think it's great.

00:34:13.154 --> 00:34:14.570
JONATHAN DIBLASI:
Yeah, now so you

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:15.969
talk about climbing outside.

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:17.510
What are some of
your other projects?

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:21.110
I know with Alex, actually,
you had that "Expedition

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:22.670
Antarctica" coming up, right?

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:22.810
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah.

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:24.100
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Do you want
to talk a little bit about that?

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:25.850
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah,
well, Alex and I

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:32.750
went on expedition to Antarctica
last winter, last December.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:35.420
And Alex is still
climbing a lot.

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:38.574
He broke the speed record
on The Nose this spring.

00:34:38.574 --> 00:34:40.949
A lot of people are wondering
what he's going to do next.

00:34:40.949 --> 00:34:43.790
And I think he--

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:46.520
there's just a lot of different
expressions of climbing.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:49.089
Climbing isn't just
for him, free-soloing.

00:34:49.089 --> 00:34:50.630
There's sport climbing
and bouldering

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.659
and all these different
types of climbing.

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:58.430
And I think we all enjoy all
the different aspects of it.

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:02.170
And part of the other
thing about people climbing

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:05.530
and getting people to
really enjoy being outside

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:10.240
is I find that
people are much more

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:15.970
in tune with the environment
and environmental issues

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:19.347
when they love
being outside, and I

00:35:19.347 --> 00:35:20.930
think that that's a
really good thing.

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:23.500
I think that there's
potential for more

00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:26.080
environmental stewardship
just because people learn.

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:28.130
You want to protect
what you love.

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:32.650
And I think when people get
out and spend a lot of time

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:35.300
under this blue sky,
or under the stars,

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:39.570
or in the wilderness,
that's a good wilderness

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:41.934
therapy for everybody,
which I think we all need.

00:35:41.934 --> 00:35:44.100
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Yeah, I
mean, last thing, I guess,

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.245
before we go to that,
what do you have to plug?

00:35:46.245 --> 00:35:48.120
I mean, obviously, "Free
Solo," but what else

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:49.840
is going on with you?

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.745
JIMMY CHIN: Not much, I mean--

00:35:51.745 --> 00:35:53.760
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Tell
us about the whole--

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:56.550
I don't know if many people
know what actually happens

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:57.570
when you release a film.

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:59.550
JIMMY CHIN: Oh, yeah,
so I'm essentially

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:07.050
on the press junket or tour,
which is like four months long.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:09.600
So I haven't been home
since the end of August.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.300
And I've kind of just been--

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:17.190
and it's in support of the
film and it can feel tedious.

00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:21.600
But of course, the
film's done very well

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:25.830
and we couldn't be
happier, so just trying

00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:30.900
to feel grateful and
roll along with it.

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:34.740
Obviously, I really appreciate
people enjoying the film

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.150
and connecting with the film.

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:41.250
It's definitely gone
far beyond what I ever

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:44.840
imagined it would do, so we're
just very grateful for it,

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:45.500
yeah.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.640
JONATHAN DIBLASI:
Great, OK, I guess we'll

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.210
do some audience questions now.

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:52.734
I'll just take it in the front
'cause that's an easy one.

00:36:52.734 --> 00:36:54.642
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
so much for being here.

00:36:54.642 --> 00:36:55.350
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah.

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:57.330
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:59.287
And climbing's a
pretty esoteric sport

00:36:59.287 --> 00:37:01.870
and it's very rare that it kind
of breaks into the mainstream.

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:04.460
And so I think Tommy's
climb up Dawn Wall

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:07.980
or Alex's climb are a
few of those occasions.

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.900
What do you think the
impact of the success

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:12.350
of your film is going to have
on the future of climbing,

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:15.030
like, what people do, how many
people get into the sport, what

00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:16.620
risks they take?

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:18.720
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah, I think--

00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.839
I can't tell if it's the
chicken or the egg thing.

00:37:20.839 --> 00:37:22.380
I can't tell if the
film's doing well

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.364
because there's
been this huge surge

00:37:24.364 --> 00:37:25.530
in the interest in climbing.

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:27.720
But certainly, with
this film coming out,

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:32.190
it's definitely hit
a broader audience

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:34.740
than we've ever seen before.

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:39.620
And I feel good about
people wanting to climb

00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:43.790
and being interested in climbing
for some of the reasons I said.

00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:48.260
But it's also about
beyond climbing.

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:52.625
I hope people get something out
of that story, about taking--

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:57.620
facing their fears
and really trying

00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:01.050
to achieve what they never
thought possible before.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:04.050
And I think that he embodies
that in such an incredible way

00:38:04.050 --> 00:38:11.150
that that's more of my kind of
hope with it beyond climbing,

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.794
I guess.

00:38:11.794 --> 00:38:13.710
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Great,
we're going to take--

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:16.370
we'll switch between Dory so
that people that weren't able

00:38:16.370 --> 00:38:17.490
to make it in person--

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:18.985
so and you can see it up top.

00:38:18.985 --> 00:38:21.890
But "when editing this together,
were there creative decisions

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:24.620
made around portraying
this solo as dangerous,

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.230
that's not oversimplified
the act of soloing?

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:29.210
Do you worry about
the repercussions

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:32.270
of newer soloers upping their
game after seeing this film?"

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:36.290
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah,
so we really just--

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:42.980
in some ways, are kind of
MO is always restraint.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:47.510
And we certainly didn't have
to make the free solo seem

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:53.630
more scary than it
already was because you

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:54.690
try to be objective.

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:58.250
You try to-- as a filmmaker, you
try to kind of tell the story

00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:59.120
as it is.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.690
You want to give an honest
representation of what it is.

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:06.710
So we were very restrained
on how we covered it.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:11.750
I mean, my crew, when
they saw the film,

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:16.332
were all like, that is so
restrained compared to what--

00:39:16.332 --> 00:39:18.290
JONATHAN DIBLASI: It
should gnarlier than this?

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:19.581
JIMMY CHIN: --they think it is.

00:39:19.581 --> 00:39:23.350
Because yeah, I mean, it's hard
to cover a 3,000-foot climb.

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:27.010
Like the number of
difficult moves on that wall

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:29.500
that aren't in the movie--

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.690
I mean, that climb
is, in some ways,

00:39:31.690 --> 00:39:35.020
notorious and terrifying
to think about even

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:38.710
as a professional
climber, even with a rope.

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:41.920
I mean, when we were
filming on that last week

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.680
before he did it, there
was a team from Germany

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.090
sponsored by Adidas--

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:48.430
"ah-di-das"-- and they were--

00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:50.680
they spent five
days on the wall.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.530
And they never climbed
every pitch clean,

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:57.070
meaning that they fell
multiple times on several

00:39:57.070 --> 00:40:00.790
of the difficult pitches
and never climbed

00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:03.430
some of those pitches
clean without falling.

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:06.760
And they spent five days on it.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:11.050
He climbed it in three
hours and 56 minutes, OK?

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:13.300
So it's not like--

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:15.640
I mean, it's just beyond.

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.580
So in some ways,
it's very restrained.

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.490
I think we get people the
sense of the magnitude

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:24.370
and that's what we
really tried to do.

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:28.090
In terms of worrying about
repercussions of newer soloers,

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:28.840
the way Alex--

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:34.710
I didn't worry
about that as much

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:37.730
just because
free-soloing is kind

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:42.680
of a self-regulating activity.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.300
You can be like, you know what?

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:45.987
I want to go free solo El Cap.

00:40:45.987 --> 00:40:47.570
And then you go to
the base of El Cap,

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:50.540
and then you look up at
it, and you're like, whoa.

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:53.960
And then you climb like
15 feet up off the ground,

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.790
and you're like,
wait, I can't actually

00:40:55.790 --> 00:40:58.460
physically move up any further.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.890
And this is really
scary to go back down.

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:06.380
So I mean, there's
self-regulating in a way.

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:11.160
But I have thought
about a bit more

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.740
about if people are
going to push themselves

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.990
as free-soloists.

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:18.760
I just hope everybody--

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:24.240
yeah, I mean, I shouldn't
say the Darwin Awards,

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:32.111
but there's certain activities
that might happen that you just

00:41:32.111 --> 00:41:32.610
can't--

00:41:32.610 --> 00:41:33.810
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Can't
be held responsible for.

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:35.560
JIMMY CHIN: --be
held responsible for.

00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:35.750
But--

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:37.620
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Do you have
any plans to actually release

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.540
the full four
hour-- do you have--

00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:41.190
JIMMY CHIN: People
have asked that.

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:44.790
We do because we certainly
have the whole thing shot

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:47.850
from the long lens
and then pieces

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:49.230
all up and down the route.

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:53.240
But people have asked us,
are you guys ever going to--

00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:55.050
I mean, maybe some day.

00:41:55.050 --> 00:42:00.010
If you see a release on Netflix
four hours of pure climbing

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:02.290
porn.

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:03.160
Maybe it'd do well.

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.599
Maybe we should release that.

00:42:04.599 --> 00:42:06.140
JONATHAN DIBLASI:
If it happens, it's

00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:07.580
because of this room
of people, right?

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:08.663
JIMMY CHIN: Yes, it could.

00:42:08.663 --> 00:42:10.010
This is a very influential room.

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:10.610
It's cool.

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:12.610
JONATHAN DIBLASI: All
right, audience question--

00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:13.810
SPEAKER 1: One-- I'm going to--

00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:15.643
AUDIENCE: So my question
is about, actually,

00:42:15.643 --> 00:42:17.980
"Meru" and your first attempt.

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:20.950
So you mentioned that there
were several times where

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:23.710
you used the team--

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:26.050
near the top, you
guys set several lines

00:42:26.050 --> 00:42:29.140
and then proceeded to cross
those lines several times

00:42:29.140 --> 00:42:30.730
before finally turning back.

00:42:30.730 --> 00:42:33.617
How do you go about making those
decisions, setting those lines,

00:42:33.617 --> 00:42:35.200
and deciding which
ones you will cross

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.690
and which ones you
will not cross?

00:42:37.690 --> 00:42:40.435
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:44.275
Because some of it feels--

00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:51.110
it's hard to articulate
specific guidelines.

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:54.790
But I mean, that's what
experience comes from, I think.

00:42:54.790 --> 00:43:00.590
And you really have to
follow your instincts.

00:43:00.590 --> 00:43:03.020
A lot of those
instincts also come

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:08.405
from knowing that you have
to step outside of yourself.

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.330
And certainly the
ego plays a role

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:17.820
in making sometimes
bad decisions.

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:20.480
So you really have
to kind of step

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.480
outside of yourself,
kind of be objective

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:27.980
about the actual variables or
inputs that you're getting.

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:29.930
I mean, the thing about
it in the mountains

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:33.020
and in life, I guess, there
are variables you can control

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.570
and there variables you can't
control, and a lot of it

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:39.080
is identifying which is which.

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:45.260
And our assess-- that's
always very important.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:49.910
And that meaning that when you
identify the variables that you

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:57.350
do control, that you take
great efforts in managing

00:43:57.350 --> 00:44:00.680
those variables the
best that you can.

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.880
In terms of crossing
those lines,

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:06.800
it's kind of an ongoing
assessment of the risks.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:12.110
And sometimes, you set a
line and when you get to it

00:44:12.110 --> 00:44:15.290
and you look around, and
you are being objective

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:19.130
about the inputs
that you're getting,

00:44:19.130 --> 00:44:21.212
oftentimes they're telling
you to turn around.

00:44:21.212 --> 00:44:22.670
But sometimes, you
get to that line

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:26.270
and you're like, oh, actually,
we still have some margin.

00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:30.920
And we'll now set another
line as kind of a marker,

00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.640
whether that's--

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.545
yeah, I guess it
would be sometimes

00:44:34.545 --> 00:44:36.420
it's a physical line or
an intellectual line.

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:40.230
But and then you kind of
take the necessary steps

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:41.610
to get to that
next line and then

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:44.490
you make another evaluation.

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:46.380
I think it's hard
because people sometimes

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:50.670
assume that you draw the line
and then you're breaking--

00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:52.770
you're doing something
that you don't want to do,

00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:54.840
or shouldn't be doing
by crossing a line.

00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.006
But it's actually because
you've gotten to the line,

00:44:57.006 --> 00:45:01.230
made another evaluation, and
then decided to move forward.

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:03.860
Eventually, you get to
the edge of that line,

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:06.810
or you get to the edge,
you get to that next line,

00:45:06.810 --> 00:45:09.370
and you look at it
again and you think, OK,

00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:11.301
this is a turnaround moment.

00:45:11.301 --> 00:45:11.800
So--

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:12.540
JONATHAN DIBLASI:
Yeah, I remember

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.150
there's a part in the film
where you say Alex is constantly

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:18.550
pushing the edge and eventually
he could find that edge, right?

00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:20.460
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah,
and that's something

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:24.000
that you do a lot in the
world that I live in.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.270
But it's kind of
hard to articulate

00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:30.870
all the different reasons
why and when you turn around.

00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:34.020
Clearly, it's based
on the risk-reward,

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.580
or if the stakes are too high.

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:40.854
But those are evaluations that
you're making all the time.

00:45:40.854 --> 00:45:42.520
JONATHAN DIBLASI:
Yeah, all right, we'll

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:44.400
do another Dory question.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.690
We've got another high
stakes thing-- "so

00:45:46.690 --> 00:45:48.190
at one point in
the film, Alex said

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:51.460
he didn't want cameras on
him for the boulder problem.

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:53.590
I think he said, no
one needs to see that.

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:55.960
Obviously, that part was
filmed and it was epic.

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.030
Is that something you
discussed with Alex prior?

00:45:58.030 --> 00:46:00.940
Did it take some convincing?

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:04.570
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah, well,
I'm glad people are

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:07.550
paying attention in the movie.

00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:08.555
This is a very--

00:46:08.555 --> 00:46:10.180
it seems like everybody
that works here

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.490
pays very close attention.

00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:12.740
JONATHAN DIBLASI: It's Google.

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:14.750
JIMMY CHIN: It is Google.

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:17.320
But yes, he does say that
he doesn't want anybody

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:19.540
to film it at one point.

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:24.520
Then he goes up, he fails
on that one attempt.

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:28.570
And his realization
and learning from it

00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:32.920
is that, OK, if I'm going to
climb in front of my friends,

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:35.950
it just means I have to
be way better prepared.

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:38.860
In the film, it's kind of
portrayed that he turns around

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:41.260
because of too many people
around and the cameras

00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:44.890
and stuff, but he actually
just wasn't really ready.

00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:48.190
His ankle was still swollen
and it was really cold,

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:50.950
that he couldn't feel his toes.

00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:52.540
But he did realize,
look, I just have

00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:56.522
to be better prepared, which
we all thought was great.

00:46:56.522 --> 00:46:57.940
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Yeah.

00:46:57.940 --> 00:46:59.980
JIMMY CHIN: So as he
got closer and closer

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:03.635
in his training to the day
that he actually went for it,

00:47:03.635 --> 00:47:06.590
it was a very ongoing,
open conversation.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:11.110
The thing is, I was never
pushing for it because I

00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:14.560
didn't need to push Alex and say
we really want a camera there.

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:21.020
We really-- he knows exactly
what this is all about.

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.920
And that, of course,
if possible, we'd

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:24.890
have a camera there.

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:26.980
But if not, that's fine.

00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:28.840
That's the whole
neutrality thing,

00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:34.240
where you could never
let the needs of the film

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.540
outweigh the needs of Alex
and his experience, which

00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:38.930
is how we went into the film.

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:41.980
We were very clear with
him and with the crew

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:46.970
and with our executive producers
and with the studio that this--

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:49.930
the film, so you understand--

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:52.090
the needs of the film
will never outweigh

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:53.620
his safety and his experience.

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:57.230
So eventually, we
had that conversation

00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:58.480
and he was like, yeah.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:00.710
He's like, definitely,
that's fine.

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:02.860
That's not going to bother me.

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:05.360
But I don't want a person there.

00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:10.800
So we put remote cameras
there and it was fine.

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:12.971
And the reason being
that clearly, he didn't--

00:48:12.971 --> 00:48:15.220
if he fell, that he didn't
want his friends to see it.

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:21.110
But he knew that he
wouldn't be stressed

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:25.560
that we would be projecting
fear onto him, which would then

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:29.020
change how he was
feeling in the climb.

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:31.407
And so that's why we had
him face the cameras.

00:48:31.407 --> 00:48:33.240
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Yeah,
throughout the film,

00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:35.864
generally, when you were
shown, you were kind of--

00:48:35.864 --> 00:48:37.280
JIMMY CHIN: I was
always stressed.

00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:39.863
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Yeah, I mean,
very stressed, understandably.

00:48:39.863 --> 00:48:42.450
But you were-- at least
for his final attempt

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:44.266
where he succeeds,
you were at the top.

00:48:44.266 --> 00:48:45.390
You weren't really filming.

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:47.181
Were you kind of just
directing there, or--

00:48:47.181 --> 00:48:49.484
JIMMY CHIN: [CHUCKLES]
No, I was actually--

00:48:49.484 --> 00:48:50.900
it does look like
I was at the top

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:54.510
because I was actually
filming the enduro corner.

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:58.560
But so I was also shooting
a "National Geographic"

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:01.029
assignment for the magazine
during the two years

00:49:01.029 --> 00:49:02.570
we were producing
and directing this,

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:07.650
so I had a still camera bolted
to the top of my film camera.

00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:11.400
And so after I filmed
him on the enduro corner,

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:14.790
I was shooting stills
simultaneously.

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:16.470
Then he goes up
and he traverses,

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:21.960
but we didn't have enough
cameramen to shoot.

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.490
I had one on the top.

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:25.710
Basically, my vérité DP went--

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:27.840
shot him going to the base
and then ran all the way

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:28.980
around and up to the top.

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:34.070
Yeah, it's a long ways.

00:49:34.070 --> 00:49:37.280
But that's the basic
expectation now

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.080
that you have to be
able to move like that.

00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:41.330
But I didn't have a
still photographer

00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:43.460
up there, and
obviously, if you're

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:46.470
shooting in a two-year
assignment of Alex free-soloing

00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:49.310
El Cap you kind of have
to get him topping out.

00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:54.710
So as soon as he crossed above
me and over on the traverse,

00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:58.370
I had to put all the camera
equipment away and jug up

00:49:58.370 --> 00:49:59.890
to the top.

00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:05.232
But it's like close to
1,000 feet, or 800 feet.

00:50:05.232 --> 00:50:07.870
And so I'm just going
[GROWLING] as fast as I can,

00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:09.020
and he's around the corner.

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:12.310
I can't see him, but
the whole ground crew

00:50:12.310 --> 00:50:14.410
was watching in the
long lens and they

00:50:14.410 --> 00:50:17.730
said we were going
the exact same speed.

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:20.210
And they were like,
go, Jimmy, go, go, go.

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:25.510
And then the lines
intersected at one point.

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:28.950
So right when I got to this
one anchor, I looked down

00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:30.930
and Alex is like
scampering up the rock.

00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:36.570
And I was just like, Alex,
just give me 60 seconds.

00:50:36.570 --> 00:50:38.130
And he pulled out his phone.

00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:39.870
He looked at his phone
and he just said,

00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:42.630
I'm about to break four hours.

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:44.590
And we didn't say another
word to each other

00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:46.470
because I knew what that meant.

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:50.180
I was like, Alex does not want
four hours and one minute.

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:53.370
And so I just turned
around and I jugged as fast

00:50:53.370 --> 00:50:55.680
I could to the top.

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.716
And that's why I'm like
sweating profusely if--

00:50:57.716 --> 00:51:00.090
JONATHAN DIBLASI: I thought
it was just the stress, but--

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:01.476
JIMMY CHIN: Well,
it was that, too.

00:51:01.476 --> 00:51:02.517
JONATHAN DIBLASI: --both?

00:51:02.517 --> 00:51:04.670
JIMMY CHIN: Clumps
of hair falling out.

00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:06.570
No, but so I had
to get in the top

00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:08.980
and shoot the photos
of him topping out.

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:11.764
I beat him by like a
minute, or something.

00:51:11.764 --> 00:51:12.930
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Good work.

00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:13.638
JIMMY CHIN: Yeah.

00:51:13.638 --> 00:51:16.530
JONATHAN DIBLASI: All right,
we probably have time for one

00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:19.510
more in-person question.

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:20.350
AUDIENCE: Hi, there.

00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:21.370
Thanks for coming.

00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:23.250
My questions are two-part.

00:51:23.250 --> 00:51:25.980
One is how is your
relationship with Alex

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:28.890
changed since the
filming process

00:51:28.890 --> 00:51:30.410
and ending this with him?

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:32.160
And maybe more
philosophically, how do you

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.650
think Alex's relationship
with climbing has changed

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:38.699
after he's finished this climb?

00:51:38.699 --> 00:51:40.490
JIMMY CHIN: Well, my
relationship with Alex

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:44.780
is about the same.

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:47.079
He likes to throw me under
the bus every so often.

00:51:47.079 --> 00:51:49.120
I like to throw him under
the bus every so often.

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:51.440
No, but we've always had
a very good relationship.

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:54.410
And I think Alex--

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:55.760
actually, I think we are closer.

00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.710
I mean, through--
the process certainly

00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:59.510
has brought us closer.

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:04.730
I also think that he is
really appreciative of what

00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:06.560
the film is because
he didn't ever

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.030
really care about the film.

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:09.650
He cared about
free-soloing El Cap.

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:12.550
He knew that we were
doing our thing,

00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:15.530
but I think he's been surprised
at how well it's been received

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:19.100
and that people really
feel inspired by him

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:27.550
or connected to him, and
I think he enjoys that.

00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:31.150
He loves going to watch
the end of the film

00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:35.020
'cause he's like, oh, I get
to relive the best moment

00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:38.380
of my life on this huge
screen with all these people,

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:41.890
all the time now.

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:45.370
But his relationship to climbing
though and free-soloing--

00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:51.500
I mean, he is still going to
climb as much as he possibly

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:53.720
can because he loves climbing.

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:57.530
Is he going to be pushing
for huge free-solos?

00:52:57.530 --> 00:52:59.540
I doubt-- I don't know.

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:03.320
I think he's just
like most climbers.

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:06.440
You have to be kind of
motivated and inspired

00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:09.410
to climb something,
to really go after it.

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:13.070
But I think that he
has in soloing El Cap--

00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:18.240
I mean, there isn't a whole--
there isn't a whole lot

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:20.970
else where you can go with it.

00:53:20.970 --> 00:53:24.200
He's free-soloed
El Cap, so I think

00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:28.010
he'll probably focus
his energy on all

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:30.650
the different expressions of
climbing that are out there

00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:31.830
and enjoy his moment.

00:53:31.830 --> 00:53:33.650
And he's really--
his whole thing, too,

00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:35.690
is that he's like,
fame is useless

00:53:35.690 --> 00:53:38.050
unless you can use it for good.

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:40.040
And so he's pivoting
a lot of the attention

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:44.540
towards his Honnold Foundation,
which does solar projects

00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:45.710
around the world.

00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:51.009
And that is something that
he really believes in.

00:53:51.009 --> 00:53:52.550
JONATHAN DIBLASI:
Yeah, that's great.

00:53:52.550 --> 00:53:55.200
So I think that is probably all
the time we have for questions.

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.102
I mean, with the
remaining few minutes

00:53:57.102 --> 00:53:59.060
that we have, anything
you want to plug, pitch?

00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.860
JIMMY CHIN: No, not
really, I mean, I just

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:03.390
hope you all enjoy the film.

00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:06.680
And I really appreciate,
again, that you follow the work

00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:09.740
and that you're going to see it,
and that you came out to see me

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:10.380
today.

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.984
I guess, I mean, that's awesome,
so thank you so much, yeah.

00:54:12.984 --> 00:54:14.150
JONATHAN DIBLASI: Thank you.

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:16.300
[APPLAUSE]
