00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.820
One of the most subtly hurtful and quietly
damning of all remarks, perhaps quietly and

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.110
sweetly delivered on the doorstep at the end
of a long evening, with the taxi still hovering

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:16.900
somewhere just out of sight, is the suggestion
that we should in the end probably remain

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:24.760
‘just good friends’. We know exactly what
to understand by this. The path towards a

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.510
tender future is being gently but firmly closed
off. We are, with a smile, being shunted into

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.659
the category of the failed, the ignored and
the lightly despised. The other must in some

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:42.640
way have worked out the despicable truths
about us – all the ones that we tried so

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.670
hard to disguise and even to believe didn’t
exist – and has logically decided to take

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.239
their leave. We return crushed to an apartment
which we had left with butterflies and elevated

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.949
hopes only a few hours before. We hear the
invitation to a friendship as synonymous with

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:09.399
insult because our Romantic culture has continuously,
and from a young age, made one thing sharply

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:18.280
clear to us: love is the purpose of existence;
friendship is the paltry, depleted consolation

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.420
prize. Though this seems like unsurprising
common sense, what should detain us and encourage

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:32.640
us to probe a little at the claims made on
love’s behalf is one basic source of evidence:

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:40.520
the behaviour, level of satisfaction and state
of mind of lovers themselves. If we were to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.340
judge love chiefly by its impact, by the extent
of the tears, the depths of the frustrations,

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.969
the viciousness of the insults that unfold
in its name, we would not continue to rate

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:59.659
it as we do and might indeed mistake it for
a form of illness or aberration of the mind.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.700
The scenes that typically unfold between lovers
would scarcely be considered imaginable outside

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.380
of conditions of open hostility. Those we
love, we honour with our worst moods, our

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.760
most unfair accusations, our most wounding
insults. It is to our lovers that we direct

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.260
blame for everything that has gone wrong in
our lives, it is they we expect to know everything

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.560
we mean without bothering to explain it, it
is to their minor errors and misunderstandings

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:38.310
that we respond with sulks and rage. And,
by comparison, in friendship, the supposedly

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.500
worthless and inferior state whose mention
should crush us at the end of a date, we bring

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.879
our highest and noblest virtues. Here we are
patient, encouraging, tolerant, funny and

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:58.660
– most of all – kind. We expect a little
less and therefore, by extension, forgive

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.879
an infinite amount more. We do not presume
that we will be fully understood, and so treat

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.970
failings lightly and humanely. We don’t
imagine that our friends should admire us

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.930
without reserve and stick by us whatever we
do, and so we put in effort and behave, pleasing

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:22.910
ourselves as well as our companions along
the way. We are, in the company of our friends,

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:30.360
our best selves. Paradoxically, it is friendship
that offers us the real route to the pleasures

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.890
that Romanticism associates with love. That
this sounds surprising is only a reflection

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.270
of how underdeveloped our day to day vision
of friendship has become. We associate it

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:47.140
with a casual acquaintance we see only once
in a while to exchange inconsequential and

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:54.049
shallow banter. But real friendship is something
altogether more profound and worthy of exultation:

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.799
it is an arena in which two people can get
a sense of each other’s vulnerabilities;

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.340
appreciate each other’s follies without
recrimination, reassure one another as to

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.640
their value and greet the sorrows and tragedies
of existence with wit and warmth. Culturally

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.480
and collectively, we have made a momentous
mistake which has left us both lonelier and

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:20.360
more disappointed than we ever needed to be.
In a better world, our most serious goal would

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:26.070
not be to locate one special lover with whom
to replace all other humans, it would be to

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:33.801
put our intelligence and energy into identifying
and nurturing a circle of true friends. At

00:04:33.801 --> 00:04:38.551
the end of an evening, we would learn to say
to certain prospective companions, with an

00:04:38.551 --> 00:04:43.240
embarrassed smile as we invited them inside
– knowing that this would come across as

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:50.880
a properly painful rejection – ‘I’m
so sorry, couldn’t we just be… lovers?’
