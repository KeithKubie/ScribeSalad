00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.690
We're told in this question
that on a string instrument,

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.320
the length of a
string-- so let's

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.550
call that l-- the
length of a string l

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.220
varies inversely
as the frequency,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.219
so varies inversely
as the frequency.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.870
So l is going to be equal
to some constant times

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.610
the inverse of the frequency.

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:28.500
And I'll use f for
frequency-- the frequency

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.460
of its vibrations.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.320
And then they tell
us the vibrations

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.080
are what give the string
instruments their sound.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.480
That's nice.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.270
An 11-inch-- and it's
actually the vibrations

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.490
of the string affecting
the air, and then

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.880
the air compressions
eventually get to our eardrum.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.940
And that's actually what gives
us the perception of the sound.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.630
But we don't want to delve too
much into the physics of it.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.880
An 11-inch inches
string has a frequency.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.430
So 11-inch, so
this is its length.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.410
So the 11-inch string
has a frequency

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.680
of 400 cycles per second.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.050
So this right here
is the frequency.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.470
A cycle per second is
also called a Hertz.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.670
Find the constant
of proportionality,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.060
and then find the frequency
of a 10-inch string.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.630
So they say an 11-inch string.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.390
So 11-inch string is
equal to some constant

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.740
of proportionality times
1/400 cycles per second.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:30.870
So one over 400
cycles per second.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:32.570
I'll write second as sec.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.180
So to solve for the
constant of proportionality,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.690
we need to multiply both sides
by 400 cycles per second.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.660
Multiply the left hand side
by 400 cycles per second,

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.710
and the left hand side
becomes 400 times 11.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.280
Well, 4 times 11 is 44.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.790
So 400 times 11 is 4,400.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.150
And then we have in our units,
just for out of interest,

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.210
our units are cycles
times inches per second.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.780
So it's cycles times
inches in the numerator

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.270
of our units divided by seconds.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.270
And that is equal to our
constant of proportionality.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:34.230
So we can say that the length is
equal to 4,400 times-- or 4,400

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.520
cycles times inches per second--
I want to get the units right--

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.620
per second, times 1
over the frequency.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.400
So we solved for our
constant of proportionality.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.530
And then we can use this
to find the frequency

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.547
of a 10-inch string.

00:02:53.547 --> 00:02:55.130
So now we're talking
about a situation

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.300
where our length is 10
inches, so 10 inches.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:07.170
So we get 10 inches
are equal to 4,400--

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.770
as you can imagine, these
units are a little cumbersome--

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:19.080
but 4,400 cycles times
inches per second times

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.020
1 over the frequency.

00:03:23.547 --> 00:03:25.130
And so we could do
a couple of things.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.390
We could just multiply
both sides of this equation

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.430
by the frequency so that it
gets out of the denominator.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.150
So let's do that.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.285
Let's multiply both
sides by the frequency.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.860
And then we could also divide
both sides by 10 inches

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:40.670
to get rid of this.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.140
And then we'll just have
frequency on the left hand

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.639
side.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.520
So we divide both
sides by 10 inches.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.255
And then we divide
it by 10 inches.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.000
The left hand side, we're
just left with the frequency.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.880
On the right hand side, we
have 4,400 divided by 10.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.310
4,400 divided by 10 is 440.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.420
And then you have cycles, inches
over second divided by inches.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.750
Well, the inches
cancel out with inches.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.450
And you're just left
with cycles per second.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.779
And then obviously, 1/f times
f cancels out to just being 1.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:21.450
So we get our frequency
when our string

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.500
is when our string
is 10 inches long,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.960
our frequency has increased
to 440 cycles per second.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.510
From when it was 11 inches,
when it was slightly longer,

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.920
our frequency was 400
cycles per second.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.350
When our string got little
bit shorter, one inch shorter,

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:41.800
now our frequency increased
by 40 cycles per second.
