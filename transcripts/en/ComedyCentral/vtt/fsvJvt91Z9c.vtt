- Coch Brothers, you're really
making it difficult for me

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:07.340 line:0%
to boycott you, alright?

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.242 line:0%
They can't possibly
make anything else

00:00:09.242 --> 00:00:11.378 line:0%
that's an integral part
of my every day life.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:12.846 line:0%

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:16.850 line:0%
The world's most
comfortable fabric?

(audience laughing)

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.586 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
Okay, we have to go figure
this out because nobody

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:20.820 line:0%
is taking my lycra.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.690
(audience laughing)

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.158
- I think there's
always this stuff,

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.593 align:start size:94% position:6%
the Illuminati, people
are controlling the world.

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:28.661 align:start size:97% position:3%
No, it's two old white
dudes and they're brothers.

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:29.496
(laughing)

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:31.197
You can see them.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:34.501
And it's, they're
not underground,

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.403
they're near Palm Springs, man.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.004
- You both get offered a gig

00:00:38.004 --> 00:00:39.773
opening for the Coch Brothers.

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:40.840
(audience laughing)

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.009
And it pays a lot of money.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:44.978
And don't even try to tell
me you're not gonna do it,

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:46.980 align:start size:84% position:16%
cause every comic
has a price, alright.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.715
So I know you're gonna do it.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:49.983
- Yes!

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:50.950
- I'm just gonna
throw out numbers.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.452
- You don't have to finish that.

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:53.686
- Okay, $1,000.

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:56.122
- No.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:58.058
- $1,000, no.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:58.892
- [Larry] $10,000?

00:00:58.892 --> 00:00:59.959
- [Hari] No.

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:00.894
- [Larry] $100,000?

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.062
You're thinking about it.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:02.862 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'm thinking
about $10,000, yeah.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:03.797
(audience laughing)

00:01:03.797 --> 00:01:04.731
- You're thinking about $10,000?

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:05.999

Just don't poke me.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:11.538
I do not like being poked.

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:12.906
You can candy crush me.
