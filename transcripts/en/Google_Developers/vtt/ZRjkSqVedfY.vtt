00:00:04.832 --> 00:00:06.540
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
Welcome to Let's Talk,

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.500
Designing Quality Conversations
for Google Assistant.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.470
My name is Jessica Early-Cha,
and I'm a Developer Advocate

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.580
for Actions on Google.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.830
CATHY PEARL: And I'm Cathy
Pearl, Head of Conversation

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.073
Design Outreach.

00:00:17.073 --> 00:00:18.740
And if you want to
tweet about our talk,

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.657
that would be awesome.

00:00:19.657 --> 00:00:21.875
Be sure and use the
hashtag AoGDevs.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.040
Over the last few
days you've been

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.260
hearing a lot about
how developers

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.540
can add their content
to the Google Assistant

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.759
by creating something
called an action.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.260
And you can think
of an action kind

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.510
of like an application on our
platform, Actions on Google.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.750
And it enables people
to have a conversation

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.330
with a Google Assistant
about any content

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.010
that you want to put out there.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.620
And it'll be available on
lots of different devices,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.953
and we've got tools and options
to help you get started.

00:00:48.953 --> 00:00:51.537
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Definitely--
there's tons of different ways

00:00:51.537 --> 00:00:52.710
to make an action.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.600
And we actually recently
released several new ways.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.120
And so if you're
a content owner,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.080
let's say you have a how to
guide or video on YouTube,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.260
you can add that content
using templates or markup.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.880
If you're an Android
developer, you

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.640
could connect your Android
app to Google Assistant

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.540
with App Actions.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.520
And of course, if you're
a hardware developer,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.670
you want to connect all
your really cool devices

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.220
using our Smart home SDK.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.687
And what's really cool
is, the first three--

00:01:19.687 --> 00:01:22.020
Google Assistant handles the
natural language processing

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.830
for you.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.950
So you don't have to manage the
back and forth and figuring out

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.050
what the user really
means, which is fantastic.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.960
But what's really,
really great is

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.310
there is a space where you
could be really creative.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.490
And this is where we
have conversation actions

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.590
and using tools like
Interactive Canvas, where

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.955
you create completely new
experiences for your users.

00:01:42.557 --> 00:01:44.140
CATHY PEARL: And as
Jessica mentioned,

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.470
sometimes the how tos, the App
Actions, and things like that

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.120
aren't necessarily
everything you

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.760
need to create your interesting
and complex experience.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.570
So in that case a custom
action is a great way to go.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.940
And when you build a custom
action in particular,

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.310
you really need to
think about design.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.680
We've all had very
frustrating experiences

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.768
with our voice assistance.

00:02:03.768 --> 00:02:05.560
And a lot of times
that's not because there

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.380
was a technical issue, but
because it was poorly designed.

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.270
And we want to help you
build the best custom

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.153
actions possible.

00:02:11.153 --> 00:02:12.820
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
And we know that when

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.040
designers and developers,
when we work together,

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.873
quality goes up.

00:02:15.873 --> 00:02:18.040
And the likelihood of users
returning to your action

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.240
goes up, too.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.490
CATHY PEARL: We also know
that not every developer has

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.840
their own personal designer.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.177
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
[LAUGHS] Thank you.

00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:27.010
So today we're going
to walk through a bunch

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.780
of different examples
and things we

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.243
could do today to make
better quality conversations.

00:02:34.243 --> 00:02:36.410
CATHY PEARL: So let's talk
about conversation design

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.740
and the first rule of
conversation design

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.883
is to write sample dialogues.

00:02:42.883 --> 00:02:44.300
You can think of
a sample dialogue

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.470
kind of like a movie script.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.290
It's basically a back and
forth between your user

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:49.202
and the Assistant.

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:50.660
And it's a great
way to get started

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.820
brainstorming,
trying out new ideas,

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.770
sharing them with stakeholders.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.620
And don't worry about
getting them perfect.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.590
Because believe me, the
first time I write my sample

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.040
dialogue, it's never perfect.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.850
It's never the thing
I use in the end.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.420
Just remember that old rule--

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.180
there's no such thing
as good writing,

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.970
there is only good rewriting.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.670
And just like when
you're in Hollywood

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.190
and you're writing a movie
script, you do a table read.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.570
You read them out loud.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.300
Take your sample dialogues,
find a few people,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.440
read them back and forth.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.857
It's great if you
can find someone

00:03:22.857 --> 00:03:25.260
to be your user who's not
familiar with your design.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.190
And you will quickly
discover problems and bugs

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.230
that you had no idea
were there before you've

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.705
written a single line of code.

00:03:33.705 --> 00:03:36.080
So Jessica, why don't we do
a sample dialogue right here,

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.947
right now, on stage?

00:03:36.947 --> 00:03:38.280
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Sounds great.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.450
CATHY PEARL: All right.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.880
Let's say we're going
to make an action that

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.943
lets you rate jokes.

00:03:41.943 --> 00:03:42.860
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: OK.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.880
CATHY PEARL: Will
you be my user?

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.630
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Of
course, I'll be the user.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.672
And you'll be the action.

00:03:45.672 --> 00:03:46.890
CATHY PEARL: All right.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:47.807
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: OK.

00:03:47.807 --> 00:03:50.042
Hey, Google, talk to Joke Rater.

00:03:50.042 --> 00:03:51.500
CATHY PEARL: Welcome
to Joke Rater.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.840
I'll tell you a joke,
and you can rate it.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.070
Are you ready?

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.632
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Yah.

00:03:56.632 --> 00:03:57.590
CATHY PEARL: All right.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.220
What's brown and sticky?

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.015
A stick.

00:04:01.015 --> 00:04:03.140
Now I'm not sure if I'm
going to have them rate it,

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.030
like, one to five, or
a Likert scale or--

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.720
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
Remember, Cathy, we're

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.260
supposed to just do
the sample dialogue,

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.450
not what actually happened.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:09.470
CATHY PEARL: All right.

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.018
Now rate that joke.

00:04:12.018 --> 00:04:14.060
You might be wondering
why did Jessica and I have

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.840
our backs turned.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.550
That might seem
a little strange.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.800
And that's because when
humans communicate,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.829
they do so much more
than just use words.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.300
There's eye gaze.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.320
There's body language.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:31.180
There's pauses, there's
intonation, all these things--

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.010
that guess what?

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.222
The computer is
not going to get.

00:04:34.222 --> 00:04:35.930
So you really want to
focus on the words.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.390
And when we're back to back,
it forces you to do that.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.910
If I was talking to Jessica
and one of my prompts

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.340
was kind of confusing, she
might just kind of look at me,

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.660
and I'd probably just
naturally repeat myself.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.910
But your computer is not
going to be able to do that.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.368
So when you do back
to back, you're

00:04:49.368 --> 00:04:53.040
forced to focus
on just the words.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.590
Let's walk through an
example of a sample dialog

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.940
that we wrote down for a fake
action called cool animal

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.487
facts.

00:04:59.487 --> 00:05:00.570
Will you be my user again?

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.320
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
Of course, Cathy.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.180
CATHY PEARL: All right.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.480
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: OK.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.510
OK, Google.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.600
Talk to Cool Animal Facts.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.350
CATHY PEARL: Welcome
to Cool Animal Facts.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.230
What animal would you
like to know about?

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.213
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
I love penguins.

00:05:12.213 --> 00:05:13.380
CATHY PEARL: Cool, penguins.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.360
Would you like to know
about their habitat

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.980
or what they like to eat?

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.620
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
What they like to eat.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.350
CATHY PEARL: Penguins can eat
up to 13 pounds of fish, krill,

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.520
and squid a day.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.580
By the way, male penguins
spend time sitting on the eggs

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.650
while the females
go out to get fish.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:30.930
Now would you like to
hear more about penguins

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.420
or ask about another animal?

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.130
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
I'm done, thanks.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.550
CATHY PEARL: Sure.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.320
Thanks for talking
to Cool Animal Facts.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.673
Goodbye.

00:05:38.673 --> 00:05:40.590
There's a couple of
things I want to point out

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.850
about this sample dialog.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.340
The first one is how
we started things off.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.400
We said welcome to
Cool Animal Facts.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.650
That's pretty straightforward.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.320
You know what we're
going to be about.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.390
The next thing we did was we
had a very specific question--

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.300
which animal would you
like to know about?

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.930
We didn't say how you doing?

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.062
How can I help you?

00:05:57.062 --> 00:05:59.520
That's going to be way too much
for the user to understand,

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.122
and they won't be successful.

00:06:01.122 --> 00:06:02.580
The other thing I
want to point out

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.410
is, after I finished
telling Jessica

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.895
some facts about
penguins, I asked her,

00:06:06.895 --> 00:06:08.520
do you want to hear
more about penguins

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.280
or ask about another animal?

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.030
And she didn't say
either of those things!

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.620
I told her what to say
and she didn't say it.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.720
But that's OK.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.098
Because she did something that
a person would very naturally do

00:06:19.098 --> 00:06:21.390
to end the conversation
gracefully at that point, which

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.720
is, I'm done, thanks.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.560
So you really need to remember
that people won't necessarily

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.570
say the exact thing
you've said, but they'll

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.270
say something
appropriate for that time

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.040
within the conversation.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.980
I also want to mention we have
a lot of great best practices

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.150
and guidelines on our website
at actions.google.com/design.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.892
This URL will be on the
last slide, as well.

00:06:41.892 --> 00:06:43.350
And we've got great
stuff about how

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.278
to get started, how to
write sample dialogues, all

00:06:46.278 --> 00:06:46.820
these things.

00:06:50.668 --> 00:06:53.210
A lot of times, people ask us,
well, how many of these sample

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.890
dialogues do I need to write?

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:56.570
And there's no
hard and fast rule.

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.880
If your action is more
complex, you should probably

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.780
write some more.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.030
But there's two types you
really want to focus on.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.160
First, there's something
called the happy path.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:06.090
That's when everything
is going great.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.330
Your users are saying
things you can understand.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.890
You're moving the
conversation along,

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.810
kind of like the Cool Animal
Facts one we just did.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.840
But sometimes things
don't go perfectly.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.910
Humans say things in a
really big variety of ways.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.670
And there's going to
be times, especially

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.070
with voice and natural
language understanding, where

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.840
you didn't get what they said.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.280
And you need to get them
gracefully back on track.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.830
So be sure and write some
of those sample dialogues.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.770
I'm going to be talking
a bit more about error

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.940
handling a little later.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:35.300
And in the meantime, I'm going
to hand it off to Jessica

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.460
to talk about greetings
and setting expectations.

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.250
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
So thanks, Cathy.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.060
So Cathy and I, when we
first started this talk,

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.060
we introduced ourselves.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:44.930
And we let you know
what we're going

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:47.000
to be talking about--
conversational actions

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.590
and how to make
them better, or make

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:50.600
them higher quality, at least.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.790
And so setting expectation
is really important

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.810
when your action is first
being used by your users.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.850
Because if we don't
have good expectations,

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.730
users could be confused on
what the possible opportunities

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:02.940
your action is providing.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.840
And so saying expectations
and being very clear

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.020
on what options users have is
really important, especially

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:10.490
when it comes to the greeting.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:12.920
So let's look at some greetings.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.200
This is a fictional
action that we designed

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.680
called Pet Adoption.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.195
In this action,
all it does is you

00:08:18.195 --> 00:08:19.820
could browse different
animals that you

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.820
could adopt if you're looking
to adopt a furry friend.

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:25.640
And so let's look at the
example of a greeting

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.950
that someone had
used prior and we'll

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.870
be pulling this apart
and talking about how

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.130
we can make this better.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.830
So the greeting that
they had was "Hello.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:37.289
Let's find you your
perfect furry friend.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:42.360
To start, say 'find an
animal' or ask a question."

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.730
There's a couple of
things that are not always

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.193
as obvious when it
comes to this greeting

00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:48.360
and how it could get better.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.370
So let's dive into it.

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:54.250
A user might read this or
hear this and think, oh,

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.710
I can ask any question.

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:58.465
And so a user might
say, are poodles smart?

00:08:58.465 --> 00:09:00.090
But again, this action
doesn't actually

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.520
answer those type of questions.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.030
It's all about adoption.

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.148
And it left this user
a little confused.

00:09:05.148 --> 00:09:06.690
And most likely,
this action is going

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.760
to use the default
fallback intent,

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.770
just going, sorry,
what was that--

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:13.720
which isn't a great
experience for users.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.570
So one of the big things, just
like Cathy mentioned earlier,

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.620
when you have in your greeting
a question that's very open,

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.720
it's hard for users
to necessarily know

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.200
what their options are.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.530
And so saying things like
ask a question or how can

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:28.650
I help you could be a little
too vague in the greeting.

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:30.960
Those are great later
in the conversation,

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.980
once the user knows
more about your action

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.800
and what's possible.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.780
Another thing which
is a little strange

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:41.640
is for the user having to say
find an animal when this action

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.818
is only about finding animals.

00:09:43.818 --> 00:09:45.360
So it's an extra
trigger conversation

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.370
that the user has to do,
which is not necessary.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:50.040
And so Kathy and I,
we played with this,

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.830
and we rewrote it
to being "Hello.

00:09:52.830 --> 00:09:54.330
Let's find your perfect friend--

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:55.410
perfect pet.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.725
What sort of animal
are you looking for?"

00:09:57.725 --> 00:10:00.100
And so here it's a little
shorter and it's more explicit.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.560
We're looking for a friend.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.678
What kind of animal
would you like?

00:10:03.678 --> 00:10:05.220
And then, of course,
in the back end,

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.030
we have to be able
to handle this.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.120
And so this idea of an animal--

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.022
we need to handle and manage.

00:10:11.022 --> 00:10:13.230
And so we're going to be
asking about an animal type.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.870
It could be a dog, a cat,
or a different breed.

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.470
And so our action needs
to be able to process that

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.520
and that could be
really challenging

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.360
if we don't have
tools to help us.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.480
And so many developers
use, when it

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.170
comes to actions like
Google, we use Dialogflow.

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.320
Dialogflow will be acting as
our natural language processor.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:33.690
And it does what is
called intent matching.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.410
It gets the user's utterance,
what the user says, and figures

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:39.720
out which one did
that match with best

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.350
to what the developer has put
into Dialogflow as options

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.072
or possible conversation paths.

00:10:45.072 --> 00:10:47.280
And so it does that intent
matching, trying to figure

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.322
out-- the user said this.

00:10:48.322 --> 00:10:49.410
Where does it go to?

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.140
And then, what's really great
is it does entity extraction.

00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:55.680
Which means it could get
different pieces of data

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.530
from the user's utterance
and pass that as a parameter

00:10:58.530 --> 00:10:59.880
to our back end.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.160
And so the idea
of an animal type

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:04.710
could be grabbed
from the user's theme

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:06.900
and passed to us as
a parameter and we

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.240
could query our
database to pick out

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.470
the best animals for this user.

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.470
So to go back to this
particular example,

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:17.010
we have an intent where it's
a possible functionality

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.370
in Dialogflow called
availableAnimal.

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:22.200
And when a user says
the animal we're

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.620
going to be able to
grab that animal type,

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.040
pass it in as a
parameter, and it

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.800
goes to my back end-- to the
available animal function

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.940
that I have in my back end.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:34.640
So that is a really short
kind of simple example

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.360
of a greeting.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.443
Let's talk about one that's
a little meatier, that

00:11:37.443 --> 00:11:40.040
has multiple options that we
want to present to the user.

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.720
So there is an
action called GDG,

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.380
which is Google Developer Group,
that Cathy and I both wrote,

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.250
which was fantastic.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.050
She was amazing with it.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:51.390
And this action was designed
as an open source project.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:55.820
So then these GDGs, which are
community groups that focus

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.960
on Google technologies--
and they're amazing,

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.350
so shout out to GDGs--

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.900
where they could connect
their meet up API

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.300
to provide information like
the events that they have,

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.910
how many members they have,
who are the organizers.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:09.830
And so for this one,
it's going to be

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:12.290
a little bit of a
more meatier greeting

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.010
that we're going to explore.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.290
So Cathy and I
ended up with this.

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.530
"Welcome to GDG San Francisco!

00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:21.110
I can tell you about the
organization, how many members

00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:23.510
we have, or about events.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.040
What would you like
to know about?"

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.260
And with this one, each
option is tied into Dialogflow

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.580
into a particular
intent that I have.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:35.480
And so if a user says about
an organization or GDG,

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.100
it will hit my GDG
intent to Dialogflow.

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.227
And it'll process
information from there.

00:12:40.227 --> 00:12:42.560
So the call of action is
really important in making sure

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.060
that for each shred of dialogue,
there's something connected

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:48.530
that the user could do next.

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.200
Another thing is,
this is written well.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:53.360
But we want to play
with the sound of it.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.040
How do you hear it?

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.350
How does this device
actually speak to the user?

00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:59.060
Because this is the
first time the user

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.590
is going to use this action.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:03.140
We want to make sure
that it's great.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:06.860
So we use SSML, which is
a markup language, where

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.725
you could change the
audio of the Assistant.

00:13:09.725 --> 00:13:10.850
You could change the pitch.

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:13.190
You can make it
talk slower, faster,

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:16.100
add really cool audio
elements into there, too.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.730
It's fantastic.

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:20.570
And so we played with
SSML to make these changes

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:21.413
to the greeting.

00:13:21.413 --> 00:13:23.330
So let's go to the console
and check that out.

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:31.270
OK.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:33.640
So I'm here on my actions
on Google Console.

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:36.640
I am under test
in the simulator.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:40.100
Right here in the middle is the
history of the conversation.

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.650
So you'll see the
back and forth.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:43.775
On the right-hand side,
there's a lot of cool tabs.

00:13:43.775 --> 00:13:45.282
We'll talk about
that in a moment.

00:13:45.282 --> 00:13:46.990
So I'm going to invoke
this action, which

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:49.760
is a action that's
only accessible to me

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.510
at this moment, because
it's not deployed.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:52.810
And it's all about
I/O. And they'll

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.092
have different options there.

00:13:54.092 --> 00:13:55.300
So let me talk to my desktop.

00:14:04.022 --> 00:14:04.980
DESKTOP FEMALE 1: Sure.

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:06.930
Getting the test
version of my test app.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:07.670
[CHIME]

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:10.722
DESKTOP FEMALE 2:
Hello, Google I/O 2019.

00:14:10.722 --> 00:14:12.180
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
So now I'm going

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.810
to say GDG greeting,
which is going

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:16.770
to match my intent in
this particular project

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.003
and give that GDG San
Francisco greeting.

00:14:19.003 --> 00:14:20.670
I would love for you
guys just to listen

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:21.925
to it to hear how it sounds.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.650
DESKTOP FEMALE 2: Welcome
to GDG San Francisco.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:37.490
I can tell you about the
organization, how many members

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:39.800
we have, or about events.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.732
Which would you
like to know about?

00:14:41.732 --> 00:14:43.440
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
That sounds all right.

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.570
But let me show you where
you can make some changes

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.340
and play with SSML.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:49.240
And so here on the
right-hand side,

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.070
we have the request
and response object.

00:14:51.070 --> 00:14:52.660
And then we have an audio tab.

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.290
So let's click there.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:57.050
And here you could see
the text they passed in

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:59.400
and that Dialogflow gives
to actions on Google,

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.720
Google Assistant
will say to the user.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.760
And so I'm going to delete this.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.020
And I'm going to
paste in some SSML

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:09.295
with that same verbiage
with a couple little tweaks.

00:15:09.295 --> 00:15:10.670
So I'm going to
update this so we

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:11.970
can hear how this sounds now.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.180
DESKTOP MALE: Welcome
to GDG San Francisco.

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:25.020
I can tell you about the
organization, how many members

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.922
we have, or about events?

00:15:26.922 --> 00:15:28.380
Which would you
like to know about?

00:15:30.528 --> 00:15:32.570
CATHY PEARL: So we made
a couple of small changes

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.362
here to make the introduction
sound a bit better.

00:15:35.362 --> 00:15:37.070
The first one is that
we put a little bit

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.800
of a break between the
options that were presented

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:40.758
and the question.

00:15:40.758 --> 00:15:42.800
And the reason for that
was that this is probably

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.840
the first time your
user has encountered

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.020
this particular action.

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:47.828
And they're not really
sure what to expect.

00:15:47.828 --> 00:15:49.370
So there's a little
bit of time to do

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:50.730
some cognitive processing.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:52.230
To think, oh, those
are the options,

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:53.493
which one am I going to use--

00:15:53.493 --> 00:15:54.660
before we ask that question.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.660
So we put in a short break.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.270
The other one is that I actually
replaced the question mark

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.837
with a period at that
second end of question.

00:16:01.837 --> 00:16:03.420
Which you might think
is a little odd.

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.760
Why would I do that?

00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.280
That's because a lot of
times when we ask questions,

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.510
we don't always use a rising
intonation, like, how are you?

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.190
A lot of times when
we ask a question,

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.830
we're actually using a
falling intonation, the same

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:17.360
as when we make a statement.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.280
Which one would
you like to know?

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.650
And that made it sound
a little more natural.

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.192
And of course, you're not going
to be able to probably listen

00:16:24.192 --> 00:16:26.730
to every single prompt
within your action,

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:29.090
so you should focus
on a few key places,

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:30.620
such as the initial greeting.

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:33.662
Which again, is going to be the
first thing that the user is

00:16:33.662 --> 00:16:36.120
going to hear and you want to
make a good first impression.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.760
So spend some time
listening to that,

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.300
tweaking it, and seeing
what sounds the best.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.550
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Definitely.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:42.710
Thanks, Cathy.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.450
So of course, when
Cathy and I sat down,

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:45.380
we made these changes.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.713
And we're, like, that's so cool.

00:16:46.713 --> 00:16:49.790
But I don't want to have a
period and my user seeing that.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:51.620
They're going to be,
like, Jessica, mm, mm.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:52.790
That's not right grammar.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:56.000
So first thing I did, of course,
was check our client library

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.380
to see how do we handle this.

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.520
So this is just a code snippet
using our JavaScript client

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.340
library.

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.312
And whenever you make
a simple response,

00:17:04.312 --> 00:17:06.020
you could pass in two
different strings--

00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:07.728
one for the speech
and one for the texts.

00:17:07.728 --> 00:17:09.895
That way you could have a
little bit of a difference

00:17:09.895 --> 00:17:11.720
when it comes to
when it's the audio

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.143
and when it's going to be what
the users are going to see.

00:17:14.143 --> 00:17:16.310
And you could have the
experience slightly different

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:18.349
and unique for the different
types of modalities

00:17:18.349 --> 00:17:20.599
that the user is going to
experience with your action.

00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:24.925
So we talked about the greeting.

00:17:24.925 --> 00:17:26.550
And now the next
thing you want to talk

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:28.830
about is, when
users come back, how

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.947
can you make it even better or
personalized for those users?

00:17:31.947 --> 00:17:34.530
And so we're going to still talk
about the greeting, slightly.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:36.060
But first, I just
want to tell you

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.560
a story about how I met Cathy.

00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.890
Of course, this is exactly
our dialogue that we did.

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:42.090
I went hi.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:42.960
I'm Jessica.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.450
And I'm a developer advocate
for Google Assistant.

00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:47.130
I talk about actions on Google.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.010
Do you want to learn about
our codelabs, our sample

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.730
Actions, or our GitHub samples?

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:54.630
CATHY PEARL: Hm, codelabs.

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.930
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: And
that's exactly how we met.

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:59.780
But you can imagine, the
10th time I meet Cathy,

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:03.660
if I go hi, I'm Jessica,
developer advocate, that's

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:05.520
not very nice to Cathy.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.020
Because it just
shows I didn't even

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.330
remember that I
talked to her before.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.770
That's not cool.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:12.990
And so our actions might
have that same type

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.300
of feeling to our
users, as well.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.850
And so let's talk about creating
custom greetings for users

00:18:17.850 --> 00:18:23.490
that we've seen the first time
and users we see later in time.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:28.090
So this is another
example that we have

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.870
where we have the
property called last seen.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.530
And on the conversation
object, which

00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:34.980
is the object that's being
passed between Google Assistant

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:37.910
Dialogflow and us as a
third party developer,

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:39.430
there is this
property, last seen.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:41.350
And it gives you the
date, time, object

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:44.020
in a string format of the last
time you've seen the user.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.880
So really simply,
you could do, if I've

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.210
seen them before I'm going
to give them the hi again.

00:18:49.210 --> 00:18:51.820
Acknowledge that I've seen
them and potentially change

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:54.070
the greeting to be a little
shorter, and a little more

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.760
simpler.

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.343
And of course, if
we haven't seen them

00:18:56.343 --> 00:18:59.110
before, we could give them
the longer greeting of hello,

00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.900
this is who I am.

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.280
Let me tell you all the things.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.290
And so you could use
something like that

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:03.957
to make your users
feel as though, yeah,

00:19:03.957 --> 00:19:08.290
I acknowledge we've done
this before, which is great.

00:19:08.290 --> 00:19:11.608
So let's go back to the
Pet Adoption example.

00:19:11.608 --> 00:19:13.150
And again, this
one's all about being

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:15.477
able to find your next
furry friend for users.

00:19:15.477 --> 00:19:17.560
And we're going to be
getting a lot of information

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:18.280
from the user.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:22.760
So we could give the
best pet for that user.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:25.270
And so I remember when I was
looking for a furry friend

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:28.810
about six years ago, I
wanted a poodle type of dog.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:31.740
I definitely did not want
one that was a puppy.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:33.050
But I was open to other ones.

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:34.270
And the size was OK.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.480
I was open.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.610
But the one thing that
was consistent in all

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.870
of my searches was my zip code.

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.292
And so let's talk about how
we could offer to the user

00:19:42.292 --> 00:19:44.500
to remember the zip code so
that it's a little easier

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:47.350
for the user next time.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:49.370
So I'll pretend that
we're in the conversation.

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:51.370
This is the first time
we asked for the zip code

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.780
and they give it to us, right?

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:55.640
And then our action
could provide--

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.560
here are the three
furry friends we found.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.330
It has a really
great carousel, shows

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.520
the images of the animals.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.780
And then, in that same
turn of conversation,

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:05.850
there's going to be another
bubble where it says,

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.150
do you want me or should
I remember that zip

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:09.590
code for next time?

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.750
That way the user doesn't
have to provide it again.

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.220
And then, of course, the
user could say yes or no.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:17.800
And so let's see how we
could do this in code.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.950
So this is, again,
in JavaScript.

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:23.050
And I have two intents that
are handling this information.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:25.260
So let's focus on
the top intent.

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.880
Here we have the
available animals.

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.790
And let's pretend that
this gets activated

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.073
once they give me a zip code.

00:20:31.073 --> 00:20:33.240
Then I do that, because
that'll be the last question

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.383
I ask the user.

00:20:34.383 --> 00:20:35.800
And so what I'm
going to do is I'm

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.100
going to get that zip
code as a parameter.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.770
And I'm going to save
it to the conversation

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:44.700
or conv.data, which is
short term data saving

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:45.990
that you could put in.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:48.370
This is not a large
amount of data.

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:51.300
This is something that this
information will be saved only

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:52.950
for that part of
the conversation,

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:54.630
or those turns of
the conversation.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.490
The moment the
user says goodbye.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.580
That gets cleared out.

00:20:57.580 --> 00:20:58.497
It's no longer stored.

00:20:58.497 --> 00:20:59.997
And so it's really
great when you're

00:20:59.997 --> 00:21:02.250
trying to gather different
pieces to generate a query.

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:03.340
You could save it to there.

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:05.690
Then once you've made the
query, then you clear that out.

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:06.750
And so we're going
to save it for here.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:09.210
Because we're going to ask
the user if we want to save

00:21:09.210 --> 00:21:11.232
their zip code for later.

00:21:11.232 --> 00:21:12.690
So we're going to
save it to there.

00:21:12.690 --> 00:21:14.970
Then, of course,
the action gives

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:18.150
the message of the animals
that they could find.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.070
And then it gives
this message of,

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.870
should I remember the zip
code for the next time.

00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:25.040
And we're using confirmations.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.750
And confirmations
are the helper,

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:28.500
where we have multiple
[INAUDIBLE] helpers

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.440
that you could use
that we provide that do

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.970
different functionalities.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:36.870
This one will handle the
yes/no type of questions.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:38.880
And it does all the
variations of sure,

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:43.380
yeah, and tries to suss out
and get an actual yes or no

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.170
from the user.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:46.170
So if the user kind of
gives something vague,

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:49.410
we'll reiterate and make sure
they get an explicit yes or no

00:21:49.410 --> 00:21:51.583
for this yes or no question.

00:21:51.583 --> 00:21:53.250
So that's the first
turn of conversation

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.450
after the user gives a zip code.

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:59.640
Then it goes to the user and
the user says, yes or no.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.370
If the user says yes
or no, it's going

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:03.450
to hit our remember zip intent.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:06.540
And it's going to
pass in confirmation

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:09.310
into that particular function.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:10.900
And if it's true,
if they did say yes,

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.900
what we're going to do
is we're going to get now

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:17.195
from conv.data, which is
short term saving of data,

00:22:17.195 --> 00:22:18.570
we're going to
grab that zip code

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:21.800
and now add it to
conv.user.storage.

00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.490
That is long term
storage where it's

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:27.020
going to be saved over
multiple conversations.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:30.030
And so if I talk to Cathy
once, and I save her zip code,

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:32.040
the next time I talk to
Cathy in three weeks,

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.760
I will still have her zip code.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.328
So this is long term saving.

00:22:35.328 --> 00:22:37.620
And then, of course, I'm
going to acknowledge the user,

00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:40.450
saying, OK, I'll remember
that and continue

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:42.085
in the conversation.

00:22:42.085 --> 00:22:43.460
And of course, we
don't to forget

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.820
that if the user says
no or they decline,

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.760
we will acknowledge
that, say no worries,

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.240
and then continue the
conversation, as well.

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:53.700
So just want to note that
whenever you're accessing user

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:57.270
storage, if you are in countries
that have regulations that

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:01.080
require developers to obtain
consent when obtaining user

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.313
information, you must use
the confirmation helper

00:23:04.313 --> 00:23:05.230
when it comes to that.

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:06.480
So if you operate in
these countries that

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:08.563
have these restrictions,
please take note of that.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:13.700
So helpers-- confirmation
is one of them.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.280
And we provide other ways
that you can get information

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.220
from the user that's
really common.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:22.370
For me, I don't necessarily want
to ask the user for their zip

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:23.000
code raw.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.980
I want to be able to
ask it using place.

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.020
That way we can
get their location.

00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.540
You can also get
other common things

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:32.210
like their name, their
photo, their email

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:35.630
by using permission, and then
other information like Google

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:38.390
Sign In where you can have them
log into your account, as well.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.610
So helpers are ways
that we provide

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:42.818
and where you can get
information from the user

00:23:42.818 --> 00:23:44.360
and Google Assistant
will temporarily

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:47.840
take control of the conversation
to handle that request, as

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.650
well.

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.420
So I definitely
highly recommend using

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.210
these to get data from the
user, especially when it

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:53.900
comes to names.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:56.268
Because we all spell
names slightly different.

00:23:56.268 --> 00:23:58.310
That way you can get the
actual name of the user.

00:24:01.422 --> 00:24:02.380
CATHY PEARL: All right.

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.990
So earlier I talked a bit
about when things maybe

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:07.510
don't go quite right, when
somebody says something

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:10.310
that you didn't expect and
there's some sort of error.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.470
Now humans have
misunderstandings all the time,

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.130
where we mishear each other
or misunderstand each other.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:16.850
But we don't call
those hiccups errors.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:19.058
I don't say, oh, I was
talking to Jessica last night.

00:24:19.058 --> 00:24:20.200
And we had three errors.

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:22.120
Because we're so
good at repairing

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.800
the conversation gracefully.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.510
And you can apply
that same principle

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:27.280
to help your users
get back on track when

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.382
they stumble in your action.

00:24:30.382 --> 00:24:32.090
Hey, Jessica, what
did you do last night?

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.280
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: I
went to [? Abuelita. ?]

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:33.460
CATHY PEARL: Sorry.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:34.240
You went where?

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.020
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
[? Abuelitas. ?]

00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:36.430
CATHY PEARL: Oh,
great restaurant.

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.930
See?

00:24:36.930 --> 00:24:38.230
Right there we had an error.

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:39.520
But we did a repair.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.390
We quickly got back on track.

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:43.910
And again, if you follow
some of these best practices,

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:46.640
your actions can be
that smooth, as well.

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.210
Let's look at an example using
a sample dialogue of, again,

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:52.450
a fake action we designed
called Cathy's Chocolate Shop

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:55.927
where maybe we didn't handle
the error case very well.

00:24:55.927 --> 00:24:57.010
Will you be my user again?

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:57.580
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
Of course, Cathy.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.538
CATHY PEARL: All right.

00:24:58.538 --> 00:24:59.420
Let's go.

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:00.670
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: OK, Google.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:02.462
Talk to Cathy's Chocolate Shop.

00:25:02.462 --> 00:25:04.420
CATHY PEARL: Welcome to
Cathy's Chocolate Shop.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.040
I can give you
chocolate recipes,

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.770
tell you what chocolate
fact, or play a trivia game.

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:10.970
Which would you like?

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:13.648
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Where--
where can I buy your chocolates?

00:25:13.648 --> 00:25:14.440
CATHY PEARL: Sorry.

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.790
I can't understand the command.

00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:17.410
Please say again.

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:19.120
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
Store locations.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:19.600
CATHY PEARL: Sorry.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.892
I can't understand the command.

00:25:20.892 --> 00:25:22.710
Please say again.

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:23.690
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Ah.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:24.190
Ah.

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:25.815
CATHY PEARL: Now you
might be thinking,

00:25:25.815 --> 00:25:27.800
I would never write
a prompt like that.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.580
But believe me, I got this from
a real life example out there.

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:32.530
So never say never.

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:35.170
What you really need to do here
is get people back on track

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:39.070
by providing them information
that's relevant right now.

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:41.560
Context sensitive
error handling is

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.000
key to building a
successful action.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
So let's look at maybe
how we could have handled

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.750
this a little bit better.

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:50.420
Let's try this again.

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:51.895
Welcome to Cathy's
Chocolate Shop.

00:25:51.895 --> 00:25:53.270
I can give you
chocolate recipes,

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:55.312
tell you a chocolate fact,
or play a trivia game.

00:25:55.312 --> 00:25:57.670
Which would you like?

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:59.795
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Where
can I buy your chocolates?

00:25:59.795 --> 00:26:02.087
CATHY PEARL: I have chocolate
recipes, chocolate facts,

00:26:02.087 --> 00:26:02.840
and a trivia game.

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:04.710
Which one would you like?

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:07.050
So here all we've done is
restate the options that

00:26:07.050 --> 00:26:08.793
are available at that time.

00:26:08.793 --> 00:26:10.460
And most of the time
something like this

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:15.830
is going to get people on track
and back on their merry way.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:18.628
There's another type of
error prompt you can do,

00:26:18.628 --> 00:26:20.420
which is similar, but
it's a little faster.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.220
It's called a rapid reprompt.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.830
And that works great if you've
only got maybe one or two types

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.250
of things you're asking for.

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:29.970
So let's hear how
that one sounds.

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:31.650
Welcome to Cathy's
Chocolate Shop.

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:33.910
Which would you like?

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.345
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
How about a recipe?

00:26:36.345 --> 00:26:37.470
CATHY PEARL: Sure, recipes.

00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:40.108
Do you prefer dark
chocolate or milk chocolate?

00:26:40.108 --> 00:26:41.650
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
Oh, well, I like--

00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:43.338
65% is good.

00:26:43.338 --> 00:26:44.130
CATHY PEARL: Sorry.

00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.240
Do you prefer dark
chocolate or milk chocolate?

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.970
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Ah, dark.

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:49.440
CATHY PEARL: So
here, again, people

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.340
say things in a huge
variety of ways.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:52.350
And if you're a
big chocolate fan,

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.683
you might want to talk about
the percentage of chocolate

00:26:54.683 --> 00:26:55.290
that you like.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:57.480
But maybe my action
doesn't understand that.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.190
So I can quickly get
them back on track

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.740
with just dark or milk.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.950
Another thing that you can do
to be really nice to your users

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.110
is to acknowledge when there
are things that you can't do.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:10.330
We humans long to be understood.

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:12.330
It is very important to us.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.120
Imagine I went to a hotel and
I'm talking to the concierge,

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.700
and I say, hey, can
you rent me a car?

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:19.780
And they say, I
don't understand.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:21.750
Would you like me to
make dinner reservations?

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.547
I'd be like, no, can
you rent me a car?

00:27:23.547 --> 00:27:24.880
It wouldn't make a lot of sense.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.090
What they're really more
likely to say is, sorry.

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:29.070
I can't right you a car.

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.960
Are you interested in
dinner reservations?

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.420
So you should do something
like that for your actions.

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:35.940
Let's see what that sounds like.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.500
Welcome to Cathy's
chocolate shop.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.335
Which would you like?

00:27:39.335 --> 00:27:41.460
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Where
can I buy your chocolates?

00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.252
CATHY PEARL: Sorry.

00:27:42.252 --> 00:27:44.500
I'm not able to provide
store locations yet.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:47.595
You can find locations on our
website, Cathy.chocolate.com.

00:27:47.595 --> 00:27:49.960
Can I help with anything else?

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.020
So again, it was a very
explicit acknowledgment.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.360
We didn't just say
I can't do that.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.690
We said I can't do
store locations.

00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:59.940
This also saves your user
a lot of frustration.

00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.710
Because you've got
to remember, when

00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:04.830
somebody comes into your action
and they ask for something

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:07.650
that you don't have,
they don't necessarily

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:10.575
know-- is it that your
action doesn't do that,

00:28:10.575 --> 00:28:11.700
or did I just say it wrong?

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.017
Did they use the wrong keyword?

00:28:13.017 --> 00:28:14.100
How about store locations?

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:15.240
How about where can I buy?

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:16.600
How about where are your stores?

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.420
They're going to be banging
their head against the wall,

00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:19.837
thinking I don't
have the keyword.

00:28:19.837 --> 00:28:21.030
I've got to keep trying.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:24.000
When you stop and say,
hey, I can't do that thing,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.578
then they know, oh, OK.

00:28:25.578 --> 00:28:27.120
And they can move
on with their lives

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.950
and stop being so frustrated.

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:32.440
And the last thing I want
to say about error handling

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.720
is called escalated error.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:37.812
Sometimes when you give them
that first error prompt,

00:28:37.812 --> 00:28:40.270
it's not going to give them
all the information they really

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:40.780
need.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.030
Most of the time it's going
to get them back on track.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:45.610
But if they have another
error right away,

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:48.268
it probably means you didn't
give them enough information.

00:28:48.268 --> 00:28:50.060
So you want to give
them a bit more detail.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.435
So let's see how
that one sounds.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:55.087
OK, dark.

00:28:55.087 --> 00:28:56.920
Are you interested in
a recipe that's quick,

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.540
or do you have more time?

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:00.415
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Well,
I mean, my partner's

00:29:00.415 --> 00:29:02.322
birthday's tomorrow.

00:29:02.322 --> 00:29:03.280
CATHY PEARL: Oh, sorry.

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.400
Was that a quick recipe
or something longer?

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.950
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: I mean,
how long is it going to take?

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:10.540
CATHY PEARL: You can either
choose something quick, which

00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.580
is under 30 minutes,
or longer, which could

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.320
be 30 minutes to overnight?

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.740
Which one would you like?

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.800
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
30 minutes then.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.080
CATHY PEARL: So
again, when Jessica

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.120
had an error the second
time, I obviously

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.410
wasn't helping her enough.

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:25.243
She needed to know,
well, what the heck does

00:29:25.243 --> 00:29:27.290
quick mean before she
could make a decision.

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:29.207
So that's when you want
to get into a slightly

00:29:29.207 --> 00:29:31.170
longer prompt with a bit
more information that

00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:33.110
will get them back on track.

00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:35.290
And check out the
Google I/O 2019 action

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:37.780
to hear some good examples
of context sensitive error

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:40.190
handling.

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:44.470
I want to say something a
little bit about persona.

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:47.620
When somebody hears a
voice or hears your action,

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.690
within the first second
they have already

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:52.120
made a mental model
of who is talking.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.755
It's just something we do
as humans all the time.

00:29:54.755 --> 00:29:56.380
So you really want
to get ahead of that

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:59.420
and define the persona or the
personality of your action

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:00.892
so they don't do it for you.

00:30:00.892 --> 00:30:03.100
Now, this talk is not going
to get deep into persona.

00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:04.900
I highly recommend
last year's talk

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.832
by Wally Brill,
"Creating A Persona,

00:30:06.832 --> 00:30:08.290
What Does Your
Product Sound Like?"

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:09.860
He gets into great detail there.

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.500
But the one thing I
do want to mention

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.300
is if you're working
on your action,

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:15.100
building it in
Dialogflow, how do

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.200
you know you're still
following the guidelines

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.700
you set for your persona?

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.550
So I'm going to take an
example from Wally's talk,

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:23.800
that you're making
an airline action.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:26.410
And imagine that you've
defined your persona

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.450
to be pretty casual,
pretty friendly.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:30.130
And you've gotten
to the point where

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:31.870
you're writing a
prompt when you can't

00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:33.960
find the user's reservation.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.220
And you might write
something like this.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.440
I'm sorry, but I am unable
to find your reservation.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:42.472
So let's hear what that actually
sounds like in the console.

00:30:42.472 --> 00:30:43.430
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Yep.

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:45.138
So we're going to go
back to the console.

00:30:45.138 --> 00:30:46.790
I've refreshed my action.

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:48.210
It's the same I/O action.

00:30:48.210 --> 00:30:49.562
So let's start it.

00:30:49.562 --> 00:30:50.520
DESKTOP FEMALE 1: Sure.

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:52.890
Here's the test
version of my test app.

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:53.430
[CHIME]

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:54.930
DESKTOP FEMALE 2:
Hello there again.

00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:55.430
See?

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:57.570
I remembered that
we've talked before.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:59.513
Don't you feel seen?

00:30:59.513 --> 00:31:00.430
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: OK.

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.820
So let me do reservation.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.582
So I can get that.

00:31:03.582 --> 00:31:05.040
DESKTOP FEMALE 2:
I am sorry, but I

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:07.217
am unable to find
your reservation.

00:31:07.217 --> 00:31:08.800
CATHY PEARL: I know
it's a bit subtle,

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.740
but to me, that just
doesn't sound very good.

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:12.870
It's really formal and stiff.

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:13.650
It's long.

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:15.760
It doesn't use a contraction.

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:18.640
And it might be how we
would write something.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:20.353
But when you say
it out loud, it's

00:31:20.353 --> 00:31:22.770
not the way I would say it,
or a friendly customer service

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:23.560
agent.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.610
So let's tweak it a bit.

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:26.068
Let's make it a
little bit shorter.

00:31:26.068 --> 00:31:29.403
Let's put in a contraction,
and hear how this sounds.

00:31:29.403 --> 00:31:31.320
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: So
let's update and listen.

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.047
DESKTOP MALE: Sorry, but I
can't find your reservation.

00:31:34.047 --> 00:31:35.880
CATHY PEARL: That sounds
a lot better to me.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.040
Again, it's a kind
of a subtle change.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.335
But to me, that's much more
how I would naturally say it.

00:31:41.335 --> 00:31:42.960
As we mentioned
before, you're probably

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.810
not going to get the chance to
listen to every single prompt

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:47.410
in your action, and that's OK.

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:49.750
But you should focus on
some of the key areas,

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:52.890
such as your initial
prompt, and also, maybe,

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:56.070
places where there might be some
emotional reaction going on.

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:59.700
Here you've just told your
poor user that you cannot find

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.440
their airline reservation.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.148
They're probably going
to be a bit upset.

00:32:03.148 --> 00:32:04.732
So those are the
kinds of places where

00:32:04.732 --> 00:32:07.320
you'll want to spend some extra
time thinking about, listening

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:09.210
to, and designing your prompts.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:13.365
And to finish this
off, Jessica is

00:32:13.365 --> 00:32:15.740
going to talk about how to
improve your action by looking

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:16.525
at the logs.

00:32:16.525 --> 00:32:17.900
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
Thanks, Cathy.

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:20.108
So we spent a lot of time
talking about conversation.

00:32:20.108 --> 00:32:23.900
And I hope you do that and build
your conversation design really

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:24.400
well.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.817
And then after you
do that, you're

00:32:25.817 --> 00:32:26.960
going to build your action.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.533
And then you're going to
put it for production.

00:32:29.533 --> 00:32:30.950
And once you put
it in production,

00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:35.088
your action is available on
over one billion devices.

00:32:35.088 --> 00:32:37.380
And something that's really
cool about Google Assistant

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:39.650
is that our actions,
once they're

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:41.690
deployed on our
production level,

00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:43.840
there's no downloading
needed for the user.

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.340
The user could just
simply say, hey, Google,

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.218
talk to, and then the action's
name, which is fantastic.

00:32:49.218 --> 00:32:51.260
So most likely, you'll
get some users right away,

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.910
because people will be
finding your action.

00:32:54.910 --> 00:32:57.380
So I'm going to talk about
one particular thing.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.700
I want to highlight,
in Dialogflow,

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.470
there are three
different components

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:03.270
that I highly recommend
for developers

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:06.630
to use after your action's
deployed to look into so you

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:08.250
can make your action better.

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:10.200
First thing is training.

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.960
Next one is history,
and then analytics.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.522
Each of these are fantastic.

00:33:14.522 --> 00:33:16.230
But today we're going
to go over training

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:17.720
and talk more about that.

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.310
And so this is a page
view of a training.

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:23.220
And here you can actually see
the different conversations

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.440
you have with users.

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:26.520
And of course, these
logs do not obtain

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:29.420
or have any identifying
information about users.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.170
They're just the raw
utterances that users

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:32.500
have with your action.

00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.860
So let's click on one
and see what's in there.

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:40.180
So this is an interaction that
a user had with my action.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.490
And let's walk through
this interaction.

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:45.580
So the first thing that
happens is the Google Assistant

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.490
triggers my welcome intent,
which my action does.

00:33:48.490 --> 00:33:50.890
Welcome to GDG San Francisco.

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:54.220
Then after that,
the user said this.

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:57.160
How many peeps do you have?

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:59.780
Which my action did
not know what to do.

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:01.870
And so I hit my fallback intent.

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:05.590
And so it gave a kind of
a generic statement of,

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:07.330
like, sorry, what
was that, which isn't

00:34:07.330 --> 00:34:09.320
a good experience for the user.

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.540
And most likely,
this term peeps is

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:14.633
slang in English, where it
usually refers to people.

00:34:14.633 --> 00:34:16.300
And so I'm assuming
that this user meant

00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:17.590
how many members do you have?

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:19.190
But they said it
slightly different.

00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:21.020
And I need to take
into account for that.

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.853
And so what I could do
is I could Click next

00:34:22.853 --> 00:34:24.940
to the intents, and
here it gives me

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.790
a list of all the
intents I currently have.

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:29.860
And there I could choose
to see which intent

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:31.780
does it best match with
that the user should

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:33.489
be able to get in return.

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:35.710
This one, in particular,
is my members' intent.

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:37.060
So I click on that.

00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:39.850
And now, the next
time a user says

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:43.270
how many peeps do you have,
it's going to trigger my member

00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:45.070
intent for that user.

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:47.080
When you do this, what
happens in the back end

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.020
is Dialogflow grabs
that user utterance-- so

00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:50.770
how many peeps do you
have-- and adds that

00:34:50.770 --> 00:34:52.830
to the intent training phrases.

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:55.120
So now it's included
in that model for you,

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.313
which is fantastic.

00:34:56.313 --> 00:34:57.730
And of course,
there's going to be

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:00.880
times where you're going to
have interaction that you didn't

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:02.630
necessarily expect.

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:05.120
And so here you could
still click on that.

00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:07.410
And there's an option on the
bottom called Create New.

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:09.640
And here you can
create a new intent.

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.360
Name it whenever
you want it to be.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:15.370
So for the example of the
chocolate store locations,

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.680
you could create that
intent, grab that utterance,

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:21.310
and then go to the intense
portion in Dialogflow,

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:24.178
and then give a response there
and have that bit built out.

00:35:24.178 --> 00:35:25.720
And so you can add
that functionality

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:29.750
while you're going through
your logs, which is great.

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:31.980
So we talked a lot
about many things.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.353
So let's do a quick recap.

00:35:34.353 --> 00:35:36.520
CATHY PEARL: So first we
learned how to get started,

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:38.050
sample dialogues.

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:39.110
Write them down.

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:40.110
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Yeah.

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:41.910
And of course, you want
to say it out loud.

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:44.497
So you want to read all
your sample dialog out loud.

00:35:44.497 --> 00:35:46.080
And then, of course,
you want to spend

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:48.360
some time saying expectations
and the greetings

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:49.242
for your users.

00:35:49.242 --> 00:35:50.700
And then, of course,
you want to be

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.530
able to customize those
greetings for users

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.230
who come back for your action.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:57.180
And then don't forget to
personalize the experience

00:35:57.180 --> 00:35:58.983
by using helper methods.

00:35:58.983 --> 00:36:01.650
CATHY PEARL: We also learned how
to get users back on track when

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:04.560
they say things your action
didn't expect and repair

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:06.180
the conversation gracefully.

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.170
Right, Jessica?

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:08.670
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
Hi, I'm Jessica.

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:09.240
CATHY PEARL: Sorry.

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.950
Did you hear the part
about the air handling?

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:11.280
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: I did.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:11.780
Yeah.

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:12.900
CATHY PEARL: All right.

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.850
Another thing you can
do is to double check

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:17.010
that you're building
according to the spec you set

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:18.090
for your persona.

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:20.090
And you can do that by
listening to your prompts

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:21.905
out loud throughout
the building process.

00:36:21.905 --> 00:36:23.280
JESSICA EARLY-CHA:
And of course,

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.180
quantifying them
using SSML, so you

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:27.900
could create really rich
experience for your users.

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:31.020
And then finally, once your
actions are out for production,

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:35.275
go through the logs so you can
make your action even better.

00:36:35.275 --> 00:36:37.650
CATHY PEARL: If you want to
get started building actions,

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:39.790
we've got a lot of
great resources for you.

00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:42.370
There's Actions on Google
Docs, conversation design best

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:44.590
practices, and of
course, codelabs

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:46.930
to see examples of things
people have already built.

00:36:46.930 --> 00:36:47.830
Thank you so much.

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:49.038
JESSICA EARLY-CHA: Thank you.

00:36:49.038 --> 00:36:51.390
