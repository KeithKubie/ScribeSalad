00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:08.462
(lively piano music)

00:00:09.506 --> 00:00:12.424
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.424 --> 00:00:13.721
Bipedal.

00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:14.986
Naked.

00:00:14.986 --> 00:00:16.153
Large-brained.

00:00:17.606 --> 00:00:21.710
Long the master of fire,
tools, and language.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.127
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.974 --> 00:00:29.269
Aware that death is inevitable.

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.352
Yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:34.075
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.947 --> 00:00:37.556
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:39.639
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.985 --> 00:00:42.819
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:44.986
understanding of the past.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:50.242
CARTA brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:53.287
to exchange insights on who we are,

00:00:53.287 --> 00:00:54.954
and how we got here.

00:00:56.308 --> 00:00:58.027
An exploration made possible

00:00:58.027 --> 00:01:01.110
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:15.223 --> 00:01:17.890
(uptempo music)

00:01:20.602 --> 00:01:23.185
(upbeat music)

00:01:35.434 --> 00:01:38.584
- My job at the beginning at
least is a little simplified

00:01:38.584 --> 00:01:41.590
because of the talks
you've heard from already

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.757
especially from Rick and from Wieland.

00:01:45.674 --> 00:01:47.050
As you all are well aware,

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.036
the human brain is the
largest among primates,

00:01:50.036 --> 00:01:51.241
living primates,

00:01:51.241 --> 00:01:52.110
but I just wanted to emphasize

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.952
it's not the largest mammal brain.

00:01:54.952 --> 00:01:57.538
Elephants and whales and
cetaceans have larger

00:01:57.538 --> 00:02:00.534
and also more highly
folded cerebral cortices.

00:02:00.534 --> 00:02:03.690
But in terms of brain number
in the cerebral cortex,

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.164
neuron number, humans have
the largest total number.

00:02:07.164 --> 00:02:10.778
And so, my area of interest
similar to Wieland's is

00:02:10.778 --> 00:02:13.483
one of the more obvious
features of human brain

00:02:13.483 --> 00:02:15.744
is its size and the number of cells.

00:02:15.744 --> 00:02:17.595
and that brings us right to the issue of

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:18.920
where they all come from

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.187
which has been as you hear

00:02:20.187 --> 00:02:22.774
a sort of an interesting
problem or a central problem

00:02:22.774 --> 00:02:24.024
for many of us.

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.710
The developmental stages are clearly

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.047
where we'll find the
answer to how that happens

00:02:29.047 --> 00:02:32.261
and in my lab we've been looking
at human brain development

00:02:32.261 --> 00:02:34.238
through the second trimester

00:02:34.238 --> 00:02:36.991
which is when most cortical
neurons are developed.

00:02:36.991 --> 00:02:40.091
And a cross-section through
the developing cortex

00:02:40.091 --> 00:02:41.665
looks very different
in humans than it does

00:02:41.665 --> 00:02:44.283
for example in mouse
which is the animal system

00:02:44.283 --> 00:02:47.220
that most neuroscientists
have used to study

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.348
early stages of brain development.

00:02:49.348 --> 00:02:50.912
So this is the cross-section of the mouse

00:02:50.912 --> 00:02:53.091
and you heard from Wieland
very beautifully how there are

00:02:53.091 --> 00:02:55.341
apical progenitors which
we call radial glia

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:57.717
shown here in red marked by Sox2,

00:02:57.717 --> 00:03:00.228
one of the transcription
factors that they express.

00:03:00.228 --> 00:03:01.775
And their daughter cells are these

00:03:01.775 --> 00:03:03.809
intermediate progenitors that line up

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.086
right above them in the
subventricular zone.

00:03:06.086 --> 00:03:07.152
And the beginning, the middle

00:03:07.152 --> 00:03:08.830
and the end of neurogenesis in the mouse

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.475
looks just like that.

00:03:10.475 --> 00:03:12.635
In the human it starts out very similarly.

00:03:12.635 --> 00:03:13.913
There are radial glial cells

00:03:13.913 --> 00:03:17.287
and intermediate progenitors
forming these two layers

00:03:17.287 --> 00:03:20.140
but then very rapidly
the subventricular zone

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.875
undergoes this enormous
expansion that you've heard about

00:03:22.875 --> 00:03:25.823
and becomes an outer
subventricular zone shown here.

00:03:25.823 --> 00:03:27.060
And all of these colors represent

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.239
cells that are cycling.

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.154
They're producing daughter cells.

00:03:30.154 --> 00:03:32.107
You may notice the
ventricular zone at this stage

00:03:32.107 --> 00:03:33.564
becomes very small.

00:03:33.564 --> 00:03:36.476
And so the majority of cortical
neurons at these stages

00:03:36.476 --> 00:03:38.839
almost certainly are
coming from this zone,

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:40.746
not from the ventricular zone.

00:03:40.746 --> 00:03:42.681
And moreover this isn't
the end of neurogenesis,

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:45.479
this is halfway through gestation week 17,

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:47.441
when the middle layers are being formed.

00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:49.055
So the middle and upper cortical layers

00:03:49.055 --> 00:03:50.878
are presumably being generated

00:03:50.878 --> 00:03:54.082
by the cells in this
outer subventricular zone.

00:03:54.082 --> 00:03:55.665
But the actual nature of those progenitors

00:03:55.665 --> 00:03:57.562
really hadn't been studied,

00:03:57.562 --> 00:04:00.153
and so we looked at it
in a variety of ways.

00:04:00.153 --> 00:04:02.862
First I want to show you
how dynamic this area is.

00:04:02.862 --> 00:04:03.752
In this case we're looking

00:04:03.752 --> 00:04:06.102
at the outer subventricular
zone in a slice culture

00:04:06.102 --> 00:04:10.007
where we've labeled just the
progenitor cells in green.

00:04:10.007 --> 00:04:11.602
So there are neurons that you don't see

00:04:11.602 --> 00:04:14.176
but the progenitors are highly dynamic.

00:04:14.176 --> 00:04:15.918
And we look at them more carefully we find

00:04:15.918 --> 00:04:18.039
two classes and one that
I really wanna emphasize

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.981
is this one.

00:04:18.981 --> 00:04:21.096
It's a radial glia-like cell.

00:04:21.096 --> 00:04:23.806
It has this process that
goes up to the pial surface

00:04:23.806 --> 00:04:25.316
which is the basal fiber

00:04:25.316 --> 00:04:28.126
but it doesn't have an apical
contact with the ventricle,

00:04:28.126 --> 00:04:29.474
the way the epithelial cells

00:04:29.474 --> 00:04:32.783
or the ventricular apical radial glia do.

00:04:32.783 --> 00:04:34.540
Otherwise it looks just
like a radial glial cell.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.745
It stains with all the markers

00:04:35.745 --> 00:04:38.647
that you normally would
see in radial glial cells,

00:04:38.647 --> 00:04:40.901
and if you backfill the
surface of the cortex

00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:44.157
with a label like this, the Dil crystal,

00:04:44.157 --> 00:04:45.802
it fills the fibers of these cells

00:04:45.802 --> 00:04:50.235
that end in cell bodies in
the outer subventricular zone.

00:04:50.235 --> 00:04:51.902
These cells hadn't been
described at the time

00:04:51.902 --> 00:04:54.331
and so we call them outer subventricular

00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:57.176
radial glial like cells or oRG cells,

00:04:57.176 --> 00:04:59.654
and as you heard Wieland
calls them basal radial glial.

00:04:59.654 --> 00:05:01.384
They're the same cell type

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:02.705
and they're enriched it turns out

00:05:02.705 --> 00:05:05.205
in the human developing brain.

00:05:06.367 --> 00:05:08.166
Now we've looked at them dynamically

00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:11.654
and we're struck by a behavior
that hadn't been seen before.

00:05:11.654 --> 00:05:14.559
These are four of the
cells that are labeled

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:16.476
in one slice of cortex.

00:05:17.886 --> 00:05:20.405
And as they divide you may notice how they

00:05:20.405 --> 00:05:21.620
sort of jump and divide,

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.517
and if you didn't notice
it in those images

00:05:23.517 --> 00:05:26.424
I hope you'll be able to
see it in this single cell.

00:05:26.424 --> 00:05:28.343
Because as they go through M-phase,

00:05:28.343 --> 00:05:31.247
the actual cytokinesis
stage when they divide,

00:05:31.247 --> 00:05:34.280
they jump first and then
undergo this cell division

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.720
or cytokinesis.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.033
Very distinctive behavior that
hadn't been described before

00:05:38.033 --> 00:05:42.884
and so we called it mitotic
somal translocation, MST.

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:45.144
And it was one of the defining
features of these cells

00:05:45.144 --> 00:05:46.843
because there were no specific markers

00:05:46.843 --> 00:05:48.393
that we could use to distinguish them

00:05:48.393 --> 00:05:51.846
from the traditional
ventricular radial glia.

00:05:51.846 --> 00:05:53.239
But when we look for them in other species

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:54.580
and this is in the mouse,

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.226
we found them there as well.

00:05:56.226 --> 00:05:58.296
And if you watch this cell,

00:05:58.296 --> 00:06:02.247
it's what we call now a mouse
outer radial glial cell.

00:06:02.247 --> 00:06:04.669
And you see it goes through a little jump,

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:06.856
much more modest than the human cells.

00:06:06.856 --> 00:06:07.996
It has this basal fiber

00:06:07.996 --> 00:06:10.452
and it's located in
the subventricular zone

00:06:10.452 --> 00:06:13.252
if the mouse had a subventricular zone.

00:06:13.252 --> 00:06:15.808
So these cells are present
in small numbers in the mouse

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:18.894
and are usually expanded in primates

00:06:18.894 --> 00:06:21.179
and especially in humans.

00:06:21.179 --> 00:06:22.143
Are they neurogenic?

00:06:22.143 --> 00:06:23.977
Do they actually make neurons?

00:06:23.977 --> 00:06:26.000
And to test that we actually dissociated

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.416
cells from the progenitor zones,

00:06:28.416 --> 00:06:30.729
labeled them with a virus marker

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:32.981
that actually just infected progenitors,

00:06:32.981 --> 00:06:34.914
and then put a single progenitor in each

00:06:34.914 --> 00:06:36.173
of multiwell plates.

00:06:36.173 --> 00:06:37.478
And here's an example of a single one

00:06:37.478 --> 00:06:39.521
of the progenitors in this well,

00:06:39.521 --> 00:06:41.843
and a higher magnification view is there.

00:06:41.843 --> 00:06:43.945
And then we time-lapse imaged the behavior

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:46.144
and you could identify
the outer radial glia

00:06:46.144 --> 00:06:47.315
by their first division.

00:06:47.315 --> 00:06:48.709
They put out a primary process

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:51.496
just like they would in situ,

00:06:51.496 --> 00:06:52.781
and then they jumped and divided

00:06:52.781 --> 00:06:55.104
and that made that cell classified

00:06:55.104 --> 00:06:56.856
as an outer radial glia.

00:06:56.856 --> 00:06:58.159
And we had other cells that rounded up

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:00.053
and divided, those were the
intermediate progenitors

00:07:00.053 --> 00:07:02.428
and we looked seven weeks
later and culture it,

00:07:02.428 --> 00:07:03.700
what the clones were like.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.297
What does a single outer radial glial cell

00:07:06.297 --> 00:07:09.011
actually produce at least in vitro?

00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:11.065
And the answer was really surprising.

00:07:11.065 --> 00:07:12.857
The cell I just showed
you after seven weeks

00:07:12.857 --> 00:07:15.800
had produced a clone of at least 700 cells

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.257
which included neurons of both

00:07:17.257 --> 00:07:19.678
deeper and upper cortical layers.

00:07:19.678 --> 00:07:21.228
And in this clone there were no astrocytes

00:07:21.228 --> 00:07:23.066
and some of the clones
that were additionally

00:07:23.066 --> 00:07:25.212
astrocytes plus neurons.

00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:28.244
And this is an enormous output of cells.

00:07:28.244 --> 00:07:29.432
If we do the same experiment

00:07:29.432 --> 00:07:31.367
with the radial glial cell in a mouse,

00:07:31.367 --> 00:07:34.902
we get 20 to 40 cells after a month or so.

00:07:34.902 --> 00:07:37.890
So, 700 to 1,000 cells from a single

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.141
outer radial glial cell
I think underscores

00:07:40.141 --> 00:07:43.891
how enormously proliferative
these cells are.

00:07:44.778 --> 00:07:46.812
And so, it helps support this model

00:07:46.812 --> 00:07:48.503
which is still a work in progress

00:07:48.503 --> 00:07:49.629
of what we think makes the human

00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:52.379
cortical development
distinct say from the mouse.

00:07:52.379 --> 00:07:55.604
And in the ventricular and
subventricular zone shown here

00:07:55.604 --> 00:07:59.122
we think cells in the human
behave very much like the mouse,

00:07:59.122 --> 00:08:01.110
but what makes the human so distinct

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:02.530
is the outer subventricular zone

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:04.843
which is filled with
these outer radial glia

00:08:04.843 --> 00:08:05.834
that are born initially

00:08:05.834 --> 00:08:07.914
from the ventricular zone and move away.

00:08:07.914 --> 00:08:10.196
And they go through these
multiple self-renewing

00:08:10.196 --> 00:08:13.339
asymmetrical divisions
producing these daughters,

00:08:13.339 --> 00:08:14.705
shown here in green,

00:08:14.705 --> 00:08:18.153
which are transit
amplifying progenitor cells.

00:08:18.153 --> 00:08:21.130
And they actually divide
symmetrically at least twice.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.063
We know they do that more than once

00:08:23.063 --> 00:08:24.729
producing clones of cells

00:08:24.729 --> 00:08:26.023
which then have the same birth date

00:08:26.023 --> 00:08:28.717
and migrate therefore to
the same cortical layer.

00:08:28.717 --> 00:08:31.685
And over time one of these
oRG cells will produce

00:08:31.685 --> 00:08:33.232
multiple clones of cells

00:08:33.232 --> 00:08:35.284
in multiple different layers.

00:08:35.284 --> 00:08:38.345
And the radial fibers
support neuronal migration

00:08:38.345 --> 00:08:40.433
so that allows an increase
in the cortical size

00:08:40.433 --> 00:08:42.602
tangentially as well as radially.

00:08:42.602 --> 00:08:44.175
So we think the cell is very important

00:08:44.175 --> 00:08:46.201
for cortical expansion

00:08:46.201 --> 00:08:48.169
both developmentally as shown here

00:08:48.169 --> 00:08:51.571
and also in evolutionary terms.

00:08:51.571 --> 00:08:53.451
But as I said we had no
markers for these cells.

00:08:53.451 --> 00:08:56.494
We had no real idea of what
made them distinct molecularly

00:08:56.494 --> 00:09:00.340
from the ventricular radial
glia for example in the mouse.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.112
And so, we took as an approach for this

00:09:02.112 --> 00:09:03.878
is single-cell RNA sequencing.

00:09:03.878 --> 00:09:07.756
So we dissociated early cells shown here,

00:09:07.756 --> 00:09:08.943
took those individual cells

00:09:08.943 --> 00:09:11.693
and collected them in microliter

00:09:13.811 --> 00:09:17.728
tiny little nano-sized
capture sites in a chip,

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.470
a microfluidic chip which is made by

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.477
Fluidigm Corporation.

00:09:22.477 --> 00:09:24.521
And when they're captured
in these little sites

00:09:24.521 --> 00:09:27.775
you can then do a lysis
and reverse transcription

00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:28.912
and amplify them,

00:09:28.912 --> 00:09:32.025
and then sequence the genes
for each individual cell.

00:09:32.025 --> 00:09:33.294
And that's in an unbiased way.

00:09:33.294 --> 00:09:34.733
That is we take all comers and see

00:09:34.733 --> 00:09:37.924
what those gene differences look like.

00:09:37.924 --> 00:09:39.767
And here's an example of a heat map

00:09:39.767 --> 00:09:42.213
where we have the cells in all these rows

00:09:42.213 --> 00:09:43.769
and genes in columns.

00:09:43.769 --> 00:09:45.065
And you can see how they cluster

00:09:45.065 --> 00:09:47.072
according to the genes that they express.

00:09:47.072 --> 00:09:49.293
And that allows us to identify

00:09:49.293 --> 00:09:53.190
molecular characteristics
of specific cell types.

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:54.580
And just to look at
some of the progenitors

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.726
and this is when we first
did our initial study

00:09:56.726 --> 00:10:00.122
of about 300 cells that
were captured this way.

00:10:00.122 --> 00:10:02.706
We can see three different cell states.

00:10:02.706 --> 00:10:04.819
Here in the lower left are
the radial glial genes,

00:10:04.819 --> 00:10:06.332
the ones that are most enriched

00:10:06.332 --> 00:10:07.737
in radial glial cells.

00:10:07.737 --> 00:10:09.770
In the brackets are the
intermediate progenitors

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.695
which are the daughters
of the radial glia.

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:13.721
And then here on the
right in the upper side

00:10:13.721 --> 00:10:17.437
are the enriched genes mostly
in young immature neurons.

00:10:17.437 --> 00:10:19.094
And what this shows us is that some genes

00:10:19.094 --> 00:10:21.980
that are initially
expressed in the radial glia

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.646
persist in their daughter cells,

00:10:23.646 --> 00:10:24.924
the intermediate progenitors.

00:10:24.924 --> 00:10:27.100
And genes that are expressed
in those progenitors

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.288
persist as neurons are produced.

00:10:29.288 --> 00:10:30.859
And this is very useful in a way

00:10:30.859 --> 00:10:33.777
because it helps us watch
the lineage of these cells.

00:10:33.777 --> 00:10:36.505
So example shown here actually confirms

00:10:36.505 --> 00:10:38.383
what we saw from the time-lapse imaging.

00:10:38.383 --> 00:10:40.231
Radial glial cells shown here on the Left

00:10:40.231 --> 00:10:41.852
producing intermediate progenitors

00:10:41.852 --> 00:10:43.388
that then generate neurons,

00:10:43.388 --> 00:10:46.705
and these are some of the
genes both known and new genes

00:10:46.705 --> 00:10:48.830
expressed at each of
these different stages.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:51.169
We confirm the expression of the new genes

00:10:51.169 --> 00:10:53.851
by in situ hybridization
shown here in slices.

00:10:53.851 --> 00:10:56.272
Genes that we predict would
be expressed in radial glia

00:10:56.272 --> 00:10:58.061
are located here at the ventricle.

00:10:58.061 --> 00:11:01.113
The genes expressed in
intermediate progenitors

00:11:01.113 --> 00:11:02.973
outer radial glia are expressed here.

00:11:02.973 --> 00:11:05.217
And then the neural genes are expressed

00:11:05.217 --> 00:11:07.050
in the cortical plate.

00:11:08.141 --> 00:11:10.560
Now not only do this give us an idea of

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.776
the transition or lineage of cell types

00:11:12.776 --> 00:11:15.491
but it gave us insight into
activated gene networks

00:11:15.491 --> 00:11:18.189
that might actually be
signaling individual cell types.

00:11:18.189 --> 00:11:21.598
And to focus on the outer
radial glia for this talk,

00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:24.815
these are all schematically shown genes

00:11:24.815 --> 00:11:26.775
that are coherent in networks

00:11:26.775 --> 00:11:29.271
expressed exclusively by outer radial glia

00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:31.275
at these early developmental stages.

00:11:31.275 --> 00:11:34.118
And one of those gene
networks and pathways

00:11:34.118 --> 00:11:36.539
is the LIFR/STAT3 signaling pathway

00:11:36.539 --> 00:11:38.465
known to most stem cell biologists

00:11:38.465 --> 00:11:41.271
as an important self-renewal pathway.

00:11:41.271 --> 00:11:43.044
So we find that these
outer radial glial cells

00:11:43.044 --> 00:11:45.589
are actually able to self renew themselves

00:11:45.589 --> 00:11:46.761
and create their own niche.

00:11:46.761 --> 00:11:49.226
If we inhibit this pathway as shown here

00:11:49.226 --> 00:11:51.237
in these graphs on the lower right,

00:11:51.237 --> 00:11:53.072
we significantly inhibit

00:11:53.072 --> 00:11:55.038
the generation of the radial glial cells

00:11:55.038 --> 00:11:56.961
but not the intermediate progenitors,

00:11:56.961 --> 00:11:58.724
or for that matter, the
ventricular radial glia.

00:11:58.724 --> 00:12:01.090
So it's selective to this one cell type

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:04.316
and it helps support an idea shown here

00:12:04.316 --> 00:12:06.949
that distinguishes the
human from the mouse.

00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:09.268
In the mouse as you know as we just heard,

00:12:09.268 --> 00:12:11.651
they have radial glial cells
and intermediate progenitors

00:12:11.651 --> 00:12:13.633
and the radial glial
cells line the ventricle

00:12:13.633 --> 00:12:15.624
where they can receive
trophic factors signaling

00:12:15.624 --> 00:12:18.960
from the CSF, cerebrospinal fluid.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.547
In the outer subventricular zone

00:12:20.547 --> 00:12:23.083
the cells have actually
moved away for the ventricle

00:12:23.083 --> 00:12:24.877
and they're not able to access

00:12:24.877 --> 00:12:26.897
the growth factors in the CSF,

00:12:26.897 --> 00:12:30.064
but instead they developed
their own signaling pathways.

00:12:30.064 --> 00:12:31.694
They can produce their own growth factors

00:12:31.694 --> 00:12:32.988
and they create their own niche

00:12:32.988 --> 00:12:35.598
for self renewal and expansion.

00:12:35.598 --> 00:12:37.540
And we think that that is
one of the reasons of course

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.297
that these cells were able to undergo

00:12:39.297 --> 00:12:42.508
the kind of prolonged
and massive proliferation

00:12:42.508 --> 00:12:46.433
that I've shown you and that
Wieland mentioned just earlier.

00:12:46.433 --> 00:12:48.747
We've also gotten some
insights into diseases

00:12:48.747 --> 00:12:51.003
and I just wanna mention
two of them very quickly.

00:12:51.003 --> 00:12:52.524
One of them is this.

00:12:52.524 --> 00:12:53.848
And as I've just mentioned,

00:12:53.848 --> 00:12:56.042
these outer radial glial
cells make their own niche

00:12:56.042 --> 00:12:59.462
and they have factors
that promote self-renewal.

00:12:59.462 --> 00:13:01.532
And when we looked at all
these genes in the literature

00:13:01.532 --> 00:13:03.608
we found that they'd all
been reported earlier

00:13:03.608 --> 00:13:04.849
or already discovered

00:13:04.849 --> 00:13:07.265
in this particular kind of a tumor,

00:13:07.265 --> 00:13:08.974
the glioblastoma multiforme

00:13:08.974 --> 00:13:11.711
which is a terrible and inoperable

00:13:11.711 --> 00:13:15.119
brain tumor found in
adults, not in children.

00:13:15.119 --> 00:13:18.254
But when we look carefully
at the published single-cell

00:13:18.254 --> 00:13:21.296
heat maps like this one
for radial glial genes,

00:13:21.296 --> 00:13:24.259
rather for genes that
are expressed in tumors

00:13:24.259 --> 00:13:25.485
as well as radial glia,

00:13:25.485 --> 00:13:28.180
we cross those reference points.

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:31.923
We found that in fact that the
most aggressive glioblastomas

00:13:31.923 --> 00:13:34.642
were enriched in the
same genes that we found

00:13:34.642 --> 00:13:36.532
in the outer radial glial cells.

00:13:36.532 --> 00:13:39.718
They had apparently an outer
radial glial cell signature

00:13:39.718 --> 00:13:43.162
in the most aggressive
grade of glioblastoma.

00:13:43.162 --> 00:13:45.603
So then we looked in surgical specimens

00:13:45.603 --> 00:13:47.879
that we got from our colleagues at UCSF,

00:13:47.879 --> 00:13:49.957
sectioned and stained and cultured them

00:13:49.957 --> 00:13:52.485
just like we had a primary tissue.

00:13:52.485 --> 00:13:54.618
And shown here are glioblastoma cells

00:13:54.618 --> 00:13:56.282
from one of the patients

00:13:56.282 --> 00:13:59.308
and I focus your attention on this cell

00:13:59.308 --> 00:14:01.391
as it undergoes division.

00:14:03.085 --> 00:14:04.380
I hope you can see it, yeah there it is.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.731
Watch that one.

00:14:05.731 --> 00:14:06.945
Here we go.

00:14:06.945 --> 00:14:07.778
Right.

00:14:07.778 --> 00:14:09.541
So you may have noticed
how it jumped and divided

00:14:09.541 --> 00:14:12.780
exactly like the fetal cells do in situ.

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.876
So it looks as though we
have outer radial glial cells

00:14:14.876 --> 00:14:16.988
in these glioblastomas and in fact,

00:14:16.988 --> 00:14:18.367
that work is progressed to the point

00:14:18.367 --> 00:14:20.014
where we now have good evidence

00:14:20.014 --> 00:14:23.144
that these may be these cells of origin

00:14:23.144 --> 00:14:26.529
for these very aggressive
glioblastoma tumors.

00:14:26.529 --> 00:14:29.470
The next slide which has
to do with microcephaly

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.062
and microcephaly of course is a condition

00:14:31.062 --> 00:14:33.191
where the brain is orders of magnitude

00:14:33.191 --> 00:14:35.958
smaller than it would normally be.

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.786
And the most dramatic cases of this

00:14:37.786 --> 00:14:40.611
occurred in Brazil last summer

00:14:40.611 --> 00:14:43.618
when there was an outbreak
of Zika-induced microcephaly,

00:14:43.618 --> 00:14:45.080
but initially it wasn't clear

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.120
that the Zika virus was
producing the microcephaly.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.045
We were struck by the fact that

00:14:51.045 --> 00:14:54.080
literature suggested there
was one specific factor

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.555
that mediated the entry of
the Zika virus into the skin,

00:14:57.555 --> 00:15:00.208
and that was something
called the AXL receptor.

00:15:00.208 --> 00:15:02.520
In our dataset from the outer radial glia

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.906
we've been talking
about on the other cells

00:15:03.906 --> 00:15:05.939
in the developing brain is shown here

00:15:05.939 --> 00:15:07.755
for all of the receptors known

00:15:07.755 --> 00:15:10.574
to mediate entry of flaviviruses.

00:15:10.574 --> 00:15:12.515
And the Zika virus uses
the ones shown here

00:15:12.515 --> 00:15:15.378
with the black dots to
get into other cell types.

00:15:15.378 --> 00:15:17.969
And I'll emphasize that the AXL receptor

00:15:17.969 --> 00:15:20.364
which mediates Zika entry into other cells

00:15:20.364 --> 00:15:22.981
is highly enriched but
only in certain cells

00:15:22.981 --> 00:15:24.195
in our dataset.

00:15:24.195 --> 00:15:26.599
Shown here it's enriched in astrocytes,

00:15:26.599 --> 00:15:28.128
in radial glial cells,

00:15:28.128 --> 00:15:31.152
not in intermediate
progenitors, not in neurons,

00:15:31.152 --> 00:15:32.422
not an inter neurons.

00:15:32.422 --> 00:15:34.455
And also in microglia and endothelium.

00:15:34.455 --> 00:15:36.875
It has a very specific
pattern of expression

00:15:36.875 --> 00:15:39.341
which we predicted might be the

00:15:39.341 --> 00:15:41.007
tropism of the virus as well,

00:15:41.007 --> 00:15:42.453
that as the virus would enter the cells

00:15:42.453 --> 00:15:44.624
that express that receptor.

00:15:44.624 --> 00:15:46.636
And so we managed in
collaboration with Joe DeRisi

00:15:46.636 --> 00:15:48.170
to get active virus from a patient

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:50.710
who traveled to San Francisco from Brazil.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.520
And he was donating blood

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.410
and the blood actually turned
out to have active virus.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:55.794
So we cultured the virus

00:15:55.794 --> 00:15:57.694
and exposed our tissue sections.

00:15:57.694 --> 00:16:00.456
And shown here in green is the Zika virus

00:16:00.456 --> 00:16:04.125
reproducing in cells in the
outer subventricular zone

00:16:04.125 --> 00:16:06.254
which included the
outer radial glial cells

00:16:06.254 --> 00:16:07.205
that I've been talking about.

00:16:07.205 --> 00:16:09.726
It seems to be that they're
a very favorite target

00:16:09.726 --> 00:16:11.893
of the Zika virus.

00:16:11.893 --> 00:16:15.160
So, shown here in fact is the
outer radial glial cell packed

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.595
with the viral particles
just prior to rupture.

00:16:18.595 --> 00:16:20.476
So these outer subventricular zone cells

00:16:20.476 --> 00:16:22.970
are specifically and especially vulnerable

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.661
to infection with the Zika virus.

00:16:25.661 --> 00:16:29.052
And when these patients
are born with microcephaly

00:16:29.052 --> 00:16:31.716
it makes sense of course that
the neural progenitor cells

00:16:31.716 --> 00:16:33.029
might be selectively affected.

00:16:33.029 --> 00:16:34.756
And there's much more that goes on in this

00:16:34.756 --> 00:16:36.422
devastating condition than just

00:16:36.422 --> 00:16:37.861
infection of these outer radial glia,

00:16:37.861 --> 00:16:41.220
but this seems to be part of the picture.

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.150
And we also took
advantage of the fact that

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:45.067
AXL we hypothesized was

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:47.760
mediating entry of the virus

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.624
to block it with a variety of different

00:16:49.624 --> 00:16:50.927
chemicals and antibodies,

00:16:50.927 --> 00:16:53.187
and shown here is an
example of a chemical block

00:16:53.187 --> 00:16:55.175
of the AXL receptor.

00:16:55.175 --> 00:16:57.343
And these are cultured human cells

00:16:57.343 --> 00:16:58.657
that are exposed to the virus

00:16:58.657 --> 00:17:00.688
and the green dots are the cells that are

00:17:00.688 --> 00:17:02.421
actually infected with the virus.

00:17:02.421 --> 00:17:05.051
And if you block the AXL
receptors shown here on the right

00:17:05.051 --> 00:17:09.245
you can significantly reduce
the cells that get infected.

00:17:09.245 --> 00:17:11.053
Confirming that the AXL receptors

00:17:11.053 --> 00:17:13.667
is probably meeting entry into these,

00:17:13.667 --> 00:17:16.252
at least these human cell types.

00:17:16.252 --> 00:17:17.996
Now I was very interested
as I mentioned earlier

00:17:17.996 --> 00:17:20.274
to find markers or
genes uniquely expressed

00:17:20.274 --> 00:17:22.517
in these outer radial glia
that we could use as a tool

00:17:22.517 --> 00:17:25.403
to try to learn more about the cell types.

00:17:25.403 --> 00:17:27.669
And we're very gratified
in our first 300 cells

00:17:27.669 --> 00:17:29.164
that we were able to do that.

00:17:29.164 --> 00:17:31.892
Shown on the left are novel markers

00:17:31.892 --> 00:17:33.203
that express themselves only

00:17:33.203 --> 00:17:35.659
in the ventricular radial glia shown here.

00:17:35.659 --> 00:17:38.198
And on the right are the
more interesting to me

00:17:38.198 --> 00:17:41.086
novel gene markers that are expressed

00:17:41.086 --> 00:17:43.587
in outer radial glia only.

00:17:43.587 --> 00:17:47.285
And we justified or rather
we validated these markers

00:17:47.285 --> 00:17:49.481
first by showing that they stain cells

00:17:49.481 --> 00:17:52.211
with the morphology and
location of outer radial glia,

00:17:52.211 --> 00:17:54.144
but also dynamically we watched cells

00:17:54.144 --> 00:17:56.232
in our time-lapse imaging jump and divide.

00:17:56.232 --> 00:17:58.444
And then we fixed them and
stained them with these markers

00:17:58.444 --> 00:18:00.013
to confirm that the
cells that were jumping

00:18:00.013 --> 00:18:01.496
were in fact expressing

00:18:01.496 --> 00:18:04.294
these outer radial glial
markers and they were.

00:18:04.294 --> 00:18:07.163
So this gives us now a
whole new set of tools

00:18:07.163 --> 00:18:10.321
to start looking at these
outer radial glial cells.

00:18:10.321 --> 00:18:11.962
One of the first things we noticed

00:18:11.962 --> 00:18:14.264
challenges or I should say modifies

00:18:14.264 --> 00:18:16.612
this classic model of human cortical

00:18:16.612 --> 00:18:18.167
or primate cortical development

00:18:18.167 --> 00:18:19.846
that Pasko Rakic proposed known as

00:18:19.846 --> 00:18:21.809
the Radial Unit Hypothesis.

00:18:21.809 --> 00:18:26.042
Very influential and still
very concise explanation

00:18:26.042 --> 00:18:28.120
of how radial units form

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.096
and how they multiply over
time and also of evolution.

00:18:32.096 --> 00:18:34.518
And I wanna emphasize the
radial glial scaffold here

00:18:34.518 --> 00:18:37.217
which are all these fibers
go from radial glia down here

00:18:37.217 --> 00:18:40.115
to the cortex along which neurons migrate.

00:18:40.115 --> 00:18:42.948
And the model proposed
that this scaffold persists

00:18:42.948 --> 00:18:45.125
throughout cortical development.

00:18:45.125 --> 00:18:46.932
And we were struck when we had new markers

00:18:46.932 --> 00:18:48.892
as I mentioned just a moment ago

00:18:48.892 --> 00:18:50.734
that there seems to be a discontinuation

00:18:50.734 --> 00:18:53.298
of the radial glial
fibers at later stages.

00:18:53.298 --> 00:18:56.862
And that was evident from
these two cell markers.

00:18:56.862 --> 00:19:00.082
In red I'm showing you HOPX
which is a gene expressed

00:19:00.082 --> 00:19:03.052
throughout this outer
radial glial cell cytoplasm.

00:19:03.052 --> 00:19:04.842
And you can see red
fibers that you can trace

00:19:04.842 --> 00:19:06.560
all the way up to the pial surface.

00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.090
In green is CRYAB which is a marker

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:12.566
that our data suggested was
only in ventricular radial glia,

00:19:12.566 --> 00:19:14.507
and the green fibers only went up

00:19:14.507 --> 00:19:16.003
to the outer subventricular zone

00:19:16.003 --> 00:19:19.033
and never went further
at these later stages.

00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:20.249
Suggesting that these fibers

00:19:20.249 --> 00:19:22.696
and these fibers were discontinuous.

00:19:22.696 --> 00:19:24.512
And we check that in a different way

00:19:24.512 --> 00:19:27.409
by using Dil which is a lipophilic dye

00:19:27.409 --> 00:19:30.640
that can be transported
along radial fibers.

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.367
And if we put those crystals on the top

00:19:32.367 --> 00:19:33.979
or the bottom of this slice,

00:19:33.979 --> 00:19:36.671
either way we were able to
show these continuous fibers

00:19:36.671 --> 00:19:39.881
at ages up to around gestational week 16.

00:19:39.881 --> 00:19:42.168
But beyond that picture
was quite different.

00:19:42.168 --> 00:19:43.611
If we put Dil at the surface

00:19:43.611 --> 00:19:46.891
it back-filled fibers only to
the outer subventricular zone

00:19:46.891 --> 00:19:49.339
where they ended in
outer radial glial cells.

00:19:49.339 --> 00:19:52.291
And if we put the Dil
at the ventricle it only

00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:53.964
went generally as far as

00:19:53.964 --> 00:19:55.801
the same outer subventricular zone,

00:19:55.801 --> 00:19:58.715
suggesting a kind of a handoff of cells

00:19:58.715 --> 00:20:01.433
from one zone to the other.

00:20:01.433 --> 00:20:03.800
And that led to this
model which is a model

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.274
that suggests that the
second half of neurogenesis,

00:20:06.274 --> 00:20:07.559
the upper cortical layers,

00:20:07.559 --> 00:20:09.415
are produced by outer radial glia,

00:20:09.415 --> 00:20:11.564
not by these ventricular radial glia

00:20:11.564 --> 00:20:14.491
which now have transformed
into truncated radial glias.

00:20:14.491 --> 00:20:16.804
We think there are three
kinds of radial glia

00:20:16.804 --> 00:20:19.768
in cortical, in human
cortical development.

00:20:19.768 --> 00:20:22.820
And we've now expanded
our single-cell analysis

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.840
to all these different cell types,

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.335
is given us an idea not only of

00:20:27.335 --> 00:20:29.172
the diversity of cell
types that are produced

00:20:29.172 --> 00:20:31.673
in the human brain compared to the mouse,

00:20:31.673 --> 00:20:33.756
but we've also identified

00:20:34.821 --> 00:20:37.818
unique markers for each of
these different cell types

00:20:37.818 --> 00:20:39.404
at different stages of development

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:41.347
in different brain regions.

00:20:41.347 --> 00:20:44.310
And one of them I wanna mention is DAB1

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:46.351
which is a Reelin effector.

00:20:46.351 --> 00:20:48.432
It's found in radial glia at the ventricle

00:20:48.432 --> 00:20:49.925
in the outer radial glia

00:20:49.925 --> 00:20:53.750
but not in the truncated radial
glia which would be here.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.280
And what's interesting
is that these two cells

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.369
have fibers that go all
the way up to the pia

00:20:57.369 --> 00:20:59.345
where they can receive Reelin signaling

00:20:59.345 --> 00:21:00.721
and the tRGs don't.

00:21:00.721 --> 00:21:03.144
So it very nicely justifies or validates

00:21:03.144 --> 00:21:05.783
the discontinuous glial scaffold model

00:21:05.783 --> 00:21:08.184
that I showed you earlier.

00:21:08.184 --> 00:21:09.455
And then I just wanted to summarize

00:21:09.455 --> 00:21:10.905
the points that I've made so far

00:21:10.905 --> 00:21:12.324
that the developmental evolution

00:21:12.324 --> 00:21:14.394
of these three neural stem cell types,

00:21:14.394 --> 00:21:18.408
the ventricular, outer
and truncated radial glia

00:21:18.408 --> 00:21:21.109
we think help understand the expansion

00:21:21.109 --> 00:21:23.222
and organization of cerebral cortex.

00:21:23.222 --> 00:21:24.563
That the outer radial glial cells

00:21:24.563 --> 00:21:27.887
are enriched in self-renewal
and proliferation genes

00:21:27.887 --> 00:21:31.783
and that has led to some
disease-associated effects.

00:21:31.783 --> 00:21:33.331
And that the mechanism
for human developmental

00:21:33.331 --> 00:21:35.084
and evolutionary brain expansion

00:21:35.084 --> 00:21:38.207
could be co-opted in
disorders like brain tumors

00:21:38.207 --> 00:21:41.411
and could be targeted in
disorders such as microcephaly.

00:21:41.411 --> 00:21:44.015
And finally I wanna thank all
the people who did the work

00:21:44.015 --> 00:21:45.654
especially Aparna, Alex and Tom,

00:21:45.654 --> 00:21:47.076
very gifted postdocs.

00:21:47.076 --> 00:21:50.062
Alex and Tom are setting up
their own labs now at UCSF

00:21:50.062 --> 00:21:51.959
and our sponsoring organizations.

00:21:51.959 --> 00:21:53.222
Thank you for your attention.

00:21:53.222 --> 00:21:54.782
(audience applauding)

00:21:54.782 --> 00:21:57.365
(upbeat music)
