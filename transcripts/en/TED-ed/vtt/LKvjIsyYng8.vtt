00:00:06.994 --> 00:00:09.445
Created by logician Raymond Smullyan

00:00:09.445 --> 00:00:12.566
and popularized by his colleague
George Boolos,

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:17.176
this riddle has been called the hardest
logic puzzle ever.

00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:21.515
You and your team have crash-landed
on an ancient planet.

00:00:21.515 --> 00:00:26.516
The only way off is to appease
its three alien overlords,

00:00:26.516 --> 00:00:29.056
Tee, Eff, and Arr,

00:00:29.056 --> 00:00:31.745
by giving them the correct artifacts.

00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:34.596
Unfortunately, you don't
know who is who.

00:00:34.596 --> 00:00:39.187
From an inscription, you learn that you
may ask three yes or no questions,

00:00:39.187 --> 00:00:42.266
each addressed to any one lord.

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.747
Tee's answers are always true,

00:00:44.747 --> 00:00:46.776
Eff's are always false,

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:50.327
and Arr's answer is random each time.

00:00:50.327 --> 00:00:51.767
But there's a problem.

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:54.839
You've deciphered the language enough
to ask any question,

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.927
but you don't know which of the two
words 'ozo' and 'ulu' means yes

00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:01.628
and which means no.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:05.188
How can you still figure out 
which alien is which?

00:01:05.188 --> 00:01:08.147
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself!

00:01:08.147 --> 00:01:09.968
Answer in: 3

00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:11.447
2

00:01:11.447 --> 00:01:12.716
1

00:01:12.716 --> 00:01:17.228
At first, this puzzle seems not just hard,
but downright impossible.

00:01:17.228 --> 00:01:18.797
What good is asking a question

00:01:18.797 --> 00:01:23.227
if you can neither understand the answer
nor know if it's true?

00:01:23.227 --> 00:01:24.918
But it can be done.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:27.598
The key is to carefully formulate
our questions

00:01:27.598 --> 00:01:31.298
so that any answer 
yields useful information.

00:01:31.298 --> 00:01:35.827
First of all, we can get around
to not knowing what 'ozo' and 'ulu' mean

00:01:35.827 --> 00:01:39.578
by including the words themselves
in the questions,

00:01:39.578 --> 00:01:43.539
and secondly, if we load each question
with a hypothetical condition,

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.988
whether an alien is lying or not
won't actually matter.

00:01:47.988 --> 00:01:49.559
To see how that could work,

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:53.630
imagine our question
is whether two plus two is four.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.399
Instead of posing it directly,

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.348
we say, "If I asked you whether
two plus two is four,

00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:01.539
would you answer 'ozo'?"

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.619
If 'ozo' means yes 
and the overlord is Tee,

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.359
it truthfully replies, "ozo."

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:09.289
But what if we ask Eff?

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.459
Well, it would answer "ulu,"
or no to the embedded question,

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.116
so it lies and replies 'ozo' instead.

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:20.049
And if 'ozo' actually means no,

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.589
then the answer to 
our embedded question is 'ulu,'

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:27.069
and both Tee and Eff still reply 'ozo,'

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.110
each for their own reasons.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.180
If you're confused about why this works,

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.610
the reason involves logical structure.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.640
A double positive and a double negative
both result in a positive.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.320
Now, we can be sure that asking
either Tee or Eff a question put this way

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.461
will yield 'ozo'
if the hypothetical question is true

00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:49.630
and 'ulu' if it's false

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.020
regardless of what 
each word actually means.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.621
Unfortunately, 
this doesn't help us with Arr.

00:02:56.621 --> 00:03:01.231
But don't worry, we can use our first
question to identify one alien lord

00:03:01.231 --> 00:03:03.771
that definitely isn't Arr.

00:03:03.771 --> 00:03:08.112
Then we can use the second to find out
whether its Tee or Eff.

00:03:08.112 --> 00:03:09.371
And once we know that,

00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:12.955
we can ask it to identify 
one of the others.

00:03:12.955 --> 00:03:14.732
So let's begin.

00:03:14.732 --> 00:03:16.452
Ask the alien in the middle,

00:03:16.452 --> 00:03:22.122
"If I asked you whether the overlord on
my left is Arr, would you answer 'ozo'?"

00:03:22.122 --> 00:03:26.342
If the reply is 'ozo,' 
there are two possibilities.

00:03:26.342 --> 00:03:30.961
You could already be talking to Arr,
in which case the answer is meaningless.

00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:34.921
But otherwise, you're talking to either
Tee or Eff,

00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:36.191
and as we know,

00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:41.402
getting 'ozo' from either one means 
your hypothetical question was correct,

00:03:41.402 --> 00:03:44.713
and the left overlord is indeed Arr.

00:03:44.713 --> 00:03:49.463
Either way, you can be sure the alien
on the right is not Arr.

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:52.072
Similarly, if the answer is 'ulu,'

00:03:52.072 --> 00:03:55.662
then you know the alien 
on the left can't be Arr.

00:03:55.662 --> 00:04:00.027
Now go to the overlord you've determined
isn't Arr and ask,

00:04:00.027 --> 00:04:04.163
"If I asked 'are you Eff?' 
would you answer 'ozo'?"

00:04:04.163 --> 00:04:07.152
Since you don't have to worry about
the random possibility,

00:04:07.152 --> 00:04:11.303
either answer will 
establish its identity.

00:04:11.303 --> 00:04:14.373
Now that you know whether its
answers are true or false,

00:04:14.373 --> 00:04:19.471
ask the same alien whether the center
overlord is Arr.

00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:23.984
The process of elimination will identify
the remaining one.

00:04:23.984 --> 00:04:26.853
The satisfied overlords help you
repair your ship

00:04:26.853 --> 00:04:28.863
and you prepare for takeoff.

00:04:28.863 --> 00:04:33.473
Allowed one final question, you ask
Tee if it's a long way to Earth,

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:36.393
and he answers "ozo."

00:04:36.393 --> 00:04:39.283
Too bad you still don't know 
what that means.
