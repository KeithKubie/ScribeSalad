00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:12.620
Improvisation is an important tool for comedy
filmmakers ever since the days of silent films.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.990
When you have guys like Will Farrell, Steve
Carrell and Sacha Baron Cohen on set you know

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.770
they are going to steer away from the script
so you better keep the cameras rolling.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.590
These improvised scenes sometimes help improve
the written word and we are going to take

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.050
a look at ten scenes that it actually did.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:35.710
If you’re a Mel Brooks fan like we are stick
around for a hilarious gem from the king of

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.910
comedy.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:53.059
Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten 10 Improvised
Movie Moments That Made the Comedy Even Better.

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.059
The Hangover

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.210
For those of us that watched the NBC sitcom
The Office, we know that Ed Helms had a skill

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.070
for playing musical instruments.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.059
The actor seems to find a reason to sing or
play an instrument in all of his projects

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.840
and The Hangover was not different.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.350
He found a way to sneak a song in even though
it wasn’t in the script.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:20.670
There was a piano on the set, so he sat down
and asked them to press record.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:29.930
Luckily the chicken was a professional and
didn’t break character.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:30.930
Dumb and Dumber

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:40.810
Many of the Dumb and Dumber’s most memorable
lines were improvised on the spot, and the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.380
Farrelly brothers gave Jim Carrey free rein
to try jokes out whenever he wanted.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.950
When Carrey walked out of a bar there was
a newspaper with the headline “Man Walks

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.049
on the Moon” hanging on the wall.

00:01:51.049 --> 00:02:01.229
Carrey had a moment of genius and improvised
his lines of excitement for the 1969 headline.

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:13.400
This was only one of the many lines he improvised.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.400
Superbad

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.609
Greg Mottola’s Superbad was the ultimate
teenage comedy at the time of its release

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.760
and the jokes were some of the best out there
that year.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.850
One of the writer’s Evan Goldberg had the
idea to film the cast dancing and loop it

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.540
during the DVD menu.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.160
Actor Michael Cera improvised almost an hour
of dancing and they realized it was actually

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.160
funny.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:38.450
So they decided to make that the opening title
sequence and get Jonah Hill to join in on

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.359
the dancing.

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:44.359
American Pie

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:49.980
With her stories of the famed camp, Alyson
Hannigan made every teen boy want to go to

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.260
band camp due to 1999 comedy American Pie.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.780
During her sex scene with Jason Biggs the
actress seemed to be a little too caught up

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.230
in the moment and let out her wild side.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.850
When they were in the action the actress broke
out her famous lines even though it wasn’t

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.850
in the script.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.090
Luckily Jason Biggs kept his composure and
went with the improvised line too.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:21.120
Now if we could only find that band camp she
speaks of.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.229
Bridesmaids

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:27.270
For his 2011 film Bridesmaids, director Paul
Figg put together a cast that went on to be

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.530
some of the biggest MVP’s in comedy films
today.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:39.419
He allowed his stars to have free reign over
their characters 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:43.290
and before filming the engagement party scene
he had his cast improvise for prior to filming.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.290
Then he took his favorite jokes and added
them into the script so he could get the best

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:54.910
jokes on screen.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:02.780
It proved to be a smart move since they film
was a success.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.780
Galaxy Quest

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:14.200
The world has been waiting for a sequel of
Galaxy Quest for over 15 years, despite the

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.660
film not being a large financial success,
fans loved the film.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.160
They loved it so much that fans voted it the
seventh best Star Trek movie ever at the Star

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.840
Trek 2013 Convention.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.280
The film had an ensemble cast of comedy actors
that make this film a delight including some

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.820
unknowns at the time.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.130
One actor who was just getting his start was
Sam Rockwell but that didn’t stop him from

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:41.010
improvising as he watched a creepy make out
scene.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.240
Borat!

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:51.070
Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit
Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:55.060
Most people believe that Sacha Baron Cohen’s
Borat was improvised and made up while the

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.060
cameras were rolling.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:00.220
But the film was actually scripted and was
even nominated for an Academy Award for Best

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.470
Original Screenplay.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.760
Still, Cohen was one of the writers and had
played the part of Borat for many years before

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.630
the film so he knew his character.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:16.440
Borat improvised his Kazakh language with
a mixture of Hebrew and Israeli slang and

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:27.030
he pulls it off well.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.220
Step Brothers

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.710
Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly are two actors
that work perfectly when on screen together.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.580
You can tell they enjoy each other’s company
and know how to feed off of each other.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.460
In the film Step Brothers, the two share one
of the funniest moments in the movie while

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.150
improvising the entire scene.

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.610
Both men awaken and sleep walk in the film
causing havoc and driving their newly wed

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:52.160
parents nuts.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.580
We can’t wait to see them on screen together
again.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.580
Young Frankenstein

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.680
Mel Brooks is one of the greatest comedy minds
that has ever lived and ever will.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.060
The world is a better place for him being
here.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.680
In 1974 he teamed up with another comedy legend,
Gene Wilder to adapt Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:18.780
into a comedy by the name of Young Frankenstein.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.940
The film is considered by anyone with good
taste one of the greatest comedies ever made

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.120
and scenes like this is why.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.110
During a scene when Wilder throws a dart off
camera, Brooks had the idea to shriek like

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.120
a cat proving his genius for comedy timing.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:42.389
And let’s not forget how awesome that cat
shriek was!

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:43.650
Neighbors 2

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:47.639
Ever since Seth Rogen starred as the beer
drinking co-worker of Steve Carell in the

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.210
40-Year-Old Virgin he has been loved by fans.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.700
He’s a writer himself so he likes to improvise
on set and that’s what he did with Chloë

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.480
Grace Moretz in Neighbors 2.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:03.130
The young star wasn’t accustomed to this
quick improvisation but she kept her own while

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:04.130
on scene with the actor.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:12.500
Moretz fought with Rogen and co-star Rose
Byrne in a scene, improvising her hiss to

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.280
expand her character’s style.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:21.340
She seems to be a feisty co-star.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.630
There you have it, ten Improvised Movie Moments
That Made the Comedy Even Better.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.440
