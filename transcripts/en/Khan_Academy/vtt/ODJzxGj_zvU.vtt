00:00:00.596 --> 00:00:03.786
- [Instructor] Tomas dropped
off two packages to be shipped.

00:00:03.786 --> 00:00:06.703
One package weighed 1.38 kilograms,

00:00:08.953 --> 00:00:12.286
and the other package weighed 720 grams.

00:00:13.293 --> 00:00:15.253
So the first one they give in kilograms,

00:00:15.253 --> 00:00:18.213
and the second one they give us in grams.

00:00:18.213 --> 00:00:23.213
What was the combined weight
of both packages in grams?

00:00:23.213 --> 00:00:25.642
So what I wanna do is, I'm
gonna convert both of these

00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:29.493
to grams, and then add 'em up
to get the combined weight.

00:00:29.493 --> 00:00:33.616
Well, we already know the
second one is 720 grams,

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:36.430
but what's the first
one in terms of grams?

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.263
Well, let's see, 1.38,

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:42.522
I could write kilograms like that.

00:00:42.522 --> 00:00:46.075
Well, if one kilogram is 1,000 grams,

00:00:46.075 --> 00:00:49.148
and that's what the prefix
kilo means, it means 1,000,

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:51.769
well, to go from one to
1.38, I'm multiplying

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:52.602
by 1.38,

00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:57.594
so I'm also, if I want
it in terms of grams,

00:00:57.594 --> 00:01:01.177
I'll take 1,000 grams
and multiply by 1.38.

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.214
So this is going to be 1,000 times 1.38

00:01:05.214 --> 00:01:06.464
is 1,380 grams,

00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:13.005
which I could've just denoted with a G,

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:14.658
but now let's add those together.

00:01:14.658 --> 00:01:16.620
This is the first package,
and then the second package

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.703
is 720 grams,

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:22.779
and so if I were to add,

00:01:24.434 --> 00:01:28.288
this is going to be,
let's see, got a zero,

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:29.770
10,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.759
well let's see, four plus seven is 11,

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.984
and then one plus one is two.

00:01:34.984 --> 00:01:37.317
We get 2,100 grams in total.

00:01:39.762 --> 00:01:43.929
Let's do another one of these
unit conversion examples.

00:01:45.217 --> 00:01:48.424
Julia and her friends are
making kites out of paper.

00:01:48.424 --> 00:01:51.138
For each kite, they need a piece of paper

00:01:51.138 --> 00:01:53.221
that is 0.65 meters wide.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.778
How many centimeters, how
many centimeters of paper

00:01:59.778 --> 00:02:02.863
will they need to make four kites?

00:02:02.863 --> 00:02:05.706
So they tell us how wide the paper

00:02:05.706 --> 00:02:08.618
is in meters for each kite,

00:02:08.618 --> 00:02:10.610
but they want the answer in centimeters,

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.534
and they want it for four kites.

00:02:12.534 --> 00:02:14.617
So, let's think about this a little bit.

00:02:14.617 --> 00:02:16.700
Each kite is 0.65 meters,

00:02:18.154 --> 00:02:19.154
0.65 meters.

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:23.603
So to go from one to 0.65,

00:02:23.603 --> 00:02:25.436
you'd multiply by 0.65

00:02:27.708 --> 00:02:28.991
on the meters,

00:02:28.991 --> 00:02:30.750
and so to go to 100 centimeters

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.409
to the number of
centimeters you would need

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.979
for the width of a kite, you'd similarly

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:36.396
multiply by 0.65.

00:02:38.493 --> 00:02:40.910
Well, 65 hundredths times 100

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.390
is going to be 65,

00:02:45.014 --> 00:02:47.014
65 centimeters per kite.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.928
So this 0.65 meters wide per kite,

00:02:50.928 --> 00:02:53.928
in centimeters it is 65 centimeters.

00:02:55.472 --> 00:02:57.170
Now, they don't want just how much paper

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.419
will they need to make one kite,

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.790
they want four kites.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.491
So we would multiply this times four.

00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:04.940
This is how much we need per kite,

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.684
so let's multiply that times four.

00:03:06.684 --> 00:03:10.320
And so let's see, four times five is 20.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.694
Four times six is 24,

00:03:12.694 --> 00:03:13.944
plus two is 26.

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:17.549
260 centimeters of paper

00:03:18.434 --> 00:03:21.389
for the width of the four kites.

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.330
Let's do one more of these.

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.113
This is a volume conversion.

00:03:26.113 --> 00:03:29.925
Omar is pouring five liters of water

00:03:29.925 --> 00:03:31.768
into two goldfish bowls.

00:03:31.768 --> 00:03:35.281
He spills 200 milliliters of water,

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:38.093
and then divides the
remaining water evenly

00:03:38.093 --> 00:03:39.839
between the two bowls.

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:42.256
How many milliliters of water

00:03:43.314 --> 00:03:45.514
does Omar pour into each bowl?

00:03:45.514 --> 00:03:47.976
So we want our answer at
the end in milliliters,

00:03:47.976 --> 00:03:49.567
and so let's just convert the amount

00:03:49.567 --> 00:03:51.694
that he starts with into milliliters.

00:03:51.694 --> 00:03:54.204
So he starts with five,

00:03:54.204 --> 00:03:56.454
he starts with five liters.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.789
So how many milliliters
is that going to be?

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:03.787
Well, they tell us one
liter is 1,000 milliliters,

00:04:03.787 --> 00:04:05.122
so if we have five liters,

00:04:05.122 --> 00:04:07.147
we're multiplying our quantity times five,

00:04:07.147 --> 00:04:10.936
that's gonna be five
times, it's going to be

00:04:10.936 --> 00:04:14.306
five times as many milliliters,

00:04:14.306 --> 00:04:18.306
so that's 1,000 times
five is 5,000 milliliters,

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.752
so that's what he starts with.

00:04:23.752 --> 00:04:26.282
Now, before he splits
this 5,000 milliliters

00:04:26.282 --> 00:04:28.282
between these two bowls,

00:04:29.526 --> 00:04:31.402
he spills 200 milliliters,

00:04:31.402 --> 00:04:33.394
so let's subtract out what he spills,

00:04:33.394 --> 00:04:36.874
'cause he, that's not going
to be able to be split.

00:04:36.874 --> 00:04:37.874
Milliliters.

00:04:38.961 --> 00:04:41.507
And so, that's going to give us,

00:04:41.507 --> 00:04:44.889
so we're gonna have 4,800 milliliters

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.639
to split between those two bowls,

00:04:48.694 --> 00:04:51.004
and so each bowl, that's what they ask us,

00:04:51.004 --> 00:04:53.566
how many milliliters of water
does he pour into each bowl?

00:04:53.566 --> 00:04:55.362
Well, see, if he's gonna
split this into two bowls,

00:04:55.362 --> 00:04:57.359
each bowl's gonna get half of this,

00:04:57.359 --> 00:05:01.567
and so each bowl is going
to get half of 4,800,

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:03.213
so we just divide that by two,

00:05:03.213 --> 00:05:07.130
so each bowl is going to
get 2,400 milliliters,

00:05:08.467 --> 00:05:11.800
2,400 milliliters and 2,400 milliliters.

00:05:14.805 --> 00:05:17.555
That's how much each bowl is going,

00:05:17.555 --> 00:05:21.722
that's how much Omar is
going to pour into each bowl.
