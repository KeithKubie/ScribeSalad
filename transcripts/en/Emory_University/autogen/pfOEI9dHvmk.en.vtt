needing introductions around here which
 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.440
needing introductions around here which
is great to see in keeping with the

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:22.450
is great to see in keeping with the
 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.029
is great to see in keeping with the
spirit of this retreat what we thought

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039
spirit of this retreat what we thought
 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:30.510
spirit of this retreat what we thought
we would do is try to bring you through

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520
we would do is try to bring you through
 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.810
we would do is try to bring you through
the landmark hand transplant that was

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820
the landmark hand transplant that was
 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.840
the landmark hand transplant that was
performed here in the context of a

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850
performed here in the context of a
 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.869
performed here in the context of a
university community because you know we

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:39.879
university community because you know we
 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.029
university community because you know we
can practice surgery and medicine

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039
can practice surgery and medicine
 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.399
can practice surgery and medicine
anywhere why should we come to a

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:44.409
anywhere why should we come to a
 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:46.680
anywhere why should we come to a
university to do it and and I think that

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690
university to do it and and I think that
 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.180
university to do it and and I think that
it's because that in a university it

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190
it's because that in a university it
 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.500
it's because that in a university it
allows us to ask the really important

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510
allows us to ask the really important
 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.919
allows us to ask the really important
questions and to try to understand how

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:54.929
questions and to try to understand how
 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.079
questions and to try to understand how
medicine and surgery and the the crafts

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:58.089
medicine and surgery and the the crafts
 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.410
medicine and surgery and the the crafts
that we practice interface with some of

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420
that we practice interface with some of
 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.079
that we practice interface with some of
the fundamental things of life like you

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089
the fundamental things of life like you
 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.650
the fundamental things of life like you
know who are we and as as transplant or

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660
know who are we and as as transplant or
 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.070
know who are we and as as transplant or
this question is really extraordinarily

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080
this question is really extraordinarily
 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.790
this question is really extraordinarily
important question because it it gets to

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800
important question because it it gets to
 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.810
important question because it it gets to
the point of who people are and and what

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820
the point of who people are and and what
 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.520
the point of who people are and and what
is just the scaffolding that allows them

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530
is just the scaffolding that allows them
 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.240
is just the scaffolding that allows them
to walk through life and we're finding

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250
to walk through life and we're finding
 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.880
to walk through life and we're finding
in fact that that increasingly we're

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890
in fact that that increasingly we're
 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.230
in fact that that increasingly we're
mostly scaffolding and and very remotely

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240
mostly scaffolding and and very remotely
 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.680
mostly scaffolding and and very remotely
a soul or an individual and and we've

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690
a soul or an individual and and we've
 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.540
a soul or an individual and and we've
been able to demonstrate that because

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550
been able to demonstrate that because
 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:40.680
been able to demonstrate that because
indeed almost everything now save parts

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690
indeed almost everything now save parts
 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.560
indeed almost everything now save parts
of the cerebral cortex are

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570
of the cerebral cortex are
 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.610
of the cerebral cortex are
interchangeable and that will I think

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620
interchangeable and that will I think
 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.930
interchangeable and that will I think
that brings up a lot of things other

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940
that brings up a lot of things other
 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.420
that brings up a lot of things other
than just the the sewing and like it

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430
than just the the sewing and like it
 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.990
than just the the sewing and like it
brings up the thought of how we coexist

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000
brings up the thought of how we coexist
 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.710
brings up the thought of how we coexist
as communities and a lot of the the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720
as communities and a lot of the the
 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.320
as communities and a lot of the the
rules that we're learning to deal with

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330
rules that we're learning to deal with
 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.970
rules that we're learning to deal with
the immune system and to manipulate it

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980
the immune system and to manipulate it
 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.749
the immune system and to manipulate it
help us understand

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759
help us understand
 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.570
help us understand
how complex organizations work in

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580
how complex organizations work in
 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.490
how complex organizations work in

against viruses you can defend yourself

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180
against viruses you can defend yourself
 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.319
against viruses you can defend yourself
against terrorism that type of thing we

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329
against terrorism that type of thing we
 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.509
against terrorism that type of thing we
won't go there today but it is to say

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519
won't go there today but it is to say
 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.460
won't go there today but it is to say
that the types of things that we think

that the types of things that we think

that the types of things that we think
about frequently our fun are really

about frequently our fun are really
 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.960
about frequently our fun are really
fundamental questions that are

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970
fundamental questions that are
 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.880
fundamental questions that are
applicable in a university setting like

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890
applicable in a university setting like
 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.680
applicable in a university setting like
this in fact transplantation was the

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690
this in fact transplantation was the
 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.500
this in fact transplantation was the
field that determined what's alive and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510
field that determined what's alive and
 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.619
field that determined what's alive and
what's dead that up until nineteen

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629
what's dead that up until nineteen
 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.899
what's dead that up until nineteen
eighty there was not even an official

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:41.909
eighty there was not even an official
 

00:02:41.909 --> 00:02:43.940
eighty there was not even an official
definition of who's dead and who's alive

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950
definition of who's dead and who's alive
 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.629
definition of who's dead and who's alive
and that of course comes into great

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:47.639
and that of course comes into great
 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.160
and that of course comes into great
importance if you're going to be taking

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170
importance if you're going to be taking
 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.319
importance if you're going to be taking
parts from other individuals and using

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329
parts from other individuals and using
 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:54.170
parts from other individuals and using
them constructively to restore the

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180
them constructively to restore the
 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.319
them constructively to restore the
health of people who are ailing that you

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329
health of people who are ailing that you
 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.270
health of people who are ailing that you
have to have a fundamental definition of

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280
have to have a fundamental definition of
 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.610
have to have a fundamental definition of
death and and the fundamental definition

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620
death and and the fundamental definition
 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.860
death and and the fundamental definition
of death that we use now is one that

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870
of death that we use now is one that
 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.979
of death that we use now is one that
says that if your brain is dead then you

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989
says that if your brain is dead then you
 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.500
says that if your brain is dead then you
are dead but every other part is

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510
are dead but every other part is
 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.339
are dead but every other part is
optional in that regard just some food

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349
optional in that regard just some food
 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:22.009
optional in that regard just some food
for thought after lunch so the field of

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019
for thought after lunch so the field of
 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.339
for thought after lunch so the field of
transplantation actually has been with

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349
transplantation actually has been with
 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.069
transplantation actually has been with
us for four centuries if you go back in

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079
us for four centuries if you go back in
 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.159
us for four centuries if you go back in
mythology the the patron saints of

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169
mythology the the patron saints of
 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.229
mythology the the patron saints of
Physicians and Surgeons in the Catholic

this is a echar though oil on wood I

this is a echar though oil on wood I

this is a echar though oil on wood I
believe altarpiece showing the miracle

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109
believe altarpiece showing the miracle
 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.039
believe altarpiece showing the miracle
of cosmos and Damien which was really

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049
of cosmos and Damien which was really
 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.170
of cosmos and Damien which was really
one of the first limb transplants and so

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180
one of the first limb transplants and so
 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.520
one of the first limb transplants and so
people have been thinking about doing

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530
people have been thinking about doing
 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.409
people have been thinking about doing
limb transplants for as long as they've

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419
limb transplants for as long as they've
 

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.110
limb transplants for as long as they've
been thinking about sharing body parts

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120
been thinking about sharing body parts
 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.210
been thinking about sharing body parts
and so cosmos was the physician and

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220
and so cosmos was the physician and
 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.539
and so cosmos was the physician and
Damian was surgeon and you can see them

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549
Damian was surgeon and you can see them
 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.399
Damian was surgeon and you can see them
putting on the leg of a recently

00:04:04.399 --> 00:04:04.409
putting on the leg of a recently
 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:07.069
putting on the leg of a recently
deceased more to replace the gangrenous

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079
deceased more to replace the gangrenous
 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.479
deceased more to replace the gangrenous
leg of a nobleman and the event being

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489
leg of a nobleman and the event being
 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.439
leg of a nobleman and the event being
blessed eventually they were beheaded so

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449
blessed eventually they were beheaded so
 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.779
blessed eventually they were beheaded so
so this is probably the patron saint of

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789
so this is probably the patron saint of
 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.410
so this is probably the patron saint of
trial lawyers or

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420
 
 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.830
 
but the the point is is that it has

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840
but the the point is is that it has
 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.740
but the the point is is that it has
really been obvious to people that we

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750
really been obvious to people that we
 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.370
really been obvious to people that we
can trade off and become interchangeable

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380
can trade off and become interchangeable
 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.750
can trade off and become interchangeable
but it was not until just the last

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760
but it was not until just the last
 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.490
but it was not until just the last
century that it technically became

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500
century that it technically became
 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.160

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:33.240
interchangeable and the important aspect
of this is if now it is not so toxic to

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:33.250
of this is if now it is not so toxic to
 

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:35.649
of this is if now it is not so toxic to
transplantation you can start doing

00:08:35.649 --> 00:08:35.659
transplantation you can start doing
 

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:37.110

people's lives but to improve people's
 

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:42.240
people's lives but to improve people's
lives and when these types of

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:42.250
lives and when these types of
 

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:44.400
lives and when these types of
experiments started working I became

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:44.410
experiments started working I became
 

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.810
experiments started working I became
very interested in the topic of

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:47.820
very interested in the topic of
 

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.280
very interested in the topic of
composite vascular transplantation

minimize immunosuppression so that we

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:07.950
minimize immunosuppression so that we
 

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:09.620
minimize immunosuppression so that we
can balance a little better the

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:09.630
can balance a little better the
 

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:13.220

autotransplantation is really fast and

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:25.770
autotransplantation is really fast and
 

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:28.970
autotransplantation is really fast and
we have seen that the military injuries

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:28.980
we have seen that the military injuries
 

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.990
we have seen that the military injuries
have really increased the number of

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000
have really increased the number of
 

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.960
have really increased the number of

different type of reconstruction because
 

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.530
different type of reconstruction because
we have really modify the way that the

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:42.540
we have really modify the way that the
 

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.410
we have really modify the way that the
combat injuries have been because the

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:45.420
combat injuries have been because the
 

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.170

abdomen and thorax has has changed
 

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.590
abdomen and thorax has has changed
really the from lethal injuries to

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.600
really the from lethal injuries to
 

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.440
really the from lethal injuries to
surviving amputees and surviving people

00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:57.450
surviving amputees and surviving people
 

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.630
surviving amputees and surviving people
with burn injuries but we also have

00:11:59.630 --> 00:11:59.640
with burn injuries but we also have
 

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.460
with burn injuries but we also have
congenital malformations what these

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:01.470
congenital malformations what these
 

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.410
congenital malformations what these
could be applicable and we all already

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:03.420
could be applicable and we all already
 

00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:05.270
could be applicable and we all already
know that the number one cause of

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:05.280
know that the number one cause of
 

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.730
know that the number one cause of
disability in the United States is due

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:07.740
disability in the United States is due
 

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.580
disability in the United States is due
to rheumatoid conditions so this is also

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:10.590
to rheumatoid conditions so this is also
 

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.550
to rheumatoid conditions so this is also
a potential application in fact the very

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560
a potential application in fact the very
 

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.200
a potential application in fact the very
first time that I ever thought about a

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:15.210
first time that I ever thought about a
 

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.420
first time that I ever thought about a
hand transplant was in my last year of

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:17.430
hand transplant was in my last year of
 

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:21.140
hand transplant was in my last year of
medical school where I chose to do one

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:21.150
medical school where I chose to do one
 

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.570
medical school where I chose to do one
year of research and it was in

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:23.580
year of research and it was in
 

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.270
year of research and it was in
immunology or a mythology and on Fridays

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:26.280
immunology or a mythology and on Fridays
 

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.820
immunology or a mythology and on Fridays
was our multidisciplinary meeting and as

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:28.830
was our multidisciplinary meeting and as
 

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:31.010
was our multidisciplinary meeting and as
a medical student I was just sort of

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:31.020
a medical student I was just sort of
 

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.110
a medical student I was just sort of
looking at these patients with very

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120
looking at these patients with very
 

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.450
looking at these patients with very
severe deformities and the hand surgeons

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:35.460
severe deformities and the hand surgeons
 

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.150
severe deformities and the hand surgeons
you know doing as much corrective

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160
you know doing as much corrective
 

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.640
you know doing as much corrective
surgery as it was possible but it wasn't

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:40.650
surgery as it was possible but it wasn't
 

00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:43.250
surgery as it was possible but it wasn't
as good as we would like them the

00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.260
as good as we would like them the
 

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.070
as good as we would like them the
patients you know to recover

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:45.080
patients you know to recover
 

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.420
patients you know to recover
particularly on a condition which is non

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:47.430
particularly on a condition which is non
 

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.430

curable and that was the first time I

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:49.440
curable and that was the first time I
 

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:49.910

thought

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920
thought
 

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.190
thought
you know based pretty much of an

you know based pretty much of an
 

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.990
you know based pretty much of an
observation as a medical student I

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000
observation as a medical student I
 

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.629
observation as a medical student I
thought well you know what if we give

00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639
thought well you know what if we give
 

00:12:56.639 --> 00:12:58.269
thought well you know what if we give
them another option you know what if we

00:12:58.269 --> 00:12:58.279
them another option you know what if we
 

00:12:58.279 --> 00:13:00.290
them another option you know what if we
provide them with a hand you know

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:00.300
provide them with a hand you know
 

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.460
provide them with a hand you know

they're already on the immunosuppression
and that's you know probably how it all

00:13:04.879 --> 00:13:04.889
and that's you know probably how it all
 

00:13:04.889 --> 00:13:08.090
and that's you know probably how it all
started so based on the clinical need I

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:08.100
started so based on the clinical need I

we also wanted to move forward and
 

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:32.019
we also wanted to move forward and
established a way that we could sort of

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:45.510
and I walk into that room and I saw this
 

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:48.800
and I walk into that room and I saw this
girl who was two months old and her

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:48.810
girl who was two months old and her
 

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:51.740
girl who was two months old and her
mother was was holding her and so I

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:51.750
mother was was holding her and so I
 

00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:54.860
mother was was holding her and so I
walked in and and I knew why they call

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:54.870
walked in and and I knew why they call
 

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:57.860
walked in and and I knew why they call
me but I walked in and and of course you

00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:57.870
me but I walked in and and of course you
 

00:30:57.870 --> 00:31:00.320
me but I walked in and and of course you
know I saw mom with the baby looking at

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:00.330
know I saw mom with the baby looking at
 

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:03.110
know I saw mom with the baby looking at
me and and what I really was looking

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120
me and and what I really was looking
 

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.850
me and and what I really was looking
through that mom was really welcoming

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:07.860
through that mom was really welcoming
 

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.060
through that mom was really welcoming
the hope you know the hope that I was

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:11.070
the hope you know the hope that I was
 

00:31:11.070 --> 00:31:13.280
the hope you know the hope that I was
perhaps bringing at the moment I was

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:13.290
perhaps bringing at the moment I was
 

00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:15.470
perhaps bringing at the moment I was
walking in there which was the ability

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480
walking in there which was the ability
 

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:19.730
walking in there which was the ability
to give her back her limbs that she

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:19.740
to give her back her limbs that she
 

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:23.780
to give her back her limbs that she
would otherwise not recover when she was

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:23.790
would otherwise not recover when she was
 

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:26.960
would otherwise not recover when she was
two months old she got an infection and

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:26.970
two months old she got an infection and
 

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:31.430
two months old she got an infection and
lost both hands and both legs but to add

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440
lost both hands and both legs but to add
 

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:35.210
lost both hands and both legs but to add
complexity to this case her right side

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:35.220
complexity to this case her right side
 

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.280
complexity to this case her right side
it's actually this articulator at the

00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:37.290
it's actually this articulator at the
 

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:40.190
it's actually this articulator at the
hip so she can't even wear proceeds is

00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200
hip so she can't even wear proceeds is
 

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.830
hip so she can't even wear proceeds is
because there's really no way that the

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840
because there's really no way that the
 

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.560
because there's really no way that the
prosthetic device will actually be able

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:45.570
prosthetic device will actually be able
 

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:49.390
prosthetic device will actually be able
to be placed in her lower extremity so

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:49.400
to be placed in her lower extremity so
 

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.760
to be placed in her lower extremity so
so these are you know some of the other

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:52.770
so these are you know some of the other
 

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:56.390
so these are you know some of the other
challenges that we're facing but but we

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:56.400
challenges that we're facing but but we
 

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:58.760
challenges that we're facing but but we
have worked so far but but it's even

00:31:58.760 --> 00:31:58.770
have worked so far but but it's even
 

00:31:58.770 --> 00:32:00.680
have worked so far but but it's even
more complex than that it's not just the

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:00.690
more complex than that it's not just the
 

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:02.240
more complex than that it's not just the
application to the patient's it's not

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:02.250
application to the patient's it's not
 

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:06.010
application to the patient's it's not
pairing it with really strong science

00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:06.020
pairing it with really strong science
 

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:10.010
pairing it with really strong science
but but are all the is the

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:10.020
but but are all the is the
 

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:13.400
but but are all the is the
infrastructure really that we need to do

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:13.410
infrastructure really that we need to do
 

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:16.400
infrastructure really that we need to do
what we do and under vision of a place

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:16.410
what we do and under vision of a place
 

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:18.680
what we do and under vision of a place
such as these and that's why we are here

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:18.690
such as these and that's why we are here
 

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:24.470
such as these and that's why we are here

those challenges approach them on

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:26.500
those challenges approach them on
 

00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:30.510
those challenges approach them on
an advance and conquer them and I think

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:30.520
an advance and conquer them and I think
 

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.480
an advance and conquer them and I think
I'm right now I'm going to sort of

non-human primates to get them ready to
go into clinical trials and in fact in

00:34:46.649 --> 00:34:46.659
go into clinical trials and in fact in
 

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:49.770
go into clinical trials and in fact in
the last ten years there has only been

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:16.380
transplant patients participated in
 

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:18.500
transplant patients participated in
clinical trials which was the largest

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:18.510
clinical trials which was the largest
 

00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:21.799

fact this really gets back to the
fundamental nature of what we do that

00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839
fundamental nature of what we do that
 

00:35:30.839 --> 00:35:33.140
fundamental nature of what we do that
every transplant patient understands

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:33.150
every transplant patient understands
 

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:36.319
every transplant patient understands
altruism in a way that no one else can

00:35:36.319 --> 00:35:36.329
altruism in a way that no one else can
 

00:35:36.329 --> 00:35:38.809
altruism in a way that no one else can
understand it they can't do anything

00:35:38.809 --> 00:35:38.819
understand it they can't do anything
 

00:35:38.819 --> 00:35:41.120
understand it they can't do anything
without the altruism of someone else and

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:41.130
without the altruism of someone else and
 

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:43.579
without the altruism of someone else and
so when you ask them would you like to

00:35:43.579 --> 00:35:43.589
so when you ask them would you like to
 

00:35:43.589 --> 00:35:47.930
so when you ask them would you like to
participate in changing the future they

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:47.940
participate in changing the future they
 

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.510
participate in changing the future they
buy a large sign up and that's one of

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520
buy a large sign up and that's one of
 

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.599
buy a large sign up and that's one of
the reasons why just in the last two

00:35:53.599 --> 00:35:53.609
the reasons why just in the last two
 

00:35:53.609 --> 00:35:57.440
the reasons why just in the last two
years we've put together a project that

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:57.450
years we've put together a project that
 

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:59.930
years we've put together a project that
is incorporated 1,400 transplant

00:35:59.930 --> 00:35:59.940
is incorporated 1,400 transplant
 

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.990
is incorporated 1,400 transplant
patients and 80,000 specimens to build a

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000
patients and 80,000 specimens to build a
 

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.859
patients and 80,000 specimens to build a
library of every disease that the basic

00:36:06.859 --> 00:36:06.869
library of every disease that the basic
 

00:36:06.869 --> 00:36:08.480
library of every disease that the basic
scientists can then go in and withdraw

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:08.490
scientists can then go in and withdraw
 

00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:10.579
scientists can then go in and withdraw
specimens so they don't have to you know

00:36:10.579 --> 00:36:10.589
specimens so they don't have to you know
 

00:36:10.589 --> 00:36:12.829
specimens so they don't have to you know
reinvent the clinical trial every time

00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839
reinvent the clinical trial every time
 

00:36:12.839 --> 00:36:14.809
reinvent the clinical trial every time
so now if one of our basic scientist

00:36:14.809 --> 00:36:14.819
so now if one of our basic scientist
 

00:36:14.819 --> 00:36:16.490
so now if one of our basic scientist
wants to study rejection they just go

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:16.500
wants to study rejection they just go
 

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.620
wants to study rejection they just go
and they withdraw 10 rejections and they

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:18.630
and they withdraw 10 rejections and they
 

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:19.910
and they withdraw 10 rejections and they
check it out and then you go and do

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920
check it out and then you go and do
 

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.589
check it out and then you go and do
their experiment and it cuts three years

00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599
their experiment and it cuts three years
 

00:36:21.599 --> 00:36:24.220
their experiment and it cuts three years
and millions of dollars off the project

00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:24.230
and millions of dollars off the project
 

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:26.660
and millions of dollars off the project
and that's just something that couldn't

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:26.670
and that's just something that couldn't
 

00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:28.280
and that's just something that couldn't
exist somewhere else something that a

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:28.290
exist somewhere else something that a
 

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:30.500
exist somewhere else something that a
memory should be very proud of I think

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:30.510

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:32.839
memory should be very proud of I think
that that's been recognized in our

that that's been recognized in our
ability to lead National trials now so

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:35.369
ability to lead National trials now so
 

00:36:35.369 --> 00:36:38.059

Emery now leads those two trials so also

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:53.130
