The Golden Globes
were last night,

00:00:02.536 --> 00:00:05.105
and the stars were out in force
for Hollywood's fifth or

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:06.340
sixth biggest platform

00:00:06.373 --> 00:00:08.075
for actors
to make political statements

00:00:08.108 --> 00:00:09.476
instead of just
accepting their awards.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.812
Uh, to recap... to recap...

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.814
Casey Affleck appeared
to have been bitten by

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:19.286
-a radioactive rabbi, and...
-(laughter, applause)

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:22.856
And everyone loved <i>La La Land,</i>

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.292
the feel-good musical
that was set in L.A.

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:28.028
that proves that anyone can make
it as long as you got

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:29.997
a song in your heart,
a dance in your step,

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.266
and you're two of the most
attractive people on the planet.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:33.834
(laughter)

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:37.538
Now, in case you didn't know,
<i>Hidden Figures</i> and <i>Fences</i>

00:00:37.571 --> 00:00:39.640
are two
entirely different movies

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:41.508
featuring African-American leads

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.710
that both received
multiple nominations.

00:00:43.744 --> 00:00:45.412
But shh! Don't tell that

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:48.382
to red carpet reporter
Jenna Bush Hager. Shh!

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:51.218
So, you're nominated
for <i>Hidden Fences.</i>

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.086
How cool is it?
You said

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.189
that this party's known
for a little drinking.

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:57.457
Are you thinking
you're going to partake?

00:00:57.491 --> 00:01:00.394
-(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)
-I mean...

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:02.963
-I mean, Pharrell's not even...
-BETSY BRANDT: Oh, my God!

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:06.233
-(bleep)
-He's not even angry.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.903
-You just hear him deflate.
You know this... -(laughter)

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:12.039
The only thing this was missing

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.842
was the <i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i>
music sting. Watch.

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:17.411
So you're nominated
for <i>Hidden Fences.</i>

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.446
(theme music for
<i>Curb Your Enthusiasm</i> plays)

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.149
(laughter, applause)

00:01:22.182 --> 00:01:24.685
Ah! <i>Curb.</i>

00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:27.254
Your music makes
everything better,

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:28.956
-including porn.
-Oh, my God.

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:30.891
-BRANDT: Oh, my God!
-Now, I know this looks bad,

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.559
but let's give her
the benefit of the doubt.

00:01:32.593 --> 00:01:33.927
You know, <i>Hidden Fences</i> is...

00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:35.462
Maybe it's a real movie
somewhere.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:38.065
Maybe that is a real movie
somewhere.

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:40.734
Comedians, give us the tag line
for <i>Hidden Fences....</i>

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.402
Dan.

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:46.340
Um, will Stevie Wonder be able
to get his lawnmower business

00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:50.777
off the ground and avoid all
the obstacles in suburbia?

00:01:50.811 --> 00:01:53.881
Tune into Lifetime
original movie <i>Hidden Fences.</i>

00:01:53.914 --> 00:01:56.083
(laughter, applause)

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:59.720
I mean, I think you just
sold the show, Dan.

00:01:59.753 --> 00:02:01.788
You just sold the show.
Points to that.

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:03.357
-Betsy.
-BRANDT: Okay.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.659
I have not seen <i>Hidden Fences,</i>

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:09.229
but I know all you have to say
is that it's very important.

00:02:09.263 --> 00:02:09.329
It's very important. Yeah.
