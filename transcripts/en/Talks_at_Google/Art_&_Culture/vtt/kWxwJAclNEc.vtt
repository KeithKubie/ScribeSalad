[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.827 --> 00:00:12.160
PETER FETTERMAN: Thank you, Ben.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.310
It's great to be back at Google.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.930
I was reading one
of my favorite books

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.640
last night, which
I always do when

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.350
I get to interview someone very
accomplished and distinguished.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.120
It's a book by
Viktor Frankl called

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.000
"Man's Search for Meaning."

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.100
And there was a
passage I reflected on,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.190
which I think is very
relevant to today.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.530
He said, "Don't aim at success.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.680
The more you aim at it
and make it a target,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.870
the more you are
going to miss it.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.980
For success, like happiness,
cannot be pursued.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.960
It must ensue, and it only
does so as the unintended side

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.070
effect of one's personal
dedication to a cause

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.660
greater than one's self."

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.660
Steve, what do you
think your cause is?

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.060
Pretty tough, beautiful words.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.570
STEVE MCCURRY: No,
that's very profound.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.590
My life has been--

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.260
I think it's been a dream.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.270
It's been wonderful.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.110
My ambition-- and when
I was 19, I left town,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.840
went to live in
Europe for a year.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.560
And I decided, after
spending that year wandering

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.610
around Europe, I wanted to
travel for the rest of my life.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.520
I thought this was great
to go to new places,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.520
new cultures, meet
new people, see

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.657
how things are done differently
in other parts of the world.

00:01:39.657 --> 00:01:41.740
PETER FETTERMAN: Was it a
kind of escape from you,

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.769
from your environment,
from your home?

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:45.560
Did you feel restricted
by your upbringing?

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.185
STEVE MCCURRY: I had
a great childhood.

00:01:47.185 --> 00:01:47.980
I was happy.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.100
I had friends.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.730
Once I started traveling,
I just realized

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.650
there was this big world out
there with incredible beauty

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.310
and architecture.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.040
And I just wanted to see it all.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.020
I wanted to go to
the Grand Canyon.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.000
I wanted to go to
see the Taj Mahal.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.480
I wanted to go to China.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.610
I wanted to go to Africa and
see what's happening there.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.037
PETER FETTERMAN: You had this
wanderlust from a young age.

00:02:20.037 --> 00:02:20.870
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.110
But I realized that
I can't just travel--

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.060
first of all, I had
to make a living.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.580
But I needed some purpose.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.530
I needed to find a way to do
something in addition just

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.460
to travel.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.490
So I went back to school.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:46.600
I fell into a film
course at the university.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.660
And in studying filmmaking,
cinematography, I took a class

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.160
in still photography.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.240
And it was at that point
the light bulb went off.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.760
And I thought, this was the
way that I could potentially

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.050
travel, make a living.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.895
So I basically got a job on a
newspaper for a couple years

00:03:12.895 --> 00:03:20.260
in 1974, saved my money, and
got a one-way ticket to India,

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.950
and basically never looked back.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.210
I left in '78.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.870
And I've been basically
traveling ever since.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.270
PETER FETTERMAN: Did you
have photographic heroes?

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.630
STEVE MCCURRY: Well,
that first film course

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.540
I took, there was a big library
with tons of photography books.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.150
So I started poring
over all of these.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.750
And I think that one of the
great pleasures in life,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.480
as a photographer, is
going through past work.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.730
And the work that really
spoke to me in a very deep way

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.840
was photographers like
Andre Kertesz, Walker Evans,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.300
Dorothea Lange, Eugene Smith.

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.140
But I have to say, the one
that-- and Elliott Erwitt,

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.940
of course, who has
become a friend.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.720
But the one photographer
who, in a way,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.840
was head and shoulders,
for me, above all

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.487
the other photographers
was Henri Cartier-Bresson.

00:04:16.487 --> 00:04:18.820
PETER FETTERMAN: What did he
have that the others didn't

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.260
have as much of?

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.840
STEVE MCCURRY: Well, Henri
traveled to all these places

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.090
that I wanted to go to.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.790
He had a great sense of
composition and shape

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:39.760
and beautiful geometry,
great humanity,

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.850
great stories in his
pictures about ordinary life.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.510
And it's very difficult.

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.170
It's easy-- not
easy, but it's less--

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:54.760
well, to make a great
picture in your hometown

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.860
on the street of
just common life

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.880
is a very difficult thing to do.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.910
And then, of course, he had this
great sense of timing and sense

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.270
of the decisive moment,
which was a term that he

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.800
used to describe his work.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.360
But he had a great
eye, great heart,

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.640
and made just great pictures.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.849
And I thought, this
is the kind of work

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:20.890
that really speaks to me.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.682
And this is the kind of
photographer I want to emulate.

00:05:23.682 --> 00:05:26.140
PETER FETTERMAN: And when you
finally ended up meeting him,

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:27.050
how was that?

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.590
That first meeting,
were you intimidated?

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.577
Were you, oh, my god,
I'm meeting Rembrandt?

00:05:31.577 --> 00:05:32.410
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.720
I was extremely
intimidated, because I knew

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.770
that he could be really tough.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.330
I wouldn't say cruel, but
he could be a bit rude

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.360
if he didn't like the work.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:55.282
So I went to see him and his
wife Martine, took my book.

00:05:55.282 --> 00:05:56.740
And I thought, this
is either going

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.324
to be the beginning
or the end of my--

00:05:58.324 --> 00:05:59.323
PETER FETTERMAN: Career.

00:05:59.323 --> 00:06:00.370
STEVE MCCURRY: --career.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.920
And he was very complimentary.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.020
It was just the three of us--
myself, Martine, and Henri.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.160
He had very kind things to say.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.720
We talked about India, because
he had spent a lot of time

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.650
there.

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:21.220
And I have to say that I'm
really quite proud to--

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.210
in your gallery now, you have
some of my work on the wall.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.300
But you also have a significant
amount of Henri's pictures

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:29.826
on the wall.

00:06:29.826 --> 00:06:31.950
PETER FETTERMAN: They seem
to complement each other

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:32.740
very well.

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.759
STEVE MCCURRY: Well, I
don't collect photography

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:37.300
by and large.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.230
But the first
photograph I bought

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.089
was one of Henri's pictures.

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:45.130
PETER FETTERMAN: Me, too.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.550
That's what got me
addicted to photography.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:54.490
STEVE MCCURRY: And
this is 20 years ago.

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:58.710
I wish I had bought
more, because it's just,

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:06.025
for me, some of the most
iconic work in photography.

00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:07.150
PETER FETTERMAN: Why India?

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:09.850
You spent so much of your
time and your career in India.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.460
What keeps bringing
you back there?

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.470
STEVE MCCURRY: Well,
as I mentioned,

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:17.140
I spent a year in Europe.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.580
I was in Sweden.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:27.010
I worked in Amsterdam doing odd
jobs, traveled around Europe.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.920
So when I started
my freelance career,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.980
I wanted to go somewhere.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.155
I had been to Africa on
another trip and Latin America.

00:07:35.155 --> 00:07:38.410
So I thought, OK, where
can I really launch

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.300
this freelance career?

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:43.150
So I thought-- Russia was
difficult at that time

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:43.870
in the late '70s.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:47.815
China was also a bit
difficult to get into.

00:07:47.815 --> 00:07:48.880
So I thought, India.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.500
India's rich, has so many
different cultures, religions,

00:07:53.500 --> 00:08:01.040
geography, and disparity
between extreme rich and poor,

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:08.090
between people living in the
ultramodern and people living

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:12.280
in kind of an ancient
way-- living in villages

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.980
without electricity and without
running water and all that.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.470
So I thought, I'll go to India.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:18.610
I'll go for a few weeks.

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.950
And then I'll move
to different regions.

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:26.270
So that few week trip
turned into two years.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:31.510
I literally stayed in
India for two years.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:37.840
And I was just astonished at
how incredible this country was.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.289
I lived through two monsoons.

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:45.520
I had, as an
11-year-old boy, seen

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:49.990
the work of Brian Brake, who
had done this incredible essay

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:52.660
on the monsoon.

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.160
So I had lived
through two monsoons.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:59.350
I thought, this is
a dramatic moment.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:01.930
PETER FETTERMAN: Where do you
get your fearlessness from?

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.590
You go into these
extraordinary situations.

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:13.165
STEVE MCCURRY: Well, I've
always hated being timid.

00:09:13.165 --> 00:09:16.030
I remember in the
monsoon, I tried

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:19.297
to avoid getting into the water.

00:09:19.297 --> 00:09:21.130
Because in the water
there are dead animals,

00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:24.490
and there was all kinds
of crap in the water.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:25.570
So I had boots.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.430
And I tried to work from a boat.

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:31.150
And in the end I decided
that if I'm really

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.240
going to do this
story in the best way,

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.590
I'm going to have to
get into that muck.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:39.910
So I did that.

00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:42.727
I spent days in flooded regions.

00:09:42.727 --> 00:09:44.560
PETER FETTERMAN: Do you
do a lot of research

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.780
before you go to a
specific location,

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.036
or do you just get there
and just breathe the moment?

00:09:50.036 --> 00:09:51.910
STEVE MCCURRY: I do a
little bit of research.

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:57.340
I want to know, in general,
the best places to go,

00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.950
the places that are going
to interest me the most.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:04.810
But I try not to
over-research, because I always

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.840
find I'm disappointed.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.140
I talk about a particular area.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:10.480
And I'm looking for something.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.940
And I get there, and
it's no longer there.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.490
Things change-- these
guide books and whatever.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.450
So I've decided maybe it's
just better to go cold

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.760
and just to discover
things once you get there.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.700
Everything is fresh and new.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.000
PETER FETTERMAN: What strikes
me the most about looking

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.100
at your work over
all these years

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:33.460
is the incredible empathy
you have for your subject.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.750
Do you feel a great
responsibility

00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:39.017
towards the people
you're photographing?

00:10:39.017 --> 00:10:39.850
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:43.720
I've always felt that we
always need to treat people

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.900
with dignity and respect.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:52.810
And no matter how
poor people look,

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:58.790
we need to try to meet them and
understand how they're living.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:04.510
And often, you have to break
down that distance between you

00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:05.670
and them.

00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:08.710
And you have to try and--

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:10.900
so often, photographers--
I see students when

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:12.640
I'm on workshops--

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.940
they try and stay at
arm's length to the people

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.080
that they're photographing.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.110
I think you really have
to wade in and meet

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:26.380
people and joke with people
and really spend time.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:29.191
And then I think a
whole world opens up.

00:11:29.191 --> 00:11:30.940
PETER FETTERMAN: So
you can't be detached.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.780
You can't be--

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:34.330
STEVE MCCURRY: No,
you have to want

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:39.310
to really get in and literally
meet people, talk to people,

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.990
walk into a shop or
restaurant, sit down--

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:45.250
or in a neighborhood and
talk to people on the street.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:48.790
And even if you don't
have a translator

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:51.790
and you're there by
yourself, you can always--

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:57.610
just by hand gestures or just
by joking around with people.

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:02.485
It's amazing how far you can go
with nonverbal communication--

00:12:02.485 --> 00:12:07.420
a smile, something.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.990
You can achieve
everything just by a smile

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:16.000
and by showing people
that you're at their level

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.050
and that you're not
some arrogant tourist

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:23.984
with a big camera and a taxi
waiting for you and all that.

00:12:23.984 --> 00:12:25.900
PETER FETTERMAN: Many
of your strongest images

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.160
have children in them.

00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.200
Is that a conscious
decision, or are you

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.719
just attracted to their
vulnerability, their emotion?

00:12:32.719 --> 00:12:34.010
STEVE MCCURRY: I love children.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:39.050
I think that they're so
innocent, and they're so pure.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:43.150
And there's no veneer.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:44.740
They're just there.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:49.980
And they're happy,
or they're sad.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.680
And often, they're very playful.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:59.410
And I just think that
working with children

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.935
is so much fun,
because they're so--

00:13:01.935 --> 00:13:04.060
PETER FETTERMAN: Let's look
at an image of a child.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.230
This is a pretty famous
child in your life.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.610
How did this come about?

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:13.300
STEVE MCCURRY: Well,
this was at the time

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:18.760
when there were about three
million Afghan refugees living

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.890
in Pakistan and Iran.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:25.890
So I was doing this
story on the border

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:27.190
of Pakistan, Afghanistan.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:30.550
And one morning, I
wandered through the camp.

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:31.720
It was about 11 o'clock.

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.600
I was almost on the verge
of quitting and going back

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.850
to the hotel and having lunch.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:37.720
PETER FETTERMAN:
You were frustrated.

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.890
You didn't see anything.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:39.520
STEVE MCCURRY: I
wasn't frustrated,

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.470
but the light was really harsh.

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:44.230
I'd already been there
for three or four hours.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:47.090
And I thought, let me take
a break, because it was hot

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:48.710
and the sun's really bright.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:51.920
I don't like to work
in really bright light.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:55.730
So as I was walking
through the camp,

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.050
I noticed these voices
coming from a tent.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:00.550
It was a school.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.050
So I wandered over.

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.710
I thought, maybe I'll check
this out before I head out.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:10.930
So this girls' school--
so I looked in.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:16.120
And the first thing I
noticed off in the corner

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.730
was this little girl
with this incredible look

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.310
and these amazing eyes.

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:26.290
So I asked the teacher if I
could come in, photograph.

00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:27.590
So I had a permit.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:28.540
I had permission.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:35.320
And she told me to come in.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.040
But I knew that the
main objective was

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.002
to get a picture of this girl.

00:14:42.002 --> 00:14:43.960
PETER FETTERMAN: So it
was love at first sight.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.220
There was an instant.

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:47.920
You saw something really
special about this kid and not

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:49.500
the other 50 kids there.

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.860
STEVE MCCURRY: I said, there is
an incredible portrait there.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:15:02.290
So what I did was I thought--
because if I go right to her,

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:06.070
she might get too
shy and refuse--

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.060
lost.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:12.975
So I decided to photograph
some of the other students,

00:15:12.975 --> 00:15:18.130
almost to the point where
she would feel excluded.

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:22.330
And so eventually,
I came around and--

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:24.430
PETER FETTERMAN: You
used child psychology.

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:24.620
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah.

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:25.600
That's it exactly.

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.800
Yeah.

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.690
So I finally came to her.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.951
So she came and sat down
in front of my lens.

00:15:33.951 --> 00:15:35.950
PETER FETTERMAN: Never
seen a camera, I presume?

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.500
STEVE MCCURRY: Never seen a
camera, never met a foreigner,

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.400
and had no idea
about photography.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:51.460
I think part of the look is
curiosity, maybe wondering, who

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:54.190
am I, who is this
photographer, why is he dressed

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:56.710
in a funny way, and what kind
of language is he speaking,

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.590
and what is this
camera, and all that.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:05.220
So I took maybe
10 or 15 pictures.

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.410
And at first, she was a bit shy.

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:10.870
She had her hands
up to her face.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.660
And the teacher
explained to her,

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.390
we've got to cooperate
with this guy,

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:19.750
because he's telling
our story to the world,

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.410
because our village has
been destroyed, et cetera.

00:16:23.410 --> 00:16:27.240
So then she dropped her hands.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:32.260
And I shifted my
camera off to the side

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.070
to get better light on her face,
which was natural light coming

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:38.590
from outside the tent.

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:42.130
And I took just a few pictures.

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.220
And as I was in the middle
of the most important shoot

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:50.950
of my life, she got up and
thought, OK, that was fun.

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:51.996
That's over.

00:16:51.996 --> 00:16:54.120
PETER FETTERMAN: When you
create an image like this

00:16:54.120 --> 00:17:01.535
that has this universal appeal,
acceptance, iconic stature,

00:17:01.535 --> 00:17:04.890
do you feel you have to
live up to create something

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:08.720
as great as that every
time you start to shoot?

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.094
Is it a burden as
well as a blessing?

00:17:11.094 --> 00:17:12.510
STEVE MCCURRY:
I've only ever seen

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:20.970
it as positive and completely
humbled and grateful

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.790
that I was able to
make this picture.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:28.799
And it's due mostly to her for--

00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:30.840
PETER FETTERMAN: Well,
it's due to you perceiving

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.400
that she had something special
and that connects with people.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.270
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah.

00:17:36.270 --> 00:17:38.394
PETER FETTERMAN: It's one
of the most famous photos

00:17:38.394 --> 00:17:41.953
in the 20th century
history, isn't it?

00:17:41.953 --> 00:17:44.080
STEVE MCCURRY: If
you say so, yeah.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.110
PETER FETTERMAN:
Along with D-Day.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.806
STEVE MCCURRY: But just to--

00:17:48.806 --> 00:17:49.680
if you could go back.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.620
I don't know if you can go back.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:58.740
It's one of these cases where
everything lined up perfectly.

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.630
The stars were in a
complete alignment--

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:03.750
the background, the
color of the background,

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:09.810
the green shawl had a nice
complementary color to it.

00:18:09.810 --> 00:18:11.820
And everything was just perfect.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:17.400
And it just happened
that way, and the light

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.191
happened to be just right.

00:18:19.191 --> 00:18:20.940
PETER FETTERMAN: Why
do you feel everybody

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:25.380
connected to it in a way that
was pretty unprecedented?

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:31.380
STEVE MCCURRY: I think it's
because she's very pretty,

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:37.350
but there's a look which is very
direct, very almost haunted.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:39.030
You can tell that
she's a bit poor

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:42.240
but that she has this
incredible dignity to her.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.380
And she's going to power through
whatever problems she has.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:49.770
I think even if you don't
know that she's a refugee,

00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:55.392
I still think there is a
power to her expression.

00:18:55.392 --> 00:18:56.850
PETER FETTERMAN:
You connect to it,

00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:00.380
and you feel her vulnerability,
and it's very humbling.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:02.190
As is this photo,
this is probably

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:04.620
my favorite photo of yours.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:05.890
How did this come about?

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:13.990
STEVE MCCURRY: I was on my
way to my hotel in Bombay.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.350
On the way from the
airport, there's

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:20.644
probably 50 traffic lights you
have to go through to get--

00:19:20.644 --> 00:19:22.310
and at each traffic
light, often there's

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.540
people who come up
and ask for money.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:27.300
And this woman came
up with her child.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:33.420
And she was looking in
through this fogged window.

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:36.330
And she's looking at me,
and I'm looking at her.

00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:41.250
And I just instinctually
took two exposures.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.260
And then the light changed.

00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.300
And we sped off.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:51.120
But it's this two worlds.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:54.220
She's in the traffic and
the heat and the rain.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:59.010
And I'm in this air
conditioned bubble.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:03.350
And it's just for that moment
we had this connection.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:08.850
And the color works, in
terms of the picture.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.725
And this little
child's looking at me.

00:20:11.725 --> 00:20:14.100
PETER FETTERMAN: What's the
saddest situation you've ever

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:16.820
found yourself in
after all these years?

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:19.770
STEVE MCCURRY: Well, probably
working in these refugee camps,

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:26.310
whether it was in Lebanon
or Kashmir or Sri Lanka

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:31.330
or Thailand or Lebanon, Syria.

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:34.834
These are places where
these people have lived,

00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:36.000
maybe had a very happy life.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:42.660
I know in Afghanistan people had
very large homes in the village

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:45.350
and had a really wonderful life.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.730
And then there's these camps.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:51.090
And they're suddenly stuck in
a tent and crammed together.

00:20:51.090 --> 00:20:57.030
And their whole way of life
is uprooted and basically has

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:57.820
been destroyed.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.780
So I can't imagine
what it would be

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:04.860
like to be driven from your
home and then have to go live

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:09.030
in a foreign country and just
live at the mercy of people's

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:09.760
charity.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.301
PETER FETTERMAN: Do
you feel you have

00:21:11.301 --> 00:21:14.430
to emotionally detach
yourself at times in order

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:16.050
to take the photograph?

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.230
STEVE MCCURRY: It's
hard to do that.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:27.570
But I do think you
have to remind yourself

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:30.930
that this is an
important story that

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:33.120
needs to be shown to the world.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.090
Their story has
to get out there.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:37.530
People need to be
informed about what's

00:21:37.530 --> 00:21:41.460
going on in our world,
like Syria, for instance.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.350
And without people
to tell that story,

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:47.070
these people are voiceless.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:51.165
So that has to be
more important than--

00:21:51.165 --> 00:21:53.040
PETER FETTERMAN: Whatever
you're particularly

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:53.970
feeling at that moment?

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:54.630
STEVE MCCURRY: Exactly.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:55.171
That's right.

00:21:55.171 --> 00:21:56.040
Yeah.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:00.900
So I think that's the toughest--

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:04.290
PETER FETTERMAN: This seems
a happy situation for you.

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:05.040
Was it?

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:07.930
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah.

00:22:07.930 --> 00:22:12.170
And as a wandering
street photographer,

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:22.230
often you come around a corner
and you see a composition.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:27.050
Photographers have been doing
this for the last 100 years.

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:30.950
But you recognize that as
people are coming and going

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:37.130
from this composition that
the person or an animal

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:41.930
or whatever that comes
through completes the picture.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:45.020
So in this case,
it just so happened

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:51.350
that in India, after this
festival called Holi,

00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:54.500
somebody put all these
handprints on the wall.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.850
And this was a very
well-traveled alleyway.

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:01.220
And there were people
coming and going.

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:02.240
There were vendors.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.215
There were cows.

00:23:06.354 --> 00:23:08.270
So I just stood there,
and I was photographing

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.510
people coming into my frame and
people going out of my frame.

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:14.329
I stood there for, I don't
know, maybe an hour, maybe

00:23:14.329 --> 00:23:15.620
an hour and a half, maybe more.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:20.300
And then went back at night and
started looking at my pictures

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.635
and decided, I think
this has great potential.

00:23:23.635 --> 00:23:25.010
So I went back
again the next day

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:27.680
and spent another bit of time.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:35.810
But again, the colors and
that edge of the okra,

00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:39.195
just I thought it
was a great moment.

00:23:39.195 --> 00:23:41.320
PETER FETTERMAN: In everything
you've photographed,

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:46.610
did you feel the human spirit
is essentially good or bad?

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:51.700
STEVE MCCURRY: I think
it's basically good.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:58.430
There's a lot of evil forces
and bad actors out there.

00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:01.550
But I think that basically
you meet people on the street,

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.490
and people are generally
kind and hospitable

00:24:03.490 --> 00:24:05.420
and willing to be photographed.

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.750
Wherever I've gone in the
world, nine times out of 10,

00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:15.350
if you approach
people with a smile,

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:17.990
people are more
than happy to agree

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.625
to have their portrait taken.

00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:22.250
PETER FETTERMAN: Has there ever
been a situation where you just

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:24.200
couldn't take the
photograph because what

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:28.499
you were in front of was
so emotionally disturbing?

00:24:28.499 --> 00:24:30.290
STEVE MCCURRY: That
only happened one time.

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:31.623
PETER FETTERMAN: Where was that?

00:24:31.623 --> 00:24:36.080
STEVE MCCURRY: That was on
the banks of the Ganges.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:42.920
And it's very common for
people to be cremated.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:45.080
And sometimes they can't
afford to be cremated.

00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.500
They just throw their
bodies into the river.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:53.585
And there were some dogs.

00:24:57.290 --> 00:25:00.500
And I thought,
whoa, I can't even

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.990
look at that, let
alone photograph it.

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:04.900
So I walked away from that.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:12.890
But again, treating people--
always being respectful.

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:17.840
I think you need
to make the picture

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.770
and then decide
afterward whether you

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:25.160
should pass it along and print
it or publish it or whatever.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:30.150
But I always am very
respectful of people's--

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:32.720
if there's a funeral,
if there's a death,

00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.990
I think you have to be
really, really careful

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:39.430
and not overstep
that line where you--

00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:41.180
PETER FETTERMAN: It
might be in bad taste,

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.919
as we say in the first world.

00:25:42.919 --> 00:25:44.210
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah, bad taste.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:49.790
And this may be the most
tragic moment of their life.

00:25:49.790 --> 00:25:53.700
And you just have to be
very respectful of that

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.550
and evaluate moment to moment--

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:57.800
is this the right thing to do?

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.170
Should I make this picture?

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:04.070
Sometimes they want
you to photograph them,

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:06.560
because they want
that story told.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:07.760
But sometimes they don't.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.264
So you just have to be able
to read that situation.

00:26:10.264 --> 00:26:12.680
PETER FETTERMAN: So you're
always walking on a moral line.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.450
STEVE MCCURRY: Every moment.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:18.200
One moment, it could be
the right thing to do.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.190
And then things shift,
and you have to adjust.

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:28.130
So your internal
computer's always

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:31.534
readjusting and recalibrating.

00:26:31.534 --> 00:26:33.200
PETER FETTERMAN:
Another magical image--

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.469
how did this come about?

00:26:34.469 --> 00:26:36.260
STEVE MCCURRY: Well,
as I say, I was really

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:40.010
inspired by Brian Brake,
because the monsoon was

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.600
such a dramatic weather event.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:46.470
It was either too much rain and
you had floods, or not enough

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:47.660
and you had drought.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:51.009
And people living in these
agricultural countries really

00:26:51.009 --> 00:26:51.800
depend on the rain.

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.810
It's no joke.

00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:58.880
So I went to India weeks
before the onset of the rain,

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:03.640
because I wanted to get the
build-up of the heat, the dust,

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:08.570
the hot wind, which is the
prelude to the monsoon.

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:12.650
And so I was driving to the
desert going between, I think,

00:27:12.650 --> 00:27:18.380
Jodhpur and Jaisalmer, and this
enormous dust storm came up out

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.780
of nowhere.

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:23.540
And my first inclination was to
roll the windows up of the car

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.582
and try and hunker down.

00:27:25.582 --> 00:27:27.290
So I didn't want to
get my cameras dusty.

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:29.150
Then I realized,
wait a minute, I'm

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:32.664
actually supposed to
be shooting all this.

00:27:32.664 --> 00:27:34.580
So then I started looking
around for something

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:37.550
to photograph, some people.

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:41.060
And then as I was
getting desperate,

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:48.359
I saw these women, who had
been working, huddled together.

00:27:48.359 --> 00:27:50.150
PETER FETTERMAN: What
were they working at?

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:50.765
What were they doing?

00:27:50.765 --> 00:27:52.556
STEVE MCCURRY: Well,
during the dry season,

00:27:52.556 --> 00:27:54.950
just before the
monsoon, the government

00:27:54.950 --> 00:28:00.830
has these programs where they
employ thousands of villagers

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:03.720
to work on the road or dig--

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.580
PETER FETTERMAN: It's
like a WPA project.

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:06.413
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah.

00:28:06.413 --> 00:28:08.990
So they were doing this work.

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:12.440
And they were huddled
together, I guess,

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:14.360
just because it was
windy and dusty.

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:19.220
And I ran across the field.

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:20.360
I made a few pictures.

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:23.750
And then the wind stopped.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:26.960
And they went back to
work, and it was over.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.470
So you can't hesitate.

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:31.280
You have to seize the moment.

00:28:34.939 --> 00:28:36.480
PETER FETTERMAN: I
have to thank you,

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:38.580
because you turned me
on to color photography.

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:43.530
I was a terrible black and
white snob before I met you.

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:46.090
And you just can't conceive
of these images we've been

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:49.780
looking at in black and white.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:53.550
They just wouldn't have the
power and the luminosity

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:56.240
and the impact.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.800
So I thank you for
turning me on to color.

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:01.110
What's going on here?

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:04.146
STEVE MCCURRY:
Well, I always felt

00:29:04.146 --> 00:29:05.520
it was more logical
to photograph

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.980
in color, because the
world is in color.

00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:10.950
And so much of the
story, if you go

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:17.420
to a Tibetan monastery or Hindu
temple, a lot of the cultural--

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.980
it's so much cultural
information in color.

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:24.410
So it makes more sense for me to
photograph the world in color.

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:28.680
So I was in Burma
on the west coast.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:32.950
There was this ship
that had run aground.

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:36.750
So you had this really surreal
situation where these children

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:40.510
are playing with a ball.

00:29:40.510 --> 00:29:43.000
There's this ship
that's run aground.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.970
And it was actually really heavy
rain when I took this picture.

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:50.116
But you can't see the
rain, because it's--

00:29:50.116 --> 00:29:53.780
you need a dark background
to see the water.

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:59.620
But I just thought it was these
children floating out there.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:04.020
And the surf was only
a couple inches deep.

00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:07.410
And they're playing
there, having a great time

00:30:07.410 --> 00:30:10.695
during the monsoon, and
not a care in the world.

00:30:10.695 --> 00:30:13.399
It looked like so much fun.

00:30:13.399 --> 00:30:15.815
PETER FETTERMAN: Would you say
it's a happy photo for you?

00:30:15.815 --> 00:30:16.648
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah.

00:30:16.648 --> 00:30:19.080
I like dark, moody pictures.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:22.750
I've always been
attracted more to the--

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:29.790
for color, the color's muted,
dark, more low contrast.

00:30:29.790 --> 00:30:32.160
For me, it works
better than bright sun.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.630
I never work in the bright sun.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:40.330
Yeah.

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:44.180
I'm actually very
proud of this picture.

00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:46.350
This picture no longer exists.

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:48.621
There's no more steam
locomotives in India.

00:30:48.621 --> 00:30:50.870
PETER FETTERMAN: What are
they now, all diesel trains?

00:30:50.870 --> 00:30:52.370
STEVE MCCURRY:
They're all, I guess,

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:53.720
diesel or electric or whatever.

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:57.570
And that particular
track has been ripped up.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:30:58.400
And it's gone.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:04.130
So although the railroad
yard still exists there

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:08.000
and there are trains that
go back and forth many times

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.900
a day, that particular
track is gone.

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:15.880
And the steam engines are gone.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:20.870
But this juxtaposition between
the Taj Mahal and the train,

00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:23.100
I thought, was great.

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:27.470
I spent some time with Paul
Theroux, the great travel

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:28.660
writer--

00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:31.460
just a great writer in general.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:37.010
And we did this journey
from the Khyber Pass

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:39.980
through Pakistan, India,
and into Bangladesh.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.560
PETER FETTERMAN: Did he
suggest images along the way

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.530
as you were chatting?

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:46.010
Or through your
conversations, did that

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:48.651
spark a direction to go in?

00:31:48.651 --> 00:31:50.150
STEVE MCCURRY: I
never need a writer

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:52.114
to suggest images for me.

00:31:52.114 --> 00:31:53.780
PETER FETTERMAN:
You're self-generating.

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.370
STEVE MCCURRY:
But I have to say,

00:31:55.370 --> 00:32:00.290
I was inspired to do this
story based on his book,

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:02.690
"The Great Railway
Bazaar," which

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:08.120
I had read when I was
in bed with dysentery,

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:09.940
getting rabies shots
at the same time.

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.230
I was delirious.

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:17.990
But that book was so delightful
and such a great read.

00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:22.790
And then five years later,
meeting him and then recreating

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:24.530
this particular
leg of the journey,

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:26.030
I thought, was great fun.

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:29.090
PETER FETTERMAN: Which
movies have inspired you?

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:36.140
STEVE MCCURRY: Well, I
think "Sunset Boulevard."

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.150
I'd see that over
and over again.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:40.850
And it was filmed right
here in Los Angeles.

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:46.760
But all the work of Kubrick--

00:32:46.760 --> 00:33:01.160
of course, I always loved
Charlie Chaplin's movies,

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.027
"Goodfellas."

00:33:04.027 --> 00:33:06.110
PETER FETTERMAN: Little
bit of violence thrown in.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.943
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:17.692
I take all of my own movies
on the plane on my iPad.

00:33:17.692 --> 00:33:19.400
PETER FETTERMAN: So
that's how you relax.

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.800
STEVE MCCURRY: That's
how I relax, absolutely.

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.740
Yeah.

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.170
PETER FETTERMAN: And other
great books you've read that--

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.530
STEVE MCCURRY:
The Coen brothers,

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:29.740
they had the "O Caesar" that
just came out and "O Brother."

00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:36.620
I read a book recently by
Fawn Brodie on the life

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:40.490
and times of Sir Richard
Francis Burton, who

00:33:40.490 --> 00:33:45.890
was a 19th century
British explorer who

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:49.640
spoke 25 languages.

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.504
PETER FETTERMAN: Do you identify
with that kind of travel lust?

00:33:52.504 --> 00:33:53.420
STEVE MCCURRY: No, no.

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:57.540
He lived in another time and
did it in a much more grand way.

00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:02.750
But he lived in India.

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:05.735
He lived in Syria,
South America.

00:34:05.735 --> 00:34:08.300
He traveled to the US.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.790
He spoke all these
languages flawlessly--

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:14.969
Arabic, Hindi, plus all
the European languages.

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:24.449
Tried to find the
source of the Nile--

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:28.810
so he had an incredible-- that
kind of adventure now no longer

00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:33.440
exists, because I think
now we get upset--

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.320
he was actually
walking from Zanzibar

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.469
close to Lake Victoria.

00:34:39.469 --> 00:34:42.139
PETER FETTERMAN: What do you
think drove him on to do that

00:34:42.139 --> 00:34:43.865
against all those odds?

00:34:43.865 --> 00:34:45.365
STEVE MCCURRY: I
think he was crazy.

00:34:47.855 --> 00:34:49.230
PETER FETTERMAN:
You think you're

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:52.820
a bit crazy to put yourself
in these situations?

00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.179
STEVE MCCURRY: You think,
I'm still a young man.

00:34:55.179 --> 00:35:02.420
But why would you go to
crawl through the muck now

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:03.507
when I don't have to?

00:35:03.507 --> 00:35:05.090
PETER FETTERMAN: So
what's the answer?

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:07.190
STEVE MCCURRY: I could
go live on a beach and--

00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:08.390
PETER FETTERMAN: You're
a very successful guy.

00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.810
You could--

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:10.050
STEVE MCCURRY:
--smoke a good cigar.

00:35:10.050 --> 00:35:12.591
PETER FETTERMAN: --as we were
talking in the car coming over,

00:35:12.591 --> 00:35:14.240
you could retire.

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:15.690
What keeps you driving?

00:35:15.690 --> 00:35:16.850
What is it?

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:20.360
STEVE MCCURRY: I think it's
simply loving what you do.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.450
I get great pleasure
and great fulfillment

00:35:23.450 --> 00:35:26.930
out of making pictures.

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:30.770
The whole process of
walking down the street

00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:35.210
and discovering things
is a great pleasure.

00:35:35.210 --> 00:35:41.960
And I think that I can
never imagine just retiring

00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.360
and to do what?

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.830
Retire from what you love?

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:49.472
Can you imagine
Picasso saying, I

00:35:49.472 --> 00:35:50.930
think I've painted
enough pictures,

00:35:50.930 --> 00:35:53.990
I'm going to just go relax now?

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:57.950
I think this is
what energizes me

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:01.640
and what gives great
purpose to my life.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:07.160
And I'm still excited
about going to new places

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.250
and going back to old places.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:12.110
I've been to Italy.

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:14.120
I'm going back to
Italy in about a week.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.620
PETER FETTERMAN: Do you think
you're getting better at this?

00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:23.024
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah, I think
you have to believe that.

00:36:23.024 --> 00:36:25.190
PETER FETTERMAN: Otherwise
you can't get out of bed.

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.940
STEVE MCCURRY: No.

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:30.870
But I think that as you
perfect your craft--

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:34.385
how you see light.

00:36:34.385 --> 00:36:38.930
I've photographed
for 40-plus years.

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:42.380
And I've photographed--
not everything,

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:44.750
but I kind of feel like I've
photographed everything.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:50.330
And I think you want to
photograph things in new ways.

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:56.060
And I think then you're
starting to do better work,

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:58.550
because you've run
through all the cliches.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:03.270
Now you're trying to
maybe up your game a bit.

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:07.130
So I think I'm doing as
good of work or better.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:11.285
I think digital
photography actually--

00:37:11.285 --> 00:37:12.660
PETER FETTERMAN:
Makes it easier?

00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.900
STEVE MCCURRY: --make
a big improvement,

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:20.720
because I've always
gravitated towards low light,

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.610
dark corners.

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:28.880
And with digital, you can
really work in that low light,

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:33.860
whereas with film
it was impossible.

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.377
So often, I remember you're
in a really dark situation,

00:37:37.377 --> 00:37:38.210
and you're shooting.

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:39.834
You think, oh, this
is a great picture.

00:37:39.834 --> 00:37:40.850
I'm really happy.

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:42.857
You get home a
month later and you

00:37:42.857 --> 00:37:46.370
realize all the pictures
are back-focused.

00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:47.630
You thought you were in focus.

00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:50.430
But in fact, you
missed the focus.

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:55.310
But with digital, at some
point, you can check.

00:37:55.310 --> 00:38:01.000
Because if it's dark, you can
check and say, oh, my god,

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.074
I'm not in focus.

00:38:02.074 --> 00:38:03.740
PETER FETTERMAN: Are
there any drawbacks

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:04.698
to shooting in digital?

00:38:04.698 --> 00:38:07.317
Is there anything you miss
about the analog life you had?

00:38:07.317 --> 00:38:08.150
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:13.370
I think the only tricky part
is the storage and having

00:38:13.370 --> 00:38:15.200
to have multiple backups.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:19.220
Because you put your
pictures on a hard drive,

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:21.870
it goes in a drawer.

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:26.180
You come back to it
5, 10, 15 years later,

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.730
and maybe the hard
drive is degraded.

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:32.192
Maybe something happened to it.

00:38:32.192 --> 00:38:33.650
Maybe you can't
read it any longer,

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:35.275
because you don't
have the right cords.

00:38:35.275 --> 00:38:38.270
There's all sorts of things.

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:43.670
So you have to be really careful
that your work is backed up.

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:50.600
And we have a great system
in multiple locations

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:52.346
just for that very reason.

00:38:52.346 --> 00:38:53.970
PETER FETTERMAN: As
a man of the world,

00:38:53.970 --> 00:38:58.351
what's your biggest fear
for the future of humanity?

00:38:58.351 --> 00:39:00.350
STEVE MCCURRY: I think
we're on the right track.

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:02.870
I'm just not sure we're going
to get there soon enough.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:13.660
Let's ask that question of
the elephants and the tigers.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:16.550
What do they think about the
state of the world right now?

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:18.260
I think they would
be like, oh, my god,

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:20.210
the world's coming to an end.

00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:27.020
So we know that in the case
of wildlife, they're in peril,

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:29.600
and it's a dire situation.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:32.420
And I think more
people care today

00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:35.905
about that or climate change
or the oceans or whatever.

00:39:35.905 --> 00:39:37.280
Just a question
of-- are we going

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:43.160
to move fast enough to
actually make a difference

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:47.250
or to save the planet?

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:50.630
We all hope so, but I
think it's not a done deal.

00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:52.070
PETER FETTERMAN:
Well, we're being

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:54.350
hosted by one of the
great technology companies

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:55.490
in the world.

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:57.500
If you can have one
wish, what would you

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:01.100
wish that a company
like this could do now

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.390
of all that you've seen?

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:05.780
STEVE MCCURRY: I think the
more people are connected

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:11.270
and the more they have access
to information and education,

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:13.840
health care, I think
that this will be a far--

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:17.480
when people have
that information,

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.650
their lives will be better.

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:23.600
And I think people will
tend to come together,

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:27.700
hopefully, and respect
each other's cultures.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:28.742
I think that's important.

00:40:28.742 --> 00:40:30.158
PETER FETTERMAN:
So we're hopeful,

00:40:30.158 --> 00:40:32.030
even though we turn
on the television

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:33.830
and we look at
what's going on now?

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:36.519
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah, there's
a lot of reason to be--

00:40:36.519 --> 00:40:37.560
PETER FETTERMAN: Despair.

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:38.393
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah.

00:40:38.393 --> 00:40:42.270
But I think we've
got to power through.

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:43.500
There's no option.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.832
We have to move forward.

00:40:44.832 --> 00:40:47.040
PETER FETTERMAN: Well, you've
given us a lot of hope,

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:50.520
and your images connect us.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.846
Maybe it's a good time
to ask some questions.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.304
STEVE MCCURRY: Everybody
has to ask one question.

00:40:59.304 --> 00:41:00.720
We're going to go
around the room.

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.136
PETER FETTERMAN: Absolutely.

00:41:08.179 --> 00:41:09.470
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:11.450
I really admire your work a lot.

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:13.760
And I'm just so
grateful you're here.

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:18.500
So I had a question-- one
related to shooting style

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.870
or your approach to shooting.

00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:26.010
So I know with
Bresson, I think what

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:29.340
he would do is he would
set his focus in advance

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:30.095
and his exposure.

00:41:30.095 --> 00:41:32.095
And he'd walk around,
without even looking

00:41:32.095 --> 00:41:33.470
through the
viewfinder sometimes,

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:35.630
and just wait for
everything to come together,

00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:39.920
and then shoot at
the decisive moment.

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:45.050
For shots that you take that
look unplanned or unposed,

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:46.647
how many of those
are you shooting

00:41:46.647 --> 00:41:48.230
without looking
through the viewfinder

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:52.760
and just waiting for a moment
or it just comes up to you?

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:55.205
Like the people
coming up to the cab,

00:41:55.205 --> 00:41:57.080
it looked like maybe
you weren't even looking

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:57.830
through the viewfinder.

00:41:57.830 --> 00:41:59.538
You just had the camera
here and shot it.

00:41:59.538 --> 00:42:01.624
Or were you looking
through the viewfinder?

00:42:01.624 --> 00:42:04.040
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah, I always
look through the viewfinder.

00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:08.420
He had an uncanny ability
to make really good pictures

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.950
holding his camera up.

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:14.960
But the advantage we have
now over photographing

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:20.300
in the '40s or the '50s is
that we have auto-focus now.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:24.230
We can work at a
much higher ISO.

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:29.180
Where he may have
been at 200 or 100,

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:32.300
I can shoot it at
1,000 or 2,000.

00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:39.420
So we can get much
sharper pictures.

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:47.740
But I think that I don't
do so well when I don't

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:49.787
look through the viewfinder.

00:42:49.787 --> 00:42:50.870
I need to see the picture.

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:53.286
AUDIENCE: And have you ever
written about your experiences

00:42:53.286 --> 00:42:55.760
in India when you were there
those first couple years?

00:42:58.602 --> 00:43:00.560
STEVE MCCURRY: There may
be something in this--

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.685
PETER FETTERMAN: There's
a lot of great information

00:43:02.685 --> 00:43:06.400
about Steve's process in
this wonderful book called--

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:07.400
STEVE MCCURRY: "Untold."

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.880
PETER FETTERMAN: --"Untold."

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:11.750
Should we hold it up?

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:12.710
I will hold it.

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:15.080
Thank you so much
for loaning it.

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.900
I think this is a great
insight into what it takes

00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:19.319
to be a great photographer.

00:43:19.319 --> 00:43:21.110
And I think this is
probably the first time

00:43:21.110 --> 00:43:23.420
you articulated
many of the things

00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:25.100
that you said today in print.

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.700
So if you want to
know more of what

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.590
it takes to be a
great photographer,

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:35.020
I would recommend this book,
"Untold," Steve McCurry.

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:38.380
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:39.799
PETER FETTERMAN: Thank you.

00:43:39.799 --> 00:43:41.590
AUDIENCE: There was a
story a few years ago

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:43.330
where a team from
National Geographic

00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:46.030
went back to
Afghanistan or Pakistan

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:48.500
to find the girl in the photo.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.250
And I believe they
found her in a village.

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:51.374
Were you part of that team?

00:43:51.374 --> 00:43:53.250
And did you talk with her?

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:55.625
Or what was your experience
going back to her

00:43:55.625 --> 00:43:58.757
or see her 20 years
later or whatever it was?

00:43:58.757 --> 00:43:59.590
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah.

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:02.890
I was part of that documentary.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:06.040
We had gotten thousands
of letters over the years.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.560
People wanting to know--

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:12.020
where is she, how can we
help her, is she still alive?

00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:14.170
They wanted to send her money.

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:17.020
Men wanted to marry her.

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:19.370
It was incredible.

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:23.620
So just after 9/11,
when people started

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:28.450
to learn about
Afghanistan, we decided

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:31.870
to go and try and find her.

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:34.960
And we had no idea
where she was.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:36.910
We didn't know her name.

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:40.540
So I thought, well, let's
go back to the refugee camp

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:42.790
where I had photographed her.

00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:46.390
And I just knew there
was no way we were ever

00:44:46.390 --> 00:44:48.400
going to locate her.

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.820
But we got very lucky.

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:55.360
And after a few days,
we found the teacher

00:44:55.360 --> 00:44:57.910
who had been in the
classroom that day.

00:44:57.910 --> 00:45:02.890
And then another week went by.

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:06.895
Somebody came up and said, I
know where her brother lives.

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:13.810
And then we thought, well, it
could be they're wanting money.

00:45:13.810 --> 00:45:17.140
I thought, OK, that's
just the story.

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:20.950
But lo and behold, he
actually found the brother.

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:23.890
And of course, once we found the
brother, we were able to find--

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:26.390
PETER FETTERMAN: How long did
it take you to find her again?

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:27.850
STEVE MCCURRY: About two weeks.

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:28.420
PETER FETTERMAN:
And there were times

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:29.544
when you wanted to give up.

00:45:29.544 --> 00:45:32.440
You thought, this is
futile, what am I doing?

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:37.240
STEVE MCCURRY: There
were so many people

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:41.030
who were pretending
to be her and saying,

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:42.152
oh, it's great to see you.

00:45:42.152 --> 00:45:43.610
PETER FETTERMAN:
Like fake Elvis's.

00:45:43.610 --> 00:45:46.410
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah.

00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:51.020
And they would swear up and
down that they were the girl

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.450
and they remembered everything.

00:45:52.450 --> 00:45:57.830
And there was one who
everybody was convinced--

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:01.829
even the filmmaker,
he got on the phone

00:46:01.829 --> 00:46:03.370
and was calling all
these eye doctors

00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:06.040
around the world
saying, is it possible

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:09.027
that her eyes could
go from the way they

00:46:09.027 --> 00:46:10.235
were in the picture to brown?

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:16.945
He's waking up doctors in
the middle of the night.

00:46:16.945 --> 00:46:18.820
One of the doctors said,
well, it's possible,

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.884
there could be a shift.

00:46:21.884 --> 00:46:23.550
And they took that
and just ran with it.

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:24.466
They thought for sure.

00:46:24.466 --> 00:46:27.310
So we went down
the road really far

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:30.860
with her, in terms of
interviewing her and all that.

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:35.131
PETER FETTERMAN: It must
have been pretty emotional

00:46:35.131 --> 00:46:36.670
for both of you.

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:38.680
STEVE MCCURRY: Well,
when we actually

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:42.190
met her and she walked
through the door,

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:43.960
I was literally expecting--

00:46:46.510 --> 00:46:49.390
half thinking that it was going
to be the same little girl

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:50.432
walking through the door.

00:46:50.432 --> 00:46:51.848
PETER FETTERMAN:
Time had stopped.

00:46:51.848 --> 00:46:52.840
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah.

00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:54.790
And this is 17 years later.

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:56.445
Now she's a grown woman.

00:46:56.445 --> 00:46:57.070
She's a mother.

00:46:57.070 --> 00:46:58.090
She's married.

00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:01.870
And she was dressed in black.

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:04.210
It was a rather dark room.

00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:06.610
And this figure walked in.

00:47:06.610 --> 00:47:09.300
And I thought, whoa, I
wasn't expecting that.

00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:12.490
But she was healthy.

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:14.240
And as I said, she had a family.

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:19.030
And we quickly,
within the same day,

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:22.790
we started talking about,
how can we help you?

00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:26.650
What can we do to
make your life better?

00:47:26.650 --> 00:47:32.470
But in that culture,
to be able to meet her,

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:36.920
photograph her is a complete
impossibility, because women

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:40.357
are not supposed to
be seen by somebody

00:47:40.357 --> 00:47:41.440
outside of their families.

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.981
PETER FETTERMAN: So how did you
negotiate your way around it?

00:47:43.981 --> 00:47:46.270
STEVE MCCURRY: Well, we
had a great translator

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:50.050
who happened to be a very
respected journalist.

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:51.760
We had his help.

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:55.300
Her husband-- we had to get the
permission from the husband--

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:59.290
agreed to let us meet her.

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:01.870
And I think they trusted us.

00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:04.180
I think they felt
that this was going

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:07.280
to be a good thing for them.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:13.930
And I was able to photograph
her, which never happens.

00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:17.871
So it was a great story to--

00:48:17.871 --> 00:48:19.870
PETER FETTERMAN: And was
she aware of the impact

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:22.510
that the original photo
had had on the world?

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:25.870
STEVE MCCURRY: Well,
she is illiterate.

00:48:25.870 --> 00:48:28.080
So she wasn't aware.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.550
She didn't get
magazines or newspapers

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:37.500
and had no idea that her
picture was famous and published

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:38.820
all over the world.

00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:42.030
And she didn't know that.

00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:45.999
She thought that, well,
there's that one copy.

00:48:45.999 --> 00:48:47.040
But then we explained it.

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.230
And then when the
documentary came out,

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:53.820
we made sure she had access to
a television so she could see,

00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:56.520
because the story ran
all over the world.

00:48:56.520 --> 00:49:00.960
And so since then,
we've been continuing

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:04.260
to be in touch with her and
help her in all possible ways.

00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:12.600
AUDIENCE: I have a question more
about your current projects.

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.580
I know there's a lot of
tumultuous situations

00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:19.120
around the world-- the Syrian
refugee crisis, for example.

00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:21.250
What are you
currently working on?

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:23.050
Are you involved in that at all?

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:26.830
I'm just more interested in
what you're currently doing.

00:49:26.830 --> 00:49:29.380
STEVE MCCURRY: Well,
my work has really

00:49:29.380 --> 00:49:33.880
shifted away from magazines.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:37.350
And I'm doing more
personal projects.

00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:39.250
At this point in my
life, I want to do

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:43.360
exactly what I want to do.

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:46.664
I want to have fun and do things
that I think are interesting.

00:49:46.664 --> 00:49:49.080
PETER FETTERMAN: Come here and
talk and explain your work.

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:49.395
STEVE MCCURRY: Exactly.

00:49:49.395 --> 00:49:50.380
Yeah.

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:57.340
So I think it's important
to evolve and grow and do

00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:58.810
different things in your life.

00:49:58.810 --> 00:50:02.280
So now I'm interested
in books, exhibitions,

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.620
like with Peter in the gallery.

00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:08.020
And I want to go places.

00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:15.199
And I have a book coming
out in a few weeks on people

00:50:15.199 --> 00:50:16.240
reading around the world.

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.190
It's a interesting little book.

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:20.770
I just have a book on
India that came out.

00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:27.100
And I want to have other
projects I want to do.

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:31.540
And I just want to go to
places and be involved

00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:36.160
with situations
and my nonprofit,

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.230
helping children in Afghanistan.

00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:41.035
So this is how I want to spend--

00:50:41.035 --> 00:50:43.840
I want to just do
exactly what I think

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:47.469
is the most important
thing for me right now.

00:50:47.469 --> 00:50:48.510
AUDIENCE: You deserve it.

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:50.869
STEVE MCCURRY: Thank you.

00:50:50.869 --> 00:50:53.160
PETER FETTERMAN: If there
was one word to describe you,

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:54.701
or somebody else
describing you, what

00:50:54.701 --> 00:50:57.700
would that word be,
apart from crazy?

00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:01.400
STEVE MCCURRY:
Energetic, passionate.

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:02.008
Yes, ma'am.

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.070
AUDIENCE: So I love your work.

00:51:07.070 --> 00:51:13.040
And as an Indian who spent
all of six years in India,

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:17.030
I live vicariously
through your pictures.

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:20.900
And so I had a question.

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:23.840
I go back to that part of
the world every few years.

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.690
And it changes
every time I'm back.

00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:28.940
And you mentioned
something about the fact

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:31.850
that you photographed something,
then you come back to it,

00:51:31.850 --> 00:51:32.560
and it changes.

00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:40.500
Have you ever felt in going back
that it's changed in some way?

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:42.890
And what are your
thoughts on how

00:51:42.890 --> 00:51:45.360
it's changed and transformed
through the years?

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:46.630
STEVE MCCURRY: Right.

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:53.550
By the way, my book on India
is purely my point of view.

00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:57.980
And in my book, I'm
not really trying

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:02.190
to tell the story of India.

00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:06.930
It's more like a diary,
my personal impressions.

00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:13.790
India's a vast country
with so much going on.

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:17.300
My book is more just
personal impressions,

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.980
little moments in time.

00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:21.330
And it's nothing more than that.

00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:24.650
I'm not trying to
say, this is India.

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:27.900
That's impossible
to do in one book.

00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:35.730
But India, when I first arrived
in '78, there was no internet.

00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:39.110
Making phone calls--
there was no cell phones.

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:44.450
To book a call back home would
take sometimes hours and hours.

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:46.880
Sometimes it never went through.

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.650
I shipped film back by the post.

00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:54.500
Now you can send
them wirelessly.

00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:57.590
Or there was FedEx for a while.

00:52:57.590 --> 00:52:59.900
But there was a time when
I would send my film,

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:04.480
literally mail it back.

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:12.410
But with all the internet
and whatnot, people in India

00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:16.430
now have access to
all the information.

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:18.500
I used to walk
through a village,

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:21.530
and children used to follow me,
because I was like a novelty--

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:24.230
had a camera and
was this foreigner.

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:27.770
And now children,
they've seen it all.

00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:33.920
And they're not fascinated
with a foreigner with a camera,

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:38.870
because they've seen better
on their video games.

00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:46.330
So back when I first went to
India, the cars on the street,

00:53:46.330 --> 00:53:49.400
there were two or three,
mostly made in India.

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:50.570
Now they have all the cars--

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:51.630
Mercedes.

00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:52.685
You can get everything.

00:53:52.685 --> 00:53:55.007
PETER FETTERMAN: Could you
still take this photo today?

00:53:55.007 --> 00:53:56.590
STEVE MCCURRY: This
one from Calcutta?

00:53:56.590 --> 00:53:58.339
PETER FETTERMAN: Has
it changed that much?

00:53:58.339 --> 00:54:02.390
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah,
that's still pretty much

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:03.570
the way it is.

00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:05.990
I love Calcutta.

00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:08.940
If somebody said,
here's a blank check,

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:12.320
go to a city in the world and
do a book or an exhibition,

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:13.420
I'd go to Calcutta.

00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:14.461
PETER FETTERMAN: Because?

00:54:14.461 --> 00:54:16.010
STEVE MCCURRY: It's so rich.

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:17.480
First of all, there's great art.

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:22.970
And the arts in West Bengal
and Calcutta are very rich.

00:54:22.970 --> 00:54:25.940
Filmmaking, photography--
they have great festivals

00:54:25.940 --> 00:54:28.630
there, great spirit.

00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:32.180
And there's this vibrancy on
the street which is unmatched,

00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:35.570
I think, any place in the world.

00:54:35.570 --> 00:54:39.260
So I'm a big fan of Calcutta.

00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:41.630
And yeah, this
was a street scene

00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:44.810
there that it was
just incredible.

00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:50.840
Back when I first
went there, there

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:54.890
was a limited amount of
access to certain products.

00:54:54.890 --> 00:54:57.020
So now everything is available.

00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:59.930
And all the tech
companies are there.

00:54:59.930 --> 00:55:02.270
The automobile
companies are there.

00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:07.160
And they're really
taking over the world.

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:08.910
PETER FETTERMAN: We
have another question.

00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:14.850
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for being here.

00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:17.700
So having the opportunity
to travel the world,

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:20.270
you've seen multiple
humanitarian issues.

00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:23.600
And I appreciate you
sharing them with the world

00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:26.450
and being able to have that
action impact that way.

00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:29.570
But I'm just wondering, what
causes and humanitarian issues

00:55:29.570 --> 00:55:33.980
do you take away as being
most important to you

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:36.080
that you're actively
focusing on?

00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:38.300
I know that you mentioned
having a nonprofit.

00:55:38.300 --> 00:55:42.040
Can you tell me a little bit
more about those efforts there?

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.540
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah.

00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:49.310
In the past, we've sent
textbooks to Bamyan Province

00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:53.690
and supported
teachers and whatnot.

00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:56.300
Now we've shifted.

00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:59.570
My sister is very
active in this.

00:55:59.570 --> 00:56:05.630
We're actually organizing
cameras and photography classes

00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:08.690
for young Afghan girls--

00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:13.080
give them a chance to have
a different experience,

00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:16.400
have a creative outlet,
photograph their friends,

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:19.310
family, their community,
and to just have

00:56:19.310 --> 00:56:23.010
this artistic endeavor.

00:56:23.010 --> 00:56:25.880
So that's where
we're at with that.

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:32.840
And we're in Bamyan Province,
in Kabul, and in Herat.

00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:34.340
And some of the
pictures are really

00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:38.460
wonderful that these
young girls are making.

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:39.584
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:56:39.584 --> 00:56:40.625
STEVE MCCURRY: Thank you.

00:56:43.810 --> 00:56:45.820
PETER FETTERMAN:
Any more questions?

00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:46.800
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:49.280
I guess a related follow-up
question would be,

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:52.040
have you ever found yourself
in certain situations

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:53.780
where there was a
humanitarian crisis

00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:56.120
and it was really difficult
for you personally

00:56:56.120 --> 00:57:00.380
to keep your journalistic
distance from the subject?

00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:02.630
I'm sure you've been
approached a lot--

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:04.130
with the woman in that photo--

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:05.040
to ask for money.

00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:09.010
And how do you negotiate
those conversations?

00:57:09.010 --> 00:57:13.190
And I was just wondering if
you could speak more to that.

00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:14.940
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah.

00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:20.510
When I was in
Cambodia, when there

00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:22.430
were hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians

00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:26.120
flooding into Thailand,
things were a bit tense.

00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:33.230
And they would come up to us
or to me and say, can you help?

00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:36.530
One guy came up to me and
said, I have some gold,

00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:39.250
can you take it
back into Thailand

00:57:39.250 --> 00:57:42.620
and exchange it for money?

00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:45.530
And they were really desperate.

00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:48.180
And you do the best you can.

00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:51.060
I took the gold, and I
changed it and all that.

00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:53.690
But you try and help
in any way you can.

00:57:53.690 --> 00:57:59.150
But I would say that in
my experience, by the time

00:57:59.150 --> 00:58:06.380
I get to these places,
the Red Cross and UNHCR

00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:10.670
and a lot of the relief
agencies are already there.

00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:14.180
And everything's
pretty much set up.

00:58:14.180 --> 00:58:19.680
So in my experience,
by the time I show up,

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:23.030
everything's pretty
much already organized.

00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:27.025
But still you can
help in small ways.

00:58:27.025 --> 00:58:28.400
PETER FETTERMAN:
Well, thank you.

00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:30.899
Thank you, Google, for all
your-- oh, you have a question.

00:58:30.899 --> 00:58:32.190
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:35.330
And you started your talk
about-- you mentioned

00:58:35.330 --> 00:58:38.550
some fine lines when
you take a picture

00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:41.660
or sometimes you decide
not to take it, step away.

00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:44.190
You decide to publish
it or not to publish,

00:58:44.190 --> 00:58:47.360
to post-process and how
much to post-process.

00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:50.090
In your 40-plus
years experience,

00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:52.570
do those lines change?

00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:56.030
Do you regret today not
taking certain pictures

00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:59.210
or the opposite-- maybe you
published certain pictures that

00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:01.250
you today wouldn't?

00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:04.370
How much would you
change if anything?

00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:06.620
And maybe a related
question is, do you

00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:09.600
have any unpublished
pictures and why?

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.059
Why wouldn't you
publish if you do?

00:59:12.059 --> 00:59:13.850
STEVE MCCURRY: I have
hundreds of thousands

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:15.710
of unpublished pictures.

00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:19.730
I would be delighted to
publish those pictures.

00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:22.230
Some pictures are
better than others.

00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.730
No.

00:59:22.730 --> 00:59:28.130
I think that we all have
unpublished pictures.

00:59:28.130 --> 00:59:32.960
And maybe some
unpublished pictures

00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:37.970
are better unseen,
because you want pictures

00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:39.125
to come up to a certain--

00:59:39.125 --> 00:59:41.000
PETER FETTERMAN: Do you
think you're the best

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.706
judge of what is your--

00:59:42.706 --> 00:59:44.510
STEVE MCCURRY: No.

00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:48.500
I know you mentioned the picture
by Andre Cartier-Bresson which

00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:51.620
had gone unnoticed largely.

00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:58.024
And you saw it, liked it, and
asked to have a print made.

00:59:58.024 --> 00:59:59.690
And it's a wonderful,
beautiful picture.

00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:00.690
I think it's incredible.

01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:03.110
It's in your gallery.

01:00:03.110 --> 01:00:11.690
So I think that
there's a reason why.

01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:15.110
I think you want your
best work published.

01:00:15.110 --> 01:00:18.980
And I can't think
of a situation where

01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:21.500
I took pictures
which I regretted

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.860
or got published and regretted.

01:00:24.860 --> 01:00:26.690
I can't really think of many.

01:00:26.690 --> 01:00:32.610
There is one instance that comes
to mind where in Bangladesh--

01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:36.230
I think it was during
the War of Independence--

01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:40.040
there were some
photographers who were there.

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:44.420
And there were these
soldiers that were maybe

01:00:44.420 --> 01:00:47.810
encouraged by the press.

01:00:47.810 --> 01:00:49.430
And there's this
famous picture--

01:00:49.430 --> 01:00:53.930
won a Pulitzer Prize-- which
the soldiers bayoneting

01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:56.950
this poor person,
probably to death.

01:00:56.950 --> 01:01:01.130
And maybe if the press
had walked away, maybe

01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:06.097
that person wouldn't have--
but in the heat of the moment,

01:01:06.097 --> 01:01:06.680
things happen.

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:10.820
This is a long
time-- generally, I

01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:16.910
would say most of my colleagues,
they are compassionate people

01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:18.770
and want to do the right thing.

01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:24.950
So there's always something
that goes sideways.

01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:28.140
But I think in general things
either do the right thing.

01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:32.016
So I don't have any situations
like that that I regret taking.

01:01:32.016 --> 01:01:33.890
PETER FETTERMAN: Well,
hopefully, maybe we'll

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:35.480
get invited back
by Google and we

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:38.210
can have Steve McCurry,
the unseen photos.

01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:41.362
And you'll be the first people
in the world to see them.

01:01:41.362 --> 01:01:42.570
But thank you all for coming.

01:01:42.570 --> 01:01:45.172
Thank you, Benjamin,
for hosting this.

01:01:45.172 --> 01:01:46.148
Thank you, Steve.

01:01:46.148 --> 01:01:48.100
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:50.642 --> 01:01:52.350
STEVE MCCURRY: Yeah,
thank you very much.

01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:53.808
It was a great
pleasure to be here.

01:01:53.808 --> 01:01:55.420
Thank you.
