00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.070
Let's say I go to the fruit
store today and they

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.720
have a sale on guavas.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.730
Everything is 30% off.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:08.550
This is for guavas.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.370
And it's only today.

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.750
Only today.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.550
So I say, you know what, let
me go buy a bunch of guavas.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.850
So I go and I buy 6 guavas.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.380
So I buy six guavas.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.360
And it ends up, when I go to
the register, and we're

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.480
assuming no tax, it's a grocery
and I live in a state where

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.900
they don't tax groceries.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.680
So for the 6 guavas, they
charge me, I get the 30% off.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.510
They charge me $12.60.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.660
$12.60.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.270
So this is the 30% off
sale price on 6 guavas.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.293
I go home, and then my wife
tells me, you know, Sal, can

00:00:51.293 --> 00:00:54.050
you go get 2 more
guavas tomorrow?

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.710
I say, sure.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.770
So the next day I go and I
want to buy 2 more guavas.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.030
So, 2 guavas.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.760
But now the sale is off.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.060
There's no more 30%.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.580
That was only that first
day that I bought the 6.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.640
So how much are those two
guavas going to cost me?

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.660
How much are those two guavas
going to cost at full price?

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.800
At full price?

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.530
So, a good place to start
is, to think about how much

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.230
would those 6 guavas have
cost us at full price?

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:26.610
This is the sale
price, right here?

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.190
This is the sale price.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.500
How much would those have
cost me at full price?

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.350
So let's do a little
bit of algebra here.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.580
Pick a suitable color
for the algebra.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.790
Maybe this grey color.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.165
So, let's say that x is equal
to the cost of 6 guarvas.

00:01:47.165 --> 00:01:53.630
6 guavas, at full price.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.100
So, essentially, if we
take 30% off of this,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.950
we should get $12.60.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.050
So let's do that.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.235
So if we have the full price
of 6 guavas, we're going

00:02:02.235 --> 00:02:04.190
to take 30% off of that.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.290
So that's the same
thing as 0.30.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.680
Or I could just write 0.3.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.740
I could ignore that
zero if I like.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.640
Actually, let me
write it like this.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.470
My wife is always bugging me to
write zeroes before decimals.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.670
So that's the full price of
6 guavas minus 0.30 times

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.960
the full price of guavas.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.350
Some I'm just taking 30%
off of the full price,

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.520
off of the full price.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.900
This is how we figure
out the sale price.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.480
This is going to be equal to
that $12.60 right there.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.540
That's going to be
equal to $12.60.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.900
I just took 30% off
of the full price.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.200
And now we just do algebra.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.140
We could imagine there's a
1 in front -- you know, x

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.020
is the same thing as 1x.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.285
So 1x minus 0.3x is going
to be equal to 0.7x.

00:02:50.285 --> 00:02:54.240
So we get 0.7x, or we could
say 0.70 if you like.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.170
Same number.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.070
Point, or 0.7x, is
equal to 12.60.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.130
And once you get used to these
problems, you might just skip

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.780
straight to this
step right here.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.670
Where you say, 70% of the
full price is equal to

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:08.550
my sale price, right?

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.000
I took 30% off.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.150
This is 70% of the full price.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.360
You might just skip to this
step once you get used to these

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.270
problems in a little bit.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.780
And now we just have
to solve for x.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.040
Divide both sides by 0.7,
so you get x is equal to

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.370
12.60 divided by 0.7.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.970
We could use a calculator, but
it's always good to get a

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.060
little bit of practice
dividing decimals.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.860
So let's do that.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.590
So we get 0.7 goes into 12.60.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.880
Let's multiply both of these
numbers by 10, which is what we

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.270
do when we move both of their
decimals one to the right.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.580
So the 0.7 becomes a 7.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.040
Ignore that right there.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.980
The 12.60 becomes 126, put
the decimal right there.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.340
Decimal right there.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.680
And we're ready to just do
straight up long division.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.120
So this is now a 7, not a .7.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.210
So 7 goes into 12 1 time.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.930
1 times 7 is 7.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.630
12 minus 7 is 5.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.870
Bring down the 6.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.340
7 goes into 56 8 times.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.380
8 times 7 is 56.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.410
And then we have no remainder.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.820
So it's 18, and there's nothing
behind the decimal point.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.890
So it;s 18, in our case, $18.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.800
So x is equal to $18.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.750
Remember what x was? x was
the full price of 6 guavas.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.920
x was the full price of 6.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.070
x is the full price
of 6 guavas.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.670
Now, the question is, how
much will 2 guavas cost

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:46.220
me at the full price?

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.710
Well, this is full price of 6.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.340
So you immediately could
figure out what's the

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.530
full price of one guava.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.640
You divide 18 by 6.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.770
So 18 divided by 6 is $3.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:09.470
That's $3 per guava
at full price.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.870
And they're asking us,
we want 2 guavas.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.280
So 2 guavas is going to
be 2 times $3, so this

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.740
is going to be $6.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.550
$6.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.050
Another way you could have done
it, you could have just said,

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.000
hey, 6 at full price are
going to cost me $18.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.640
2 is 1/3 of 6.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.440
So 1/3 of $18 is $6.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.130
So, just to give a quick
review what we did.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.760
We said the sale price
on six guavas, $12.60.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.360
That's 30% off the full price.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.290
Or you could say this is
70% of the full price.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.760
70% of the full price.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.510
And so you could say, 30% -- so
if you say x is the full price

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.580
of 6 guavas, you could say the
full price of 6 guavas minus

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.790
30% of the full price of 6
guavas is equal to 12.60, and

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:02.140
that's equivalent to saying,
70% of the full price is 12.60.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.340
You divided -- then we just
solved this algebraically.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.150
Divide both sides by 0.7, and
then we got x, the full price

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:14.820
of 6 guavas, is $18, or that's
$3 per guava or $6 for 2.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.370
Anyway, hopefully you
found that helpful.
