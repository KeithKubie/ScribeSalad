COLBY HYLAND:
Dance, to me, really

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.900
is kind of the ultimate
expression of myself.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.720
I think from when I
started at eight years old

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.340
until now, dance has
been one of the most

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.130
constant aspects of my life.


00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.770 position:97%
 


00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.020
I'm Colby Hyland.


00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.090
I'm a junior here at Princeton.


00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.020
I'm majoring in
molecular biology,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.780
and I'm pursuing a
certificate in dance.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:44.740 position:97%
 


00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.210
I try to dance almost every day,
whether that's in the Princeton

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.900
program in dance,
whether that's kind

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.830
of just going to a
studio with my friends

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.540
and hang out, or actually
working with choreographers

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.020
that Princeton brings
to campus and getting

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.970
real works set on us.


00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:10.450 position:97%
 


00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.370
ORI FLOMIN: Colby is a
teacher's dream, really.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.400
He's hardworking, he
takes corrections well,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.790
he's always prompt and
on time and responsible.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.390
One thing I told
all the students,

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.540
I said, you need to be
responsible with your role,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.600
so when I come
back to the studio,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.280
you remember what
we did last week.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.550
It's not like we start
everything from beginning,

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.260
so we can push forward.


00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.760
And I want to see,
when I'm coming,

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.050
I want to see you've practiced.


00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.760
I want to see that
you know the material.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.970
And he really took all that
in and has been working hard

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.370
and, yeah, he looks great.


00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:51.380 position:97%
 


00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.920
COLBY HYLAND: With
molecular biology,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.680
there is a lot with
patterning and signaling

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.740
and kind of how molecules
are all working together.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.050
I think in that way,
there can be a lot related

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.900
to dance in terms
of cooperativity

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.070
and how bodies move in space.


00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:10.610
So maybe there's
not a direct link

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.650
as so much like art
and molecular biology.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.320
But I think the
fundamental concepts

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.550
of maybe movement and
patterns and things

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.010
like that could definitely
be explored with dance.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:35.490 position:97%
 


00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.680
Something that I've really
loved about Princeton

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.680
is just that I can explore
so many different styles.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.650
It seems like every semester
you're kind of challenged

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.150
with something
completely different.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.880
I mean, even if it's
contemporary dance,

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.190
there's just such a
wide array of actually

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.520
what contemporary dance is.


00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.140 position:97%
 


00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.840
How is my personality changing?


00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.900
How are my
relationships changing?

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.350
How is everything
that I'm experiencing

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.620
in the world changing?


00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.000
And to explore that
in this art form,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.270
and to really find whether
it's emotional or mental or

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.100
physical, to really
explore that through dance,

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.150
throughout my lifetime,
has been really the best

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.980
expression of myself,
and has really shown me

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.750
and taught me so much that
I'm really thankful for.
