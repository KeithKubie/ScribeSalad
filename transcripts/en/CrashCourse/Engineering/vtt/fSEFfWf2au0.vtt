00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:08.600
Whether you’re putting food into your body
or fuel into your car, you’re always trying to get
something out of raw materials.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.320
You’re trying to convert energy.

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.740
But if you want to understand how this works,
we need to talk about thermodynamics, and the
laws behind it.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.540
Only then can we truly harness the power of
energy as engineers.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:29.560
[Theme Music]

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.600
Energy is constantly being converted all around
you.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.600
When you take a bite of an apple, you
take in the fruit’s energy and convert it into
something that your body can use.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.550
Maybe you’ll use it to help power the marathon
you’re training for.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.220
Maybe it’ll go to power your normal bodily
functions.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.300
Or you might store the energy to use later,
as fat.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.660
But energy conversions don’t just happen
on a personal scale.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.059
They’re also at the core of many engineering
designs, like with hydroelectric dams.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:03.440
In a hydroelectric dam, water turns a turbine, which then
turns a metal shaft in an electric generator, converting
the movement of the water into electricity.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.340
These conversions are important, because
energy doesn’t just come out of nowhere.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.820
It needs to come from some other type of energy.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.840
So, to better understand how energy can be
converted, you need to understand thermodynamics.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:22.400
Thermodynamics is the branch of physics and
engineering that focuses on converting energy,
often in the form of heat and work.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.100
It describes how thermal energy is converted to
and from other forms of energy and also to work.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.900
And thermodynamics is one of the main focuses
of mechanical engineering.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.440
Because thermo, as it’s often called, is
critical to engines.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.980
Engineers need to know how much heat or work
they’ll get out of an engine if they put energy into it.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.600
We’ll talk a lot more about engines in the
next episode.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:50.520
Even when we’re not focused on heating or cooling
something, like with heat pumps and refrigerators,
we still don’t want our machines overheating.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.160
After all, engineering is not just about getting more of
what we want, but also controlling what we don’t want.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.520
It’s not just mechanical engineers that
deal with thermodynamics.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.160
It also plays a big role in chemical engineering.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.509
When chemical reactions form new compounds,
they often create energy.

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.679
And often that energy is thermal energy.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.680
Now, to understand how all this works, we
should start at the bottom: the zeroth law
of thermodynamics!

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.660
Yes, that’s really what it’s called!

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.840
We only came to understand the zeroth law after its
more famous siblings – the first and second laws –
had already been established.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.660
But it was considered so fundamental to
thermodynamics that it was promoted to be
more than first – so, “zeroth”!

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.420
Now, this law focuses on temperature and defines
thermal equilibrium.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.700
In general, an equilibrium is where certain
properties, like pressure, volume, or temperature,
remain the same across the system.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.980
So, if two or more things are in thermal equilibrium,
then they’re all at the same temperature.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.860
The zeroth law says that when two objects are
individually in thermal equilibrium with a third object,
then they are also in equilibrium with each other.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:59.540
This is important because when a body is left in a
medium at a different temperature, energy will be
transferred until a thermal equilibrium is established.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.800
That’s why, if you leave a cold soda out
in the sun, it will warm up and reach the
same temperature as the air outside.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:11.720
The basic ideas behind why this happens lie
within the next law, the first law of thermodynamics.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.940
The first law of thermodynamics applies the law
of conservation that we learned a few episodes
ago to thermodynamics.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.220
It basically defines heat as a form of energy,
which means it can neither be created nor
destroyed.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.180
So we can’t create or destroy energy, but
we can convert it from one form to another.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.500
This might seem pretty simple, but it’s
a powerful idea.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:38.200
It allows us to better understand a system, how
we can get energy from it, or how we can stop the
conversion of energy when we want to.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.400
Now, no matter what system you’re looking at,
there are two areas of energy that we need to
concern ourselves with:

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.260
the energy contained within the system, and the
energy that can move between boundaries.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.540
Let’s start with the energy inside a system.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.840
We can break it down into three main parts.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.420
The first is kinetic energy. This is the type
of energy that’s involved with movement.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.780
The most common form is translational kinetic
energy, which is when something moves from
one location to another.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:11.860
There’s also rotational kinetic energy, when
something spins or rotates, and vibrational kinetic
energy, when something shakes or vibrates.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.200
Think about it in terms of throwing a baseball.

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.950
As it flies through the air, the ball will
have kinetic energy.

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.320
The kinetic energy would be translational
as it moves from your hand to your friend’s
mitt, and rotational as it spins in the air.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.080
The second type of energy inside a system
is potential energy.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.580
This is energy that can come from where something
is, even if it’s not moving.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.260
We can basically think of it as stored energy.

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.500
Potential energy often has to do with how
high something is.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.580
The higher it is, the more potential energy
we can have.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.340
This is often called gravitational potential
energy.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.160
Like, if you’re climbing a ladder, you’ll have more
and more potential energy with every step you take.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.740
But potential energy can also come from an
object's horizontal position.

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.500
Think about a bow and arrow.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.660
Using elasticity, we can transfer potential
energy to an arrow as we draw it back in a bow.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.300
As we fire the arrow, the potential energy
will be transformed into kinetic energy.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.460
But the third type of energy that we’ll
find in a system is a bit different.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.420
It’s called internal energy.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.100
Internal energy is the energy associated with
the seemingly random movement of molecules.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.180
It’s similar to kinetic or potential energy,
but on a much smaller, microscopic scale.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.120
Take a glass of water for example.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.520
As it just sits there on a table, the water
doesn’t seem to be moving.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.100
But on a microscopic level, the water is 
teeming with molecules that are traveling
around at super high speeds.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:33.240
While this type of energy might not seem as
important, it can have major effects on a system.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:41.640
That’s because changes in internal energy can result
in changes in temperature, changes in phase – like a
solid to a gas – or changes in chemical structure.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.700
All of these types of energy – kinetic,
potential, and internal – show us what can
exist within a system.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.380
But these types of energy can’t cross the
boundary from their system to the surroundings.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.000
But we’ve already talked about the main
types of energy that can cross boundaries.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.180
One is heat, which we know to be the flow of
thermal energy, and another other is work, which
is essentially any type of energy other than heat.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:07.300
So knowing all of these different types of energy
involved with a system can help us understand the
first law of thermodynamics.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:11.600
Let’s start with a closed system, where
no fluid is moving in or out.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.539
A good example would be a piston enclosed
in its cylinder.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:20.760
The first law of thermodynamics states that
the change in internal energy, kinetic energy,
and potential energy of a system

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.800
is equal to the heat added to the system,
minus the work done by the system.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.720
This equation may look pretty complicated,
but there are a few different scenarios that
can help clear it up.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.620
One is a stationary system.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:40.200
If you look at the left side of the equation, you’ll
see that the changes in kinetic and potential
energies will be 0 for a system that isn’t moving.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.940
Another special case is an adiabatic process.

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.020
An adiabatic process is when there is no heat
transfer.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.360
It’s rooted in the Greek word “adiabatos”,
meaning “not to be passed”.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:58.200
This can happen if there are no differing temperatures,
or if something is so well insulated that only a negligible
amount of heat can pass through the boundary.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.420
Think of it like how a good thermos bottle
can keep your hot chocolate warm.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.120
Now you can also simplify this equation if
you have an isochoric process.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.600
When a process is isochoric, the volume of
the system remains constant.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.840
This often means that there won’t be any
work, leaving us with only heat on the right
side of the equation.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:21.600
Any of these special cases help give you a
much simpler equation to work with, but this
all has to do with a closed system.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.620
Oftentimes you’ll find yourself dealing
with more complex, open systems.

00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:29.919
Unlike closed systems, open systems have a
flow going in and out.

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:34.439
A good example would be if your basement flooded
and you wanted to pump the water out of it.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.760
With a system like this, you’ll need to
introduce a different energy measurement:
enthalpy.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:44.600
Enthalpy includes internal energy, but also
adds in the energy required to give a system
its volume and pressure.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.020
For an open system, you’ll also want to
refine what you mean by work.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:55.160
Here you’ll want to focus on shaft work,
which is basically any type of mechanical energy
other than what’s necessary for flow.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:03.540
Going back to our equation, you’ll want to replace
your internal energy with enthalpy and change your more
general work to focus specifically on shaft work.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.620
This will let you apply the law to open systems
as well.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.400
So let’s use a flooded basement as our open
system.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:16.760
First off, we should establish that we’ll be treating
the basement as our system and the outside, where
we want the water to go, as our surroundings.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:23.020
When we run the pump, it will take in electricity
and convert it to shaft work, which turns the pump.

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:29.260
That energy will then be used to get the water
moving, which will change some of its potential
energy to kinetic energy.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.600
Hydroelectric dams are open systems too.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.660
If you think of the dam as a system and its
environment as its surroundings,

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:41.800
then you see that there’s flow coming in, in the form
of water, and flow coming out in the form of electricity.

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.700
It’s a little more complex than just draining
a basement,

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:51.420
and it’ll take a lot longer to learn everything
that’s involved with generating electricity, but
the laws behind it are exactly the same.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.490
So you see, you can’t always find the exact
answers to problems quickly.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:09:00.300
But through science and engineering, you’ll
have the tools and knowledge to solve them
the best you can.

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.400
So today we learned about thermodynamics and
how it shows up in our lives.

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.860
We started by learning the zeroth law of
thermodynamics and what it means to reach
|a thermal equilibrium.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:15.560
Then we talked about the different types of
energies involved with a system and defined
the first law of thermodynamics.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:22.380
We also found out that stationary, adiabatic,
and isochoric processes can make our lives
as engineers a little easier.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:27.800
I’ll see you next time, when we’ll learn
about entropy and move on to the second law
of thermodynamics.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.000
