00:00:00.987 --> 00:00:05.968
You might have heard the term LIBOR when people are quoting interest rates.

00:00:05.968 --> 00:00:11.076
Or they're saying "Hey I'm gonna lend you money a few percentage points above LIBOR"

00:00:11.076 --> 00:00:14.267
You will hear...LIBOR quoted on some of the financial news channels.

00:00:14.267 --> 00:00:21.533
And what it is, is just an average of the interest rates that banks are lending to each other.

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:27.533
And it is calculated by the British Bank Association.

00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:30.350
It's actually calcuated by Thomson Reuters for the British Bank Association.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.944
But it's there to kind of provide a benchmark for other types of securities and financial transactions.

00:00:35.944 --> 00:00:40.267
And it literally stands for the London Interbank Offered Rate.

00:00:40.267 --> 00:00:45.733
So...it's the..... in London...it's the rate..the offered rate between banks.

00:00:45.733 --> 00:00:48.667
The London Interbank Offered Rate.

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:52.667
To understand that a little bit better we have set up two banks over here

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:56.359
Bank A and Bank B. And you might have already known that

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.095
when you go and deposit your money in banks,

00:00:59.095 --> 00:01:01.791
the bank won't leave all that money around.

00:01:01.791 --> 00:01:08.267
The way it makes money is lend a good bit of money to other people as loans.

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:10.283
And it keeps just enough cash on hand

00:01:10.283 --> 00:01:14.467
That things well you know, people would actually come and ask for money from their checking account.

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:15.933
We have enough on hand

00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:19.636
You could imagine....every now and then that bank might get low on cash.

00:01:19.636 --> 00:01:22.875
or it might get close to kind of a reserve requirement

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:26.867
that the central bank in that country requires a bank to have on it.

00:01:26.867 --> 00:01:32.231
So in those situations ...say bank A is getting to that...that situation.

00:01:32.231 --> 00:01:34.200
They said "let me go borrow some money"

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.067
Let me go borrow money from another bank.

00:01:37.067 --> 00:01:39.056
So this is interbank borrowing.

00:01:39.056 --> 00:01:41.000
Bank B over here they are flushed with cash

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.067
So they say we don't like to keep so much cash around.

00:01:43.067 --> 00:01:46.754
We want to lend it. So we can actually get interest. We get no interest on cash

00:01:46.754 --> 00:01:49.933
So maybe bank B lends money to Bank A

00:01:49.933 --> 00:01:53.067
So maybe they lend this much cash

00:01:53.067 --> 00:01:55.548
So that's the new cash that bank A got.

00:01:55.548 --> 00:01:58.338
Right over there ...the new cash

00:01:58.338 --> 00:02:01.671
And of course it is a loan

00:02:01.671 --> 00:02:05.079
So this is a new loan. To offset it, remember

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.570
assets are equal to liabilities plus equity.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.985
So liabilities is this whole thing over here.

00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:15.187
So this is loan from B for this cash.

00:02:15.187 --> 00:02:18.530
They have a little bit better of a cushion.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.035
And now B, their loan has increased and their cash has decreased.

00:02:23.035 --> 00:02:26.053
So this is a loan, loan to A.

00:02:26.153 --> 00:02:29.444
Right now, they took this cash and they gave to bank A

00:02:29.444 --> 00:02:32.694
And that rate that they lent it at,

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:36.038
maybe it was that 1% annual rate.

00:02:36.038 --> 00:02:41.656
And of course it is to be renewed everyday, it is overnight rate.

00:02:41.656 --> 00:02:44.119
This rate is an interbank rate.

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:48.856
So what they do is on behalf of the British Bank Association

00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:51.456
They go survey a bunch of banks in London

00:02:51.456 --> 00:02:54.333
eight, twelve, sixteen banks in London.

00:02:54.333 --> 00:02:57.122
So they said "Hey what was the rate in which you all transacted"

00:02:57.122 --> 00:03:00.373
and they will quote that

00:03:00.373 --> 00:03:03.205
They quote that as the overnight LIBOR

00:03:03.205 --> 00:03:08.830
So they quoted it, say hey 1.2% across all of the banks that we surveyed

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.726
But what's interesting about the LIBOR, it is done in ten currencies

00:03:12.726 --> 00:03:14.723
It is not just in the sterling, the dollar

00:03:14.723 --> 00:03:18.733
or the yen...It is in ten currencies

00:03:18.733 --> 00:03:21.642
That's what really differentiate it amongst other things

00:03:21.642 --> 00:03:28.605
But really differentiate it from the effective Federal Funds Rate which is another interbank borrowing rate

00:03:28.605 --> 00:03:30.867
But that's in the United States

00:03:30.867 --> 00:03:34.390
And that's more revolving around policy concerns.

00:03:34.390 --> 99:59:59.999
The Federal Bank actually tries to change it.
