Speaker 1:          00:00          One of the striking features of human female reproduction is menstruation. It's uncomfortable. It's sometimes painful. Why did it evolve? There are four hypotheses. One is that the evolve to eliminate parasites introduced with copulation evolve to save energy.

Speaker 2:          00:23          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:24          Or it may have evolved to protect the uterus from inflammation or is a byproduct of maternal fetal conflict.

Speaker 2:          00:33          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:33          Here are those major hypotheses sketched out on a bit more detail and I'd like to make a few comments about them.

Speaker 1:          00:40          The first one is the menstruation evolved to get rid of pathogens that were brought in with a sperm and so the claim is that is protecting the uterus against colonization by pathogens. The problem is that menstruation occurs weeks after copulation and this problem of having sperm borne pathogens is not unique to species. That ministry, there are many species that don't menstruate that would have the same problem. The second idea is that menstruating conserves energy and the administration and resorption is energetically less costly than maintaining a differentiated endometrium. However, maintaining a differentiated differentiated endometrium is not the alternative and other species. It also would not allow for Avi Elation or sperm transport or sperm capacitation.

Speaker 1:          01:35          So a third hypothesis is that menstruation is actually not adaptive. It is a consequence of spontaneous decidual lization. So the real issue then becomes spontaneous decision realization and we'll go into that in a minute to explain exactly what that is. Now that is consistent with known con known consequences if does of decidual lization and uh, in the paper we're allying all on this is the argument that the authors were making. So the problem then is to explain why decidual ization became spontaneous. A fourth possibility is that the uterus is being preconditioned by menstruation and that is protecting uterine tissues from hyper inflammation and from oxidative stress that are associated with deep placentation in humans with the deep, deep invasiveness of plantation.

Speaker 2:          02:31          Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:31          So this claim ignores why ministration may have evolved in ancestral primate species and administrating non primates that don't have the deep invasion.

Speaker 2:          02:42          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:42          And it may ignore the benefits that spontaneous decision realization might provide. So what we're going to do is we're going to really focus on spontaneous decidual ization

Speaker 2:          02:54          okay.

Speaker 1:          02:54          First a bit of a refresher on the human menstrual cycle. It has a follicular phase and the luteal in the ovary. During the follicular phase, the follicles mature. During the luteal phase, the Corpus luteum is secreting progesterone. What that does in the uterus is that in the proliferative phase, the superficial endometrium is shed and flip operation begins. Then in the luteal phase, that's the secretory phase where the endometrium continues to deliver to differentiate and proliferate. The hormone levels in the follicular phase are dominated by estrodial all and in the luteal phase by progesterone, menstruation starts on day one. So that's the follicular phase. [inaudible] occurs on day 14. And then decision realization begins. So decidual ization is the transformation of the endometrium stimulated by progesterone under maternal control to prepare it to receive the implanting embryo when for gesture or own is withdrawn. The differentiated endometrial stromal cells undergo apoptosis and that leads to menstruation. We know that ministration evolved three times. It's indicated here in red,

Speaker 2:          04:23          and

Speaker 1:          04:24          that includes the primates over here, some bats, and interestingly the elephant shrews. So other things that ministry include chimpanzees and givens and uh, orangutans and mechanics and some of the monkeys, as well as several bats. And the elephant. Shrew. What features do these organisms share? They all have spontaneous decision realization. They have invasive Hema Correale presentation. They have extended meeting periods. They have spontaneous ovulation. That means Oblation, which is not induced by meeting itself.

Speaker 2:          05:16          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:16          And they have one or two well-developed offspring per pregnancy. So they have a few, we'll develop relatively large offspring per pregnancy. So the three groups in which menstruation occurs, all have hemo Correale Placentas, menstruation is here in red. So here is, uh, the elephant shrew. You are humans and here are the free tail vats. Okay. So they all have hemo Correale placentas, highly invasive placentas.

Speaker 2:          05:50          Okay.

Speaker 1:          05:51          The real issue appears to be spontaneous decision realization. So in mammals that don't menstruate, decidual [inaudible] occurs when the embryo implants in mammals that men's straight decidual lization is spontaneous. That means that it's under maternal control and it occurs independently of the presence of an embryo. So why did it evolve?

Speaker 2:          06:14          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:14          Well, one hypothesis is that it's a maternal response that protects the mother from the invasive embryo. Another hypothesis is that it's a mechanism that allows the mother to discard defective embryos. These are not mutually exclusive. So if you have spontaneous decision realization administration, it is one way of flushing a defective embryo out of the female reproductive tract.

Speaker 2:          06:41          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:41          We know that there are other features of quality control built into the female reproductive tract. There is a treasure and they're spontaneous abortions.

Speaker 2:          06:52          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          06:54          Oh, city Katriza starts about the third month of pregnancy. At that point, there are about 7 million oh sites in the newly formed ovaries by birth. There are about a million by men are about a thousand. And by menopause they're nearly none left. So a Trecia does seem to target both nuclear and mitochondrial mutations and it appears that there's at least a tendency for the damaged eggs to be eliminated and the less damaged eggs to be kept.

Speaker 2:          07:25          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:25          Spontaneous abortions or miscarriages are relatively frequent estimates of the proportion of pregnancies that ended in early unrecognized abortion range from 30 to 75% clinically recognized pregnancies, character, uh, miscarry, and about 10 to 20% of cases, most of which have chromosomal abnormalities. About 70% of gestations diagnosed with ultrasound is twins are singletons when they are delivered. So in all of these cases, there is some kind of selections it's going on in the reproductive tract. Prior to birth, spontaneous abortion may function to both eliminate defective embryos and to reduce the reproductive cost of twins. So to summarize, ministration evolved at least three times in mammals, always in lineages that have invasive placentation, it appears to be a byproduct of adaptations to protect the mother in fetal maternal conflict. It may also have evolved as a quality control mechanism, and the key mechanism is decidual lization that is spontaneous rather than triggered by meeting.
