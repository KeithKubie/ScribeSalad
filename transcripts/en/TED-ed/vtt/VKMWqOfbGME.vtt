00:00:07.989 --> 00:00:10.718
On the night of January 1, 1801,

00:00:10.718 --> 00:00:13.949
Giuseppe Piazzi, 
a priest in Palermo, Italy,

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:16.649
was mapping the stars in the sky.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:19.919
Over three nights, he'd look at and draw
the same set of stars,

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.000
carefully measuring 
their relative positions.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.378
That night, he measured the stars.

00:00:25.378 --> 00:00:27.569
The next night, he measured them again.

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.679
To his surprise, one had moved.

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.800
The third night, the peculiar star
had moved again.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.101
This meant it couldn't be a star at all.

00:00:36.101 --> 00:00:39.892
It was something new, the first asteroid
ever discovered,

00:00:39.892 --> 00:00:43.380
which Piazzi eventually named Ceres.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.865
Asteroids are bits of rock and metal
that orbit the Sun.

00:00:46.865 --> 00:00:52.014
At over 900 kilometers across,
Ceres is a very large asteroid.

00:00:52.014 --> 00:00:53.888
But through a telescope, like Piazzi's,

00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:58.151
Ceres looked like a pinpoint of light
similar to a star.

00:00:58.151 --> 00:01:01.122
In fact, the word asteroid 
means star-like.

00:01:01.122 --> 00:01:03.101
You can tell the difference between stars

00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:06.041
and asteroids by 
the way they move across the sky.

00:01:06.041 --> 00:01:09.212
Of course, Piazzi knew 
none of that at the time,

00:01:09.212 --> 00:01:11.752
just that he had discovered something new.

00:01:11.752 --> 00:01:13.072
To learn about Ceres,

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:15.733
Piazzi needed to track 
its motion across the sky

00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:19.182
and then calculate 
its orbit around the Sun.

00:01:19.182 --> 00:01:23.833
So each clear night, Piazzi
trained his telescope to the heavens.

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:26.303
Night after night, 
he made careful measurements

00:01:26.303 --> 00:01:28.323
until finally, he couldn't.

00:01:28.323 --> 00:01:30.182
The Sun got in the way.

00:01:30.182 --> 00:01:35.087
When Piazzi first spotted Ceres,
it was here, and the Earth was here.

00:01:35.087 --> 00:01:39.373
As he tracked it each night,
the Earth and Ceres moved like this

00:01:39.373 --> 00:01:41.634
until Ceres was here.

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:46.454
And that meant that Ceres was only
in the sky when it was daytime on Earth.

00:01:46.454 --> 00:01:51.424
During the day, bright sunlight made 
this small asteroid impossible to see.

00:01:51.424 --> 00:01:55.069
Astronomers needed to calculate
Ceres's orbit.

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.554
This would let them predict where
it was going to be

00:01:57.554 --> 00:02:00.821
in the vast night sky on any given night.

00:02:00.821 --> 00:02:04.733
But the calculations were grueling
and the results imprecise.

00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:07.015
Many astronomers searched for Ceres,

00:02:07.015 --> 00:02:10.716
but not knowing exactly where to look,
no one could find it.

00:02:10.716 --> 00:02:14.937
Luckily, a hardworking mathematician
named Carl Friedrich Gauss

00:02:14.937 --> 00:02:17.444
heard about the lost asteroid.

00:02:17.444 --> 00:02:20.706
He thought it was an exciting puzzle
and went to work.

00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:23.935
When he realized he didn't have
the mathematical methods he needed,

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:27.754
he invented new ones 
that we still use today.

00:02:27.754 --> 00:02:32.586
He derived a new orbit and new predictions
of where to look for Ceres.

00:02:32.586 --> 00:02:36.077
Hungarian astronomer
Baron Franz Xaver von Zach

00:02:36.077 --> 00:02:39.167
searched for Ceres 
with Gauss's predictions.

00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:41.424
After weeks of frustrating clouds,

00:02:41.424 --> 00:02:46.776
von Zach finally had clear skies
on December 31, 1801.

00:02:46.776 --> 00:02:50.396
He looked through his telescope
and finally saw Ceres.

00:02:50.396 --> 00:02:53.116
We haven't lost track of it since.

00:02:53.116 --> 00:02:57.517
Today, we've discovered hundreds
of thousands of asteroids.

00:02:57.517 --> 00:03:01.707
Many, including Ceres, orbit the Sun
between Mars and Jupiter,

00:03:01.707 --> 00:03:06.136
while near-Earth asteroids orbit
the Sun relatively close to Earth.

00:03:06.136 --> 00:03:08.058
When we recorded this narration,

00:03:08.058 --> 00:03:13.538
astronomers had discovered 
16,407 near-Earth asteroids,

00:03:13.538 --> 00:03:15.766
but since we find 
new asteroids all the time,

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:18.589
that number will have grown
by hundreds or thousands

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:21.699
by the time you watch this.

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:24.408
Today, asteroid hunters 
use modern telescopes,

00:03:24.408 --> 00:03:26.780
including one in space.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.532
Computers analyze the images,

00:03:28.532 --> 00:03:30.039
and humans check the output

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:34.099
before reporting the asteroid observations
to an archiving center.

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:37.869
Each discovered asteroid has its unique
orbit measured.

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:41.661
An orbit lets astronomers predict 
where asteroids are going to be

00:03:41.661 --> 00:03:44.061
at any given time.

00:03:44.061 --> 00:03:47.667
Most asteroid trajectories can be
predicted for about 80 years

00:03:47.667 --> 00:03:51.640
though we can calculate where the best
studied asteroids will be every day

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.560
between now and 
800 years into the future.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.449
We must keep searching for asteroids

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:01.399
in case there's one out there
on a collision course with Earth.

00:04:01.399 --> 00:04:04.300
Astronomers don't only 
search for asteroids, though.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.619
They also study them 
to learn how they formed,

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:07.900
what they're made of,

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.950
and what they can tell us 
about our solar system.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.861
Today, we can do something that Piazzi
could only dream of:

00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:18.551
send spacecraft to study 
asteroids up close.

00:04:18.551 --> 00:04:21.560
One spacecraft called Dawn
journeyed billions of kilometers

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.141
over four years to the main asteroid belt.

00:04:25.141 --> 00:04:29.431
There, it visited Ceres
and another asteroid, Vesta.

00:04:29.431 --> 00:04:33.191
Dawn's stunning images transformed
Piazzi's dot of light

00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:36.191
into a spectacular landscape
of craters,

00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:37.200
landslides,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.510
and mountains.
