MATT JONES: I'm Matt
here in Google Chicago.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.855
And Lyft has offered to
pick up one of our speakers

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:10.730
for our dev meetup.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.220
MARCUS WEEMES: This is
Marcus with Lyft here.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.678
I've got Patrick,
and we're getting

00:00:13.678 --> 00:00:16.149
ready to take him over to the
Code the Road, Google meetup.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.990
So what are you looking
forward to the most?

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.330
PATRICK SKOGLUND: Sitting
down with other developers

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.890
and figure out what
aspects they like, things

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.770
that they're architecting.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.490
It's good to get
behind the scenes.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.450
I work for a company
called SADA Systems,

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.154
and we use Google Maps
APIs every single day.

00:00:30.154 --> 00:00:31.570
There's a lot of
individual things

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.194
that you can do with
Google Maps API.

00:00:33.194 --> 00:00:34.360
So we use Lyft, for example.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.010
I wanted to request a Lyft.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.870
And Lyft has to figure
out a way to identify

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.300
what cars are near you, right?

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.346
So you use Distance
Matrix API to do

00:00:45.346 --> 00:00:47.345
a calculation in accordance
to the road network.

00:00:47.345 --> 00:00:48.970
So you're not just
figuring out, here's

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.110
a Lyft car that's two miles
away from me, pure distance.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.360
It's, here's a Lyft car
that's two miles away from me,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.762
in relation to the road network.

00:00:56.762 --> 00:00:57.970
And that's how it calculates.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.410
But when you look
at Google Maps,

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.570
you're able to so many things.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.000
So from a user
experience standpoint,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.570
it's really changed the way that
people interact with things.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.920
