00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.820
My name is Tamara Chambers

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.500
and I'm about to watch Return to Oz for the first time ever

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.880
It's gonna be some much fun

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.840
Tamara's Never Seen!

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.020
*disturbed silence*

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.520
*drop*

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.360
It's like this horrifying combination of like Twilight Zone and The Waltons

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.460
First of all the show Dorothy, who is apparently aging in reverse because she looks like she's seven years old

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.060
...She has incredible hair though

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:42.020
So "Dorothy" finds a key on her farm in Kansas that says "Oz" and she looks at it for...a hundred years

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.220
Then, she takes the key and runs to Aunt Em, because of course, Aunt Em already thinks she's crazy

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:55.000
So,  Aunt Em takes her to a doctor, who is going to use electrical currents to cure her of her "Belief in Oz"

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.540
Which is actually pretty progressive for the time. So...Way to go, Aunt Em.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.680
There's a doctor and a nurse, Mrs. Wilson, who's super horrifying and, like, real fierce.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.780
And then it just magically turns into a horror film, right in front of your eyes.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.220
Return to Oz, a story about Dorothy Gale in Kansas, turns into a *horror film*

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.060
So Dorothy's in a Psych Ward (basically) strapped down to this chair, about to get electrocuted for believing in Oz

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.300
And...And...There's this terrifying nurse (In this amazing black dress)

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:35.920
and this doctor, and they're about to electrocute her, and then a lighting storm happens and the whole place goes black.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:45.300
So the nurse and the doctor leave Dorothy to go take care of some other patients who are moaning...scarily...and creepily...

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.760
(It's not good)

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.480
So then they escape through this dark forest while Mrs. Wilson is chasing them

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.440
(In her *amazing* dress, like, it's amazing, it's a really good dress)

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:03.660
And they fall into a river and all of a sudden out of nowhere there's, like, a floating piece of wood

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.440
Like out of nowhere, like, in the Titanic

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.580
Just chillin' there...just...

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.600
And then it turns into like a crib that's floating which... it turns into like a chicken coop I guess, but it looks like a crib

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.740
And it's floating, in the middle of a river, and then that river turns into, like, the fuckin' ocean

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.900
So they're just out in the middle of nowhere in the ocean in a crib that's floating

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:32.760
Then! Dorothy wakes up and there's a talking chicken...in the crib, which, it's a chicken coop, duh, Tamara, duh! Of course! Of course it is!

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.440
The ocean is dried up, and it's just a pond

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.360
And they're in Oz

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.960
Bum Bum Buuuum!

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.260
The chicken is named "Billina" which is her chicken from the farm...Kansas...

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.560
But honestly, she's super funny

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:59.260
...she's the best part of the movie, I really think, 10/10 would recommend watching Billina again she's *way* better than all of the other famous chickens

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.620
*Regretful mumbling*

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.660
So they go across the little chunk of the evil...desert.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.520
and you find that the bad guys are rocks

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.720
(Which is...it's actually pretty scary)

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.080
Then they get to Emerald City, or, what is left of Emerald City

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.320
And...

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.900
These...things show up, the Wielders

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.320
*Unintelligible* What the f*ck? *giggling* What the f*ck!?

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.060
They're like loud flamboyant Slendermans on rollerskates...it's, it's amazing

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.560
It's *so* scary!

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.020
'Cause first of all, they're got these helmets with, like, the-the faces on 'em and you're like

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.640
"What the f*ck is that?"

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.680
"Is that Clay-mation?"

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:45.940
And then they...put their faces up and it...they're humans, but they're on roller skates and they look like Slenderman but very, very flambouyant and gaitly

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.620
*mouthing* I love them

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.829
So...after a while, the Wheelers revealed that the Gnome King is
the evil big bad guy and that he doesn't

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.819
allow chickens...chickens aren't allowed in OZ

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:08.450
(What? What?) so then Dorothy, Billina (the best chicken
in the world) and their new friend

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.510
Tick-Tock go to Princess Mombi's house
to retrieve the Scarecrow who is now the

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.440
leader of the Emerald City (that's now
destroyed) and honestly the best part of

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.479
that scene is when Billina sees the house
for the first time and goes "Wow"

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.139
"This Princess Mombi is some house
cleaner" it's like, girl, you live in a

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.580
chicken coop, with poop...way to stay
humble, though, then princess mombi locks

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.690
Dorothy up, in the tower, in the hopes that
in a couple years her head will ripen

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.180
for her head collection, so that she can
shop with his head off and use it...for

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.570
herself because she's a headless.
horrifying. creature.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:53.230
*laughing* but this is for kids... so in the tower Dorothy
meets jack which is like a pumpkin, like Jack

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:58.150
Skellington but it's like, more cartoony
than the actual cartoon of Jack Skellington

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:09.220
(He's clay-mation, that's why) um...she meets Jack and Jack keeps calling her
mom, which is weird...He should stop Dorothy, Jack, and

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.540
most wonderful chicken in the world make
the plan to escape by creating this

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:21.460
character made out of a Gump which is
like...like a deer, and they put his head on top

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:27.160
of a sofa... with some plants to flap away...It's,
it doesn't hold up with science, it's not

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.410
scientific...at all

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.540
I will not give them that, but they need this
powder from the princess and so she

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.950
goes and steal the powder and then all of
her heads catch her, and so all of her heads are

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.530
screaming and then the headless Princess
Mombi is chasing them and it's SO F*CKING

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.400
SCARY

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.550
it's like horrific like it's like "horror
film" scary and it's for kids which...

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.200
is awesome, I love it... I can't imagine
watching this as a child...I can't imagine...

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.970
my mom didn't let me watch Rugrats growing up, like, this would have scared the *shit* out of me!

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.370
Anyways they get the powder, and they're
sprinkling it on this Gump character and

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.380
she flies away as the headless Mombi's
chasing them, so they're escaping through

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.910
the air on this nightmare machine of
this like Gump head and a sofa and some

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:20.090
plants and meanwhile he's like "What am I?"
as he's flapping through

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.470
the air and they're like "You're a thing, you're just,  you're a thing." literally what she says

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:30.680
she's like "Well, you're a...thing" also,

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.040
Jack keeps calling Dorothy his mother and
I know that Jack is a newborn

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:39.169
pumpkin...man, but it seems like he's a
full-grown pumpkin man because he's man

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:41.720
shaped...and it's *creepy*

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.050
so as they're flying through the air, the
Wheelers coming looking for them again

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.580
and on second inspection,

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:51.410
I love the Wheelers, they are super cool
and I want to try on their skates, then

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:56.360
Dorothy all of them crash and the Gump disassembles is everywhere and

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.150
they're on *Gnome Mountain*

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.900
so this is the first time you see the
Gnome King and he sounds like Mufasa and

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:09.200
Kylo Ren put together and he looks like
an evil clump of play-doh (and it's awesome)

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:14.930
so the Gnome King transfers them down to
his underground secret rock layer where

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:19.070
he reveals that he has the ruby slippers
in *the best way* it's like this

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:26.180
incredible reveal, like "They're very powerful" so
the Gnome King makes them play this game...

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:31.729
where they have to guess which
knickknacks are their friends? Which is  pretty

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:38.539
messed up and of-f*cking-course on the
last try, Dorothy gets it then, you see

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:39.960
the Scarecrow and he is

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.819
horrifying-looking...time has not been good
to him, like, I know it's only been six

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:52.229
months but like...maybe he has a drinking
problem (and he should stop it) then, as they're trying to escape

00:07:52.229 --> 00:07:57.900
all of the evil Play-doh rocks attack them
and right as evil Gnome King is about to

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:02.880
eat Jack, the pretend Jack Skellington
character, one of Linda's eggs pops

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:08.880
into his mouth and *destroys everything*!
done! And he, like melts, like the witch

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:14.009
like evil witch like in Wizard of Oz (I just got that...) That's all it took!

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:19.349
one egg! *snapping* Girl works good under pressure
so Dorothy has the slipper back and everything

00:08:19.349 --> 00:08:24.660
is restored and she sees the Scarecrow
in The Lion the Tin Man and they all

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:26.669
look bad and weird and I love it

00:08:26.669 --> 00:08:31.289
so Dorothy leaves Oz with the promise
from the queen of Oz that she can return

00:08:31.289 --> 00:08:37.110
"Anytime she likes" and she leaves her
chicken friend! Which is a bitch move,

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:41.130
honestly then she's like magically back
on the riverside in Kansas where she

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:45.540
like fell overboard at the hospital and
Toto finds her, like a champion

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:48.420
and that's right when I realized that
Toto had not been in the movie at all

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:53.100
like he didn't go back to Oz like "Bark bark
f*ck that shit bark, bye have fun"

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:59.100
"I don't like lions so...peace!" then you see that
Mrs. Wilson was always Princess Mombi

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:05.430
Mome-bee? Moby Dick? ???? and she's arrested and
ends up in a cage just like princess

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:06.390
Mombi did...

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:11.010
Whooooo...and it's just all so f*cked up

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:18.960
like it's so weird and cool and
horrifying and creepy and like, you can

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:24.330
tell a lot of money was put into it but
it also looks real janky in the best way

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:30.930
like, it stuck to the weird themes of the
old movie but did justice to the books

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.580
more so because of the ultra weirdness
that are brought into it and it was so...

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:39.060
uncomfortable...

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:45.810
to watch... like...why was this made? And how did they cast this girl?

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:50.580
it was a weird choice, I feel like the
girls weird choice,  the weird puppet

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:57.630
characters were awesome I love that they
kept... like you had some kind of idea what

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.080
was happening because of Wizard of Oz
but if you've never read the books

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:06.570
you're like "What the f*ck is going on??" they're like "oh yeah it's troll mountain"
(or Gnome Mountain I don't know it's one of

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:11.460
those) it's- it's *southern accent* Gnome Mountain, and now
like all I want is a Whore series...

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:21.300
Horror...not Whore... and like now like all i want is a
horror series based on Return to Oz, like,

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.840
it just continues the story and it's like a
weekly, like, American Horror Story but

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.130
like just weird puppets...and little girls
who should be older than they are but

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:31.260
it's like they're Benjamin Button...you know...

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:37.080
come on HBO *snaps* I just cannot imagine
watching

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:43.380
this as a child...are you kidding me? Wheeler's? *giggles* no,
no, what the f*ck how did you watch this

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:47.280
as a kid? How did you do that? Oh my god is
that why the Walker brothers are so

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.280
weird? Huh.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:06.250
*Outro music*
