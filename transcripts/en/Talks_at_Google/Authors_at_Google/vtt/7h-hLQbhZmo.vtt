&gt;&gt;Alon: Published last week actually. So here
are the

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.030
highlights. This is what you're going to get
out of the

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.700
book. It's actually very challenging to find
a couple of

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.750
sentences that characterize what I did here.
But the coffee world is a

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.900
very complicated one. It's a very universal
one. And

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.890
so, this book will sort of give you a view
of what's

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.550
going on in the coffee world today in a way
that might

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.910
surprise you. It's very easy to digest. There
are a lot

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.550
of photos. Chapters are like four to six pages.
You can

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.730
sit down for ten minutes; learn something
interesting

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.850
about region of the world. Given that I'm
a database guy,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.809
there are a bunch of data [laughter] -- visualizations,
info

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:52.170
graphics -- stuff like that. [inaudible] And
one of the big features

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.170
that you're going to see there is subculture
of baristas

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:03.019
highfalutin, envelope-pushing baristas that
are really

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.990
advance the coffee world in ways that are
quite

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.450
impressive. And so, you're going to see a
lot of that. You're

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.619
going to see what you thought are the hot
beds of coffee

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:19.240
are not the hot beds of coffee anymore. And
you'll see

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.229
new hot beds -- where they are; what's going
on -- in the

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.719
book. I try to meet a lot of the people that
are

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.080
actually driving innovation in the coffee
world and

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.869
you'll see their stories. Given that you're
going to

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.479
spend so much time in cocktail parties. This
book will

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.020
give you a bunch of good stories to share.
Get a crowd around

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.240
you in a cocktail party. Coffee -- there's
a lot of

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.250
history in coffee and there are books that
you can --

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.469
they're so thick you can actually kill with
them about

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:54.789
coffee history. What I tried to do is distill
it to the

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:00.229
absolutely necessary, hopefully in a reasonably
engaging

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.520
fashion. So you'll get the idea of coffee
history. Now,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.291
when you talk about coffee history, you have
to remember

00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:09.759
one thing -- there is no such thing as coffee
history

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.860
really. It's coffee legend with some analysis
that people

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.920
think of as history. Feel free to make up
your own

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.490
stories. If you tell them often enough, they
might stick. So here's what I'm going to

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.010
do today. As ala Googler. I'm going to tell
you why I did

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.751
this. I'm still trying to figure that out.
I'll tell

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:36.610
you what I did and some of the lessons learned.
This is

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.760
not a sequence. This is -- they're all going
to be

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.260
intermixed, okay?And I'm taking questions.
Anybody who

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.560
has any questions about coffee or all of this
process -- let's make this

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.910
interactive. So, it all started in Caffe del
Doge . This

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.790
is a cafÃ© on University avenue in Palo Alto.
It's been

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.800
renamed to Cafe Venetia a few months ago.
And I used to go there

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.110
every Sunday with my son and ask for a cappuccino
. And

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.130
after awhile I realized there's too much milk
in their

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.376
cappuccinos. But it's a Italian cafe and you
don't

00:03:17.376 --> 00:03:20.450
complain in an Italian cafe unless you can
do it in

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.990
Italian, right?So it took me about six months
until I worked up

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.781
enough courage to say, "you know. your cappuccinos
have a

00:03:27.781 --> 00:03:30.850
little too much milk. Give me something different."
So

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:40.510
they said try the macchiatone. It's a Venetian
specialty. It's

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.420
basically think of it as in the middle between
a

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.210
macchiato and a cappuccino. So macchiato with
a

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.540
little bit more milk. So it's the perfect
combination of

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:57.110
milk and espresso. And it's called different
things in

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.471
different places in the world actually. So
several

00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:03.700
people have honed in on this concept. So I
had this drink. It

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.190
was great. It was perfect. I went and I blogged
about

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.630
it that day. Remember the days when people
used to

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.560
express themselves in more than 140 characters.
So I

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.710
wrote a blog about the macchiatone hoping
to share my

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.590
excitement with the world. And then I started
traveling

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.090
around the world for work and explaining to
people about

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.860
the macchiatone realizing that nobody knows
about the

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.460
macchiatone not even the coffee professionals
of the

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.719
world. So a couple of weeks later, I did a
search on macchiatone . I thin you'll recognize

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:37.729
this search engine. [laughter] And I came
up -- I think this

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:42.160
is still true today, okay? So, this is like
an unknown

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.189
concept. It took me to teach Google. And I
checked on

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:54.370
competition as well. And Bing has six of the
top ten

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:02.039
results on Bing are me, wondering if they'd
heard about the macchiatone. Some of them

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.210
made it to the ACM
website. There was a period where the ACM

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.490
website was
copying a bunch of blog posts from any computer

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.710
scientist who cared to blog.
So all of a sudden macchiatone and ACM came

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.780
up. Pretty
weird. So I realize I was onto something.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.190
Okay? Not a
lot of people know about this. And I wanted

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.909
to discover
why is it that only in very special places

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:27.710
in the world
you can find the macchiatone. In fact, what

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.040
happens is
the macchiatone is known in a very narrow

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:36.139
strip of Italy, between Venice and Verona.
If you go outside those boundaries, you are

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:39.830
-- nobody's going to
know what you're talking about. So I even

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.949
had an Italian
colleague from the University of Washington.

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.580
I sent
him -- well, I didn't send him. He was in

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.080
Naples; I told him to go ask
for a macchiatone in Naples. The guy -- he

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.889
was thrown
out of the cafe telling him this is an American

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.770
invention. We don't know about this here.
[laughter] So that was a

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.550
curiosity. So still going back to why I did
this. At

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.480
the time I started, we were starting Google
Fusion

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.639
Tables. We're still running Google Fusion
Tables. So I needed a personal application

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:12.340
domain where [laughter]
I could really beat on my team on a regular

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.719
basis. This
is a beautiful map that you can create in

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:17.849
thirty-second
with fusion tables that shows where coffee

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:22.580
is produced in
the world. Actually the coffee tables that

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.069
we created --
fusion tables -- are one of the most accessed

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:28.279
tables
because we put them in some of our examples

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:32.960
and it
becomes very useful for people who are trying

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.300
out fusion
tables. You would think when we started -- when

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.229
we did a
search on fusion tables for coffee, two tables

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:46.050
came up --
my tables. Today, when you do a search -- so

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.340
it's a sign
of something. Yeah?

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.910
&gt;&gt;Male #1: That looks like the
Northern Territory Canada has copied us.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:55.560
&gt;&gt; Alon: That is true.
&gt;&gt;Male #1: [inaudible]

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:02.050
&gt;&gt;Alon: See, I think that's what I mean. I
needed a personal example.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:07.370
&gt;&gt;Male #2: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Alon: National parks yes.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:11.969
In a few years actually. This is one of the
things I learned in my port. In a few years

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:14.270
you're probably going to be growing coffee
in

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.520
Canada. The places in the world where you're
growing coffee are changing. But we'll get

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.669
to
the sad part later. This is where coffee is

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:30.749
consumed in the world. Very different. You'll
see that the Scandinavians lead the way in

00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:32.789
coffee consumption. [laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Wow

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:39.289
&gt;&gt;Alon: And of course, coming from
the most advanced coffee culture in a tech

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:42.770
company, I had a really good home base to
start

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.870
from. So, the coffee we have here at Google
is

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:50.229
of the best in the world. I can now tell you
this after going through a lot of suffering

00:07:50.229 --> 00:07:54.180
and
a lot of time on airplanes. This was to me

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.059
very inspiring. The 9 o'clock get together
of

00:07:58.059 --> 00:08:01.570
a bunch of folks -- now, this moved to building
47, right?

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.830
&gt;&gt;Male #3: That's right
&gt;&gt;Alon: You took the machine with you. You

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.280
ruined the entire culture. [laughter]
&gt;&gt;Male #3: We did

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.199
&gt;&gt;Alon: To me
actually I got a lot of work done at Google

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:15.930
just hanging out around the espresso machine
trying to catch certain senior executives

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.270
to
get a few seconds of their time.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:19.800
Male #3: So you published this in your book
so

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.610
people can copy Sanjay's and Louis' badges
and get inner access.

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:28.319
&gt;&gt; Alon: Yes. Yes. Yes. I think even worse
than that. I even did an analysis of the

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:33.229
Google query log using insights for search.
So using a

00:08:33.229 --> 00:08:36.760
publicly facing tool and I tried to understand
what

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.890
people are searching for when they looking
for

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:45.060
coffee. So there's actually a chapter in the
book about Google. This is one of the things

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:47.570
that makes this book stand apart from any
other

00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:53.630
coffee book [laughter] or Steven Levy's for
that matter. I also

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.990
discovered during my -- during working on
this

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:02.630
book that I'm uniquely qualified to do this,
because in my team I have a grandson of a

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:10.310
Columbian coffee farmer who may decide to
reveal himself or may not. A son of somebody

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.820
who
worked for Hills Brothers -- one of the big

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:20.370
American coffee companies which now explains
why he only drinks tea. A former owner of

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:23.970
a
cafe in Seoul, Korea. These are people in

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:28.320
a
relatively small team. I discovered this as

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.730
I
was doing this work.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.740
&gt;&gt; Alon: Okay, so I started -- so with all
this reason to do this, I started doing my

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:36.850
coffee search. I actually really wanted to
use

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:45.350
this as the title of my book, but people told
me not to. I don't know why. When you come

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:47.610
up
with a title for a book -- coming up with

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:51.590
a good
title for a book is the hardest thing to do.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.870
What I did is I delegated it to my wife and
she

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:57.560
came up with the title you're seeing here.
So

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:06.930
I made a plan. I was going to hit all these
places to try to understand how coffee and

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.900
culture play off each other in the world,
okay?

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:14.270
So some of these trips were part of my other
--

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:20.710
my actual day job. Places where I gave talks
or attended conferences. And some maybe not,

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:27.620
okay?
I had to -- I took time off and visited them.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:34.250
So very quickly I discovered this thing that
really captured my imagination. So actually

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:36.030
I
heard about this from Emily Rock who was a

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:41.120
Googler.
And her ex-boyfriend is actually a well-known

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:46.410
guy in the coffee world. So there are
competitions. There are competitions between

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:53.590
baristas for what's called the World Barista
Championship. So this is Mike Phillips -- he's

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:58.840
actually
an American. What they do is they spend--.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.932
You might wonder, 'what is the World Barista
Championship and what do they do?' So

00:11:02.932 --> 00:11:08.460
they have a 15 minute show. You can see these
things on the web where they have to create

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.450
four espressos, four cappuccinos and four
what

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:19.150
they call signature drinks. And there's a
score sheet that, you know, would make, you

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:23.490
know,
it's pretty detailed. And it would make the

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:26.490
in
terms of service that we publish to our users

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.570
to look short and sweet. So they're judged
on

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.870
the quality, on the taste, on the balance,
on

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:35.240
the story, on the crema . All kinds of things.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.590
&gt;&gt;Male # 4: Suspenders?

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:38.840
&gt;&gt;Alon: What?
&gt;&gt;Male # 4: Suspenders

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.720
&gt;&gt;Alon: And sometimes they actually
use -- they accentuate their show with

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:52.190
clothing, with the music that they have. It's
become a complete -- these guys are really

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:56.250
shows men. It's pretty amazing. And there
are

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.940
people from 50 -- over 50 countries that
compete in this. There are national

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:07.190
championships and world championships. Going
through London last year. They have other

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:16.110
competitions. So latte art championship. This
one is a a better one. So this year I went

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:21.430
to
SIGMOD. The big database conference. I'm in

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:25.940
databases. And I've become a very useful guy
to know. So this conference was in Athens.

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.080
So
there's a really, really good cafe in

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:34.430
Athens. So I took people from SIGMOD to this
wonderful cafe because there's the five

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:40.040
time Greek Barista Champion is from this cafe.
and he really sources the best

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:46.570
beans in the world. And the guy says the
Stephanos will be here soon, but I'm the Latte

00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.550
Art Champion of Greece. Okay. You're going
to

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:52.520
make coffee. And so, he was making coffee
for

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:58.340
all the SIGMOD people who were really enjoying
this experience. This is one of his creations.

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.200
And the reason he was so happy to do this
was

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.500
because the week after was the World Latte
Art

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:09.050
Championship. So he was practicing. I brought
him a bunch of guinea pigs to practice his

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:14.280
latte art on. So SIGMOD finished. All the
SIGMOD people went home. I went to the World

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:18.131
Latte
Art Championship. I'm dedicated to the project.

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.620
[laughter]
And what do you know, this Greek guy won the

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:25.530
World
Championship. I'm like, "hey dude, I made

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.640
this
happen."[laughter]I got a big Greek hug

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:34.450
after the thing. And I really felt this was
sort of the putting my SIGMOD and coffee

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:43.740
personality together. It was a great moment.
This is the 2007 world barista champion to

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.230
ever make coffee for me. He's from London.
I

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:48.470
went to visit him at his grocery. You want
to

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:55.671
make me coffee? What do you think? So
actually, this is a good -- some of you know

00:13:55.671 --> 00:14:03.100
the answer, but how -- which country do you
think won the most world barista championships

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:09.360
since it started in 2000? So there have been
11 of them so far.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.360
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Scotland.
&gt;&gt;Alon: Scotland

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.450
&gt;&gt; Male #6: USA.
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Canada

00:14:11.450 --> 00:14:12.450
&gt;&gt;Male #8: Italy
[laughter]

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:16.430
&gt;&gt; Alon: Somebody said Italy, right? Wrong.
The Italians never made it to the top 10.

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:17.430
&gt;&gt;Male #8: Aw, c'mon

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:22.170
&gt;&gt; Alon: Sorry. You guys are too full of yourself.
You

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:30.350
know everything. [laughter] Buy the book first.
So, none

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:32.810
of you got the answer. Not even the people
who

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:36.600
know the answer 'cause I've told them. It's
Denmark. Denmark and

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:42.880
after that Norway and the UK. Actually, this
guy was the first English dude to win it.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.440
And
the US won for the first time. Mike Phillips.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:52.970
This guy won for the first time in 2010. So
the hot beds of coffee are moving away. This

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:56.690
is one of the nice things about the coffee
world. You can walk up to the World Barista

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.530
Champion, this is like two hours after he
won the Championship, and get

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:03.300
a picture. This is Mike Phillips. This guy
is

00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:07.560
Gianni. He's a very special guy in the coffee
world. He just goes around knowing all the

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:12.470
baristas. There's actually a section about
him in the book as well.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:13.660
&gt;&gt;Male #8: He's Italian

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:19.110
&gt;&gt;Alon: He is Italian. [laughter] Main
contribution of Italy to the World

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:23.150
Barista Championship. Not only that, the
machines that they use for the World Barista

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:28.110
Championship are either
Italian or Italian. They compete between La

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:30.640
Marzocco and Nuova Simonelli-- okay?So.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.890
&gt;&gt; Male #8: There you go.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.680
&gt;&gt; Alon: And coffee is grown in Italy everywhere.
[laughter]

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:42.590
People think coffee is grown in Italy. You'd
be surprised how many people think stuff like

00:15:42.590 --> 00:15:43.590
that.

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:46.860
&gt;&gt; Male #8: Tomatoes don't come from there
either.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.680
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Alon: This is a guy practicing for the

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:54.620
World Barista Championship 2020. [laughter]
This is my

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.510
little boy. This project affected my family
in

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:02.380
more than one way. [laughter] So he's six
years old now;

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.690
he was five when he did this. He learned
that in order to bond with his dad, he has

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:06.690
to learn how to
make espresso.

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:07.750
&gt;&gt; Male #9: How many coffees does he have
a day?

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:14.740
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Alon: He can make quite a few. He doesn't

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.530
like the stuff. He'll have a nice foam milk.
So

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:24.320
far, I don't know. So yes. He's a great
espresso maker. There's another kind of

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.260
competition which is on the growing side,
okay?

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:31.680
And this is actually in Brazil. So what they
do there is -- these are farmers. They

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:34.310
submit samples of their coffee and there's
a

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:38.370
jury that comes and judges these coffees,
gives

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:43.000
them scores. There's a national jury. So for
example, in Brazil, there were 250 farmers

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.040
who
entered. The national jury narrowed it down

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:52.170
to
50 samples. And then came the international

00:16:52.170 --> 00:17:00.160
jury. Okay? So I schmoozled my way on to the
international jury in Brazil last year. And

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.960
what you do here is, you get eight coffees
--

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:10.459
eight or ten coffees every round -- and you
start by -- let's see, well, that's me doing

00:17:10.459 --> 00:17:12.891
my
thing. But you start by smelling. There's

00:17:12.891 --> 00:17:15.120
a
lot of smelling going on. So you start by

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:21.120
smelling it when it's just ground. It's very
interesting. Then you pour water into it and

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.630
you wait four minutes and you start smelling
it

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:29.360
again. You remove the crema from the top at
which point the aroma starts exploding in

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.409
a very, very nice way. And
then, you go start tasting. You go around

00:17:32.409 --> 00:17:34.799
the
tables and you taste and you taste for about

00:17:34.799 --> 00:17:37.039
45
minutes. And the coffees actually change their

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:42.850
tastes during this time. Some of them lose
their structure. I learned this term from

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:46.720
listening to the coffee people. And then,
after these 45 minutes, you fill out a form

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.250
and
you give a score. You go into another room

00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:52.249
and you have a discussion.
It's just like a program committee discussion

00:17:52.249 --> 00:17:56.080
in a conference. And people start throwing
all

00:17:56.080 --> 00:18:02.250
kinds of words. The flavors of the coffee.
They throw out all kinds of flavors. That

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:05.620
was
coffee. That was not, you know, what you guys

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:10.380
just said. And then, they start talking about
the acidity. The acidity is really the spirit

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:17.110
of the coffee. The acidity can come in all
kinds of ways. And then you go back and you

00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:18.700
do
another eight coffees and another eight coffees

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:26.220
and you do this all day. It's kind of fun
actually. You slurp. It's just like wine.

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:34.600
You spit most of it out. And this is the
deliberations of the jury. And then at the

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:37.470
end
of the week, we went through round one, two,

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:43.970
and three. We gave an award to this very lucky
person. The interesting thing about this is

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:50.070
that the coffees that get the Cup of Excellence
stamp on them, they participate in an Internet

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:55.360
auction. So roasters from all around the world
can bid for these things. So this guy, for

00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:02.950
example, sold his lot for something like 25
dollars a pound. Compare this to three that

00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:06.770
you would get on the market for -- that's
the

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.960
running price, okay? So these guys really
--

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.480
now, he's not selling his whole, you know,
crop

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:18.850
for this, but again, it's more the glory -- I
mean, this guy is one out of 350,000 farmers

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:23.370
in
Brazil; he's the "Cup of Excellence". It helps

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:26.249
the -- that's the other
interesting thing here -- it creates direct

00:19:26.249 --> 00:19:30.460
relationships between farmers and roasters
and

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:32.500
importers. So before this what happened is
all

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:37.879
the farmers in Brazil take their coffees and
they put it into four big bins. And what you

00:19:37.879 --> 00:19:42.710
get is, you get four choices of coffees from
Brazil. Where in any country that grows coffee,

00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:48.130
you get hundreds of
really interesting different flavors of coffee.

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:53.649
So now, they can work directly with the
roasters. The roasters can come invest in

00:19:53.649 --> 00:19:56.749
a
particular farm, work with them multiple years

00:19:56.749 --> 00:20:00.779
and really create a relationship. And that
completely changes the dynamics of the

00:20:00.779 --> 00:20:06.440
coffee world. And this happened in the last
ten years. We always think as tech people

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.570
we're advancing the world at a speed no one
can

00:20:10.570 --> 00:20:12.260
catch up. But the changes in coffee world
in the

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:20.349
last 15 years have been mind boggling. I
went -- this is in Costa Rica. So this is

00:20:20.349 --> 00:20:24.070
--
this is how coffee comes, okay?This is where

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:29.399
coffee comes from. These cherries which you
can actually chew on. And in fact, people

00:20:29.399 --> 00:20:31.090
for
many years only chewed on them before they

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.779
realized there's something good in here we
can

00:20:33.779 --> 00:20:38.571
roast and put in our lattes. This is what
they

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:42.769
come from. So it's a very colorful activity
if

00:20:42.769 --> 00:20:50.840
you like. So I tried to cover -- I tried to
follow coffee history a little bit. I went

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.360
to
Ethiopia. So those of you who know Yirgacheffe

00:20:54.360 --> 00:21:00.179
is a region that's known for its very wonderful
coffees. You can see Yirgacheffe. I went to

00:21:00.179 --> 00:21:08.350
the Yirgacheffe. This is a really interesting
experience. After the -- from Ethiopia, coffee

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.419
moved on to the Arabian peninsula, to the
Ottoman

00:21:11.419 --> 00:21:18.100
Empire. I tried to go to the Ottoman Empire.
Turns out it's too late. [laughter] But I

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:23.029
went pretty
close. This is the old city in Jerusalem where

00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:27.590
you go there and you think
you're in the Ottoman Empire. Actually, it's

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:30.919
kind of interesting. The story of how coffee
came

00:21:30.919 --> 00:21:41.710
into the world is kind of vague. So the legend
that everybody knows about is how the goat

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:47.420
herder who saw his goats prancing and he said,
"Oh, why are they dancing?They were eating

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:52.649
some red cherries. And he said I'll have some
of that. [laughter] Actually about he said

00:21:52.649 --> 00:21:56.350
let me wait a
day. See what happens to my goats. If they're

00:21:56.350 --> 00:22:00.320
still alive tomorrow, I'll also have some
of

00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.070
that. [laughter] But actually, what turns
out is what is

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:10.970
the leading theory today is that discovering
coffee was actually due to the Chinese, which

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:15.899
is kind of not what you would expect. What
happened was in the 15th century, there were

00:22:15.899 --> 00:22:18.559
a
bunch of fleet -- very big ships that came

00:22:18.559 --> 00:22:22.460
from
China to Yemen. They were looking for all

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:26.809
kinds of great things from Africa. They were
bringing giraffes back for the emperor and

00:22:26.809 --> 00:22:31.259
stuff like that. There
were 200 ship fleets. And they came to Yemen

00:22:31.259 --> 00:22:32.429
and
they brought their tea with them. And the

00:22:32.429 --> 00:22:36.580
Arabs saw that you can actually put a leaf
in

00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:43.179
hot water and get something good out of it.
And very abruptly , the Chinese stopped

00:22:43.179 --> 00:22:47.440
sending -- they decided one day to stop this
fleet. And the Arabs were like, "hey, where

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.760
is
our tea? We need this tea. " So they started

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:54.210
looking around,
"where are we going to find some tea?" So

00:22:54.210 --> 00:22:55.519
they
walked over -- not walked over -- they went

00:22:55.519 --> 00:23:01.080
over -- in the Red Sea there's a very narrow
passage from Yemen to Ethiopia. And they

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:07.710
started looking around and they found the
leaves of the coffee tree in Ethiopia. After

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:11.519
awhile, they realized there was something
actually better than the leaves. There was

00:23:11.519 --> 00:23:14.299
the bean and you could roast it but that took
another hundred years.

00:23:14.299 --> 00:23:22.350
So that's the leading theory how coffee
became something that we drink today. In Ethiopia,

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:28.610
3,000 years ago, people were chewing the bean.
They were making golf ball sized snacks out

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:33.500
of it
before they went out to war. That is how they

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:37.690
consumed coffee. So, I also, you know, in
my

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:47.220
dedication to the project, I paid a lot of
money for coffee. So until 2009, my 7 dollars

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:51.481
was the most I paid for a cup of coffee. I
broke that record quite -- 65 dollars. But

00:23:51.481 --> 00:23:56.980
the
vast majority of that is the parking tickets.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:03.450
I did this in LA. And San Francisco. So the
problem was I parked before I had coffee.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:07.020
But
the real record was in Japan where I paid

00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.860
140
dollars for a cup of coffee and the reason

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:13.460
was I was visiting the Barista Champion of
Japan and she told me, "well, we're just really

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.669
close to Tokyo. Why don't you come out and
visit our cafe." And it turns out

00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:22.809
really close to Tokyo was like a 2-hour train
ride from Tokyo which cost me 140 bucks. But

00:24:22.809 --> 00:24:26.590
when I got
there, I got a free espresso. [laughter] But

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:31.570
it was really good. The
Japanese are one of the best -- the Japanese

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:38.500
and the Norwegians are the two cultures that
are pushing coffee to their extremes. In Norway,

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:41.249
it's because people have money, so they can
pay

00:24:41.249 --> 00:24:48.489
more for coffee. In Japan, it's because people
are used to paying more for good stuff. It's

00:24:48.489 --> 00:24:50.230
part of
their culture. I got a life. So now on

00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:56.100
Facebook, I see a person with 80 or so mutual
friends with me, it's guaranteed to be

00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:59.220
a coffee person. One of my celebrated days
was

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:03.360
when the Specialty Coffee Association of
America decided to follow me on Twitter.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:08.320
[laughter] That's pretty cool. Two weeks
later the European Specialty Coffee Association

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.090
decided
to follow me on Twitter. There are a bunch

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:12.950
of
cafes in San Francisco that follow me on

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:18.559
Twitter. That's actually cool. I don't
actually tweet that much. Apparently that

00:25:18.559 --> 00:25:23.429
doesn't matter. Then I went to a bunch of
exotic

00:25:23.429 --> 00:25:27.850
places. On the plane to London on the way
to the World Barista Championship, I saw this

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:33.309
photo. And
this is an Icelandic family. So this woman,

00:25:33.309 --> 00:25:40.000
IngibjÃ¶rg, is
the -- she was the Icelandic Barista Champion

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.440
in 2010. Her brother, Tumi, was the coffee
tasting

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:48.830
champion of Iceland. They're -- I'll tell
you

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:53.139
about that competition in a moment. [laughter]
Now, their

00:25:53.139 --> 00:25:54.419
father -- you know, there aren't that many
jobs

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:57.929
in Iceland today. [laughter] Their father
-- he's a

00:25:57.929 --> 00:26:01.860
minister by training, he's a tourist guide,
and

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:07.169
he teaches elementary schools, and he teaches
web 2.0 at the University of

00:26:07.169 --> 00:26:11.830
Iceland. I made the mistake of telling him
about fusion tables. And two days later he

00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:16.220
sent me an e-mail saying, "oh, you have a
bug

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.789
here, a bug there."[laughter] Don't bug me
with your bugs. But we fixed them all. So

00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:22.100
he
was looking for something to do, because his

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:23.700
children were winning awards in coffee and
he

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.429
had a lot of time on his hands. So there's
a

00:26:25.429 --> 00:26:28.629
competition called Coffee in Good Spirits
where you

00:26:28.629 --> 00:26:33.279
create interesting drinks with alcohol and
coffee. [laughter] This is one of the big

00:26:33.279 --> 00:26:37.120
competitions
that goes on every year. And he entered the

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:42.309
competition and what do you know, he won the
Icelandic Coffee in Good Spirits Championship

00:26:42.309 --> 00:26:46.899
beating out all five other people. [laughter]
So these guys

00:26:46.899 --> 00:26:53.690
were pretty upset because now their dad was
coming on their glory trip to London for the

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:55.379
World Barista Championship. But apparently
he

00:26:55.379 --> 00:26:57.950
behaved well. So I met them in London. And
I

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:03.830
said you guys are great. It's a great story.
I need to write about you guys. So they said

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:10.869
why don't you come to Reykjavik. I said why
not. So I hopped on a plane and went to

00:27:10.869 --> 00:27:19.360
Reykjavik. And so, they -- I need to explain.
This is their summer house [laughter] So they

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:25.201
hosted me for dinner at their summer house.
This is in -- outside the city of Selfoss.

00:27:25.201 --> 00:27:31.309
Selfoss is a city of one hour away from
Reykjavik. It's known mostly for being the

00:27:31.309 --> 00:27:36.299
burial place of Bobby Fischer, the chess player.
But this is

00:27:36.299 --> 00:27:42.509
you go out of Selfoss and he showed me. See
that house over there?That's where we're

00:27:42.509 --> 00:27:45.529
going. So I'm sitting there with a family
of,

00:27:45.529 --> 00:27:51.059
you know, six -- they were each one brought
their girlfriend or spouse or whatever. And

00:27:51.059 --> 00:27:53.032
here I am sitting basically at the tip of
the

00:27:53.032 --> 00:27:58.320
world with all these people discussing the
right balance between coffee and alcohol in

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.470
an
Irish coffee. And this is one of the more

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:08.799
interesting moments of this trip -- of this
whole experience. And this is Carlos making

00:28:08.799 --> 00:28:12.909
--
these are -- these were fantastic. Notice,

00:28:12.909 --> 00:28:14.919
you
get judged on the separation here. So this

00:28:14.919 --> 00:28:21.379
line here has to be very clean, okay?These
Irish coffees are just like totally sublime.

00:28:21.379 --> 00:28:27.600
I
wish I could make anything that looks like

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:33.610
that. This is another -- this is a store owner
in -- bookstore owner in Selfoss. He was -- so

00:28:33.610 --> 00:28:37.980
Carlos took me here on his way to the summer
house. This guy used to be a member of

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:45.570
Parliament of Iceland. Until one day he responded
to an e-mail saying exactly what he thinks

00:28:45.570 --> 00:28:48.269
about his party members. He didn't realize
he

00:28:48.269 --> 00:28:52.249
was CCing the entire party. [laughter] Two
days later he

00:28:52.249 --> 00:29:00.609
was an owner of the bookstore. [laughter]
Icelandic politics are pretty rough.

00:29:00.609 --> 00:29:03.090
Male #10: [inaudible]

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:07.389
&gt;&gt;Alon: So, this
is another very different experience.

00:29:07.389 --> 00:29:12.429
Sarajevo. So I actually -- when I was sitting
in Ritual Coffee in San Francisco one day,

00:29:12.429 --> 00:29:15.320
I sat
next to a guy who heard I was writing a book

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:18.450
on world
coffee culture. And he said, "you have to

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:21.909
go
to Bosnia" And I'm like, "Dude, I'm not going

00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:24.940
to Bosnia, right now." But I remembered the
comment.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:30.989
And then, when I was in Vienna, I was sitting
in one of the Grand Cafes in Vienna. The waiter

00:29:30.989 --> 00:29:33.701
come up to me and says,"You know, you're writing
a coffee book. I have a story

00:29:33.701 --> 00:29:38.179
for you. I'm not sure it's a very good story
but what the heck; it's free." He says, "one

00:29:38.179 --> 00:29:42.760
day I was sitting in
Bosnia in Sarajevo in a cafe. I had coffee.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:48.419
I got up; I wanted to leave the cafe
pay and leave. And I go to the waiter. He

00:29:48.419 --> 00:29:51.989
tells me, "Mister, I will pay for your coffee
but

00:29:51.989 --> 00:29:55.980
never come back to this cafe again". I drank,
I

00:29:55.980 --> 00:30:02.739
paid. What am I supposed to do. In Sarajevo,
we don't just drink our coffee and go. We

00:30:02.739 --> 00:30:04.950
sit
here for hours. If you leave here now you're

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:07.850
insulting me". So once I heard that story,
I

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:12.409
said, "OK, I need to go to Bosnia. I started
through

00:30:12.409 --> 00:30:18.679
my social network. I found people in Bosnia
that actually hosted me very nicely. And apparently,

00:30:18.679 --> 00:30:22.109
the coffee
culture in Bosnia is probably the deepest

00:30:22.109 --> 00:30:27.129
that I've
seen anywhere in the world. Maybe close to

00:30:27.129 --> 00:30:33.230
Ethiopia. But really everything around there
is about -- I mean, a lot of social

00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:38.210
interactions are deeply ingrained around
coffee, okay?And that led to one of my finest

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:42.340
moments. After publishing many SIGMOD papers,
I

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:48.440
was invited to publish a paper in Barista
Magazine. [laughter] That was really -- and

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.559
they heard I
was going to Bosnia. The coffee in Bosnia

00:30:51.559 --> 00:30:55.369
isn't very good. The coffee people are not
going there. But I published my paper about

00:30:55.369 --> 00:31:02.094
my trip to Bosnia in Barista
It was one of my finest, finest, and proudest

00:31:02.094 --> 00:31:06.240
moments. I also went to some of the
classical -- where is the Italian in the crowd.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.340
[laughter]
One of the classical locations. This is a

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:13.179
nice
one. If you're interested in chocolate and

00:31:13.179 --> 00:31:19.929
coffee coming together, go to Torino. They
have invented, 200 years ago, the drink called

00:31:19.929 --> 00:31:26.060
the Bicerin, which is a combination of chocolate,
espresso and milk. It's wonderful. Everywhere

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:29.259
you go in
Torino, people will give you or that's the

00:31:29.259 --> 00:31:35.720
main thing, this Bicerin, that Bicerin. My
wife

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:42.179
enjoying. This is in the cafe that the
original Bicerin Cafe in Torino. So it's a

00:31:42.179 --> 00:31:44.659
very
different kind of experience. So I also went

00:31:44.659 --> 00:31:48.799
to some of the more classical places in Europe.
And you know the one thing about coffee is

00:31:48.799 --> 00:31:50.359
--
people ask me where is the best coffee in

00:31:50.359 --> 00:31:52.200
the
world right now and stuff like that. Coffee

00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:56.100
is really a combination of the
quality of coffee and the experience -- who

00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:00.470
you
are having the coffee with. And there are

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:05.340
places in the world that are based on --
emphasizing the experience. So the entire

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:07.169
city
of Paris is based on the fact that the

00:32:07.169 --> 00:32:14.619
experience is enough and the coffee can be
really, really bad. [laughter] So I just

00:32:14.619 --> 00:32:20.110
wanted to point that out. There are a few
other cities that I will not mention. But

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:24.759
Italy is fine. I really do enjoy the coffee
there. Usually if I'm close enough, I will

00:32:24.759 --> 00:32:28.889
drive into Italy just to have the coffee.
Male #11: [inaudible]

00:32:28.889 --> 00:32:34.909
&gt;&gt;Alon: And
I went to Italy three times. [laughter]I

00:32:34.909 --> 00:32:39.240
want to thank Peter Norvig here who made the
mistake of telling me he was going to Italy

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.679
and
came back with some great photos that are

00:32:41.679 --> 00:32:46.379
in
the book of cafes in Venice. Okay? There are

00:32:46.379 --> 00:32:53.889
a few people who contributed photos to the
book. So I want to thank them all. One of

00:32:53.889 --> 00:32:58.499
my
big surprises was Australia. Go to Melbourne.

00:32:58.499 --> 00:33:03.389
Melbourne is -- if I had to retire and just
spend my time going between cafe and cafe,

00:33:03.389 --> 00:33:06.200
I
would now move to Melbourne. There is no other

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.779
place in the world that is such a -- sorry
New Zealand. New Zealand has a fine

00:33:10.779 --> 00:33:17.450
fine coffee culture. In fact, it was one of
the countries that inspired me to write this

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:18.450
book.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:20.629
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Yeah yeah yeah.
[laughter]

00:33:20.629 --> 00:33:26.450
&gt;&gt; Alon: But sorry, Australia is -- this guy
created, on his own, espresso machine that

00:33:26.450 --> 00:33:30.100
has
six group heads. And he's got six grinders

00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:32.340
to
go with it. So they doesn't want to mix up

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.460
grinds and group heads. He's got a grinder
for

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:40.860
every group head. The guy is a real hacker
when it comes to coffee machines. He's Proud

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:45.470
Mary Cafe in Melbourne. Sydney is pretty good,
too. So everywhere in Australia. So there

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:50.070
are
two kinds of countries in the world. Those

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:54.399
who
were sort of born before coffee. And so,

00:33:54.399 --> 00:34:02.359
they -- the evolution of the culture and coffee
took place and coffee is varying in quality.

00:34:02.359 --> 00:34:06.460
And then, there were countries coffee came
after it was already at a certain level. So

00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:13.360
for example, Australia, a bunch of Italians
moved in the 1950s, they jump started

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:22.050
a really good coffee culture already. Yes.
Had to do this, too. In Cambodia, I had the

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:28.020
worst cup of coffee possible. But then I
noticed that in the hotel menu, they had a

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:31.409
coffee body rub. So what you're seeing here
is

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:38.299
a bunch of ground coffee. This which I swear
was the same as they served in the cup. [laughter]

00:34:38.299 --> 00:34:43.549
This
was oil. So they spend an hour just rubbing

00:34:43.549 --> 00:34:45.800
coffee grounds into you. Which, you know,
is actually

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:53.760
pretty good. Smelling like a tall latte for
two days. [laughter] I would do it again.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:35:00.000
In
fact, I did it in Costa Rica after that.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.599
United States of America, okay. So this is
one

00:35:02.599 --> 00:35:07.970
of the -- I have a section in the book about
the United States. It's a sad story for the

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:12.521
first 200 years. Fortunately, due to Alfred
Peet

00:35:12.521 --> 00:35:21.250
. This is his first store in Berkeley. He
turned things around; he showed people that

00:35:21.250 --> 00:35:28.900
coffee is actually an art and should not be
judged by the level of the commercial on TV.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:34.500
And basically all the great coffee we know
about today is the inspiration of Alfred Peet.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:39.450
That's not to say the roast -- Alfred Pete
actually had a relatively dark roast and he

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:42.089
actually
trained the Starbucks guys how to roast and

00:35:42.089 --> 00:35:45.970
brew coffee.
But the idea that there is so much going into

00:35:45.970 --> 00:35:49.630
coffee came from Alfred Peet
and then a whole bunch of other people made

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:53.829
it into
what it is today. So today you can go to

00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:59.270
places like Four Barrel or hang out at Google
and have Four Barrel coffee and you're really

00:35:59.270 --> 00:36:06.190
getting some of the best coffee in the world.
How did I approach the coffee world? I didn't

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:07.819
know
anybody in the coffee world. When I started

00:36:07.819 --> 00:36:10.319
I
had to get my way in. Of course there's the

00:36:10.319 --> 00:36:13.690
infinite charm of a database expert trying
to

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:15.811
help you with your data needs, right? [laughter]
So I

00:36:15.811 --> 00:36:21.670
approached people with fusion tables and saying
"hey, I can map your data and show you all

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:23.890
kinds
of things." Sometimes that worked. But when

00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:27.160
that didn't work, there's always schwag. I
traveled

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:31.970
around the world giving people various Google
schwag

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:37.339
items; that really opened any door I wanted.
This is my host in Bosnia. I gave her more

00:36:37.339 --> 00:36:45.430
than a hat. But she was so happy. And then,
she had a birthday a little later that her

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:47.961
mom
made her a Google cake with a Google hat and

00:36:47.961 --> 00:36:56.329
you can see happiness. [laughter] So if you
see -- so there are a lot of coffee people

00:36:56.329 --> 00:37:00.590
going around meeting at highfalutin coffee
conferences comparing their Google schwag

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:01.590
now. And
that --

00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:02.800
&gt;&gt;Male #12: That's your fault.

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:08.289
&gt;&gt; Alon: I take credit for it. This is it.
The only thing to notice here is, this is

00:37:08.289 --> 00:37:11.690
the
only coffee book ever written that has a quote

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:12.690
from Vint Cerf. [laughter]And I don't know
if

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:25.190
you can read it. But it is really well-said.
And then, there's the World Barista Champion

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:28.740
and the editor in chief of Barista Magazine.

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:30.509
&gt;&gt;Male #13: No Italian.

00:37:30.509 --> 00:37:33.640
&gt;&gt; Alon: No Italian, [audience groans] but
there's a chapter

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:35.880
about Italy. I say really nice things about
Italy.

00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.190
&gt;&gt; Male #14: Isn't Vint really Italian?
&gt;&gt;Alon: Huh?

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:44.660
&gt;&gt;Male #14: Isn't Vint an Italian name?
&gt;&gt; Alon: Maybe it is. Maybe.

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:50.079
&gt;&gt; Male #14: Sounds like it. [inaudible]
[laughter]

00:37:50.079 --> 00:37:56.530
&gt;&gt; Alon: Maybe. So that's it. That's --
I'll take any -- you know, the one lesson

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.970
that
I wanted to convey is the coffee world is

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:02.810
moving really, really fast. Coffee is really
from the moment you take these cherries off

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:04.943
the
tree until you dip them in the cup, the process

00:38:04.943 --> 00:38:08.309
is really
difficult. It's being pushed forward by a

00:38:08.309 --> 00:38:14.099
network of people in the world. It was really
amazing to be part of that community and see

00:38:14.099 --> 00:38:17.040
how things are changing. I really appreciate
the

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.289
coffee that you have here at Google. [laughter]

00:38:19.289 --> 00:38:21.789
&gt;&gt; Male #15: Great book and good talking.
I think you should be

00:38:21.789 --> 00:38:27.390
on the Discovery Channel, have your own show.
I have a question. When I was a kid growing

00:38:27.390 --> 00:38:31.720
up, mom made us instant coffee and we loved
it.

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:39.220
And now, I hear in parts of the world, instant
coffee is coming back into style. Do you run

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:40.220
across that anywhere?

00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:44.951
&gt;&gt; Alon: No. So I grew up on instant coffee
and I liked it. And when I was doing my

00:38:44.951 --> 00:38:49.670
military service, having a cup of instant
coffee was something I would actually spend

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:56.400
an
entire hour crafting and putting together.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:03.380
There's a return of drip coffee, so where
people pour, you know, non-espresso type preparations

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:04.780
of
coffee. And that's certainly making a

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:10.430
comeback. But I have not heard instant coffee
make a comeback.

00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:14.809
&gt;&gt; Male #16: How about Vienna?When I went
there --it was a while ago-- I was shocked

00:39:14.809 --> 00:39:20.440
at the fact that just
side by side with the Soccer Cafe there is

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.540
a
Starbucks?

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:22.640
&gt;&gt; Alon: Yes.

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.839
&gt;&gt;Male #16: What happened?

00:39:24.839 --> 00:39:28.539
&gt;&gt; Alon: So there's a chapter about Starbucks
in the book. And I try to be nice just in

00:39:28.539 --> 00:39:31.650
case
they come to me and say they want to sell

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:33.549
the
books in Starbucks. But I think Starbucks

00:39:33.549 --> 00:39:37.980
should be credited with really taking espresso
worldwide and shows that there is potential

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:42.349
here. A
lot of the -- what people call the third wave

00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:47.380
coffee. Think of Starbucks as being second
wave. Think of instant coffee as being first

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:55.339
wave. So a lot of the third wave coffee people
are here because Starbucks sort of, you know,

00:39:55.339 --> 00:39:58.541
upped the ante and made it very ubiquitous.
So

00:39:58.541 --> 00:40:01.680
now you see much better coffee coming up right
next to Starbucks.

00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:05.109
&gt;&gt;Male #16 Do you think Vienna needs a
Starbucks?

00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:09.730
&gt;&gt;Alon: I don't think Vienna needs a
Starbucks. I think the Viennese probably realized

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:14.010
it, too. The best
coffee I had in Vienna was Espresso pub where

00:40:14.010 --> 00:40:17.200
they have these very colorful displays of
all

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:20.599
their capsules with different colors. You
go

00:40:20.599 --> 00:40:22.980
in there and tell them you're writing a book.
They give you a free espresso and that was

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:36.089
the best coffee I had. So the coffee itself
in Vienna was not great. &gt;&gt;Male #17: I'm from

00:40:36.089 --> 00:40:42.560
Oslo in Norway. Is the aeropress coffee
spreading around the world?

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:46.859
&gt;&gt;Alon: Yeah. So a few years ago I don't
think it even existed. Certainly. Aeropress

00:40:46.859 --> 00:40:53.330
is one of the great ways to have really high
quality coffee. Especially if you're traveling

00:40:53.330 --> 00:40:58.410
and you want really good coffee. In fact,
there is an Aeropress World Championship.

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:03.480
Congratulations on coming from Oslo. I had
the

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:09.630
best roaster in the world is from Oslo. In
fact, the first World Barista Champion is

00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:10.799
from
Oslo. Yeah?

00:41:10.799 --> 00:41:15.460
&gt;&gt;Male #18: Have you had Kopi Luwak and what
did you think?

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.369
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; So the most frequent question I get

00:41:17.369 --> 00:41:25.660
as I was writing this book is, "did you hear
about that cat that -- or the monkey that

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:28.619
has
the thing". So there's a lot of misinformation

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:31.740
about it. Yes, so it's called Kopi Luwak.
There's a civet cat

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:35.670
that goes around -- what's interesting about
the civet cat is it actually goes in the fields.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:39.190
It
knows how to choose the right cherries. And

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:45.839
then it digests -- eats the cherries. Comes
out from the other side and hopefully then

00:41:45.839 --> 00:41:55.529
cleans very thoroughly. And then, it's -- I
didn't like it. I had it. There's a section

00:41:55.529 --> 00:41:59.829
in the book about it. The -- what's happening
is that people realize they can make a lot

00:41:59.829 --> 00:42:03.059
of
money doing this. So instead of having civet

00:42:03.059 --> 00:42:07.160
cats
run wild in the fields choosing the cherries,

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:12.520
they put them in cages and they start feeding
them cherries and they charge the same prices.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:18.539
So it's one of the poster child, gimmick coffees
that you see all over the world. There's a

00:42:18.539 --> 00:42:25.380
great quote from George Howell who's one of
the big names of coffee in the U.S. I'm not

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:28.819
sure I
can -- well, I'm among friends. He says Kopi

00:42:28.819 --> 00:42:34.410
Luwak is coffee
from ass holes for ass holes. [laughter] I'm

00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:37.190
just messing with you.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:41.180
&gt;&gt; Male #19: When you had that competition
in

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:46.869
Brazil where you were tasting all the beans,
how do we normalize for all the different

00:42:46.869 --> 00:42:47.910
ways to
roast beans?

00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:49.799
&gt;&gt; Alon: They all roast together. So it's
a

00:42:49.799 --> 00:42:58.730
very uniform roast. But you could argue that
that doesn't actually bring out the expression

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:03.950
of every coffee. So every coffee could be
brought out with a slightly different roast.

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:06.160
But that would be--

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:11.150
&gt;&gt; Male #20: What was the tasting competition?
&gt;&gt;Alon: Huh?

00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:12.310
&gt;&gt; Male #20: The tasting competition?
&gt;&gt;Alon: The taste?

00:43:12.310 --> 00:43:13.699
&gt;&gt;Male #21: What does it take to be a tasting
champion?

00:43:13.699 --> 00:43:19.080
&gt;&gt; Alon: So what they do is, it's really
interesting. What they do is they give you

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.599
triangulation tests. So they give you three
cups

00:43:22.599 --> 00:43:24.990
of coffee and two of them are identical and
one

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:28.720
is different. So the trick is to guess which
one is different. So you have eight sets of

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:32.230
three. And the person who guesses the most
is

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:38.250
the winner. And if there's a tie, then time
matters. In fact, the Ritual Coffee here has

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:43.359
like the 3-time U.S. champion Ben Kaminsky.
And

00:43:43.359 --> 00:43:47.500
actually, this year, it was really interesting
because there was this Greek guy who said,

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:50.770
"you
know? I'm not going to taste. I'm just going

00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:57.600
to look." So he looked at the coffee and he
-- [mumbles inaudibly] --

00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:02.289
and this was very amusing in the first round.
And you can amusing in the second round. But

00:44:02.289 --> 00:44:08.990
he won the world championship [laughter] And
so, I was talking to the guy who invented

00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:10.580
the
competition right after that. He said, "well,

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:15.920
we're changing the rules next year. And so,
what they're going to have is, they're going

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:19.510
to -- first of all, the cups are not going
to

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:23.350
be white. So they're going to be black. So
you can't actually see that much. And they're

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.349
not going to have that much lighting on the
--.

00:44:25.349 --> 00:44:28.170
Male #22: Use blindfolds
[laughter]

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:31.140
&gt;&gt;Alon: The thing is when he looked, he could
actually

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:37.319
do it faster. So he actually won on time
against a guy who actually tasted the coffee.

00:44:37.319 --> 00:44:39.339
[laughter]
But it's interesting competition. It's really

00:44:39.339 --> 00:44:45.490
hard. Even the winners. The winner of the
world championship got four out of eight correct.

00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:54.119
If they hit five or six, it's like "Whoa".
It's really hard. [laughter]

00:44:54.119 --> 00:44:58.529
&gt;&gt;Female #2: I got to ask. Do you do the
Caribbean?

00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:01.049
&gt;&gt; Alon: Do I cover the Caribbean. No, I
don't. I cover central. Sorry. So let me

00:45:01.049 --> 00:45:02.320
start with apologies. [laughter] I apologize
to the

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:07.760
nation of India. I have many Indian friends.
I would like to go to India; they have an

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.910
interesting coffee culture. Second edition.
I apologize to the country of

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:13.339
Canada that has a great coffee culture, but
I

00:45:13.339 --> 00:45:14.690
didn't find the great story to tell about
Canada. I

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:15.690
didn't want to just go around and just say,
"oh,

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:19.839
here's a bunch of cafes in Toronto or Vancouver.
I

00:45:19.839 --> 00:45:25.680
wanted a really interesting story. I apologize
to New Zealand. I do not apologize to Italy.

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:34.270
I think I gave you all the respect you deserve.
[laughter]And the entire Indonesia -- you

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:36.180
know, that whole region. I just did not go
to

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:43.279
it. I have a day job. Sorry. So there are
probably a few other apologies. But.

00:45:43.279 --> 00:45:50.099
&gt;&gt; Male #23: So, I was reading about Brazilian
coffee. Apparently historically it's not great

00:45:50.099 --> 00:45:54.390
quality. But it sounds both like you're
optimistic and it seems to be coming up in

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:57.109
quality in
the past couple of years. One of the stories

00:45:57.109 --> 00:46:01.960
I
heard because of the processing practices

00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:05.470
of
the past, there's an unusual taste or flavor

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:09.210
associated with Brazilian coffee. Is that
still true?

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:15.280
&gt;&gt; Alon: We have a Brazilian in the room who
can [chuckles] comment. Louis.

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:20.640
&gt;&gt; Louis: I have a feeling you probably know
more about Brazilian coffee than I do at this

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:25.490
point. [laughter] Yeah, Brazilian coffee has
never been

00:46:25.490 --> 00:46:31.550
very good until the last ten years. And then
the phenomenon Alon just mentioned in that

00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:34.029
local producers began sort of getting direct
access

00:46:34.029 --> 00:46:39.559
to markets and getting better quality. The
majority of the coffee grown in Brazil is

00:46:39.559 --> 00:46:42.710
still
crap, but there's a few ones that are really

00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:43.710
fantastic.

00:46:43.710 --> 00:46:45.470
&gt;&gt; Male #23: I believe that. That's why I
was

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:49.690
curious about the change over time. At one
time, the practice in Brazil was just to strip

00:46:49.690 --> 00:46:52.350
the tree rather than pick the cherries.

00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:53.350
&gt;&gt; Louis: Yeah.

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:57.720
&gt;&gt; Louis: I grew up in the coffee farm. And
we made very bad coffee [laughter].

00:46:57.720 --> 00:47:01.789
&gt;&gt; Louis: But I don't know that there's a
signature taste from Brazil.

00:47:01.789 --> 00:47:03.130
&gt;&gt;Alon: So Brazil is so big.
&gt;&gt;Male #23: It's so big

00:47:03.130 --> 00:47:09.400
&gt;&gt;Louis: So much stuff. And if you go from
the north of the Brazil to the south, the

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.559
weather variations are just so crazy.

00:47:11.559 --> 00:47:18.250
&gt;&gt;Male #23: The story I remember hearing is
because there's so much, you know, difficulty

00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:23.309
in processing coffee, a lot of it would mold.
And so, that taste of the mold in the coffee

00:47:23.309 --> 00:47:25.780
became a distinctive signature flavor. And
I

00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:29.700
was curious, you know, civet cats is one thing,
mold

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:34.610
is another thing. And I wonder if you notice
other regional variations due to sort of odd

00:47:34.610 --> 00:47:36.250
factors like that.

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:41.180
&gt;&gt; Louis: Brazil has this historical -- we
only learned about espresso in the last 15

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:47.990
years, right?We all did this cloth filtering
process for coffee. But unlike the filter

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:51.450
drip
coffee we have around here, it's very

00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:56.750
fine-ground. So that's -- and you know, my
family had.

00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:57.750
[laughter]

00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:05.500
&gt;&gt; Alon: There is a particular flavor called
Rio which is -- and it's something that for

00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:08.619
example in the Arab countries is actually
very

00:48:08.619 --> 00:48:14.460
prized in coffee. But you know in the cupping
competition if you would identify Rio in the

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:21.900
cup, it would be eliminated. So a lot of these
things are subjective. But Brazil is such

00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.750
a
huge country and the farms are so large. I

00:48:24.750 --> 00:48:29.599
mean, we went to a farm that produced more
coffee than the entire country of Bolivia,

00:48:29.599 --> 00:48:36.150
which is substantial. And it's grown in
relatively low altitudes compared to a lot

00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:40.260
of
the other places. So the flavors tend to be

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:45.720
sweeter, more chocolatety, caramelly things.
And so, it provides a good base for a lot

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:51.730
of espresso.
You'll see a lot of espressos with a lot of

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:59.049
Brazil in them with a few other things.

00:48:59.049 --> 00:49:00.306
&gt;&gt; Louis: The taste for roasting, it's lighter
roast.

00:49:00.306 --> 00:49:01.306
&gt;&gt; Alon: Yeah.

00:49:01.306 --> 00:49:02.306
&gt;&gt; Louis: Do coffee growers generally like
coffee?

00:49:02.306 --> 00:49:08.839
&gt;&gt; Alon: That's changing. So if you go to
what I would call the leading coffee growers,

00:49:08.839 --> 00:49:15.670
they're actually learning cupping and learning
barista activities and -- it's actually really

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:20.970
interesting to see. When I went to Central
America, you know the coffee grower that I

00:49:20.970 --> 00:49:24.480
was
visiting -- Aida Batlle-- she's a fifth generation

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:27.470
coffee
grower. She just got this highfalutin espresso

00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:33.380
machine. And she got a certificate from the
Barista Association of America that she's

00:49:33.380 --> 00:49:36.059
a
certified barista. It's actually really interesting

00:49:36.059 --> 00:49:40.369
to see the
producers and the baristas are coming together.

00:49:40.369 --> 00:49:45.969
In fact, this year was the first time a barista
from the producing country won the

00:49:45.969 --> 00:49:52.329
championship from El Salvador. It was mind-boggling
presentation.[inaudible]

00:49:52.329 --> 00:49:59.400
[laughter]
But you can go see it on the web. It's really

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:02.140
-- these
people do amazing things. This guy for

00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:09.369
example, he had his coffee roasted in England,
all right? By some highfalutin roaster. And

00:50:09.369 --> 00:50:12.589
he wanted to figure out how many days since
the

00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:15.730
roast date would be the best date to serve
the

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:17.869
coffee. And furthermore, the competition was
in

00:50:17.869 --> 00:50:20.660
BogotÃ¡, Columbia, which is a high altitude
that

00:50:20.660 --> 00:50:26.519
changes the way the creme acts and so on.
So what he did was, he took a

00:50:26.519 --> 00:50:30.830
bunch of coffees that he got from the roaster
and he went up to a high

00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:35.480
mountain in El Salvador and he basically
prepared the coffee every day until he figured

00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:38.230
out
that two weeks from the day of roasting was

00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:40.640
the
right time for this particular bean. And so,

00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:42.190
he went to Colombia and he extended all this
and he won the

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:43.190
championship.

00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:44.190
[laughter].

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:46.989
&gt;&gt; Alon: Just amazing..

00:50:46.989 --> 00:50:52.189
&gt;&gt; Louis: How do you like to roast your
coffee?

00:50:52.189 --> 00:50:55.120
&gt;&gt; Alon: I'm waiting for your recipe, man.
I

00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:01.160
like it light. But it's actually harder to
roast light.

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:05.450
&gt;&gt; Louis: It is.
&gt;&gt;Alon: It's more brittle. So I'm waiting

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:06.869
for the -- we have -- Louis and I have the
same

00:51:06.869 --> 00:51:12.730
roasting machine. So I've gone through -- you
know, I bought an espresso machine. I bought

00:51:12.730 --> 00:51:16.190
a
roaster. Almost the entire chain of coffee

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:21.640
production is in my home except I don't grow
the coffee. Hector, a few years ago, bought

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:26.900
us a
coffee plant. On the Internet. It was

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:30.579
blossoming doing very well. It takes about
three or four years until it starts producing

00:51:30.579 --> 00:51:33.011
fruit, but
then he went to Colombia for two weeks before

00:51:33.011 --> 00:51:42.390
Christmas and it died. The water we gave it
was not the right water.

00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:47.920
&gt;&gt;Louis: I have one final question. If you
have to pick between the place that has

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:54.130
mediocre coffee but good atmosphere and culture
the other way around great coffee but some

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:55.519
nasty place?

00:51:55.519 --> 00:52:02.339
&gt;&gt; Alon: So the great coffee is not in any
nasty places. I enjoy Oslo. I enjoy, London

00:52:02.339 --> 00:52:05.710
actually
has great cafes. Melbourne is not a nasty

00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:10.660
place. Personally, I would say c'est la vie
-- that's

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:16.119
obviously because of particular. I would
not -- I don't think I could survive in Paris

00:52:16.119 --> 00:52:23.300
anymore. There are a few good cafes emerging.
Once you start getting into the coffee world,

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:26.500
actually your life becomes harder, because
you

00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:34.190
can't just walk into any cafe and have coffee.
It's -- and that's why the aeropress is getting

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:38.769
popular. Because people who care about their
coffee, they bring their hand grinders, their

00:52:38.769 --> 00:52:42.209
own beans, their aeropress. That's how they
survive trips.

00:52:42.209 --> 00:52:48.339
&gt;&gt; Male #24: So the coffee culture besides
complementary environment culture is complementary

00:52:48.339 --> 00:52:53.619
culture of bakery.
La brioche, or croissant which are very different

00:52:53.619 --> 00:52:56.769
from different
countries. From your experience which one

00:52:56.769 --> 00:52:59.559
is
the most interesting, most different.

00:52:59.559 --> 00:53:01.130
&gt;&gt; Alon: So where?

00:53:01.130 --> 00:53:04.020
&gt;&gt;Male #24: Like cultures, bakery for coffee.

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:10.170
&gt;&gt; Alon: So a lot of times good bakery
culture is, you know, makes up for bad coffee.

00:53:10.170 --> 00:53:17.809
So that's why Paris exists. That's in Vienna
you can go to places where, you know, the

00:53:17.809 --> 00:53:21.910
coffee is not great, but the pastries are
really good. I found, for example, Melbourne

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:29.010
have really nice food in cafes. There's
certain places where you really find some

00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:33.940
reasonable food.
You can sit there for longer. London -- again,

00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:37.310
the all the nice cafes in London are Australians
and

00:53:37.310 --> 00:53:44.369
Kiwis who moved to London to open cafes and
teach the Brits what to do. But then, like

00:53:44.369 --> 00:53:51.220
in
the U.S., the great cafes don't actually have

00:53:51.220 --> 00:54:00.099
food. They might have a scone.

00:54:00.099 --> 00:54:03.640
&gt;&gt; Louis: You're the envy of every Googler.

00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:04.640
[laughter].

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:05.640
&gt;&gt; Alon: Thank you very much.

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:05.641
[Applause]
