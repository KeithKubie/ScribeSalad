00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.120
Classical conditioning involves our reflexive responses, such as salivation,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.128
eye blink, and startle responses. Unconditioned stimuli automatically elicit

00:00:10.128 --> 00:00:14.720
unconditioned responses. After pairing a neutral stimulus with an unconditioned

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.273
stimulus, classical conditioning occurs. And the neutral stimulus becomes a

00:00:19.273 --> 00:00:24.258
conditioned stimulus that elicits a conditioned response. Remember Pavlov and

00:00:24.258 --> 00:00:28.845
his dogs. Operant conditioning was described by BF Skinner. And he said that we

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:32.037
operate on our environment, and behaviors are selected due to their

00:00:32.037 --> 00:00:37.096
consequences. Positive and negative reinforcement produce an increase in a

00:00:37.096 --> 00:00:42.074
future frequency of a behavior. Where as positive and negative punishment

00:00:42.074 --> 00:00:46.560
produce a decrease in the future frequency of a behavior. Unconditioned

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.585
reinforces like food, sex and water, and unconditioned punishers like pain are

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:58.192
effective with no prior learning history. However, condition reinforcers like

00:00:58.192 --> 00:01:03.043
money or grades, and condition punishers, like harsh words, are effective

00:01:03.043 --> 00:01:10.246
because of a pairing process. Social learning involves learning by watching the

00:01:10.246 --> 00:01:15.456
consequences of somebody else's behavior. If we see somebody being rewarded for

00:01:15.456 --> 00:01:20.186
doing something, we be more likely to do that as well if we want to be

00:01:20.186 --> 00:01:25.527
rewarded. Also the same is true for consequences that are negative. Remember

00:01:25.527 --> 00:01:29.643
the Bobo of our experiments, these are examples of social learning. Our

00:01:29.643 --> 00:01:34.598
learning is a function of all these processes. Classical conditioning, operant

00:01:34.598 --> 00:01:37.201
conditioning, and social learning
