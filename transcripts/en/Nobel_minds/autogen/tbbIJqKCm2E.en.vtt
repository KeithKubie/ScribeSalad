wondered if it was a prank but then I
 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.150
wondered if it was a prank but then I
knew it was the right day and it would

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160
knew it was the right day and it would
 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.400

I don't know if there's another case if

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710
I don't know if there's another case if
 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.220
I don't know if there's another case if

somebody being awarded a Nobel Prize for
 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.660
somebody being awarded a Nobel Prize for
their very first scientific paper

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670
 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.060
I sort of feel like I just lucked into

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100
experimentalist where did it come from
 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.430
experimentalist where did it come from
do you think I don't know I mean it was

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440
do you think I don't know I mean it was
 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.350
do you think I don't know I mean it was
it was just a fun thing to do and so I

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360
it was just a fun thing to do and so I
 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.510
it was just a fun thing to do and so I
enjoyed putting many hours into it yet

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520
enjoyed putting many hours into it yet
 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.830

it is the one time of my life that I
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.510
it is the one time of my life that I
worked and but you know it was a fun

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
worked and but you know it was a fun
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.430
worked and but you know it was a fun
time in the field of short pulse lasers

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440
time in the field of short pulse lasers
 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.870
time in the field of short pulse lasers
and it was a fun group to be in and

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880
and it was a fun group to be in and
 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:34.010
and it was a fun group to be in and
so you put in the long hours it's the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020
so you put in the long hours it's the
 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.020
so you put in the long hours it's the
classic vision of the experimental

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030

everybody comes tonight but I was

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090
everybody comes tonight but I was
 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.060
everybody comes tonight but I was
thinking oh I even quoted her I cited

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070
thinking oh I even quoted her I cited
 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.240
thinking oh I even quoted her I cited
her work in my thesis right that's a

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250
her work in my thesis right that's a
 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.610
her work in my thesis right that's a
nice connection what message do you

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620
nice connection what message do you
 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.350
nice connection what message do you
think it sends to people

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360
think it sends to people
 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.900
think it sends to people
I don't know how to answer that because

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910
I don't know how to answer that because
 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.030
I don't know how to answer that because
I'm not saying I'm not a woman who's

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040
I'm not saying I'm not a woman who's
 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.010
I'm not saying I'm not a woman who's
been you know looking at all of these

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020
been you know looking at all of these
 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.750
been you know looking at all of these
prices thinking why isn't there a woman

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760
prices thinking why isn't there a woman
 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.900
prices thinking why isn't there a woman
I sort of haven't thought like that but

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910
I sort of haven't thought like that but
 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.750
I sort of haven't thought like that but
I know a lot of people I guess do you

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760
I know a lot of people I guess do you
 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.260
I know a lot of people I guess do you
look at that I don't know I I hope I

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270
look at that I don't know I I hope I
 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.700
look at that I don't know I I hope I
mean I certainly tell the Maria gay

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710
mean I certainly tell the Maria gay
 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.350
mean I certainly tell the Maria gay
Britton Myers story and I'm happier that

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360
Britton Myers story and I'm happier that
 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.210
Britton Myers story and I'm happier that
life isn't like that I'm glad there were

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220
life isn't like that I'm glad there were
 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.810
life isn't like that I'm glad there were
trailblazers like ternary jury he didn't

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820
trailblazers like ternary jury he didn't
 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.580
trailblazers like ternary jury he didn't
get to have a paid job to the longest

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590
get to have a paid job to the longest
 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:37.960
get to have a paid job to the longest
time right she didn't really get to be

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970
time right she didn't really get to be
 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.840
time right she didn't really get to be
recognized as a scientist even though

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850
recognized as a scientist even though
 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.310
recognized as a scientist even though
you know she was doing incredible work

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320
you know she was doing incredible work
 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.260
you know she was doing incredible work
right I think she went hers in the

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270
right I think she went hers in the
 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.220
right I think she went hers in the
fifties he was 63 she was awarded 63 and

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230
fifties he was 63 she was awarded 63 and
 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.070
fifties he was 63 she was awarded 63 and
the work I cite for her started the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080
the work I cite for her started the
 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.540
the work I cite for her started the
whole field of multiphoton ionization

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550
whole field of multiphoton ionization
 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.210
whole field of multiphoton ionization
which was the first thing that art laser

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220
which was the first thing that art laser
 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.060
which was the first thing that art laser
was used for and in my thesis and and

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070
was used for and in my thesis and and
 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.949
was used for and in my thesis and and
that work was done in 1939

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959
that work was done in 1939
 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.360
that work was done in 1939
it's not what she won the Nobel Prize

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370
it's not what she won the Nobel Prize
 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.580
it's not what she won the Nobel Prize
for but again it totally changed what

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590
for but again it totally changed what
 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.160
for but again it totally changed what
could be done right yes and you just

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170
could be done right yes and you just
 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.620
could be done right yes and you just
think how can you go 20 more than 20

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630
think how can you go 20 more than 20
 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.380
think how can you go 20 more than 20
years you know I don't know if that was

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390
years you know I don't know if that was
 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.120
years you know I don't know if that was
that one sort of surprise not to get a

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130
that one sort of surprise not to get a
 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.860
that one sort of surprise not to get a
Nobel Prize but just to even be

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870
Nobel Prize but just to even be
 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.550
Nobel Prize but just to even be
recognized as a scientist yes so so I

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560
recognized as a scientist yes so so I
 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.170
recognized as a scientist yes so so I
think things have totally changed so I

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180
think things have totally changed so I
 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.070
think things have totally changed so I
think it will come around and change

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080
think it will come around and change
 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.410
think it will come around and change
yeah I suppose one thing that is going

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420
yeah I suppose one thing that is going
 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.490
yeah I suppose one thing that is going
to happen is that you're going to be

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500
to happen is that you're going to be
 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.020
to happen is that you're going to be
very much in demand how do you think

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030
very much in demand how do you think
 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.120
very much in demand how do you think
about that you have a little scared

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130
about that you have a little scared
 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.820
about that you have a little scared
about that because I was talking to a

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830
about that because I was talking to a
 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.100
about that because I was talking to a
previous Nobel Prize winner a few years

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110
previous Nobel Prize winner a few years
 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.680
previous Nobel Prize winner a few years
back and you know he told me how he flew

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.690
back and you know he told me how he flew
 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.140
back and you know he told me how he flew
a hundred thousand miles you know and

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150
a hundred thousand miles you know and
 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.640
a hundred thousand miles you know and
scientists don't even get to fly first

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650
scientists don't even get to fly first
 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.229
scientists don't even get to fly first
class so that's hard like a year like

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239
class so that's hard like a year like
 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:48.370
class so that's hard like a year like
you know and it's like oh my goodness

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380
you know and it's like oh my goodness
 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:04:05.620
you know and it's like oh my goodness
that's a lot yeah at this point this is

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630
that's a lot yeah at this point this is
 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.350
that's a lot yeah at this point this is
this is a pretty surprising point to be

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360
this is a pretty surprising point to be
 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.780
this is a pretty surprising point to be
at I mean for anybody it's it's a you've

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790
at I mean for anybody it's it's a you've
 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.080
at I mean for anybody it's it's a you've
only heard just a few minutes ago let me

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090
only heard just a few minutes ago let me
 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.210
only heard just a few minutes ago let me
just very briefly about ultra-fast

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220
just very briefly about ultra-fast
 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.340
just very briefly about ultra-fast
lasers what's your favorite example of

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350
lasers what's your favorite example of
 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.789
lasers what's your favorite example of
what they can do oh okay well right
