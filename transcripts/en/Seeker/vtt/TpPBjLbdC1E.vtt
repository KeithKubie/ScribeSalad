00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.320
He may look sad to see you go but I'm sorry
to say, when you leave the house… two minutes

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:19.300
later, your dog forgot that you were even
there.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.290
Before we get into animal memory, make sure
you stay to the end of the video for a HUGE

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.290
announcement…

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.430
So, an elephant NEVER forgets.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.430
Flipper!

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.790
No one you see, is smarter than he!

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.540
My dogs and cats miss me when I'm not there...

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.399
We are constantly personifying the smarts
of our animal friends, but how would you actually

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:37.399
TEST this?

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.460
In a 2014 issue of Behavioural Processes,
a researcher from Stockholm University tried

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.500
to do just that.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.790
Using delayed matching-to-sample training,
researchers tested the memory retention of

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.670
25 species including chimpanzees, dolphins,
seals, crows, dogs, rats, macaques, capuchins,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.020
pigeons, chickens, and bees.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.010
They trained each animal to look at a colored
light and then presented them with a choice

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.370
of two lights later.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.950
If the animal "remembered" the correct light
they were rewarded!

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.650
In this way, they could test over and over
again and see how long an animal could remember

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.210
which one they'd seen first.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.200
Rats performed the best when there was no
delay at all, but dogs were the best as the

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.200
delay increased!

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.219
But don't get too excited.

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:20.670
It turns out, dogs have an arbitrary short-term
memory of a little over two minutes and our

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:31.649
genetic cousin the chimpanzee was completely
average at around a minute.

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:38.259
Humans, for comparison can easily complete
this task 48 hours later.

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.850
The thing, is memory is really… uh… what's
the word?

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.290
DIFFICULT to test.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.279
The researchers acknowledge this only really
tests arbitrary short term memory.

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:53.200
Dolphins, who scored second, have been documented
to recall the whistles of their friends even

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.020
20 years later.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.490
Elephants can remember trauma, family members
and friends over long periods as well.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.969
So does my dog REALLY forget me?

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:04.969
Not REALLY.

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:10.640
This research shows that humans have a VERY
adept arbitrary memory.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.160
Matching a colored light doesn't really affect
your survival, and yet for some reason, our

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.270
brain chooses to store the information.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.000
Animals likely don't do that.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.110
Where humans use episodic memory -- as in
we understand what's happened, what's happening

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.330
now and what WILL happen in time -- animals
learn behaviorally.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:36.080
A dog knows it's time to eat, because it can
sense how hungry it is, and on average, it's

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.300
been trained to receive food before work and
after.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.610
These and other researchers believe animals
have an inferred memory; remembering things

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.110
that are relevant to their survival.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.810
For example, a cat remembers where its food
is when you go away for the weekend, but it

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.660
probably doesn't really know exactly how long
you've been gone.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.760
A cheetah may remember it had a kill this
morning because he's still full of food, or

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.290
which female it mated with because its brain
imprinted her scent so he spreads his genes

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.410
further, but he likely WON'T remember if it
rained last week.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.010
In the 1950s Psychologist George Miller determined
humans can store seven "chunks" of information

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.210
in or short term memory; give or take.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.490
But the problem is, the more we really dig
into how memory works the more nebulous is

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.490
becomes.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:26.380
Testing covert behavior -- or behavior we
can't externally observe, is very problematic,

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.700
because we can't see inside their heads or
ask them what they're thinking.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.070
In the end, take any study like this with
a grain of salt, even the researchers say

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.700
this is just one measure of memory.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.200
So while your scent is probably imprinted
on your pet as a member of its pack or family,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.570
it doesn't remember that birthday card you
bought her last year.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.960
Instead, your pet is more concerned with things
related to survival than the arbitrary joys

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.420
you personify, but that doesn't mean they
don't care!

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.600
They just care differently than we do.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.000
Now, that announcement I mentioned...

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.120
I'm really excited to announce the launch
of our brand new sister show Seeker!

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.690
We take a science approach to the news, and
they take a look at the more human side...Like

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:22.700
in this video here is about risky oil exploration
in the Arctic!

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:23.700
Seriously!

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:34.390
It’s a 
fantastic brand spanking new show and I know

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:35.390
you're going to love it.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.510
Evan and Lissette are the best.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:43.440
So go click the first link in the description
and check it out!

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.660
Thanks.
