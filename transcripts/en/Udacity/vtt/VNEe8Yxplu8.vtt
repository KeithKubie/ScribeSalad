00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.550
Another thing you can look at
is the Sales Performance Report.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:11.085
You go to Conversions,
e-commerce, Sales Performance.

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:14.400
In this report,
groups results by transaction.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.050
You can drill down into a transaction

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.400
to see what the products
included in the transaction.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.660
Here I've only got one
product per transaction,

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.510
because our app assumes that the current
dinner is the only product in the cart.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.110
But here's an example from a different
app with more transactions, so

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.610
drill down into this transaction ID.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.300
And you see that the customer
bought several things in a single

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.390
purchase transaction.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.100
And the revenue for the transaction
is the sum of the prices for

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.790
the products included
in the transaction.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.310
In this transaction, the customer
bought several different shirts.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:53.030
So the total revenue is the sum
of the cost of all of the shirts.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.240
That's a lot of shirts for one person.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.199
I hope they all fit.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.600
So far in our app,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.610
when the user hits the purchase button,
they buy the currently selected dinner.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.230
And they pretty much have
no choice about that.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.800
But usually customers like to
buy things by the cartload,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.580
rather than selecting and
paying for items one by one.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.650
So to tell analytics that
the user bought multiple products

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.340
in a single transaction,

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.090
you just add whatever products you need
to the hit to be sent to analytics.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.170
Create a product object for

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.220
each product in the cart, set the name,
set all the other details and so on.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.160
Then you create the product action,
you set the action to ACTION_PURCHASE.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.830
Set the TransactionId and then you can
optionally set a ProductActionList,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.250
if you want to group all
the products into a list.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.060
You don't have to do that though.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.080
And then you get the tracker, as before.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.190
And you add each of
the products to the tracker and

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.530
then you build and send the hit.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.470
And this is pretty much the code that
you've already learned how to write.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.010
The only difference, really,
is that you can add multiple products.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.370
Now I know some people say it's not
polite to talk about money in public,

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.970
but I really do want to bring up
a couple of matters to do with money.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.540
Every product has its own price.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.040
This shirt costs 10.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.040
And when you send an action
purchase hit to analytics,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.950
the total price of the transaction
is automatically calculated

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.760
from the price and the quantity of
the products in the transaction.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.900
That's cool, right?

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.730
Kind of what you'd expect, sure is.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.220
But if you take a look at the API
reference for product action,

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.680
you'll see there are methods for setting
the revenue, the tax and the shipping.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.570
If the tax and
the shipping are relevant,

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.280
you'll need to write the code
to add them to the transaction.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.220
Remember I said that you can
set the name of the list

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.850
that's associated with
a given set of products?

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.180
If applicable, by setting the
ProductActionList on the ProductAction.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.290
The list name shows up on
the product list performance page.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.540
And in this case there
is two product lists,

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.010
one without a name, and
the other one is all the things.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.730
And then if you drill
down into all the things,

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.910
you see the products that
were in the product list, and

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.290
you can find out what they contributed
to the product revenue for the list.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.660
I don't have a coding exercise for
you related to calculating taxes or

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.980
setting product lists, but
feel free to explore on your own.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.680
Up next though, you do have a quiz.
