00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.380
Unless there is a lead-lined refrigerator
lying around, we’re guessing none of you

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.630
reading this would be too keen on standing
at ground zero of a nuclear blast.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.660
But it turns out this is exactly what six
men chose to do with their afternoon in July

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.910
of 1957- five of them even volunteered, with
the sixth not told what he’d be ordered

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.500
to do that day until he showed up to work…

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.540
So who were these men, why were they there,
and what happened after?

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.190
As the Cold War began heating up and the U.S.
and Soviets were each attempting to set a

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.800
record for money spent stock piling thousands
of weapons not intended to be used, the general

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.989
public were getting a little nervous about
both the testing of said weapons and what

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.130
would happen if one of the two super powers
decided to take things to the next level,

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.400
particularly as rockets and missiles tipped
with nukes started to become a thing.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.220
Despite assertions that there was nothing
inherently dangerous about a rocket with a

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.369
nuclear warhead detonating directly above
you, the citizens of the United States weren’t

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.369
buying it.

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.590
Putting their money where their mouths were,
Colonel Arthur Oldfield of the Continental

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.990
Air Defense Command decided to prove the assertion,
ordering to have just this sort of thing filmed

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.990
happening.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.090
This particular test, named John, was a part
of the five month long Operation Plumbbob

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.159
series of nuclear tests.

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.939
Besides the men involved with John, these
tests also included over 18,000 other members

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.640
of the military being put in relatively close
proximity to nuclear blasts, with the point

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.880
being to determine how troops would react
in battle with nukes detonating nearby.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.780
The tests also included over a thousand pigs
being used to study the biological effects

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.210
of the detonations when the subjects were
much closer to the blasts than officials were

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.550
comfortable putting humans.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:11.790
(Squeal piggy!!!)

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:22.959
The

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:28.030
five men who volunteered to insert themselves
into John were Colonel Sidney Bruce, Lt. Colonel

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.560
Frank P. Ball, Major Norman “Bodie” Bodinger,
Major John Hughes, and Colonel Donald Lutrell.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.960
The sixth individual was a cameraman named
Akira “George” Yoshitake- simultaneously

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.440
the only one who did not volunteer for the
gig and the only one who had a job to do during

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.440
the blast.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.160
His job, of course, was to capture the entire
event for a nice little propaganda film to

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.310
demonstrate that these nuclear tipped rockets
were perfectly safe to use in air combat scenarios

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.380
above populated regions.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:05.019
And so it was that on July 19, 1957, the five
exceptionally brave men and one cameraman,

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.859
no doubt re-evaluating his career choices
and decision making paradigm, found themselves

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:15.489
standing around 70 miles northwest of Las
Vegas as the crow flies, or about 100 miles

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.870
by road, in the Yucca Flats in the Area 10
Test Site.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.850
Next to them was a sign that read “Ground
Zero.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.780
Population 5”, casually disregarding the
key contributions of Yoshitake, which has

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:32.020
been a theme for the few hundred filmmakers
who were so critical to these nuclear tests

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.449
and data gathering, yet have been largely
ignored by history.

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:42.090
Soon enough an F-28 jet flew overhead, shooting
a Genie rocket equipped with a 1.5 kiloton

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.180
W25 nuclear warhead.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.260
This was actually the first test of a live
nuclear tipped Genie rocket, but, thankfully

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.040
for the men, the unguided rocket did not malfunction
and instead flew straight for about two and

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.979
a half miles at a height of around Flight
Level 180 (about 18,000 feet or about 5.5

00:03:55.979 --> 00:03:56.979
km).

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:57.979
It then detonated almost directly above them.

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:58.979
Said Major Bodey as it happened, “We felt
a heat pulse.

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:59.979
A very bright light.

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:00.979
A fireball it is red.

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:01.979
The sky looks black about it.

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:02.979
It is boiling above us.

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:03.979
It is rapidly losing its color…”

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:04.979
Then a massive blast sound could be heard,
at which point Bodey stated, “There is the

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:05.979
ground wave!

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:06.979
It is over folks, It happened!

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:07.979
The mounds are vibrating.

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:08.979
It is tremendous!

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:09.979
Directly above our heads!

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:10.979
It is a huge fireball.

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:33.330
… Wasn’t that a perfect, perfect shot.”

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.270
Seemingly remembering the whole thing was
to be a propaganda film showing it was just

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:44.560
good family fun to stand under a nuclear blast,
Colonel Bruce then stated, “My only regrets

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.229
right now are that everyone couldn’t have
been out here at ground zero with us.”

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.610
Shortly thereafter he no doubt thanked the
Academy and noted he felt humbled to be there.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.240
You might at this point be thinking that while
the blast itself didn’t do them any harm,

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.460
other than maybe a stubborn case of tinnitus-
the little talked about silent killer associated

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.300
with nuclear blasts- surely these men must
have been exposed to copious amounts of ionizing

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.300
radiation.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.121
But this turns out not to have been the case.

00:05:09.121 --> 00:05:13.050
It was later determined they were exposed
to negligible amounts of such radiation.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.840
In fact, less than the pilot of the F-89 jet
and significantly less than the pilots ordered

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.669
to fly through the region of atmosphere the
blast occurred at a mere ten minutes later.

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.650
The blast occurring reasonably high in the
atmosphere also ensured that no ground materials

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.620
were sucked up, thus no large cloud of radioactive
particles was present.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.040
And as for the radioactive materials from
the bomb and any dust already in the atmosphere

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.110
nearby, these would have spread out quite
widely before coming down.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.560
Ironically, however, while the whole thing
was meant to show the safety of such nuclear

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.760
rockets detonating high over head, radioactive
particles from these tests frequently settled

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.360
on nearby towns, even as far away as Utah.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.409
As you might expect from this, the U.S. government
has paid a pretty penny, to the tune of around

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:01.460
a billion dollars to date, to the inhabitants
of these regions who later had health problems

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.280
possibly related to being exposed to high
amounts of ionizing radiation during the tests.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.039
All this said, it is noted that every one
of these six brave men did later in life get

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.000
cancer at one point or another.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.879
However, it’s not thought this test in particularly
probably contributed much to that.

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:22.400
All of them were involved in a number of nuclear
tests, many of which saw them exposed to far

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.210
more ionizing radiation, with the cumulative
effect of it all probably also not helping

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.210
matters.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.590
In the end, Major Hughes lived to the age
of 71, dying of cancer in 1990.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.780
Lt. Col. Ball lived until 2003, dying at the
ripe old age of 83 of cancer.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:42.400
Colonel Bruce actually made it to 86, dying
in 2005 of, you guessed it, cancer.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:47.229
Major Bodinger also died of cancer, we believe
in February of 1997, though it’s not clear

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:51.850
here as his grave is not listed in the U.S.
Department of Veteran Affairs grave site locator.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.710
But we found a grave in Oklahoma for someone
that appears to match up with what we know

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:56.710
about Bodie.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.460
Next up, Colonel Lutrell at one point got
colon cancer, though it isn’t clear whether

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:01.669
this is what he died of.

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:06.400
Whatever the case, he seems to have shuffled
off this mortal coil in 2014 at the age of

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.400
91.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.810
As for the cameraman George Yoshitake, while
he did have to battle stomach cancer to do

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:44.110
it, he lived to 84, dying

00:07:44.110 --> 00:08:14.240
in 2013 of

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:22.090
a stroke.
