00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.719
In fact, it's been shown that
if you increase the supply of

00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:06.520
primary care physicians by just 1 for

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.650
every 10,000 people, there's
a significant increase in quality, and

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.090
a significant decrease in the cost
of Medicare, which you may remember,

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.150
takes care of older people who are more
likely to have chronic disease.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.480
Conversely, if there's a similar
decrease in the availability of primary

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.190
care physicians, there's an almost
equal decrease in quality.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.410
And a nearly equal increase
in the cost of Medicare.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.510
You may be asking why?

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.850
Well, one of the major reasons
is that specialists charge more.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.345
And they do far more tests and
procedures.

00:00:43.345 --> 00:00:48.080
Moreover, how do they
coordinate their care?

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.140
How does each of these specialists, and

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.100
remember Marla may not even see
the same cardiologist every time she

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.170
visits that office,
know what all of the others are doing.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.140
In particular, how do each of these
specialists know what medications

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.660
all of the others have prescribed?

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.110
This is important, because the same
research that showed Marla

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.260
will likely see 14 providers each year,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.210
also showed she would likely fill
50 prescriptions that same year.
