00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.265
BORIS: We're ready
to start here.

00:00:04.265 --> 00:00:05.848
MALE SPEAKER: Yep,
go ahead and start.

00:00:05.848 --> 00:00:07.030
It's been recording.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.180
BORIS: OK, great.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.290
So welcome everybody.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.820
This is a small NASA
Ames SETI Institute

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.780
talk we have here today.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.750
Chris McKay pinged me over
email a couple of weeks

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.160
ago regarding this topic,
and I think it's worthwhile.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.790
So I'm going to let Chris
introduce Dale Anderson, who

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.900
by the way is one of the oldest
bloggers on the internet.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.760
You'll hear about that.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.570
Give a warm welcome
to both of them.

00:00:43.497 --> 00:00:44.580
CHRIS MCKAY: Thanks Boris.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.870
As Boris said, I'm at Ames
just across the creek.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.260
You guys are engulfing us.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.950
You may have noticed that.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.580
And we're involved
in planetary science,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.140
exploring other worlds.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.410
And one of the ways we
do that is exploring

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.930
places on Earth
that are analogs.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.470
And Dale has been one
of the leaders in that.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.760
In particular the
application to Antarctica,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.670
and diving in lakes, ice
covered lakes in Antarctica.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.430
And he'll talk about
how that connects.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.870
And we use a variety of
Google tools in what we do,

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.630
and mapping out what we're
doing, and researching.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.620
Boris and I have had a
longstanding interaction

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.470
on shared interests ranging from
rovers to desert environments.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.929
And two months ago,
three months ago,

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:32.720
Boris pinged me and
said, what are you guys

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.250
doing in Antarctica?

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.780
So that was the genesis of this.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.790
Dale is actually
located in New York.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:39.670
He's here for a week.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.501
And so this was an opportunity
to come and sort of talk

00:01:44.501 --> 00:01:46.000
a little bit about
what we're doing.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.147
So Dale.

00:01:47.147 --> 00:01:48.313
DALE ANDERSON: Thanks Chirs.

00:01:48.313 --> 00:01:48.854
Thanks Boris.

00:01:48.854 --> 00:01:50.960
Boris I'll probably
need a little help

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.270
getting this going again.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.350
So I need to connect this
window back up right.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.430
So back up here to Screen Share.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.830
Screen Share, Desktop.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.077
Yeah.

00:02:03.077 --> 00:02:04.660
BORIS: That's where
we see the slides.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.042
DALE ANDERSON: OK, where
has the application gone?

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.646
OK, we're good to go?

00:02:24.646 --> 00:02:25.925
OK, great.

00:02:25.925 --> 00:02:27.514
Well, thanks everybody
for showing up.

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:28.180
I appreciate it.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.329
And what I want to do is
just by quick introduction

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.120
I am Dale Anderson.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.245
I work over at the SETI
Institute at the Carl Sagan

00:02:34.245 --> 00:02:35.040
Center.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.280
And I do look at life
in extreme environments,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.900
and I'll take you on a journey
to see some of those areas.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.080
Again, basically at
the SETI Institute

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.420
we're interested in the
field of astrobiology,

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.590
and these bigger questions
of how did we get here,

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.510
where are we going,
and are we alone?

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.880
Are there microbial
ecosystems out in the universe

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.720
besides the ones we
find on Earth, or even

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.230
perhaps intelligent life that
we can hear through the radio

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.930
signals or other means?

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.410
And then we have
quite a few people

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.386
that work in a whole
slew of different areas.

00:03:08.386 --> 00:03:10.010
It's a very
multi-disciplinary approach

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.384
to understanding the origins,
evolution, and distribution

00:03:12.384 --> 00:03:13.740
of life in the universe.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.700
So we're interested
in following the birth

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.010
of the biogenic
elements in the stars

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.280
all the way up through the
evolution of advanced life.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.480
And so we have to have knowledge
of both things out in space,

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.670
and in particular we need
to have those lessons

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.910
that we learned here on Earth.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.620
And of course, for us
right now, since we're not

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.170
going to be able to get
out beyond the solar system

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.230
anytime soon we're most
interested in trying

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.640
to find life here in our own
neighborhood, places like Mars,

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.630
and some of the outer moons
or outer planetary moons

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.330
like Europa,
Enceladus, and Titan.

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.430
So a little bit about me
and how I got to where I am.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.190
I've been working in remote
environments like this

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:58.430
since I was 22.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.316
And that was back
in 1978, so I've

00:04:00.316 --> 00:04:02.030
been doing this for
a pretty good while.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.130
I've got about 17
seasons in Antarctica,

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.020
60 plus months camped out
in these areas over my life.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.280
Another 30 field seasons or
so up north, with another 30

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.087
months up there.

00:04:13.087 --> 00:04:15.170
So I've spent a lot of
time sleeping in the rocks,

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.209
and have gotten pretty
comfortable at it,

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.769
and really enjoy doing
that kind of work.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.222
And I've been able
over the years

00:04:22.222 --> 00:04:23.680
to help develop a
lot of techniques

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.469
that we use to work
in these environments,

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:27.260
particularly the diving
under the thick ice

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.840
and putting the methods
together for studying

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.730
those environments.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.220
And that's what I'm going to
talk about a little bit today.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.320
Let's see.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.483
So I can't really point to
this very easily, can I?

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.205
OK.

00:04:43.205 --> 00:04:44.955
So here's the map of
Antarctica, and we're

00:04:44.955 --> 00:04:47.210
going to go to basically
two different areas.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.720
I've had the
privilege of working

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.659
in three major areas
of the Antarctic.

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:52.200
Down in the bottom
part of the screen

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.430
you'll see McMurdo
Sound, and that's

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.050
where the US Antarctic program
and the New Zealand programs

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.680
have their biggest research
programs going, right

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.140
around Ross Island and
the McMurdo Dry Valleys.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.600
Also I've worked over in the
Bunger Hills, which is over

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.080
on the right hand
side of the screen.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.170
This is another ice free area.

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:16.070
Back in 1991, '92, I was
part of a joint expedition

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.090
between the Soviet space program
and the US space program.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.080
We spent about six and
a half, seven months

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.797
traversing around the Antarctic
continent by ice breaker,

00:05:23.797 --> 00:05:26.213
and then getting dropped off
in the Bunger Hills for four,

00:05:26.213 --> 00:05:28.014
four and a half months.

00:05:28.014 --> 00:05:29.555
It was almost like
a Mars simulation.

00:05:29.555 --> 00:05:33.650
You know, have an international
group of researchers,

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.620
mostly Russian and
American, one Canadian,

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.300
live together and work
together, and get over

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.841
those cultural difficulties
and language barriers just

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:44.090
as you would if you were on
Mars for a period of about

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.740
three years.

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.870
Really kind of a trip.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.090
So this was a great expedition
to do exobiology work

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.190
with out Soviet counterparts.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.960
More recently I've started
working with Chris and Alfonso.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.640
Up in the top part
of the screen you'll

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.080
see that where the arrow is
going up to Lake Untersee,

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.610
this is down below South Africa.

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.820
There's an area there called
the Schirmacher Oasis.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.660
And then you go further inland
and you'll hit some mountains.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.797
And this is where the lake
that we're studying is located.

00:06:09.797 --> 00:06:12.130
But I want to start this off
in the McMurdo Dry Valleys.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.550
This is down in the Ross Island
region, south of New Zealand,

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.769
and this is were I cut my teeth
in the Antarctic back in 1978

00:06:19.769 --> 00:06:20.810
starting as an undergrad.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:25.540
Let me just back this up.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.590
So the McMurdo Dry Valleys
are the largest ice free area

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.040
in the Antarctic continent.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.900
It's only about 1% of the
continent is actually ice free.

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:35.040
So it's a very rare
type of environment.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.060
It's a very cold, dry place.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.600
And it's probably the
best terrestrial analog

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.080
that we have on
the planet to Mars.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.530
And that's one of the things
that has drawn researchers

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.890
there, even from
the early 1960s.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.810
JPL and Ames both had
researchers going down there

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.966
to prepare for the Viking
Program for example.

00:06:54.966 --> 00:06:56.340
These were cold
deserts that they

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.980
wanted to understand how to look
for microbiology at the time.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.790
So if you look very
closely in these values

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:03.373
you'll see next to
the glaciers you'll

00:07:03.373 --> 00:07:05.680
see some ice covered bodies.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.844
And those are small
lakes in the valleys.

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.260
And that's where
we're going to be

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:11.650
doing some of our work
in a little while.

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.420
Back in 1977 George
Simmons, who's

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.950
standing above me
while I'm getting

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.440
ready to jump in to
Lake Bonney here,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.010
asked this very interesting
and important question

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.879
when he got out to these lakes.

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:26.920
Traditionally people had
only drilled small holes

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.378
through the thick
ice covers, cause

00:07:28.378 --> 00:07:31.410
the ice covers are anywhere from
3 and 1/2 to 6 meters thick.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:32.910
So that's a lot of
ice that you have

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.957
to go through to
get to the water.

00:07:34.957 --> 00:07:36.540
Traditionally people
had drilled holes

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.550
through those with a
small jiffy drill, which

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:44.220
is a 20 centimeter, ten
inch bit to get through,

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.330
but nobody ever looked at
the bottom of the lakes.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.040
Most of the work was done
in the water columns looking

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.850
at the phytoplankton and things
that are growing in the water.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.892
But nobody actually
asked the question

00:07:52.892 --> 00:07:54.100
what's growing on the bottom?

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.920
Most people thought
probably nothing,

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.360
we'll probably just find
rocks, because light

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.570
is going to be a limiter.

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.834
The light has to
penetrate through the ice

00:08:01.834 --> 00:08:04.000
and go down to the bottom
to support photosynthesis,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.780
and most people thought that
the light levels were just

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.270
going to be simply too low.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.410
Simmons asked that
question, and it's funny

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.310
because back in
those days we didn't

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.199
have cameras the
size of my thumb

00:08:14.199 --> 00:08:15.990
like we do now that we
could just drop down

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.198
that little jiffy drill hole.

00:08:17.198 --> 00:08:20.420
It was easier to take a
student, or somebody like George

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.300
or myself, and drop
us down a bigger hole.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.292
And that's what we did.

00:08:24.292 --> 00:08:26.500
So this is going to be a
little bit about that story,

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.080
how we got out there, and how we
started working in those lakes.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.730
And the biggest
single problem that we

00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:33.490
faced that first
year was how do you

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:38.830
get through six meters of ice
to study those ecosystems.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.576
Now out in McMurdo Sound people
had been diving in the ocean

00:08:41.576 --> 00:08:43.159
there for years, and
years, and years.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:44.650
And this is actually
my favorite place

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:45.880
on the planet to go swimming.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.040
The Antarctic ocean is
just stunningly beautiful

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.610
underwater.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.230
And I've had the opportunity
to spend quite a bit of time

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:55.300
under the ice in McMurdo Sound,
and I would be there right now

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.140
doing it if I could.

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.050
It's just that great of a place.

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.450
It's easy to make a
dive hole in McMurdo.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.060
You just take a
big track vehicle

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:04.820
out to where you
want to put the hole,

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:06.950
and this hydraulic
drill just pops up,

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.960
and it's got a 1 and 1/2
meter diameter bit on it,

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:14.441
you just pop it
over, and take off,

00:09:14.441 --> 00:09:16.690
and about a half hour later
you've got a hole drilled,

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.580
and then you just
clear the ice out.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:20.500
And then you can even
pull a little hut

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.602
over the top with
a heater inside.

00:09:22.602 --> 00:09:24.060
You've got this
nice house that you

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:26.268
can sit in, get all your
dive gear on and everything,

00:09:26.268 --> 00:09:27.230
and then go swimming.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:28.813
The only thing you
have to do is share

00:09:28.813 --> 00:09:30.890
the dive hole
occasionally with seals.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:31.990
And of course that's
one of those things

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:33.960
that you have to be careful
about because there's not

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.376
a lot of room in a dive hole,
and if you've got to get out

00:09:36.376 --> 00:09:38.980
and the seal's there
that can be a problem.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.720
But it is an incredibly
gorgeous place underwater.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.680
I just through love it.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:49.359
It's filled with life, and the
lighting is just beautiful,

00:09:49.359 --> 00:09:51.400
and there's ice, anchor
ice, all over the bottom.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.170
There's frazil ice underneath
the sea ice itself.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.670
It's one of those
things that if you

00:09:56.670 --> 00:10:00.830
get to watch some of the
videos that are online

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:05.132
and on BBC right now you should
definitely do it if you can.

00:10:05.132 --> 00:10:08.090
Now, back in the early '90s
we had a Telepresent Rover

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:09.660
that we were using.

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.970
We actually had this Rover
connected back to NASA Ames

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.480
by satellite so that we could
control it through Ames so they

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.890
could make virtual
dives with me.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:20.660
So Butler Hine and several
others, Michael Sims,

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.630
over at Ames would actually
go swimming with me

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:23.963
while they were in their office.

00:10:23.963 --> 00:10:28.090
And I would be 11, 12,000
miles away underwater

00:10:28.090 --> 00:10:29.290
underneath the ice.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:32.140
And we also had the opportunity
to turn that episode

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:36.030
into an EPO opportunity.

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:40.270
And we had students in
California, Hawaii and Virginia

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.980
also drive this vehicle and take
virtual dives with me as well.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.960
So this was in November
of 1993, and at that time

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:51.680
I was actually pulling together
a little program called

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.475
Dale's Dive Diary.

00:10:52.475 --> 00:10:56.400
And we were pumping this up
through Quest here at NASA Ames

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.960
on to the very, very
new web at the time.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.230
So we've been kind to
actively involved in trying

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:06.962
to blog and get our stories
out since the first time

00:11:06.962 --> 00:11:08.170
that we could actually do it.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:11.480
And this was actually the first
time any broadcast like this

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.137
had been made from
the Antarctic.

00:11:14.137 --> 00:11:15.970
So we're going to go
to the Dry Valleys now.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.020
This is Taylor Valley.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.720
You're looking at
Lake Bonney here.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:23.290
And that's the Taylor Glacier at
the bottom part of the screen.

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:25.505
And that's looking out
towards Ross Island,

00:11:25.505 --> 00:11:27.005
and in the very,
very background you

00:11:27.005 --> 00:11:30.750
can see the volcano popping
up as the island warms around

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:33.820
where McMurdo's at.

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:35.440
This is a typical
campsite for us.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.010
This is where Alfonso, Chris,
and I stayed a few years ago

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.831
in 2009, 2010, in Pearse Valley.

00:11:41.831 --> 00:11:43.330
And again, it's one
of the most Mars

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:44.870
like environments on the planet.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.630
It's a very, very
dry, cold desert.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.529
And just off to the
left there's a lake,

00:11:49.529 --> 00:11:51.070
and this is the
surface of that lake.

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.310
This is Lake Joyce.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:54.660
And it has about six
meters of ice on top of it.

00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.500
It's very rugged surface.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:58.560
And we kept our
camp up on the top,

00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:01.260
but we kept a working
cam down on the ice.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:05.530
And here you can see a dive hut
to the left and a science tent

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:10.229
on the right, and the tripod is
right where the dive hole is.

00:12:10.229 --> 00:12:12.020
But first we have to
make some small holes.

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.440
And this is how we make those
small jiffy drill holes.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.023
And this is the same
thing that people

00:12:16.023 --> 00:12:20.710
would use for ice fishing
in standard temperate lakes

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:22.830
during the winter
time, but we end up

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.144
with a lot more bit
on the top of it.

00:12:25.144 --> 00:12:27.560
So that makes it pretty easy
getting in those small holes,

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.100
but then that came
to the problem of OK,

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.400
how do you make a bigger hole?

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.390
And traditionally chainsaws
had been used to cut out ice.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.920
But you know, you can't do
that through six meters,

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.204
which is 20 feet of ice.

00:12:37.204 --> 00:12:39.370
You'd have to start the
hole out really, really wide

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.090
and then work your way
down to the bottom.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:42.550
Finally, somebody would have
to get down to the bottom

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:44.133
and chop that piece
out, and that just

00:12:44.133 --> 00:12:45.650
didn't seem like
a very good idea.

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.930
And it had to be moving
a lot of ice to do that.

00:12:47.930 --> 00:12:51.280
So we came up with a
pretty elegant solution.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:54.660
We took some copper
tubing and formed it

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:57.274
into a coil, like a hot plate.

00:12:57.274 --> 00:12:59.190
Well, actually I'll show
you that in a second.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:03.870
But we use a steam cleaner to
heat the water up and circulate

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:04.370
it.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:07.390
This is a standard, off the
shelf, Hotsy steam cleaner.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:09.350
You can see it's been
modified a little bit.

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:10.766
The hooks and
everything on it are

00:13:10.766 --> 00:13:13.180
so we can transfer
it by helicopter.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.170
But then we have a
coil that we just

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.730
pass that hot fluid through.

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.360
We lay that down onto
the ice and let it melt.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.860
And we have a little pump on
their to pump some of the water

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.318
off so that we keep most of
that heat being driven straight

00:13:24.318 --> 00:13:26.840
into the ice as it's going down.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.270
Now, sometimes we can't
use the copper coil,

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:30.790
so we have to use
a long cylinder.

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:33.310
And here we just drill a
jiffy drill hole all the way

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.750
through the ice, and we
lower this copper tubing

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.450
that you see here down
just below the ice level,

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:42.590
and then as it heats up it
convects the heat upward,

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:45.771
and it enlarges that jiffy
drill hole over time,

00:13:45.771 --> 00:13:47.770
and it just gets bigger,
and bigger, and bigger.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:50.940
There's pluses and minuses
to using both ways.

00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.330
The nice thing about
using the flat coil

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.580
is you've got a dry hole, and
you can go down into the ice

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:59.050
as it's melting, which
is pretty phenomenal.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:03.500
When you take a trip
down into that ice,

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.910
that ice is usually
about 10 years

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.500
for it to form at the bottom
and sublimate off the top

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.220
and turn over.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:14.040
So it's a nice 10-year-old
voyage back in time

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:15.220
through the ice cover.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:16.553
And you can do the stratigraphy.

00:14:16.553 --> 00:14:18.030
You can take samples.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:21.000
And it's a great place
to finally just catch up

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.520
on the news.

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.637
You know this is kind of
a slow time for the work.

00:14:23.637 --> 00:14:25.720
You're just sitting there
watching and babysitting

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.120
the melter.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.807
Or if it gets cold outside
and the wind starts blowing,

00:14:29.807 --> 00:14:31.390
you can actually get
down in the hole,

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.690
and get on the copper
coil, and just enjoy

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.220
the warmth, which
is kind of nice.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.720
But eventually you have
to get in the water.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.750
Now, this was
going back to 1978.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.049
And this was at a time
when we were still

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:45.840
trying to figure a lot
of these things out,

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.890
and a lot of the
technology for diving

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.400
hadn't caught up to
where it is today.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.650
So we were still using
wetsuits at the time.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:56.700
This was in November, in
Taylor Valley at [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.220
The outside temperatures were
probably minus 15 or minus 20.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:01.890
It was probably a
windy day, like normal.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:04.634
And we had just a
couple of small tents .

00:15:04.634 --> 00:15:06.300
The tent on the right
was a tent that we

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:08.870
were sleeping in, eating
in, and diving out of.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.910
And of course we
would have to walk out

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.710
onto the ice over to the dive
hole after we were outside,

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.418
taken all of our
clothes off, and getting

00:15:15.418 --> 00:15:18.990
into these really thick
wetsuits, which was not easy.

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.130
Actually getting in to
the wetsuits and diving

00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:22.230
wasn't so bad.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.200
It was actually getting out
of the dive hole, getting out

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.290
onto the surface in
minus 20, and then

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:29.960
having the suit freeze up, and
then having to take it off.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:33.330
That was actually the problem
with the diving at that point.

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:36.250
So here you can see
me as a youngster.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:38.700
I was 22 years old
I started this.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.330
And we were using double
hose regulators, which people

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.280
don't tend to see
very often anymore.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.650
We were still using some
old buoy finzy buoyancy

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:48.922
compensators, and some
standard masks and things.

00:15:48.922 --> 00:15:50.130
And of course we're tethered.

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:53.790
We've got a nylon line tied to
us and we were on rope signals.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:55.929
That's one important
safety element here

00:15:55.929 --> 00:15:58.220
is when you dive in these
lakes you have to be tethered

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.670
or you don't get
back to the hole.

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.647
But this is how
we changed things.

00:16:02.647 --> 00:16:04.980
A couple years later Doc
Simmons finally got some money,

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:06.188
and we bought some dry suits.

00:16:06.188 --> 00:16:08.200
These were really
quite nice to have.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.452
These were Poseidon
uni-suits at the time .

00:16:11.452 --> 00:16:13.160
And we also went over
to full face masks.

00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.690
These are Kirby Morgan
KMB 10 full face

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:18.039
masks that have
communications inside,

00:16:18.039 --> 00:16:20.580
and we'd wear them in sort of
a bailout mode most of the time

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.760
those years, or we had a
tank attached to our back,

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:25.820
and we just breathed in
regular like regular scuba.

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.060
And here you can see
me getting pulled out

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.730
kind of in that configuration.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:31.920
Now, this is a leap
of another 10 years.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.450
This is in the early '90s.

00:16:33.450 --> 00:16:35.620
And we started switching
over to newer face

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.069
masks that are lighter weight.

00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:38.860
And I'm still using
the same mask actually.

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.020
It's an Exo 26 by DSI.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:47.940
And we've moved over to probably
more comfortable and easier

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:51.020
to use dry suits like the Dewey
suits that are available now.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.300
This is a CF 200, since I've
got on a pair of twin 70's

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.942
for tanks, and again, you
can see a communication line

00:16:57.942 --> 00:16:59.650
coming down to me
which, is also my guide

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:01.400
to get in and out of
the water, and allows

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.170
me to communicate
to the surface.

00:17:04.170 --> 00:17:07.240
In recent years probably one of
the best things that's happened

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.339
is now we have these dry gloves.

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:11.800
And dry gloves really
make our ability

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.240
to function underwater
a lot nicer.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.040
Because that's still the one
thing that we can't really

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.694
control very well is
losing heat from our hands.

00:17:20.694 --> 00:17:22.860
Most the time in the dry
suits all the way back even

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:25.300
in the wetsuits back
late '70s I was never

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:27.740
really cold underwater,
but your hands

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.744
would get cold, especially
when we had the wet mitts on.

00:17:30.744 --> 00:17:32.660
But with the advent of
the dry gloves, and now

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.159
we've got heating systems that
we can put into these things,

00:17:35.159 --> 00:17:37.072
and that really helps us out.

00:17:37.072 --> 00:17:39.030
And of course now we've
got some very nice huts

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:41.580
that we can use out on
the ice or in the field.

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:45.320
We can store our dive gear
inside, dry everything, hang up

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.410
our dive suits, make sure
that they're bone dry,

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:49.900
and keep our science
equipment happy.

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:52.740
And this is sort of our typical
set up in the Dry Valleys right

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.420
now.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:57.374
We use surface supplied
air for our dives.

00:17:57.374 --> 00:17:59.290
And you can see the rack
of tanks in the back.

00:17:59.290 --> 00:18:03.232
And in the box on the right
we have an air compressor.

00:18:03.232 --> 00:18:04.690
And then we open
up this yellow box

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:08.420
and it's our gas management
system and a comm. box.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:11.380
So this is where the
tender would be standing,

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.440
or a dive supervisor
would be standing

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.290
to communicate with
the diver underwater

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.560
to help with safety
issues and also

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.770
to record the science
that's going on.

00:18:20.770 --> 00:18:22.820
And then we have a tether.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:25.690
In this case it's a
tether that allows air

00:18:25.690 --> 00:18:27.620
to flow back and forth
on surface supplied.

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:32.370
And they're usually between 70
meters or a little bit more,

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.180
maybe 100 meters
depending on the tether.

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:36.580
But when you're that far
out it's a pretty long ways.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.620
If you're a football
field length

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:41.245
out on a line
under the ice, when

00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:43.370
you're that far away you've
got to ask yourself can

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:45.250
I swim back on one breath.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.400
And usually that answer is no.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.000
So that gives you
pause for thought

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.770
when you're that far out.

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.350
So what I want to
do now-- So that's

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:56.870
sort of the history
of where we've

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.535
gone over the years
in the Dry Valleys.

00:18:59.535 --> 00:19:01.249
But I want to shift
gears a little bit

00:19:01.249 --> 00:19:03.540
and go into a little more
detail about some of the work

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.360
that we're doing
in Lake Untersee.

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.900
And this is pretty cool
work that we started up

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:13.890
in 2008 with a very different
model for doing the research.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.910
And this is our dive
logo from last year.

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.900
In fact, here's our research
team from this last season.

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.020
And Alfonso, who's here
in the audience with us,

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:28.070
is standing next to me on
the right hand side there.

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:29.960
And it's a fairly
international team.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.610
We have normally
about six people

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.060
or so who go down with us.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:39.130
I like to keep the
field teams small.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:42.190
It's nice to be able to pick
from a known pool of people.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.130
So we've work with
people over the years,

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:46.110
and we know who's reliable
in the field, who's

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:48.401
reliable with their skills,
you know if they're a diver

00:19:48.401 --> 00:19:50.890
or if they're a
climber, or if they're

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.560
good at one particular
set of skills

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.610
it's nice to be able to
count on them for doing that.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.070
And again, it's
very international.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:00.450
This last few seasons we've had
people from Russia, Australia,

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.880
New Zealand, Canada, and this
next season we'll probably,

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.430
if we're lucky, have some people
from Japan coming with us.

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:10.000
The selection of
people and individuals

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.480
really is dependent
on the kind of science

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.650
that we're doing
at any given time.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.860
But I really prefer
to have individuals

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:19.160
that we've worked
with before, or have

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.450
had people that had
worked with us that

00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:24.020
had had other experiences with
other people that we know,

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.561
so that we can
understand how they're

00:20:25.561 --> 00:20:27.940
going to operate in the field.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.210
And sort of the additional
things that we looked for,

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.116
so in addition to
your science skills,

00:20:32.116 --> 00:20:33.490
you know we're
looking for people

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:39.720
that have a multi-dimensional
capability to them.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.910
So we want them to have other
tools in their tool kit.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.450
They've got to be skilled at
doing a diverse set of things,

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:48.640
like being able to dive,
or being able to climb,

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.640
understanding how to
operate in cold conditions,

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.723
and understanding how to
work in those conditions.

00:20:52.723 --> 00:20:54.370
And those are all
things that you

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.050
don't come to just naturally.

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:59.260
It's something that takes
time and effort to learn.

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.397
And learning how to operate
in these environments safely,

00:21:02.397 --> 00:21:03.980
and being able to
count on one another

00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:06.235
is something that's
really paramount to us.

00:21:06.235 --> 00:21:08.110
And so I want people
that can work in a group

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.985
or work individually.

00:21:08.985 --> 00:21:10.649
If we've got a little
problem we want

00:21:10.649 --> 00:21:12.940
to be able to send somebody
off and just say, go puzzle

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.100
this out, and figure
it out, you know

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.016
don't bother us for a
while, just get it done,

00:21:16.016 --> 00:21:18.790
and you expect that to happen.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:21.560
We want people that know
when it's time to talk

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.410
and when it's time to listen,
when it's time to lead

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.880
and when it's time to follow.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.950
And those are also very
important skill sets

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.167
that are applicable
in everyday life,

00:21:31.167 --> 00:21:33.125
but they're really, really
important for us out

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:34.196
in the field.

00:21:34.196 --> 00:21:35.570
And it's really
important to have

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:37.444
a person that knows how
to tie the right knot

00:21:37.444 --> 00:21:40.100
at the right time, which
kind of sums it up.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.900
So our journey to
Lake Untersee starts

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.580
in Cape Town, South Africa.

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:46.460
That's where the team
assembles, and we

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:48.630
all board an Ilyushin 76.

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:58.455
And this is an interesting
project in that unlike the work

00:21:58.455 --> 00:21:59.830
we do in the
McMurdo Dry Valleys,

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:02.860
where we're typically supported
through NASA or the National

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:05.350
Science Foundation and
participate in the US Antarctic

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:09.240
program, in this case we're
totally privately funded

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.270
but we're also embedded in
the Russian Antarctic program.

00:22:12.270 --> 00:22:16.180
So it's an interesting mix of
how we go about the funding

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.360
process and getting down
there to do the work.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.850
ALCI is a company that formed
from some of the people that

00:22:23.850 --> 00:22:27.995
arrived in that area after the
breakup of the Soviet Union.

00:22:27.995 --> 00:22:29.370
And they decided
that their skill

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.670
set was that they knew how to
do logistics in polar regions,

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.500
and so they set up the company
ALCI to provide logistics

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.060
in the Queen Maud Land
region, and they service now

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.779
as a nonprofit company.

00:22:39.779 --> 00:22:42.070
The [INAUDIBLE] community,
which is about 13 countries.

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.345
And then also
there's another side

00:22:44.345 --> 00:22:45.803
of the company that
deals with some

00:22:45.803 --> 00:22:47.136
of the tourism that's picked up.

00:22:47.136 --> 00:22:48.690
But we jump inside
this aircraft,

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:51.930
and it's about a six hour flight
to get down to Novo station.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:55.050
We land on a
prepared ice runway.

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:58.972
And this is actually a pretty
good piece of technology

00:22:58.972 --> 00:23:00.430
to be able to build
a runway that's

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:02.220
safe to land on in these
kind of environments,

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.594
and the Russians have been
doing it for a very long time,

00:23:04.594 --> 00:23:06.900
and they're very good at that.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.240
And again, ALCI's
ice runway is the hub

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.730
for Queen Maud Land
for many countries,

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:19.690
like the UK, Japan, Belgium,
South Africa, of course Russia,

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:21.860
and a number of others.

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:23.890
Our first piece
of business to do

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:25.660
is to actually
unload the aircraft.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:27.010
That's part of our deal.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.970
As soon as the plane
lands we don't walk off

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.140
to some little hut
to go get coffee.

00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:33.220
We walk to the back
of the jet and start

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.190
unloading the entire aircraft,
and in particular look

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:38.940
for the stuff that you
brought down, and pile it up,

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.520
and get it over to where
it's supposed to go.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.810
And again, we're guests at
Novolazarevskaya Station,

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.710
the Russian station at
Schirmacher Oasis, which

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:50.150
has been there operationally
since about IGY.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.506
I think it was built
in 1960 or '61.

00:23:53.506 --> 00:23:55.430
And again, the environment
of the Antarctic,

00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:56.710
so it's always cold.

00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:59.050
And unlike what you
typically think,

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:00.597
sometimes it's
not brutally cold.

00:24:00.597 --> 00:24:03.180
Sometimes our temperatures are
not in the minus 40's and minus

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.090
50's.

00:24:04.090 --> 00:24:06.090
In fact, most of the time
that we're there we're

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:08.820
in the summertime, and the
temperatures are typically

00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.980
cold when we first get there.

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.850
And in this case, Lake
Untersee in Schirmacher Oasis

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:16.390
is fairly north in
terms of the Antarctic,

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:19.130
and our mean annual temperature
in this area is about minus 10.

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:22.015
So we see minus 10's and minus
15 C's while we're there.

00:24:22.015 --> 00:24:24.140
And then the temperatures
creep up towards freezing

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.150
during the summer months.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:28.080
Light, it's usually
by the time we

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.240
get there it's light
24 hours a day.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.470
So we do have to
worry about that

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:34.225
and how it effects
our working cycle.

00:24:34.225 --> 00:24:36.600
And that's very important for
us to try to stay on track,

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:37.814
so we won't start drifting.

00:24:37.814 --> 00:24:39.980
You don't want individuals
on your team drifting off

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.950
in different time schedules so
that all of sudden everybody's

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:43.357
waking up at different times.

00:24:43.357 --> 00:24:45.690
So that's another important
part of the work that we do.

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:47.760
Medical care, we
have to understand

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.360
where we can get
some medical care.

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.940
We can get some at Novo station.

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:52.770
But for the diving
aspects of this,

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:54.320
our nearest
re-compression chamber

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:58.140
is in South Africa, which is a
six, seven hour flight away one

00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:58.870
way.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:00.870
So a jet would have to
come down, take us back,

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:01.750
and then of course,
we would have

00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:04.000
to get in from the
mountains of Queen Maud Land

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.790
into the iced runway to
get on that jet again.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:11.054
So it's a non-trivial
process if we have a problem.

00:25:11.054 --> 00:25:13.220
And then the same hazards
that you typically expect,

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.190
you know falling
through crevices,

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:18.840
getting stuck in really bad
weather outside in storms.

00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.710
And then we have the
physical isolation.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:23.306
Once we're put out into our
field site the six of us

00:25:23.306 --> 00:25:24.430
are pretty much on our own.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:25.888
You know, we don't
have any contact

00:25:25.888 --> 00:25:29.670
other than calling into the Novo
Station a couple times a day

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.270
to let them know that we're OK.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.880
Otherwise, we're totally
apart from everybody.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:34.747
We're isolated.

00:25:34.747 --> 00:25:36.330
And we don't have
contact with anybody

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:40.992
other than through a low
bandwidth Iridium phone.

00:25:40.992 --> 00:25:42.450
But before we go
out there, we have

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:43.920
to assemble all of our gear.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.177
So we have some gear
that we store down there.

00:25:46.177 --> 00:25:46.760
We have tents.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.140
And we've got sleeping bags,
and snowmobiles, and things.

00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.000
And we spend a couple of
days getting organized

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.370
and pulling all this gear
together, and preparing it

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:56.150
for transport.

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:58.370
And that's actually
a pretty big effort.

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:02.120
And as I get older and older
I find that that recovery

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.430
from having to do this
kind of hard labor--

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:05.590
Because we're not actually
scientists I think.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:06.673
I think we're just movers.

00:26:06.673 --> 00:26:08.570
We just move things
from pole to pole.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:12.130
And it's always heavy things.

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.172
But we end up taking this trip.

00:26:14.172 --> 00:26:15.630
And in the upper
part of the screen

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:17.190
you'll see Schirmacher Oasis.

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:19.370
And that's about
30 kilometers long.

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:22.480
And if you can see the little
light blue line in there

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.920
that's actually our GPS track
that goes across the ice

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.310
and inland into the mountains
over to Lake Untersee.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.540
And you'll see that
line go down a glacier,

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:34.460
and then it hits the lake
that you can see down

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.910
at the bottom right
part of the screen.

00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:38.820
So that's our road
to Lake Untersee.

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:41.180
It takes about
six to eight hours

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:45.360
to make that trip over the ice
by snowmobile, or by truck,

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:46.590
or track vehicle.

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:49.048
And again, that depends on the
weather, and the conditions,

00:26:49.048 --> 00:26:51.596
and the visibility.

00:26:51.596 --> 00:26:52.990
And this is where we're going.

00:26:52.990 --> 00:26:57.300
This is a satellite image map of
Lake Untersee and Lake Oversea.

00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:00.040
You can see the Anuchin Glacier
makes this really nice sloping

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:03.357
road right down to the
lake's surface, which

00:27:03.357 --> 00:27:05.690
is quite nice for us because
we can literally drive down

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.940
that glacier right
on to the lake ice.

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:10.510
And that's the main place that
we've been doing our work.

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:14.120
In the upper right hand side
you can see Lake Oversea.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.020
And this is where we
were camped last year.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.631
We wanted to do a comparison
with Lake Oversea to Lake

00:27:18.631 --> 00:27:20.505
Untersee, and we found
we were able to get up

00:27:20.505 --> 00:27:23.510
to Oversea for a season to
do that work this last year.

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:30.330
Another part of work in
this area, of course,

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:33.480
is the whole history of
working in the Antarctic,

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:36.087
because it's only been
very short period of time

00:27:36.087 --> 00:27:37.670
that people have
actually been working

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:39.409
down there since its discovery.

00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:41.700
You know, it's only been
within a couple of generations

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.460
that these places have been
worked and actually visited

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:45.930
by people.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:48.380
So in this area
it was the Germans

00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.350
who discovered Schirmacher
Oasis in the mountains

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:54.100
in Queen Maud Land on the third
German Antarctic Expedition

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.147
back in 1938.

00:27:55.147 --> 00:27:57.730
It was during part of the build
up of the war effort for them,

00:27:57.730 --> 00:27:59.521
and they were actually
trying to find areas

00:27:59.521 --> 00:28:02.430
that they could put
in whaling stations

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.790
so they could get
whale oil to help

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.790
their industrial processes.

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.812
And during that
work they came in,

00:28:08.812 --> 00:28:10.020
and they found the mountains.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:12.478
And that was the first time
that this lake was photographed

00:28:12.478 --> 00:28:15.920
was in 1938, 1938 and 1939.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.520
It wasn't mapped really
until the Soviets came back

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.840
in during IGY, and
then the Norwegians

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.390
came in a little while
later and started

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:26.650
doing the more serious aerial
photography of the area.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:28.710
But this lake wasn't
visited by a person

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:32.720
until 1969, which I
think is kind of cool.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.130
Just the same time the first
time we went to the moon.

00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.962
So I've always thought
that was kind of nice.

00:28:37.962 --> 00:28:39.420
And then more
recently there's been

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:42.320
extensive work done by some
of the Germans and Russians,

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.140
and others in the '80s.

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:47.480
And we've kind of taken over
the place for the last few years

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.020
going back off
and on since 2008.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:51.080
You know, we've made
four trips there sense.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.777
AUDIENCE: What
does SAE stand for?

00:28:53.777 --> 00:28:56.110
DALE ANDERSON: The question
was what does SAE stand for.

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.040
And it's the Soviet
Antarctic Expedition.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:01.480
So the SAE is Soviet
and the RAE is Russian

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:05.770
after it switched over
in the early '90s.

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:08.854
But this is where
this site is located.

00:29:08.854 --> 00:29:10.520
These are some of the
mountains that you

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.820
find in this area
of Queen Maud Land.

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.490
And it's stunningly
beautiful mountains.

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:19.520
It's truly just
magnificence defined,

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:23.260
looking at these spires of
rock coming up out of the ice

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:24.980
like they do.

00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.400
And this is our trip.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:29.920
So we literally start going
across this barren wasteland

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:33.770
of blue ice and
snow, and we do have

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:35.650
to worry about crevices
as we're going out.

00:29:35.650 --> 00:29:37.233
In particular, there
are several areas

00:29:37.233 --> 00:29:40.380
that are laden with crevices,
and it takes us several hours

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:41.520
to get across those spots.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.186
And usually we end
up pulling the trucks

00:29:43.186 --> 00:29:46.174
out a dozen or so times
by the time we get out,

00:29:46.174 --> 00:29:47.840
and hopefully without
breaking anything.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:52.900
Occasionally we break the
wheels or things fall off

00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:54.280
and we have to put them back on.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.550
But here you can see one of the
trucks has got a tire stuck,

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.930
and the other truck has
moved over in front of it,

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:02.150
and is using the winch
to pull it back out.

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:05.080
Now oddly enough, last year
we had this same scenario

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:06.420
take place.

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:07.600
The truck got stuck.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.360
Actually I was in one truck
and Alfonso was in the other.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.530
And so my truck got stuck.

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:15.040
And Alfonso's truck
pulled out in front of us

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:19.550
and went around to come up
in front to put the winch on.

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:21.960
And they were a
pretty good ways away,

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.120
and their truck got stuck.

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:25.770
So we were just really
fortunate enough

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:28.820
that the winches from both
trucks reached to one another

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.180
and we were able to
pull each other out.

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:32.920
Otherwise it would
have been a long day.

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.260
But we also have
to snowmobile out.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.843
So this is actually one of the
funner parts of the trip for me

00:30:36.843 --> 00:30:39.630
I think is skidooing out
into the mountains like this,

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:44.000
and it's a really
unique and intimate way

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.910
to learn how to live in the
cold and work in the cold

00:30:46.910 --> 00:30:50.690
is when you ride skidoos
in the Antarctic like this.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:52.410
But eventually we
all get to the lake.

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:53.700
The trucks arrive.

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.510
They dump all of our gear off.

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:57.560
And the trucks depart.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.327
And we have to set up
our camp and start work.

00:31:00.327 --> 00:31:02.160
And this is really,
really an important part

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.940
of the trip right at this very
moment, because our support has

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:08.941
left, we're on our own,
and now the first thing

00:31:08.941 --> 00:31:10.440
that we have to do
is get shelter up

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.964
very quickly, because this area
is really prone to high winds.

00:31:13.964 --> 00:31:15.630
So we need to have
at least one tent up.

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:18.020
It usually takes
us about three days

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:20.370
to get the camp
fully established.

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:22.690
But if we don't get
that first tent up,

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:24.560
or two tents up, or as
many as we can get up

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.726
depending on how tired we
are and the timing of when

00:31:26.726 --> 00:31:29.494
we arrive, we could get
nailed by really bad weather,

00:31:29.494 --> 00:31:31.910
and we'd be spending it out
in the rocks instead of inside

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:33.280
in a tent.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.717
But once the tent's established,
the camps established,

00:31:35.717 --> 00:31:37.300
we have a pretty
nice home, and that's

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.990
where we live for the
next six to eight weeks.

00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:43.550
And again, it's just a
really stunning backdrop.

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.910
The lake is completely ringed
by these large mountains.

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:50.900
And these mountains are all
composed of an [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.260
site, which plays an important
role in controlling some

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:58.410
of the chemical features,
for example the lake water.

00:31:58.410 --> 00:31:59.270
But here it is.

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:03.170
This is a true example of
a land of rock and ice.

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:05.030
This is the surface
of Lake Untersee.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:08.520
So we've got 2 and 1/2 to 3 and
1/2 meters of ice on the lake.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.650
And we've also got probably
several hundred boulders.

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:13.630
Some of these
boulders are larger

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:16.726
than the snowmobiles, maybe
two, three times as large

00:32:16.726 --> 00:32:19.170
as the snowmobile that
have worked their way out

00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:22.030
on to the ice, and are
floating on that ice surface.

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:26.350
So it's not too often that you
get to see floating boulders.

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:29.180
This is our tent
camp from last year.

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:30.940
I just wanted to
give you an example

00:32:30.940 --> 00:32:35.090
of how we establish the camp
and why we put it up this way.

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:37.190
I took my personal
drone down with me.

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:41.460
The DGI loaned me a Phantom
to take down with me,

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:43.860
so I've got a Phantom
with a Go-Pro on it,

00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.950
and shot some
aerials of our camp.

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:48.920
And you can see that we've got
a science tent in the back.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.367
We've got our cook
tent and the dive tent.

00:32:52.367 --> 00:32:54.450
And then we've got some
individual sleeping tents,

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:56.860
a toilet tent, and
then some sundry gear,

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:58.440
and some small generators.

00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.750
But this is our home and
this is how we establish it.

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:03.080
And we work in and
out of it like this.

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.090
And again, it's important
to maintain that schedule

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:06.780
that we have.

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.150
So we try to stay on
schedule for breakfast

00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:11.830
in the mornings, kind of a
lunch, snack time whenever

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:14.990
we want it, working
around work, and then we

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:18.670
try to come in for a dinner
time around 6 o'clock or so.

00:33:18.670 --> 00:33:20.200
But it's really
also very important

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.741
that we have a place
to retreat into.

00:33:21.741 --> 00:33:24.464
We keep heat on in a couple of
these facilities like the dive

00:33:24.464 --> 00:33:27.130
tent, we have to keep heat on to
keep some of the dive gear dry.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:28.610
The science tent
has to have heat

00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:31.480
so we can keep some of our
equipment and our science

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:33.229
samples from freezing at times.

00:33:33.229 --> 00:33:35.270
And then it's really
important to keep the people

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:37.870
from freezing too, so with the
cook tent is another key place

00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:40.980
that we have to have heat that
we can come into and get out

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.809
of the cold from time to time.

00:33:42.809 --> 00:33:44.100
Now, we do monitor the climate.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.410
And that's a very
important part of our job.

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:50.196
It's both so we can monitor
climate change in this area,

00:33:50.196 --> 00:33:51.820
but it's also so that
we can understand

00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:56.090
how climate affects
the lake ecosystem.

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:58.670
These are physically
driven ecosystems,

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.350
and that ice cover is
probably the key thing

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:06.600
that impacts the
ecosystem underneath it.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.350
And of course that's
all climately driven,

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:10.183
how thick that ice is
and how long it lasts.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.639
And this is the kind of
weather that we do tend to see.

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:16.630
And if we have
time, I'll show you

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:18.270
a quick video towards
the end that'll

00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:19.728
demonstrate this
a little bit more,

00:34:19.728 --> 00:34:23.199
but we do see pretty heavy
winds from time to time.

00:34:23.199 --> 00:34:26.750
The temperatures wax and wane,
but our mean annual temperature

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:29.230
in this area is, like I
said, about minus 10 degrees

00:34:29.230 --> 00:34:30.540
C. So that's not so bad.

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.334
It's really the winds that
make the working there

00:34:33.334 --> 00:34:34.000
a little harder.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.190
So when it's really windy
outside and it's cloudy

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:40.440
that's those difficult days
for us to work outside.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.750
Now, it's interesting to compare
this area with the McMurdo Dry

00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:44.850
Valleys.

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:46.230
These are Alpine lakes.

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:49.300
Lake Untersee is at about
560 meters in altitude,

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:51.110
and Lake Oversea is
about 800 meters.

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:54.500
So they're Alpine lakes
but a little higher up.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.980
The McMurdo Dry Valleys
are a little further south

00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.210
towards the south pole.

00:34:59.210 --> 00:35:03.040
We're a little further
north at Lake Untersee.

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:05.000
The McMurdo Dry
Valleys though, if you

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.530
look at their
hydrological cycle,

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:09.380
it's really based on melt.

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.270
So when the peak temperatures
during the summers

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:16.890
come up just above freezing
the glaciers tend to melt off.

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:19.150
That liquid water drains
down into the valleys

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:21.050
and replenishes the
water for the lakes.

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:24.780
That seems pretty
easy to imagine,

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:26.760
and it's the way it works there.

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.050
In the Untersee area
it's a little different.

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:31.320
We don't see melt.

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:35.160
The evaporation rates are so
high that sublimation really

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.526
is the dominant feature here.

00:35:36.526 --> 00:35:38.400
So we don't see melt
running off the glacier.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.190
As a matter of fact, that's
why we can actually drive down

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:42.010
the glacier, because if
the glacier was melting

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.000
we would have these large
melt channels in it.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.208
Otherwise, we have this nice
smooth road coming down,

00:35:46.208 --> 00:35:48.716
where the winds have ablated
it off and kept it smooth.

00:35:48.716 --> 00:35:49.840
It's the same with the ice.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.280
It ablates very quickly
off the surface.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.730
So we don't have
any melt streams

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:54.790
coming into these lakes.

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:56.590
It's one of the quirky things
that we noticed when we first

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:58.730
arrived there and other
people had noticed.

00:35:58.730 --> 00:35:59.897
Where's the water come from?

00:35:59.897 --> 00:36:01.271
There's no melt
streams that come

00:36:01.271 --> 00:36:02.890
in during the height
of the summer.

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:05.750
So it's obviously coming
in from sub-glacial melt

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:07.130
and the front of the glacier.

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:08.713
The Anuchin Glacier
is actually moving

00:36:08.713 --> 00:36:11.030
into this lake at a constant
rate of several meters

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:14.070
per year, and that water
that comes in as ice

00:36:14.070 --> 00:36:16.062
melts and adds to the
water of the lake.

00:36:16.062 --> 00:36:18.020
And then there's probably
also sub-glacial melt

00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:20.256
coming from beneath
the glacier as well.

00:36:20.256 --> 00:36:21.630
So it's a very
different process,

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:27.360
and it has a bigger impact on
how this ecosystem operates.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.940
And you can see that this
is sort of a cartoon cross

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:33.490
section of Lake Untersee we've
got the Anuchin Glacier over

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:34.310
on the left.

00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:38.037
We have a deep basin that goes
down to about 170 metres or so.

00:36:38.037 --> 00:36:39.620
We don't know the
exact deepest point,

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:41.590
but that's the deepest
reported so far.

00:36:41.590 --> 00:36:44.090
Then it comes up a slope out
in front of the peninsula

00:36:44.090 --> 00:36:46.640
where we camp, and where
we have our med station.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:49.320
And then it drops back down
into another anoxic basin

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.120
on the other side that
drops to about 100 meters.

00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:56.184
And this is a really,
really cool lake.

00:36:56.184 --> 00:37:01.214
AUDIENCE: If the average
temperature is below freezing

00:37:01.214 --> 00:37:03.380
where does the heat source
come that keeps the water

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.099
liquid over long
periods of time?

00:37:05.099 --> 00:37:06.640
DALE ANDERSON: Right,
so the question

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.720
is what's the heat
source for keeping

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:13.680
the place liquid over time
if the average temperature is

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.806
minus 10?

00:37:14.806 --> 00:37:16.430
Well, it's the average
temperature, not

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:17.304
the peak temperature.

00:37:17.304 --> 00:37:20.480
So you do have peak temperatures
coming up above freezing

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.300
at times.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.520
But it's also solar heating.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.010
So it's all solar driven.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:26.410
So the sunlight is
the big driver here.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:32.640
So the ice cover actually
traps the heat inside as well.

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:35.837
So once you've got the ice
cover there as freeze up takes

00:37:35.837 --> 00:37:37.420
place the latent
heat pushes back down

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:39.680
and keeps that
heat budget going.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.830
So you'll never freeze it
down solid unless it really

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:44.600
gets cold for a long,
long period of time.

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:52.930
But the water again is
very, very transparent,

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:56.950
which comes back to driving
that heat into the lake.

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:59.794
And we see quite a bit
of the light penetrating

00:37:59.794 --> 00:38:00.710
through the ice cover.

00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:04.685
We get around 5% in this lake
ice to get through the ice.

00:38:04.685 --> 00:38:06.060
And then we can
probably get some

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.844
of that light down
to at least 130

00:38:07.844 --> 00:38:10.360
to 140 meters, or
probably even deeper.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:13.900
We found microbial
mats growing at a depth

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:18.840
of 160 meters in this
mat photosynthetically.

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.174
It's an interesting lake also
because the water pH is up

00:38:21.174 --> 00:38:21.673
high.

00:38:21.673 --> 00:38:23.680
It's 10.6, which is
kind of unusual for some

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:25.690
of these lakes.

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:27.690
But what really sets
this lake off apart

00:38:27.690 --> 00:38:31.430
from a lot of the other lakes
is in that anaerobic basin,

00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:35.020
down below about 80 meters, from
80 meters down to 100 meters,

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.230
the methane levels
just go crazy,

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:40.770
and you get dissolved
methane in this lake

00:38:40.770 --> 00:38:43.212
at 20 millimole, which
is very, very unusual.

00:38:43.212 --> 00:38:45.253
There's only a few places
around the planet where

00:38:45.253 --> 00:38:47.970
you can get dissolved
methane levels that high.

00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:51.380
There's some rift
lakes in Africa,

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:54.760
like Lake Kivu, that
has that in that lake.

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:57.980
And then also right on
top of methane clathrates

00:38:57.980 --> 00:39:02.040
in the ocean, right at that
surface above the methane

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:04.720
clathrates you'd see
values like that.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.110
So it's very unusual that
you see this much methane

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:08.840
production in a lake.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.160
And just as an example,
if you took a one liter

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.950
bottle down the
bottom, 100 meters,

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:15.000
opened it up, filled
it up with that water,

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.074
and brought it to the
surface, and opened it,

00:39:17.074 --> 00:39:19.240
you'd get about a half a
liter of methane out of it.

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.180
So it's a pretty
substantial amount of gas.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:24.260
In fact, you could
plumb it with a pipe,

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.030
bring that pipe to the surface,
and then burn it if you wanted.

00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:29.800
Now, the whole volume of gas
in there's not a huge amount,

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.110
so you'd burn it out
pretty quickly, which

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:32.943
wouldn't be a cool thing
to do for the lake,

00:39:32.943 --> 00:39:35.290
but interesting to think about.

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:37.240
So this is our
typical kind of a day.

00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.540
We have to drill
holes, melt holes,

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:43.350
saw the holes to get
in to make them bigger,

00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:45.305
break the ice out to
get a little bigger,

00:39:45.305 --> 00:39:47.180
and then jump into the water.

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.720
So that's the kind
of work that we

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.720
do, that once we get
the holes opened up then

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.470
we can really start
our work, whether it's

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:55.400
with a sampling device, an
instrument, or the divers

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.630
doing some specific cast.

00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:59.120
But here we are.

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:00.910
This is Chris McKay
and myself getting

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:04.470
ready to continue through
a hole that we've already

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:08.030
been working on
at Lake Untersee.

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:12.460
Every time we get down a
little farther into the ice

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:15.020
we have to pull the thing
out, add a bit to it,

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:18.130
and put it back into
it to keep extending

00:40:18.130 --> 00:40:20.340
the length of the drill bit.

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:24.280
And here we are making the
final push down through the ice.

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:27.390
And again, sometimes you
have to be very perseverant,

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:30.510
and teamwork is a really
important part of the deal

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:31.010
here.

00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:32.843
So everybody's got to
work together and know

00:40:32.843 --> 00:40:35.310
how to work with one another.

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:39.030
So this is coming
underneath the ice,

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:41.470
and I just want to talk about
the freeze up part again.

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:43.490
So another interesting
part about this score

00:40:43.490 --> 00:40:45.801
with the gases, it's not
just the methane being high,

00:40:45.801 --> 00:40:48.050
but all the other dissolved
gases, the air group gases

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:49.379
are very high as well.

00:40:49.379 --> 00:40:51.670
And so if you look at the
underneath surface of the ice

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:53.860
you'll see these pockets.

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.810
And these are gas
pockets that have formed.

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:58.480
As freeze up takes
place underneath the ice

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.234
the gas molecules are too large
to fit in the ice lattice,

00:41:01.234 --> 00:41:03.150
and they're pushed back
into the water column.

00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:04.608
So it's sort of
like a bicycle pump

00:41:04.608 --> 00:41:06.170
pumping up the gases
is in the lake.

00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:08.620
And eventually the
dissolved gases

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:12.240
will nucleate and form bubbles
just underneath the ice.

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:14.824
And some of these bubbles
get very, very large,

00:41:14.824 --> 00:41:16.990
and in particular, in this
lake they get very large.

00:41:16.990 --> 00:41:18.406
They'll get 10's
of meters across.

00:41:18.406 --> 00:41:20.740
You'll get pools of
gas underneath the ice.

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.250
And some of that
gas will actually

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.030
get entrained in
the ice, and I'll

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:27.930
show you the result of
that here right now.

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:29.990
This is actually
at Lake Oversee.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:36.370
Let's see if you can hear this.

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:37.650
No.

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:40.520
OK well, this is at
Lake Oversee last year.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:42.580
Alfonso and I went out to
drill one of the holes,

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:45.954
and we drilled down
through it, and we

00:41:45.954 --> 00:41:48.370
knew we were going to get a
little bit of water coming up,

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:50.180
but we didn't realize we were
going to get quite so much.

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.346
This was actually enough
water to blow the drill out

00:41:52.346 --> 00:41:53.100
of the hole.

00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:55.290
So we were holding onto
it, and Alfonso finally

00:41:55.290 --> 00:41:56.740
asked me what to do.

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:58.320
And we turned it off.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:00.284
The drill actually
started reverse drilling

00:42:00.284 --> 00:42:02.200
as fast as it was going
when it was turned on,

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.340
just cause the water
pressures was pushing it

00:42:03.340 --> 00:42:04.780
up the other direction.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.770
And we finally let
go, got the drill out.

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:09.780
We were standing inside
this fountain of water

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:11.860
probably for 10
minutes or so as we

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.150
were trying to deal
with the drill.

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:16.310
And there's Alfonso for scale.

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:18.920
This thing blew water
like this and gas

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:25.070
for I don't know, another hour,
to three hours at that height.

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:28.090
And then it kind of dribbled
out over the next several days.

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:30.330
So there's a huge pool
of gas sitting right up

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:33.280
underneath the ice here, that
will get replenished again as

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.810
soon as more gas comes into
the lake, which there's

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:40.790
a really good source of it
The Anuchin Glacier of course

00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.410
is glacial ice and
glacial ice has

00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:43.859
a lot of entrained
bubbles in it,

00:42:43.859 --> 00:42:46.400
and that gas is basically gets
delivered right into the lake.

00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.316
So it's like an air stone
coming into the lake

00:42:48.316 --> 00:42:50.900
essentially, adding
that much volume of gas

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:53.522
to the lake every year.

00:42:53.522 --> 00:42:55.230
But then it's time to
get into the water.

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:58.630
So we keep a portable compressor
out in the field with us,

00:42:58.630 --> 00:43:01.212
and then we fill up the
tanks, and get everything set,

00:43:01.212 --> 00:43:02.420
and then it's time to get in.

00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:04.330
So at Lake Untersee
we'll usually skidoo over

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:08.810
to our dive site,
get dressed out.

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:11.680
And here I am sporting my new
dry gloves, these Kubi Rings,

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.970
which were really quite nice.

00:43:13.970 --> 00:43:15.812
It's another one of
these things when

00:43:15.812 --> 00:43:17.270
you're diving,
you're always trying

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:19.230
to find the nicest thing
that you can put on,

00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:20.938
the easiest thing that
you can deal with.

00:43:20.938 --> 00:43:24.670
And so far the Kubi Rings, which
are really quite nice for me,

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:28.280
have shown me that I can get
in and out of those ring sets

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.840
very easily, even when I'm cold.

00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:32.980
Sometimes you can get
these dry glove rings on,

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:35.320
but sometimes you can't
get them off very easily.

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:37.290
And these Kubi's work
quite nicely for that

00:43:37.290 --> 00:43:39.020
and they don't leak.

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:40.614
So then down we go.

00:43:40.614 --> 00:43:41.280
We head on down.

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.330
Normally we dive only with one
person under the ice at a time,

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:46.520
because it's more difficult
to have two people in,

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:48.750
especially if you have
an accident or a problem,

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:50.250
and you'd have to have
both divers coming up

00:43:50.250 --> 00:43:51.350
out of the hole at once.

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:53.190
And there's not very
much room in the hole.

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:54.970
So as long as we're
on tether, as long

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:56.830
as we've got good
communications,

00:43:56.830 --> 00:43:58.960
and there's no obstructions
underneath the water,

00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:01.043
we're pretty comfortable
with diving by ourselves.

00:44:01.043 --> 00:44:04.200
And that's been the policy of
our diving in the US Antarctic

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.970
program in these lakes now for
a better part 25 years or more,

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:10.190
and it's worked
out quite nicely.

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:12.190
But on this occasion I
wanted to get some shots.

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:12.550
Go ahead.

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:13.466
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:18.504 --> 00:44:20.420
DALE ANDERSON: Yeah, we
don't go to that deep.

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:22.200
I'll get to that in a second.

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:25.290
The question is since we've
measured the depths down

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:27.750
to 170 meters and 100
meters in both the basins,

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:29.080
do we get down that deep?

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.970
And only instruments
and sampling devices

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:33.110
go down to those depths.

00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:35.510
The divers are 40
meters or above.

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:38.040
So 130 feet is the
deepest that we can go.

00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.440
And we dive very conservatively.

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:43.280
Again, it comes back
to if we have problems,

00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.250
like if we get bent, or
if we have an embolism,

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:47.880
we're going to be in bad shape.

00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:49.692
We can go on to
oxygen in the field,

00:44:49.692 --> 00:44:51.150
and we can do some
basic first aid,

00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:53.191
but it's a long trip to
get back to South Africa.

00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:55.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] your own
air and not any [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:56.824
DALE ANDERSON: Right.

00:44:56.824 --> 00:44:59.070
So the question is
what gas do we use?

00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:02.260
We use air.

00:45:02.260 --> 00:45:05.560
One, we don't really
need any other advantage,

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:09.460
in terms of nitrox it would
give us for time at depth.

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:12.600
What we really just need
is a very simple way

00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:13.992
to compress our air.

00:45:13.992 --> 00:45:15.450
And if we had
nitrox, you know we'd

00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:17.600
have to mix the gas as well.

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:19.100
So we don't want
to have to do that.

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:21.270
And for us the cold
is a bigger driver

00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:23.471
then-- You know, typically
the diver will get cold

00:45:23.471 --> 00:45:25.470
before you'd run out of
gas, unless we're really

00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:27.136
going down deep, and
then nitrox doesn't

00:45:27.136 --> 00:45:28.880
make a difference anyway.

00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:32.330
So we're just on air.

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:34.307
But in this case
I wanted to take

00:45:34.307 --> 00:45:35.890
some shots of a diver
doing some work.

00:45:35.890 --> 00:45:37.624
So I got in with Ian one time.

00:45:37.624 --> 00:45:39.290
Ian went down to take
some core samples.

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.055
So that gave a little
bit of perspective.

00:45:44.055 --> 00:45:45.680
Now, this particular
shot is the bottom

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:46.974
of the lake at Lake Untersee.

00:45:46.974 --> 00:45:48.390
And there's two
features here that

00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:50.220
really pop out very quickly.

00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:51.660
One, it's dominated
on the bottom

00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:53.480
by these large
conical stromatolites.

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.146
And this is the first
time this has ever

00:45:55.146 --> 00:45:56.300
been documented in a lake.

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:58.900
And its relatives go back
about 3 and 1/2 billion years

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.440
in the fossil record.

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:04.330
So it's a pretty
unusual find for us,

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:05.716
and it's a really exciting find.

00:46:05.716 --> 00:46:07.340
Now, if you look up
underneath the ice,

00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:09.330
way off in the distance, you
can see one of those big gas

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:10.496
bubbles I was talking about.

00:46:10.496 --> 00:46:13.700
That's a pool of gas
that's probably 15 to 20,

00:46:13.700 --> 00:46:17.120
or 30 meters across that's just
waiting to get up into the ice

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:20.125
and have us drill into
it one of these years.

00:46:20.125 --> 00:46:23.100
But here's another example of
these conical stromatolites.

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:25.790
Ant it is, it's really a
world that we've never seen.

00:46:25.790 --> 00:46:27.640
So we've seen their
fossil relatives

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.770
in the ancient sediments
of the Pilbara region

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:34.980
for example in
Western Australia.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.500
But we haven't seen
modern examples,

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:38.150
and this is the
only place that we

00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:40.750
know of where these large
conical stromatolites are

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:44.512
forming in a modern setting.

00:46:44.512 --> 00:46:46.250
If you look at the
coloration on them

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:49.580
you'll see that they're
kind of that purplish hue,

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:52.220
that nice pinkish
purplish hue, and that's

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:55.700
the phycoerythrin, which
is the dominant pigment

00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:58.010
for their photosynthesis
capability.

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:00.600
And that's helping them to
collect the light level,

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.280
or the quality of
light that's coming

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.071
through the ice, the
nice blue light that's

00:47:04.071 --> 00:47:05.010
coming down to them.

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:06.830
It's tuned to that light level.

00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:09.130
And they're very, very
efficient at what they do.

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:11.640
They can use every
little bit of sunshine

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:14.534
that comes down through
that ice to make a living.

00:47:14.534 --> 00:47:16.200
And we've got some
of these same players

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.533
that we see in a lot of the
other lakes that we work in.

00:47:18.533 --> 00:47:22.410
Phormidium and leptolyngbya
are the two big guys.

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:25.035
And interestingly there's
no diatoms in these lakes.

00:47:25.035 --> 00:47:26.410
And we don't still
quite know why

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:29.034
that is, whether it's something
special in the chemistry that's

00:47:29.034 --> 00:47:30.870
keeping them from
being there, or it's

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:32.703
just because they're
geographically isolated

00:47:32.703 --> 00:47:34.140
and they haven't
gotten there yet.

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:36.223
But it's probably a
combination of several things.

00:47:36.223 --> 00:47:39.679
But it also may have
an-- We see diatoms

00:47:39.679 --> 00:47:41.470
in all the other
Antarctic lakes that we've

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:42.960
worked in for the most part.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.860
There's a few pockets that
there's reports of no diatoms.

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:47.992
But all of those other
lakes, none of them

00:47:47.992 --> 00:47:49.950
have these large conical
stromatolites growing.

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:53.380
So we think that may play a
role in the morphologies that

00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:55.600
are developing in
this particular lake.

00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:59.850
Maybe the absence of diatoms
helps the cyanobacteria

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:01.770
form the kinds of
structures that they want

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:06.650
versus what the diatoms
help them make later.

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:09.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] this
conical shaped [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.680
DALE ANDERSON: Yeah, so
the modern stromatolites

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.970
that we see are microbial mats.

00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:16.520
These are cyanobacterial
mats that are actively

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:19.753
forming these dome
shaped structures.

00:48:19.753 --> 00:48:21.336
And they're laminated
inside, and I'll

00:48:21.336 --> 00:48:22.777
show you that here in a second.

00:48:22.777 --> 00:48:24.360
These are the same
photosynthetic mats

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.019
that we see at 160 meters.

00:48:26.019 --> 00:48:28.060
And you can see that
they're that very rich pink,

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:29.430
phycoerythrin rich color.

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:31.990
And that's where those accessory
pigments are helping them

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:34.532
to harvest the light
that's available,

00:48:34.532 --> 00:48:36.240
even those one or two
little photons that

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.350
are getting down to that depth.

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:40.990
Now, if you take one of
these conical stromatolites

00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:43.910
that we've got and you slice it
in half this is what you see.

00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:45.600
You can see that
it's very laminated.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:48.470
And in the McMurdo Dry
Valleys over the years

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:50.990
Ian [? Haas ?] and some others
have finally figured out

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:54.060
that most of what we
see are annual layers.

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:57.110
Layers like this are laid
down every single year.

00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:59.430
Here, once we came
back and we did

00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:04.230
some of the radiocarbon dating
to see how old this thing was,

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:07.030
the relative dates between
just a few centimeters

00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:09.610
apart was upwards
of 2,500 years.

00:49:09.610 --> 00:49:13.080
And so the math didn't
work out for a yearly

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:16.404
or an annual deposition, but
it's more of a decadal scale.

00:49:16.404 --> 00:49:18.570
So it's taking a long time
to build these things up.

00:49:18.570 --> 00:49:20.220
And that makes sense because
there's very, very little

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:21.890
sediment that we
see in these waters.

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:24.760
So these formations
take a pretty long while

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:28.050
to get to where they're at.

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:29.880
Again, the question
is does it actually

00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:33.935
take 2,500 years to build
this little tiny conical

00:49:33.935 --> 00:49:35.742
stromatolite that
we've got here?

00:49:35.742 --> 00:49:37.450
OK, here's just a
couple of shots of this

00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:40.969
is sort of again the
typical work that we do.

00:49:40.969 --> 00:49:42.760
That really does
transport us back in time.

00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:44.600
Here's Ian taking
those core samples,

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:46.630
and you can see that
they're little tiny plugs.

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:49.030
Also, notice how gently
Ian is on the bottom.

00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:51.160
So this is another really
big part of the training

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.299
that we have to do for
working in these lakes.

00:49:53.299 --> 00:49:54.840
These lakes are very
delicate, and we

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:56.464
don't want to disturb
the microbial mat

00:49:56.464 --> 00:49:57.610
systems very much.

00:49:57.610 --> 00:50:01.510
So you have to really understand
how to control your buoyancy.

00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:02.860
And that's a real skill.

00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:05.430
It's actually a
difficult skill to learn,

00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:07.980
and most people don't
pick up on it very easily.

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:10.396
But here you can see that the
only thing that are touching

00:50:10.396 --> 00:50:12.290
are the tips of his
fins on one side

00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:15.365
and where his hand is
picking up the core,

00:50:15.365 --> 00:50:17.490
and then you can see the
core box over on the side.

00:50:17.490 --> 00:50:20.150
So we make sure that the
areas that we disturb

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:24.382
are really minimized by
working hard to do that.

00:50:24.382 --> 00:50:27.530
Now again, if you went back in
time 3 and 1/2 billion years

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:29.950
ago, and Chris, Alfonso and I
did this a couple years ago.

00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:31.420
We went over to
Western Australia

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:32.820
into the Pilbara region.

00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:35.060
And this is sort of a
mecca for astrobiologists

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:37.560
because this is one of the
areas where you can go,

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.910
it's one of the very few areas
on the planet Earth today

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:42.201
where the rocks haven't been
folded back into the earth

00:50:42.201 --> 00:50:45.540
and put into the
furnaces so to speak

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:46.707
and had the records removed.

00:50:46.707 --> 00:50:49.081
It's one of the few places
where you can go back and find

00:50:49.081 --> 00:50:51.680
sedimentary rocks that date
back 3 and 1/2 billion years,

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:53.660
and find evidence
of life in them.

00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:57.305
So what you're looking at here
are some conical stromatolites

00:50:57.305 --> 00:50:58.850
that are preserved
in that record.

00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:04.770
The one on top is about
a billion .8 years old,

00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:06.210
and then the two
over on the right

00:51:06.210 --> 00:51:11.150
are 3 and 1/2 billion years
almost over in an area

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:12.060
that we visited.

00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.930
So those are actually
outcrops in the rocks

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:15.787
that we saw and
photographed at the time.

00:51:15.787 --> 00:51:18.120
And you can see the three
dimensional cones in the lower

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:20.740
one, the lower right,
are a great match

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:24.027
up for the conical stromatolites
that we have in the lake.

00:51:24.027 --> 00:51:26.610
So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to just really briefly go

00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:28.540
through a few tools of the trade
that we've got just so you can

00:51:28.540 --> 00:51:30.394
see some of the things
that we work with,

00:51:30.394 --> 00:51:32.560
and then I'll be wrapping
it up here pretty quickly.

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.137
But this is the typical
stuff that we use.

00:51:35.137 --> 00:51:36.220
We'll take sediment cores.

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:41.080
We have light meters, oxygen
and pH meters, conductivity,

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:43.680
temperature, depth meters.

00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:46.190
We use flourometers
to help us understand

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:48.730
how the microbial mats are
able to photosynthesize

00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:50.810
under the conditions
that they're in.

00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:53.020
And then we have these
underwater micro sensors

00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:56.690
that allow us to check
for pH and oxygen levels

00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:59.640
down inside the mats at a very,
very high resolution scale.

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.580
And then of course
we've got cameras.

00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:04.760
And the LIDAR system
is actually a unit

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:06.802
that we've used once
to paint the bottom.

00:52:06.802 --> 00:52:08.510
And it gives us a
three dimensional image

00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:09.427
of the bottom of lake.

00:52:09.427 --> 00:52:11.551
And these are some of the
things that we take down.

00:52:11.551 --> 00:52:13.629
So this is the PAM
flourometer that we take down.

00:52:13.629 --> 00:52:15.920
And again, you have to come
down and place these things

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.865
into a certain position
without tearing the place apart

00:52:17.865 --> 00:52:19.610
and actually tearing
apart the study

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:21.071
site that you're
trying to study.

00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:22.320
And it's difficult to do that.

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.440
It looks like it's
easy, but it's not,

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:25.625
because you're on a tether.

00:52:25.625 --> 00:52:27.587
You've got big
weights on your belt.

00:52:27.587 --> 00:52:29.045
You're carrying
equipment with you.

00:52:29.045 --> 00:52:30.800
You've got the buoyancy
control issues.

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.383
So it's a real skill set to get
these things down and put them

00:52:33.383 --> 00:52:35.320
in place properly.

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:38.890
This is the micro
electrode system.

00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:42.800
And what you see here is
a box over on the side

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:44.967
that will record the data
and take the measurements.

00:52:44.967 --> 00:52:46.424
And then over on
the left hand side

00:52:46.424 --> 00:52:47.950
you see the micro
electrode that's

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:50.130
been attached to a
stage micrometer.

00:52:50.130 --> 00:52:53.600
And we can actually push
this little fine needle,

00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:56.140
at the very end it's thinner
than a human hair, down

00:52:56.140 --> 00:52:58.727
into the microbial mats at
a half a micron increment.

00:52:58.727 --> 00:53:00.810
And this is actually the
coldest work that we did,

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:04.060
because as a diver you
sit down at the bottom

00:53:04.060 --> 00:53:07.450
and all you do is move
your fingers very slowly

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:10.370
over a period of anywhere
from 30 minutes to an hour.

00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:13.729
And that's where your hands
just really get pretty cold.

00:53:13.729 --> 00:53:15.770
And that's why the new
electrically heated gloves

00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:18.103
are probably going to be real
help for this kind of work

00:53:18.103 --> 00:53:21.070
in the future.

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:22.730
This is an example of the LIDAR.

00:53:22.730 --> 00:53:25.270
So you'll notice here that
we've got a lift bag on it.

00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:28.230
So when we use tools
like this-- Actually this

00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:34.100
is the same version of that
little micro electrode system,

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:35.420
but it's an automated system.

00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:36.560
But it's large
enough that we have

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.518
to use a lift bag to pull
it over into the spot

00:53:38.518 --> 00:53:41.020
that we want it, gently lower
it down, and then use it

00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:42.070
from the surface.

00:53:42.070 --> 00:53:45.135
It's really nice to do it
that way from the surface,

00:53:45.135 --> 00:53:47.260
but it's also difficult
getting the thing in place.

00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:49.510
So there's trade offs on
using this kind of technology

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:50.340
as well.

00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:51.620
There's the LIDAR system.

00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:53.130
Again, it's is a
large item that we

00:53:53.130 --> 00:53:55.640
have to take down with a lift
bag and put in place gently.

00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.840
And then it paints the
area with a green laser,

00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:59.298
and gives us that
three dimensional

00:53:59.298 --> 00:54:02.020
map of those microbial
mats on the bottom.

00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:03.970
And then there's this
very simple stuff.

00:54:03.970 --> 00:54:05.220
This is just Plexiglas tubes.

00:54:05.220 --> 00:54:06.844
And these are things
that we stick down

00:54:06.844 --> 00:54:09.120
into the dirt to
collect samples.

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:12.130
And there we go, back to home.

00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:14.027
But after we're
done with the dives,

00:54:14.027 --> 00:54:15.610
then we have to take
the samples back,

00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:18.110
and we have to take them back
into the lab and process them.

00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:20.790
So there's quite a bit
of work left afterwards.

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:24.710
And that's sort of the end of
the day for us is coming in,

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:27.417
and finished up the samples,
and then checking on the camp,

00:54:27.417 --> 00:54:29.750
then going back in to dinner,
and getting ready for bed.

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:32.220
So what I want to do right now
is just show a quick video.

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:34.590
And I don't know if there's
audio on here or not.

00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:37.082
We'll see.

00:54:37.082 --> 00:54:38.790
And this will kind of
sum up a little bit

00:54:38.790 --> 00:54:39.873
of what we've been seeing.

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:46.550
And there's no audio.

00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:22.660
And this is just a panorama
around a little bit

00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:23.160
of the area.

00:55:30.645 --> 00:55:33.140
And just briefly, this is
New Zealand [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:38.202 --> 00:55:40.660
This is just an example of some
of the whether that we see.

00:55:40.660 --> 00:55:42.180
So this is not a
too, too bad day.

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:45.690
This is actually with winds that
are only about 45 or 50 knots.

00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:49.439
When they're blowing
at close to 100 knots

00:55:49.439 --> 00:55:51.730
that's when we have to really
be a little more careful.

00:55:51.730 --> 00:55:54.300
And we have measured
winds creeping up

00:55:54.300 --> 00:55:57.620
to 50 meters per second, which
is around 112 miles an hour.

00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:59.681
We have lost tents in the field.

00:55:59.681 --> 00:56:01.430
Sometimes the winds
come down, and they're

00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:03.510
just like bowling
balls hitting the tent.

00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:06.096
And they'll just
flatten one tent.

00:56:06.096 --> 00:56:07.970
Like two years ago, I
was sitting in my tent,

00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:12.240
and a couple minutes later
the tent was sitting on me.

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:14.097
So we do have to keep
extra tents outside.

00:56:14.097 --> 00:56:15.930
And during these times
you can't be actually

00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:17.520
inside the tent
most of the time.

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:20.260
Quite often you have to be
outside looking at everything

00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:22.340
to make sure the
tents don't blow away.

00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:24.600
So again, it's nice to
be in a comfortable tent

00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:25.480
when it's in a storm.

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:27.750
On the other hand, you don't
want your gear to blow away

00:56:27.750 --> 00:56:29.050
and you don't want your
tents to blow away,

00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:31.008
so it's time to be outside
looking to make sure

00:56:31.008 --> 00:56:33.430
that it's all safe and sound.

00:56:33.430 --> 00:56:35.460
This is just sort of
the typical scenario

00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:39.040
of getting dressed out at
the dive hole and jumping in.

00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.360
You can see we're
putting on the weights.

00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:44.060
I think that's actually Alfonso
in the back helping me out.

00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:49.680
And just getting
suited up and going.

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:56.440
And then it's down through the
ice, and down to the bottom.

00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:57.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:57.910 --> 00:57:00.130
DALE ANDERSON: Yeah, it
kind of varies where it is.

00:57:00.130 --> 00:57:04.690
It depends on the part of
the season that you're in,

00:57:04.690 --> 00:57:07.090
but sometimes you can
get a free board that's,

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:10.490
what, 30 centimeters
or so Chris?

00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:12.692
So it can actually
be a fair-- That's

00:57:12.692 --> 00:57:14.900
one of the reasons we take
chainsaws out and chainsaw

00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:16.570
around the hole sometimes
to get the diver down

00:57:16.570 --> 00:57:18.760
closer to the lip of the
water, to get in and out.

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.800
It makes getting in and
out a little easier.

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.674
But these are the
microbial mats that we see.

00:57:22.674 --> 00:57:24.290
And they're just gorgeous.

00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:26.370
And again, this is the
only place on the planet

00:57:26.370 --> 00:57:29.170
that we know of where these
large conical stromatolites are

00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:31.550
forming like this.

00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:35.040
And these are all about
anywhere from a few centimeters

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:36.140
to half a meter tall.

00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:40.050
So some of these things
are almost this tall

00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:41.780
on the water, which
is pretty unusual.

00:57:41.780 --> 00:57:43.780
Most of things that you
see in most environments

00:57:43.780 --> 00:57:46.430
are the size of your finger
or a little bit bigger.

00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:48.400
Maybe the size of your hand.

00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:51.914
So this is a pretty
unique system.

00:57:51.914 --> 00:57:53.160
And I'll just stop it there.

00:58:01.382 --> 00:58:02.996
AUDIENCE: Do you
have any idea what's

00:58:02.996 --> 00:58:04.860
happening in the late
[INAUDIBLE] winter,

00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:06.763
or how it change in the winter?

00:58:06.763 --> 00:58:08.690
Or do you have any
plans to do that?

00:58:08.690 --> 00:58:09.940
DALE ANDERSON: Yeah, so
the question is do we

00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:11.520
know what's going
on in the winter?

00:58:11.520 --> 00:58:13.101
And do we have any
plans of trying

00:58:13.101 --> 00:58:14.850
to find out what's
going on in the winter?

00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:40.157
Well, we do some of that.

00:58:40.157 --> 00:58:42.740
So the biggest thing that we've
got that's out there full time

00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:43.610
is the med station.

00:58:43.610 --> 00:58:46.470
So the climate station has been
out there now for five years,

00:58:46.470 --> 00:58:49.180
and we've got a really nice,
long five year data set.

00:58:49.180 --> 00:58:51.270
And in fact, that's
the reason I came out

00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:53.230
was to work on that
data set with Chris,

00:58:53.230 --> 00:58:55.180
to publish a paper for it.

00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:57.987
So that's the most important
thing that we leave right now.

00:58:57.987 --> 00:59:00.070
There are some underwater
sensors and some devices

00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:01.790
that we'd like to
leave underwater,

00:59:01.790 --> 00:59:03.710
but we haven't pulled that off.

00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:05.424
So that might be in the future.

00:59:05.424 --> 00:59:07.090
It's a little more
difficult to do that.

00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:09.640
And of course we have to ensure
that we get back every year,

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:12.180
or every so often
to get the data.

00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:14.733
And that's another part
of the story too is,

00:59:14.733 --> 00:59:16.940
you know, maintaining
funding, and trying

00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:18.879
to get the funding
to keep us going,

00:59:18.879 --> 00:59:20.670
and to get those tools
to leave underwater.

00:59:25.337 --> 00:59:27.920
AUDIENCE: How long does it take
to drill a hole with the coil?

00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:30.050
Can you show it to us
on the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:30.780
DALE ANDERSON: So
how long does it

00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:32.970
take to make a dive hole
with one of the coils?

00:59:32.970 --> 00:59:34.650
Well, a flat coil,
again, it depends

00:59:34.650 --> 00:59:35.880
on how thick the ice is.

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:39.380
If it's 2 and 1/2
meters versus 6 meters

00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:41.490
it'll obviously be
a big difference.

00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:44.030
But in general we can
count on a day or two,

00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:46.950
or maybe up to three
days to make a hole.

00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:49.546
By the time we get it all
set up, and we open it up,

00:59:49.546 --> 00:59:51.420
and water floods and
comes up to the surface,

00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:52.350
and the hole's ready.

00:59:52.350 --> 00:59:56.316
So it's a couple
of days at least.

00:59:56.316 --> 00:59:58.232
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
concerned about doing it

00:59:58.232 --> 01:00:00.395
on a lake [INAUDIBLE]?

01:00:00.395 --> 01:00:01.270
DALE ANDERSON: It is.

01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:04.040
It's a real concern of ours.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.904
It's like anything.

01:00:05.904 --> 01:00:07.320
Any time you study
anything you're

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.195
going to change the
environment a little bit.

01:00:09.195 --> 01:00:11.050
So you try to
minimize that change.

01:00:11.050 --> 01:00:13.329
And one thing that
we do is, just

01:00:13.329 --> 01:00:15.870
for example, everything that we
bring into the field with us,

01:00:15.870 --> 01:00:17.910
everything, goes back out.

01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:19.340
So all of our waste
goes back out.

01:00:19.340 --> 01:00:20.994
We collect all human waste.

01:00:20.994 --> 01:00:23.410
All the grey water that we
produce, all trash, everything.

01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:24.830
That goes in and out with us.

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:28.480
For working in the lake itself,
over the years in the McMurdo

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:31.090
Dry Valleys we've wrestled
with this problem as well

01:00:31.090 --> 01:00:34.130
and have come up with
suggestions and techniques that

01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:35.400
help minimize that as well.

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.365
And part of that is keeping
the gear extremely clean

01:00:38.365 --> 01:00:40.300
to make sure that we
don't transfer organisms

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:43.670
from system to
system for example.

01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:46.710
Our impact is really pretty
minimal through these lakes.

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:49.470
Our scale is so much smaller
than the volume of water

01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:51.040
that we're working in.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.135
And again, we try
to minimize anything

01:00:53.135 --> 01:00:54.760
that we do that would
disrupt anything.

01:00:59.551 --> 01:01:01.800
AUDIENCE: Do you have to
re-open the holes every year,

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:02.720
or do they stay closed up?

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.261
DALE ANDERSON: Yeah,
they'll close up

01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:08.640
over a period of weeks to months
they'll freeze shut again.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.580
So every year we have
to open up a hole.

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:13.279
And depends on
when you're there.

01:01:13.279 --> 01:01:15.320
If you're working in the
Dry Valleys for example,

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.912
in October or November,
a few days can pass,

01:01:17.912 --> 01:01:20.120
and you'll have to go back
out and chip the hole out,

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:23.040
or chainsaw it out, depending
on how long you've left it.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.132
But after a week you can
count on pretty thick ice

01:01:25.132 --> 01:01:26.090
being back in the hole.

01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:35.890
BORIS: All right.

01:01:35.890 --> 01:01:37.250
That's all the questions.

01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:41.880
So please join me
in thanking him.

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:43.380
DALE ANDERSON: Thank you.

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:45.230
Thank you.
