It would be marvelous if
everyone here could just

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.940
take the moment to silence
any electronic devices you

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.320
may have brought with you.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.250

by bringing renewed
attention and new technology

to bear on Native American
life and the intersections

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.140
with colonial settlers and
Europeans during this period.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.200

[APPLAUSE]

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.650
PHILIP DELORIA: So
I'm going to with I

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.650
think that's something
that's appropriate for us

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.140
to do whenever we
gather together.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.360
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:03:45.622 --> 00:03:46.330
I'm Phil Deloria.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.170
I'm coming to you from Harvard.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.850
My family comes from the
Yankton people in South Dakota.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:55.070
We're gathered
together this evening

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.260
on the ancestral territory
of the Massachusetts people.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.260
Many indigenous communities
have lived and moved

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.550
to this place over time.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.640
And so we recognize also the
Wampanoag and Nipmuc people

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.260
among others.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.750
And it's worth our recognition
that indigenous people

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.200
from many nations live and
work in this region today.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.300
So I ask you to join
with us in acknowledging

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.300
their communities, paying
respect to their elders past

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.390
and present, and recognizing
their active presence

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.020
and their futurity reposed
in the generations present

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.630
and to come.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.360
So what I've just done
is a land acknowledgment.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.130
It's something that
happens in Canada.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.922
It's something that
happens in New Zealand.

00:04:32.922 --> 00:04:35.150
It's something that
happens in Australia.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.400
And increasingly, it's
happening in the United States.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.220
And it's part of, I
think, a general sense

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.050
that we need to think
hard about the land

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.590
that we're on and to recognize
the people who still have ties

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.070
to that land or who are still
here in relation to that land.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.360
Native people make up about
1.5%-1.7% of the American

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.500
population.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.903
It's according to
the last census.

00:04:56.903 --> 00:04:58.820
And I think one of the
things that those of us

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.122
who study native people, and
care about native people,

00:05:02.122 --> 00:05:04.760
and are affiliated and
committed to native people

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.830
understand is that native
people get about 1.5%

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.860
of our collective
attention or maybe less.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.300
And this is actually not right.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.870
It's not right in relation to
the various structures on which

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.480
the nation is built. It's
not right in relation

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.640
to the policies,
and to the laws,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.000
and the legal structures that
are part of the United States

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.020
today.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.350
And so part of our effort, I
think as scholars and as people

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.450
who study these
things, is to think

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.900
hard, and hopefully with
you, about how we actually

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.800
bring more than 1.5%
attention to native people.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.450
As we were talking
before we went on,

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.740
Collin mentioned that land
acknowledgments at Dartmouth

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.380
have become a bit more of
an important kind of thing.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.880
And I wonder if we
might start Colin

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.390
with you sort of reflecting
about what those things do

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.970
for us, what they mean,
how they function,

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.800
why they are important,
how they connect up

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.317
to the sort of histories that
we're talking about today?

00:06:00.317 --> 00:06:01.650
COLIN CALLOWAY: Of course, yeah.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.790
For those of you who are
not familiar with Dartmouth,

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.380
Dartmouth was founded
in 1769 ostensibly

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:14.330
as a school for the education
of Native Americans.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.990
Didn't do terrifically well in
that regard up until 1970 when

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.260
the college recommitted
itself to the education

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.580
of Native Americans.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:28.670
And since 1970, I
think our Native alumni

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.290
now number in excess of 1,100
from every tribe from Abenaki

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.280
to Zuni.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.220
And every class I have
has Native students in it.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.400
So Dartmouth, one would hope,
would be a little bit more

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.110
sensitive to these issues.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:43.730
And I think it is.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:46.400
The Hood Museum at
Dartmouth, which has recently

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:52.070
reopened after being closed and
renovated over a couple years,

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.280
has included in
its architecture,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.420
if you like, a
land acknowledgment

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:03.140
statement recognizing that the
museum and Dartmouth College

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.770
sits on Abenaki homeland.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.570
And not only that,
but it mentions

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:13.170
that this is unceded land
because the Abenaki did not

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:17.500
make treaties in New
Hampshire and Vermont.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.040
And that raises a question.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.830
But people have
asked about that.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.440
Well, why do this?

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.180
Is it just a matter of respect?

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.610
Is it just a formality?

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.970
And certainly it's
a matter of respect.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:36.600
But I think from my perspective,
non-native perspective

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.750
but as a historian
studying this continent,

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:43.260
it does matter because
whatever else it does,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:49.170
it's a reminder to us of the
bottom line, as I see it.

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:53.830
And that is that this is a
nation built on Indian land.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.700
And that is not
revisionist history.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.682
That's actually just a fact.

00:08:00.682 --> 00:08:04.250
In 1491, it was all
Native American land.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.360
And now most of it is not.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.370
And I use that not
so much as introduce

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:19.630
let's all feel good or guilty
about everything but rather

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:23.470
as a basis for rethinking
American history.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.958
When I teach and write about
Native American history,

00:08:27.958 --> 00:08:30.250
I'm conscious of the fact
that I'm not Native American.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:31.667
When I teach
American history, I'm

00:08:31.667 --> 00:08:33.339
conscious of fact
I'm not an American.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.360
So what I can bring to the
study of Native American history

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.299
is not insights from
tribal culture--

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:46.390
I'd be foolish and
presumptuous to try and say

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.650
that was the case--

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:54.580
but rather to look at American
history with Native Americans

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:56.250
not ignored--

00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.120
as Phil suggested--
but included.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.200
And increasingly over the years,
I've become convinced that we

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.540
cannot understand American
history without Native

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.750
Americans in it.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.370
So even writing and teaching
Native American histories

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.970
is more than just
showing respect,

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:21.850
perhaps delayed recognition
to native people.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:23.950
It also matters
to the rest of us

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.320
because we all live
on this continent.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.280
And we deserve a
better understanding

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.000
of how things came
to be they were,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.670
and how the history of
this continent unfolded.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.360
Lots of things don't happen
without Native Americans.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.250
There are lots of
things that make

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:47.510
no sense if Native
Americans are not included.

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:50.190
And yet, very often I
think in our history,

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.450
it's written and told as
if that were not the case.

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:56.910
And so what we're left
with, I think sometimes,

00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:00.180
is what Ralph Waldo
Emerson referred to

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.190
as a shallow village tale.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.680
Great nations deserve
great history.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.770
And that needs to be
much more inclusive

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:11.300
than a lot of the things that--

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:15.710
certainly I grew up
reading and read last week.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.210
PHILIP DELORIA: So
one of the things

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.627
I think that's interesting
about the work that both of you

00:10:19.627 --> 00:10:22.910
do is that you're both
engaged with the revision

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.917
or the complication or
the telling of new stories

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:28.000
relative to some of the
stories that are familiar.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.320
And I wonder if each of
you might take a moment--

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.480
and Julia, maybe we
should start with you--

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.880
and sort of tell us about
sort of the classic narrative

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.050
and about the ways that your
work actually transforms this.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.193
So some of your really
interesting archeological work

00:10:43.193 --> 00:10:45.110
in Virginia, it feels
to me, has the potential

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.330
to completely change around
some of the narratives

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:48.770
that we think we know
about the Powhatan

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:50.030
Confederacy and other things.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.405
And I wonder if
you might reflect

00:10:51.405 --> 00:10:52.460
with us about that a bit.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.030
JULIA A KING: Sure.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.010
I'd love to do that.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:57.350
And I want to say to your point
about the colonial history

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.380
is that colonial history
is Native American history.

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:03.860
And it took me a long
time to get there

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.003
through graduate school.

00:11:06.003 --> 00:11:06.920
It just wasn't taught.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:11.330
It was sort of this
void that was not

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:15.110
filled until I started to really
work in Maryland and Virginia.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:19.490
And of course, I met a lot of
Native or indigenous people.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.910
And the Native story is
often missing in museums

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:26.120
or it's segregated in this
museum or that museum.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.330
It's not integrated.

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.630
And there's real
problems with that.

00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:33.290
At the same time, even as we're
adding the Native American

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:36.300
component to the colonial
history component--

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:40.070
which we should do and not
just add, but integrate--

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.227
my work with Native
Americans has revealed--

00:11:42.227 --> 00:11:43.310
and I'm not Native either.

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:46.140
So I always feel, you know, I
don't want to be presumptuous--

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:51.200
but what I've heard repeatedly
is we did not start--

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:57.680
our history did not start in
1492 or 1565 or 1607 or 1620

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.650
or wherever you happen to be.

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.120
It started thousands
of years before.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.480
And that's where archeology
can come in and play a role.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.830
[COUGH] Excuse me.

00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:14.600
And archeology, most people
who train in archeology

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.510
are trained in departments
of anthropology.

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:20.690
My background is both in
anthropology history and--

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.940
not both-- but and
also American Studies

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:28.700
or American civilization and
a very cross-disciplinary,

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.933
interdisciplinary, way
to think about the world.

00:12:31.933 --> 00:12:33.350
And one of the
things I've learned

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:35.360
about working with
Native histories

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.200
is how local you often
have to really be.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.560
You know, Native Americans, we
sort of put them all together

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.350
as Native Americans, but
they're highly variable

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:46.980
and very different.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:53.980
And it varies across counties,
not just across regions.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.730
And some of the work
that we've been doing

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:58.003
in Maryland and Virginia--

00:12:58.003 --> 00:13:00.170
because we're archeologists
and we're very concerned

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:04.850
with objects, and context,
and the materiality of life--

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.970
we've been working with things
like geographical information

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:09.890
systems, GIS.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:13.280
And I have people
on my staff who

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.850
can do that a lot better
than I can but together we

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:21.020
can put that information,
we can download--

00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.160
what we call big data.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.530
You've maybe heard
that phrase big data.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.020
And we can put that
information along

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:33.230
with oral history, documentary
information, modern day life

00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:35.930
ways information
and put it in there.

00:13:35.930 --> 00:13:38.720
And a lot of people
use GIS to store data

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.770
but you can also put
it through its paces.

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.320
And some of the
things that we have

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:48.290
found in working in Virginia is
with the Powhatans is at this--

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.690
and I realize it's a long
way to get to the answer

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:55.850
to your question-- but the
Powhatans occupy a huge place

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.100
in our national narrative.

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:05.000
And in Powhatans or
[INAUDIBLE] almost every child

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.660
knows the story of Pocahontas.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:13.710
And if you look at
Captain John Smith's map

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:17.340
from the early 17th century
that mapped the Chesapeake,

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:21.150
you'll see that he puts
Powhatan way up into Maryland.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:24.600
And people began to realize
early on that that was not

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.920
the case.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.830
But they put Powhatan to
about the Potomac River.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:34.950
And part of this is you would
see these towns, these nations,

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.430
on the north side of a river,
for example, the Rappahannock

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:39.840
River in particular.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:45.120
And the notion was that
they had put space between--

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.640
put the river between
themselves and Powhatan because

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.390
of the long powerful
arm of Powhatan

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.900
and really created this
narrative that we now realize

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.315
has just got to be relooked at.

00:14:58.315 --> 00:14:59.940
The reason that people
are on the north

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:02.460
side of the river in
many of these cases

00:15:02.460 --> 00:15:05.760
is that's where the good soils,
the marshlands, the access

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:11.430
to the waterways, where those
ecological variables occur

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:11.940
together.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:15.060
They tend not to occur
together on the south side.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.070
So it's actually an ecological
and not a political reason

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:22.020
that the people are
on the north side.

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:24.430
And if you really start
to drill down into it,

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.170
you find out that the
Virginians especially

00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:28.920
are talking about
Powhatan because they're

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.200
right there in his country.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:36.040
And so he's going to loom
very large in their view.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:42.900
But in fact, GIS is helping
me understand that we really

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.120
don't know as much
as we think we

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.290
do because we have invested so
much in these early writings.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.360
And I'm not suggesting
that these early writings

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.490
are worthless, not at all.

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:56.580
It's just that there are
other pieces of evidence

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.097
that we can bring to bear on
looking at these questions.

00:16:00.097 --> 00:16:01.680
PHILIP DELORIA: I
mean as a historian,

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.420
it's always nice to
work with archeologists

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.545
and find the ways that
archeologists can complicate

00:16:05.545 --> 00:16:09.420
our engagements with
sources, and particularly

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.790
the sort of interesting
methods that archeologists

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:12.890
bring to bear.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:15.053
So what I'm hearing you
say is we might imagine,

00:16:15.053 --> 00:16:17.220
you know, there's a familiar
story about Pocahontas.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:18.840
Oh, she falls in
love with John Smith

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.250
and the kind of Disney version.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.500
And then there's a more
complicated historical version

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.700
that we all might have engaged.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:23.830
Right?

00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:24.930
We say no, no, no.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:26.370
This was a diplomatic ritual.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:27.360
This was a ceremony.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.410
This was something.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:31.020
But even that story is
premised on the notion

00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:34.170
that the Powhatan Confederacy
is this massive kind

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.698
of looming sort of
political entity

00:16:36.698 --> 00:16:37.740
that's sort of out there.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.120
And it feels to me like
one of the things you're

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.980
suggesting with
your work is perhaps

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:42.508
that might be
shrunk a little bit.

00:16:42.508 --> 00:16:44.550
And perhaps the Rappahannocks
might be increased.

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.350
And what would it
mean for us to change

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:49.900
the political geography of
that portion of the Eastern

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:50.400
seaboard?

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.598
And that feels
applicable, perhaps then,

00:16:52.598 --> 00:16:53.640
to other sorts of things.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.060
Am I reading it right?

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.940
JULIA A KING: Exactly, yeah.

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:00.820
And in fact, the Rappahannock
do not loom large.

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.750
But if you look at some of the--

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.310
this opens up these
other questions

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:09.569
or these other historical
facts and archeological facts.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.819
And you start to
realize, wow, they

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:15.359
do seem that there is a big
story there that's just been--

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:18.000
for over 100 years--

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.152
kept under wraps.

00:17:19.152 --> 00:17:20.819
PHILIP DELORIA: So
Colin, I wonder if we

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:23.045
might turn to you because--

00:17:23.045 --> 00:17:25.170
I'm going to hold the book
up and encourage you all

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:26.998
to go to the bookstore.

00:17:26.998 --> 00:17:29.290
It's got a lovely cover which
we're just talking about.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:32.620
I'm a fan of it.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:34.520
And Colin's quite proud of it.

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:36.420
You know, in some
ways, Colin, book

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:40.740
might be read in the genre
of the Founding Father's

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.740
Biography the great Founding
Fathers biography of the Ron

00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:48.600
[INAUDIBLE],, David McCullough,
Joe Ellis kind of mode.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:52.560
These may be works that some
of you may be familiar with.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:55.080
But as I kind of worked
through the book,

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.290
it feels to me
like it's not that.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.790
And I'm wondering if you might
talk, then, a little bit more

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:03.210
about what is your
central claim here?

00:18:03.210 --> 00:18:06.480
How does putting Indians
in American history

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.760
change the nature of our
understanding of sort

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.430
of the genre of Founding
Father biography

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:15.240
and of the story that we tell
about the early Republic?

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:20.260
COLIN CALLOWAY: So I've written
a lot of books, I suppose.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:22.680
And usually when I
publish a book, people go,

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.740
hmm, OK, and start it out slow
and fizzle out altogether,

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.550
I suppose.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.560
But this was Washington, right?

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:33.580
And as soon as people knew I
was writing a book about George

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.400
Washington, suddenly I
had offers of contracts

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.730
and all kinds of
attention, et cetera,

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:43.330
which was a bit of a surprise
but not entirely unexpected

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:48.430
because my thinking in writing
this book was quite strategic.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.760
I did have an agenda.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.390
Actually, it hadn't
been out long

00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:54.673
when I got an email from
a gentleman who said

00:18:54.673 --> 00:18:55.840
I've been reading your book.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.882
And I stopped reading it.

00:18:56.882 --> 00:18:59.410
Why would you want to make
George Washington look bad?

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:01.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:04.180
And I assured him, and I assure
you, that was not the purpose.

00:19:04.180 --> 00:19:05.620
But I did have an agenda.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:10.510
And this was quite tactical.

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.070
I've been doing
this a long time.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:14.980
And people like Phil and
myself and our colleagues

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.030
have been doing this
an awful long time.

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.420
And part of what
you hope is that you

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:25.580
will change, if you like, the
popular narratives a little bit

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.440
and see your work
filtering down.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:32.270
But I think we still find
that has limited effect.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:37.310
And so my thinking was I've
been saying this for a long time

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:43.640
that we need to include Indian
people in American history

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.740
to understand American history.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:49.700
What better way to do that
than to take, if you like,

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.540
the most famous American,
an icon of American history,

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:57.530
and show how Native America
and Native American people

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.830
shaped the life of the
man who shaped the nation.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:05.300
And so it's sometimes
called a biography.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.040
I never thought of
it as a biography,

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:13.850
although Washington's life
gives us a natural structure.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:18.700
And as Julia's was
talking, and as I

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.040
have been reading Julia
over the last few days,

00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.810
the work she's done
is fascinating.

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.690
And I'm thinking it's far more
fascinating than what I do.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:28.400
I'm just a historian.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.200
I read documents.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.460
But I think that's the point.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:32.450
You can do this.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:36.080
I grew up when reading
Indian history-- when

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.270
Indian history was out West.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:40.770
Right?

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.090
It was cavalry and Indians.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:45.120
And then when it started
to become serious,

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.660
it was United States
policy for Indian people.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:53.970
And then it became what we
call ethnohistory which sounded

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.710
more complicated than it was.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.320
It was basically if you're
going to study people's history,

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.900
you should try and
study their history

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.360
in the terms they would have
experienced and understood

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.250
that history.

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:06.810
That to me is history.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:10.590
Why would you do
any other than that?

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:16.380
But I don't think I'm doing
anything very complicated.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:19.890
For a lot of times,
I've read historians

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:21.810
who said you
actually can't really

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:28.090
do Indian history because they
didn't produce any records.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.030
Well, that's nonsense
to begin with.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:34.450
There's all kinds of ways in
which Native people recorded

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:38.080
history and preserved
their history with care.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.990
But even in Great Britain
records, there's tons of stuff

00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.490
there.

00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:45.850
Part of the reason I
was able to do this book

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.770
was because of the
tremendous work

00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:50.050
that people on the Papers
of George Washington

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:52.300
and other Founding
Fathers have done

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:56.050
in collecting all those papers,
digitizing them, et cetera.

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:59.260
I challenge anybody to read
through the Papers of George

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:04.560
Washington and not come
away with the impression

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:08.110
that Indians mattered
and really mattered.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:10.630
He spends a lot of time
talking about them,

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:13.830
thinking about them, meeting
in his Cabinet about him.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:17.940
And his life is shaped
in important ways.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.650
Phil mentioned that
little book I wrote

00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:21.360
called Victory with No Name.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.930
It's called that because it's
called St. Claire's defeat.

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.120
An American general
lost this battle.

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.670
He lost this battle because
an Indian Confederacy

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:33.070
won this battle.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.760
And in doing so they
destroyed the only army

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.890
the United States had
in 1791 when the United

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:42.920
States is 15 minutes old.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:47.080
And nobody's sure if
it's going to survive.

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.840
And the reason I wrote that
book was because nobody

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.490
had written that book.

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:55.510
Hundreds of books on the Battle
of Little Big Horn and General

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:58.540
Custer, but why nothing on this?

00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:02.050
Not just because it matters
as an important event

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:04.960
in Indian history,
but it surely matters

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.870
to give us a better
understanding of what

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.390
the young Republic was like.

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:13.180
And everywhere I looked
in Washington's life

00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:15.310
there were examples like that.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:18.700
Things like the first
invocation of what we might now

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:24.100
call executive
privilege happens first

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:28.060
in the wake of St.
Claire's defeat

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.070
when the first
congressional investigation

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:34.180
committee says we're going
to find out what happened.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:38.080
This defeat happened because of
contractor fraud, as American

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.147
as apple pie.

00:23:39.147 --> 00:23:40.480
We're going to follow the money.

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.800
Where will the money lead?

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.330
We know where it's
going to lead.

00:23:43.330 --> 00:23:45.413
It's going to go to the
Secretary of the Treasury.

00:23:45.413 --> 00:23:46.000
Who is that?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.375
Alexander Hamilton.

00:23:47.375 --> 00:23:50.390
It wasn't like now,
everybody hated back then.

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:52.870
And so that was
the investigation.

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:54.020
And they asked for--

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:54.970
we want the documents.

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:56.320
We want the papers.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.000
Washington huddled
with his Cabinet,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.360
because as first president he
knew he was setting precedent.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:03.610
And they said, yeah, you've
got to give up the papers.

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:06.460
But you should
withhold those that

00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:10.420
might be seen as detrimental
to the public interest

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.170
if you release it.

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.350
It's because of Indians.

00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:18.990
So it's not simply about
injecting new players

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:21.720
into the story, although
it surely is that,

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:25.320
but looking at ways in which
Native American presence

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.210
and power--

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:29.840
because we know
how the story ends.

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:33.850
Or, it hasn't ended, but we
know where we've gotten to.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:36.700
And we think of
Native American people

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:40.070
as defeated and powerless.

00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:42.680
Not in Washington's lifetime.

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.400
Indian people controlled
most of the continent.

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:49.610
And Indian power was something
that George Washington

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:50.870
had to reckon with.

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:55.150
So in my answer to my
email correspondent,

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:59.690
I said, even if you regard
Washington as the greatest

00:24:59.690 --> 00:25:04.690
president ever, isn't one
attribute of his greatness

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:11.730
is dealing with this
reality of Native power

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.010
that threatens the
young Republic?

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.210
And nobody's talking about it.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:20.490
And I think people are
not talking about it not

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:23.820
because it's generations
of historians

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.760
have been lazy and not
gone through the records.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.790
But I think they've been going
through the records interested

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:32.640
in other subjects and
asking different questions.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.320
So I think really
all that I've done

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.200
is spend my life going
through written documents

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:41.960
where Indian people
are not supposed to be

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.420
and finding Indian
people everywhere.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:48.770
My first experience of this
was as a graduate student,

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:50.870
in England, when
my supervisor who

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:54.770
knew nothing about Native
Americans said go to London.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:56.270
Come back when you
found something.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:26:00.170
So I started working through the
records of the British Indian

00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:03.080
Department and the
National Archives,

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.870
as it is now, Public Record
Office then and the British

00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:07.630
Library.

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:10.990
And I thought I was
never going to get out

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:14.850
of there because
those guys took down

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:22.230
verbatim every speech that
Indian spokesmen, leaders,

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:23.190
said.

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:25.420
And I was just
there months after--

00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:27.828
I was sleeping on my
brother's floor in Wimbledon.

00:26:27.828 --> 00:26:30.120
So I was conscious of how
long I was going to be there.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:30.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.430
And it seemed like I
would be there forever.

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:35.930
And actually, I think
I could have been.

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:40.070
Native Americans everywhere
in the written records.

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:43.080
And that's where
I'm trained to work.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.570
That's where I work.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:47.425
And all you have to do, I
think, is look for them.

00:26:47.425 --> 00:26:48.800
PHILIP DELORIA:
As historians, we

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.930
know that it's not just the
British Colonial Archives,

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:51.430
right?

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:53.120
But the United States
Record Group 75

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:56.360
in the National Archives
is a massive trove

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.757
of documents,
bureaucratic documents,

00:26:58.757 --> 00:26:59.840
that just goes on forever.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:02.630
And you actually have to
have a lot of expertise.

00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:04.080
You can't do this by yourself.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.350
You need an archivist to
kind of walk you through it.

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:08.696
Pitch for the National
Archives, by the way.

00:27:08.696 --> 00:27:12.680
[APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER]

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.120
I mean that, though, actually.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:16.655
I mean I will shout out
Mary Frances Morrow who

00:27:16.655 --> 00:27:18.530
is the archivist who I
have worked with there

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.920
and has been the most
wonderful and helpful person

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.790
because these are
very, very complicated

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:25.015
and copious sorts of records.

00:27:25.015 --> 00:27:26.390
Colin, I wonder
if you might sort

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:28.580
of-- so you mentioned
Washington in terms

00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:33.440
of being shaped by the existence
of this Indian power that

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.130
sits out there.

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:35.630
And it's with us
remembering, right?

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:39.230
It takes 400 years, lots
of epidemic disease, lots

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:42.200
of violent military conflict
to actually bring Indian people

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.760
under the control of Europeans.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.480
It doesn't happen easily at all.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:45.980
Right?

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:47.213
So that power is there.

00:27:47.213 --> 00:27:48.630
It's constituted
and reconstituted

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:50.620
in all kinds of different ways.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:54.320
And it's persistent.

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.570
So you sort of mentioned
Washington's awareness

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.820
of this power and the
ways in which he governs

00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.970
relative to its existence.

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:03.080
And one of things that's
striking about the book

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.570
is the many occasions on
which Washington actually

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:07.940
has direct contact
with Indian people.

00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.652
Here's a dinner
with Little Turtle.

00:28:09.652 --> 00:28:11.360
And then, oops, three
days later, there's

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.740
another dinner with the Creeks.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.990
And all of a sudden here's
Alexander MacGillivray.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:19.670
And some part of this
is him as a president

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:20.810
and an administrator.

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:23.390
Some part of it is him as a
young person and a surveyor.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:25.970
Some part of it is him
as a military officer.

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:28.940
I wonder if you might pick one
episode of Washington's life

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:34.128
that you think it bears
repeating or us thinking

00:28:34.128 --> 00:28:36.170
about in relation to sort
of the character of him

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:38.360
and who he becomes
and how he becomes.

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:41.620
Is it his experience as a
surveyor out there on the edge?

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.880
Is it his experience
with Braddock?

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.370
Is it his failures
in the early going?

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:48.920
Is at his experience as
a town destroyer, a name

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.050
that's actually in his family--

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:53.442
interesting tidbit
I did not know--

00:28:53.442 --> 00:28:54.650
during the Revolutionary War?

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:56.870
Is there a particular moment
that sort of jumps out

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:59.853
at you in Washington's life?

00:28:59.853 --> 00:29:01.520
COLIN CALLOWAY: Well,
one of the moments

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.840
that did jump out at me.

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.720
I'm not sure that it's
a pivotal moment where

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.150
you were referring to dinners.

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:13.430
I think it's the last week
of November 1796, I think.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.430
George Washington as
President has dinner

00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:18.578
on four different
days because they

00:29:18.578 --> 00:29:20.120
used to have dinner
in the afternoon.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.950
He has dinner on
four different days

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:27.220
with four different Indian
delegations to Philadelphia.

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:32.500
So if you visit Philadelphia
and go to the old city,

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.965
it's not that huge.

00:29:34.965 --> 00:29:36.340
You couldn't walk
down the street

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:40.180
without bumping into
Native American delegation.

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.880
And that was not, I think,
because George Washington

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.160
necessarily liked having
dinner with Native Americans

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.240
but he recognized
the importance of it.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.070
And in fact, on one
of those occasions,

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:53.160
he said to Henry Knox
tell interpreters

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.120
don't talk about land.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.780
Right?

00:29:56.780 --> 00:30:00.330
Because he knew that they knew
that he was interested in land.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:02.370
And Washington, rather
than a single moment--

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:05.430
if I looked for a single
thread running through

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:06.960
Washington's life--

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.670
I'd say it was land.

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:12.170
As a young man, he
started out as a surveyor.

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:15.530
He constantly looked at
land as a surveyor would.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:21.940
He recognized Western land
as the key in the path

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.940
to his own fortune, as
the key and the path

00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:28.300
to Virginia's
future and fortune,

00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.750
and as the key and the
path towards building

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:34.270
this new nation.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:37.870
And so it's a life, in
some ways, that almost

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.460
seems obsessed with land.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:41.990
And he never calls
it Indian land.

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:44.860
He calls it land, Western land.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.970
But before I started
doing this project,

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:50.660
I read a lot of biographies of
George Washington most of which

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:55.260
said very little about
Indians or Native America.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:57.530
But what I started doing
was mentally going through

00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:01.250
and every time they said Western
land or land, either adding

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:03.410
or inserting Indian
land, I said, ah,

00:31:03.410 --> 00:31:06.050
the whole book's about Indians.

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:11.750
Because I said this is a
nation built on Indian land.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:15.170
That might sound sort of
radical to some people.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:16.460
Washington said that.

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.050
Washington knew that.

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:20.990
This was Washington's
plan for the nation.

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:25.970
He understood that without
expanding onto Indian land,

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:28.670
the United States would
amount to nothing.

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:32.720
If it remained stifled
east of the Appalachians,

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.480
it would never
achieve its power.

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:40.010
So there's that combination
which, I suppose,

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:41.950
is not unique in
American history

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:44.180
where someone's own
economic interests

00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:48.080
and the national interest
seem to come happily together.

00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:50.180
And Washington, I
think, by the time

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.600
he dies I think he has
45,000 acres of land which

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.310
wasn't the apex of his land.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:31:59.790
But he's one of the richest
landowners in America.

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:04.640
His will goes on page after
page after page about this land.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:09.270
And of course, it's land
acquired from Native Americans.

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:13.580
And I don't single Washington
out, although he was--

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.560
at a time, he's a
man of his times.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.900
Everybody is speculating
in Indian land

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.170
because that's what you did
in 18th century America.

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:25.230
It's just that Washington
was better than most,

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:28.160
more aggressive than most.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.500
But he understood this as
the path of the future.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:36.270
So even without Indian
people in the story,

00:32:36.270 --> 00:32:38.740
this is a story
about Native America.

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:42.050
And fundamental, I
believe, in the history

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:48.200
of this country is the story in
which tribal homelands become

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.530
converted to
American real estate.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:52.850
I'm not Native American.

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:56.150
But I am from a tribal
background, Highland Scots.

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:58.380
Same thing happened there.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:02.130
You take people's homelands
that have been permanent

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:04.470
where people live and die
and are tied to the lands

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:08.148
through stories and ancestors.

00:33:08.148 --> 00:33:11.060
And you dispossess
them of the land

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.420
but then you do
something more with it.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.260
You turn it into property.

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:16.160
It can be measured.

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.020
It can be bounded.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.400
It can be commodified.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.440
And it can be bought and sold.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.410
That's a fundamentally
different relationship,

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:27.970
I think, with the land
than tribal peoples--

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:28.720
and let's face it.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.580
I suppose for most
of history, people

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:32.950
have been tribal peoples--
have had with the land.

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:36.370
And that's, of course, a huge
part of the American story.

00:33:36.370 --> 00:33:41.470
And Virginia is at the forefront
of Western colonial expansion

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:44.110
and Washington's at the
forefront of Virginian

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:46.670
expansion.

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:51.070
PHILIP DELORIA: So this sense
about Indian land being sort

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:53.110
of the object of
Washington I think maybe

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:55.220
points us, Julia,
back to something

00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:57.632
you said earlier which
concerned periodization.

00:33:57.632 --> 00:33:59.590
And I think it's always
nice when archeologists

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:01.390
and historians can start
to wrangle a little bit

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:02.223
about periodization.

00:34:02.223 --> 00:34:07.870
But you struck me when you
said, look, 1492, 1607, 1620,

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:09.159
the Revolutionary War.

00:34:09.159 --> 00:34:13.500
These markers are not
necessarily as fixed.

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:15.460
They feel fixed to
us in the same way

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:17.172
that a decade seems
like it has meaning.

00:34:17.172 --> 00:34:18.880
But in fact, if we
really interrogate it,

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:20.427
it kind of doesn't, right?

00:34:20.427 --> 00:34:22.969
So I wonder if you might say a
little bit more about the ways

00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:26.860
the archeology and
historical archeology

00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:30.199
is able to press back
against these boundaries.

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:34.120
I'm thinking of an article
possibly in William and Mary

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.929
Quarterlies, I believe
by Juliana Barr,

00:34:35.929 --> 00:34:38.840
who says let's get rid of
the 1492 thing altogether.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:39.340
Right?

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:42.010
Let's imagine the same sort
of histories on this continent

00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:43.489
that we imagine in Europe.

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:45.850
And I wonder if you might
reflect with us a bit more

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:48.730
about that kind of
approach as a way of,

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:52.034
like Colin sort of calling our
histories into question a bit.

00:34:52.034 --> 00:34:53.409
JULIA A KING:
Well, archeologists

00:34:53.409 --> 00:34:55.150
love to come up
with periods, too.

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:58.400
So the historians don't have
the corner on that market.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.300
I do want to mention
about the town destroyer.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:03.050
And in fact that event--

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:07.000
and I don't know that they've
actually found the record where

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.590
John Washington-- who was the
great grandfather of George--

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:16.150
came into Maryland and
actually put a Susquehanna Town

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:20.770
under siege and then dealt
with the Susquehanna leaders

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:23.980
very unfairly, called
them out for a parlay,

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.090
and then executed them.

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:30.030
And supposedly, that's
where the name comes from.

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:32.530
To go back to the
idea of periodization,

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:37.000
I mean in some ways I think
to create periods is human.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.530
I mean that's how we catalog.

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.180
We can classify.

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:41.080
That's what we do.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:43.870
It's that, as you said,
that these are not

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:49.330
the final absolute, if
you move the bar or talk

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:51.460
about different periods.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:53.380
And I think that's
the challenge is

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:56.420
to try to conceive
of different periods.

00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:58.210
I mean, for example,
the Colonial Period.

00:35:58.210 --> 00:36:00.550
When you hear people talk
about colonial history,

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:05.590
we often think it's up
until the Revolution.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:10.090
But we really live and we still
suffer through the structures

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:13.120
of colonialism
and live in what I

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:17.650
would say is not a post-colonial
society, even if we sometimes

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:19.600
call it that.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:24.910
I do think that what archeology
can bring to the table--

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:29.200
and archeology can't
go out and find--

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.390
I mean maybe we can
go dig at Mount Vernon

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:34.690
or dig at Valley Forge and
find some of these places--

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:38.320
but we bring the
power that exists

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:45.550
between Native America
and the colonies

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:49.120
to bear through the
through everyday objects

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.810
in the archeological record.

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:55.330
There was-- and I think it was
an anthropologist, Ian Quimby,

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:57.100
back in the '40s and '50s.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:37:01.870
And he had noticed how in some
of these archeological sites

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:06.580
that these sites were supposedly
occupied by Native Americans

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:09.020
but they were all
European materials.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:12.130
And so this question became sort
of like you are what you wear.

00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:13.450
You are what you eat.

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:18.070
And that these individuals had
become European, that somehow

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:19.360
Indianness was gone.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.720
And this plays into that
trope of Indian disappearance

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:26.710
which we are always fighting
against as a country I think

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:30.910
trying to figure out where-- and
that trope starts very early.

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:33.100
It wasn't just invented
in the 20th century.

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:39.440
I mean it's used to dispossess
natives of land all the time.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:45.220
And so you know the more
we looked at some of these

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:49.210
materials-- because there are
definitely Piscataway sites,

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:53.020
Rappahannock sites, are the ones
that I've mostly worked on--

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:55.600
that are completely
they look European.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:01.330
If you didn't know where you
were and the documents weren't

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:03.040
there, they look very European.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.890
And of course, that's all
part of the dispossession.

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:10.450
Once you are forced off your
land, that native knowledge

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:15.610
that you have for good clay
sources, good food sources,

00:38:15.610 --> 00:38:16.690
that's disrupted.

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:19.630
That's the way that you
start to break things up.

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:23.620
And we see people use the
break knowledge as a way--

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:26.080
breaking knowledge as
a way of getting people

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:28.540
to do what they want.

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:32.710
So we're now able to look
at the more subtle patterns

00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:37.090
and see how there is
examples of resistance

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:41.620
in what seem like these European
archeological assemblages.

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:45.580
They could be through
beads, the colors of beads.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.350
As you drill into
the documents, you

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:49.370
start to realize that color--

00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:51.720
and again this is
recorded by Europeans.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.470
Your colleagues are
right that there's not

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:58.750
a lot there has been
recorded by Native people.

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.580
But as I tell my
students, if we wait

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.800
for the perfect data
set to come along,

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.220
we're going to be
covered in dust.

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.740
The perfect data set
will never come along.

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:10.590
But you'll find
references to colors.

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:17.530
And we can see what may be
evidence of Indian attitudes--

00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:19.540
at least in the
Middle Atlantic--

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.780
towards the
dispossession changing

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.898
in the color of bead
assemblages that

00:39:25.898 --> 00:39:27.190
are recovered from these sites.

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:30.400
Now, we've recovered
things that survive.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.250
So we recover things that
preserve, I should say,

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:34.990
in the archeological record.

00:39:34.990 --> 00:39:40.450
But embedded in these everyday
objects are the forms of power

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:44.140
that Washington was
probably working

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.060
against on an everyday basis.

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:48.310
COLIN CALLOWAY: Could I just--

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:49.750
PHILIP DELORIA: Yes, please.

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:51.370
So I wanted to talk to you two.

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:54.110
COLIN CALLOWAY: One
of the reasons why

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:56.480
I think that kind of work
Julia does is so important

00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:00.490
and the Native histories
are so important is

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:08.280
that it lengthens what's a very
short history in this country.

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:12.640
So East St. Louis
is today, there

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:20.520
was an indigenous city
from somewhere between--

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.380
probably had its
beginnings around 700 AD.

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.900
And it was gone before Columbus.

00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:30.790
But at its height, it had a
population of maybe 20,000

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:34.840
people and maybe 30,000 people
if you counted the suburbs.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.607
It was a trade center.

00:40:37.607 --> 00:40:39.190
So I always say to
my students, do you

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:42.580
think those people didn't think
it was going to last forever?

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.410
Did you think that
people in Rome

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:48.470
didn't think the empire
was going to last forever?

00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:53.440
There's a movie Patton: Lust
for Glory George C. Scott.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.030
And he's in North Africa.

00:40:56.030 --> 00:41:01.920
And he's musing about Hannibal
and the wars against Carthage

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.980
and all of this kind of thing.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:08.690
And he says, so
his mind tells him,

00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:12.050
that in Imperial Rome when a
victorious general returned

00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:14.870
to the city and had
a victory parade,

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:17.900
they put a slave in
the chariot behind him.

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:20.090
So he's walking
through the streets

00:41:20.090 --> 00:41:24.258
getting all of these accolades,
slave's whispering in his ear.

00:41:24.258 --> 00:41:25.550
Don't let this go to your head.

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:27.050
This is all temporary.

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:28.780
This will pass.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.820
And I've used that
in one of my books.

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:34.070
Good example-- I'm talking
about depth of research.

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.610
Because I think
nations need that, too.

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:40.490
That if you're top dog having
come from a nation that

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:42.740
used to think it was top
dog, if you're top dog,

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:44.660
it's not going to last forever.

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:48.240
And maybe the signs are
there that that the wheel

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.880
is going full round.

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:54.120
And I think that in
a nation which has--

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.390
even from a European
perspective-- a very short

00:41:56.390 --> 00:42:02.900
history if we only begin in
1776, or 1609, or even 1492,

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:05.760
that's a blink.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:09.450
And there's human experience
in this comment going back

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:12.500
tens of thousands of years.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.480
And if we don't think
that we've got anything

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:17.720
to learn from that,
today when we're looking

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:21.920
at the impending
crisis we deal with,

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:26.135
I think we ignore
that at our peril.

00:42:26.135 --> 00:42:28.760
PHILIP DELORIA: The case, I mean
there's a disciplinary thing I

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:30.010
think that's interesting here.

00:42:30.010 --> 00:42:32.030
Historians like to write books.

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:34.600
Archeologists kind of tend
to write more articles.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.600
I mean and this is maybe
a gross generalization,

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:39.020
but you're sort of nodding
Julia, so I'm going to take it.

00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.610
I mean is it is it the case--

00:42:40.610 --> 00:42:43.400
I mean the book requires
a long form argument.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.410
It lives in narrative.

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:46.730
It likes to tell stories.

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:48.080
It can tell grand stories.

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.820
The article tends
to be a research

00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:51.703
report on very specific
kinds of things.

00:42:51.703 --> 00:42:53.870
And I'm just wondering, it
does feel to me if we say

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:57.110
let's throw 1492 out and let's
imagine-- as Colin has said--

00:42:57.110 --> 00:42:59.190
there is a deep history
of this continent.

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:01.640
It is very much like the deep
history of Europe, right?

00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:02.810
It's completely analogous.

00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:04.970
And we shouldn't sort of
pretend that it's not.

00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:05.982
I mean how close are we?

00:43:05.982 --> 00:43:07.440
Is there an
archeologist out there?

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:08.960
Is this Charles Mann?

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.750
How close are we to having
a kind of narrative?

00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:14.540
Is it possible given the state
of archeological knowledge

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:17.510
to sort of narrate a deep
history of the continent,

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:20.430
of empires and civilizations
rising and falling

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:21.680
and different kinds of things?

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:24.180
Because I think that the way
that the story is so often told

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:27.620
is before 1492 everyone is
kind of a nomadic person.

00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:30.513
And, yeah, there's the Aztecs
and the Incas and maybe Cahokia

00:43:30.513 --> 00:43:31.430
and that's kind of it.

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:32.570
Everybody else is sort of--

00:43:32.570 --> 00:43:33.903
but that's clearly not the case.

00:43:33.903 --> 00:43:34.808
I think we know this.

00:43:34.808 --> 00:43:36.350
So how close are we
to sort of having

00:43:36.350 --> 00:43:38.690
a synthetic narrative of this?

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:40.760
Is somebody doing this?

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.550
JULIA A KING: I'm sure
that people plan it

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:46.330
as their life work to do it.

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:48.562
And I would say we do
have those in archeology.

00:43:48.562 --> 00:43:49.520
We call them textbooks.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:55.550
And they're not always
written as engagingly

00:43:55.550 --> 00:43:59.030
as some of the other books.

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:02.990
But you make a great point about
Cahokia and about what to do.

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:08.570
And it's been years since I
read it but was it the Joseph

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:09.950
Nicolar?

00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:14.520
Do you know-- where he
writes, I believe I recall.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:19.100
He writes the
history of his tribe.

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:24.590
And colonization is this
teeny blip that's not even--

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:28.190
if you're not paying
attention, you might miss it.

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:32.660
But the history of Native
people on this continent

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:35.440
is, as you said,
thousands of years.

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.880
And at one point it
was 12,000 years.

00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:40.820
It's being pushed
back with sites

00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:44.630
on the east coast in
Pennsylvania and in Virginia

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:47.510
as well as more and more
archeology is getting done.

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:51.450
And there's a lot of
disciplinary structures--

00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:53.060
that I won't go into here--

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:57.620
for why maybe those grand
narrative synthesis haven't yet

00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:58.490
appeared.

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:00.980
But when they do appear,
archeologists love to step up

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:01.983
and say they're wrong.

00:45:01.983 --> 00:45:03.900
PHILIP DELORIA: That's
why it hasn't happened.

00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.080
JULIA A KING: Nobody listens to
us-- archeologists sometimes.

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:10.440
I mean I'm guilty of
saying that as well, too.

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.830
But I do think that--

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:15.980
when I was working on the book
I did about Southern Maryland

00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:19.820
I was trying to figure
out how to reimagine

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.830
and invited the
Piscataway people

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:24.680
to reimagine in St.
Mary's City which

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:30.710
was the place where the
Calvert family first arrived--

00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:34.430
and which my Piscataway
colleagues would say invaded--

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:38.630
to, in that space, I gave
them some exhibit space

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:41.510
in a new building that
we had and to reimagine

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:43.960
the telling of that tail.

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:46.730
And they did in ways
that I don't know that--

00:45:46.730 --> 00:45:48.170
with my disciplinary structure--

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:49.587
I would have told
it the same way.

00:45:49.587 --> 00:45:51.500
But it was very interesting.

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:56.042
And it actually was really about
they want to make the point,

00:45:56.042 --> 00:45:56.750
we're still here.

00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:57.458
We're still here.

00:45:57.458 --> 00:45:58.520
We're still here.

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:02.360
I mean the legacy of
racism in our country--

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:07.160
and implying that Native people
disappeared a long time ago

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:12.930
or that they have a very
little bit of Native blood--

00:46:12.930 --> 00:46:16.910
whatever that means-- in
them has done such damage.

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:19.040
That I think, at least
in the Middle Atlantic,

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:25.310
I find that the 19th
and 20th century history

00:46:25.310 --> 00:46:28.140
becomes really important.

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:31.280
And yet at the same time,
they will remind you we

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:37.370
were here 12,000, 13,000,
14,000, 15,000 years ago.

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:39.470
I realize that--
just get a textbook.

00:46:41.833 --> 00:46:43.250
PHILIP DELORIA:
You know, I wonder

00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:46.610
if before we leave the
subject of archeology

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:48.650
and maybe kind of
turn a little bit back

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:50.980
to George Washington and
Indian policy, Julia,

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.022
I wonder if you might just
say a couple of words.

00:46:53.022 --> 00:46:54.800
I mean one of the things--

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:59.480
Native communities and
archeologists have not always

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:01.580
had the happiest relationship.

00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:03.980
And in many ways because
American archeology

00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:07.340
anthropology has sort of been
based on excavations which

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.830
to Native people oftentimes
looks like grave-- and in fact,

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:10.610
is--

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:12.980
grave robbing, you know?

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:16.020
So I'm wondering if
you think some of the--

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:18.020
I've been fascinated by
the new scientific kinds

00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:22.850
of technologies that seem to be,
perhaps, interestingly applied.

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:25.040
And I wonder if you feel
like that these things have

00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:27.530
the possibility to step
aside from that tension?

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:30.453
If they tend to be more
productive in that sense?

00:47:30.453 --> 00:47:32.870
And I'm thinking of things
like there was a recent thing--

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:35.480
I don't know if folks read--
about DNA studies in relation

00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:39.350
to the clay tobacco pipes
which are everywhere,

00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:43.160
actually tracking
populations that way,

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:49.558
LIDAR the kinds of things,
the sort of float thing

00:47:49.558 --> 00:47:50.100
that they do.

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:52.700
They just toss dirt into a thing
and they centrifuge it now.

00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:55.850
And all of a sudden, they can do
these incredible ethnobotanical

00:47:55.850 --> 00:47:57.200
pollen studies.

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:00.440
Applying big data methods
to limited data sources

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.830
and building algorithms to
extrapolate out from that.

00:48:02.830 --> 00:48:06.848
I mean this feels like a
new set of possibilities,

00:48:06.848 --> 00:48:07.640
a new set of tools.

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:09.080
And I'm just wondering if
you might reflect with us

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.428
a little bit on the
possibilities of those things,

00:48:11.428 --> 00:48:13.220
perhaps some of the
perils of those things?

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:15.888
If there are perils,
how it looks to you?

00:48:15.888 --> 00:48:17.930
JULIA A KING: Well, I do
think that archeologists

00:48:17.930 --> 00:48:23.220
have had a troubled
relationship with Native people.

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:25.970
And I think it came to
a head with the passage

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:29.420
of the Native American Grace
Protection and Repatriation

00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:33.830
Act, what's known as NAGPRA,
I think was in 1990 or 1991.

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:37.730
And archeologists were
really up in arms about that.

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:41.660
And it was the greatest
boon to archeologists.

00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:44.750
It forced archeologists
to come to the table,

00:48:44.750 --> 00:48:46.940
to work with Native people.

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:49.850
I think there might still
be some old school embedded

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:50.510
attitudes.

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:56.750
But I think that the more recent
generations and people working

00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:59.900
today-- because you can tell
I'm not a recent generation--

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:03.020
but that working
with Native people

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:07.130
has actually enhanced
what we've learned.

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:09.950
And it becomes this
collaborative exchange

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:11.180
back and forth.

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:13.322
The DNA is very interesting.

00:49:13.322 --> 00:49:14.780
In fact, a colleague
of mine-- that

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:18.050
came out of the Maryland
State Highway Administration.

00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:22.400
So archeology occurs
in interesting places.

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.930
And I forwarded that link
to some of the Native people

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:28.370
that I work with.

00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:30.500
And some were not sure.

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:33.660
And others were like
let's get on it.

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:35.540
So it all depends.

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:38.210
I mean, I do think that DNA--

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:40.130
it's a mystery to me.

00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:43.820
And I worry about how
it might get interpreted

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:49.850
because you don't want to see
it weaponized in the wrong ways.

00:49:49.850 --> 00:49:51.547
But there are all sorts--

00:49:51.547 --> 00:49:52.630
like I mentioned earlier--

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:59.000
GIS, LIDAR, DNA, blood
residue analysis.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:03.950
Ethnobotanical analysis
is when you recover

00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:06.680
preserved plant remains.

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:10.250
And you can get some sense
of domestication of plants

00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:12.110
or the use of wild plants.

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:17.930
I mean these things are moving
forward by leaps and bounds.

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:19.440
And we can bring them to bear.

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:22.670
And I think because of the
trusting relationships that

00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:25.310
are starting to emerge
between not just

00:50:25.310 --> 00:50:27.950
Native people but
all communities who

00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:32.750
have the scientists come in
to tell them their history,

00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:36.950
I think that we're going
to see history transform.

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:40.650
And we are seeing history
transform in different ways.

00:50:40.650 --> 00:50:43.220
So I think it's
really very exciting.

00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:47.640
And I think NAGPRA, even
though so many of my colleagues

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:50.930
feared it, is one
of the better things

00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:54.230
that have happened to
us in the last 20 years.

00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:56.480
PHILIP DELORIA: I was on an
early NAGPRA consultation.

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:59.000
And the fear was that, oh,
the Indians are backing up

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.587
semi-trucks to the institution.

00:51:00.587 --> 00:51:02.420
And they're going to
unload all of our stuff

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:04.190
and take all of our good things.

00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:06.640
A delegation came from--

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.780
this tribal nation came.

00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:13.430
The museum sort of reluctantly
pulled out maybe 200 objects,

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:14.300
laid them on tables.

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.370
The consultation
went on all day.

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:18.620
At the end of the
day, the conversation

00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:20.870
was what do we need to
have a further conversation

00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:22.550
about in terms of repatriation?

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:24.530
And it was four objects.

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:26.612
And this was
interesting in relation

00:51:26.612 --> 00:51:28.820
to what had happened over
the course of the day which

00:51:28.820 --> 00:51:31.488
is the delegation would
pick up these objects.

00:51:31.488 --> 00:51:32.780
And they would talk about them.

00:51:32.780 --> 00:51:34.880
And the museum,
realizing that there

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.310
was this incredible treasure
trove of information

00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:39.020
pulled out their pads
and their pencils.

00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.490
And they walked around
behind and what is this?

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:41.198
And what is this?

00:51:41.198 --> 00:51:41.780
What is this?

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:46.430
The utility and the value of
that Native knowledge which

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:48.530
had not gone away, which
was completely there,

00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:53.210
which was completely evoked
by the objects, was far more--

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:55.190
I mean it was almost
transcendent how

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:57.720
much information was exchanged.

00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:00.560
And that ended up being
quite a good partnership.

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.520
I think you're exactly right to
think about and point to that.

00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:09.230
Colin I wonder if
we might come back

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:11.510
around to George
Washington in terms

00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:15.410
of thinking about the ways
that Native people live and are

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:16.560
in relation to the world.

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:20.180
Some big part of that has
to do with the ways in which

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:23.170
federal Indian policy and
state Indian policies--

00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:25.740
for example with Virginia--

00:52:25.740 --> 00:52:26.698
it was actually formed.

00:52:26.698 --> 00:52:28.698
And one of the things
that was so striking to me

00:52:28.698 --> 00:52:31.250
about the book is this section
that you have about Washington

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:34.010
as a kind of early policymaker.

00:52:34.010 --> 00:52:36.193
And I wonder if you might
sort of think with us--

00:52:36.193 --> 00:52:37.860
you mentioned, for
example, the gridding

00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:39.860
and the commodification
of land, which comes out

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:43.040
of the Land Ordinance of 1785,
or the Northwest Ordinance

00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.332
which sort of lays out a
road map for territories

00:52:45.332 --> 00:52:46.040
to become states.

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:48.260
I mean these are the
foundational imperial

00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:52.010
and colonial policies that
make the United States go.

00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:53.510
So I wonder if you
might just think

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:56.150
with this a bit more, speak
a bit more about Washington

00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:58.460
as a person who develops and
is part of the development

00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:00.840
of Indian policy which
has longer lasting

00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:01.715
kinds of consequence.

00:53:01.715 --> 00:53:04.300
COLIN CALLOWAY: Yeah, yeah.

00:53:04.300 --> 00:53:06.880
Of course, because Washington's
the first president

00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:11.950
so he has a unique opportunity
to set the nation, if you like,

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:17.950
on its course in dealing
with Native Americans.

00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:22.630
And Washington is
concerned about that.

00:53:22.630 --> 00:53:24.940
I don't want to paint
a picture of him

00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:27.450
as this mindless land grabber.

00:53:27.450 --> 00:53:28.490
He's a land grabber.

00:53:28.490 --> 00:53:30.940
He's certainly not mindless.

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:33.070
Because one of the things
that he's concerned about

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:36.390
is how is this
all going to look?

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:37.320
We're a new nation.

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:40.500
We're a Republic and a democracy
on a stage full of monarchies.

00:53:40.500 --> 00:53:42.710
People are looking at us.

00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:45.590
Our own citizens will
be looking at us.

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:47.210
Posterity will look at us.

00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:53.090
He spends a lot of ink and a
lot of time worrying about this,

00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:55.780
especially writing back and
forth with Henry Knox who

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:59.150
is the Secretary of War because
Indian Affairs at the time

00:53:59.150 --> 00:54:01.130
was in the War Department.

00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:06.230
Far too much ink for me to
dismiss that as mere hypocrisy.

00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:13.030
But the bottom
line for Washington

00:54:13.030 --> 00:54:18.500
and for the United States
is we must have this land.

00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:25.400
So when the United States
wins its independence in 1783,

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:28.580
Great Britain transfers
to it everything south

00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:31.060
of the Great Lakes,
north of Florida,

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:34.110
east of the Mississippi.

00:54:34.110 --> 00:54:37.030
And they can do that because
Europeans acquire land

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:40.810
by right of discovery.

00:54:40.810 --> 00:54:42.997
You arrive some where,
you claim it by discovery.

00:54:42.997 --> 00:54:44.580
Then you can give
it to somebody else.

00:54:44.580 --> 00:54:47.190
You don't need to have Indian
people at these treaties.

00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:53.960
That's basically all
the United States has.

00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:55.810
It has nothing of an army.

00:54:55.810 --> 00:54:58.900
Its currency is-- well, we
all know about its currency,

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:01.420
not worth a nickel, right?

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:02.800
No infrastructure.

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:05.350
It's broke at the
end of this war.

00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:06.190
What does it have?

00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:07.930
All it has is this
claim to land.

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:11.140
And this land is inhabited
by Indian people.

00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:13.302
So you have to acquire
that land from them.

00:55:13.302 --> 00:55:14.510
How are you going to do that?

00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:16.090
Well, the British
had had a system.

00:55:16.090 --> 00:55:18.700
And that was
basically that you did

00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:22.580
this through formal treaties
open and above board

00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:25.360
to the extent that you
could do that so that there

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:27.550
was a legitimacy to it.

00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:29.870
And that was the preferred mode.

00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:30.370
Right?

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:31.912
We're going to have
to take this land

00:55:31.912 --> 00:55:35.470
but we should do it
fairly and honorably.

00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:40.090
And so the Northwest Ordinance
that Phil mentioned in 1787 not

00:55:40.090 --> 00:55:44.320
only sets out the territorial
system in the United States,

00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.060
basically it sets
out a blueprint

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:51.130
for national expansion
because American citizens

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:53.020
are going to move West.

00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:55.780
The territory will form as
the population increases.

00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:57.310
Eventually a state will form.

00:55:57.310 --> 00:55:59.890
And this will be an
orderly kind of procession

00:55:59.890 --> 00:56:02.670
across the country.

00:56:02.670 --> 00:56:04.390
So that's committing the nation.

00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:08.570
It's envisaging a future
built on Indian land which

00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:12.290
requires dispossessing Indian
people of their homeland.

00:56:12.290 --> 00:56:15.590
But the same ordinance
says but we will always

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:18.290
deal justly and fairly,
or honorably and fairly

00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:20.660
with American Indians.

00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:23.500
And we will never invade
them except in just

00:56:23.500 --> 00:56:25.720
and lawful was
authorized by Congress.

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:28.150
There's a phrase.

00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:30.040
So right from that
beginning, even

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:33.610
before Washington's
president, the new nation

00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:36.760
has committed itself
to national expansion

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.920
and also committed
itself to this almost

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:43.330
an inescapable contradiction.

00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:45.430
We're going to take
your land from you

00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:48.730
but we're going to deal
fairly and honorably with you.

00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:51.890
How is that going to work?

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:55.720
Because it didn't work so
well, but it remains a constant

00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:58.670
in American Indian policy.

00:56:58.670 --> 00:57:00.700
Whether it's land
or resources, it

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:04.510
continues right through
the history of the country.

00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:08.410
And Washington's
preference was that we

00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:09.850
will do the right thing.

00:57:09.850 --> 00:57:13.760
So we will offer Indian people
a fair price for their land.

00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:16.510
And we will offer them peace.

00:57:16.510 --> 00:57:19.590
And in some ways I
think he's perhaps

00:57:19.590 --> 00:57:21.180
even naive and optimistic.

00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:23.280
He kind of envisages
this as something

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:26.220
that can almost
happen naturally.

00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:30.210
That as Americans move
into Indian Territory,

00:57:30.210 --> 00:57:33.300
they'll drive the game away
so those hunting territories

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:37.470
become less valuable and Indian
people will gladly give them up

00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:38.910
to hungry American farmers.

00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:42.340
It wasn't that simple.

00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:44.430
And so when Indian
people, as they did,

00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:49.050
said thanks but no thanks,
then Washington and the United

00:57:49.050 --> 00:57:52.380
States had a problem because
you still have to have the land.

00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:57.190
And so when Washington's
writing about Indian people

00:57:57.190 --> 00:58:00.430
when confronted with those
Indian people who were not

00:58:00.430 --> 00:58:04.210
willing to give up their land,
who resist American expansion,

00:58:04.210 --> 00:58:06.010
then these people
are recalcitrant.

00:58:06.010 --> 00:58:08.650
These are the people he
refers to as savages.

00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:11.020
And these are the
people who he says must

00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:14.570
be extroverted, rooted out.

00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:17.200
So you've got-- as Jeff
Ostler describes it--

00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:24.390
Plan A which is a benevolent
American Indian policy which

00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:26.580
you should accept because
if you don't we've

00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:30.390
got Plan B. And Plan B
will be what some people

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:32.790
might call genocidal.

00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:34.800
But there is
another piece to it.

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:37.890
And that is how could
you possibly take

00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:42.800
Indian people's land and deal
fairly honorably with them?

00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:45.210
And Washington gave this
some thought and Jefferson

00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:47.490
gave it some thought
and articulated it.

00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:51.230
And, yeah, you can do this
because if you believe that

00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:57.020
Indian people are doomed to
extinction unless they adapt

00:58:57.020 --> 00:59:00.980
and adjust to this new way of
life and live like Americans--

00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:03.740
in other words
become civilized--

00:59:03.740 --> 00:59:06.770
then the best thing that
you can do for Indian people

00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:09.560
is to help them become
civilized or if necessary

00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:11.630
force them to become civilized.

00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:13.850
And they're not going
to become civilized--

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:18.110
which in late 18th or early
19th century American view

00:59:18.110 --> 00:59:21.900
means being sedentary
and farming.

00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:25.040
They're not going to do that
if they've got all this hunting

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:28.030
territory where
they can go hunting.

00:59:28.030 --> 00:59:30.950
Who would not rather spend
their time hunting deer

00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:35.690
than working from dawn
to dusk behind a plow?

00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:38.150
So now it comes into line.

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:43.320
Because by depriving Indian
men of hunting territory,

00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:45.930
you're actually
coercing them or even

00:59:45.930 --> 00:59:49.440
compelling them
to become farmers.

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:53.120
And farming requires
far less land.

00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:56.300
And so they can sell off
the excess, surplus land

00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:58.550
to American farmers.

00:59:58.550 --> 01:00:02.480
So in that-- what we might
think is almost a warped way

01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.110
of thinking--

01:00:04.110 --> 01:00:05.490
it actually works.

01:00:05.490 --> 01:00:09.180
You can civilize Indian
people out of that land.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:12.000
And that civilization
component becomes

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.500
an element of American Indian
policy from that day onwards.

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:19.050
And of course, it
leaves the United States

01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:23.640
open to these charges
of incredible hypocrisy.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:28.830
And of course, Jefferson
and Knox and Washington--

01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:29.930
they're all hypocritical.

01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:30.570
They're humans.

01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:31.770
We all are this.

01:00:31.770 --> 01:00:34.290
But I think at the
time, Washington--

01:00:34.290 --> 01:00:36.480
I see Washington
is really wrestling

01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:39.540
with this as a national issue.

01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:42.910
And I think Joe Ellis
is right on this.

01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:44.790
There's two things
that the Founding

01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:49.840
Fathers, the Revolutionary
generation, dropped the ball.

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:52.153
One was Indians and
one was slavery.

01:00:52.153 --> 01:00:54.070
And the Northwest
Ordinance, as Joe mentioned,

01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:55.680
does the same thing.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:56.810
We ban slavery.

01:00:56.810 --> 01:00:59.770
Slavery is prohibited in
the Northwest Territory.

01:00:59.770 --> 01:01:03.070
But it's permitted
south of the Ohio.

01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:08.200
Well, that maybe look like
it might be a compromise

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.170
to bide time in 1787.

01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:12.070
But what is it?

01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:15.340
Six years later, the cotton
gin's invented and cotton

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:18.370
is on the march
across the South.

01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:23.180
So these are issues that I see
these guys really wrestling

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:28.160
with and, of course, failing
to come up with a solution.

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:31.550
Because what would
that solution be?

01:01:31.550 --> 01:01:35.300
What could that look
like in a nation

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:41.762
that's predicated on a future
built on acquiring Indian land.

01:01:41.762 --> 01:01:43.970
PHILIP DELORIA: There are
these interesting moments--

01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:45.722
I'll just make one
little thing and then

01:01:45.722 --> 01:01:47.680
I think we'll turn and
open it up to questions.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:49.138
There are these
interesting moments

01:01:49.138 --> 01:01:51.700
where there does seem to be
a possibility within the sort

01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:53.200
of American political
infrastructure

01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:57.510
to imagine an Indian
polity existing within.

01:01:57.510 --> 01:02:00.280
So there is the Delaware
Treaty which says--

01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:02.780
and I think this is probably
sort of a cynical treaty,

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:04.600
but it sort of says,
oh, the Delawares,

01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:05.530
you will have your own state.

01:02:05.530 --> 01:02:07.197
And you get to be the
head of the state.

01:02:07.197 --> 01:02:09.172
And other Indians will
be subservient to you.

01:02:09.172 --> 01:02:10.630
And then, of course,
all the way up

01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:12.088
until the early
20th century, there

01:02:12.088 --> 01:02:15.310
is the possibility of an Indian
state in that place called

01:02:15.310 --> 01:02:18.160
Indian Territory that
Indian people, at least,

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:21.080
continue to take seriously
up until 1906-ish or so.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:21.580
Right?

01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:23.193
I mean so there is
a sort of sense--

01:02:23.193 --> 01:02:24.610
I think you're
right that there is

01:02:24.610 --> 01:02:26.517
a kind of a real moral
wrestling with this.

01:02:26.517 --> 01:02:28.600
And I think it's part of
the legacy of the British

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.510
who also had a certain kind
of moral wrestling with this.

01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:34.750
At the same time, it's
balanced by incredible sense

01:02:34.750 --> 01:02:38.698
of expediency that oftentimes
descends into cynicism I think.

01:02:38.698 --> 01:02:40.990
But to sort of say it's wholly
cynical, I think would--

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:41.930
I agree with you--

01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:43.197
I think that would be wrong.

01:02:43.197 --> 01:02:45.280
COLIN CALLOWAY: And I would
just to interrupt you,

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:49.390
I would just interject that
think about the importance

01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:50.620
of treaties.

01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:55.090
And so I teach a
seminar on treaties.

01:02:55.090 --> 01:02:57.400
And as I look at the
history of this country

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.950
and think about documents,
foundational documents.

01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:01.760
You've got the Declaration
of Independence

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.270
that declares the independence.

01:03:04.270 --> 01:03:06.490
You've got the
Constitution which

01:03:06.490 --> 01:03:08.770
establishes the government.

01:03:08.770 --> 01:03:12.460
And then you've got Indian
treaties that deliver the land.

01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:14.950
And without the land,
the independence

01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:17.125
and the government--

01:03:17.125 --> 01:03:20.380
part of your freedom is the
freedom to get this land--

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:23.800
and you have no nation.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.750
And so as I look at
it from the outside,

01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:31.380
there should be three
documents or sets

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:35.530
of documents that are held
in national reference--

01:03:35.530 --> 01:03:38.680
Declaration of Independence,
Constitution, and Indian

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.140
treaties.

01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:44.760
But as Phil knows only too
well, Indian treaties are not

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.700
only not accorded
that deference,

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:51.660
they are often
not even observed.

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.760
But it's a fundamental
part of it.

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:56.390
There is a neat website
that our colleague Claudio

01:03:56.390 --> 01:04:00.663
Saunt has which is called
the Invasion of America.

01:04:00.663 --> 01:04:02.580
I teach a class called
the Invasion of America

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:06.300
because it makes students
think, oh, did I miss something?

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:10.410
But you can look on there and
you can pick your location

01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:13.080
and you'll find which
treaty delivered the land.

01:04:13.080 --> 01:04:14.730
And then you watch this.

01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:15.520
It's interactive.

01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.732
You can follow this all
the way across the country.

01:04:17.732 --> 01:04:20.190
PHILIP DELORIA: You know, and
I would say Colin in relation

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:22.920
to these three, if we go to
Article VI of the Constitution,

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.240
we find three bodies of law.

01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:24.740
Right?

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:26.220
The Constitution
itself, those laws

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:27.595
which will be
passed by Congress,

01:04:27.595 --> 01:04:29.430
and the treaties which
will be made, right?

01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:30.930
I mean so this is
actually embedded.

01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:33.053
Indian people are embedded
in the Constitution,

01:04:33.053 --> 01:04:35.220
and the Three-Fifths Clause
and the Commerce Clause,

01:04:35.220 --> 01:04:37.112
and I think by
implication in Article VI.

01:04:37.112 --> 01:04:38.820
I sound like I'm a
constitutional person.

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:39.570
I'm really not.

01:04:39.570 --> 01:04:41.460
Let us open it up to questions.

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.880
Please, when you do, we
want to move through as many

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.030
as we possibly can.

01:04:46.030 --> 01:04:48.030
Try to make sure you're
asking a question rather

01:04:48.030 --> 01:04:49.288
than making a statement.

01:04:49.288 --> 01:04:51.330
Don't ask questions that
have already been asked.

01:04:51.330 --> 01:04:52.455
We all know how this works.

01:04:52.455 --> 01:04:53.990
Let's do it right, deal?

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:54.750
OK.

01:04:54.750 --> 01:04:56.430
There's microphones
here and here.

01:04:56.430 --> 01:05:01.050
And if folks would like to
step up and ask our guests.

01:05:13.607 --> 01:05:14.440
AUDIENCE: Choose me.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:14.710
All right.

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:15.920
Thank you very much for this.

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.500
It's very interesting.

01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:22.330
So President Jackson, when
he moved the Indians West,

01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:24.120
he made a statement
I believe I've

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:27.040
read that he knew that all
treaties were nonsense,

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:29.330
that they were never
going to be honored.

01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:31.720
And certainly he was in
the middle of an awful lot

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:34.690
of Indian conflict.

01:05:34.690 --> 01:05:37.150
But he wanted to move them
West to the Mississippi.

01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:40.297
Was it disingenuous of him to
think that if we move them out

01:05:40.297 --> 01:05:42.880
there-- and of course, they're
going to have all the land they

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.778
need, et cetera, to
live independently,

01:05:45.778 --> 01:05:48.070
because he was concerned that
they were going to become

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:49.780
extinct--

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:51.820
was it disingenuous
because did he really

01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:54.550
think American
expansion was going

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:57.230
to stop at the Mississippi?

01:05:57.230 --> 01:05:59.710
Do you have any
historical understanding

01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:03.648
of what his thinking
was in relation to that?

01:06:03.648 --> 01:06:04.690
PHILIP DELORIA: Go ahead.

01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:07.790
COLIN CALLOWAY: So I would say
in answer to your question,

01:06:07.790 --> 01:06:12.970
I would think "disingenuous"
was a kind word

01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:15.640
to use for it I think.

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:19.462
Well, Thomas Jefferson had
said at one point that--

01:06:19.462 --> 01:06:20.920
remember the
quotation-- that there

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.990
was enough land
between the Atlantic

01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:24.670
and the Mississippi
what to keep America

01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:28.180
going for 100 years and some
generations or something.

01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:31.540
Obviously, that didn't happen.

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:34.150
Jackson, I think, is a
different kettle of fish,

01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:37.390
although the seeds of
removal are with Jefferson.

01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:39.640
You know that you
are going to move

01:06:39.640 --> 01:06:40.900
Indian people from the land.

01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:45.610
But it's only really with the
Louisiana Purchase of 1803

01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:48.400
where you've actually got
some where to remove them to.

01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:53.890
So now you've got an alternative
if the options, as I laid them

01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:57.310
out, were you either go to
war to destroy Indian people

01:06:57.310 --> 01:07:01.600
or you civilize
them so that they're

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.520
absorbed into the society.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:06.010
Because that's the goal,
is to assimilate them

01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:08.200
so that ultimately
they will disappear.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.140
That takes time.

01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:11.650
And Americans are impatient.

01:07:11.650 --> 01:07:14.460
And people like Andrew Jackson
are even more impatient.

01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:18.990
So I think the idea of moving
people west of the Mississippi

01:07:18.990 --> 01:07:23.820
is not a permanent solution,
although they often

01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:27.690
talked about the area
west of the Mississippi

01:07:27.690 --> 01:07:30.810
for a couple of decades as
being a permanent Indian barrier

01:07:30.810 --> 01:07:34.170
because from the Canadian
border down the Gulf of Mexico,

01:07:34.170 --> 01:07:36.420
this was all Indian Territory.

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:40.220
But Indian people didn't
buy that for a minute.

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:44.730
In my treaty class,
we do a reenactment

01:07:44.730 --> 01:07:48.890
of a debate at [INAUDIBLE]
within the Cherokee Nation

01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:52.500
where the Cherokees are debating
what are we going to do.

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:54.320
We've got this nutcase
in the White House.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.010
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:56.010 --> 01:07:56.840
This is 1835.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:58.510
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:01.000
We've got this nutcase
in the White House

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.680
who's going to remove us.

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.690
And we've got the
offer of a treaty.

01:08:06.690 --> 01:08:08.920
Do we take it or not?

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:12.150
And it's really interesting
to get people into that

01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:15.840
because most people assume,
whether Native or not, well, we

01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:17.250
would have said no.

01:08:17.250 --> 01:08:19.180
But of course,
historical reality

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:21.479
is much more complicated.

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:24.770
We'll say no, but if it means my
wife and children being killed,

01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:25.920
I'm going to go.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:29.160
And if staying in Georgia
means annihilation,

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:33.330
then we'll move West and
rebuild, which is ultimately

01:08:33.330 --> 01:08:34.760
what the Cherokees do.

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.503
But those Cherokees
at that time--

01:08:36.503 --> 01:08:37.920
and, again, getting
back to what I

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:41.069
was talking about as a
historic using documents--

01:08:41.069 --> 01:08:44.550
this is a great thing to do
because by most of the Cherokee

01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:46.520
leadership are literate.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.310
They're educated.

01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:48.490
They're elite.

01:08:48.490 --> 01:08:51.960
And they're debating this
not only among themselves

01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.630
but in the Cherokee
Phoenix, a newspaper written

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:56.740
in Cherokee and in English.

01:08:56.740 --> 01:08:59.699
They're debating it by
sending memorials to Congress.

01:08:59.699 --> 01:09:02.770
They're giving lectures
in New England churches.

01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:04.210
This is part of the debate.

01:09:04.210 --> 01:09:06.960
But a fundamental
part of that question

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.420
that they wrestle
with, OK, so we've

01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:13.170
had 17 treaties with
the United States.

01:09:13.170 --> 01:09:15.390
And they've broken every one.

01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:17.880
So now we make this
treaty with the promise

01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.819
that we can go to
Oklahoma or Arkansas

01:09:20.819 --> 01:09:23.069
and be there
forever undisturbed.

01:09:23.069 --> 01:09:27.010
Do we really think that this
is what's going to happen?

01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:29.580
And so I think this
is a question not just

01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:33.180
for historians, but it was one
that Indian people at the time

01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:34.560
were wrestling with.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.600
And pretty much the
answer, of course,

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:39.390
looking particularly
at Jackson was

01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:42.620
we know that's not
likely to be the case.

01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:44.819
And of course,
given the realities

01:09:44.819 --> 01:09:49.100
of national growth
and expansion,

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.979
it wasn't going to
be the case either.

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:56.150
And Jackson-- Jackson is
not my favorite person.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:59.780
I don't see him wrestling with
a national dilemma in the way

01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:02.525
that I see Washington doing it.

01:10:02.525 --> 01:10:03.805
If that answers your question?

01:10:03.805 --> 01:10:04.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:05.888
PHILIP DELORIA:
Let's go over here.

01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:09.350
AUDIENCE: This is a question.

01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:11.580
It's a tendentious
question maybe.

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:16.130
But the land acknowledgment
that you started with I think

01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:21.560
is a very admirable gesture, but
it strikes me as a bit timid.

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.830
And I know your historians
and not policy people,

01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:26.450
but I'm interested
in the connection

01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:32.660
between that spirit of land
acknowledgment and immigration

01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:33.260
policy.

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:37.040
And I'm interested
in, what to me,

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:42.230
is the illegitimate, racial,
nationalist basis of Build

01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:43.620
the Wall.

01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:48.140
And so I also read
Russell Shorto's book.

01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:52.370
And so I understand that
the name Town Destroyer

01:10:52.370 --> 01:10:56.600
came down to George Washington
through his great grandfather

01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.570
because John Washington was
a practitioner of murder

01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:03.320
and genocide 120 years
before George Washington.

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:07.070
And that actually was
passed on by the natives

01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:08.330
through oral history.

01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:10.340
So the natives in Ohio
were aware of that

01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:13.410
when they met George Washington.

01:11:13.410 --> 01:11:15.110
And so if the foundation
of our country

01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:20.540
is in genocide, and
if that's illegitimate

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:22.730
by modern standards
of morality, does it

01:11:22.730 --> 01:11:26.090
follow that European racial
nationalism and immigration

01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:28.800
policy is not legitimate?

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:31.950
And that a legitimate
immigration policy would be

01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:33.300
the opposite of Build the Wall.

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:37.590
For instance, open borders
with immigrants-- open borders,

01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:40.560
let's say, for immigrants
with Native American blood

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:44.250
like Mexicans, maybe?

01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:45.585
I mean what do you think?

01:11:45.585 --> 01:11:47.460
COLIN CALLOWAY: Well,
a couple of years ago--

01:11:47.460 --> 01:11:51.120
Phil, the National Congress
of the American Indian, I

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:54.210
think it was, didn't
they offer an amnesty

01:11:54.210 --> 01:12:01.220
for 2 billion illegal immigrants
who invaded the country?

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:03.360
I think to get to the
spirit of your question

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:07.480
that Native societies, I think
as a historian looking at them,

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:10.270
have been impressive
and inclusive.

01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:10.770
Right?

01:12:10.770 --> 01:12:14.340
And many of them, if you look
at Iroquois, Haudenosaunee,

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:18.240
or Comanche, they're often
the true melting pots

01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:21.690
in that many of the people who
were members citizens, if you

01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:24.600
like, of those
nations began life

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.930
somewhere else as someone else.

01:12:27.930 --> 01:12:30.720
I know that's not at the
core of your question,

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.725
but it does suggest that.

01:12:32.725 --> 01:12:33.600
PHILIP DELORIA: Yeah.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:36.780
I mean, I think I'll just
say the point of a land

01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:39.780
acknowledgement I think is
to have a moment of memory

01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:43.380
and a moment of reverence
and to sort of ask everyone

01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:45.690
to think of that collectively.

01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:48.000
I understand there
are consequences

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.920
that unfold from this.

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.440
But whether one takes that as
the occasion to sort of then

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.020
launch into a full consideration
of those consequences

01:12:55.020 --> 01:12:57.900
and not in a polemical way,
I think is actually wrong.

01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:00.420
And I think it's against
the spirit of the land

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:01.110
acknowledgement.

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:03.240
But I agree with
you in the sense

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:07.170
that there are real
consequences in the here and now

01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:10.700
to the histories that we were
talking about in the past.

01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:14.513
And I think these histories,
it is really important

01:13:14.513 --> 01:13:16.680
to understand the ways that
these histories actually

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:19.530
do continue to reflect
through into the present

01:13:19.530 --> 01:13:23.487
and take us into the
moment and into the crisis

01:13:23.487 --> 01:13:24.570
that you're talking about.

01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:28.470
So there are ways in which
these things do speak.

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:30.123
And I think if we
had many hours,

01:13:30.123 --> 01:13:31.290
we could really get into it.

01:13:31.290 --> 01:13:33.182
But let's go to
the next question.

01:13:33.182 --> 01:13:34.890
AUDIENCE: First of
all, I wanted to thank

01:13:34.890 --> 01:13:37.770
you very much for
providing us this framework

01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:39.900
to look back on our
history with more

01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:42.450
of a Native American slant.

01:13:42.450 --> 01:13:45.900
And you've almost given
me a perfect segue.

01:13:45.900 --> 01:13:48.510
For my question, it
has to do with it

01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:50.610
seems like the
British and the others

01:13:50.610 --> 01:13:53.730
coming here, the whole
colonial effort, the idea

01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:56.610
is that we know better.

01:13:56.610 --> 01:13:57.960
We have a better way of living.

01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:00.660
And we're going to sort
of impose that on you.

01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:02.520
And it strikes me
that even today we

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:05.340
live with that same thing,
except now we invade

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:07.380
with McDonald's and Taco Bells.

01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:09.810
And in our commercial
efforts, we don't we

01:14:09.810 --> 01:14:13.080
don't take your land but we're
going to come to your country.

01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.210
And we're going to
show you a better way

01:14:15.210 --> 01:14:16.500
to live economically.

01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.510
And I was wondering
if you could just

01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:20.910
talk a little more about
what you touched on

01:14:20.910 --> 01:14:25.680
about how our history informs
how things operate today?

01:14:32.010 --> 01:14:33.810
COLIN CALLOWAY: Well,
I think about it--

01:14:33.810 --> 01:14:38.220
a part of the kind of work that
I do and one of the reasons

01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:41.730
why I think that it's important
to teach this to students

01:14:41.730 --> 01:14:43.890
and try and do it in a
careful way that does not

01:14:43.890 --> 01:14:46.650
fall into stereotyping,
because you can have

01:14:46.650 --> 01:14:50.430
very positive stereotypes as
well as negative, and sometimes

01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:51.600
romantic--

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:55.260
is to look back at
early America at a time

01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:59.610
when there were societies
that were functioning and had

01:14:59.610 --> 01:15:03.390
functioned for thousands of
years on different philosophies

01:15:03.390 --> 01:15:06.800
and different
principles that were not

01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.020
all about accumulation,
and consumption,

01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:14.410
and conquest of nature,
and those kinds of things.

01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:18.337
So we probably heard--

01:15:18.337 --> 01:15:19.920
I'm sure Phil's heard
the joke again--

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:23.430
make America great again,
give it back to the Indians.

01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:26.880
And that's somewhat what
that's getting out, right?

01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:30.300
That for so long,
our history was

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:35.490
informed by those early
Brits, English people, who

01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:38.070
came to this continent
and were actually,

01:15:38.070 --> 01:15:41.400
I think, more like blind
men feeling the elephant

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:43.710
than really seeing
what was here.

01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:46.950
But they understood
it and wrote about it

01:15:46.950 --> 01:15:50.160
in terms of civilization
and savagery.

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:54.260
And it's taken us a long time
to sort of get away from that

01:15:54.260 --> 01:16:02.390
and to recognize the qualities
and the essential philosophies

01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:05.240
that indigenous societies
possessed and possess.

01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:14.160
And so I think when you talk
about McDonald's, et cetera,

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:18.770
this is more than just
being like facetious,

01:16:18.770 --> 01:16:21.920
because that is part
of this invasion.

01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:26.720
That Europeans arrive
here with not only plans

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.180
with what to do with
the land, but also plans

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:32.820
with how you will live
a life and structure

01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:34.430
society, et cetera.

01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:37.070
With the result,
of course, that's

01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:40.070
devastating for Native
American society.

01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:46.760
Long after Washington's gone,
you have a United States Indian

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:50.450
Educational Policy
which involves

01:16:50.450 --> 01:16:54.780
wrenching thousands of Indian
children from their homes,

01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:58.110
taking them places like
Carlisle, Pennsylvania,

01:16:58.110 --> 01:17:00.150
and educating them, which
actually, of course,

01:17:00.150 --> 01:17:02.700
means de-educating them.

01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:07.680
Perhaps with good intentions,
but with many cases

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:10.050
horrendous consequences
and legacies

01:17:10.050 --> 01:17:12.540
that are still playing out.

01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:15.980
And I know that's not a direct
answer to your question,

01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:20.102
but I'm a Dartmouth professor
so we can take anything and just

01:17:20.102 --> 01:17:21.060
sort of talk around it.

01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:22.240
AUDIENCE: No.

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:25.250
It's more really just
a platform for thought.

01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:29.190
It occurred to me that we
continue to live history.

01:17:29.190 --> 01:17:31.560
And a lot of the
way we behave today

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:34.185
is very much informed by the way
we behaved 200, 300 years ago.

01:17:34.185 --> 01:17:35.602
COLIN CALLOWAY:
Well, and exactly,

01:17:35.602 --> 01:17:37.860
because the things I'm
talking about the assault

01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:43.480
on Indian land, look at
Standing Rock last year.

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:47.860
And look at the plans to
establish this huge copper

01:17:47.860 --> 01:17:49.570
mine up in Alaska.

01:17:49.570 --> 01:17:53.620
Native people are still
confronted with assaults

01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:55.940
on their resources.

01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:57.570
We may not want the
land but we want

01:17:57.570 --> 01:18:00.610
what's under the land or
the water or something.

01:18:00.610 --> 01:18:03.977
And that of course is going on
globally as we're well aware.

01:18:03.977 --> 01:18:05.060
PHILIP DELORIA: Thank you.

01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:05.310
COLIN CALLOWAY: Thanks.

01:18:05.310 --> 01:18:05.530
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:18:05.530 --> 01:18:07.150
PHILIP DELORIA: Over here.

01:18:07.150 --> 01:18:10.330
AUDIENCE: My question has
to do with the early days

01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:14.830
of the Massachusetts
colony in the 17th century.

01:18:14.830 --> 01:18:19.870
It's my understanding that
Native people were enslaved.

01:18:19.870 --> 01:18:20.900
Is that true?

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:22.720
Could you comment on that?

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:25.930
I read somewhere that
some prominent Puritan

01:18:25.930 --> 01:18:30.250
leader owned a couple of
slaves, Native slaves.

01:18:30.250 --> 01:18:32.500
And I was just wondering if
you could comment on that.

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:33.930
How did that happen?

01:18:33.930 --> 01:18:35.110
COLIN CALLOWAY: Yeah.

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:38.050
PHILIP DELORIA: Some of the
most interesting scholarship

01:18:38.050 --> 01:18:41.080
going on today concerns
the enslavement,

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:43.860
both indigenous enslavement of
African and African descended

01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:47.500
peoples, and the enslavement
of indigenous peoples.

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:52.645
And so I would recommend a
book called The Other Slavery

01:18:52.645 --> 01:18:53.770
which sort of details this.

01:18:53.770 --> 01:18:55.228
And one of the
really interesting--

01:18:55.228 --> 01:18:59.110
he breaks down a sort of
chart, a demographic chart.

01:18:59.110 --> 01:19:03.180
And one of the things that shows
up is between 1650 and 1700,

01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:05.440
this large blip
that is basically

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.030
accounted for by
King Philip's War

01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:09.447
and by other kinds of colonial
wars, which are essentially

01:19:09.447 --> 01:19:12.640
slave raiding wars, the
Yamasee War, these other wars.

01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:14.175
And the slaving of
indigenous people

01:19:14.175 --> 01:19:15.550
is quite interesting
because it's

01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:17.342
different from African
slavery in the sense

01:19:17.342 --> 01:19:22.220
that women and children end
up being the primary focus.

01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:24.970
But Indian enslavement
throughout the Caribbean

01:19:24.970 --> 01:19:29.800
and through sort of flows of
slave trade from the center

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:32.410
of the continent up
through the French,

01:19:32.410 --> 01:19:35.340
down along the seaboard,
there was a massive trade.

01:19:35.340 --> 01:19:37.120
Andrés Reséndez has
said, you know, look,

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:40.030
this is somewhere between
3 million and 5 million

01:19:40.030 --> 01:19:42.910
indigenous people who are slaves
in relation to the 12 million

01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:45.250
that we usually use
hemispherically to talk about

01:19:45.250 --> 01:19:46.310
African slavery.

01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:49.360
So this is a quite significant
and quite substantial number.

01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:52.585
And there is slaving that
goes on among and by, and for,

01:19:52.585 --> 01:19:55.720
and engaged with
indigenous people

01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:59.150
all across the continent for
a long, long period of time.

01:19:59.150 --> 01:20:01.150
And in fact, one of the
most important moments

01:20:01.150 --> 01:20:04.342
is the moment between in
the middle 19th century

01:20:04.342 --> 01:20:05.800
during the settlement
of California

01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:08.590
where basically Californians
engage in what we can truly

01:20:08.590 --> 01:20:10.925
call a kind of a
death slavery, as it

01:20:10.925 --> 01:20:12.550
was in the early days
of the Caribbean.

01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.730
Right?

01:20:12.730 --> 01:20:14.980
Taking slaves and literally
working them to death.

01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:17.018
Capture your slaves in April.

01:20:17.018 --> 01:20:19.060
Work them and don't feed
them through the summer.

01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:20.360
Let them die.

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:20.860
Right?

01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:22.818
And then capture a whole
other bunch of people.

01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:26.515
I mean so this is a story that
is really, really important.

01:20:26.515 --> 01:20:28.390
I want to thank you for
raising the question.

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:30.265
COLIN CALLOWAY: And in
answer to the question

01:20:30.265 --> 01:20:32.260
about Massachusetts
in New England.

01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:34.050
Absolutely.

01:20:34.050 --> 01:20:37.900
There were Indian slaves,
Indians take the slaves captive

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:39.535
after Peqot War,
King Philip's War.

01:20:39.535 --> 01:20:41.160
And they were shipped
to the Caribbean.

01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:42.368
There are some who stay here.

01:20:42.368 --> 01:20:46.240
And there are Indian slaves
who come here from elsewhere.

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:49.720
You get, in Quebec,
you get Indian slaves.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:52.450
They're all called
Pawnee, meaning Pawnee.

01:20:52.450 --> 01:20:56.390
That doesn't mean they're all
Pawnees, but that was such a--

01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:59.560
the eastern plains was a place
where other Indians raided

01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:00.560
for slaves.

01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:03.760
And they found their way
to Quebec, to Charleston,

01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.320
to Boston.

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:08.920
This is-- as Phil said-- this
is something we're only really

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:11.310
just beginning to unravel it.

01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:13.590
And there's a book
by Margaret Newell.

01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:15.230
It's got Brethren in the title.

01:21:15.230 --> 01:21:15.730
I forget it.

01:21:15.730 --> 01:21:19.390
But it's specifically about
Indian slavery in New England.

01:21:19.390 --> 01:21:21.730
Out in the last few years.

01:21:21.730 --> 01:21:22.720
And you find that.

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:25.210
Sometimes they
may not be slaves,

01:21:25.210 --> 01:21:27.425
but they're indentured children.

01:21:27.425 --> 01:21:28.550
And they're in a household.

01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:30.522
But they're essentially
domestic slaves.

01:21:30.522 --> 01:21:32.980
PHILIP DELORIA: I mean arguably
the most enslaved continent

01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:34.330
in the history of the world.

01:21:34.330 --> 01:21:35.950
So many different
forms of slavery,

01:21:35.950 --> 01:21:39.160
including indigenous slavery,
colonial forms of slavery,

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.100
colonial indigenous hybrid forms
of slavery, a slave trade that

01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:43.218
is sort of everywhere.

01:21:43.218 --> 01:21:45.260
And we're really just
beginning to understand it.

01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:45.490
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:21:45.490 --> 01:21:46.600
PHILIP DELORIA: Let's
go to the next question.

01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:48.850
AUDIENCE: One of the first
things that Washington does

01:21:48.850 --> 01:21:50.650
is to bring Vermont
into the Union.

01:21:50.650 --> 01:21:54.790
And that story's always told as
the Allen brothers and Governor

01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:57.220
Chittenden, they have land
titles under New Hampshire.

01:21:57.220 --> 01:22:01.760
They want to get the New
York land titles vacated.

01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:04.450
So they were able to manipulate
Washington to doing that.

01:22:04.450 --> 01:22:07.090
And then they agreed
to come into the Union.

01:22:07.090 --> 01:22:09.520
Vermont comes in
as the 14th state.

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:11.710
And they're dangling
joining British Canada

01:22:11.710 --> 01:22:13.265
to get that to happen.

01:22:13.265 --> 01:22:14.890
So that's always the
story that's told.

01:22:14.890 --> 01:22:16.348
Washington doesn't
want the British

01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:18.760
to have Lake Champlain, et
cetera, so he agrees to this.

01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:21.580
But how much also
is that they felt

01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:24.610
the Allen and Chittenden
felt that the US would

01:22:24.610 --> 01:22:26.928
uphold the dispossession
of the Abenaki?

01:22:26.928 --> 01:22:28.720
Whereas that might have
been more difficult

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:29.410
under the British.

01:22:29.410 --> 01:22:30.950
And that was also
part of the story.

01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:33.508
I was thinking about the
early part of the comments

01:22:33.508 --> 01:22:34.300
that you're making.

01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:36.250
We always see that as
sort of power politics

01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:39.160
between the new United
States and Great Britain.

01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:44.180
But the Abenaki story is
not told in that aspect.

01:22:44.180 --> 01:22:46.570
COLIN CALLOWAY: So this is
an interesting story for me

01:22:46.570 --> 01:22:48.310
because I'm British.

01:22:48.310 --> 01:22:49.260
I live in Vermont.

01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:50.885
And I've written a
book on the Abenaki.

01:22:50.885 --> 01:22:52.500
PHILIP DELORIA: Whoa.

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.460
COLIN CALLOWAY: So
looking at Vermont,

01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:57.260
there was a moment when it
almost saw sense, right?

01:22:57.260 --> 01:23:00.185
And it came back.

01:23:00.185 --> 01:23:01.060
But it didn't happen.

01:23:01.060 --> 01:23:03.520
And in Vermont, the Allen
brothers, Ethan Allen,

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:05.350
these are these are folk heroes.

01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:07.540
So if you've done
Abenaki history,

01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:11.350
you have to be a little careful.

01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:13.710
But I think--

01:23:13.710 --> 01:23:15.740
I mean it's a very
complicated thing.

01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:18.150
The Holdeman Papers
where I worked

01:23:18.150 --> 01:23:21.330
finding a lot of these records
are full with this stuff.

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:23.750
And it's very complicated thing.

01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:26.320
And I think that the Allen
brothers are actually

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:30.010
what my Scottish uncles
referred to as chancers.

01:23:30.010 --> 01:23:31.520
They were opportunists.

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:34.990
But Abenaki land
is clearly there.

01:23:34.990 --> 01:23:41.540
And the Allen brothers,
one of the people like--

01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:44.990
there's different ways
of dispossessing people.

01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:46.730
You can go to war with them.

01:23:46.730 --> 01:23:48.230
You can make treaties with them.

01:23:48.230 --> 01:23:53.270
You can make deeds
that steal their land.

01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:56.260
Or you can actually say you were
never there in the first place,

01:23:56.260 --> 01:23:56.930
right?

01:23:56.930 --> 01:24:00.290
It's much easier to dispossess
people who were never there.

01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:02.810
And that, I think, as
I see it, is very often

01:24:02.810 --> 01:24:06.140
what the Allen brothers do.

01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:08.230
So they're up on Lake Champlain.

01:24:08.230 --> 01:24:10.835
And there are Abenaki people
watching them, surveying,

01:24:10.835 --> 01:24:11.960
saying, what are you doing?

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:13.310
This is our land.

01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:15.140
And when the Allen
brothers talk about it,

01:24:15.140 --> 01:24:19.400
they refer to these Abenakis
as St. Francis Indians which

01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:23.870
was the term of choice, I
think, to refer to all Abenakis

01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:26.030
because many
Abenakis from Vermont

01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:29.360
had migrated north
into the St. Lawrence

01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:32.420
and taken up residence at
what is now [INAUDIBLE],,

01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:36.410
originally a French mission
village called St. Francis.

01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:39.670
And so by referring
to these people,

01:24:39.670 --> 01:24:42.050
these Abenaki people
who are-- as I see it--

01:24:42.050 --> 01:24:43.730
standing on their
own land, trying

01:24:43.730 --> 01:24:47.480
to defend their own
land as St. Francis,

01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:50.330
the Allen brothers are saying
you don't even belong here.

01:24:50.330 --> 01:24:54.260
You belong in Canada
with the British.

01:24:54.260 --> 01:24:57.320
So it's a complicated question.

01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:59.840
But if the core of
your question is

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:04.160
were the Allen brothers
really after Abenaki land?

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.020
It's a very short answer.

01:25:06.020 --> 01:25:07.750
Absolutely.

01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:10.250
PHILIP DELORIA: So we have about
five minutes left, I think.

01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:12.202
And I'm saying
apologies in advance

01:25:12.202 --> 01:25:13.910
to folks who are at
the back of the line.

01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:15.952
So I think we maybe take
a couple more questions.

01:25:15.952 --> 01:25:16.640
We'll go here.

01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:18.180
And then is that
Maria over there?

01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:19.552
Yeah, Maria.

01:25:19.552 --> 01:25:21.260
AUDIENCE: So this
question actually comes

01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:22.760
from our online audience.

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:24.440
This comes from a
woman named Marcia

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:28.280
whose family settled in
central Pennsylvania in 1737.

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:30.523
She says her family
has many stories that

01:25:30.523 --> 01:25:32.690
have been passed down about
meeting Native Americans

01:25:32.690 --> 01:25:35.210
but she would like to
know what that atmosphere

01:25:35.210 --> 01:25:41.162
of those meetings would be
like in the early 1700s.

01:25:41.162 --> 01:25:43.120
COLIN CALLOWAY: It's
actually the kind of thing

01:25:43.120 --> 01:25:46.360
I'm really interested in.

01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:49.600
Because for all of the
brutality of the history

01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:54.120
of this continent
and colonialism,

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:57.240
people spend a lot
of time getting along

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:59.220
and producing children.

01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:04.440
And so there are lots
of areas and arenas

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:10.660
where violence is not
the go to response.

01:26:10.660 --> 01:26:12.710
And in particular, I'm
thinking in Pennsylvania

01:26:12.710 --> 01:26:13.640
and Delaware country.

01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:15.800
There's a tradition
in Delaware society

01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:19.460
about these people
are peacemakers.

01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:20.630
They are intermediaries.

01:26:20.630 --> 01:26:22.190
They are diplomats.

01:26:22.190 --> 01:26:26.720
And so the initial
response to a stranger

01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:29.080
is not necessarily to kill them.

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:32.060
And depending on
different societies,

01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:37.010
your response can be--

01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:39.380
so there are two kinds
of people in the world.

01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:43.050
There's us and other people.

01:26:43.050 --> 01:26:46.680
And other people who
are not kin and family

01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:49.350
are dangerous and
potentially hostile.

01:26:49.350 --> 01:26:50.580
Right?

01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:52.020
So, OK, you could kill them.

01:26:52.020 --> 01:26:56.040
But more often I think an
initial response is, OK,

01:26:56.040 --> 01:26:59.940
so if these people are strangers
are dangerous as strangers,

01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:02.670
how can we make
them less dangerous?

01:27:02.670 --> 01:27:07.600
By making them human, by
bringing them into our society.

01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:09.240
And that can be done
through a ritual.

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:12.055
It can be done
through a ceremony.

01:27:12.055 --> 01:27:13.750
It can be done through adoption.

01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:16.720
It can be done through
sexual intercourse.

01:27:16.720 --> 01:27:21.140
And so I think one of the
things that we often miss--

01:27:21.140 --> 01:27:23.330
by we, I mean me--

01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:25.730
as historians looking
back over history,

01:27:25.730 --> 01:27:27.860
the light is so good
on the bloodshed

01:27:27.860 --> 01:27:30.240
and the wars, et cetera.

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:34.340
But there's lots and
lots of places and times

01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:38.240
where people are not doing
that and they're actually

01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:40.880
intermarrying and
welcoming each other

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:44.060
and trying to reach across
these cultural gulfs

01:27:44.060 --> 01:27:46.040
and sometimes failing.

01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:46.580
Right?

01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:49.455
And that's a huge part of
the tragedy when people

01:27:49.455 --> 01:27:50.580
are actually trying to do--

01:27:50.580 --> 01:27:53.970
if you like-- the right
thing and getting it wrong.

01:27:53.970 --> 01:27:59.890
So I've done a lot of
work looking at captives.

01:27:59.890 --> 01:28:01.540
So if you walk into
an Indian vill--

01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:04.220
I remember years ago at the
Newberry Library, Helen Tanner

01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:06.280
saying to me, Colin.

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.030
Phil, if you knew
Helen, you can imagine--

01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:10.970
you will never find an
Indian village with members

01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:12.710
of only one tribe in it.

01:28:12.710 --> 01:28:14.960
And what she was
talking about was

01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:19.190
how Indian societies embraced,
adopted, and welcomed

01:28:19.190 --> 01:28:22.700
other people and increased.

01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:26.060
By the 18th century,
those other people

01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:29.400
often included white people.

01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:31.660
And this is not just
me making this up.

01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:33.880
Benjamin Franklin
worried about this.

01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:35.327
Other people worried about it.

01:28:35.327 --> 01:28:36.910
Benjamin Franklin
said, wait a minute.

01:28:36.910 --> 01:28:39.710
We're supposed to be
building a city on a hill.

01:28:39.710 --> 01:28:42.130
And we're the model
of civilization.

01:28:42.130 --> 01:28:45.220
But a lot of our own
citizens given half a chance

01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:47.510
are going off to
live with Indians.

01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:49.510
And a lot of people who
have been taken captive,

01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:53.830
given the chance to come
home, say they'd rather not.

01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:56.200
And I don't think you
do that in societies

01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:57.850
that are just violent.

01:28:57.850 --> 01:29:02.470
So there have got to be these
mechanisms for adoption.

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:04.210
And part of captive
taking, when I

01:29:04.210 --> 01:29:07.030
look at captives that are
taking on the Connecticut River

01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:10.540
and taken up to
Abenaki country, you

01:29:10.540 --> 01:29:13.690
have the incredible violence
of a raid in which parents

01:29:13.690 --> 01:29:15.220
might be killed.

01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:19.180
And then the children would
be given little moccasins

01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:22.540
and carried on the shoulder
or pulled along on toboggans

01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:27.520
and treated with kindness as
part of the process getting

01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:33.040
them ready for adoption for
them to then become Abenaki.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.980
So you've got a cultural tussle
here that's going both ways.

01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:39.820
And sometimes what Indian
people are doing I think

01:29:39.820 --> 01:29:43.480
is meeting outsiders,
and even Europeans,

01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:45.985
with kindness rather
than violence.

01:29:45.985 --> 01:29:48.360
PHILIP DELORIA: So let's do--
we'll do one last question.

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:50.980
Maria, kind of--
and we'll go quick.

01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:52.390
And we'll try to wrap things up.

01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:52.850
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

01:29:52.850 --> 01:29:54.350
I'll try and keep
this really brief.

01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:56.230
I just wanted to express
a lot of gratitude

01:29:56.230 --> 01:29:57.640
for the conversation here today.

01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:59.380
It's so important.

01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:02.340
I'm speaking as a history
professor here at UMass Boston.

01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:03.940
Some of my students are here.

01:30:03.940 --> 01:30:06.430
And my question actually
is in part inspired by them

01:30:06.430 --> 01:30:10.240
but also inspired by, I think,
the very careful attention

01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:12.910
you've all brought to the
importance of doing work

01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:15.070
to change the dominant
narratives that

01:30:15.070 --> 01:30:17.410
are pervasive in so many
different ways, right?

01:30:17.410 --> 01:30:19.210
Passed down through
the generations,

01:30:19.210 --> 01:30:20.920
pervasive in our
cultural institutions,

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:23.500
pervasive in our
education system.

01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:25.540
And my question really
comes from an experience

01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:29.830
I have in the classroom
semester after semester when

01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:33.040
my students tell me that
they never got any of this

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:34.970
at earlier points
in their education.

01:30:34.970 --> 01:30:36.490
And so we always
have to start class

01:30:36.490 --> 01:30:38.860
with a process of unlearning.

01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:40.570
And so my question
is really I'd love

01:30:40.570 --> 01:30:43.720
to hear your thoughts about
opportunities or points

01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:46.090
for intervention
that we might be

01:30:46.090 --> 01:30:48.310
able to pursue to
kind of start changing

01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:51.397
that narrative at earlier
points in the education system.

01:30:55.053 --> 01:30:56.040
JULIA A KING: I can--

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:56.998
PHILIP DELORIA: Please.

01:30:56.998 --> 01:31:01.560
JULIA A KING: I mean I think
that's the $64,000 question.

01:31:01.560 --> 01:31:04.620
There's a lot of parts
that are involved

01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:09.240
in doing that, beginning
with the educational system.

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:13.380
And the way I see the groups,
the tribes, that I work with

01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:16.050
do it is a constant
raising awareness.

01:31:16.050 --> 01:31:17.370
I mean they're going out.

01:31:17.370 --> 01:31:19.020
And then I do my part.

01:31:19.020 --> 01:31:22.680
As an archeologist, they
ask me to do certain things

01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.970
or provide information.

01:31:23.970 --> 01:31:25.630
And I try to do that.

01:31:25.630 --> 01:31:31.920
But I almost feel like it's
one school child at a time.

01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:35.370
And so I do think it
is very challenging.

01:31:35.370 --> 01:31:38.010
I will tell you in Virginia,
I have a colleague,

01:31:38.010 --> 01:31:40.230
Martin Galvan he's
written about what's

01:31:40.230 --> 01:31:42.540
called strategic essentialism.

01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:48.660
And in this essay, he writes
about how the Virginia groups,

01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:50.910
the Virginia tribes-- which
are actually now federally

01:31:50.910 --> 01:31:53.790
recognized or many of them are--

01:31:53.790 --> 01:31:58.140
how they sort of take
those dominant narratives

01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:01.290
and try to derive
authority from them

01:32:01.290 --> 01:32:03.540
and then flip the narrative.

01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:05.430
So they get in that way.

01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:06.870
So I know we don't
have much time

01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:10.830
but that may be a
way to try to get

01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:12.720
people's attention with that.

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:14.310
COLIN CALLOWAY: I
think that I mean

01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:16.290
it is the $64,000 question.

01:32:16.290 --> 01:32:22.500
And I get that
question or concern

01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:27.080
not only from white
students from Connecticut

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:31.090
but from Native American
students from Oklahoma.

01:32:31.090 --> 01:32:34.000
They've got Indian symbols
on their license plates

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:36.910
but they're not teaching
this in schools apparently.

01:32:36.910 --> 01:32:40.190
And I agree with all
of these strategies.

01:32:40.190 --> 01:32:42.250
But at some point,
it's political

01:32:42.250 --> 01:32:43.820
because I've done
a lot of workshop

01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:47.860
with teachers over the years,
high school, middle school, et

01:32:47.860 --> 01:32:49.460
cetera, from all
over the country.

01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:51.430
And they are hungry
for this information

01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:53.890
because their students are
hungry for the information.

01:32:53.890 --> 01:32:58.370
But very often, at the
end people have said,

01:32:58.370 --> 01:33:01.090
yeah, this is all
great, professor,

01:33:01.090 --> 01:33:03.700
but you're not
setting up the tests

01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:08.590
by which we are judged on how
our students are performing.

01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:10.940
And so I think this
is something where

01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:14.500
there has to come some
leadership from the top

01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:18.430
as well so that those teachers
that I see, if you like,

01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:21.010
struggling in the trenches
coming hungry for stuff

01:33:21.010 --> 01:33:25.420
that they can use in a unit in
class, but always, if you like,

01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:27.200
looking over their shoulder.

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:27.880
All right?

01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:31.120
I can talk about the Iroquois
Confederacy and the Trail

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:35.620
of Tears, et cetera, but
I know that my students

01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:37.640
are going to be tested.

01:33:37.640 --> 01:33:39.070
And I don't want
them to be found

01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:45.070
wanting on these other things
that educational policy

01:33:45.070 --> 01:33:49.610
makers, if you like,
say we have to have.

01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:52.793
So, yeah, I don't have
a quick answer for it.

01:33:52.793 --> 01:33:54.710
Obviously, I don't have
a quick answer for it.

01:33:54.710 --> 01:33:56.480
I haven't been able
to do it in 25 years.

01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:01.320
But I think this is
what we're dealing with.

01:34:01.320 --> 01:34:03.950
PHILIP DELORIA: And you know
as a former K-12 educator,

01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:05.780
I can say I was
handed a curriculum.

01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:08.120
I was given that
curriculum to teach.

01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:12.230
So many curricula
have been developed

01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:15.182
over the years, so many teacher
training kinds of things.

01:34:15.182 --> 01:34:16.640
I think the pressure,
my sympathies

01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:18.057
are always with
classroom teachers

01:34:18.057 --> 01:34:20.690
on the very real
challenges that they

01:34:20.690 --> 01:34:22.700
face in the classroom
around this stuff.

01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:24.530
At the same time, I
also recognize the ways

01:34:24.530 --> 01:34:28.100
in watching my own children
pass through third grade,

01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:30.890
when you got it, sixth grade
when you kind of got it,

01:34:30.890 --> 01:34:33.475
is that teachers also tend
to teach their own memories.

01:34:33.475 --> 01:34:34.850
And the third
grade teacher tends

01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:38.510
to teach what that teacher
actually remembered

01:34:38.510 --> 01:34:40.100
being taught as a third grader.

01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:42.080
It's amazing to me the
sort of reproduction

01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:44.712
that happens there, the power
of cultural reproduction.

01:34:44.712 --> 01:34:46.920
And intervening in that is
a really hard thing to do,

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:49.450
particularly, you
know as Colin has said

01:34:49.450 --> 01:34:51.800
and Julia said, around the
restrictions that actually

01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:52.800
appear in the classroom.

01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:54.450
This is a major,
major challenge to us.

01:34:54.450 --> 01:34:57.050
And I think if I might
just say a few things

01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:57.980
by way of wrapping up.

01:34:57.980 --> 01:35:01.190
I began by saying, look,
Indian people make up 1.5%.

01:35:01.190 --> 01:35:02.750
We deserve more
of the narrative.

01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:05.360
I think this is really true.

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.170
But we struggle to get
1.5% of the narrative.

01:35:09.170 --> 01:35:12.260
And until we can get
up to 10% or 15% or 20%

01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:16.550
and realize that the United
States is fundamentally about--

01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:19.070
not just slavery, because that
is the important place where

01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:21.890
schools actually have
intervened but also

01:35:21.890 --> 01:35:24.290
about Native American
history and the ways

01:35:24.290 --> 01:35:27.200
that this country is
built on a continent's

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:28.650
worth of native land.

01:35:28.650 --> 01:35:30.890
I think this is a struggle
we have to continue to do.

01:35:30.890 --> 01:35:33.590
We do it, of course, from
a certain perspective.

01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:36.320
As academics, we find ourselves
caught up in mission creep

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:39.540
as we try to get
into public schools.

01:35:39.540 --> 01:35:40.680
So this is hard.

01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:42.820
It's a hard challenge
and a hard problem.

01:35:42.820 --> 01:35:44.612
COLIN CALLOWAY: And it
is hard for teachers

01:35:44.612 --> 01:35:47.600
because if you're
teaching American history

01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:51.320
with due attention to, say,
Native American history

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:55.943
and slavery in a country
where that dominant narrative

01:35:55.943 --> 01:35:57.860
that you're talking about
is so strong, and so

01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:01.550
compelling, and so satisfying
for so many people, that

01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:02.960
can be very uncomfortable.

01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:06.190
People can-- this
can be unAmerican.

01:36:06.190 --> 01:36:08.360
With people like me, that's
not a particular worry,

01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:11.113
but for a lot of people
this is a hard thing.

01:36:11.113 --> 01:36:12.530
PHILIP DELORIA:
So I think what we

01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:15.320
can agree upon is that the
work that's happening here

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:18.200
with our guests is
contributing to the kind

01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:20.343
of ongoing questioning
of these narratives.

01:36:20.343 --> 01:36:22.010
And I hope you'll
join me in thank them.

01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:25.060
