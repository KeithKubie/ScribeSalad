[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.635 --> 00:00:07.260
ANDY WEIR: My whole
approach to writing

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.760
is just I want to
write science fiction

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.640
and I want it to be
scientifically accurate.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.520
So that's the kind of
playground that I live in.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.000
And then for "The
Martian," both stories

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.310
started out as
just me envisioning

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.930
something cool
and science-y that

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.470
could happen in the future.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.830
So for "The Martian," I was
thinking of a manned mission

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.473
to Mars.

00:00:26.473 --> 00:00:27.640
How do you get people there?

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.682
How do you get them back?

00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:31.590
How do you make sure they
don't die if something breaks?

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.940
What are your backup systems?

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.890
What are your backups
to your backups?

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.020
And the increasingly
desperate things

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.960
you would have to do to stay
alive if enough stuff broke,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.770
I thought, like, oh, this could
make an interesting story.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.570
And so that's kind of the
impetus of "The Martian."

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.820
For "Artemis," I
was thinking of,

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.010
like, what is humanity's
first city that's not on Earth

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.350
going to be like?

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.630
And so the first question I had
to think of was, like, well,

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.070
where would it be?

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.720
Would it be in low Earth orbit?

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.010
Would it be on the moon?

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.910
Would it be on Mars?

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.760
Those are really the only
three logical candidates

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.630
for the first non-Earth city.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.550
And I decided the moon was best.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.050
A low Earth orbit, every
gram of the city's mass

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.637
would have to be put up there.

00:01:17.637 --> 00:01:19.470
Whereas on the moon,
there's local resources

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.310
you can make use of.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.790
You can smelt the
aluminum that present.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.030
There's huge amounts of oxygen
trapped in the oxides there.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.590
And so I was like, oh, OK.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.330
And Mars is just
too damn far away.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.650
Like if you were standing
on a football field--

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.470
whatever your definition of
football is, but either way

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.220
you want to do it.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.370
If you're standing
on a football field,

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.430
if Mars were at the
other goal, the moon

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.290
would be 4 inches
in front of you.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.790
Yeah.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.258
That's 10 centimeters.

00:01:49.258 --> 00:01:51.748
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.010
So yeah, that just
gives you an idea

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.060
of the scale of the distance.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.308
And so the moon is a much
better place to build it.

00:02:00.308 --> 00:02:02.350
Then the next thing I was
thinking of, it's like,

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.440
OK, well, why would
you build a city?

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.900
Every city that exists
exists for a reason,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.580
and it's always an
economic reason.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.590
People don't go off and
build a city somewhere

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.990
because it'd be
awesome, they do it

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.870
because there's a living
to be made doing something.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.840
Either it's a logging
town, a railroad depot,

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.260
it's on a major river so
that, you know, whatever.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.880
And so I decided, I've always
hated the sci-fi excuses that

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.770
are given for lunar cities.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.110
It's like, well, we're
there to mine the moon.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.850
I'm like, send robots.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.410
You know, robots?

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.030
First off, they're
a lot hardier.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.340
Humans are soft and squishy
and they die easily,

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.400
and people care when humans die.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.650
People aren't that worried
about when your robot dies.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.900
And same thing.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.960
It's like, oh, there's
overpopulation on Earth.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.820
Then colonize the seafloor.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.610
It's a lot closer and easier
to colonize than the moon.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:51.160
You know?

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.370
And it's like, oh, well,
persecution on Earth.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.740
These people fled persecution.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.660
OK, first off, if you can
afford to move to the moon,

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.130
you're not the persecuted class.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.090
And second off, even if
somehow that is true,

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.720
then your persecutors can
sure as hell come after you.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.150
So I decided, tourism.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.530
The answer is tourism.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.720
So it came together
into this, OK, it's

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.930
a small tourist economy.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:15.810
And I based it off--

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.580
I know I'm going way off
where your question was, but--

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.960
JASON GESSNER: No, that's great.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.890
ANDY WEIR: --hey,
you know, I ramble.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.890
Tourism.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.500
So I based "Artemis" off
of real-world tourism-based

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.000
cities.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.410
Like single-source economies
like islands in the Caribbean

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.680
or out in the Pacific
that are all--

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.890
that their only source
of income is tourism.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.860
All they have going for
them, in terms of economics,

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.048
is the natural
beauty that they have

00:03:43.048 --> 00:03:45.090
and the fact that people
want to come and see it.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.980
And the way-- and
those always end up

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.340
being a bunch of high-end,
wealthy, kind of like hotels,

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.750
casinos, entertainment things,
and then the poor people who

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.690
live there.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.890
And this is not a hashtag
#OccupyMoon kind of message

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:59.730
that I'm making.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.620
I'm just saying that that's how
those economies always show up.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.310
And so it's really neat because
you just think about one thing,

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.170
and it leads to the next thing,
which leads to the next thing.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.165
So then I had "Artemis" and I'm
like, OK, that's a neat idea.

00:04:11.165 --> 00:04:13.290
It seems like there'd be
a lot of different stories

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.350
that could take place there,
especially since it's too far

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.019
away from Earth to
really be-- to really

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.760
have any laws enforced on it.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.380
So it's the old West, as well.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.600
And so that's how I ended up
coming up with a story for it,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.420
about a small-time criminal
who gets in way the hell

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.620
over her head.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.400
And with "The Martian," it
was just a single person

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.870
was the main character.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.310
You're rooting for
him to survive.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.920
But I'm not-- I mean,
despite my success,

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.730
I am not a very good writer.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.100
I'll say that.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:47.440
I-- no one would accuse "The
Martian" of being literature,

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.090
right?

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.530
Mark Watney at the
end of the book

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.750
is the same as he was at
the beginning of the book.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.460
He did not undergo any change.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.202
He didn't grow as
a person at all.

00:04:56.202 --> 00:04:58.410
You don't know anything
about his deeper motivations.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.702
The only thing you know about
Mark Watney is he's smart

00:05:00.702 --> 00:05:02.100
and he didn't want to die.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:05.513
Well, that probably applies to
everyone in this room, right?

00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:07.930
Like, you're all fairly smart
people, you work for Google,

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.290
and I'm guessing none of
you want to die, right?

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.528
And so there was
no depth at all.

00:05:13.528 --> 00:05:15.070
And people liked
the story because it

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.582
was an entirely
plot-driven story

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:18.040
and it's all about
problem-solving.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.210
But for "Artemis," I'm
like, I want to grow as a--

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.840
I want to become a
better writer than I am,

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.420
so I really want to make a
story that's character-driven.

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:29.710
I want to make a deep, complex
character who's flawed.

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.170
She's made bad
decisions in the past.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.810
She makes bad decisions
during the course of the book.

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.510
She's a fundamentally
good person, though,

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.840
and she tries her best to do
good, while at the same time

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.950
being a bit of a screwup.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.523
And that's what I was
shooting for with Jazz.

00:05:45.523 --> 00:05:47.440
And I may have overshot
the mark a little bit,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.523
because I know there's
some percentage of people--

00:05:49.523 --> 00:05:50.110
I don't know.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.030
What percentage of you
have read "Artemis" at all?

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.530
Yeah.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.050
So it's like, yeah,
some people, not a lot.

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.480
And probably "The Martian"?

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.480
How about "The Martian"?

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.980
Yeah.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.890
See, so "The Martian"
is much more popular.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.180
But in "Artemis," some
people were actually

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.210
just alienated by Jazz,
the main character,

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.180
because she's such a screwup.

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.420
Like she tends to be
very self-destructive

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.220
and people are, like,
having a tough time

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.220
rooting for this person.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.310
So anyway, that is the
extraordinarily roundabout

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:25.017
answer to your question
of the main differences.

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:27.100
I was really shooting for
a character-driven story

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.780
with "Artemis."

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:30.250
JASON GESSNER: Yeah, cool.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.437
So sort of to that end,
in the acknowledgments

00:06:33.437 --> 00:06:35.020
at the end of the
book, you have a lot

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.610
of people to thank
for sort of helping

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.385
you craft that character.

00:06:38.385 --> 00:06:40.010
Could you talk a
little bit about that?

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.290
ANDY WEIR: Yeah.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:41.832
JASON GESSNER: And
how you approached

00:06:41.832 --> 00:06:45.460
writing a female protagonist
in that situation?

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.330
ANDY WEIR: Yeah.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:48.290
So when I started--
like I said, I

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.710
designed the whole
city of Artemis first.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.290
And then I started
coming up with stories

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:54.880
that might take place in it.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.830
And I came up with a
story that was nothing

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:58.210
like "Artemis" is now.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.560
I came up with a
completely different story,

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.477
a completely different
set of main characters.

00:07:01.477 --> 00:07:04.720
Everything-- really almost
no overlap with the story

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.340
that the book became.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.760
And I thought about
it, and Jazz Bashara, I

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.120
needed sort of an
underworld character.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.390
I needed a person who's
like a lovable rogue.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.520
And she was just going
to be in a few scenes.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.010
And so I arbitrarily
decided, oh, Artemis

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.640
is intensely international.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:26.922
It's like, if you're rich, if
you can afford to get there,

00:07:26.922 --> 00:07:27.880
then you can get there.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.510
Think of like
America in the 1830s.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.150
Basically if you're from
Germany, if you can get here,

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.140
welcome aboard.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.850
If you're from China, if you
can get here, hey, you're here.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.750
You know, so it's the
same with Artemis,

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:43.060
and so I just kind of
picked random nationalities

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.030
for people.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.490
And so I'm like, OK, my
lovable rogue, what's

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:47.980
a country I haven't used yet?

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:48.910
Saudi Arabia.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:50.030
OK, good enough.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.600
And what-- I'll
make her a woman,

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.730
just 'cause mental coin toss.

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.310
And so that's how
Jazz Bashara was born.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.320
And I thought, oh, OK, she's--

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:02.260
in that walk-through, I just
kind of wrote an outline.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.838
She was only in two
or three scenes.

00:08:03.838 --> 00:08:05.380
She was there for
the main characters

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.810
to acquire some illegal
goods kind of thing.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.900
Anyway, that plot,
that story sucked.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.407
I thought about it and it
just wasn't working for me.

00:08:14.407 --> 00:08:16.240
And I was just like,
ah, this isn't working.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.410
This is not good.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.395
But I think the setting
is really solid.

00:08:19.395 --> 00:08:20.770
So I'm going to
ditch that story,

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.350
forget about all the characters,
whatever, they're all gone.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.100
Come up with a completely
different story.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.010
So I came up with
a second revision--

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.830
not even a revision, just a
completely different story.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.240
And as needed, I plucked
the useful characters

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.240
that I'd already invented
and put them in there,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.370
and Jazz was one of
the people that I did.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.250
And here she was a
little more central,

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.240
but not the main
character by any means.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.130
She was a little more prevalent.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.710
I had to define her
a little deeper.

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.750
I'm like, oh, she grew up on
Artemis, and stuff like that.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.620
And she is kind of a
lowlife, but she's also--

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.590
she's going to help the
protagonist at the end

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.660
because she loves her
city kind of thing.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.290
But that was about it.

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:02.470
And that story also sucked,
and so I ditched that.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:05.140
And I'm like, well,
Jazz is actually

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:06.730
a pretty interesting character.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:09.790
So I'm like, well, what if I
wrote a story that's actually

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.490
centered on this
originally-intended-to-be

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:13.660
a secondary character?

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.160
And I'm like, well,
then they'd make

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.870
like a crime story, a
story like, you know,

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:19.850
a heist, a caper kind of thing.

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.940
And I'm like, I feel
like I could do that.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.330
That could be interesting.

00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:25.790
And so that's what "Artemis" is.

00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:27.460
And so I found myself
in this situation

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:32.300
where I have a female
Saudi-descended protagonist.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.910
You know, write what you know.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:39.070
And so by that time, she
was so ingrained in my mind

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:41.617
as who she was, that if
I had tried to change her

00:09:41.617 --> 00:09:43.450
into being something
I'm more familiar with,

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.880
like a white man, whatever,
my imagination would

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.610
have rebelled.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.027
Would have gone,
now, now, no, no.

00:09:48.027 --> 00:09:50.620
That's not who that is.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.690
So I found myself in the
rather nerve-racking situation

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:57.620
of writing a female
lead character.

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.770
Now, the fact that she's
Saudi didn't really

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.340
matter, because although
she was born in Saudi Arabia

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.230
and lived there until
she was six years old,

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.960
she and her father moved
to the moon, to Artemis,

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.730
and she's been there ever since.

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.700
And so culturally
she is Artemisian.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:18.410
Just like, again with the early
America metaphor, you know,

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:20.540
how the second
generation of kids,

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.460
they have a lot of
the morals and beliefs

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.740
from the old country,
but they're very much

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.770
a product of their environment
that they grew up in.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.190
And so I didn't have
any problem with making

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:33.200
her a convincing Saudi
because she's not Saudi,

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.280
she's Artemisian.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:38.030
And that's a culture I made
up, so I'm right by definition.

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:41.720
But being a woman, she's
a woman, however equal--

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.290
actually it's unequal, because
Jazz is abnormally intelligent.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:46.430
She's a genius.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:50.690
So-- but however equal
we are in intellect,

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.420
men and women are just
different psychologically

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:54.540
in a lot of ways.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.510
And so I didn't
want to just write

00:10:56.510 --> 00:10:58.850
a woman who seemed like a man.

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.700
And so I did the only thing
I could think of to do,

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:03.950
which is what I do with any
other scientific question,

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.000
is subject matter experts.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.180
So after I wrote the
book, I handed it

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:10.310
to every woman I could
trust not to throw it up

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.900
on The Pirate Bay.

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.360
Just like-- every
woman in my circle

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.540
of trust, my girlfriend,
my mother, everybody

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:19.250
at the publisher
that was female,

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.438
I said, please read this.

00:11:20.438 --> 00:11:22.730
I mean, read it and give me
whatever feedback you want,

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.550
but please also specifically
give me feedback

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:28.760
with an eye toward
convincing, or moments

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.700
that just rubbed you
the wrong way of like,

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.397
ooh, that didn't
seem like a woman.

00:11:32.397 --> 00:11:33.980
That seems like a
man writing a woman.

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:34.813
JASON GESSNER: Sure.

00:11:34.813 --> 00:11:38.520
ANDY WEIR: And I incorporated
that feedback and made changes.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.570
But still in the end, you know,
there were complaints about it

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:46.040
in reviews at large, that she's
still a little too masculine.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:51.773
Of course, I maintain she's a
woman who was born in the 2060s

00:11:51.773 --> 00:11:52.940
and she grew up on the moon.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:55.320
So she's not going to have
the exact same culture as you,

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:55.970
right?

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:57.870
And she is a little
bit of a tomboy,

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:02.700
but not in the sexy
male fantasy tomboy way,

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:04.400
but actually she's just gruff.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:07.790
Yeah.

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.050
So it was a real challenge.

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:11.060
And in the
acknowledgments is where

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:12.740
I thanked most of
those women who'd

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:16.340
helped me refine her and
make her a little bit more

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.837
female without losing the feel.

00:12:18.837 --> 00:12:19.670
JASON GESSNER: Sure.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.550
ANDY WEIR: And one of them
is a lady that I know.

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:26.270
She actually works for the
American embassy in London.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:29.540
And she gave me--
she is also a Muslim.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.020
So she was able-- there is--

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.670
Jazz herself is not
a practicing Muslim,

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:37.310
but her father is a
very devout Muslim.

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:40.730
And so I wanted to make
sure that everything

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.130
jived with how Islam works.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.931
And she checked all that
and I got all that right.

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:47.622
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:47.622 --> 00:12:49.580
JASON GESSNER: You
mentioned that you threw out

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.920
a couple of earlier
versions of the story.

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.590
Were any of the characters
that survived in the published

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:58.040
version the previous
protagonists?

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.230
ANDY WEIR: No.

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.740
Let me see.

00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:02.460
I'm running through
the protagonists.

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.540
So no, and no.

00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:04.290
JASON GESSNER: OK.

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:07.610
ANDY WEIR: Like the main
characters of the first two

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.366
versions of the
story are not even--

00:13:11.366 --> 00:13:14.438
don't even exist
in the main story.

00:13:14.438 --> 00:13:15.480
JASON GESSNER: All right.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:18.440
ANDY WEIR: However, my idea for
a sequel for "Artemis," which

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.720
is something I would
like to do someday,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.840
revolves around
the-- a guy named

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:28.400
Rudy, who, for the four of you
who read it, is kind of the cop

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.270
there.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.640
Artemis doesn't have
any laws, not really.

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:34.310
They're just a frontier town.

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.930
They have one kind
of security guy.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:39.665
He's a former RCMP?

00:13:39.665 --> 00:13:40.540
JASON GESSNER: Right.

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.480
ANDY WEIR: RCMP--

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.640
Mountie-- Royal Canadian M--

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:49.310
R-C-M-P, former member of the
RCMP, who retired and-- well,

00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:52.460
he's not old, but he left
the forest to become, like,

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:53.420
the cop in Artemis.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.480
He's very well respected.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.030
He's very fair, very honest.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:59.060
Honest to the point that--
yeah, and so he's actually

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.880
an antagonist for
Jazz in the story.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.630
But I thought it'd be
really cool to write

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:07.273
a story in my next book about
him solving a murder there.

00:14:07.273 --> 00:14:08.690
And I was going
to call it "Murder

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.600
on the Moon," which
unbelievably has never

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.490
been the title of anything.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:14.870
I mean, I googled it.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.380
I looked it up.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.180
I said, like, surely there's
been a movie or a TV show

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.470
episode or something.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:22.067
Just no.

00:14:22.067 --> 00:14:23.900
And I'm like, I want
to write this book just

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.425
to lay claim to that title.

00:14:25.425 --> 00:14:27.890
Like, "Murder on the Moon."

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:29.090
And I came up with a whole--

00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:30.960
I'll walk through the murder
and how it takes place,

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.990
and there's scientific
elements, and how it picks up

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:34.070
from where "Artemis" left off.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.487
And I pitched it
to the publisher,

00:14:35.487 --> 00:14:38.210
and the publisher said, nah.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:39.050
They didn't like it.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:39.800
JASON GESSNER: OK.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.520
ANDY WEIR: No free ride.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.400
JASON GESSNER: [LAUGHS]

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:42.440
ANDY WEIR: No free ride.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:42.830
What's that?

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:44.663
You wrote a book that
sold 5 million copies?

00:14:44.663 --> 00:14:48.470
Yeah, well, tell
me about this one.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.360
JASON GESSNER: Just a
clean slate each time?

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.420
ANDY WEIR: Well,
yeah, pretty much.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.260
Publishing-- you
know, book publishing

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.180
is very much a meritocracy.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.560
And they want to--

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.990
they don't want to
just publish a dud.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.135
They know that
people will buy kind

00:15:02.135 --> 00:15:03.940
of whatever I write
for a while, just

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:05.350
because I wrote "The Martian."

00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:08.110
But they would
rather it be a book

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:10.120
that's good and so that
people buy more of them,

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.950
so that everybody
makes more money.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:15.160
And what I get--
the advantage I get

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:20.710
from being successful in the
past is that I get in the room,

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:21.550
is that I'm there.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.100
And I get to talk to
the decision-makers

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.502
and say, here's my idea.

00:15:26.502 --> 00:15:28.430
JASON GESSNER: Cool.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:32.110
So one thing-- we talked
a little bit earlier about

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.245
how your background is
actually in software.

00:15:34.245 --> 00:15:34.870
ANDY WEIR: Yes.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.937
JASON GESSNER: Right?

00:15:34.937 --> 00:15:35.590
In software--

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:37.760
ANDY WEIR: 25 years as
a software engineer,

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:38.980
before I wrote.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:39.520
One clap?

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.020
One?

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:40.645
One micro-clap.

00:15:40.645 --> 00:15:42.430
JASON GESSNER: [LAUGHS]

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:43.930
ANDY WEIR: I did--
this was the same

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:46.347
as like playing to the crowd
by naming the city you're in,

00:15:46.347 --> 00:15:46.945
you know?

00:15:46.945 --> 00:15:48.480
It's like, software engineer!

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.370
JASON GESSNER: It definitely
seemed like a softball.

00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:50.946
ANDY WEIR: And this guy's like--

00:15:50.946 --> 00:15:54.750
Yeah, it was a lob
and I'm just-- oh.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.890
You people.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:59.990
JASON GESSNER: So software is
a very collaborative endeavor,

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.490
right?

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:01.157
ANDY WEIR: Yeah.

00:16:01.157 --> 00:16:03.465
JASON GESSNER: You did
that for a quarter century.

00:16:03.465 --> 00:16:04.090
Writing isn't--

00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:05.050
ANDY WEIR: There is no need--

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:05.925
JASON GESSNER: Sorry.

00:16:05.925 --> 00:16:07.420
ANDY WEIR: --to be putting it--

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:08.710
let's-- [LAUGHS]

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:11.240
JASON GESSNER:
No, no undertones.

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:11.740
You know--

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:12.520
ANDY WEIR: In my day--

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.710
JASON GESSNER: But writing a
novel is a much more solitary--

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:15.130
ANDY WEIR: It is.

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:16.780
JASON GESSNER: --adventure,
right, or endeavor.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.280
With "The Martian,"
because you were

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.650
publishing it
chapter by chapter,

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.688
you had a community around it.

00:16:22.688 --> 00:16:24.730
Could you talk a little
bit about that transition

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.810
from being in a, lack of a
better term, a team sport,

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:30.610
to a solo effort,
and how that was

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:33.070
different with "Artemis,"
which wasn't serialized

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:33.820
in the same way?

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:34.150
ANDY WEIR: Right.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.100
So there's like actually two
completely different things

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:36.350
there.

00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:37.570
And I'll answer them both.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.640
The first one was,
writing "The Martian,"

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.040
I posted it a chapter
at a time to my website.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.100
It was a labor of love.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:44.590
It was a thing I
was doing for fun

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:49.283
while I was working full time
in the software industry.

00:16:49.283 --> 00:16:50.950
For those of you who
don't know, I mean,

00:16:50.950 --> 00:16:54.550
I started writing
software professionally

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:55.720
in the late 1980s.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.700
[WHEEZE] It was
a different time.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:03.550
Michael Jackson was still black.

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:06.940
Anyway-- taken straight
from "Hot Tub Time Machine,"

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.450
that joke.

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:14.240
But so I'd been in the software
industry for a long time.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:17.230
The last 10 years of my career
were all in mobile development.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.810
So I wrote "The
Martian" while I--

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:22.720
one thing that helped a lot
was having no social life

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.660
whatsoever.

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.010
So I had a lot of free
time in the evenings.

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:27.840
You know, no girlfriend,
no real friends.

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.590
I'd moved to Boston
and so I didn't really

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.600
know anybody there.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.030
But that was a labor of love.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:37.410
And for the past 10 years, I
had been maintaining a website

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:41.470
with the web comics and short
stories that I'd written,

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:43.510
and it had a mailing
list and had accumulated

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:45.900
about 3,000 regular readers.

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.000
Yay for me.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:47.660
OK.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.320
Well, when I started
posting "The Martian"

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.930
a chapter at a time, my
readers are hardcore dorks,

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:55.930
so I was targeting
them with the writing.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:17:59.020
I was trying to make the writing
be extremely, meticulously,

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.720
scientifically accurate,
and showing the math,

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.530
because I know that's what that
sort of reader-- my people--

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.675
like to read.

00:18:07.675 --> 00:18:09.050
And so they would
send me-- there

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:10.930
is nothing a nerd
loves more than finding

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:12.730
an error in a fiction, right?

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.140
And so they would
tell me anytime

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:16.750
I got anything wrong-- math,
chemistry, you name it.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.353
And then it was cool,
since I was just

00:18:18.353 --> 00:18:20.020
writing it and posting
it to my website,

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.760
I'd go back and correct it.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.100
So I had this very, very
scientifically accurate thing.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.350
They also suggested all
sorts of really stupid plot

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:29.260
ideas, which I ignored.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.500
Engineers are not often very
good at plot generation,

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.700
but real good at math.

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:41.200
And so the end result was a
very, very well-fact-checked

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.160
story.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.407
And with "Artemis," I
didn't have that option,

00:18:44.407 --> 00:18:46.490
because "Artemis" was a
more traditional contract.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:49.060
It was like, you know, Random
House gave me an advance.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.860
I wrote the story just for them.

00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:52.870
And then they
published it, you know.

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:56.710
And so I didn't have
3,000 highly intelligent

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:57.790
fact-checkers.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:00.340
So the end result on that, the
only difference there was I

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:03.492
just had to be much, much, much
more careful in my research.

00:19:03.492 --> 00:19:05.200
For "The Martian," I
would just quickly--

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.680
I mean, I've often said that my
main research tool is Google.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:13.330
I mean, I know-- nowadays,
even when writing "Artemis,"

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:15.640
my main research
tool was Google.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:20.710
Because, like, I know lots of
people, lots of scientists,

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:21.710
lots of famous people.

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:24.280
I can call up Neil deGrasse
Tyson and ask him questions.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.140
But Google answers me faster.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:28.840
You know?

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:29.440
JASON GESSNER: Take that, Neil.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:31.648
ANDY WEIR: If I want to
know-- yeah, take that, Neil.

00:19:31.648 --> 00:19:33.820
If I want to know
the finer details

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.890
of an Uphoff-Crouch lunar
cycler, I can Google it.

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.615
And there it is.

00:19:38.615 --> 00:19:40.250
So I still end up doing that.

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:41.950
But I just had to be
a lot more thorough

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:43.240
with the fact-checking myself.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.657
I had to be like,
OK, I can't just

00:19:44.657 --> 00:19:46.293
trust the first few sites I see.

00:19:46.293 --> 00:19:47.710
I have to double
and triple check.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:49.483
I had to check all my
math multiple times

00:19:49.483 --> 00:19:51.400
because I didn't have
all those fact-checkers.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.980
And still a few mistakes did
get through, unfortunately.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:57.160
But nothing moon-shattering.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.090
JASON GESSNER: Sure.

00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:00.195
ANDY WEIR: See what I did there?

00:20:00.195 --> 00:20:01.570
I feel like that
was pretty good.

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.055
JASON GESSNER: [LAUGHS]

00:20:03.055 --> 00:20:04.510
ANDY WEIR: Tough room.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:05.410
OK.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:07.830
So that was one part
of the question.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.580
The other part was,
what was it like going

00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.520
from being in a team environment
in software engineering

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:16.290
to being a solo writer?

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:17.830
And the answer is,
that was actually

00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:19.690
the most difficult
transition for me.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:21.700
I'm a pretty social guy.

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.430
So first off, I really enjoyed
being a software engineer.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.410
It was a very rewarding job.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:27.890
I liked it a lot.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.310
I was in it for 25
years for a reason.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:32.330
That was a career that
really worked for me.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:32.500
JASON GESSNER: Sure.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.510
ANDY WEIR: I'd worked my way
up to like, architect level.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:35.470
I was good at it.

00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:37.720
I was respected by my
peers and my bosses.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.110
And, like, I just,
I really enjoyed it.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:44.530
And I also really enjoyed
working on a team,

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:46.840
always being part
of a team, you know?

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:50.365
And I liked going
in in the morning,

00:20:50.365 --> 00:20:52.240
grabbing a cup of coffee,
saying, hey, Steve,

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:52.860
how's your dog?

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:54.200
I heard he wasn't
feeling too good.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:54.867
Oh, he's better.

00:20:54.867 --> 00:20:55.720
Glad to hear it.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.180
Hey, Joe, how'd that
baseball game with your boy

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:58.840
go last week?

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.050
You know, just being a
part of a social group.

00:21:02.050 --> 00:21:04.270
The tight as-- I don't
know how many of you

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.220
are engineers
versus other tasks,

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:09.220
but for those of you who are
engineers, an engineering

00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:12.580
team working on a single project
is a really tight-knit group.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.800
And moving over to
writing, that was all gone.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.170
You know, I didn't go into
an office everyday anymore.

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.180
I just went into my home office.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.990
I didn't have people to
work with collaboratively

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.590
on a problem.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:24.790
I was on my own.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:26.800
I mean, I have people
that I work with.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.985
I have my editor.

00:21:27.985 --> 00:21:28.270
JASON GESSNER: Sure.

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.190
ANDY WEIR: I talk to
him-- my agent, actually.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:34.450
And I talk a lot about plot
direction and stuff like that.

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:35.560
My fiancee and I--

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.080
my fiancee is also a
writer, so we bounce ideas

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.940
off of each other, just to be
each other's sounding boards

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:41.440
and stuff.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:43.780
But it's not the same.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.485
It's not a team of engineers
breaking up a big problem

00:21:46.485 --> 00:21:48.610
into a bunch of little
problems and doling them out

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.270
and collaborating and stuff.

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.925
And I really, really miss that.

00:21:51.925 --> 00:21:54.220
That was the hardest part.

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.660
And yeah.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.540
And so one thing that
was pretty fun, though,

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:03.462
was last year I worked
on a TV show pitch,

00:22:03.462 --> 00:22:05.170
called-- it was going
to be a show called

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:07.870
"Mission Control," which
was about Mission Control.

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:11.650
And all the main characters
were the flight controllers

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.700
at Mission Control in Houston.

00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:18.430
And that was a writers' room
with a bunch of writers,

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:19.570
all working together on it.

00:22:19.570 --> 00:22:20.958
And that gave me
that feel again.

00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:22.000
I was like, this is cool.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.373
This is back to being--

00:22:23.373 --> 00:22:24.790
like being on an
engineering team.

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:27.130
There's a bunch of us all
working on a single thing.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:29.170
Unfortunately, the show
didn't get picked up.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:31.880
They did give us $10 million
to shoot a pilot, which we did.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.335
And I thought it was good,
but there were 450 pilots

00:22:34.335 --> 00:22:35.710
that season, and
ours was not one

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:37.210
of the ones they
decided to go with.

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:45.938
JASON GESSNER: So you have
a lot of technical detail

00:22:45.938 --> 00:22:46.480
in the books.

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.470
Obviously that
was something that

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.470
was really important to
you, that sort of helped

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:50.970
spur that original audience.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.720
Could you talk a little
bit about a couple

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.640
of the technical
challenges that you had

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:57.208
to investigate for "Artemis"?

00:22:57.208 --> 00:22:58.250
ANDY WEIR: For "Artemis"?

00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:59.140
OK.

00:22:59.140 --> 00:23:03.610
Well, so I wanted
the building of the--

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.190
so the biggest challenge was
making everything make sense

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:07.040
economically.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.040
That's-- I'm one of those
pedantic little shits,

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.250
when I look at something and
I'm like, where's the economics?

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:14.110
How's the economics
work out there?

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:15.130
Explain.

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:15.820
You know?

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.318
It's like-- and so, a lot
of times in science fiction

00:23:19.318 --> 00:23:20.860
and stuff like that,
I'm always like,

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.600
I'm just questioning
the economics.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.970
So for me, I'm like, OK,
how did Artemis get built?

00:23:24.970 --> 00:23:27.070
They didn't send the whole
damn city to the moon.

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:28.460
That's too expensive.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:30.250
They would make it out
of local materials.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:34.270
And I found out the moon
has an assload of aluminum.

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:36.010
Like, all of the aluminum.

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.730
So much aluminum.

00:23:37.730 --> 00:23:40.030
If you go to the moon
and you pick up a rock--

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:42.010
if you go to the
lunar highlands, which

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:44.730
is the bumpy parts, as opposed
to the smooth parts, right?

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:46.397
If you go to the bumpy
parts of the moon

00:23:46.397 --> 00:23:48.850
and you pick up a rock,
there is an 85% chance

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:51.460
that you just picked up a
mineral called anorthite.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:56.230
Anorthite is made of aluminum,
calcium, silicon, and oxygen.

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:58.960
It's very, very happy
being anorthite.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.960
That's why it's been that way
for 4 and 1/2 billion years.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.160
It's not a chemical
that wants to change.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:07.570
However, it will change if you
shove enough energy through it.

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:11.170
And what you can do is,
you can yank it apart

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:12.700
into its component elements.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.310
And that process, by the
way, is called smelting.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:16.810
That's what smelting is.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:20.270
They start with ore, and you
get refined metals out of it.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:23.770
So refining anorthite,
I said, like, OK.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.330
This is awesome
because it'll give us

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:26.372
a bunch of stuff we need.

00:24:26.372 --> 00:24:27.940
So how do you refine anorthite?

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:30.310
How do you turn that
into something useful?

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:32.560
And you would think that
smelting technology would all

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.180
be hundreds of years old, right?

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:38.140
I mean, we've been refining
metals since forever ago.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.620
Well, the primary process that
would be best for anorthite

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.450
is called the FFC
Cambridge process,

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:46.100
and it was invented in 1994.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.880
So technology's
always moving forward.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.630
And so I figured
out how that works.

00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:53.170
And I'm like, OK, so
this will separate it

00:24:53.170 --> 00:24:54.430
into its component elements.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:57.670
And so you would get
aluminum, calcium, silicon,

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:59.376
and oxygen, right?

00:24:59.376 --> 00:25:03.370
Notice I did this for
oxygen, because it's a gas.

00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:08.530
And-- which is amazing, because
it means it gives you aluminum

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:11.410
to build your moon base,
and then oxygen to fill it.

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:15.070
I mean, like, the moon
is made of moon bases,

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:17.650
just some assembly required.

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:22.610
That also gives you calcium,
which is not that useful.

00:25:22.610 --> 00:25:24.160
It actually is a
very good conductor,

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.200
if you wanted to make
wire, but it's also--

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.720
explodes when it touches
water, and there's

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:29.830
other problems with that.

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:31.630
But then there's
also silicon, so they

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:33.147
can make their own
glassware, which

00:25:33.147 --> 00:25:35.230
is also really handy if
you don't mind reacting it

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:36.400
with some of the oxygen.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.910
And boy, is there a lot
of oxygen. Just making

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:43.750
Artemis, the amount of aluminum
you need to make Artemis,

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:47.630
there's just so much oxygen you
can't breathe it fast enough.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:50.380
I mean, you'd be-- they'd
be venting oxygen out

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.260
into the vacuum outside
just to get rid of it.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.750
It's an absurd amount of
oxygen trapped in these rocks.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:57.640
So oxygen, not a problem.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:01.130
Also good to know, right?

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:04.492
And then I start going, like,
OK, so that's how they make it.

00:26:04.492 --> 00:26:05.950
That's the cheapest
way to make it.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:08.500
How much energy does it
take to smelt anorthite?

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.510
Oh, my god!

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:13.480
OK, so there are not
enough solar panels

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.600
to make that happen.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.020
You would have to pave the
moon with solar panels.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.570
You have to have
nuclear reactors.

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.100
There's no way to do this
without nuclear reactors.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.730
So that started-- that,
I'm sure is when I ended up

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:30.070
on all sorts of watch lists, as
I'm looking up nuclear reactors

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:33.310
and finding out what US Navy
ships use because those are

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:37.120
the smallest, most lightest,
most efficient nuclear reactors

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:38.012
that exist.

00:26:38.012 --> 00:26:39.970
And so I got some
information on that and said,

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.830
OK, Artemis is powered by
these two nuclear plants.

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.830
Then the problem becomes,
well, nuclear reactors

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:46.030
require a heat differential.

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:47.738
How do you get rid of
the heat in a world

00:26:47.738 --> 00:26:49.120
that doesn't have any water--

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.657
or air, for that matter?

00:26:50.657 --> 00:26:52.240
And so there is these
dadadadadadadah.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.440
It just keeps going.

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.123
But that was really fun.

00:26:56.123 --> 00:26:57.790
The lame part is where
I have to come up

00:26:57.790 --> 00:26:58.915
with characters in a story.

00:26:58.915 --> 00:26:59.802
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:59.802 --> 00:27:01.510
Now, what I would have
liked to have done

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:03.910
is just released a technical
schematic of Artemis

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:05.810
and called it a day.

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:07.637
But people probably
wouldn't buy that.

00:27:07.637 --> 00:27:08.470
JASON GESSNER: Yeah.

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:09.130
ANDY WEIR: Not as much.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:10.420
JASON GESSNER: Those
details come across--

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.962
ANDY WEIR: One guy
would, back there.

00:27:11.962 --> 00:27:12.850
He's like, I would.

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:14.350
JASON GESSNER: Those details
come across in the book,

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:15.947
but they're not
overbearing, either.

00:27:15.947 --> 00:27:17.530
ANDY WEIR: Yeah,
that's the hard part.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.290
Oh boy, is that hard,
because I do so much back--

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:23.507
I do so much work to
make everything work out,

00:27:23.507 --> 00:27:25.090
to make all the
science, all the math,

00:27:25.090 --> 00:27:28.400
everything has to work
for me to be happy.

00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.880
And then it ends up being
like a sentence in the book.

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.960
Because it's really
hard to resist the urge.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:35.980
It's like, look, it took me
a long time to work this out.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.140
It should take you a
long time to read it.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.280
But no.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.480
You have to-- you can do
all the math and stuff,

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.828
but you have to
just keep on task.

00:27:44.828 --> 00:27:46.870
JASON GESSNER: One of my
favorite details related

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:48.460
to the power was,
I think there's

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.502
a sentence where they're
like, well, what happens

00:27:50.502 --> 00:27:51.680
if the reactors explode?

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:53.560
Then they're like, ah, put
a bunch of dirt in the way.

00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:53.800
ANDY WEIR: Yep.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:54.880
JASON GESSNER: So
there's a giant berm.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.505
ANDY WEIR: Yep.

00:27:55.505 --> 00:27:56.020
That's it.

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.400
That's their safety.

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.950
Because there's-- Artemis
is a bunch of, like--

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:05.470
so Artemis' hulls are made of
6 centimeters of aluminum--

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:08.340
metric guy will appreciate this.

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.660
6 centimeters of
aluminum, a meter

00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.460
of crushed lunar rock--
just basically sand,

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:14.590
not processed at all.

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:16.270
Just straight-up
crushed lunar rock.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:18.610
And then another 6
centimeters of aluminum.

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:22.000
And the interstitial
space is divided up

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.130
into triangles like
a geodesic dome.

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:27.610
And the reason for that is,
I think, four-fold or so.

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:29.950
First off, it provides
thermal insulation.

00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:31.660
So the temperature
inside Artemis

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:33.580
doesn't really change
based on whether or not

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:36.250
it's day or night outside.

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:38.080
I figured out the
temperature gradient

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:42.582
to change 1 degree across
that would take like a century

00:28:42.582 --> 00:28:43.540
or something like that.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.750
It's amazing how much the
temperature, how much heat

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:49.870
does not want to move
through ground-up rock.

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:52.550
Number two is
radiation protection.

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:55.070
That'll protect against
background radiation

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:57.460
and solar radiation
to bring it down

00:28:57.460 --> 00:28:59.530
to kind of similar to
the levels of radiation

00:28:59.530 --> 00:29:00.700
on the surface of Earth.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.770
Number three is
physical protection

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:04.453
from micro-meteorites
and whatnot.

00:29:04.453 --> 00:29:06.370
But much more importantly,
physical protection

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:08.020
from the idiots who live inside.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.690
Because if you make
a city on the moon,

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:11.440
the greatest danger
to the whole integrity

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.640
are the people inside.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.660
Some guy pointing a
rivet gun the wrong way.

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:15.855
Oops, you know.

00:29:15.855 --> 00:29:17.980
The fourth thing it does
is it helps to radiate out

00:29:17.980 --> 00:29:22.600
the excess heat, because all the
energy that you use ultimately

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.120
becomes heat.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.870
Either it's a light
bulb that became heat,

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:27.412
or it's mechanical
motion that became

00:29:27.412 --> 00:29:28.720
friction that became heat.

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.420
Every jewel of energy that
goes in there becomes heat.

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:35.080
And so there are heat
regulators just pointed out.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.410
So Artemis is a compound,
if you think about it.

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:42.820
Like you could shoot RPGs at it
and still not breach the hull.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.860
And those two hulls
are each independently

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.200
capable of keeping
in an atmosphere.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.930
So a hull breach just means you
calmly get everybody else out

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:52.480
to other parts of the city,
seal off that section,

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.170
and like that.

00:29:53.170 --> 00:29:55.750
So the nuclear reactors
are about a kilometer away.

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:58.180
And they said, like, what
if there's a meltdown?

00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:59.680
Well, who gives a shit?

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.480
There is no water
table to contaminate.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.970
There's no life to hurt.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:06.290
There's-- we're already very,
very radiation-shielded.

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:08.960
So all we have to do is protect
against an actual physical

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.830
explosion.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:12.170
And they did that
by making a hill.

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:12.840
So that's it.

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.700
That's all they did.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.490
And these reactors
are just like,

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:18.382
not a lot of
shielding, but oh no.

00:30:18.382 --> 00:30:19.340
What are you going to--

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.080
oh, the ecology of the moon?

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.910
No.

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:24.170
Nobody gives a shit.

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:26.720
JASON GESSNER: Because your work
is very fact-based and it is

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:31.190
very rigid in that way--

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:34.220
but I'm curious, like, what
are your thoughts on sci-fi

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:40.510
as inspiration, both as you were
growing up and its role now?

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:42.600
Like, how has it changed?

00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:44.450
ANDY WEIR: Well, I think every--

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:48.117
basically every scientific idea
starts off as science fiction.

00:30:48.117 --> 00:30:50.700
It's just that the guy who came
up with it doesn't realize it.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.340
Anytime you sit there and go,
what if we use this to do that?

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.480
That's science fiction.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.070
You just did that in your mind.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:31:00.620
So eventually it
becomes science fact.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.440
It's just some people
then go off the deep end,

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.480
like me, and write an
entire book about the idea

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:08.090
instead of actually doing
something useful for society,

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:10.640
like working on the problem.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.980
But so I think that
science fiction is just

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:16.970
another way to say
speculation about the future.

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:21.650
In terms of its
role, I try not to--

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:25.850
I don't feel like I'm a
part of anything bigger.

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:28.892
I am just-- my
objective when I'm

00:31:28.892 --> 00:31:30.350
writing a book is
to make something

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:31.527
that people enjoy reading.

00:31:31.527 --> 00:31:33.110
And the only thing
I want you to think

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:35.437
when you put the book
away is, that was cool.

00:31:35.437 --> 00:31:36.020
And that's it.

00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.010
I'm not trying to change
your mind on anything.

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:38.780
I have no message.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:39.840
I have no moral.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.210
There is no politics.

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:43.490
There's no-- I'm not saying
we should work on this,

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:44.570
or do that, or anything.

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:47.270
I'm just saying,
hey, neat story idea.

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:50.030
And I want you to say,
hey, that was neat.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:51.410
That's it.

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:54.020
So I don't really
think of entertai--

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:55.910
I feel like
entertainment in general,

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:58.400
the entertainment
industry is kind of,

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.200
to be blunt, up its own ass.

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:02.990
It just-- there's
a lot of people

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:04.820
just really believe
that they are

00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:07.530
the social conscience
of the world

00:32:07.530 --> 00:32:09.020
and it's their job to guide.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:10.820
I don't buy into that.

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:12.860
I'm just about making
people have fun.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:14.360
JASON GESSNER: So
since you get sort

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:16.040
of pulled into that
anyway, though,

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.920
does that cause a lot
of tension for you?

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.523
Or you're just like,
no, that's not my bag.

00:32:21.523 --> 00:32:22.190
ANDY WEIR: Yeah.

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:25.010
For the most part, people
accept it when I say, nope.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.880
You know.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.370
It's like, well, what about
the political meaning?

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:28.670
There is no political meaning.

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:30.370
Well, what about the-- nope.

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:34.183
[LAUGHS] And there is
kind of an argument,

00:32:34.183 --> 00:32:36.350
especially in the science
fiction writing community,

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:38.150
about whether or
not science fiction

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:41.750
has a responsibility to be
some sort of standard-bearer

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:44.810
for morality or
progressiveness, or whatever.

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:48.980
And I guess on that, I
do say, well, yeah, I

00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:50.330
have a strong opinion on that.

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:52.100
No.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.940
I don't think it does.

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:59.300
I think it's just my job is
entertain, and nothing more.

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.530
Yeah.

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:02.780
JASON GESSNER: What were
some of the main inspirations

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.310
to you when you
were younger, then?

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:05.727
ANDY WEIR: Well,
I grew up reading

00:33:05.727 --> 00:33:07.670
my dad's science fiction
collection, which

00:33:07.670 --> 00:33:08.500
is interesting.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.230
So my dad--

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:11.070
I'm Gen X, my dad's
a baby boomer.

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:13.028
So I grew up one generation off.

00:33:13.028 --> 00:33:14.570
So the science
fiction that was being

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:17.060
written when I was a
teenager, I didn't read that.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:21.260
I read Heinlein, and
Arthur Clarke, and Asimov,

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:22.530
and stuff like that.

00:33:22.530 --> 00:33:24.540
And so I read my
dad's collection,

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:26.560
so the pages are
kind of yellowed.

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.190
And at the halfway
point, there's

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:31.970
an ad for Kent Cigarettes,
and stuff like that.

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.460
You know, black people are
called "colored" in the books.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.250
I mean, it's just like
these old, old books.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:39.920
But it was just that's
the science fiction

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.180
that I grew up with.

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.980
And what's interesting
is that was an era--

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:47.180
those guys wrote science fiction
that was very optimistic.

00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:51.500
Like there was an optimism to
sci-fi that was present then,

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.660
where it's like, oh,
I'm going to tell you

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:57.920
a story about this guy who
has an adventure in this world

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.820
where the whole solar system is
like, you know, is colonized.

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:03.890
And all these problems,
all these health problems

00:34:03.890 --> 00:34:04.400
have been solved.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.067
There's no such thing
as cancer anymore.

00:34:06.067 --> 00:34:08.500
But these guys have a problem
with these space pirates.

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.580
Yeah, yeah, it's awesome.

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:13.010
And now, science fiction
seems to have been taken over

00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:18.920
by bleak dystopian miseryscapes
with fascist governments,

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.139
and the only people
who can save us all

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:24.050
are a group of teenagers
doing something weird.

00:34:24.050 --> 00:34:26.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:31.014
And I'm like, when did science
fiction become so negative?

00:34:31.014 --> 00:34:32.389
Because I honestly
believe that--

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:34.010
I mean, I'm an optimistic guy.

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:35.870
I write optimistic stories.

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:38.449
I honestly believe that
humanity and Earth and science

00:34:38.449 --> 00:34:41.270
and everything just gets
better and better and better.

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:44.030
And if you don't believe me,
I put the thought experiment

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.570
to you--

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:48.150
would you rather live now
or a hundred years ago?

00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:50.480
You want to live a
hundred years ago, 1918?

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:52.850
Enjoy your Spanish flu.

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:54.966
Do you like tuberculosis?

00:34:54.966 --> 00:34:55.710
Hey.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:57.495
Hey, what ethnicity are you?

00:34:57.495 --> 00:34:59.870
Because you might not be able
to go into that restaurant,

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:00.370
you know.

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:03.370
And so it's like we just keep
getting better and better.

00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:05.440
Science, socially, everything.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.310
Just better and
better over time.

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:08.980
And so this notion
that we're somehow

00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:11.800
going to stop that upward trend
we've had for the past 5,000

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:15.410
years and go straight to
hell, I don't buy into that.

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:18.770
And so I just wish there was
a little more positive science

00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:19.270
fiction.

00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:21.790
And I think the best example
of positive science fiction

00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:23.650
out there is still "Star Trek."

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:25.030
Like, "Star Trek" is--

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:26.925
I mean, the problems
that the Enterprise

00:35:26.925 --> 00:35:28.300
have notwithstanding,
"Star Trek"

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:29.830
is a pretty bright future.

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:32.410
It would be awesome to live
on Earth in the "Star Trek"

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:33.250
universe.

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:36.420
I mean, there's no
problems at all.

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:37.300
There's no poverty.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.050
There's no hunger.

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:39.162
There's no disease.

00:35:39.162 --> 00:35:40.870
It's just like
everybody's got everything

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:42.040
they need taken care of.

00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:43.690
You're only endangered
if you decide

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:46.600
to go way out to the
fringes of Federation space

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.160
and start poking around, and--

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.150
JASON GESSNER: Sure.

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:51.005
Does it bug you that they
don't talk about the economics

00:35:51.005 --> 00:35:51.700
in "Star Trek"?

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:52.840
ANDY WEIR: Yes, it does.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.810
How the fuck does the
economics work in that?

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:56.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:58.568
In "Star Trek IV,"
Kirk's like, oh, we

00:35:58.568 --> 00:35:59.860
don't have money in the future.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.890
I'm like, how do
you conduct trade?

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:06.190
You just show up to the baker
with a bunch of chickens?

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:07.900
Here you go.

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:08.980
I don't get it.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.272
But you know, OK.

00:36:10.272 --> 00:36:12.730
JASON GESSNER: Yeah, there is
a hopefulness in "Star Trek."

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:13.397
ANDY WEIR: Yeah.

00:36:13.397 --> 00:36:15.640
And if there's one thing
that drives me crazy,

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:17.710
is just kind of technophobia.

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:20.560
Like the idea of any
technology is automatically bad

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:21.910
and will make you miserable.

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:25.450
Also known as the entirety
of "Black Mirror," right?

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:28.600
That show is just like, here's
how technology is always,

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:30.600
always 100% bad.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.300
And I don't buy that.

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.400
Yeah, technology is bad.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.190
As soon as we invented the
car, we invented the car crash.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:39.340
But we also invented
the ambulance, you know?

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:43.717
We do more good than harm with
technology, almost always.

00:36:43.717 --> 00:36:44.800
JASON GESSNER: Well, cool.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:46.670
So those are all
of my questions.

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:48.828
First off, thank you very much.

00:36:48.828 --> 00:36:49.870
Why don't we open it up--

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:52.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:57.100
AUDIENCE: You mentioned that you
had a bunch of female readers

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:58.750
read your book and
give you feedback.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:00.190
Do you have any
examples of things

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:02.770
that you got wrong that
they told you to fix?

00:37:02.770 --> 00:37:03.530
ANDY WEIR: Yeah.

00:37:03.530 --> 00:37:04.030
Sure.

00:37:04.030 --> 00:37:07.920
Like, at one point--

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:09.730
this one is
literally every woman

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:11.890
who read it flagged this one.

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:15.400
At one point, she was having
an argument with her dad.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.740
And she's 26, OK?

00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:20.470
And she was having an
argument with her dad

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:22.270
and she's like, oh, fuck you.

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:25.000
And everyone's like,
we get mad at our dads.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.130
We almost never
say, like, fuck you.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:28.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:30.940
You know, we'll say other stuff.

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.440
You know, women,
when they're having

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.857
an argument with
their fathers, it

00:37:33.857 --> 00:37:36.770
can get really emotional and
angry and stuff like that.

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:38.040
But just straight-up fuck you?

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.968
Mm, very rare.

00:37:40.968 --> 00:37:42.010
So they all flagged that.

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:44.230
So I changed that.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:47.800
And also just some
turns of phrase.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.220
Just the way certain
things that she

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:55.390
said that are things that,
like, a lot of the ladies

00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:56.530
who read it said, like, eh.

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.810
That's-- I mean, that's
an expression you hear all

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:00.352
the time and it's
not even offensive,

00:38:00.352 --> 00:38:03.340
but it's just a thing that guys
usually say and women usually

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:03.985
don't.

00:38:03.985 --> 00:38:07.538
So like small things like that.

00:38:07.538 --> 00:38:08.080
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.590
So thank you so much for coming.

00:38:09.590 --> 00:38:10.923
ANDY WEIR: Thanks for having me.

00:38:10.923 --> 00:38:13.220
AUDIENCE: I actually
just finished my--

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:15.970
a fiction novel, my first one.

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:16.690
And I--

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:17.860
ANDY WEIR: Congratulations.

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:18.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:21.500
ANDY WEIR: That's the
hardest part, is--

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.517
AUDIENCE: Well, I
actually would disagree.

00:38:23.517 --> 00:38:24.100
ANDY WEIR: OK.

00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:26.890
AUDIENCE: I'd say the hardest
part so far has been--

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:29.200
I'm just now in the process
of trying to get an agent.

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:29.900
ANDY WEIR: That is hard.

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:31.080
AUDIENCE: That is hard.

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.680
And I'd love to get
your perspective

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:37.880
on after you published in--
you know, it's in series.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:39.910
So that's technically
self-publishing.

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:40.953
Can you speak about that?

00:38:40.953 --> 00:38:43.120
And then can you speak about
getting an agent after?

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.160
And what you'd recommend.

00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:47.110
And I just would
love to be a sponge

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:47.870
and soak up everything you say.

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:48.550
ANDY WEIR: Sure.

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:50.770
Well, I definitely
recommend first trying

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:52.527
to get an agent through
the normal means.

00:38:52.527 --> 00:38:53.485
They all have websites.

00:38:53.485 --> 00:38:55.090
They all have
submission standards.

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:58.180
They actually-- you may
feel like they're not

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.700
reading what you send them,
but they are, I assure you.

00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:01.750
That's their whole job.

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:04.450
And so they're reading
them and evaluating them.

00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:08.865
A lot of them, when you get
your many rejection notices,

00:39:08.865 --> 00:39:10.780
a lot of them will tell
you what they didn't

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.970
like, which is very helpful.

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:15.310
Earlier in my career, if it
makes you feel any better--

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:17.560
"The Martian" is actually
the third book that I wrote.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.220
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.090
ANDY WEIR: The
first book I wrote

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:20.050
was called "The Observer."

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:21.508
I wrote that when
I was in college.

00:39:21.508 --> 00:39:24.520
Thank god I wrote it before
the era of the internet,

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.502
so it's not out there.

00:39:25.502 --> 00:39:26.710
None of you will ever see it.

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:28.150
It's awful.

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:30.700
It's awful.

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:33.220
It's oh-ful, OK?

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:35.110
And then the second
book that I ever wrote

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:37.320
was called "Theft
of Pride," which--

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:40.240
so basically, when I was
working for America Online

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:44.620
back in 1999, I got laid off
when they merged with Netscape.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.480
Yes.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:48.230
It was a different time.

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:49.360
The Macarena was popular.

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:55.360
So I got laid off and
I had a bunch of money

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.630
from stock options.

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:58.840
And so I said, I'm going to
be a professional writer.

00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:59.643
Yay, me.

00:39:59.643 --> 00:40:01.060
And so I spent
three years writing

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.645
this book, "Theft
of Pride," and then

00:40:02.645 --> 00:40:03.770
trying to get it published.

00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:06.490
And that is when I had
my standard tale of woe

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:09.040
that every author has, which
is rejection, rejection,

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.210
rejection, rejection.

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:12.910
And then I eventually went back
into the software industry.

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:14.912
But it wasn't a sad,
Charlie-Brown-music,

00:40:14.912 --> 00:40:16.870
hang-your-head thing,
because I loved software.

00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:19.150
I just-- I said, I
have an opportunity

00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:20.830
to pursue this dream.

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:21.580
I did.

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.400
It didn't work out.

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:25.980
OK, back to the career that
I already enjoyed anyway.

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:31.300
But so I went through it
too, and I know how it feels.

00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.160
But what's awesome
now is that there

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:36.910
is no longer an old-boy network
between you and the readers.

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:38.730
If you can't get through
on the tradition--

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:43.030
on the old-school approach
of finding an agent,

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:45.430
getting a publisher,
stuff like that,

00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:48.190
then go ahead and try
to publish it directly.

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:50.620
Amazon is easy.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:54.040
It's, you post it up there,
they hang onto it for 24 hours

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.020
to make sure it's not
goat porn or something.

00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:59.740
And then-- they just want
to categorize it correctly

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.072
if it is, you know.

00:41:01.072 --> 00:41:02.836
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:02.836 --> 00:41:03.940
And then--

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:04.210
AUDIENCE: One of those comps.

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:05.290
ANDY WEIR: --they
put it up there--

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:06.540
they put it up there for sale.

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:07.300
You can charge--

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:09.790
I recommend that if you go
the self-publishing route,

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:11.590
since you're trying
to accumulate readers

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:13.007
at this point,
don't go for money.

00:41:13.007 --> 00:41:14.210
Go for readership.

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:16.960
So set the price to the absolute
minimum, which is $0.99,

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:19.510
or it was when I
published "The Martian,"

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:22.330
and see if you can get
some traction that way.

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:25.090
But it's nice because
it costs you zero.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:26.410
It costs you nothing.

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:30.310
And that is a big change
from the way publishing was

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:32.920
up until this modern
era, is that--

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:35.350
it used to be if you
really believed in a book

00:41:35.350 --> 00:41:37.660
and no one would publish it,
you would vanity press it.

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:40.300
And then you're putting
thousands, tens of thousands

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.280
of your own dollars into it.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.650
You no longer have to do that.

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:48.250
But definitely try the
traditional route first,

00:41:48.250 --> 00:41:52.380
because it can't be overstated
how useful a publisher is,

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:54.650
in terms of marketing
and publicity.

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:58.160
They can get so many more
people to hear about your work

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.993
than you can on your own,
that it's just no comparison.

00:42:01.993 --> 00:42:03.410
And the last thing
I would say is,

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:06.530
don't go directly
to a publisher.

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:07.203
Get an agent.

00:42:07.203 --> 00:42:09.620
If you can't find an agent,
then consider self-publishing.

00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:11.750
But going directly
to a publisher, that

00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.570
will end up in a
slush pile in a room,

00:42:14.570 --> 00:42:16.910
in a back room
that is forgotten,

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:18.780
you know, next to the
Ark of the Covenant.

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:22.500
So that's my advice.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.083
AUDIENCE: Can I ask
one more question?

00:42:24.083 --> 00:42:25.875
ANDY WEIR: No one seems
to be fighting you.

00:42:25.875 --> 00:42:26.480
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.030
Can you speak a little bit
about your relationship

00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:32.540
with your editor and how--

00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:34.850
do you even have one
with "The Martian"?

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:37.490
And then, how is
that transformed,

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:39.440
and how influential has
that been in your work

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.480
with "Artemis"?

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.330
ANDY WEIR: Yeah.

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:42.980
So for "The Martian,"
the entire book

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:45.720
was done before Random
House got involved.

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.180
But then, I mean,
I had an editor

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:52.220
and he went through and sent
me a big pile of red ink

00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:54.470
with some paper in between it.

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:57.200
And so I went through the
process of editing it.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:59.410
It wasn't that bad.

00:42:59.410 --> 00:43:00.905
For "Artemis" it
was very different

00:43:00.905 --> 00:43:02.780
because I would send
him a chapter at a time.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:03.930
I didn't have to do that.

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:06.788
He was happy to just say, send
it to me when you're done.

00:43:06.788 --> 00:43:08.330
But I was sending
it to him a chapter

00:43:08.330 --> 00:43:09.660
at a time and stuff like that.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:12.650
And I have a great
relationship with my editor.

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:13.850
His name is Julian Pavia.

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:16.940
He works for Random
House in New York City.

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:21.230
And I think he really works
hard to make good stories.

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:24.013
He doesn't have a focus on
demographics or market shares,

00:43:24.013 --> 00:43:24.930
or anything like that.

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:25.950
He doesn't care
about any of that.

00:43:25.950 --> 00:43:28.080
He's just like, how do we
make this a good story?

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:29.450
And he'll point out problems.

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:32.670
And damn it, every time he
points something out, I'm like,

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:33.780
you're right.

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:34.880
And I just like--

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.490
I've never had him
point out something

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:39.890
that I really disagreed with.

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:42.180
And I'm like, ooh, fucker.

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:46.190
But we don't butt
heads very often.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:48.440
My only complaint about
him is that sometimes it

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.320
just seems like
I just can't find

00:43:51.320 --> 00:43:53.270
anything that makes him happy.

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:54.980
Sometimes it feels that way.

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:57.590
But yeah, it's an
interesting relationship.

00:43:57.590 --> 00:44:00.890
But this is where being a
software engineer for so long

00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:01.850
comes into play.

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:05.070
I mean, I'm used to
collaborative work.

00:44:05.070 --> 00:44:06.620
I'm used to having to re--

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:09.170
I'm used to making a product
and then presenting it

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:12.380
to a higher-up, who
then wants to make

00:44:12.380 --> 00:44:13.670
a bunch of arbitrary changes.

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:15.803
And then you go [INAUDIBLE]
and you go make them.

00:44:15.803 --> 00:44:16.470
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:17.140
ANDY WEIR: Yeah.

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:17.930
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:18.380
ANDY WEIR: Sure thing.

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:19.172
Good luck.

00:44:19.172 --> 00:44:20.630
AUDIENCE: So between
the two books,

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:23.870
it seemed to me like there
was quite a bit of difference

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:24.590
in the tone.

00:44:24.590 --> 00:44:27.890
I thought "The Martian" had a
lot of levity, a lot of humor

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:28.760
in it.

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.680
Seems like maybe that's a
little bit of your personality,

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:31.972
as we've been listening to you.

00:44:31.972 --> 00:44:33.140
ANDY WEIR: Mark is me.

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:34.040
I admit it.

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.610
Well, Mark is the idealized me.

00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:38.390
He's all the parts of
my personality I like,

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:40.880
and none of the parts
of me that I don't like.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:42.800
He's what I wish I could be.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.300
And pretty much
every main character

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:45.717
is someone the
author wants to be,

00:44:45.717 --> 00:44:47.350
or someone the author
wants to screw.

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:49.100
And if you don't believe
me, pick any book

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:49.975
and think it through.

00:44:49.975 --> 00:44:51.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:52.730
By the way, I want to be Mark.

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:54.482
Just FYI.

00:44:54.482 --> 00:44:55.940
AUDIENCE: All right,
so now I think

00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:58.152
my question is really weird.

00:44:58.152 --> 00:45:00.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:04.340
So "Artemis," I
think has kind of a--

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:05.090
ANDY WEIR: Darker.

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:06.050
AUDIENCE: --like a darker tone.

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:08.150
And I wondered if, like,
was that deliberate?

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:09.340
Something you set out to do?

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:11.560
Did that evolve naturally?

00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.510
ANDY WEIR: It evolved
naturally and the reason

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:17.600
is because, like I was saying
before, I really wanted--

00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:20.150
my main goal for myself
on writing "Artemis"

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:22.580
was to make deeper,
more complex characters.

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:25.150
To make characters
who are more flawed

00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:27.530
and have deep
psychological things

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:29.810
that the reader understands,
and then undergoes

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:31.010
change and growth.

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:33.230
And so while Mark
is the idealized me,

00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:35.520
Jazz is really more
like the real me.

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.440
So a lot of the
problems that Jazz has,

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:42.380
and a lot of her behavior, is
stuff that I do or have done.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:45.680
And like her strained
relationship with her father.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.680
That's straight out of my life.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.330
The fact that she's--

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:52.970
a recurring theme in the book
is that she's really, really,

00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:56.485
really intelligent, but
doesn't apply it nearly enough.

00:45:56.485 --> 00:45:57.860
And people are
always saying, you

00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:59.027
could be doing so much more.

00:45:59.027 --> 00:46:00.800
And she's like, fuck off.

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:01.430
You know.

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:05.180
And that's-- she's kind
of the darker side of me.

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:07.580
So you remember that
episode of "Star Trek" where

00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:10.700
Captain Kirk gets
split into his good guy

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.412
half and his evil half?

00:46:12.412 --> 00:46:14.870
And he's wandering around,
there are two Kirks on the ship,

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:15.710
and stuff like that?

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:20.710
That's kind of like Mark
Watney and Jazz Bashara for me.

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:22.670
AUDIENCE: So in the
movie "The Martian,"

00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:28.308
it seemed like the humor was
maybe exaggerated more than

00:46:28.308 --> 00:46:30.100
what it came across in
the book and I was--

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:30.770
ANDY WEIR: Hm.

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:31.812
AUDIENCE: At least to me.

00:46:31.812 --> 00:46:34.050
So you seem like you're
disagreeing with that.

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:36.900
I was going to ask you
how you felt about that.

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:39.860
But maybe you disagree
with my analysis.

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:44.260
ANDY WEIR: I guess I disagree,
but there is no wrong answer

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:45.555
in critical analysis.

00:46:45.555 --> 00:46:46.430
I mean, except yours.

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:47.100
That was wrong.

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:47.600
But--

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:50.400
--no, I disagree.

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.870
I think the humor came
across pretty well.

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:58.930
That having been said, you
know, film and literature

00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:02.320
are two very, very different
media for conveying stories.

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:04.270
You have to do things
differently in a film.

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:07.585
I was very happy with how
the movie came across,

00:47:07.585 --> 00:47:11.170
so I'm certainly-- certainly
got no complaints about that

00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:12.197
whatsoever.

00:47:12.197 --> 00:47:13.030
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:15.100
ANDY WEIR: Mhm.

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.380
AUDIENCE: So you're a pretty
technical person, right?

00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:21.100
So I'm just wondering, did you
hack the writing process a lot?

00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:24.010
Or did your room look
like something from--

00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:25.510
ANDY WEIR: Serial
killer's basement?

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:26.350
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:27.880
Like you're getting
the Unabomber

00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:30.310
with all the red thread
pointing everywhere.

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:33.205
Or is it like you have
a Google Doc, right?

00:47:33.205 --> 00:47:35.080
ANDY WEIR: Not a Google
Doc, because I didn't

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:35.890
want to share it with anybody.

00:47:35.890 --> 00:47:36.610
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:42.890
ANDY WEIR: But I do have a
directory full of spreadsheets.

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:47.290
So mostly I have
like Excel docs.

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:50.630
Just tons and tons of math, all
that stuff is done like that.

00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:54.130
But yes, I also
have a whiteboard--

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:56.110
a magnetic whiteboard
with things

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:58.450
that I'll print out, like
a little map of Artemis

00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:00.037
and stuff like that.

00:48:00.037 --> 00:48:01.870
AUDIENCE: Was that
exaggerated for "Artemis"

00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:06.940
versus "The Martian," where you
add like blog-style writing?

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.910
ANDY WEIR: Well, yeah, "Artemis"
was much more serial killer-y.

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:10.180
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:11.555
ANDY WEIR: A lot
of "Artemis" has

00:48:11.555 --> 00:48:13.300
to do with distances
and locations.

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:14.550
And it's like, oh god, she's--

00:48:14.550 --> 00:48:15.252
OK, she's here.

00:48:15.252 --> 00:48:16.210
She needs to get there.

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:17.290
How long does that take?

00:48:17.290 --> 00:48:19.220
And that becomes plot-critical.

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:21.130
And so the map really
mattered a lot.

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:24.220
In "The Martian," it was really
just all about spreadsheets.

00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:26.770
And I wrote some
software of my own

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:29.657
for calculating the orbital
trajectories that people took.

00:48:29.657 --> 00:48:31.030
AUDIENCE: That's awesome.

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:32.572
One quick question
in follow-up, too,

00:48:32.572 --> 00:48:34.580
is, do you have Matt
Damon's phone number?

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:37.420
ANDY WEIR: I don't
have his phone number.

00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:40.300
I did meet him many times during
the publicity and marketing

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:40.848
for the film.

00:48:40.848 --> 00:48:42.640
He's very-- that's
usually what people ask.

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:43.450
What's Matt Damon like?

00:48:43.450 --> 00:48:44.330
Well, I'll tell you.

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:46.150
He's very nice.

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:49.830
He's as polite to the waiter
as he is to the director.

00:48:49.830 --> 00:48:51.760
He's just a generally
nice person,

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.510
and he's also very introverted.

00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:55.690
He is.

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:56.530
He's really quiet.

00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:59.080
And you can tell, at these
marketing events, none of us

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:02.080
are at our best because
we've all traveled

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.510
and we're all-- none of us
really want to be there.

00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:07.760
You know, we're all just, OK,
yeah, we're here to do this.

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.143
And you can tell he would--

00:49:09.143 --> 00:49:10.310
he's very nice to everybody.

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:11.020
He's very polite.

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:12.562
And he very much
would rather be just

00:49:12.562 --> 00:49:15.070
at home with his wife
and kids, relaxing.

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:17.310
AUDIENCE: First off, a TV
show about Mission Control

00:49:17.310 --> 00:49:17.990
sounds really cool.

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:19.115
I would kill to watch that.

00:49:19.115 --> 00:49:20.170
ANDY WEIR: Thanks!

00:49:20.170 --> 00:49:22.337
I mean, you don't-- you
shouldn't really kill people

00:49:22.337 --> 00:49:23.680
for it, but I mean--

00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:25.300
AUDIENCE: So my
question is just,

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:28.200
how much time did
you spend developing

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.430
the science and the
characters of "Artemis"

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:33.593
before you actually sat down
and started writing chapters?

00:49:33.593 --> 00:49:36.010
ANDY WEIR: That's an interesting
question because, I mean,

00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:39.920
I spent a good couple of months
working on those dead-end plot

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:42.490
line ideas before I got there.

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:46.780
Now, the science I blew through
in like a few weeks of just--

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:48.400
that stuff is so fun to me.

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:52.620
I just-- I'll just stay up
late working on that crap.

00:49:52.620 --> 00:49:55.750
But the characters and stuff,
that was time-consuming.

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:58.900
Also at the same time, I was
working on a different book.

00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:00.880
Between "The "Martian
and "Artemis,"

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.920
I was working on a
book called "Zhek."

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:06.010
And that was about
aliens invading Earth.

00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:08.980
And it was like a complete
departure from the hard sci-fi

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:10.150
that I was used to.

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:12.520
And I got about
70,000 words into it--

00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:15.740
for reference, "The "Martian
is 100,000 words, 105,000.

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:17.680
So I got about 70,000
words into "Zhek"

00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.920
over the course of a year.

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:22.660
And I realized one day, I'm
like, oh dear, this sucks.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:25.240
And I told my
editor, I'm like, I'm

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.802
concerned that "Zhek" sucks.

00:50:27.802 --> 00:50:30.010
Would it be OK if I wrote
a completely different book

00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:31.840
and you added a
year to my deadline?

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:33.145
And he said, sure, go ahead.

00:50:33.145 --> 00:50:35.020
Because he'd been reading
the chapters and he

00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.360
also knew that "Zhek" sucked.

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:36.860
So--

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:38.605
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:38.605 --> 00:50:40.480
--he was actually very
comfortable with that.

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:44.240
But while I was bungling
around trying to fix "Zhek"--

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:44.740
and I did.

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:47.410
I spent a lot of time trying
to make it work as a story--

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:50.560
I was also cheating on it
by going over and working

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:51.370
on "Artemis."

00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:53.530
So it's hard for me to
give a quantitative answer

00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:56.380
because I kind of split my time.

00:50:56.380 --> 00:51:00.250
AUDIENCE: So the question
I had was about the film

00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:03.315
adaptation and what--

00:51:03.315 --> 00:51:04.940
you've probably been
asked this before,

00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:07.000
but what are your just
general thoughts on that?

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.360
And also, I'm curious
kind of how they reach out

00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:12.790
to you on that,
and wanting to turn

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:15.130
the book into a movie,
and kind of the process

00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:16.660
of that happening.

00:51:16.660 --> 00:51:19.030
ANDY WEIR: They send a
jewel-encrusted helicopter.

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:20.110
No.

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:23.350
So what happened was, while we
were negotiating the book deal

00:51:23.350 --> 00:51:26.780
with Random House, Fox wanted
the film rights, right then.

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.140
Like they came-- like it was
still just a self-published

00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:31.690
book on Amazon when Fox--

00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:33.550
for those of you who
don't understand,

00:51:33.550 --> 00:51:36.250
the way movie options
work, is what they're doing

00:51:36.250 --> 00:51:38.230
is they're paying you
a small amount of money

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:42.110
to have the exclusive ability
to buy the film rights from you.

00:51:42.110 --> 00:51:44.313
So it's not like you're
just rolling in money

00:51:44.313 --> 00:51:45.730
and they're going
to make a movie.

00:51:45.730 --> 00:51:48.160
It's like, we may or may
not want to make a movie out

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:50.770
of this, but we're going
to secure it by giving you

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:52.000
a small amount of money.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.580
You pre-negotiate the entire
contract, the whole purchase

00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:56.080
contract in advance.

00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.205
And we're going to give
you a small amount of money

00:51:58.205 --> 00:52:00.730
to be the only people who can
buy the rights for the next,

00:52:00.730 --> 00:52:01.690
like, 18 months.

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:02.590
It expires.

00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:04.323
And we can buy the
rights at any time

00:52:04.323 --> 00:52:06.490
just by activating this
contract and then giving you

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:09.050
the big pile of money.

00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:10.990
So when they came
for the film option,

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:12.880
it wasn't that
big of a surprise.

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.250
Movie studios buy film option--
they'll throw those out

00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:17.140
and they're like
breath mints to them.

00:52:17.140 --> 00:52:19.515
I mean, it's a lot of money
to me, but to them it's like,

00:52:19.515 --> 00:52:20.530
pfft, here.

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:21.950
Go buy yourself
something pretty.

00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:23.833
You know.

00:52:23.833 --> 00:52:25.000
But they bought film rights.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.560
And so those two deals were
going on at the same time.

00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:29.018
And the book deal
and the film deal

00:52:29.018 --> 00:52:30.490
came together four days apart.

00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:32.532
And that was a-- you know,
and I was, by the way,

00:52:32.532 --> 00:52:33.970
still working as an engineer.

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:35.380
So I'm in my
cubicle fixing bugs,

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:36.820
then running off to
a conference room,

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.570
take a call about my
movie deal, then back

00:52:38.570 --> 00:52:39.930
to my cubicle to fix bugs.

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:41.470
It was a surreal time.

00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:44.600
But anyway, as the
movie progressed--

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.470
there's never a moment
when you pop the champagne.

00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:48.670
It's just bit by bit.

00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:50.380
They're like, oh, we got a guy.

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:53.530
We've got a potential
screenwriter.

00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:55.120
So we're going
to-- you know, he's

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.412
going to start working on that.

00:52:56.412 --> 00:52:56.920
Oh, OK.

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:57.647
We think we may--

00:52:57.647 --> 00:52:59.105
we've got a pretty
good screenplay.

00:52:59.105 --> 00:53:00.860
The studio is like,
well, we're not--

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:03.640
it's so heavily dependent
on one character

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:06.070
that we're not going to
make it at all unless you

00:53:06.070 --> 00:53:08.122
can get a big name
to play that one guy.

00:53:08.122 --> 00:53:10.330
And it's like, OK, we pitched
it to Robert Downey Jr.

00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:11.830
and he said no.

00:53:11.830 --> 00:53:15.518
And then, so then
they're, we're going

00:53:15.518 --> 00:53:17.560
to pitch it to Matt Damon
next, see what he says.

00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:18.622
Matt Damon said yes.

00:53:18.622 --> 00:53:19.330
I was like, what?

00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:22.228
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:26.350
And then they had Drew
Goddard lined up to direct,

00:53:26.350 --> 00:53:30.310
but then he left to go work
on Sony's next "Marvel" movie.

00:53:30.310 --> 00:53:32.390
And so then they're
like, OK, well,

00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:34.870
we've got Matt Damon interested,
but we need a director.

00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:36.590
And then Ridley Scott said yes.

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:37.907
And I said, what?

00:53:37.907 --> 00:53:40.490
And so then the studio started
to-- and it starts to snowball,

00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:41.890
but there's never a moment.

00:53:41.890 --> 00:53:44.110
And they're like, OK, well,
they're talking about,

00:53:44.110 --> 00:53:45.640
they're doing some
concept sketches.

00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.580
OK, well, Ridley's
meeting with that.

00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:50.128
OK, well, now
Jessica Chastain is

00:53:50.128 --> 00:53:51.670
interested in playing
Commander Lewis

00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:54.128
and we're starting to get a
cast together, but none of this

00:53:54.128 --> 00:53:56.332
means that we're actually
going to make the movie.

00:53:56.332 --> 00:53:57.790
And then, OK, well,
eventually it's

00:53:57.790 --> 00:54:01.990
like, well, we've leased some
studio space in Budapest.

00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:04.157
It's like, OK, well,
we're making sets now.

00:54:04.157 --> 00:54:05.740
I'm like, well,
that's good, isn't it?

00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:07.532
Yeah, but it doesn't
always, eh, you know--

00:54:07.532 --> 00:54:08.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:11.800
And then eventually they
shot the first scene.

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.780
And that's when you kind
of pop the champagne.

00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:15.610
Because once they
shoot the first scene,

00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:19.060
they're on the hook to pay
all the actors all the money.

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:21.280
And that's the expensive
part, is the salaries

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:22.330
that the actors make.

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:25.150
So once they shoot that
first scene, then it--

00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:27.340
even if they wanted to stop,
the cheaper thing to do

00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:30.410
is just power through and make
the movie to offset the costs.

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:33.100
And that's when they gave me the
big pile of money, too, which

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:33.820
was awesome.

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:34.580
I recommend it.

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:35.080
And--

00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.653
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:37.653 --> 00:54:39.820
--another thing that I get
asked a lot is, like, OK,

00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:42.280
how were you involved in the
process of making the movie?

00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.870
My job was to cash the check.

00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:45.370
That's it.

00:54:45.370 --> 00:54:47.927
Like, once you yield the--
once you sell the film rights,

00:54:47.927 --> 00:54:49.510
they don't have to
talk to you at all.

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:52.450
They chose to include me,
though, which was pretty cool.

00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:54.050
When Drew was writing
the screenplay,

00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:55.840
he was on the phone
with me every day,

00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:57.850
usually with
technical questions,

00:54:57.850 --> 00:54:59.860
although sometimes
the story questions.

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:02.155
Ridley would also--
it took me a long time

00:55:02.155 --> 00:55:04.780
to get used to the fact, by the
way, that in Hollywood everyone

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:06.610
calls each other by first names.

00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:08.932
And so I'm like, man,
everybody's such a douche.

00:55:08.932 --> 00:55:11.140
They're talking about these
incredibly famous people,

00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:12.765
and they're like,
oh, Matt, oh, Ridley.

00:55:12.765 --> 00:55:15.400
And then after like two
weeks in that environment,

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:16.337
you're doing it too.

00:55:16.337 --> 00:55:17.920
So pardon me if I
sound like a douche,

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.170
but this is just how they do it.

00:55:20.170 --> 00:55:23.980
So Ridley Scott
would be calling me,

00:55:23.980 --> 00:55:26.500
sending questions
through intermediaries

00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:28.213
with technical stuff.

00:55:28.213 --> 00:55:30.130
But for the most part,
they certainly didn't--

00:55:30.130 --> 00:55:31.960
I had no authority whatsoever.

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:33.590
And I had no say over anything.

00:55:33.590 --> 00:55:35.590
But I'm very happy
with how it turned out.

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:37.410
As excited spectator
on the sidelines.

00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:38.170
Yay!

00:55:38.170 --> 00:55:39.967
Go team!

00:55:39.967 --> 00:55:41.050
JASON GESSNER: Well, cool.

00:55:41.050 --> 00:55:45.780
So everybody, let's give a big
round of applause for Andy.

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.830
[APPLAUSE]
