00:00:00.283 --> 00:00:02.384
- [Voiceover] So, we're
sold that suppose a plus b

00:00:02.384 --> 00:00:03.661
is equal to zero.

00:00:03.661 --> 00:00:06.253
Which of these expressions
equal a times b?

00:00:06.253 --> 00:00:07.418
And like always, pause the video,

00:00:07.418 --> 00:00:08.707
and see if you can figure it out.

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:11.263
These are actually pretty fun problems.

00:00:11.882 --> 00:00:12.951
Alright, so, let's see if we can

00:00:12.951 --> 00:00:14.310
do a little bit of manipulation.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.001
So, we're told that a
plus b is equal to zero.

00:00:18.552 --> 00:00:21.705
So, if we subtract b from both sides,

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:23.262
we would get.

00:00:23.262 --> 00:00:26.082
So, if I subtract b from both sides,

00:00:26.082 --> 00:00:29.809
I would get a is equal to negative b.

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:32.520
So, what is a time b equal to?

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.181
So, a times b.

00:00:34.181 --> 00:00:35.655
Well, I could write this a few ways.

00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:39.452
I could substitute the
a with a negative b,

00:00:39.452 --> 00:00:41.980
since we know a is equal to negative b.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.030
In which case, a times b
would be negative b times b,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.846
which is equal to negative b squared.

00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:53.668
Another option is I could

00:00:54.645 --> 00:00:56.642
instead of saying a is
equal to negative b,

00:00:56.642 --> 00:01:00.044
I could say that b is equal to negative a

00:01:00.044 --> 00:01:02.945
if we multiply both
sides times negative one.

00:01:02.945 --> 00:01:05.199
So, b is equal to negative a.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.867
And so, instead of substituting
a, I could substitute b

00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:11.537
with negative a.

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:14.347
And so, this expression
would be a times negative a,

00:01:15.419 --> 00:01:17.974
a times negative a,

00:01:17.974 --> 00:01:20.575
which is equal to negative a squared.

00:01:20.575 --> 00:01:23.036
So, let's see, which of
these choices are there?

00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:25.473
There's a b squared, by
not negative b squared.

00:01:25.473 --> 00:01:27.678
So, we see the negative a
squared right over there.

00:01:27.678 --> 00:01:29.073
So, I'm feeling good.

00:01:29.073 --> 00:01:31.969
I'm feeling good about that choice.
