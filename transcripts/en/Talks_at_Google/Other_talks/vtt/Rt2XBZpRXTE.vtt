00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.380
MING: Good afternoon,
my friends.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.320
About right years ago,
Grace joined Google

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.250
as a massage therapist.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:11.040
And when she was
new here, it was

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.000
very easy to get on the
calendar, which I did.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.190
So I go on the calendar, and
I took a massage from her,

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.610
and she was so good.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.810
And then I kept
going back to her.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.920
And behind her back, I started
calling her Amazing Grace.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.890
And I made one
big mistake, which

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.600
is, I started telling
all my friends.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.150
And then after that I couldn't
get on the calendar any more.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.350
So in retrospect, I should have
done one of two things, right?

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.050
I should have not
told my friends,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.660
or I should have fewer friends.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.300
Either way, Grace
became very popular.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.142
Good thing is we were
friends since almost day one,

00:00:51.142 --> 00:00:52.350
and then we remained friends.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.900
And most of our
conversations were

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.240
about spirituality, philosophy,
and important stuff like that.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.490
And then, couple years
back, about two years back,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.589
I met Steve.

00:01:06.589 --> 00:01:08.130
Let me see, we were
speaking together

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.840
at the World Peace Festival--
World Peace Festival--

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.130
in, of all places, Germany.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.822
Sorry.

00:01:14.822 --> 00:01:15.530
Those are German?

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.820
Sorry.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.510
And so the bad news
is, world peace

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.679
did not come out
of that conference.

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:24.470
Yes, we didn't have
world peace after that.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.820
But the good news is,
Steve and I became friends.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.590
And then later on, when I found
out that Steve was American,

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.410
he was working in
Germany at the time.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.650
And later on, I found out he
was coming back to the US.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.590
And he was going to set up shop.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.150
He was going to start
the Wellstone Center

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.180
in Santa Cruz, where Grace was.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.850
And I was like, these two
people to have to meet,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.360
because together they
can make things happen.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.484
So I got them to meet, and this
came out, among other things.

00:01:55.484 --> 00:01:56.900
This came out, the
book that we're

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.170
going to talk about today.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.520
The name of the book
is "One Body Massage."

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.010
And I'm so glad to have my
friends Steve and Grace here

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.120
to talk about this.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.699
And thank you for all
that you do for the world.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.995
And my friends, please
welcome Grace and Steve.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.430
STEVE: Thank you.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.816
I won't bore you for long.

00:02:19.816 --> 00:02:21.190
But I just wanted
to let everyone

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.200
know, we did start the Wellstone
Center in the Redwoods,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.470
in Santa Cruz, my wife and
I. I'll leave some cards here

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.870
if anyone wants to
pick one up afterwards.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.860
But the exciting news
is now that Grace

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.380
has finished working on
her book, which is great,

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.980
I can't emphasize it enough--
her beautiful artwork, all

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.880
the heart and soul she put
into telling her story.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.040
It's not just a practical
guide to massage.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.530
It's really a book about
opening up a new mind

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.840
set, a new mentality.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.250
So I think, I'm sure
you'll enjoy it too.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.920
But at some point
soon, she'll also

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.170
be doing a weekend workshop
at the Wellstone Center.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.880
So it'll just be
for a few people.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.950
Probably four or six.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.800
And if you're
interested in that,

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.980
please let Grace know, or
I'll leave these cards,

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.960
someone can approach me.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.330
And that'll be it for me.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.320
So let's just put our
hands together for Grace.

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.985
Thank you.

00:03:09.985 --> 00:03:12.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.060
GRACE KU: Well, I have
a confession to make.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.770
I did not grow up
thinking I was going

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.010
to save the world, be a
writer, or a massage therapist.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.930
I dreamed of being
a ninja Superman

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.720
princess who gets to eat
candy and do art all day long.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.670
I wasn't calm, peaceful,
and oftentimes I

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.770
thought everything was about me.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.763
OK, second confession, I
still do that sometimes.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.910
Like most graduates from the
Academy of Art University,

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.910
I worked as a web
and graphic designer.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:58.142
So I'm very familiar
with this, and this.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:07.070
Oftentimes, I feel like this.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.820
Neck, back, shoulder,
and wrist tension

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.820
were part of my identity.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.798
That went on for six-plus years,
until one day I met a stranger.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.430
"I went on a business trip
with Ryan to Venice Beach.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:33.530
While he worked, I
sat under a palm tree,

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.770
sipping a glass of
lemonade, scribbling away

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.250
on the sketch pad,
watching a shop owner

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.950
making a deal with a tourist
on the tie-dyed t-shirt.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.400
A strange man with two little
white dogs approached me.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.020
The man asked if I could
watch his dogs while he

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.860
went to get them some water.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.380
Sure, why not.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.100
I'm on vacation.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.350
I gladly accepted
the responsibility

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.660
of watching two cuties.

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.140
When the strange man
returned with water,

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.000
he introduced himself and
proceeded to share his story.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.400
Larry was his name.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.740
He was in his late 50s and
worked as a clairvoyant energy

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.120
healer.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.830
A little strange, I
thought to myself.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.660
Larry began to have visions when
he was seven, seeing or sensing

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.570
things that were
not there, feeling

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.560
what was about to happen.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.070
He lived with his
single mother who asked

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:35.170
him to keep his gift a secret.

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:37.960
He honored her request
and went on living

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.410
like a normal person, until he
had a midlife crisis, at which

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.420
point he decided he
was old enough to know

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.710
what was best for himself.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.620
So he embraced his
ability to sense and work

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.900
with people's energy
to help them heal.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.190
He told me his story
and then offered

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.230
to check my energy balance.

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.580
The strange man is offering
to do energy work on me,

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.940
I thought.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.070
Should I let him?

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.160
I looked around.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.160
People were biking
and walking nearby.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.720
I figure, I was safe.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.690
If anything got weird, I
could always yell out, fire!

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.860
Plus, I was on vacation.

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.010
There was nowhere
I needed to be,

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.550
and nothing needed to be done.

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.300
OK, sounds good, I tell him.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.130
Larry asked me to sit
comfortably and look out

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.760
to the ocean.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.580
First he did some massage
to loosen up my shoulders,

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.330
focusing on specific
shoulder joints

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.620
with a combination of rubbing,
pulling, and rotating.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.440
Then he reminded me to breathe.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.260
I took some deep breaths
and felt a little bit

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.450
more comfortable, like I was
sitting more relaxed and taller

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.260
at the same time.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.340
I felt this heat coming out
of his hands on my lower back,

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.760
without him actually
touching my back.

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.410
I told him I was
five when I pretended

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.960
to be Superman,
red cape and all,

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.260
and riding my tricycle
as fast as I could.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.600
I took off on top
of the staircase.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.370
Next thing I knew I
was crying for mommy.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.140
Since then, I was always
having issues with my lower

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.980
back and my right shoulder.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.600
Larry was concentrating
on moving blocked energy,

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.770
as he called it,
from my lower back.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.350
I feel the heat flowing
from my lower back

00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.950
to the middle of
my back, and slowly

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.730
spreading out to my
shoulders and cooling off.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:49.840
It was a sense of
relief, like finally

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.760
letting go of a burden I had
been carrying for a long while.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.210
I sighed and felt like crying.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.910
It was so good to be free
of my emotional baggage.

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.880
That was the first
time I experienced

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.670
how emotion is intertwined with
the physical body, all thanks

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.330
to Larry, a complete stranger
who wanted nothing from me

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:14.260
but half an hour of
my time to heal me.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.830
Thank you, Larry,
wherever you are."

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.940
That experience taught
me that not everything

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:25.800
needed to be seen or
measured to be real.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.090
I feel fortunate to
have the opportunity

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.810
to explore this
touchy feely world

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.760
with the support of my
family, friends, and massage

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.440
instructors.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.260
Throughout my career
as a massage therapist,

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.520
I'm very blessed to have
so many amazing clients.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.120
Some of you are here today.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:44.690
Thank you.

00:08:49.099 --> 00:08:50.640
I feel like I'm just
going on and on.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.140
OK.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:57.940
I can feel like my heart
is pumping really fast.

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:00.380
And let me take
a deep breath in,

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:05.430
like I was reminding my clients
during massage sessions,

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:11.190
like breathing deeply into your
belly, and breathe out slowly.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.940
Feel like I'm drawing a blank.

00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:19.895
OK.

00:09:19.895 --> 00:09:22.760
Let us bring the spotlight
to our nervous system,

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.730
because I have, and
you have them too.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.820
So sympathetic
nervous system is also

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.040
known as fight, flight,
and freeze response.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.830
Here's the scenario.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.827
Starting your day with a cup
of coffee, checking your email,

00:09:39.827 --> 00:09:41.785
then realize your perf
review with your manager

00:09:41.785 --> 00:09:43.300
is this morning.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.960
Hurrying getting yourself
and the kids ready,

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.210
stuck in the typical
Silicon Valley traffic.

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.770
Someone cut you off, did not
let you into the car pool lane.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.700
Finally get the kids
into the daycare center,

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.970
then you realize
one baby desperately

00:09:57.970 --> 00:10:00.850
needed a diaper change.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.920
Back in your car,
sipping on your coffee,

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.220
and all of a sudden, the
traffic came to a complete stop.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.090
You hit the brake
just in time, also

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.380
spill that coffee on yourself.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:16.450
Now you're also late for
your important meeting.

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.840
The parasympathetic
nervous system

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.940
is responsible for rest
and digest function.

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.760
Here's another scenario.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:32.440
After a spontaneous yoga
and a nourishing meal,

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:35.570
you're lounging
comfortable in your pajama.

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:37.760
You have no appointments
today, so who

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.520
cares if your hair looks crazy?

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.550
The sun is warm, comfortable.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:48.240
There's a nice breeze
to keep you feel good.

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:54.320
And you are reading a wonderful
book, "One Body Massage,"

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.850
by Grace.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.900
Listening to your favorite music
in the back, you feel good.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.460
Life is good.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:06.630
When life is easy when smelling
roses, and not so much when

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.070
dealing with dirty diapers.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:10.210
Well, guess what?

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:11.135
Shit happens.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.910
The knee jerk reaction of
getting mad and looking

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.630
for who's to blame will
not solve the problem.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.150
Fight, flight, and
freeze reaction

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.730
are important for our survival.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.400
However, when it's
working overtime,

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.890
it's draining your mental,
emotional, and physical energy.

00:11:32.890 --> 00:11:35.050
Then we have a problem.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.220
No wonder today's top
selling prescription drugs

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:46.480
are Lipitor, a cholesterol
lowering drug, 7.2 billion.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.690
Side effects, kidney,
liver and heart failure.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:56.100
Nexium an anti acid
drug, 6.3 billion.

00:11:56.100 --> 00:12:00.970
Side affects, tightness in
chest and vomiting of blood.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.710
OK, I didn't make this up.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:08.600
Abilify, an anti-psychotic
drug, 4.6 billion.

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.220
Side effects, lose
control of muscles.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:17.840
What would it be
like if we populate

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.680
half of the commercial
time and advertising

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:25.084
space with something like this.

00:12:25.084 --> 00:12:29.100
This message is brought to you
by your parasympathetic nervous

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.760
system.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:31.260
Hello.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.300
Remember me?

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:37.200
Do you know that deep
and conscious breathing

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:41.150
is a natural painkiller
and stress reducer?

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.960
Go ask yourself and give
yourself the permission

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:48.630
to breathe deeply and
consciously any time

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.110
when you feel overwhelmed.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:55.450
And hey, by the way,
there are no side effects.

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:59.360
So should we get some
of that yummy goodness?

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.900
You might find it
helpful to have

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.180
your eyes closed for this part.

00:13:08.555 --> 00:13:12.120
"Feel the warm air
warming up in your nose

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.860
and traveling from your
nose, spreading out

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:17.410
to the branches of your lungs.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:21.840
The diaphragm rises, filling
every organ and blood

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:26.180
vessel with life
giving oxygen. Feel

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:33.700
the expansion of every cell
and sense, and slowly exhale.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.240
The body relaxes.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.110
Any tension that is stored in
the face, between the brows,

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:47.020
around the eyes, in the jaw
line, is starting to let go.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:52.170
The muscles in the front and
back of the neck lengthen,

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.990
creating more space for the
shoulders and the collar bones

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:58.470
to rest.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:01.600
The arms, elbows,
wrists, and fingers

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.540
lengthen as if there is an
invisible light source shooting

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:10.170
out from each fingertip.

00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:13.770
The sternum, shoulder
blades, front and back

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:18.960
of the rib cages and belly
muscles come closer together

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.350
and squeeze out any
remaining carbon dioxide

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:27.000
and massage the internal organs.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.960
The hips, knees, ankles, and
toes are free of movement.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.320
Cervical, thoracic,
lumbar, sacral,

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.820
about all of the 33 of
the spinal vertebrae

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:44.450
are filled with nourishing
cerebral spinal fluid that

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.970
travels from the
cranium to the tail bone

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.970
and back to the cranium.

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:55.660
The cranial sutures, joints,
tendons, ligaments, muscles,

00:14:55.660 --> 00:15:00.130
and blood vessels expand
and contract with the rhythm

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:02.520
of the universe.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:06.070
Inhalation and exhalation.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:08.550
Feel the sensation
of the clothes

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:12.500
you are wearing
touching your skin.

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:17.340
Feel the socks on your
feet and inside the shoes.

00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.860
What's the texture?

00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:26.400
Does the sensation change with
inhalation and exhalation?

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.050
If you are sitting, notice
which part of your butt

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:32.430
is touching the chair.

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:36.670
Is it toward the back where
you can feel your tail bone?

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:39.010
Is it toward the middle
where you are actually

00:15:39.010 --> 00:15:42.030
sitting on your sit bones?

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.260
Maybe it's more
toward the front,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.820
where you are hunching over.

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:50.530
Are you sucking in your gut?

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.030
Are you breathing fully?

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:57.380
Are your shoulders relaxed,
or are they raised?

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:00.820
Are they pulled toward your
chest, pulled way back,

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:04.850
or happily resting at your side?

00:16:04.850 --> 00:16:07.660
Is your neck extend forward?

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:11.890
Is it more comfortable to turn
to one side than the other?

00:16:11.890 --> 00:16:16.740
How are you feeling
in your body now?

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:21.250
Feel your feet
rooted on the ground,

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.810
and extend to the
center of the earth.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:29.660
Your arms gently
rest at your side.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.930
Breathe in and draw up the
earth energy from your feet

00:16:32.930 --> 00:16:36.890
to your legs and hips.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:40.420
The spinal discs are
stacking one by one

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:45.090
on top of each other,
with space and fluids

00:16:45.090 --> 00:16:48.720
for ease of movement.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.270
Your head is
resting effortlessly

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:54.560
on top of the cervical spine.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.360
It feels like there
is a string connected

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:02.670
to the top of your head,
pulling you toward the sky.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.510
Draw the heaven
energy to your crown,

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:09.910
which is charging
with positive energy.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:14.770
Breathe out and recycle all
the energy back into the earth

00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:15.644
through your feet.

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:23.599
Remember, the body
is three dimensional.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:28.910
Feel the relationship of your
body with your surroundings.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:32.500
Feel the air element that
is moving through you,

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.160
and wrapping around you.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:37.115
Feel the earth element
you are standing

00:17:37.115 --> 00:17:40.300
on that is holding you.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.760
Feel the water element
you are made of,

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.640
and that is flowing through you.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.730
Feel the fire element that
is living beneath the ground

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.210
and within your body.

00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:55.870
You are made of stardust.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:18:00.630
Every element that is in
the universe is within you."

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:02.675
You can gently open your eyes.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:11.170
Doctor Stephen R. Covey,
author of "7 Habits

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:13.330
of Highly Effective
People," says

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:17.870
that we are not human beings
on a spiritual journey.

00:18:17.870 --> 00:18:23.370
We are spiritual beings
on a human journey.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.835
[HUMMING]

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:40.470
I live in the Santa Cruz
mountains with my family,

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:44.470
and every Sunday my
daughter Eureka and I

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:48.520
will roll the trash can down
to highway nine Monday morning

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.990
pick up.

00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:54.750
And one Sunday, just
like any Sunday,

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:58.020
I pushed the can
down with one hand.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.810
And held her hand with another.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:02.660
And all of a sudden
she let go of my hand,

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:07.640
she ran in front of
me, and say, stop!

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.530
And then she carefully
kneeled down to the ground

00:19:10.530 --> 00:19:13.182
and put her hands together
in a prayer position,

00:19:13.182 --> 00:19:18.120
and she say Namaste
to the trees.

00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.490
She say, Mommy, do this.

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:22.240
Like, I feel really silly.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.120
In my head, I was
thinking about, OK.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.360
I should do the dishes, walk
the dog, clean the house,

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.610
and cook lunch.

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.180
I have no time for this, Eureka.

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.600
Then she's like, Mommy, do it.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.810
So I say, OK.

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:38.190
So I kneel down next to her
and looking at the trees.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:39.450
It's like, wow.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.530
You know, I passed by
these trees so many times,

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:43.250
but I never realized
how beautiful

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:47.620
they are, and the fresh
mountain air, also

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:53.470
the wild flowers that's around
us, and her, right next to me.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:58.510
At that point I feel so blessed,
and peaceful, and grateful.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:20:00.550
My three-year-old
taught me a great lesson

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:03.480
about being present.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.730
Well, let's face it.

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:06.694
It's really not
easy being present.

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:13.310
Therefore, there are
so many books out there

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.900
reminding us of it.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.790
Ming.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:20.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:23.610
Even right now, I'm
sharing my story with you.

00:20:23.610 --> 00:20:26.990
But part of my brain is
thinking about something else.

00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:39.610
There's another one.

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:41.430
Just all the
thoughts in my head.

00:20:44.294 --> 00:20:44.960
Thank you, Ming.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:53.630
When we are present, we
are one with ourselves.

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:56.700
And through that awareness,
we extend our touch

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.400
to another human being.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:03.240
During lunch with Ming
once, he said to me,

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.860
in the center of
our being is joy.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:11.350
I looked at him like, I'm
not so sure about that.

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.890
Just look at all the
miseries in the world.

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.010
How could it be?

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:20.480
During my own healing session
from the myofascial release

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:29.370
workshop, I went back in time
and visit my own suffering.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:31.910
I kicked, screamed,
cried, and one

00:21:31.910 --> 00:21:35.631
point I wanted to punch
and bite my therapist.

00:21:35.631 --> 00:21:37.047
Well, he gave me
a pillow instead.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:43.690
It was done in a safe and
supportive environment.

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:46.600
And throughout that, my
instructor, John Barnes,

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:50.550
reminded me that I survived.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:55.270
I am not what happened to me.

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:58.310
With simple breathing
exercise that

00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:03.380
help me to be in the present,
and when I'm present,

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.590
I am here.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.570
When I'm here, I
have the capacity

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:12.110
to be touch with my
true essence, which

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:15.940
is love and compassion
towards myself,

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.910
love, compassion
towards another.

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:22.870
And that is joy.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.733
Another story to share with you.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.590
"During one massage
session at Google,

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.440
I applied acupressure
for an engineer

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.520
who was going through
some life changes.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.600
His body was open
to receive the work,

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:44.520
and he felt calm and
peaceful afterward.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:48.010
However, he was having a hard
time wrapping his mind around

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:50.820
what had just happened.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:53.530
I think this is a more
engineer perspective,

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:58.180
because he suggested we
should conduct an experiment

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.080
to prove the
existence of energy,

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.160
and establish what
he felt was real.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.720
Why it never came to my
mind as a massage therapist?

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:12.200
We walked to Charleston Park
next to Google's main campus,

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:16.470
and from a plastic bag,
he pulled out an oven mitt

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:19.900
and a sheet of baking foil.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.660
I brought along a palm
sized clear crystal ball

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:24.810
and rose quartz.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:28.260
We sat facing each other
on the wooden bench

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:32.800
among well manicured blossoming
cherry trees and tall snake

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.380
grass, and then made
waterfall gurgle nearby.

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:41.180
With eyes closed we
rubbed our hands together

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:45.470
to create heat in our palms,
then gradually pulling

00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:49.350
our hands apart while
maintaining the unseen

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.250
connection.

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:55.590
The engineer opened his eyes
with a look of amazement.

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:59.720
The connection between our
palms was warm, sticky, round,

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.720
elastic, fluid, and infinite.

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.480
He then put the oven
mitt on his right hand,

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.440
and we went back
to concentrating

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.770
on the sensation in our hands.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:15.660
Was there any difference?

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:21.150
For those of you holding your
breath, the answer is no, nada.

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:25.440
The oven mitt did not disturb
the energy flow at all.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.540
Next up, the foil.

00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:31.120
My client fashioned
make-shift mittens

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:35.420
out of the foil for each of
his hands, and we tried again.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.610
While facing him and
seeing him with foil hands,

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:43.220
it was hard for me not
to burst out laughing.

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:47.010
The foil made energy feel
cooler, but that was it.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:49.840
OK.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:54.260
Now it was my turn to bring
out the crystal and quartz.

00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.820
I had them in my hands
during this final trial.

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.790
The concentration of energy
work heated up the rocks fast,

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:05.430
and the weight in my hands
made me feel more grounded.

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:09.600
But I was not able to
detect the quality change

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.250
within the energy itself.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:14.740
In this one hour
experiment, my client

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.110
concluded that
energy does exist,

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:21.060
and can be raised
when we concentrate

00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:25.570
and direct our attention,
in this case, to our hands.

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:29.930
For me it was great to witness
how energy follows intention,

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:33.300
and that anyone can
learn to cultivate it."

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:38.170
So now I would like you to stand
up and find a space so it's

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:41.770
big enough for you to open
up your arms without hitting

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:42.690
your neighbors.

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:45.120
Feel free to explore
back of the room.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.040
There might be more
space back there.

00:25:50.870 --> 00:25:53.060
All right.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.430
Now we're just going to bounce.

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:57.610
So we're going to start
bouncing from our ankles.

00:25:57.610 --> 00:25:58.750
And that's our focus.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:03.600
Just bounce from our ankles.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.990
Might feel silly at first.

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:06.310
It's OK, we all look silly.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:22.980
And then move the bouncing to
your knees, up to your hips.

00:26:30.604 --> 00:26:32.270
Travel all the way
up to your shoulders.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.420
This is fun.

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:47.120
And to your elbows,
your wrists, open up

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.596
the joints, your fingertips.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.836
Finally to your head.

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:00.160
I trust that you
know your limits,

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.165
and you know how to
keep yourself safe.

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.820
Feel free to make
faces if you like,

00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:13.638
if that feels natural to you.

00:27:16.266 --> 00:27:19.850
You are free to make sound
if that's authentic to you,

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:21.512
any expression that you have.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:34.570
And slowly make the movement
smaller, and smaller,

00:27:34.570 --> 00:27:42.805
and smaller yet, until finally
you come to a still point.

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:49.443
Now rub your hands together.

00:27:52.164 --> 00:27:55.510
Fast or slow, however
that works for you.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:58.745
Our goal here is to generate
heat between our hands.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:06.220
Now is a good time to focus
your attention and intention

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:07.184
between your palms.

00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:12.120
Remember to breathe.

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:16.880
Remember that's good for you.

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:33.342
Once you feel heat
generate in your palms,

00:28:33.342 --> 00:28:36.193
and you can cup your
hands with your hands.

00:28:44.743 --> 00:28:47.197
And feel the muscles
around your eyes.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:53.500
Can they be more relaxed?

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.540
Can they be softer?

00:28:58.090 --> 00:28:59.245
Where did everybody go?

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.910
And now, place one hand
on top of your head,

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:11.596
and the other over your heart.

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.836
Let's connect our
mind and our feelings.

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:27.340
Is there something that your
mind wants to tell your heart?

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:35.290
Is there anything
that your heart

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:37.068
wants to share with your mind?

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:49.320
With the mind and heart
awareness, scan your body

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.146
and find an achey area.

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:02.020
And now tighten that
achey area or around

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.120
it with your intention.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.540
We are going to hold
that for 12 seconds.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:41.990
And place one hand, or if you
can reach that area with two

00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:46.690
hands, you can sandwich that
area, over your achey area

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:48.065
wherever that might be.

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:56.190
We're going to breathe
deeply into that area,

00:30:56.190 --> 00:30:58.740
and breathe out completely.

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.560
Going to do that six times.

00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:30.850
Is this area asking for
nurture and cuddling,

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:34.560
or is this achey area asking
to be stretched and moved?

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:45.070
Now bring your hands in front
of your heart in a prayer

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.890
position.

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:49.990
Keep your thumbs
and your pinkies

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:54.550
touched, and open the rest over
your fingertips and your palm

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:56.481
like you're opening up a flower.

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:05.968
Now breathe in the love and
compassion for yourself.

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:16.010
Love and compassion
for those around you.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:34.660
Love, compassion for your family
and friends, and also those

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:36.072
who have hurt you before.

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:47.150
Slowly place one
hand on your stomach,

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.412
and another beneath
your belly button.

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:58.315
Feel the sensation of being
in touch with yourself.

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:12.070
Now place your hand
on top of your head,

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:15.820
and dance on your head.

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.550
Wake up your head.

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:19.540
Wake up your mind.

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:21.953
Like a spring mist.

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:28.410
And dance that
finger on your face.

00:33:28.410 --> 00:33:29.442
Wake up your face.

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:41.080
Place your hands
on your forehead.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:46.380
We are going to bring our hands
towards our temporal lobes,

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:50.060
as if though you are opening
up a window in your mind,

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:55.680
and let all the negativity
and worries out.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.160
So move slowly
from your forehead

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.370
to your temporal lobes.

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:06.096
When you reach there,
pause, take your time.

00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.710
Check in with your body.

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:27.020
Are your shoulders
raised close to your ear?

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:31.203
If you are, see if you can
have them slowly drop down.

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:39.929
When you're by your temporal
lobes, now make a circle,

00:34:39.929 --> 00:34:41.311
tiny circles there.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:52.322
And slowly enlarge the circle.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:05.250
From your temporal
lobes, you are

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:09.490
going to bring your fingers
down towards your chin.

00:35:09.490 --> 00:35:13.260
At the same time, you're going
to be opening your mouth.

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.110
You might remember this
during our massage session.

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:21.766
So slowly stretch down towards
your chin, and open your mouth.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:27.516
We carry so much
tension here in our jaw.

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:57.790
If you have your eyes closed,
you can gently open them up.

00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:03.940
Look around at people
in this room and smile,

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:05.190
like you have a secret.

00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:17.230
Excellent, Feel free to stay
where you are or come back

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:17.800
to your seat.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:19.660
Whatever that speaks to you.

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:28.038
Forgot to show this earlier.

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:33.950
The present of being in
the now, in the moment.

00:36:42.621 --> 00:36:45.010
And the heart and the
mind conversation.

00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:09.630
So remember this, energy
follows intention.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:12.090
Energy, when you
focus your attention

00:37:12.090 --> 00:37:16.860
and when you're in the
present, you create energy.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.162
I'd like to share a
little study with you.

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:30.630
"Massage is for all of us.

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:35.150
Everyone can benefit from
loving and caring touch.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:36.980
Remember the famous
research done

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:40.900
by psychologist Harry
Harlow in the 1960s

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:43.870
on the nature of affection?

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:47.770
He removed baby monkeys
from their biological mother

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:51.420
6 to 12 hours after
birth, and gave them

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:55.300
the choice of two monkey
mommy look alikes.

00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:59.700
The first mommy was made of
wire and had a baby bottle

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:02.380
attached to offer food.

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:07.180
The second mommy was
made of soft terrycloth,

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.240
but offered no food.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.440
Tough choice.

00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:15.570
The experiment showed that the
baby monkey spent more time

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:20.050
with the soft fake mommy with
no food than the wire mommy

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:21.930
with food.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:25.640
Seeking and offering
affection is innate.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:30.950
The poetry and magic in touch
begins with self-awareness,

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:33.400
centering, and presence.

00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:38.810
Because the real magic is
moving from the heart with love.

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:42.400
Our hands are extensions
of that same love.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.700
After all, nothing
has meaning unless we

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.910
put meaning behind it.

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:52.640
And if we do not know
what we mean, what we do,

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.360
why bother doing it
in the first place?"

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:59.074
That kind of sounds
like a fortune cookie.

00:38:59.074 --> 00:38:59.574
All right.

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:08.010
So here, this shows the
energy when we were bouncing

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:11.560
earlier that helped us unwind.

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:14.443
That was really good exercise
for you to do every day.

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:22.180
And this.

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:26.820
I love this quote
from John Lennon.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.730
"A dream you dream
alone is only a dream,

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:35.050
but the dream we dream
together is reality."

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:40.400
So I took a month off the
summer, went on vacation.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:45.090
I spent half of the time
at the beautiful Sedona.

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:49.550
That's why we weren't able
to find me [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:54.920
And the other half I went to
Iowa to visit grandpa Gus.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:58.730
Well, Gus grew up with his
abusive alcoholic father.

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:02.360
He left home when he was 15.

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:08.080
Gus joined the army and
fought in World War II.

00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.740
With only elementary
school education,

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:15.160
he managed to make a living
as a hard working farmer.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:18.730
He raised four children
with grandma Cole.

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:21.930
He is 95 today.

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:26.680
He has survived a knee,
back, and heart surgery.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:30.100
He's currently recovering
in a nursing home

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.410
two blocks away from
his house so grandma can

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:36.350
go visit him three times a day.

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:39.850
When I showed up, grandpa
seemed disoriented

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:42.430
due to all the drugs he was on.

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:44.600
He couldn't hear
very well either.

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:48.950
So we communicate
through smiling, nodding,

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:51.150
and frowning at times.

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:53.120
Well, I wanted to do
something to help him,

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:57.340
so I asked if I could
give him a massage.

00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.020
He nodded.

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:02.960
So I matched my breath
with his, I gently

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:09.390
placed my hand on his hand, and
wait for his body's permission.

00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:11.620
The change is very subtle.

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:16.200
It feels like the muscle tissue
was softer and more open.

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.380
It was significant.

00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:24.440
So I slowly opened up his palm,
and working between his digits,

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.080
and also along his digits.

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:31.560
He was smiling, so I
worked my way up his arms

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:35.490
and repeated the same
thing on the other side.

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:38.330
Well, this man has never
ever had a massage before,

00:41:38.330 --> 00:41:41.690
so he was looking
at his own hand.

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:43.510
And then he put his
hands like this.

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:47.570
He said, I'm ready
to go boxing now.

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:53.040
The next day I went back, I gave
him shoulder and back massage.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:56.340
And I said, hey, can
I work on your neck?

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:58.550
So I had him laying down.

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:03.440
I sat behind him, cradled
his head in my hands.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:07.840
I could feel his blood's
circulation, his breathing

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:10.930
cycle, and also
his cranium rhythm.

00:42:14.561 --> 00:42:15.061
Oh.

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:26.940
And I also felt his sadness,
confusion, and fear.

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:31.340
So without words I told
him that he is loved.

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:36.190
At that moment, grandpa
transformed into a little boy.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:41.660
We connected deeply and
meaningfully without words.

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:46.130
Right before I have
to go fly back home,

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:49.790
I went back to visit him again.

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:53.480
I was sad because I wasn't
sure if it was goodbye for now,

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.250
or goodbye forever.

00:42:56.250 --> 00:42:59.810
Grandpa touched my hand,
and look at me with clarity.

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:04.590
He said to me, I will be OK.

00:43:04.590 --> 00:43:10.180
"Love and compassion are
necessities, not luxuries.

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:13.810
Without them, humanity
cannot survive."

00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:16.180
Dalai Lama.

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:19.940
I'd like to close this
story with a mantra that

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:22.160
come to me during a
walk in the moonlight.

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:33.670
[SINGING] May the light shine
on you, the warm light of love.

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:39.120
May the light shine through you.

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:43.060
The bright light of joy.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:48.280
May the light be with you.

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:54.106
The pure light of peace
for you are the light.

00:43:56.990 --> 00:44:00.420
I'd like to give thanks
to Ming and Steve

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:04.940
for their contributions
to "One Body Massage."

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.770
To my massage instructors
and colleagues

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:12.060
contribute their knowledge,
Rock is here today.

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:13.610
Thank you, Rock.

00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:16.610
And special friends
that helped me to fund

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:18.380
this book in the beginning.

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:21.051
Also for your presence,
thank you so much.

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:32.931
I believe we have
some time for Q&amp;A.

00:44:32.931 --> 00:44:34.430
AUDIENCE: So, yeah,
my name is Gopi,

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:37.320
and I work with Grace in a
completely different capacity,

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:41.830
and always been struck
by how much you bring

00:44:41.830 --> 00:44:43.880
this aspect of everything
that he spoke about,

00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:46.900
and even things he learned
from the world of healing

00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:49.860
in massage therapy,
into your other work,

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:53.070
into the Google
work you do with me.

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:54.740
And so I wanted to
comment on that.

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.870
And then I had a
question, because I

00:44:56.870 --> 00:44:58.650
would like to embody that.

00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:01.870
And so the wisdom taken
from these traditions

00:45:01.870 --> 00:45:05.150
actually show up in
my business meetings,

00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:07.360
or in my product
development work.

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:09.180
How do you do that,
is the question.

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:11.040
Or what is the best way?

00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:13.060
GRACE KU: What's the best way?

00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.290
Well, I would just
use my own experience

00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:17.870
while I was working as the
web and graphic designer

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:20.440
constantly dealing
with deadlines.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:23.260
I think communication is
really a difficult thing,

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:26.260
because a lot of times
we have expectations.

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:30.810
So it's good to give
empathy to another person.

00:45:30.810 --> 00:45:33.910
Doesn't mean we have to
agree, but to take the time

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:36.530
and give the other person
a space, to really hear

00:45:36.530 --> 00:45:39.340
them and see what
are their needs,

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:42.590
even been with a client,
exactly what they want.

00:45:42.590 --> 00:45:44.610
What they want, is it
something possible?

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:46.570
Is it reasonable?

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:49.860
Is it something that
we can deliver and come

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:52.920
to a peaceful solution?

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.370
I think that would be a good
way to deal with business.

00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:57.810
Especially, I manage
Gopi's schedule.

00:45:57.810 --> 00:45:59.560
I know how busy he is.

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:00.855
And a lot of you guys are, too.

00:46:00.855 --> 00:46:04.770
Like constantly meetings,
and running here to there.

00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:09.620
Deadlines, projects, and
can be very, very stressful.

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:12.530
So I feel that if any
time when you feel

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:15.450
stressed, take a deep
breath in, and know

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:18.070
that everything is fine.

00:46:18.070 --> 00:46:19.180
Because everything is.

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:21.990
We are here, we
are enjoying life,

00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:25.860
we are being here itself
is a gift, to be who we are

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:27.660
and embrace that.

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:31.260
And I think when you walk
into a room with that people,

00:46:31.260 --> 00:46:35.710
that energy transform from
you to another person.

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:39.110
And I think we can
all smile more.

00:46:39.110 --> 00:46:42.690
When we smile, we create
these natural endorphins.

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:43.660
And people look at you.

00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:45.750
It's like, oh, she's
smiling, and she's happy.

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:48.890
I'm not afraid to come
talk to her or him.

00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:51.280
So I hope that
answered your question.

00:46:53.761 --> 00:46:54.260
Yes.

00:46:54.260 --> 00:46:55.260
AUDIENCE: Quick comment.

00:46:55.260 --> 00:46:57.660
So, yeah, like Ming, I've
known Grace for probably

00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:01.560
over eight years, back when I
was based in the Tokyo office.

00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:02.249
And I came out.

00:47:02.249 --> 00:47:04.040
I was with Google for
about two years then,

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:06.070
and I had never had
a Google massage.

00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:07.830
Or actually really any massage.

00:47:07.830 --> 00:47:10.970
And I think just kind by
accident, I found Grace.

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:11.790
I had a massage.

00:47:11.790 --> 00:47:15.434
And it was so amazing that I
also called her Amazing Grace

00:47:15.434 --> 00:47:16.210
behind her back.

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:19.460
And I always look forward to
coming back and seeing her.

00:47:19.460 --> 00:47:21.692
I remember I used to
email you and be like,

00:47:21.692 --> 00:47:23.150
Grace, I'm going
to be in town for,

00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:25.264
you know, in July, it's
like three months out.

00:47:25.264 --> 00:47:27.180
Any time, any chance I
can get an appointment?

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:28.960
And I don't know if that was
before [INAUDIBLE] existed

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.560
or if I just didn't
know how to use it.

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:32.351
But I used to always
email you and be like,

00:47:32.351 --> 00:47:33.930
try to get on your schedule.

00:47:33.930 --> 00:47:36.140
And now, again, too
I've, told all my friends

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:38.100
and now it's tough to
get an appointment.

00:47:38.100 --> 00:47:41.650
But I do want to, I
just want to thank you

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:44.750
for always being there
to sort of heal me,

00:47:44.750 --> 00:47:47.630
you know heal, for your
healing, both body and mind.

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:50.280
There are times Grace
knows I come and see her,

00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.080
and she says, how
are you doing today?

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:53.913
And I'm like, oh, my
shoulder is killing me.

00:47:53.913 --> 00:47:55.670
Oh, please just fix my shoulder.

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:57.490
Now it's hip, or
now it's my ankle.

00:47:57.490 --> 00:47:58.830
It's always something.

00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:03.840
And other times I walk in,
I just walk in, big exhale

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.762
and go, it's been a
tough couple of weeks.

00:48:06.762 --> 00:48:10.840
I just want to relax and fade
off into the Grace's world.

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:14.491
So thank you for always
providing that escape.

00:48:14.491 --> 00:48:16.782
GRACE KU: It's our world,
because we dream it together,

00:48:16.782 --> 00:48:17.274
remember?

00:48:17.274 --> 00:48:18.190
AUDIENCE: That's true.

00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:19.157
So thank you.

00:48:19.157 --> 00:48:19.990
GRACE KU: Thank you.

00:48:22.622 --> 00:48:24.330
AUDIENCE: So you've
put a lot of yourself

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:26.680
into this book with
the stories you

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:28.900
shared, and also
all your lessons.

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:31.245
And I'm wondering, in getting
in touch with yourself

00:48:31.245 --> 00:48:36.290
while writing this book, which
you did every day, while you're

00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:40.630
riding the bus over to
get from Santa Cruz.

00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:42.820
What did you learn along
that way on that journey

00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:44.140
of writing that book?

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:45.450
GRACE KU: Hm.

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:48.320
I learned that
it's so much harder

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:51.050
to put feeling into words.

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:53.480
Because when I'm in the massage
room, I'm with a client,

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:56.020
it was very intuitive
for me every time.

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:58.700
I don't think about, I
don't have a session plan,

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:01.960
because I feel
session plan is-- it

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.040
doesn't work for a real person.

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.390
Every time you come to see
me you're a different person.

00:49:06.390 --> 00:49:07.780
You feel differently.

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:11.580
So when someone come to
me, I just do what I do.

00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:15.180
I let my hands do what they do.

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:18.210
So put that into words was
really challenging for me,

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:19.450
for sure.

00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:21.920
Something I just do it,
have to put into words?

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.550
Like oh, OK, let's
break this down.

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:26.865
How do I do this and that?

00:49:26.865 --> 00:49:27.740
That was challenging.

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:30.190
And sometimes I'm on the bus,
I can write a whole chapter.

00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:33.880
And sometimes I sit there for
an hour, I only wrote two words.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.210
So it fluctuates.

00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:38.390
And I take my own
advice on the bus.

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:41.780
Not this, the sit up,
sit on my sit bones,

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:45.150
and breathe any time I
feel like I'm freaking out.

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:46.400
I go, OK, just breathe.

00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:49.760
When Steve emailed me, say
OK, we need this chapter

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:52.870
by the end of this week.

00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:57.360
There are four things I
do with my three-year-old.

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.710
We say this.

00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:07.190
We say, breathe, slow down,
don't freak out, and Namaste.

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:09.740
Those are the four mantras
I do with her every day

00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:11.450
when I take her to daycare.

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:15.660
So that's also a reminder for
myself, when I do freak out,

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.051
or when I'm not breathing.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.240
AUDIENCE: Was there anything
you learned about yourself

00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:26.030
from the introspection
along the way as well?

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:28.430
GRACE KU: Oh, I learned a lot.

00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:30.100
AUDIENCE: That you're
willing to share?

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:31.600
GRACE KU: I learned
that oftentimes,

00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:34.930
when we give people advice, it's
something that we need mostly.

00:50:34.930 --> 00:50:38.350
It seems like it's the
universe's way to remind us.

00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:40.580
OK, I feel universe's
way to remind

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:43.770
me to not take
everything personally,

00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:45.730
because I tend to do that.

00:50:45.730 --> 00:50:47.810
Or to please everyone.

00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:48.530
All right.

00:50:48.530 --> 00:50:50.330
So be true to yourself.

00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:53.190
I think that's most important.

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:57.750
And you attract the right
people into your life,

00:50:57.750 --> 00:51:00.490
and the right kind
of work, and people

00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:04.300
who naturally resonate with
your work will come to you.

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:07.270
I don't need to pretend to
be somebody else I'm not.

00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:10.114
So that's what I
learned, mostly.

00:51:10.114 --> 00:51:12.030
AUDIENCE: I just have a
little question, which

00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:13.820
I don't know if you
have an answer to,

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:16.460
but I'm wondering about
Larry, on the beach in Venice.

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:17.210
GRACE KU: Oh, yes.

00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:19.590
AUDIENCE: Was there
ever any other-- did you

00:51:19.590 --> 00:51:20.590
hear anything about him?

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:21.580
Did you ever seen him again?

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:22.160
GRACE KU: No.

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:23.147
AUDIENCE: Have you thought
bringing the book down

00:51:23.147 --> 00:51:24.390
and trying to find him?

00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.931
GRACE KU: No.

00:51:24.931 --> 00:51:27.160
I think maybe he
might be a ghost.

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:30.550
Or spirit from the future
that travels through time

00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:35.800
and come to me, say, Grace,
I have a lesson for you.

00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:39.000
So no, I don't know
anything about this guy.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:43.192
Just a nice person,
wanted to help me.

00:51:43.192 --> 00:51:45.150
AUDIENCE: With his dogs
on the beach in Venice.

00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:45.775
GRACE KU: Yeah.

00:51:45.775 --> 00:51:48.630
So if you go to Venice Beach,
remember to look out for Larry

00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:50.260
with two dogs.

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:51.821
You might get a free
massage session.

00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:58.820
Well, thank you so much for
spending the time with me

00:51:58.820 --> 00:51:59.610
this afternoon.

00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:01.760
I appreciate it.

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.370
MING: The book is
"One Body Massage,"

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:04.661
available where books are sold.

00:52:04.661 --> 00:52:07.190
And my friends, our
very own Grace Ku.

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.790
Thank you.

00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:08.623
GRACE KU: Thank you.

00:52:08.623 --> 00:52:11.904
