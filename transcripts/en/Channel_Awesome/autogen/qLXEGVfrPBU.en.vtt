the fact that this show does spend just

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770
the fact that this show does spend just
 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.760
the fact that this show does spend just
as much time developing just as unique

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770
as much time developing just as unique
 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.750

off you're just about the camera when

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639
off you're just about the camera when
 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.600
off you're just about the camera when
the Dragons come out um I said before

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610
the Dragons come out um I said before
 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.850
the Dragons come out um I said before

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860
you know shaky-cam a lot of times it's
 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.180
you know shaky-cam a lot of times it's
overused and silly but actually a lot a

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190
overused and silly but actually a lot a
 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.250
overused and silly but actually a lot a
lot of times can be very effective like

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260
lot of times can be very effective like
 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.580
lot of times can be very effective like
here where the Dragons come out and the

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:31.590
here where the Dragons come out and the
 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:33.830
here where the Dragons come out and the
camera is slightly shaking out asking

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840
camera is slightly shaking out asking
 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.559
camera is slightly shaking out asking
myself why does this

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:35.569
myself why does this
 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:38.139
myself why does this
work here and not in other moments

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:38.149
work here and not in other moments
 

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:40.169
work here and not in other moments
because there's lots of times I've seen

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:40.179
because there's lots of times I've seen
 

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:42.969
because there's lots of times I've seen
just people standing around and the

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:42.979
just people standing around and the
 

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:44.709
just people standing around and the
camera is moving you know sort of that

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:44.719
camera is moving you know sort of that
 

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:46.869
camera is moving you know sort of that
animation moving where you know the

00:06:46.869 --> 00:06:46.879
animation moving where you know the
 

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:48.939
animation moving where you know the
camera can't really be moving its effect

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:48.949
camera can't really be moving its effect
 

00:06:48.949 --> 00:06:51.850
camera can't really be moving its effect
they put it later and sometimes it can

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:51.860
they put it later and sometimes it can
 

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.109
they put it later and sometimes it can
be so distracting other times it can

00:06:53.109 --> 00:06:53.119
be so distracting other times it can
 

00:06:53.119 --> 00:06:54.519
be so distracting other times it can
really work and I felt really worked

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:54.529
really work and I felt really worked
 

00:06:54.529 --> 00:06:56.139
really work and I felt really worked
here when those dragons came out you

00:06:56.139 --> 00:06:56.149
here when those dragons came out you
 

00:06:56.149 --> 00:06:58.449
here when those dragons came out you
felt the size and the weight of these

00:06:58.449 --> 00:06:58.459
felt the size and the weight of these
 

00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:00.969
felt the size and the weight of these
dragons I realized why it's because what

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:00.979
dragons I realized why it's because what
 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:02.260
dragons I realized why it's because what
they're doing is that they're circling

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:02.270
they're doing is that they're circling
 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.529
they're doing is that they're circling
around and so what it feels like it's

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:05.539
around and so what it feels like it's
 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:08.709
around and so what it feels like it's
doing is that the wind and the weight

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:08.719
doing is that the wind and the weight
 

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:10.600
doing is that the wind and the weight
and the strength of them circling around

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:10.610
and the strength of them circling around
 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.049
and the strength of them circling around
is shaking the camera so there it's

00:07:14.049 --> 00:07:14.059
is shaking the camera so there it's
 

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:16.209
is shaking the camera so there it's
really justified it isn't just shaking

00:07:16.209 --> 00:07:16.219
really justified it isn't just shaking
 

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:18.189
really justified it isn't just shaking
for no reason it makes you actually feel

00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199
for no reason it makes you actually feel
 

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:19.929
for no reason it makes you actually feel
the size of these things

00:07:19.929 --> 00:07:19.939
the size of these things
 

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:23.170
the size of these things
and it's such a subtle little touch but

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.180
and it's such a subtle little touch but
 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.379
and it's such a subtle little touch but
I imagine that scene if you took out the

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:26.389
I imagine that scene if you took out the
 

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:28.509
I imagine that scene if you took out the
little shaking of it I mean it'd still

00:07:28.509 --> 00:07:28.519
little shaking of it I mean it'd still
 

00:07:28.519 --> 00:07:29.829
little shaking of it I mean it'd still
be good but it wouldn't be nearly as

00:07:29.829 --> 00:07:29.839
be good but it wouldn't be nearly as
 

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:33.369
be good but it wouldn't be nearly as
impressive just that little shaking when

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:33.379
impressive just that little shaking when
 

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:36.639
impressive just that little shaking when
the dragons are circling around worked

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:36.649
the dragons are circling around worked
 

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:38.469
the dragons are circling around worked
out really really well and that sound

00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479
out really really well and that sound
 

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:40.540
out really really well and that sound
does I do with the drive room although

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.550
does I do with the drive room although
 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.579
does I do with the drive room although
those sounds going at me that that was

00:07:42.579 --> 00:07:42.589
those sounds going at me that that was
 

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:43.179
those sounds going at me that that was
really great
