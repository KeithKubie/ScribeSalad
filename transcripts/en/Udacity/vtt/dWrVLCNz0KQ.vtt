So let's continue with our practice of the
Distributive Property. Can you tell me

00:00:05.963 --> 00:00:11.681
what -5y(y+z) is equal to? Remember to
simplify within each term as much as you

00:00:11.693 --> 00:00:17.297
can. And also remember if you need to
write an exponent, let's say you need to

00:00:17.309 --> 00:00:22.055
write 2^3, you would type that in as 2^3.
So, write the carrot sign before any

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:24.121
exponent that you need to type.
