00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.340
How the Phrase Red Herring Came to Mean Something
That is Misleading

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.809
Meaning a distraction or false trail, the
expression “red herring” has been relatively

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.779
commonly used for the last two centuries,
and its origins do, in fact, begin with a

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:22.160
rust-colored fish.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.829
However, until quite recently, the accepted
origins of red herring were themselves a false

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:28.829
trail.

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:35.390
The literal sense of a red herring dates to
at least 1250 AD when Walter of Bibbesworth

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.519
wrote in The Treatise, “He etep no ffyssh
But Heryng red.”

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.750
A product of the process used to preserve
the fish into a kipper, the herring is cured

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.629
in salt brine and then smoked for up to 10
days.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.800
If enough brine is used, the fish turns a
red, coppery color with a rather strong smell.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.989
Capable of being stored for long periods of
time, this dried kipper was inedible until

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.350
after it was first soaked in water to remove
the salt, and then it could be warmed and

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.350
eaten.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.460
A staple in English society, particularly
among the poor, there would have been a fair

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.340
amount of tough, dried red herring hanging
about.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.300
And, given that they had a strong smell, it
makes sense that their aroma would attract

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.300
animals.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.960
Accordingly, in 1697, Nicholas Cox described
just such a use in The Gentleman’s Recreation,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.330
where a red herring was supposedly dragged
along a route to get a young puppy to learn

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.340
to follow a trail.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.500
Others expounded upon Cox’s idea and said
that later in the training, while following

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.210
a fox or badger, a red herring would be dragged
perpendicular across the animal’s path to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.080
confuse the dog at first, but ultimately lead
to a dog that could stick to an original scent

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.830
as opposed to a compelling, intervening scent.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.780
This explanation was, for many years, accepted
as the origin of using red herring to mean

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.870
a false trail.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.850
But, as previously noted, this explanation
is actually a red herring as Cox’s initial

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.960
description was based on mistranslation of
a book on horse training by Gerland Langbaine

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.360
(also published in 1697).

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.790
In the book, Langbaine recommended using a
dead cat or fox for dogs to track and horses

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.250
to in turn be trained to follow, with the
red herring used to draw the dogs if cat or

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.000
fox was not available.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.489
In this case, there was no deception happening,
as would later be stated to support the notion

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.640
that this is where the expression came from,
and it wasn’t the dogs being trained, as

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.099
Cox would himself state.

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.709
This red herring was only revealed recently,
in a pair of articles published in Comments

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.569
on Etymology in 2008, along with what is now
accepted as the actual origin of our use of

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:30.879
the phrase red herring.

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.340
In the early part of the 19th century, journalist
and rabble-rouser William Cobbett used his

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.430
publication Weekly Political Register to decry
the English political establishment.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.180
In one story written on February 14, 1807,
while illustrating the gullibility of his

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.060
fellow members of the press, Cobbett described
the following use of a red herring, ostensibly

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.920
from his childhood, though thought to be a
fictional account:

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.270
When I was a boy, we used, in order to draw
oft’ the harriers from the trail of a hare

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.200
that we had set down as our own private property,
get to her haunt early in the morning, and

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.139
drag a red-herring, tied to a string, four
or five miles over hedges and ditches, across

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:11.939
fields and through coppices, till we got to
a point, whence we were pretty sure the hunters

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:16.980
would not return to the spot where they had
thrown off; and, though I would, by no means,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.439
be understood, as comparing the editors and
proprietors of the London daily press to animals

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:26.450
half so sagacious and so faithful as hounds,
I cannot help thinking, that, in the case

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.680
to which we are referring, they must have
been misled, at first, by some political deceiver.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.090
However, while Cobbett seems to have popularized
the figurative sense of a red herring being

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.219
a false trail, and this indeed is the accepted
origin according to the Oxford English Dictionary,

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:45.120
he does not actually appear to be the originator
of the idea.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.849
There is one known earlier reference to this
figurative sense, which at least my edition

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.950
of the OED seems to ignore.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:57.909
This was spoken during a Parliamentary session
on March 20, 1782, later published in the

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:00.989
1786 Beauties of the British Senate,

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.859
Though I have not the honour of being one
of those sagacious country gentlemen, who

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:10.150
have so long vociferated for the American
war, who have so long run on the red-herring

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.200
scent of American taxation before they found
out there was no game on foot; they who, like

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.250
their prototype, Don Quixote, have mistaken
the barber’s basin for a golden helmet…

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.810
Despite this early instance, the expression
didn’t ultimately became part of common

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:44.150
vernacular until after Cobbett reprinted an
“extended repetition 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.919
of it in 1833,
