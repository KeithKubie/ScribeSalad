00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:08.180
It does not lie within any of our remits to
be entirely sane. There are so many powerful

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:15.400
reasons why we must lack an entirely even
keel. We have complex histories, we are heading

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.980
towards the ultimate catastrophe, we are vulnerable
to devastating losses; love will never go

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.750
wholly well, the gap between our hopes and
our realities will be cavernous. In the circumstances,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.170
what we should aim for is not sanity, but
a wise, knowledgeable and self-possessed relationship

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:47.019
to our manifold insanities, or what we might
term ‘sane insanity.’ The sane insane

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:54.039
differ from the simply insane by virtue of
the honest and accurate grasp they have on

00:00:54.039 --> 00:01:00.199
what is not entirely right with them. They
may not be wholly balanced, but they don’t

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:06.579
have the additional folly of insisting on
their normalcy. They can admit with good grace

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:13.150
– and no particular loss of dignity – that
of course they are rather peculiar at a myriad

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.500
of points. They do not go out of their way
to hide from us what they get up to in the

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.040
night, in their sad moments, when anxiety
strikes, or during attacks of envy. They can

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.700
– at their best – be dryly funny about
the tragedy of being human. They lay bare

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.939
the fears, doubts, longings, desires and habits
that don’t belong to the story we like to

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.859
tell ourselves about sanity. They don’t
make ready confessions to let themselves off

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:51.140
the hook or to be eccentric. They simply realise
the unreasonableness of expecting to be reasonable

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.329
all the time. They warn others as far as possible
in advance of what being around them might

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:04.289
involve – and apologise promptly for their
failings as soon as they have manifested themselves.

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:09.899
They offer their friends and companions accurate
maps to their craziness, which is about the

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:16.530
most generous thing one can to anyone who
has to endure us. The sane-insane among us

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.599
are not a special category of the mentally
unwell: they represent the most evolved possibility

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:33.480
for a mature human being.Thank you for watching.
