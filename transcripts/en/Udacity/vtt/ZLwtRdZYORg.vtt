00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:05.769
My name is Joshua Lessing and I'm

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:08.914
the director of research and development at Soft Robotics.

00:00:08.914 --> 00:00:12.875
So I have a rather unconventional start in robotics.

00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:17.050
I'm actually a chemist by training and I came into robotics when I

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.635
started my post-doctoral work with Professor George Whitesides at Harvard University.

00:00:21.635 --> 00:00:26.320
And George Whitesides, he is one of the world's most famous chemists.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.109
And he not only does work in chemistry,

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.740
he really just does work in anything that he finds interesting.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.385
He's very very innovative.

00:00:34.384 --> 00:00:36.684
And so when I was in his lab,

00:00:36.685 --> 00:00:39.280
he was doing robotics.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.689
He was doing composites,

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:44.979
molecular, electronics, water-protein interactions.

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:46.264
The origins of life even.

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:48.984
Anything that he finds interesting, he works on.

00:00:48.984 --> 00:00:52.704
And he builds these cross-functional teams that

00:00:52.704 --> 00:00:57.159
are designed to come up with new ways of thinking about age old problems.

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:58.869
So in the case of Soft Robotics,

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:04.420
he had people who were chemists like myself, chemical engineers,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.859
people who understood bio-mechanics,

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:12.260
you name it, most of which were not conventional roboticists.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.925
Try to think about what would be a new way of building a robot.

00:01:15.924 --> 00:01:20.769
And where we got to was you know if you build robots

00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:25.599
out of rubbers and plastics and other kind of squishy materials,

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:28.059
liquids, you get robots that

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.980
astoundingly have all these new properties that are very very interesting.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.280
So that was some of the stuff that I worked on in his in his lab.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.210
And when it came time to commercialize the technology,

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:44.524
I left to start that here with Soft Robotics.

00:01:44.525 --> 00:01:48.295
I've spent my career trying to do bio-inspired research.

00:01:48.295 --> 00:01:52.570
So, early in my career it was trying to develop

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:55.119
biomimetic catalysts so that

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.700
the oil and gas industry could turn methane into ways of making nylon.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.159
Later on in my career it was trying to study

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:07.000
the fundamental molecular properties behind elastin,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.180
which is the the rubber that makes up

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.444
the soft robots that are people and animals and it's a remarkable material.

00:02:14.444 --> 00:02:17.349
So nature made the best rubber,

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:18.689
how do we replicate it?

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:22.704
And so moving here to the work at Soft Robotics,

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:28.440
you know, nature has made the best gripper ever conceived.

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.289
You know what can we learn about these biological systems and

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:36.739
how can we incorporate their design principles in the things that we make.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.115
Just because, you know, they're remarkable.

00:02:39.115 --> 00:02:45.335
There isn't an incredible amount of computation that goes into the use of your hand,

00:02:45.335 --> 00:02:47.895
not the kinds of computation that that

00:02:47.895 --> 00:02:51.505
most roboticists are accustomed to in the systems they built.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:55.419
But yet, miraculously, you can do far more with

00:02:55.419 --> 00:03:00.089
this than you could with a normal robotic gripper.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.439
And part of that is embedded in the mechanical design, you know,

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.615
the muscles, and tendons, and the bones,

00:03:07.615 --> 00:03:09.865
all the stuff that's in compression,

00:03:09.865 --> 00:03:11.865
all the stuff that's in tension.

00:03:11.865 --> 00:03:13.965
That whole mechanical structure,

00:03:13.965 --> 00:03:17.800
a lot of the smarts are just built into how it innately

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.270
responds to the environment even without active controls of moving your muscles.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.350
So what's exciting for me is having this possibility of delivering

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.519
this astonishing capability of getting ever closer to

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.000
this style of grasping through the technology that we work here to build everyday.
