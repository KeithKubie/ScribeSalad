00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.770
- I'm here in one of the most
special places on the planet

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:10.470
because there's a natural phenomenon

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.960
that occurs here and nowhere else.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.650
I'm Phil Torres, Atlas Obscura tour guide,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.990
researcher, and science communicator.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.630
And today, I'm leading a group through

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.960
the butterfly sanctuaries
in MichoacÃ¡n, Mexico.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.580
This is where tens of millions
of monarch butterflies

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.692
migrate every year to spend the winter.

00:00:28.692 --> 00:00:31.080
And the history behind
the scientific discoveries

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.230
and the significance to the local culture

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.730
are just as fascinating as
the butterflies themselves.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.010
- The way the story of the
discovery of these places

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.600
gets told is that it was in the mid-1970s

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.190
when people finally figured out where

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.260
the monarch butterflies went every winter.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.840
That story is

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.400
not untrue, but it ignores
the part where all the people

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.590
who lived in these places were aware

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.590
that monarch butterflies showed
up every year in the winter.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.680
- This is incredible.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.701
The trees are just orange,
they're like carpeting.

00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:07.633
Look back there, it's amazing!

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:11.755
Wow!

00:02:11.755 --> 00:02:13.750
That's me, Joe Hanson, biologist,

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.670
science communicator, and YouTuber.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.360
I've been fascinated by the story of

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.410
the monarch butterfly and
their epic journey for years.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.030
So I jumped at the
opportunity to go explore

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.130
their overwintering home
in Mexico along with

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.390
Atlas Obscura to learn more about

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.730
this epic bit of nature,
and its discovery.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.360
Now I'm gonna talk more
about how they accomplish

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.640
this epic feat over on my
channel, It's Okay To Be Smart.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.380
In the early 20th century,
scientists in North America

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.140
and Canada were wondering:
Where do the butterflies go

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.140
when they flew south for the winter?

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.420
In 1937, a Canadian zoologist
named Fred Urquhart,

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.650
along with his wife, Norah, began a quest

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.940
to answer that question.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.230
In the 1940s, the Urquharts
had devised an ingenious

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.050
way to tag monarch butterflies,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.800
and thousands of volunteers
across North America

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.370
tagged these butterflies and
reported their sightings.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.870
But every year, the
migration trail vanished

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.393
at the Texas-Mexico border.

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.140
In 1973, Fred Urquhart
put an ad in a Mexico City

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.220
newspaper looking for research assistants,

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.700
and two people answered:

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.490
an American named Ken
Brugger and his girlfriend

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.640
and later wife, a young Mexican
woman named Catalina Aguado.

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.190
For the next two years,
Catalina and Ken traveled

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.840
the Mexican countryside,
interviewing the locals

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.450
and counting the
butterflies along the road.

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.740
They immediately sent word
back to the Urquharts,

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.720
and the following year, in
1976, Fred Urquhart himself

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.050
made the walk up the
mountain to "discover"

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.873
the monarch overwintering forest.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.960
The credit for the
discovery of the monarch

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.740
overwintering habitat traditionally goes

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.120
to the Urquharts, and that makes sense.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.190
They did so much work
to track and to study

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.780
this migration across North America.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.130
But Catalina is only
mentioned in one line of

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.080
the story, "a bright and
delightful Mexican, 'Cathy,'"

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.090
and today, as we know,
uncredited on the cover,

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.880
the young woman dressed in butterflies.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.570
But this place was, and is,

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.653
special to more than just scientists.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.830
- So each of the sanctuaries
is managed by something

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.440
called an "ejido," which
is a uniquely Mexican form

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.960
of land tenure that dates back
to the Mexican Revolution.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.510
The idea is that the government grants

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.903
to these communities the
right to manage their lands,

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.060
and the right to create economic

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.440
opportunities off of their lands.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.600
Each community that
manages these sanctuaries

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.270
gets the revenue from the ticket sales,

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.680
from renting the horses that you take

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.990
to get up onto the mountain,

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.840
from selling you food,

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.750
and selling you gifts at the gift shop.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.260
And then as a community, each
of the members of the ejido

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.940
collectively determine
how to spend that money

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.310
for the benefit of the community.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:35.070
It's one of the most successful models for

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.420
community-based conservation
that we have in the world.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.520
The local guides that you interact with,

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.740
the ones that take you
up onto the mountain,

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.960
this is their home,
this is their backyard.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.160
This is where their families have lived,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.500
sometimes for generations,
and so you're not just

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.400
helping to protect this
charismatic species,

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.960
but you're also giving these communities

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.370
an incentive to continue
protecting their home.

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.190
You're giving them a reason
to continue acting as stewards

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.523
over this place.
