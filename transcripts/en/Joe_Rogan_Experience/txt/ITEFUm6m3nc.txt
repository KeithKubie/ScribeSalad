Speaker 1:          00:00:04       Hello Freak bitches. That's right. We're back. Oh, oh. I'm mixing it up. Prompts a dom Irrera whenever you say Ooh. Ah, Ooh. You got to give props to the Godfather. I'm, this episode is brought to you by [inaudible] Dot Com uh, on it is, if you've never heard it before about it before a human performance website. It's all supplements and strength and conditioning equipment dedicated to human performance, including the new primal bells, the new kettlebells that come in the form of gorillas and chimpanzees. These are just the beginning. We have a bunch of different designs coming out. The new gorilla one just came out and it's fucking Badass. It's 72 pounds. It's a a bad ass workout. It's got a big fat handle on it. And if you've never worked out with kettlebells and you buy something like this, let it be a goal. Don't have it be your main piece of exercise equipment.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       Because if you have never lifted kettlebells before and you don't understand it, 70 pounds is a lot of weight to swing around. So, uh, start with, I would start with light and do it correctly. And if you can, if you can afford to get a trainer or get someone who knows how to do it, to show you the movements, just film it on your phone and then watch it. You don't want to hurt yourself. And so if you're doing anything that is involving a strength and conditioning, my main, the main piece of advice that I always give people is learn what you're doing. Do it correctly, learn from someone and then pay attention to your form. It's the most important thing. If you get sloppy, that's when people get hurt and you don't want to get hurt when you swing it around a 72 pound kettle bell bitch.

Speaker 1:          00:01:38       All right. Especially one that looks like a gorilla, you'll feel so weakened, fleshy already. Um, we have all kinds of shit, battle ropes, maces and club bells, and there's a fantastic series of strength and conditioning DVDs, especially the ones that I can recommend. The extreme kettle kettle, excuse me, extreme extreme. Do I know how to talk? Extreme kettlebell cardio workout, DVD one and two, they're these fucking incredible workouts by this maniac named Keith Weber's guy's a nut. He's on the beach doing this workout that literally makes you want to just stop breathing. It's incredible. And you can, it'll kick your ass with a 45 pounder or 35 pound or even a, he uses a 45 pounder though in the video. Fantastic shit. Go to [inaudible] dot com any of the supplements, if you use the code named Brogan, you save 10% off any of the groovy shit.

Speaker 1:          00:02:29       All right, any of the supplements broken. Use the code. We're also brought to you by death squad.tv.

It's, but I hardly believe people when they say kicking Butt Sam kicking ass. I'll take you seriously. Say kicking butt and like, who are you? What are you doing? Partying was all ladies and beating them at things. How are you kicking? But just having them just staying busy. It's my favorite thing to do is to stay busy. What about kicking butt? Uh, well, you know what, I, I'm going to rephrase it. I've been kicking ass. There you go. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I appreciate, appreciate it. Also,

Speaker 1:          00:05:36       all the people that, uh, have, uh, sent comments pro and negative about a, the new Scifi TV show appreciate all your input. I think this is a rare time where people get to, uh, give input about things they see online, whether it's a standup comedy show or a, um, a TV show like this show or anything. It's important that people get to talk about stuff and telling, tell me what sucks. I want to know, you know, and it's, it's not perfect. There's no, no, none. No shows are perfect, man. It's hard. It's hard to do a television show that's perfect. It's also hard to do a terrible television show like this where you squeezing hours of information and hours of conversations until like 40 plus minutes. But one of the things that I've found is that people are so fucking attached to this shit. They believe they're so attached.

Speaker 1:          00:06:22       And one the big one that people are mad at me now is chem trails because a, we had an episode of that kind of debunk chem trails and it didn't debunk all chem trails. This is what people need to understand it, and this is a really important, first of all, I don't work for the government, but if I did work for the government, I probably wouldn't tell you, but I don't. I don't. I'm the fucking, I give up, come on pot smoking fucking cage fighting commentator. I'm not working for the government. All right, stop it. Don't be silly. You would be the perfect person. She'll what? What people are seeing for the most part when you see these con trails, these trails behind jet that become artificial clouds. The way it's been explained to me by not just one but numerous scientists is that when jet engines pass through various levels of condensation, it creates different effects.

Speaker 1:          00:07:12       And if a jet engine passes through sky that has enough condensation, it will literally change the temperature of the sky, stir it up and create a cloud and it's a lingering cloud behind the jet and if you're looking at it, it looks like someone's spraying artificial clouds and you get this feeling like, oh my God, they're spraying clap like I when I, I've saw them and I saw some of the documentaries on and there was a quite a bit of time before I was, I was looking at it, I was like, that doesn't make sense, but is it possible that they're really spraying artificial clouds out of all these planes? And then you talk to people to tell you that these are military planes and this is a constant geothermal engineering exercise. But then when you find out that it is possible to put a jet engine through various levels of condensation and create these clubs like scientifically proven hundred percent you got to go, okay, well that's 100% if that's 100% is there a way to tell when they're going to leave contrary and when they're not, it turns out the risk.

Speaker 1:          00:08:11       There's a NASA website and you go to the NASA website, it shows you where there's condensation, where there'll be contracts and it's for pilots so they could see better. It's for people that are like trying to observe the sky. It's like a bunch of reasons why they monitor this shit. They know when contracts are going to exist and when they're not. In fact, in 1942, the government was trying to figure out what the fuck was going on cause they just like first started having planes involved in world war two and they were um, they put out a paper on what they called persistent condensation trails and that is these lines that were behind these, these planes. And their conclusion was that it's a natural part of what happens to the atmosphere when a plane flies by and it's sometimes they last and sometimes they don't based on how much moisture is in the atmosphere.

Speaker 1:          00:08:51       19 fucking 42 they did this, so this is something that has been scientifically able to be explained for a long time. That set, now this is where everybody gets crazy. The I'm sure the government or let's just say people that are evil, let's not just say the government because they're probably not even the government now is probably the government of the past, which you can't blame the people now. You can blame them on a lot of shit. You can't blame him for shit that happened in the 50s for sure. People have sprayed things out of planes. Hundred percent yeah, it's definitely happened for sure. You're dealing with a power structure that values money over a certain aspects of humanity for sure. 100% but we've gotta be honest about what's happening and what's not happening. Southwest is not spraying artificial clouds. They're accidentally making them in a natural byproduct of a jet engine passing through condensation. But it doesn't mean that people haven't done evil shit in the past. It just means that's what that is. And people are getting so fucking mad at me on Twitter and calling me a shill and a government agent and thinking that somehow or another, um, um, I'm changing the truth because I want to protect myself or something. It's just,

Speaker 3:          00:10:00       I think people are looking for like a reason, something to blame, you know, the lack of health and feeling good and you know, on, and I think that they, they do that and then they roll in, they blame it on the chem trails and they roll into Mcdonald's and eat five big macs and wonder why they're feeling shitty. They think they're just spraying stuff down on that.

Speaker 1:          00:10:19       Have you ever seen the one, the video with prince on the prince sitting with Dick Gregory, pull it up. Prince talks about chem trails. Prints is talking about chem trails in the hood and friends, for instance, one of the banners, rock and rollers of all the tile. And he's talking about chem trails, um, in the hood when he was growing up. And it's, it sounds like he's singing a song. Like it's like almost lyrical. Like the way he looks at it. It's like sometimes no clothes in a thought. It was purple rain. Yeah. The, the video is, the video is really quite fascinating. It's, did you find it? Yeah. Okay. I play this bitch

Speaker 4:          00:10:58       like Jackson, like Jack. Yeah. Oh, it's not that great. I'm sorry. Well, because I knew I was right. You know, we talked about this in our very first interview and conversation together. Um, it's obvious now that artists are supposed to own their master recordings. Okay. This isn't the part will be, there's a part where he talks about chemistry takes them bodies. Oh, it's, it's Prince Dick Gregory. You started to see a whole bunch of, Huh, here we go. Phenomena of chem trails. Okay. And you know, when I was a kid, I used to see these trails in the sky all the time. And so that's cool. A jet just went over and then you started to see a whole bunch of, and next thing you know, everybody in your neighborhood was fighting and arguing and you did know why. Okay. And, and you really didn't know why. I mean, everybody was fine. So he, he started riffing about the chem trails and he started to say things that, uh, hit home so hard. And I would recommend that everybody try to get what he said online or wherever and try to get a copy of it and just listen to it.

Speaker 4:          00:12:18       I'm so moved that I had to write the song.

Speaker 1:          00:12:21       He wrote a song about chem trails. Really, when you lean, what? All the half,

Speaker 4:          00:12:28       what is this?

Speaker 1:          00:12:30       That's just ancillary video. That's actually Dick Gregory. That's the guy who brought these approved or filmed of the Geraldo Rivera show. Dick Gregory, the older guy. He, uh, was a standup comedian, like an activist and he, he bought this approved or film to a Geraldo Rivera show and showed it on television. President Kennedy getting shot for the first time. It's actually in the 1970s long after his death, he died in [inaudible] 63 they, they showed it on TV, I think I'm like 72 or something like that. 72 73 it might have been, you would have done that. Yeah. They showed the actual, it might've been 75. The uh, um, yeah, they showed the actual gunshot to the head on national television. Even showed a close up on it and Geraldo Rivera was the conspiracy theorist back then. Geraldo Rivera who now works for Fox News back then. He was saying the clot shot clearly comes from the front as you see his head snapped back into the left. Like wow. It's interesting. Really.

Speaker 3:          00:13:20       It is tough to argue that. I mean, I'd love to, I'd love to see that broken down. Like how do you explain his head going in front to back, but how crazy his prints on KemTrace. Oh my goodness.

Speaker 1:          00:13:32       It's like you listen to that and you're like, wow. And all of a sudden everyone's fighting. And I couldn't figure

Speaker 3:          00:13:39       when I was a kid, there was only a few airplanes. And then as the airplane business got bigger, there was more airplanes.

Speaker 1:          00:13:47       Well, when he's saying actually kind of flies in the face of the traditional camp trail fears, they believe that these, these long lines in the sky didn't exist in the past and that they are fairly recent. But there's like photos from like the 80s and shit and people took where there's these lines in the sky and it looks like artificial clouds and it's just, it's just part of the process of flying a jet and mean it's, it, it does create a cloud though. And people will likely, these clouds are blanking up. The Sky was, it was really clear until they flew by. That is true. It does happen. Is that, that is real.

Speaker 3:          00:14:17       Yeah. And it goes along with what you're saying about it, the planes making it because, uh, planes have gotten bigger and bigger as the years have gone on. They didn't always have a seven 40 centers, seven 57 you know, so as these are getting bigger, of course the uh, the chem trails will be too, it seems at least,

Speaker 1:          00:14:33       well there's, you know, the other thing that's real is that it changes the temperature of the earth. That is a fact, in fact, that the temperature change quite a bit after nine 11. Do you remember what it was like when nine 11 happened and then also no one was flying for like two weeks? Yeah. What changed the temperature of the earth? But I forget if it heated up or it down. Let's see, uh, temperature changed nine one, one, let's say. Cool. Dan, what would you say? Yeah, I would say that. Yeah, I think so too. Opposite reaction. Right, right. Okay. Let's say temperature change after nine one one air traffic affects the climate. Yeah, yeah. Let's do this. Oh yeah. And then that seems like the piece that I know, the purity of the air definitely changes temperature and then everybody's tears even says it in here.

Speaker 1:          00:15:18       Listen to this. During the three day commercial flight hiatus when artificial clouds known as con trails all but disappeared. So they're like admitting on CNN that these planes create artificial clouds. Like no one's tried to hide it. This isn't like some crazy conspiracy that people wondering about. But artificial clouds known as has all but disappeared. The variations in high and low temperatures increased by 1.1 degrees. Interesting each day. Said meteorology, meteorological researchers. That's interesting. I don't know if that's, I don't know if that means anything though. It's so hard to tell cause like the temperature fluctuates by more than a degree every day anyway. And if it goes up, I mean it could be, I mean I'm an idiot, but I'm reading this and I'm gonna go on. Are you sure? Anyway, the point is in this, even in this CNN paper from 2002 it says artificial clouds known as con trails, I think.

Speaker 1:          00:16:15       But people are looking at them, they think it's something that didn't happen before. They're like they, oh, I didn't, these weren't there before. It doesn't mean that people haven't sprayed shit out of planes. But what it does mean is that what you're seeing is not what you think is happening. Most of the time when you see this spray, what you're seeing is a fucking cloud. That's what happens when it goes through the jet. But if it was a spray, it wouldn't look like that. If it was aluminum and Barium, which is like what they're claiming the government for some reason to spraying in the sky, it would be more like smoke signals or like a, um, those things behind a plane to smoke writer. It would linger in the sky. But those are, those are heavy metals. Those are particles. Even if they're nanoparticles, they're going to fall, they waste something.

Speaker 1:          00:16:58       It's not going to be like moisture in the air, which just lingers like a cloud was. We know about clouds, we don't know about shit that like sits up in the clouds, but it's actually aluminum. It just floats up there. Well, that's not even, that's not even possible. It would fall, would fall out of the sky. It's not the same thing. So I understand people's mistrust of the government. I understand that people are, but you can't, when, when something's explainable, you got to explain it. You know, and it doesn't, doesn't remove all the other possibilities than the fairies doings. But it does explain one thing that people are trying to point in the wrong direction. And the problem is if you, if you pointing that direction and then people can prove that that's not what's going on, but you won't let it go, then they're not going to listen to you when it comes to other shitty either.

Speaker 1:          00:17:44       You know, they're gonna, they're gonna Think, oh you're that guy that believes this shit that's kind of wacky and this is one of those things. It's a tricky one man. It's really tricky. Yeah. Cause it looks like they're fucking spraying artificial clouds. Right. And in effect, they are making artificial clouds. That is a fact. The guy in the show that one of the craziest moments was that he, um, had this a test that he did this water test and he showed that there's aluminum in the water, but you look at the test results, the t like the from the lab and it says sludge. So like, and I go, well, so, so it's got dirt in it, not just water, but it says sludge like to test results, say sludge. And all sludge has aluminum in it because all dirt has aluminum in it. So it's not testing water from aluminum that fell from the sky.

Speaker 1:          00:18:26       You're testing water for having dirt in it, which also is always has aluminum in it. Yeah. So that was a good owning by the way. I didn't want to own them. I look, I'll, I'll, you know, I just, I wish these guys had approached some of these things with a little bit more of an open mind and you know, and not just go one way or the other, but that's one, one of the things we're seeing over and over again on this show, so people just, they get an idea in their head and they just fucking and run with it. Right. I thought that that little town or whatever city that, that the sound was coming from, I thought that was the one in the most interesting things about the episode from yesterday. But did they even, did you even figure out if it was coming from that?

Speaker 1:          00:19:07       No one can tell. No one can tell. Did you hear it? No, I didn't hear it. The, the people that experienced it, they said it was really bad a couple of years ago. It got better, but occasionally it still happens. It's like this weird hum that's in this town and they, no one knows what the hell is causing it. Whoa. Yeah. It's like, it's like we lost, like rattles your windows and stuff and, and it's in this area of Canada called Windsor, Ontario. It's like, well documented. There's, there's terabytes of this hum online. Nobody could figure out what the hell it is. And some people believe it's, uh, there's a lot of like crazy conspiracies. One of them being that it's a harp repeater station harp is this gigantic antenna array that's in Alaska that they send radio signals up into the ionosphere. But you know, who knows what the hell it is.

Speaker 1:          00:19:53       There's another thing to take into consideration that nobody was willing to consider, but it is possible that they, uh, they dig under the ground around there for salt, you know, and they're, uh, their salt mining and they say it wasn't, you know, that wasn't happening while the sound was going on, but, you know, I don't, I don't know how the fuck do, you know, it's a weird thing though. There's all these people experiences. It's not just like a couple of cuckoo heads see dragons. There's like a lot of people and they record it, you know? Wow. Yeah. That's pretty freaky. That one guy said he had seven terabytes that I wish you had challenged him on that. No, no. He does. He does. He record that shit for like the entire night. He likes, he'll set it up. He has like a recorder and you're like seven MP, three recorder up and tape through the night.

Speaker 1:          00:20:34       Yeah. I really believe him because he has, he's been following this and being an activist on this shit for you. Imagine if you lived there man, and all sudden you fucking windows are rattling in the middle of the night. Well, yeah, I would move. Fuck, well they don't have any money. I wouldn't move to if you had some money, but if you don't have any money, man, oh shit. And you're stuck there and you can't go to sleep and then you have to get to go to work in the morning and you're fucking exhausted because your house has been humming.

Speaker 3:          00:20:57       Windsor is a pretty interesting tags. That's where everybody from Ohio and Michigan goes to get drunk when they're 18 because you cannot drink there before you're 21 oh really good example clubs. Yeah, Jamie [inaudible]. It's like you go there and you fast forward three years of your life and you can do anything you want at 18 if you just go over it.

Speaker 1:          00:21:17       Bridge. Yeah. Well Detroit is fucking crazy, man. If you never been to Detroit before, I recommend going just to see the $39 houses, house houses for sale for $39 dude, you could buy a house for $39 they told us we could buy a house for $500 and I thought they were fucking crazy. And then someone from the Rogan board found a house for $39 wow. Jesus do. They just went bankrupt. The entire city went bankrupt. It almost seems like it's almost like an apple stock at the very beginning. Like we should buy all these $39 houses. You know, like, like while they're this, you know what, man, it might not come back in your lifetime. It might be. What we're seeing might be when people find the ruins of ancient cities in the past. Sometimes cities just go so far down. They never come back.

Speaker 1:          00:22:04       Sometimes cities stick around forever. Like Rome. You could drive by the fucking coliseum today. Somehow or another, they managed to keep some form of a society around in that area for all these years. It changed. It morphed, but there's still people there. They still a society, but fucking Detroit is close. It's close, man. It's 47% illiteracy rate. 47 47% illiteracy rate. Yeah. It's crazy. I mean, it is, it is one of the craziest places in the world and it's in America. It's a place that used to thrive. Think about like the fifties and sixties like the, the roaring times for the auto industry. They're making fucking 69 Chevy's and everybody's making money and his union workers and everyone's getting paid well, and then all of a sudden somewhere along the line jams like, we're out of here, dog. We're going to take our shit to Mexico. We're going to make cars in China. We're going to, you guys cost too much money. We're tired of this shit. And they pull out and it's catastrophic. Oh yeah. I mean, you seem Roger and me, uh, the Michael Moore. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. It's all about that. It's all about Flint, Michigan. It's all about the watching these towns implode when the jobs aren't there anymore. The Luda jobs literally pull out of the community and Poof, that's it. They're gone. And then everybody's like, oh my God, how do I eat? And then it's fucking crazy that's going on, right.

Speaker 3:          00:23:23       The city where I'm from, uh, just got ranked. I, there was an article, I tweeted the number one most dilapidated city or something like that, and it used to be the number one steel producing city for the entire world. And they built it there because it was so cloudy that back in the day satellites couldn't see through clouds. Oh my God. So they built it all in Youngstown, Ohio, which has the weird lake effect. So there's always clouds over where I'm from pretty much. And uh, and um, so the whole steel industry was there and then it, uh, it's nothing. I mean, it, there is nothing there now. That's incredible. It's really wild. It was a big, big, big steel producing city and uh, and Mafia town. And they got rid of the mafia and the nineties and steel, like the seventies super mafia town. Yeah, that's actually a what my parents, uh, my parents were in that business before.

Speaker 1:          00:24:19       Um, they did some shady stuff. Family things. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:24:23       they were, they were almost, almost everybody that my parents knew as well. They knew them from being, you know, in some kind of business. Like my mom for example, ran numbers, you know, number running. It's like a form of racketeering and the illegal lottery. So she would be the center person of this entire thing. All the people that would call in their numbers would call her and uh, and that's what just what she did.

Speaker 1:          00:24:48       Wow. That's incredible. Yeah. My uh, grandmother went to jail for numbers running. Really? Yeah. She apparently got caught. You know, what she would do was she'd be like the go between or something. She would like move things, you know, I was like a job I guess. And they arrested her and she didn't want to rat anybody out. So she spent like six months in jail. Wow. Yeah. I didn't even know about it until I was like in my twenties you know, my mom never told us about it. Yeah, it's interesting. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:25:13       She had no choice but to tell me because when I was a kid, you know how when you're a kid and the phone rings, you try to pick it up. Hello. Well people would ask for a, for Gina and my mom's name, joy. So when they're like, hello is Gina, is Gina, is Gina available? No, Gina lives here. Sorry. And I remember one day I told my mom, I go, mom, people keep calling asking for Gina. She goes, what are you doing with these phone calls? What do you mean? And like, you know, cause she obviously she was missing business. I was just being a little kid being helpful. No, Gina here. Sorry. Oh Wow. But uh, and so very young, I had to realize what she was doing because also she was on the phone a lot and she would be repeating back these numbers to people.

Speaker 3:          00:25:49       And there's like all this terminology and stuff like Po and box and all these different things like that. Straight or boxed, which means like straight means you're picking three numbers in a row, like four, six, seven and box means you could have four, six, seven but if it comes out seven, four, six or six, four, seven or whatever you win either way. So there's all this terminology. So you'd hear on the phone three, three, four force it cause she would repeat back the numbers that they just gave her to confirm. So it's like unbelievable. Wow. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:26:18       So that's who you grew up in that environment. Did you, did you ever see anything like dangerous or was it just like gambling type stuff?

Speaker 3:          00:26:25       Nothing dangerous ever. The closest thing that, uh, the closest thing that I had a weird feeling about when I was a kid was one time my dad came to visit cause I lived with my mom. So my dad would just come in and visit sometimes. And the weirdest thing was he came in, came over when the day with a, uh, with a cast on, with a cast on his hand. And I'm like, how'd you break hand? And I remember

Speaker 5:          00:26:44       my mom looking at him weird and him looking at her, we, I don't, I still don't know exactly what happened with the, with a broken hand. But I mean, I don't know. It could be like a punishment. He could've beat somebody up. He was, he owned a restaurant, uh, at the time. So it's not like he, he didn't do, he didn't and he wasn't the hands on guy at the restaurant. I don't know how he broke his hand. Yeah. We're going to have to leave that one to yeah, yeah, yeah. Suspicions. Yeah. It'd be nice to, Alicia didn't like make something up like to fill in the blank to make the story better. Right. No, exactly. I keep it real. Yeah. Isn't it weird when you really stop and think about how little our parents knew about the world? Like now that we live in this really strange place where we're finding out like pretty, you mean you just ask your phone and it's in a lancer, you almost, any question you can come up with and you just think about growing up and having kids and living your whole life without that and you're like, my God.

Speaker 5:          00:27:42       Like is that even society? Was that even civilization? Wow. Our poor fucking parents. It's unbelievable. They were lucky they had phones. Oh yeah. They really, where there's apes. I know the evolution of everything's crazy. I just found out there's a, a high school district in La in which all the kids are getting iPads now. So they upload all their information on the IPAD and that's their only book send out. They're done with books. And think about how many tons of pounds of books we carried on our shoulders. His kids for no reason. There's a jet, there's generations to come that will never know that feeling. They're going to look at us like, what do you mean you were carrying books around? It doesn't make any p tons of paper stacked on top. What is that? Why would you do that? I don't get it as they scan through nothingness. You know what I mean? It's thinking about that the other day about how paper and books, it's just going to be this and take well how are you starting to see like some of these different phones that are coming out that allow you to answer and scroll and do things without actually touching the phone and that when you look away from the phone like it changes the way the phone behave.

Speaker 2:          00:28:50       Look at it. Yeah. Yes for does that. Yeah. I think three also where you could just wave your hand over to like answer our phone call as well. I don't know. The four does though. There's a lot of like weird shit's happening was like the ability to like just conjure things up out of the air with your hands and your, your you'll looks, it just doesn't seem like a good idea because he's like, give me like laying in bed, like phone ringing and you like with wave over it now you just have a video call and your Dick's just like in the, you know, like, it just seems like a problem for Brian, right? Yeah. If you sleep with your Dick next to your phone, you'd have pull your dick out every time the phone rings just on instinct. Oh, we doing this? Okay, we're doing this. You want to do this? Yeah. No, I think that what I was getting at is that, uh, it's, it's, it's going to get weird and to live the human

Speaker 5:          00:29:34       computer, human information interface is going to get weirder and weirder. It's the, who knows what the limit is way. This is going to be

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       a bit something implant or something. Oh yeah, totally. Something you see, you scrolling through things, there's going to be a point to even wear wearing a lens or something is going to be like, oh look, that's peppers and still wearing the lens. No balls to get a fucking operation buddy. Right? You're afraid of neural implant starts, they'll do something to your eye and then they realize no, you really got to get to their cerebral cortex itself. Right. So it'd be like it'd be looking at people like they pierce their ears. Did you get your brain peers? Yeah, just going right down the factory line in the baby ward, whatever those are called. Duncan and I were talking about this and we both agree that there's gonna come a time where you're probably not gonna use your regular memory anymore, that you regularly memory will be replaced by some sort of internal digital storage, which can record everything you see in total real time HD.

Speaker 2:          00:30:30       Right? I mean that's pretty pretty likely to be what we're dealing with in the future and then we're going to swap hard drives and shit and I'm going to be able to watch 20 inch clamp. It really is. It's going to be, it's going to be like the Matrix, how they just upload information. Yeah. It seems like it's inevitable. They've already figured out a way to um, uh, put artificial memories in a mouse. Have you heard of that? Yeah. Yeah. They figured out a way to do that to mice. They figured out a way to somehow or another install and artificial memory in a mouse and they also figured out how to make a cat's tail move without a, actually like a man with a brain thing on can make a cat's tail move wirelessly somehow or another. I need to do that. Man. That sounds awesome.

Speaker 2:          00:31:11       It's fucking nuts. I put it up on Twitter. If you could find it. It was within the last day or two. Maybe Jamie can help you. The, uh, the story is a, it's pretty fucking freaky. The ability to control another thing. Me Even it's just a cat with your brain. What the fuck is going to happen in the future? People are going to force people to walk into their houses and blow them and having your pet will be a totally different experience. Like that would be like your warrior. Like all right Kat, go in the kitchen and see if there's anybody there like your, cause if you could make the cat tail move totally in 20 years you'll be able to control your cat. So your animal, your dog or pit bull or whatever would now be like your weapon or like your Hawk as a needle, like a pirate.

Speaker 2:          00:31:50       Especially when you could kind of do that enough. You train your dog really well, but you might be able to control it with your mind and see through its eyes, eyes and feel. It's, it's some game of Thrones anyway. Yeah. That would be crazy. When you imagine if you killed somebody with your dog and then there'd be like some crazy legal thing. Like it wasn't my idea. The dog went fucking crazy. Okay. I'm trying to control the dog with the brain. I'm just not that good at it yet. The dog went crazy and killed the burglar. Okay, I'm not a murderer or we're having like an eagle or having some kind of huge bird or a gorilla. Like you can control animals that, yeah, well they, you can control a few animals to do a few things, you know, like they, have you ever seen those videos of Mongols? This is the, uh, the brain. Harvard creates brain to brain interface, allowing humans to control other animals with thoughts alone. Wow.

Speaker 1:          00:32:41       Hitting these Zale entails hooked up to this thing and he figured out a way to make the tail move so we can already have the cat's tail answer, uh, galaxy three phone. So it's, it seems like it's just a matter of time before you're able to control everything the cat does. And then that'll be like version one. And then eventually virgin too will be, you'll be able to see what the cat sees. Wow. It's crazy. It's fucked up wild. That's what it's turning into human beings. Uh, just wanting to be cats and stuff just because they may like the cats. Like, Hey, where's this guy? Can I be a human? It's so crazy, so crazy. It's all so crazy. It's weird. It's so crazy. It's weird because you wonder like, where is this going and there's no way to know or else we would. Well, it seems like it is not going to stop.

Speaker 1:          00:33:31       It's just going to get more and more invasive. More and more. You're going to be able to do all kinds of really strange things within the next few years or they're going to someone, whoever has that kind of technology controlling a fucking cat's tail. Jay's. Dot. This is awesome. Have you ever seen those videos of the Mongols that hunt wolves with the eagles? Holy Shit, dude. Golden Wool. Golden Eagles might be the most gangster animal on the planet because they do not give two fucks about a wolf and they swooped down and kill a wolf. What their out their talents. I showed it to Steve Vanilla. He's a hunter. He's just got that show of meat eater. He's unimpressed. He said they were more coyote looking wolves. There weren't the biggest wolves in the world, which I'll give you that there's still fucking wolves, right bird. Think about that. You weigh about 140 pounds.

Speaker 1:          00:34:24       Tony Hinchcliffe. Could you imagine if you had to kill a 60 pound wolf with your fucking teeth? Now you have to tackle wolf and then kill it with your face. You know how the w, you know an eagle weighs 25 pounds and it does. That swoops in and Jack's a fucking wolf with its face, clings onto the back of this thing, attacks it and, and takes it out cold quick. Watch this shit. Watch this shit. You got it. No, no. Pull it up. Mongols hunt with eagles. It's going to trip you out, man. I watched this once a month. The Eagle comes back to the Mongol. Yup. Kills the, he kills the wolf and then they use the wolf. Are they buy them? They take their first. Wow. They make like hats out of them and shit. I don't understand why the Eagle does that. Cause they're gangster. They don't give a fuck. Watch this shit. This is really trippy, man. Look at this fucking bird. This is agent of death soaring dinosaur of death. Watch this. Bam Bitch. Just that wolf knows it's coming to. It fucks him up so quick. It just gets those claws around its neck and it's a wrap within seconds. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:35:34       look at that heartless motherfucker. Watch this shit.

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       The wolves running is poor wolf was like, oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me. This guy just let's this monster loose off of his arm.

Speaker 6:          00:35:48       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:35:49       And it knows exactly what to do. The Wolf is running and the Eagle just count. The Wolf was like, oh, fuck my life. Fuck my life.

Speaker 6:          00:36:00       Look at that thing, man. Ego Sung this song. I wish that Eagle Sung the song. I love the eagles.

Speaker 2:          00:36:10       Welcome to the the phone. Watch this. Bam Bitch, man. It just takes them out within seconds. It's incredible how lethal these things are. That's why I look at those dudes. What a dumb way to dress Lilly. I can train an eagle to kill a wolf, still wearing a toilet. Paper rolls on their heads and it's straight. I guess it's cold as fuck there though. You know they probably need all that stupid shit on just to stay alive. Yeah. Just think of how much time it must take to train a fucking eagle to kill a wolf. Like how many eagles did you let go and they never came back. How many, how many eagles did you let go and be like, bitch, I'm not killing. I won't even know that. Well Fuck you man. Right? Flying South. It's cold up here. I wonder if the eagles just can't help themselves and when something is running they just go get it. You know, I wonder if it's that this is terrifying animals. I saw one the other day in Seattle, so fucking Eagle, they have eagles up there and it had something in his hands. That one got something, some sort of fish or something.

Speaker 7:          00:37:15       I've been noticing a lot of parrots lately in Burbank, just like real mobs of parrots like flying over my like, like for 20 the other day and they're all green with like the red.

Speaker 2:          00:37:24       It's like how Florida has pythons lose cause people let them go right in Burbank. It's parents. I fucking hate my bird opened the window, get out pitch right.

Speaker 7:          00:37:32       There was a friend who lives up here in Calabasas and he, he has, he lives on like the place where they film true blood. Like, it's, it's huge, huge mansion type thing. But he was talking about the other day how a tarantula somehow God was in him. Like he has the crazy, he lives on this crazy like humongous thing in the mountain. So you know the caliber or Santa Monica Mountains and there's all these weird things like, like, like lizards and snakes. But when he got, had a tranche let in his, in his bedroom the other day and he's like, well, I don't know how the fuck it got.

Speaker 2:          00:38:02       Yeah, there's Tarantulas in California. It's creating, get him anywhere in the La area. I like people that live in the Hollywood hills, you know when they have a problem with the Hollywood hills rats. Yeah, I see. I see tons of Burbank. I know a story. I don't know if it's true, but I'll tell it anyway about Sylvester Stallone, apparently that someone went to a Sylvester Stallone's house. He had a house in the Hollywood hills and when they were, he had a movie theater and he told them, he goes, put your feet up when you watch the movie because we have rats. Like what? Like they couldn't get rid of the rats. The rats were just like so infested in the hills up there that you would have, I'm like running through your house. Sometimes

Speaker 7:          00:38:37       they ran on the power lines outside. Like I'll sit out back and you just see rats running on it and then one time a rat came up and stepped on my foot or something like that. And I will you barefoot? Yeah. Oh my. I uh, through my laptop. It was like the first time I had bought a new Mac book and I opened it up for the first time and I'm looking at like, oh, look how nice and sexy this is. Rat right on foot throws laptop up in the air, falls down. No, it fell down to break. No, luckily just landed fine. Build quality.

Speaker 1:          00:39:05       Yeah. Powerful IPOD, iPhone, apple product pitch. Yeah. Um, rats were fucking gross. They've carried disgusting disease is to have those fucks. Oh, they, the black plague came from a rats carrying a tick, I think, I think, or a flea or something like that. I think that's what it was. Right. Something like that. I think it was some sort of a parasitic thing that rats were carrying bugs gave them,

Speaker 7:          00:39:28       well it's so gross and I'm one of those people where like if I, if I were to see a rat or a cockroach where I live, I would just move. Well

Speaker 1:          00:39:35       that's one of the realities of living in New York City. You know, if you want to live in New York City, you're going to see roaches and you're going to see rats if you're paying attention. When I lived in New York, there was one time I never lived in the city. I lived in new Rochelle, which is like just outside the city, like outside of the Bronx, little suburb, Westchester. Um, I parked my car at this gas station and it was back when there was payphones. I didn't have a car phone. I had to make a call. I had to like get out of the car. So I'm making a call on this payphone. As my car is parked, I'm watching rats jump on top of the tires and climb up into the car. I'm watching them and I'm like, what the fuck? I mean, not one, like three, four, five.

Speaker 1:          00:40:13       They just kept doing it, looking for food, like the car parked. So they jumped on the back tire that run over the top of the tire to run under the car. They ran up into the engine compartment and sometimes they just stay in the engine department. You're fucking fan tears them apart cause they're stupid heads are in there and you start the car up and fucking you open up the hood and just splatter everywhere because I'm stupid rat got inside of your fan. Yeah man. They look for food everywhere. They'll burrow the themselves and the little tiny holes to try to search for something that might be food. That's Yonkers. Yeah, well it was actually, that was in Manhattan. It was in New York City. Uh, I'll never forget it. I was just like, what? What the fuck? And then when you find out that there's this many rats in New York City as there are people, there's this, there's 7 million people in New York City. So there's 7 million rats in New York City. Imagine controlling those rats. They really have a hard time. I think a lot of them drowned in Sandy. I think a lot of, uh, those underground layers and shit drown because, uh, Shane Smith did a video once read af after sandy a video about the possibility superstorms increasing and like a river of dead rats, like flowed by him as he was a, as you're standing there talking, I was like, Holy Shit, you thing, the thing that scared

Speaker 3:          00:41:34       me when I moved here was a, I lived in Burbank when I first got here and the Black Widows, oh yeah. First it's like almost a normal spider until you really look at that belly and you see that red diamond thing. Yeah. That's the part where you're just like this fucking thing. And it's, it's interesting how nature sort of a warns you about like, I like I've read things about snakes. If you see like red, yellow, black, and that spider, that red diamond, I mean if you look at it, it really, it's like a warning sign, right? Yeah. You're totally right. It's incredible how nature, uh, does that stuff. You know what else I saw recently is a thing about how butterflies, if you look at a, if you look at butterflies that are around area where snakes are, when their wings are up and they're just chilling, most of them look like snakes. Like if you look up a butterfly snake, uh, Eh, I mean it's unbelievable.

Speaker 2:          00:42:26       Wow. That makes sense. So then any intruder that comes by, it's like, oh shit. A snake instead of a look at this pussy butterfly I'm about to eat. You know? That's interesting. It's really incredible. Yeah. It's, it's weird when you see animals that have figured out how to mimic their environment, you know, like, have you ever seen octopus or Octopi that change their shape and their look to look exactly like the environment? Well, look at these crazy looking butterflies that totally looks like a snake. Right? That's incredible. Yup. Oh my God. That's what they do. That's amazing. Yeah. Wow. Folks who view of, you're not, obviously you don't watch most people listening. There's a, what is the, the Google that you go let her fly snake butterflies. Snake. There's one that looks like these two fucking syrup. It actually several that looked like it, but they look like these two serpent heads right next to each other. I mean, exactly under the underside. It's all looks that corner one. Oh my God. That's amazing. That's incredible.

Speaker 3:          00:43:27       Seen this by the way. You'll notice that in actually a lot of butterflies. It's not, it's not necessarily a rare thing at all. I'm pretty sure if they ever see a snake, they're pretty much like, well that's what I want.

Speaker 2:          00:43:37       That's amazing. That is really amazing. It looks just like it. Now look up. Um, octopus camouflage, octopus camouflage. He's really weird man, because they also think that they don't just look at that fucking, it looks like a butterfly. We're looking at the tip of the butterflies wound. That looks like a snake. I mean it has an eyeball and even has a nose. Yup. It's like Steve Harvey has a mouth immediately. It's a beautiful tattoo of a snake. Yeah. And it's the softest, most precious, easy to kill animal in the world. Butterfly of all the things. Yeah. They're like, they're like man, a mush. I mean they're softer than a fly there. A butterfly. Like they were like a tissue flies, right? Octopus or Octopi can blend in with their surroundings and they also think that they, their

Speaker 1:          00:44:31       ability to change shape on the outside of the camouflage. Look, they think they use that also to communicate that it's not just, um, that, that is incredible. It's incredible. We're looking at this octopus that's completely blended in with this white floor and there's also been ones that have eaten sharks. They had a problem at this aquarium where they're sharks started missing and they would find like shark carcasses. So they're like, what the fuck is going on? What's eating at shark? And so they watched this video, they set up a camera, see there's a video of it. Brian's even go watch it if you could find it. But it's, they do it on a regular basis. Like apparently octopus are smart as fuck or Octopi. And they set up this camera and um, they watched this octopus just sit there completely camouflaged and as his shock flies by him over the years. But when the keepers here

Speaker 6:          00:45:32       decided to move one into a larger tank with sharks and other big fish, they assumed that the octopuses strength and camouflage would keep it safe. Is it turned out they went tragically mistaken. Watch the sharks got a gun. It's Chardonnay though. So you see this thing swimming.

Speaker 8:          00:46:10       Watch this shit

Speaker 6:          00:46:13       like the shark has no idea that octopus is there dies in evil looking motherfucker, white eyes, wide eyes, completely camouflages with his environment. You're waiting for that motherfucker to get clothes. Watch this. It's like bitch, I got you. My God. So bad ass. And you know they have like teeth, like little beaks on the end of their, of their check suction cups. Yeah. It's like sharp, like little cat. Yeah. They found giant ones in a fossil and that they believe it. It could possibly be evidence for a cracking the idea of a crack and it's like an ancient mythology idea of a chai and octopus that would

Speaker 1:          00:46:59       take out ships and kill people. And they always thought it was just mythology and horseshit until they recently found these giant fucking suction cups and fossils. And then they realize, oh yeah, if the, if octopus die, they don't live behind anything. It's not like they're not like a person leaves behind a skull. The octopus are mollusks this movable, you know, sort of weird flexible material and all they have is like a beak. And that gets eaten by things like really quickly. So if they die, like you don't find shit, but somehow or another someone died and the imprint of it's suction cups left a mark on the floor and they're enormous. And so in looking at these, they were like, oh my God. Like this was a massive octopus. Like something that was just impossibly large. Oh Wow. Look at this. The octopus got this cat's face.

Speaker 1:          00:47:54       The cat got gangster and the, the octopus locked on its face and it's fucking this cat up. Look at this. Oh my God. It's like alien, like an alien face hugger. Octopussy is that a, um, a vine? So what that is? Give a gift. That's hilarious. Yeah. The cat cat. You think you're clever? Octopuses are so smart. They've, they've had videos that they've taken of them on security cameras where they climb out of a fish tank and go across the floor and climb into another fish tank and then eat the fish and then climb back. Like guy was missing like these expensive, efficient as fish tank. He's like, what the fuck is going on? So he set up his camera to look his fish tank and he watched his octopus climb out of his fucking fish tank, walk across the floor, climb up the other fish, stand the tank, stand climbing into the tank, lift the lid off of it. Jackfish kill it, walk across the street how back into his tank and go to sleep. I mean, Jesus Christ, it's what the fuck are those things believable? What are those things? Have you seen this? What is this? A bear

Speaker 7:          00:48:58       bear, uh, getting into a dumpster behind a restaurant, walking up to the back of the restaurant and there's this big humongous green dumpster, you know, full of old meats and stuff like that. Probably smart ass bear goes around the side of it. Let me see if I can fast forward it. Where did this take place? Um, I forget it. He starts going through it and then he does something amazing coming up right here. He's taking the whole entire dumpster and walking with it.

Speaker 1:          00:49:31       The Fuck Gotti. Wow.

Speaker 7:          00:49:35       And uh, yeah, if you keep on going, he actually starts pulling it, uh, around the corner.

Speaker 1:          00:49:42       Oh my God. Tom Credible. And that's like a humongous dumsor. That's like a double wide dumpster. Bears are so swollen. Then he comes back for the strong, I should say what? Um, then he comes back. Where does it say this is a,

Speaker 7:          00:49:59       let's see. Uh, do you do, do, it doesn't say it's just, Oh, Denver.

Speaker 1:          00:50:08       Denver totally makes sense. You know what's interesting is that they have a real problem when bears find out they can do that. They always come back. Like once a bear eats your garbage, you got to call somebody, you got a real problem. They either have to shoot it or they have to figure out a way to put it in a zoo or do something because once it knows it, can he get garbage. It just keeps eating your garbage. So if you live in a community that has bears and you have that asshole neighbor that leaves pizza boxes and is fucking garbage is sitting out there and a bear finds out about it, you're Foxville.

Speaker 5:          00:50:37       I'm so glad I don't live near big animals. When I was in Texas, they introduced me to the goats and these fucking things are crazy. He's a little goats that I thought were all cute and just like adorable or head butting each other at full. They're like, Tony, get on it and there goes, hey, these goats get on in there and I am just, I'm just not, not the guy to be in there with goats like, oh look at the little La Pussy boy with the goats. Look how scared he charge things or animals. Yeah, absolutely. Who wants to have it

Speaker 1:          00:51:08       fist fight with a kid? A house cat. Do you want to have a fist fight with a house cat? No. Fuck No. I'm a lot bigger than a house cat, but I wouldn't want to fuck with one. Right? Yeah. That cat was jumping off the furniture trying to claw your eyes out. Yeah. It gets scary animals. It's just so different than people. You don't want to fuck.

Speaker 5:          00:51:26       I got a little goat. I got home late the other night, even little Twix. He scared me. You know Brian's little dog, little white, perfect little baby. But I can, but I know I came home late. It's all dark and my living room and I see something on the couch like looking at me. I'm like, what the fuck is that? Because normally Trixie's blocked him probably about a 9.9 and uh, but uh, but normally she's blocked off upstairs and stays up there throughout the night. So this thing was on the couch and I could see it just standing out. I got really concerned. I'm like, what kind of fucking and am I know that's an animal looking at me. I flipped on the light and it's the cutest dog in the world, but I was really scared. I'm like, what kind of white is that? Like an all an albino raccoon that somehow climb through a window? I S my brain just started flying.

Speaker 1:          00:52:12       Well, somebody left their door open. It was a photo that was taken. Um, where was that? Was that you, Jamie? Did you find that there a photo taken of a coyote that was in someone's house? No, somebody showed it to me in an email. A coyote, a snuck into someone's house and I think it was in boulder and just, it was like in their house. So they opened up the front door and they see a coyote is sitting in their house and they're like, oh Jesus Christ. How do you get this fucking thing out? Right. Did you see the mountain lion that was a in the guy's garage? No. Yeah. Look up mountain lion and garage and in Colorado these guys had like a confrontation with the Mountain Lion Mountain Lion, like ran right past this guy and into a corner and the guy goes into the corner, try to chase a mountain lion out and the mount line runs past him again. And you watch this, you on what the fuck

Speaker 5:          00:52:57       things are happening in Colorado. They in and they just legalized pot. It sounds like the last thing you'd want after getting really stone, I'm going to go to the garage, grabbed a soda. I'm high as fuck. Oh, this is it. Yeah. This

Speaker 2:          00:53:08       is exactly it. So these guys, they saw the cat. There it is. Look in the yelling at it like, oh Jesus. They're going after it and then look, he steps in there. She's not back yet and it's going to run past it. Look at this. Whoa. And he kicked it as it ran. Pastor. That is nuts, man. Look at that thing. Go. Wow. That's so crazy, man. They weren't scared of that shit at all. Yeah, those are hunters. They were all wearing cammo does see that there are hunters probably. Yeah, but still you should be scared. So thing decides to jump you. You have problems with mine. Totally. You've got problems. I don't get that leverage. You can't choke out a mountain lion quite as easily as you can a human. The thing about mountain lions, those, there's so much food in Colorado, there's so many animals for them to eat so many rabbits and deer to so much for them. To Jack.

Speaker 7:          00:53:58       They don't really care. You could just probably have a spray bottle with those guys.

Speaker 2:          00:54:01       Just sit back and chill. Puppy. Come here, puppy.

Speaker 7:          00:54:07       Did you see the clip of Steve Harvey? Uh, uh, bringing up marijuana on family feud?

Speaker 2:          00:54:12       Oh No.

Speaker 7:          00:54:13       Well, yeah, it's pretty funny. Check this out. Hi. We got them top success named something that gets passed around.

Speaker 8:          00:54:23       Oh,

Speaker 7:          00:54:25       Chris, a joint.

Speaker 8:          00:54:27       Joel [inaudible] look at Steve Harvey's in questioning closes. I'm off. Oh, I am so wacky. The man says I've seen this before, haven't you? Yeah. Let's see what he says though. I don't remember. No, Chris. I don't know 100 people you thought we were talking to at some nice little mall across Goodall America, but I'm pretty sure that people didn't tell the survey. People Hae an illegal drug that's turned around and see how many we'd hands are out there with Chris hot joint. I believe it. He was talking shit against it. That's hilarious. But this is the best part. [inaudible] when you're know we're going to hear why it's weird. Okay, Tracy,

Speaker 7:          00:55:32       see only four else's topic.

Speaker 8:          00:55:34       So

Speaker 7:          00:55:37       the collection played at Church

Speaker 8:          00:55:39       [inaudible] he clapped cause he felt bad about saying joint. Yeah, the halo and I got no knowledge. So I'm like, I like the way you tried to stop us from going there. Hey, you missed you evil boy passing around. The little thing with this funny smell with can flush some saving here. Charge less than two weeks. That's created then the joint. This is not good. I'm just going to do, did

Speaker 7:          00:56:17       you just go over that? They're going to play this? Yes. Yeah. Wow. Similarities though. That is pretty, it's

Speaker 2:          00:56:24       funny to me that you know, if you said a beer, you know, no one gives a shit. Right. You know. But you say a joint like, oh my goodness, it really is such children. It's so bizarre. Such children pairing it to hell. Even he's a real like hardcore Christian. That guy. This is his audience is very, very Christian. He does like a, these big stadium church shows here. She knows. Yeah. You see one of those things that like makes the women in wheelchairs or walking? No, no, no, no. He just does stand up comedy and big church shows. He does. Uh, he has like radio show. He does a lot of different shit. That guy. These, yeah. I admire his hustle. Totally. Scott. A lot of things going on. He's got his own radio show. He does that show. He does stand up. He does these big church stand up shows.

Speaker 2:          00:57:10       It's not my style. I don't, you know, not my kind of comedy, but I admire the dude's hustle. I get, I enjoy when people are hustle. What are you guys laughing at? My God jam band just showed me this, this video and it's when it was fucked up. But you know Kevin Rose of Digg. Oh, with the rack. Yeah. She'll show that I at one time and rose found a raccoon attacking his dog. Yeah. He grabbed it and threw it off. Kevin Rose like he founded what? What did he, he found dig. He was on the screen savers, you know? Yeah. On g four and stuff, it says at 1:00 AM I heard my dog toaster crying and yelping and Panna discovered a raccoon and attack him. I do not encourage animal violence. I want to get the wild animals far away from us as possible. Toasters. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:57:49       Would have some claw and bite marks. So that's what it says at the beginning of the video and the video. You see this, this raccoon and the dog are fucking going at it. And so Kevin Rose runs down there, grabs a raccoon, slams it, and then kicks it. Holy Shit. He's gangster grabbed that thing. He didn't kick it first. He just reached out and grabbed his hands and then hulk slammed it. Wow. Oh Nelly. Oh Shit. Down a staircase isn't and yeah. Whoa. Now where is that a security camera that caught that? Yeah. Is that his house? Yeah. Wow. That's so crazy state. He grabbed that thing and hurled it like a, like a pillow. Yeah. Body-Slammed it. Hey, that's how you do it when you loved ones are in danger. You know? It's like when a woman picks up a truck to save her baby, you know, that kind of shit.

Speaker 2:          00:58:41       Yeah. I hit that freak strength. Think I would have just kicked it. I don't think I would touch it with my hand. I think I would just like, it's hard as I could. Yeah, I think you're right. I think I probably would've too. Who knows? Now you hear that yelping or your favorite little pet little wiki has uh, you might just, I would grab a raccoon off of your dog. You don't just go read eyed. You might just get crazy. But God, I was scary. Would it be that thing locked on your face? Sorry, I took my dog due to the vet and he had these canines I guess like puppy teeth, like they're supposed to fall out, but a lot of times their normal teeth will grow around their baby teeth. Yeah. You told me about this shit had to pull out all these man at poor

Speaker 1:          00:59:21       dog is just sitting there like looking at walls crying. Yeah. That's fucked up man. It's weird. Lincoln's he's a little breeds to, because you got to think like, what are those things like, I mean, how healthy is it to make an animal that weighs a pound, you know? Well, what's involved in that process? Is that like normal? It's a normal salary, something like that. It's not, it's not a tea cup or anything, it's just a shit. So yeah, it's a, yeah. A lot of people think it's like a tea cup, but I think it's just the, a rent or whatever it's called, you know, like that the baby of the litter is small one at the litter. Hm. That's called a ranch.

Speaker 3:          00:59:55       Yeah. I did some research on a twic sees a thing in the peak and knees dog. You know, they used to, uh, the how they came was they would have like Samurai warriors would just leave these beautiful little puppies in the bottom of their sleeves, so they'd walk around and be all the, you know, intimidating and stuff. So to offset that, they'd have these adorable little dogs as they would just walk around with them.

Speaker 1:          01:00:16       Yeah. Speaking of animals, Brian, I want you to go to this store. It's on the daily cause. Chaos. You ever go to that website? Go to daily cars.com and there's a story on, I'll tweet it because it's so fucking crazy. You're not going to believe it. This, these armed agents came into a no kill shelter. I just tweeted it. Um, you can find the link. These armed agents when they had a no kill shelter for like dogs, you know, so like if you don't want, you could, you could donate money and it's like a nonprofit. So like for a dog that goes to a pound, a lot of times they're in danger of being killed. So there's a few of these, no, no kill shelters that people set up to make sure that these animals don't die. Well, someone put a deer in one of these no kill shelters.

Speaker 1:          01:01:04       So aerial photos were taken. They saw the deer. A warrant was issued in a raid in sued by heavily armed agents. The staff was corralled, not permitted to make calls and cell phones were confiscated to delete pictures of the raid. And a baby deer named giggles by the staff was seized and stuffed into a body bag and then promptly killed by the agents. The presiding warden compared it to a drug raid to justify the Swat, like tactics. They compared it to a drug raid that having an illegal deer on the premise of baby deer that they've been taken care of was like having drugs. So they, this is, they came in there and this is in Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Department of natural resources agents and the Sheriff's deputies rated this nonprofit, no kill shelter, put this fucking baby deer in a bag and then killed it. This is insane. This, uh, the article says yes to your civilized world, heavily armed agents of a state government and the u s of a have raided a no kill animal shelter to execute with extreme prejudice and recognized

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       symbol for the gentleness, helplessness, and innocence. Yes, world. This is America. Today we're a militarized assault has become the answer to even the most minimal threat. It's really, um, I don't, I mean that's a really interesting, it's a really interesting article that, I mean, the way he just said that it's, it's really weird that they did that. They went in for this, dear specifically the word. Yeah, the word interesting is the wrong word. Obviously, I'm, I'm, I'm still kind of stunned by this, but that agents would want to do this, that they would want to go in armed like that. Like why are they so armed for a deer? Have they, have they given a reason why or have they made any comments? I don't know, man. I just read this. It's kind of crazy though. That is, I mean it's, it's a, it's a new story.

Speaker 2:          01:03:05       Um, it says 6:21 PM, and right now it's 7:57 PM where we are. Um, I don't know if this is Pacific time. Yes. It's specific times. So they is only a couple of hours old. Yeah. Today's August 1st buddy, isn't it a second? Second say the second already. Yeah. Oh my God. Where's this fucking life going? Slight flying by any way. The story's gone viral now. It's saying, did daily causes daily. KPOS excellent website. There's always like really interesting stories there. So go there and, uh, and check that out. And it's, if you're looking for the link to the story itself, it's on my Twitter feed, which is Joe Rogan. Um, it's also has a beautiful picture of Michelle Bachmann and on the front page, I'm that crazy conservative lady. Yeah. I love those crazy conservatives ladies. Maybe that Deere was like some kind of a government experiment and it got away. Oh, right. Maybe there's like 28 days later, dear, has to be something crazy for them.

Speaker 2:          01:04:01       I mean, killing the deer is one thing. Maybe they just board and then they wanted to, something to do and that was like a big deal. Just went in there and fucking deleting the pictures. That seems like a whole nother illegal move. It seems like you should be able to take whatever pictures you want your property. Yeah. They want, but they want to minimize any kind of political situation that would come up from killing the deer. And they probably thought the best way to do that is to stop any photos that are being taken, you know? Wow. Yeah. Kind of crazy. Really. Yeah. Just, it seems a little bit overkill. Maybe Wisconsin's just trying to act gangster so they get some attention. Uh, I don't know, man. It's, uh, it's just, it's hurts your feelings. Like, and this is coming from someone who's killed a deer. I killed a deer to eat it. I didn't just, someone has a baby pet deer and then send to a no kill rate. Just so crazy. I mean the, I mean the people, that would be the biggest animal lovers probably you could find with the ones that will be working there. So to do that to them it's like extra cruel. Another thing that's really bizarre. Did you say that they put them in a body bag and then kill them? Yeah. Like um, yeah, they, they just grabbed it and stuffed into a body

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       bag and then probably either club that are shot at and Kevin Rose throw down some stairs. Yeah. I mean, I knows, man, who knows what it is.

Speaker 5:          01:05:26       Normally you put things in a body bag after that. Seems like a lot of hard work. Yeah. Flailing leg.

Speaker 1:          01:05:33       It's horrible. It's really, it's weird. You know, you stop and think about it. It's like that someone could just just do that in front of me screaming, crying, people stuffed in a bag. And I said, right, of all the things, it just seems like it's not necessary. I mean, the only thing that you could say though, and this is true, is that they contain ticks and those ticks contained Lyme disease. That is possible. And if they were worried about Lyme disease spreading into these other animals and they were justifiably upset that these people brought it possibly contaminated dear, it does make sense that they would take the deer away and examine it. At least, you know, examining but thrown in a body bag and killing it. It's pretty fucking pretty cruel. It's like, why not? Why not be nice? Well, I do that. Pour a little deer.

Speaker 1:          01:06:21       Yeah, they're so cute. Really bad. Way To die. They're so cute, but they're so fucking delicious. It's like there's a battle going on with us, you know? You know what else is delicious? Rabbits delicious. And for a while people just, they had to eat them. There was no debate. And it's just like recently where people, you know, in the last few hundred years or so, people gotten to a point where you don't have to kill everything to eat it. So everything near us that's moving to get hit with a rock and fucking thrown into a fire. We don't have to do that anymore. So we have pets, we have pets that used to be our food. Yeah. You know, cute. Did Rapid. They're so fluffy. They are like, please don't eat us. We're not aggressive. We just hang out. Sometimes you got to eat them. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          01:07:02       I uh, I actually, uh, I don't think you know this about me, but I thought I just tarian I'm a Vegan. Total Vegan, right? Yeah. I knew there were some rollers. Yeah. I've known this for a long time. I'd always thought it was funny cause I love you're a secret Vegan bit that you do. And the first time I heard it was when I was working with you in Indianapolis and I'm back there cracking up and I said to myself, you know what? I'm going to keep this. I'm going to see how long I could be the opposite Vegan.

Speaker 1:          01:07:31       I knew you were at least a vegetarian for a long time. Yeah. Yeah. I think he came up maybe when we're hanging out. Yeah. Maybe till we go to dinner or something. We eat something. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. That's gotta be weird, man. When you're on the road,

Speaker 5:          01:07:42       know, annoying. So hard on the road. It really is. What do you do when you like on the road to do stand up? Luckily, you know, the, the main thing that I avoid is dairy. Um, I still eat fish, Sushi, salmon, all that. Oh, you do? Wait a minute. What the fuck are you talking about? You're not a Vegan. I'm a pescatarian. That doesn't eat dairy food. That is not being a Vegan. Oh yeah. Fish. But it's the butter and milk. That's the bad stuff. Yeah. But your vegans, most part, they're, they're doing it more as an, well, I would just say more,

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       but one of the major considerations is that they don't want to hurt animals.

Speaker 3:          01:08:19       Yeah. That's not my consideration on mine is so selfish. I just wanted to be happy all the time. That's what I was like. It has nothing to do with the animals.

Speaker 1:          01:08:26       And you found that altering your diet has a big change on how you, uh, how you feel

Speaker 3:          01:08:32       big time. In what way? Creativity. Creatively and really, absolutely. I mean, we'll see what used to happen was that down that I would get after eating. I mean, that's just exhausting and I'm very reactive to that. I like coffee and I like being able to be in position to do something. You know, I'm so used to really bother me in, first I cut out meat, I'm like, Jay, it's something with my eating because I would just crashed so hard after every meal I'd want to take a nap. So then I went a few months and I've done it before and both times it's been this way. But this time I've kept it for a year and a half. And, but once I cut out the dairy, sour cream, the cheese, it's, it's hard in the beginning, but it's not really, once you just go round at once you have vegan cheese in your house.

Speaker 3:          01:09:18       It's pretty much straight cause then you can make a pizza or whatever, you know, you could throw something together if you really are craving it and uh, but yeah, that, that uh, that edge and the negativity and sort of depression like symptoms that I was feeling pretty much throughout my whole life up until the point really dissipated after the dairy Wiscon almost instantly by the way, like to the meal once I started eliminating cheese was really the main thing cause I'd have cheese on every sandwich. So delicious though, right? I think we can choose, you can use to it and there's, there's great ways around it. You know, Avocados. Great.

Speaker 1:          01:09:51       For me, it's one month now with no gluten. Oh Wow. One month where I haven't had any, it's a completely changed my diet. I only eat vegetables and meats and chicken and fish and things along those lines. Occasionally I have rice, but not very often. But I've completely cut out all pasta, completely cut out all bread and I know a loan us a lot of differences. The, the, I don't feel when I eat, even if I'm full, I don't need to eat anymore. I don't feel bloated. I don't have the, uh, there's a feeling that she eat. Dude, I can put away some fucking food, right? I would eat a giant whole pizza by myself, like with all sorts of shit on it, Pepperoni and sausage. And I will fuck up a big pizza to the point where I just, I the, the last couple of slices, I'm just trying to prove a point, right?

Speaker 1:          01:10:36       I'm just, just, just showing what a fat fucking pig I can be in stuff this down my throat. But the feeling after that, when that cement is digesting in my stomach, that paste when it's all smashed up with my teeth in and packed into a ball of just barely digestible, fart fuel. I mean, that's what it is. I'm just cutting horrible farts and listen to my stomach rumble and it just stretched out in ageing. That's gone. I all by one of the reasons why I did it because I talked to someone about my back, um, which has gotten a lot better. Um, and, and thank you everybody who's had back injuries and given me tips whether it's on Twitter, on the message board. A lot of people gave me some great suggestions of different shit to do. [inaudible] um, including Dave Asprey told me about ozone prolozone therapy.

Speaker 1:          01:11:30       It's prolotherapy with ozone, which helped me quite a bit. Really interesting, interesting stuff. But this tea, this lady told me cut out gluten. She said she, um, she, she's a therapist, a physical therapist and her and her husband both work with like high level athletes and one of the things they said is like, we've had really good results in getting people to stop eating gluten and a lot of inflammation goes down and people that have had like back issues just in cutting out the gluten, the inflammation from their disc swelling and stuff has gone down considerably to the point where it becomes asymptomatic. And I thought that was so crazy. I was like, how could gluten like have that much of an effect on yeah, but man, it fucking does. I'm only been a month. It's a, it's about, you know, roughly a month now. But I have much less aches and pains in joints.

Speaker 1:          01:12:15       My face looks thinner like my face is like and I'm, I'm not, I'm still eating like as much as I want. I'm not like a, I'm not like, I wouldn't say I'm limiting my calories or dieting but I'm losing body fat and my stomach is going down. I know this is book wheat belly, I haven't read it yet, but apparently when they talk about is like, like how many people have like belly fat from eating gluten and wheat and like that. It just just packs it on you. But I noticed my stomach on television, I was like my God, it's kind of sticking out a little bit cause I haven't been able to work out as much because of my back. All that shit's gone. I'll let you, it's gone as soon as I cut out gluten. I can tell in your face. Yeah, it's my favorite skin. Pretty fat man that's, I carry weight in my face. It's one of the first places I carry it for whatever reason in my Dick. So fortunately, fortunately and unfortunately my is my Dick is looking like a runner but dick looks like a jogger.

Speaker 1:          01:13:10       Shocker. I was want my dick was like a bulldog instead. It looks like a like a jogger with a headband. But I would recommend anybody trying it, you know, but some people say it's nonsense. Um, but uh, one of the things I found out about the Internet, the Internet is a beautiful resource but no matter what, there's going to be a certain amount of people that think something sucks, right? It could be the most awesome shit that's ever existed. I've seen people say the black keys fucking suck. I've seen people say Louis C K fucking songs I've seen believe you'll say Dave Chappelle fucking socks. Everything that is awesome in the world. Someone out there is saying it sucks. Just search the keywords on Twitter and you'll find people saying the dumbest stuff in the world is so much of it is people not talking in person to other people and not like having to like have like a sort of like a, an cooperative interactive exchange with people instead of that like communicating with people and seeing them in a full three dimensional to person, to person sort of a way. Just the ability to like, yeah,

Speaker 9:          01:14:17       Eh, right. Flagging. Just get online. Me fucking Tony Hinchcliffe you could get funny. A fucking queen. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:14:26       Yeah. They just throw it out there and just, just unleash from the bowels of their soul. They hide in their apartment from the fucking bill collector

Speaker 9:          01:14:34       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:14:37       from their parents who live on the floor above them.

Speaker 1:          01:14:39       It's a weird thing, you know, if I can give any advice to anybody that finds themselves caught doing that, sometimes people think they can do it to celebrities because celebrities aren't really people. You know, I've seen people that like, they seem like normal folks and then, you know, they'll tell you look good or were you on? He's less blocked me from Twitter like, why'd you do that? I was fucking given her some shit about something. She blocked me on. Like, why are you doing that dude? Do you even know her? Like, what do you, what do you know? Why are you having this exchange with her? What are you doing? Why you being so mean? Why do you mean focus on yourself motherfucker? It's just, yeah,

Speaker 7:          01:15:08       it's weird when you meet those people in person too. Like there was a guy the other day that came to the comedy club and he was just like, wow, you remember that guy that came up? He was kind of drunk. And he goes, he goes, he was talking to our friend Benji and he was just like, you know, man, you suck. You're set was this stupid? Like, like, and we're just like, like interrupting our conversation. Right. And a good, it got me to the point where I was like, I almost just want to beat this guy's ass. I'm not even a fighter, but I just want to smash this dude's face. And because I've already gone through the, uh, the police, you know, just get away from iceman and leave us alone type thing. And the whole night he wouldn't leave. He kept on getting kicked out and he would come sneak his way back and start talking shit that p, uh, comics and then like, wow. It's like he just needed,

Speaker 1:          01:15:54       so he's like a, like a human in real life troll. Yes. Yeah. He was set up like an internet.

Speaker 3:          01:15:59       She was really bad at it too because he would come up with, come up to the group. He would say somebody sucked and we're just like, okay, what else? What else do you got? Oh, that's it. I just want to tell you, you suck. It's like, okay, well then that's it. Right? So you can go like, why you gotta be like that? You just told, told me I suck. What am I supposed to do? Hang out with you?

Speaker 1:          01:16:21       It's as, as time goes on, more of those people are being exposed and they're starting to feel that, you know, they're starting to feel the sting of being mean to be black. That like have you seen what happened with um, that guy that was on who's a reddit guy who was like, he, he was a posting you post like really mean evil shit on reddit and they found out who he was in real life. So they contacted his employer and he got fired. He got fired for his written and he's got like, he was talking about it like he's like, look, this is just a persona. I just do this to blow off steam. Like actually a nice guy. I've got a family. Like he just was entertaining himself by just doing this on online, you know, it gets weird, man gets weird because it's like I don't agree with that guy getting fired.

Speaker 1:          01:17:03       I'll tell you that I don't agree with the guy getting fired for something that has nothing to do with this work. Right. Because you find out that he posts mean shit on Twitter, on Twitter or on reddit. Well he didn't know that he was going to get caught. Like, you know, you have to show, you have to show that bar. You know, like most people think that the rules are pretty simple. Like it's a game to a lot of folks like try to say something mean, try to get people to react and try to get people to freak out because you put up some horrifying image and that game, the, the parameters of that game had been pre pretty clearly established. No one was losing any jobs because of that. You had an anonymous name, nobody lost any jobs. Well somewhere along the line people decided that that wasn't good enough. So they had to go after the people that were posting this fucked up shit. And the way they went after is they find out who you are as a real human being and then they go after you and that's where it's just shit gets weird because it was like, who are you? Are you your online guy or are you the real God, the real, you know, Tony Hinchcliffe that I see out there in the street or are you Tony Hinchcliffe that pretends to be a woman and a goes on cougar life

Speaker 2:          01:18:03       and tries to tries to get guys to fall in love. Have you been looking at my browser history? How many women? I mean like how many dudes out there that are online talking and they think to women are actually just other dudes that are pretending to be women. Oh yeah, that happened. No, that didn't happen to me. People are getting, well one of the things that we did on this, uh, is uh,

Speaker 1:          01:18:24       Scifi show is a, we went to a motion capture studio, um, that does a, they do the same stuff. They do Avatar and all. They did a, a lot of other movies and they have all these different frames that they can put you into. Like they put you in this motion capture suit and they make an image of your face and then they can put your face like on a body and then you're running around this area. And you're, you're running around actually like in this game, you know, you like, you could see this character and you can have, you can be a woman, you could be like a monster. You can be all these different characters in the game. How long is it until we have like a world of Warcraft type three d game and do is just decided to be a check, you know? Yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:19:08       Just because, just because it's just for fun. Why not? You know, I'm always grow up video game characters. Yeah. You would be a girl if you were a superhero, right? Didn't you say you'd be superwoman? Superwoman. And if you had the choice, if it, you know, it's, you would bother the other players more by killing them being a woman anyway. Like, Oh man, I just got killed by it. She let me give you a, for instance.

Speaker 1:          01:19:27       So let me give you what if, okay. Let's say, uh, I don't know anything about your personal situation, but it's, let's say you're in love. You found the girl, this is the one you want to marry. Okay. And you have the opportunity for one day or one hour, let's say an hour to feel what it's like for you to fuck her and she gets to feel what it's like to be you having sex with her so you, you feel what it's like to be her getting fucked by you and she feels what it's like for you to fuck her. Do you think you could do that? Do you think you could lie there and get fucked by yourself?

Speaker 2:          01:20:03       I don't think I could handle an hour. I don't think I could handle our, of what I'm dealing with. I think you could do that. Do you think you could deal with like kissing you

Speaker 1:          01:20:12       and do you think you'd love her enough to let her be you for an hour and you'd be here?

Speaker 5:          01:20:17       I really, really love myself,

Speaker 2:          01:20:19       so I'm pretty sure that if I got fucked

Speaker 5:          01:20:22       to buy me and if I was a check for an hour, I'd, I'd probably really enjoy it. I'd probably be,

Speaker 2:          01:20:29       if I was, if I was a chick, I'd probably be a squirter. Do you think you'd give up the booty? What'd you go? Anal. Would I give it if you would check taking the ass from yourself? Well, for me. Yeah. I mean from yourself. Yeah. Just spit on your head right around. Now it's you back and open it up wide for you. I don't know if I should go ask them out for yourself. That's the real question. How much do you really love yourself? Because you probably don't love yourself enough to go aft asked him mouth and yourself. But if you watch porn, girls who don't even love guys are willing to go ass to mouth, right? So consider, well, the [inaudible] are getting like 2000 bucks. So do I go for two thousand five thousand to fuck myself? If that's all it takes for you to go ask the mouth, we can have that arranged the way it has to be fucking himself. We'll just make a mask. We'll just make a mask. We'll just make a mass. It looks just like you. It's not gay if it's yourself, but we make them bass looks just like you and we put it on a girl with a strap on. So it is like you're fucking yourself.

Speaker 1:          01:21:34       Not Enough now. Definitely not. We need to actually be a girl because then you'd say, yeah, I'm, I'm not even me. I'm hurting that. You look down, you see your penis and you go, oh no, no, I'm still good

Speaker 2:          01:21:44       guy. Fuck on a game with my plane. I know I'm so confused. I don't know whether I would fuck this thing or I wouldn't. I don't know what you mean. What did they both have? Penises. Does one have a vagina? I mean I've wondered, have you ever wondered what it,

Speaker 1:          01:21:59       well, I mean, what it must be like to be a woman, to be attracted to men and to be a woman. Like how a man inside of you and to like throw the whole experience. It's so radically different. It would be really trippy if they offered up. Like say if one day your, your mind literally can be recorded. Like say if one day the memory that you experienced now is like old school, they're going to have digital memory. They're going to plug it into the cerebral cortex or wherever the fuck your memories are stored. And you're going to be able to have it on a hard drive. You're going to have to be able to have your memory in a hard drive. And I'm going to be able to take a copy of your memory or borrow your chip or whatever and sticking in my head and experience what you're experiencing. So the question becomes, if that is possible, if you can like literally one day experienced someone's memories,

Speaker 5:          01:22:43       will you experience you getting fucked by you? That's interesting because it's like, you know, people that are born wine, people that are born blind don't dream in color. I wonder if you could feel a vagina if you don't have one.

Speaker 1:          01:22:59       That's a very good point. That's a very good point. That's really interesting. I never even thought of that.

Speaker 2:          01:23:05       But uh, but you in the wife would just swap hard drives.

Speaker 5:          01:23:08       They, it seems like they're getting, it seems like they're getting a more enjoyable and I mean the noises that they make the whole time. And compared to, I mean, I don't know how you guys are, but I'm brown. I'm not that loud. It's not like, ah, I should try it. Practice. It really can go crazy. Pretend I can't wait till this is life changing advice I'm about to get. Just pretend when you

Speaker 2:          01:23:32       pretend, when you're fucking that year an animal in a movie, that's what you should do. Not even a real animal because real animals or family quiet like a squirrel. Yeah, like just a crazy wild, undiscovered ape that lives in Africa. It's one killer fucking screaming Ayp and Claude older brother neck and try it. Let's get crazy. I make sea lion noises the other time that are drying up on the beach cause they have a broken

Speaker 5:          01:24:04       good flipper. Is that how you, is that how you get the fuck dolphins by making that noise. By the way, sea lions are the most funniest sounding animal, I think. Just hanging out. I wonder what they're doing. They're communicating. I don't know. They sound so depressed and dom and

Speaker 2:          01:24:26       you ain't lying. Yeah. It's not like the best sound. Yeah. I if you ever heard an elk elk, yeah. They have this weird, we have like a bugle. It's called an elk bugle pull. Pull it up. Littler guys, a sound. It's the weirdest noise. Like animal animals have weird fucking noises, but male elks would they call bull elks when they're calling out the bitches, letting him know what's up. It's time to get some Dick Conduct. Get some deck. Listen to this sound.

Speaker 9:          01:24:59       You hear that? That's an elk. Hmm.

Speaker 2:          01:25:03       Awesome. Sounds like Tony. That's a female

Speaker 9:          01:25:07       RGT to, how weird is that

Speaker 2:          01:25:20       elk when you look at them with their giant fucking horns? Listen to that. Is that the guy that's an elk? That's an elk making noise. Yeah, that's of male. The males have horns. How crazy is that? That animals right out of Lord of the rings. Oh yeah. It looks like a boar with antlers. They're weird because they're closer related apparently to cows than they are to deer. It looks like

Speaker 10:         01:25:49       good,

Speaker 2:          01:25:50       really thick necks. Well, weird fucking, yeah,

Speaker 5:          01:25:56       I'd suck off that elk up that's made in calls or working on me. I mean, what a animal man.

Speaker 7:          01:26:04       I mean, think about that reality. Living in the woods, just trekking around in snow, looking for grass to eat. And then once a year it's time to fuck. Wow. Once a year. It's time to get your fuck on. How exciting that must be when that comes around.

Speaker 11:         01:26:20       Woo. Woo.

Speaker 7:          01:26:25       I wish I was here for the the other day that the car guy on. Oh, Matt Farah. Yeah. How was that? Oh, he'll be back again. He was awesome. He was awesome fun. We got hammered too. Oh Geez. We should about Volkswagen with them. Why? What's wrong with your Volkswagen? It's, it's the most dumbest thing ever. I've haven't had my car for a month. What's wrong? Well, when I first got it, they had this thing where the windows, you try to roll up the windows and it would roll up all the way and then it would roll down all the way and then you're like, God dammit, you have to do like four times in a row. So finally I was like, what the fuck's going on? They're like, oh, there's there, there's a recall. So they take out the windows and they scratch up. Uh, I had tenting on him.

Speaker 7:          01:27:02       They scratched up all the tinting on it. And so then I had to take it back. And then like this, uh, like a couple months later, the sun roof thing broke the trunk thing, which had like string holding up the trunk broke. Like all these little things keep, keep on breaking like the car. Awesome. But all these little stupid thing. Okay. So then I'm, I take it back. They, they, they have it for two weeks. They give it back to me. They didn't fix half the shit. So then I had to take it back out of this shit. Like, like they, they were supposed to fix this headlight thing and, and they didn't fix the headlight. And then, uh, when they were fixing the sun roof thing, they scratched up the top of the, the interiors that they have to replace the interior. And I ha, it's not like the, the general manager and the service managers won't even call me back anymore.

Speaker 7:          01:27:43       They're just this like, cause they don't have an answer. They like, they like, every time I call, I'm like, how about now? And they're like, oh, it'd be beginning of next week. Then next week comes in, they're like, Eh, it's, it's going to be the following week. And, and I, they just don't even answer my phone calls anymore. It's gotten to that point. You've got to, don't answer your phone. No, no, they won't return my calls. Like I, there was like three days that they didn't return, like return my call. And this is the dealership, this is the dealership. But I just contacted, cause I went crazy on, on Twitter. And then of course, you know Volkswagen, Twitter fit page, you know, just send me a message and what'd they say? So I called up and I made this happen to make up this whole like, you know, thing where they said the district managers just going to figure out what the fuck's going on.

Speaker 7:          01:28:23       So they had opened up a case and but still no car. And like I like they gave me, they gave me up Assad, which is I guess is a nice car at 2013 to, to use for the last two days. But it's like one of those ones where it's been stripped of everything where you don't even have like a map, you know, gene, I have like a four cylinder, like I have no pickup at all. So I'm like on the La freeway trying to like speed or do something and it's just like I have a little go cart. That's bullshit. That's crazy that they've had it for a month. Yeah. Um, what was the major issue? What the fuck was it that made the major issue? It's just that like, I mean there's been so many little things I've been broke breaking on it like the windows and stuff, but like, uh, they have net that it was over the sunroof and you pull the net.

Speaker 2:          01:29:04       What are they saying? They're giving you a reason why they can't?

Speaker 7:          01:29:07       Well, no, what they do is they fix it and they will break something else and then they break something. Yeah. Like when they fixed the roof thing, they scratched up my whole interior and so they had to replace it. They're replacing the interior now when they replaced my windows, they scratched up. But like all the tent, all my windows, when they put it back in, like it's, it's been just nonstop and then they're like all these little tiny, like, people warned me about this. I already knew this about folks on, but all these little tiny, like the cigarette lighter thing when you, where you plug in your iPhone charger, when you pull it out, the whole thing came out. So I had to get that fixed. So it's a build quality. It's a, yeah. And what's weird is if he looked back at like I get consumer reports and stuff with Volkswagen, they, they've had this problem for so long that that it's always an electrical issue. It's always, it's always, you know, like the little things break. It's never the engine. Like I usually, usually like everything runs fine. It's just like your car will fall apart and uh, it's, it's, it's like to the t

Speaker 3:          01:30:00       there and I would verbally abuse every month.

Speaker 2:          01:30:02       Yeah, it was fall. Who knows what the fuck is going on. You know, it's, I mean, it's not the every employee, well, no

Speaker 3:          01:30:10       [inaudible] the one that, the one that they put in front of you though, that's respond, whoever's responsible for that location.

Speaker 7:          01:30:15       There was also a point where apart part of this Volkswagen experience where I ordered a part, this headlight, like they were like, you know, uh, uh, something on the freeway snapped up and hit this one of the fog lights. And it was like, all right, so I have to pay for that. I understand. And they were like, well, it's going to be $200 but the labor is going to be $100. I'm like, that's fine. Just need to need it fixed. And then they didn't fix that. And then I was like, why didn't you fix this? And I had to take my car back and they're like, uh, I went to the service manager and I was like, well, you know, why didn't you fix this? And then, oh, this service guys said that you said not to fix it. That was too expensive. Okay. Well this sounds like, yeah, personal. Oh yeah. Yeah. I'm just saying it. Yeah, it's just on for everybody. Yeah. The um, yeah, that sucks. Do you want to say the name of the place? New Century Volkswagen Glendale. You can eat my dick.

Speaker 2:          01:30:59       Oh my goodness. How dare you. That's not what I was hoping you were going to do. I was hoping you were going to say do century Volkswagen Glendale. Let's work this out. Eat My dick. They have your car still. I don't care anymore. Like they say, my parents ate my deck so they might see your deck. You're going to get there. They're going to lock the doors. I'm going to go. Oh yeah, we'll talk some shit. Huh? Hey, our phone's been ringing off the hook for the past two days, so we are going to eat you. They come out with a fucking pair of hedge clippers. Chase you around the Volkswagen shop. Okay. That's in Glendale, man. Glendale's Oh, I'm fucked. I'm fucked. Don't play. You don't fuck. It does sound like a pain in the Dick though. Tony Hinchcliffe. Any car problems you want to throw into the bed? No car

Speaker 3:          01:31:41       problems. I did a, I did have some bad customer service. Uh, two weeks ago though I was at the airport. I had just gotten done with this gig. I was by myself in Corpus Christi, Texas for a weekend. I'm at the airport. I get there half hour early about to board. I mean this is the Corpus Christi airports, so there's just me and the other people that are on my flight there and I'm sitting right next to the door where they pull the gate up to you and I'm sitting right there. I have about a half hour though to wait before they load up the plane and my eyes start getting a little heavy because I have a five o'clock flight. I've been up all night. I did stand up that night so I stay up to get the flights so I can get back to la early and sleep in my bed, you know, and sleep on the plane.

Speaker 3:          01:32:21       Anyway, my eyes get heavy, I fall asleep. All their boarding this plane, I wake up, it's 15 minutes after it took off and I opened my eyes and there's still that lady that works for the airline there and I go, so that plane took off, Huh? And she's like, oh, you must be hinge cliff. I go, yeah. How do you know that? She goes, because I just paid you twice. I go, I'm sitting right here. I mean, sure I fell asleep. But you would think that this lady, there's nobody else in the airport now. She didn't.

Speaker 2:          01:32:51       So you think this was to wake you up because that what the fuck you're saying? Jesus Christ, she's blazing bitch. She's paid. They're going to fly you through the sky and a fucking metal too. You want them to wake you up to, there's, this is like 150 fucking people on this plane and enough time to wake you up. I wasn't even, it was like 35 whatever it is, 34 other people to think about why the fuck should they wake you up? There's only one guy sitting nice and wake up bench that they probably were like, Hello Sir sir. You right there? Yeah. All right. Last call. Like they're not going to come up to you and like shaking like just in case if you're not Tony Edgecliff Tony, you're a mess. That's what the fuck happened.

Speaker 1:          01:33:27       You're a goddamn mess. Wow. You couldn't even stay awake long enough to catch your flight. What are you on Ambien taking drugs on? Nice Ohio boy come over here. Phones to those La ways. Is that what happened?

Speaker 3:          01:33:38       No Man that was sitting in an airport.

Speaker 1:          01:33:43       Yeah, son of a bitch, son of a bitch. Did you see this article on a magic mushrooms repairing brain damage caused by extreme trauma? It's a, it's on my Twitter. It's a study from the University of South Florida that found that low doses of the active ingredient in magic mushrooms repairs brain damage caused by extreme trauma, offering renewed hope to millions of sufferers of PTSD or post traumatic stress disorder. And that this study confirms previous research by the Imperial College London that silicide at a naturally occurring compound present in shrooms, stimulates new brain cell growth and a races, frightening memories, mice condition to fear electric shock when hearing a noise associated with the shock simply lost their fear says Dr. Juan Sanchez Ramos who coauthored the study, a low dose of psilocybin led to overcoming fear conditioning and the freeze response associated with it faster than the group of mice on Catacid run Catan, Catan, sarin, which is a drug that counteracts the receptors that bind siliciden in the brain and a control group on amazing. It's amazing Shit, man.

Speaker 3:          01:35:00       Yeah, they, they've linked it to curing depression and, uh, other, uh, um, mental health issues as well.

Speaker 1:          01:35:07       Well, they're saying, yeah. This, this article also goes on to talk about how, um, PTSD is not just psychological, that common symptoms. It says such as hypervigilance, memory, fragmentation, flashbacks, this association, nightmares and flight or flight responses to triggers are generally thought to be psychological and therefore treatable by learning to change thought processes. But new research suggests that they may in fact be the result of longterm physiological mutations to the brain. That's interesting that it actually changes the brain and that silicide and repairs those changes. That's amazing, man. I totally believe it. I believe it too, but that's an extreme, extreme statement, you know? That's really incredible. It's really incredible that they can do that.

Speaker 3:          01:35:56       It feels like it when you're on them. Yeah. It feels like there's renewal brain growing.

Speaker 1:          01:36:02       Well, I always can see my cell. I can see life better. Yeah. I can see like, uh, I get uh, a nice path. Like, oh, there's a nice path. You go down, you know, like sometimes you get, especially if you're overwhelmed with life and busy and stressed out, you can get a little cloudy on what the path is. Totally. Then sometimes just one psychedelic experience and then you see the path like, oh, this is what's right. This is what's good. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:36:26       This is my first one in a, in a while. Uh, just a few weeks ago with Ari, we went out to Joshua tree. Oh, you were on that little journey and we had him a last and ever since then it was just like, I knew I needed, I mean, it's just like clock work. It gets rid of all that, uh, this a, I was having regularly maybe once a day for maybe only 20, 30 seconds. These feelings of, Oh, I'm dying. You know what I mean? Like this natural anxiety, like how, how am I, you know, whatever. Yeah, interested in those. It's just gone. It's just a different it cleanse. It's like giving your brain a shower is how it feels like to me. It just feels scrubbed.

Speaker 1:          01:37:05       I think it's amazing that you had that incredible experience from just dropping dairy that you had this experience of no depression. Feeling better and happier just from dropping dairy. No doubt about it. And z immediately like that day and so delicious though. But it's so delicious. Do you?

Speaker 3:          01:37:23       It is, but you'll lose the, you lose the thing for it after you don't have it. And once you see, once you feel the results directly or like Ah, I mean I love sour cream but I don't love it that much and it's easy to switch over to almond milk and uh, you know, or any kind of those things. They make so many different kinds on. I love almond milk and I never really was a big fan of regular cow's milk.

Speaker 1:          01:37:47       Yeah. Almond milks. Pretty bad ass actually. Yeah. Almond, almond milk. It tastes good and it doesn't give you that weird feeling when it's over. But it does like tastes like when you drinking

Speaker 2:          01:37:56       it and sounds like you're drinking milk but no, I can't even have fucking cereal. So it's a point Tony Hinchcliffe there's no cereals that are no non gluten per day. Probably tastes like ass. I'm sure someone's going to tell me about ones that good. I found out there's a lot of beer that you can drink. You can drink Budweiser. Budweiser has less than 20 parts per million. That's how you do judge. Whether or not something is gluten free. Budweiser and Heineken, apparently Hanukkah. So little gluten in it. The Corona, Sapporo, um, the rice beers of Japan, those, those beers are all rice beers and not, um, they're not a wheat based. Some good options. Yeah. There's some options. I'm like Heineken's always been a fan of Heinekens so, uh, that's nice. But I can't drink fucking Sam Adams and I can't drink black Butte porter. Like a thick Guinness type beer. I love, I love like those stouts about wines. You can drink wine. Sweet. Yeah. Um, I think some, some blah. I don't think, I don't know about vodka. Yeah. What about whiskeys thinking you drink whiskey? Yeah. I think you're allowed to drink whiskey because whiskey whiskey me that awry. Is that what it is? Yeah. Hmm. I don't know. Corn. I think probably Tequila. That's my scowl. Right. That's made out of like a cactus or some shit. Right? Think so. Really? That's what's killing me though. That's a great question. I never thought about it.

Speaker 5:          01:39:11       It's clear, clear, clear for something that fucks you up. That money. It seems like it should be rainbow kind of made some of the worst decisions of my life on Tequila. Ah, it's so much fun. I see. I've been doing this thing lately where I'm, I'm uh, I rotate what I drink regularly and I noticed that there's different kind of buzzes and stuff that come along with it. Totally. And, uh, now my, one of my new favorite things is just popping a shot at to Kiel and having a beer and rock in the night away where before I was very, very hung up on a, you know, a crown royal and coke like whiskey and coke was, was originally so bad for you.

Speaker 2:          01:39:50       It's made out of a Ga Bay. And uh, the blue a Gavi plant is, uh, the one where they, uh, they extract a goddess and eating man. That's fascinating. Shit. Blew a Gavi primarily in the area surrounding the city of Tequila, uh, which is west of northwest of Guadalajara in the highlands of Los Altos of the Mexican western state is of Jelly. Sko

Speaker 5:          01:40:20       does not sound safe around that. Not The place to take your family on vacation. Excellent place to be if you're a key low

Speaker 2:          01:40:32       man. It's just weird that that has become the reality of, of Mexico and just a few short decades. I mean, nobody, we didn't associate Mexico with that when I was in high school. Mexico wasn't drug war and people cutting off people's heads and the nutty shit that you see down there, it's just, it's so quick help that that's happened. Yeah. We would like to think that that could never happen us. And for the most part

Speaker 1:          01:40:54       I think you can never happen to us,

Speaker 3:          01:40:55       but Goddamn, how's it happened? There hasn't happened right there. They have the control of the, you know, when the, when the, when the mob gets big, they can, they can control the government. That's why, uh, you know, they got good, you know, good fellows and the Godfather, they did, uh, they're the ones that really pretty much ended the mob because they made it look cool and it was all about that take off. I mean, that whole, Eh, we were, I don't think we were too far away from the same type of thing. I think a difference is that the mob was, you know, it's called organized crime for a reason. They're very strategic. I'm not sure if that these drug wars going down in Mexico, they seem to be a little bit more unorthodox. They're very eager to send a message that seems to be their main thing. They will cut off heads and put them on your mailbox, you know? If you fuck with them and you know the mob, they would just put a horses head in your bed or something like that. You know? They wouldn't put up a human head on your,

Speaker 1:          01:41:50       you're romanticizing the mob. The mob, they were nice. My mom was a nice person, so she ran a few numbers, but everybody was fine. We killed the horse every now and then to keep you in line.

Speaker 3:          01:41:59       It's really interesting. They really were. They, I mean, you really think so that in a lot of ways. Yeah. I mean the city of Youngstown was booming when the mob was still, I mean, not booming, booming. The steel industry was dilapidating it, but it's better to have organized crime than disorganized crime. And what happened when the FBI raided, uh, Youngstown for example. And then, I mean that's a small, not too small, but it's a pretty small scale of what obviously would be like in New York, in Chicago. But what happened in Youngstown was a black gangs took over the bloods and the crips in, in a very, very big way. And then all of a sudden there's drive bys and there's bullets going through your window and leaving a mark on the other side of your living room wall. And it all becomes a reality. Whereas when the mob was there controlling the streets, other gangs, there was no other gangs. But as soon as they got rid of the mob, they let, they don't mind disorganized crime as much as they mind organized. It's very bizarre.

Speaker 1:          01:43:00       Yeah. That is pretty crazy. You know, that's what people say about Vegas. You know, people, they're always talking about the good old days when Vegas was run by the mob, you know, the mom just ran Vegas. Right. Everyone was polite. Everywhere you go, you've got a nice lobster. People love to talk about that. Yeah. My Brand Vegas.

Speaker 3:          01:43:17       Yeah, they did.

Speaker 1:          01:43:18       Did you see the, uh, speaking of Vegas, the, um, uh, the video with our, the, the film rather with, um, Michael Douglas and Matt Damon, or they played Liberace. Liberace slower. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:43:29       Watching it. How was it? Was it like on a, on a Brokeback mountain

Speaker 1:          01:43:33       scale is amazing. It's, it buries Brokeback mountain. Really? Yeah. Barry. Barry's it. Brokeback mountain is Brokeback mountain, first of all. I don't remember who said it. I think it was Ricky Gervais' said something really funny. I think it was him that was quoted this saying, it's surreal watching Gordon Gecko get fucked by, um, uh, Jason Bourne because, you know, Matt Damon is Jason Bourne and Gordon Gekko was Michael Douglas and you know, my 15 minutes fucking, you know, Michael Douglas show that? Yes. First of all, Michael Douglas is one of the baddest motherfuckers that ever lived. He is Liberace. I mean, he fucking is him. Wow. It's amazing. I mean, if you watch Liberace and watch the films and watch, like how he talked and behaved, I mean, he literally is him. It's amazing. The transformation is spectacular. He makes you realize what a great actor he really is. Yeah. And Matt Damon to you fucking buy it.

Speaker 1:          01:44:36       You buy it, hook, line and sinker. You know, he's Jason Bourne. Okay. You know, he was the guy from goodwill hunting, you know all those things. And yet you still buy it. Hook, line and sinker. They are too bad motherfuckers. And I went, before I saw it, I was like, how good could this bay to Jesus Christ, you're shooting your balls and waxing and oiling it up. No. Before that, in preparation for that, I don't, I don't, you know, I don't watch gay films naked anyway. The, um, the, the, the, the act again, it was incredible. The story though is really, it's kind of a weird story because all it is essentially is one guy who got pissed at Liberace, didn't want to fuck him anymore. So he told the Liberace story, you know, and the Liberace story to be told in this film is basically the Liberace liked to fuck.

Speaker 1:          01:45:25       He was really super talented. He liked to play music. Most of the old ladies came to the show, didn't know he was gay and after the show was over, he wanted to get guys and fuck them. You know, and like that's it. Like that's he and you know, painted out to be this like horrible, horrible, horrible person. But in reality, he was just a guy who had $500 million and like to fuck. Yeah. You know, I mean, it really didn't hurt anybody in the mill, kicked the guy out when the guy got crazy. But it also is interesting because the guy who Matt Damon is playing, like his character in the movie is hooked on pills and all these amphetamines and you watch like Matt Damon's character changes personality and stuff. It's fucking great, man. I love it.

Speaker 3:          01:46:06       It's amazing to see how some actors, you know, a lot of great actors and play some of the same types of characters through movies or the most impressive to me is a Walter White, um, uh, Krantz, Bryan Cranston, Bryan Cranston, because I didn't realize until like season four or five of breaking bad. I don't know if you watch it. Yeah. But he, but he also plays the dad in Malcolm in the middle. Oh yeah. Like this is positive, happy. Like who who do that? And Walter White is the complete opposite about he these. So he's got so much to him and he's not just a something that's just a little bleak character like the Malcolm in the middle of dad. He is so developed and it's so deep and sell emotional and you see so much of it that agility that

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       he could play that guy and that guy. Yeah. Andy plays that guy. So while you want me wins like every year, pretty much, uh, or at least a few now for his work on that and to think that he can play that guy too. Just a Malcolm in the Middle Dad. He's, his portrayal of a teacher is so goddamn good. I mean he, he sets the parameters of like the way a teacher would behave so perfectly and precisely. It's masterful. It really is masterful. He's incredible. They ever really is. Yeah. The guys who can do that. Like you gotta really admire that, that, that, that's just such a very, it's such a very specific level of acting. You know, like this like Daniel Day Lewis, which I harp on too much, but so that level of acting, it's so much different than most of the Douche bags you see at Starbucks going to their scripts.

Speaker 2:          01:47:38       Totally in Cranston. Such a cool guy too. I don't know if you saw this, but it comicon. Oh yeah, yeah. I just saw the thing with the mask and then uh, they brought him up for the panel and he took off the mask place went crazy. Why do I feel like we played Liberace music on this podcast before? Have we know this is what I want to pull up. Then I want to pull up the song when Liberace winks at me. Cause this is like, this was like some real shit. This is in 19, you know, fifties ish. When Liberace was like, you know, I guess this was like a scene in a movie and a woman is singing a song about how enthralled she is by Liberace. And it's, it's, it's amazing. First of all, it's amazing when you stop and think about how much our culture's changed since then because this is like, you know, whatever the hell it is. 19 we'll pull it. What does it say? What year is it? Say,

Speaker 12:         01:48:25       uh,

Speaker 2:          01:48:27       1955. 1955. Watch this shit. This is incredible. It's like strange time machine. Oh, it's just the watch this Liberace and Libby Morris,

Speaker 6:          01:48:43       she's sitting in front of her TV and she's on her knees in front of a little desk writing a letter and she's staring wistfully into the TV. Oh, Liberace plays piano. He's so handsome.

Speaker 2:          01:48:57       And he winks at you. And when he winks clinks

Speaker 9:          01:49:01       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          01:49:20       like it.

Speaker 9:          01:49:24       [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          01:49:26       so are

Speaker 9:          01:49:34       [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          01:49:44       my says Clinton that's allowed to

Speaker 1:          01:49:48       that loud clink his, his, his eyeball.

Speaker 9:          01:49:52       No.

Speaker 1:          01:50:10       How many fucking weird listening to it. I'll tell you what, man, after that movie, I went on the Liberace kicked for several days. Wow. I resisted it at first because I was like, what am I Liberace fam. Um, but, and then, but so somewhere along the line, somewhere along the line, I embrace it. And, uh, I just started just googling Liberace and listening to interviews or watched to him give a tour of his house. He had like a, it was weird. He had like, his house is like real regularly looking on the outside, but then when you went inside of it, it's like a fucking palace and he, he had like a normal front to the house but then he had like, he goes, I had two houses built inside of it. Like inside the house it just says like this fucking massive, huge place. And apparently, um, one of his houses, one of his big houses is for sale right now. I think it's palm springs. I think that's where it is. But it's for sale real cheap, like 500 grand. Like you could buy Liberace's house and it still has like the painting over the see if he could find it. Liberace's house for sale. I bet his house had a giant closet that he would say.

Speaker 1:          01:51:17       Well he sued, um, he sued a newspaper in England because they claimed that he was gay and he sued them in one apparently. Wow. Yeah, there were different times, but for reporting the reporting of that, he was a homosexual. Well today. Yeah, his mansion for sale for $529,000 which is a lot of money for that fucking house cause you never going to get it back. It probably smells like shit, dicks and shit. When he died, apparently he had like a half a billion dollars or something close to that. He was just so gangster. What he did was so crazy. He made his boyfriend get plastic surgery to look like him. So it goes back to like what we were talking about earlier. He wanted to fuck himself. Yeah. That's what he wanted. Yeah. He, he made his boyfriend's handsome guy get a chin implant to look like Liberace.

Speaker 1:          01:52:13       Wow. Handsome phrase I read that is going deep with the crazy. Yeah. That's going really, really deep with the crazy fucking a man. Yeah. A Chin implant here. Hey, get a chin implant and learn how to play the piano. Like a fucking genius dude. He didn't give a fuck. Wow. He didn't give a fuck. And he was a brilliant, brilliant fucking penis. Man. I mean, he was like a fantastic pianist. It was really, I mean, it's really amazing to watch. Did he ever date Leno and how dare you? How dare you. I'll get it to Linda has a big chin too. Oh, they're around him for years. I see how this crazy fuck works.

Speaker 1:          01:53:01       Um, did you guys hear about the unmarked graves in Florida at the reform school? Oh my God. Go back to July 31st on my Twitter. Brian, you find this story in Florida, a clash over at zooming bodies out of reform school. There's this reform school in Florida and it's called the, they're called the White House boys. And there were a group of men and many of them now in their sixties and seventies who were sent to this reform school when they were children. And they remember beatings where people were beaten to death. Where were students there were beaten to death like they had, like they ran the place with an iron fist and when kids got out of line, they gave them frightening beatings and say they knew children who died from the beating. So a few years ago, the state investigator said that they found no evidence that anyone at the staff at the school had been responsible for any student deaths.

Speaker 1:          01:53:56       But then these people, with the state's permission, they've got a team of researchers and they use ground penetrating radar to locate nearly 100 unmarked graves at the school more than a hunt. Oh yeah. So they thought it was 50 at first and then people were freaking out. And then they found, they kept finding more the state reports of the 50 boards or believed buried in unmarked graves, but said that it would not be possible to identify and zoom the remains from individual grade sites. So then they started like admitting it. And that's when forensic anthropologists, uh, Aaron, Kimberly Kimery and Aaron Kimery got invested interested in the story. So He's ground penetrating radar, found a hundred fucking bodies. And now what's interesting is that the governor does not want them fun. They don't want them zooming all these bodies. They're trying to like keep the lid on this shit.

Speaker 1:          01:54:45       They're like, Jesus Christ. So the government, the governor Scott is a fighting exhumation. But Kim Marie and her team are supported by Florida's attorney general members of the legislature and by Senator Bill Nelson. This is incredible, man. The state of Florida has the worst publicist in the world. Everything out of Florida. It's never like great, like, uh, hey, uh, great stuff discovered in Florida. No, it's either sinking into the ground, people killing each other. 100 bodies, hundred a hundred bodies, an unmarked graves. Well, they're dead. The, these people are, this is all from like the 1930s and shit. No, but like when it happened, like, like, Hey, my son never came home from school. I don't know. Hey, my, my other son didn't come home from school. I mean, I think there you're dealing with, you know, I'll probably decades of, you know, one a year missing, you know, and they've hundred fucking bodies, you know. I mean, I guess it's more than that. It means it needs to be more than one a year.

Speaker 2:          01:55:44       One every few months. I mean, how many of they kill him? And I wonder how long they were open for. That's a good question. Actually. Let's say this. Yeah, you would think somebody would be like, wait a second. There's been a hundred missing students in the last 10 years. Just what they call them, the White House boys. Ooh, this is so creepy. Just think about this group of men, many now in their sixties and seventies who were sent to this school who when they were children who knew boys that had been beaten to death. Jesus Christ. That's what, that's insane. Yeah man. Brutal, brutal beatings. Florida has a website or a Twitter account called Florida man. It's underscore Florida man at Twitter. It is maybe the best Twitter account ever. It's all shit. That dude's who live in Florida have been arrested for. I mean, and it's updated all fucking day every day and it's awesome.

Speaker 2:          01:56:41       It's awesome. Florida man tells police he has a gun so they respond to is nine one one call quicker Florida man, the cops, I'm not going anywhere until I get my weed. It's humidity, man. Humidity drives people crazy. Florida man arrested twice in one week for sex with dogs. Florida man taken to police station for driving without a license. Urinates on x ray machine. And detention officer. Florida man stops to help woman after a motorcycle crash steals her purse. Oh, I heard about that. Yeah, no, this, this woman was in a car accident. She was trapped in her SUV and uh, this guy came up and just store purse and then left her in there. Florida man leaves six year old son and crashed car because he thought his driver's license was suspended. It wasn't. Wow. Florida man crashes car three times in one night of drunk driving three times.

Speaker 2:          01:57:41       Oh Man. People are awesome. But Florida is just so strange. It's just so strange. It's so, there's a whole weird thing going on over there, man. That all swamp land. That's like the, it's like the devil's Gooch. Yeah, just swamp lands and fucking, they put Disney world there, but it's like, it doesn't seem like Disney world should be in the middle of that state. Well, you don't, they said about Florida is that within this decade, within the next 10 years, they believe that Miami's going to be underwater. It's like they're the most recent estimates. They're there. They're worried that Miami and a lot of Florida, the ground is apparently very porous and so it's not like New Orleans where you could set up a levy though. Like once that water rises, it's a wrap. Yeah. You know, so I don't know if this is right, but if that's right, think about all those giant ass condos that are like on the, on the beach in Miami.

Speaker 2:          01:58:35       Those were all what it's going to be like Venice. There'll be like Venice, Italy. It'd be way great carries in that because it's going to be no one in those things. Like what are they going to do if all that's under the ocean? Like, do you know how freaky would be if you could drive a boat through Miami and see all these, these giant buildings in 10 years? Do you think people wake up then and realize what the fuck is going on out there? They're going to have to at single, like people are gonna be like, hey man, I think maybe we should fucking stop building right on the water. What do you think? Right. I think think this water's coming up on us. Oh, it's happening. Do you see the, uh, the videos of the North Pole? That looks like a swimming pool? No, you haven't seen that? [inaudible] is fucking crazy. See if it pulled that up. North Pole melting. Wait, what do you see this? Just like, they have videos of Greenland and like these Manhattan size chunks of ice are fallen off glaciers into, into the ocean. Oh my God. It's like, it's all happening like right there. It's like you watch it every day. I wonder how long I am. Hey, I just don't even know.

Speaker 3:          01:59:38       I wonder, I wonder when like common sense and technology are going to just buttheads. Yeah. And people are just going to, they'll no longer be, eventually there's going to be no longer debates about things. You know, like, hey, is there global warming? Well here you go. Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, and just diagrams and stuff and yeah, there's a, you know, I mean it's got, it's going to get realer as technology keeps getting better at the arguments are all, yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:00:05       Hg Wells had a great quote that history is a race between education and catastrophe. Wow. A great quote. Yeah. He wrote that shit in the 18 hundreds you know, it's just shows you people saw trends. We're have crazy shit is a long time ago. It's just like we're hoping that one day it's going to get to a point where it doesn't happen anymore. It's like it's, but it seems like that's not how it goes. How it goes is just you manage the chaos as must chew as much as you can while it's around you. What is, this is supposedly a a Webcam. The melt pool. Yeah. Just slowly starts turning into a lake and this area of the North Pole. Oh Wow. Oh boy. Oh Wow. That's crazy. That is so strange.

Speaker 2:          02:01:10       While you're watching something that was completely covered in ice and then all of a sudden that melts, but we don't know if that happens every year. Right? Yeah. If it just went back to being frozen like two days later. Yeah. Maybe that was their summer. Yeah. Because you remember in March of the penguins, there's that whole thing about it thaws out and then they fuck and then they, then they go and have babies and shit and then it was freezing cold out. They have to hide the eggs. Did you ever see that now? I didn't catch that. Maybe for a great, maybe it's an interesting movie, but it's a brutal existence. These poor penguins, they have to huddle up together. The block each other from the wind. They just get together and stand up and the wind just whips them fucking 50 below zero and just, and then just trying to cover their eggs with their feet.

Speaker 2:          02:01:52       It's so primal. Wow. It's amazing when you stop and think about what kind of environment that life is not just living in but thriving year after year, year after year. These things keep fucking in that same spot. Keep making babies, keep walking miles across the ice to get to the ocean. Keeps surviving and you can plan when your Internet goes down. Yeah. Penguins. I mean they're just born in negative temperatures. This is the suckiest spot on the planet. Right? Is there a suckier spot? Would you rather live in the North Pole or in the jungle or South Pole or South Pole jungle. I live in the jungle. I don't know. It does the same shit. Both frozen. I think South poles frozen like Argentina. Like this is glaciers in Argentina. Why don't we hear anything about the South Pole? It's always the north pole because that's where Santa lives. South Santa lives in the North Pole with the fuck lives in the South Pole.

Speaker 2:          02:02:40       Is it that one article as the south port, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's creepy down there. Yeah. It's tricky. They don't even say they. Is that true? They don't even really know. Let's see. Map of the world. Was that true that the NRA, I don't know if you say to me people, Antarctica is down there. People say, um, like I've got a lot of criticism when we did the Dan Carlin podcasts. You're so ignorant for me. Is 40 years old up out some shit. Yeah. But you know what? I'm fucking honest about what I know what I don't know, man. Yeah, there's a lot of shit. I don't know, but there's a lot of shit. I do know. There's no room for all of it. Okay. God dammit, you, you can only know so many things in this life. It doesn't make you stupid because you don't know things.

Speaker 2:          02:03:22       Okay. You know, and it makes you, you're interested in other shit folks. People have to get that into your head just because there's certain data that you should have probably accumulated. But if you haven't, it doesn't mean you're stupid right now. And people are so quick to call stupid on people, but there's plenty of shit that I've done that makes me stupid. That's not one of them. Yeah. South America, it's below South America. Antarctica is essentially the South Pole. And I just signed the other day that a, we're still in the ice age. We are. Yeah. If you look up ice age, uh, it's, uh, it's, that's what we're, we're still in that cause it's a huge, you know, tens of thousands or whatever of years. And because Antarctica and the North Pole and Greenland or something like that, there's another one or Iceland or Greenland, because these things exist. We're still in the ice age until they melt that we're still in that.

Speaker 2:          02:04:13       Whoa. That's crazy. Wow. I never even thought of that. So until these frozen areas melt, yep. We're still in the ice age. So when the dinosaurs were around, there were no, no, icebergs are shut. I'm not sure about that. I don't know. I don't know whether that was in that period or not of tens of thousands of years. That's the hardest thing to wrap your head around. Yeah. That this thing changes so often. It's just constantly the, the oceans moving and changing. When I was in Montana, when we were hunting, um, one of the things that was so weird seeing seashells there, he would climb these, these tall hills, and as you're climbing up the ground is actually like silt. It's silt because that used to be the ocean. They used to be the great western inland seas. So as you're walking around, you're walking in this real mucky sort of clay ish, muddy thing, and as you're walking out, but you'll find seashells.

Speaker 2:          02:05:06       It's such a mind, fuck Joshua tree. You're looking at these rocks. Sometimes it's like a movie set because you're like, how's that a perfect circle? How's that rock perfect half. Who rolled that here? How did this get here? Will you ever see those rocks that they found? Um, I, I want to say Billy's Billy's stones. Let me say bullies. I loved that picture you in salmon that you caught that giant hug of a salmon. Your smile was ear to ear. I Laurie and I caught a bunch of them, man. Oh, you were up there with him? I didn't, yeah, Ari and I, we did a, the bear tooth, I think it's called the bear tooth lodge. It's bad ass place in Anchorage. And we uh, went salmon fishing and put those bad boys or is it we didn't need those. Yeah, because um, we, when we went it was a catch and release time, but they, they base it on how many salmon come through the we're, the weird is like a, like a salmon to have to come into this box area and they count them then they let them through.

Speaker 2:          02:06:02       But right before we got there, we couldn't have asked for a better day before we got there. There was like hundreds of salmon came through, so it was like a crazy amount. We're in the river while we were there. It was so fun. They're so big that it's weird though. Being up there and seeing moose everywhere, seeing Musen Eagles and shit. Alaska's amazing. Have you been up there yet? Not yet. You guys gotta to do a show up there. We're in talks right now about four. Five. It's supposed to be a wet two days for shows. I don't know if two days, what? Two days, four shows in our where and remember where it was now. I don't know. Fairbanks or anchorage? Anchorage. Were you going to go? Do you know the place? I don't know the place. Two days of shows. That'd be fun. You'll have a great time.

Speaker 2:          02:06:41       The people up there, coolest shit. The girl said that, uh, the girl that's booking it said that it's one of those places that they never had anybody come out there. So like if anybody comes out, everybody just goes to the show. Like no matter if they're a fan or not, they just want, you know, they find out about it because that's it. Yeah. Yeah. Well it's uh, it's an awesome town, man. There's, there's something really cool about those people up there and I think part of it is because they just, uh, it's like they're real bonded. It's a real interesting kind of a community and they're very progressive too. We saw um, uh, Christians free quality, this big group of Christians for quality. They were standing on the corner with like the gay flag, the rainbow flag, and they were, you know, like waving these signs and like waving to people and people like honk at them when they drove by like agreeing with them.

Speaker 2:          02:07:26       It was kind of interesting, you know, I didn't expect that in Alaska. I mean, I don't know prejudice word, I've never heard of that group of four. That says a lot about Alaska Christians for equality. Normally Christians are very Christian. Yeah, no, not up there, man. It was really cool. I it the, the f the shows were cool. Everything about it was cool and it's just, it just, you feel weird being up there. The fact is, any trend, how much Canada loves comedy, the farther north you go, then it must be like heaven, comedy heaven up there. Because I love the few times I've been in Canada to do comedy shows, it's always been some of the highlights. And so I can't imagine what it's like farther north. Did you Seattle? Yeah, I've done Seattle. Seattle's on fucking awesome. Yeah, they got a cool comedy scene there too.

Speaker 2:          02:08:09       You know, they have a couple of comedy clubs now. They got that, um, the parlor live to that place. It's connected to a pool hall. I just did, uh, the, uh, the Moore theater up there with Thompson girl last weekend. Oh, it's fucking so fun. Yeah. Seattle's a great place. I did that venue, I think with Jeff. Does it have like church, like a things on the walls? Like those big, yeah. Yeah. They actually just shut down to do some renovations, I think to clean it up, but it's, uh, it's amazing. Man is so fucking funny. Yeah. He's very funny. You guys gotta show tonight, right? Where are you at tonight? What time? 10 o'clock. 10 o'clock.
