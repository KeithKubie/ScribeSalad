00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This problem involves staying safe on a ship. Now let me explain the scenario to you.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The bad guys have taken over the pier, as we can tell by the flag saying "bad guys."

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
They have a cannon which they can adjust to any angle they want between zero and 180°,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and it can fire cannonballs with the velocity of 56 m/s.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Next to the cannon, there's this flagpole and it has a known height of 30 m.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Now let's say we want to keep an eye on the bad guys and make sure we know what they're up to,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but we don't want to get to within range of their cannon.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We don't want to be able to be shot by this cannon. It is not fun. So what do we need to do?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Well first, we need to calculate the range of the cannon to figure out how far this thing can shoot

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and as a hint ranges optimized from this angle is equal to 45°, but what then?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What do we do after we've calculated the range of the cannon?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Well, we need keep our distance, but how do we do that? How do we know our distance?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Well, lucky enough there is this flagpole.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
If we look from the top of this flagpole to the bottom, we can measure this angle β,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and as long as β is pretty small, let's say it's less than 10°, these are going to be

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
very close to right angles and we can do some trigonometry.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Now clearly if the boat is really close to the shore, this flag pole will look very big.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
They would be large to our observer, and if the boat is very far away they would be small.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The flagpole will look very small from faraway.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I want to know at what value of β can a cannon reach our ship.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Now this is a really tricky question.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It involves a pretty complicated 2-dimensional motion problem as

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
well as some trigonometry that we learned in the first unit.

00:01:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If you can put these all together and get the correct answer, I'll be very impressed.
