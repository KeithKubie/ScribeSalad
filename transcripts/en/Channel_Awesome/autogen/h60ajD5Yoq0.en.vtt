Jake is like this you know strange
 

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.230 align:start position:0%
Jake is like this you know strange
oddity<00:16:30.380><c> that</c><00:16:30.800><c> can</c><00:16:31.040><c> like</c><00:16:31.310><c> morph</c><00:16:31.880><c> into</c><00:16:32.060><c> whatever</c>

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
oddity that can like morph into whatever
 

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.810 align:start position:0%
oddity that can like morph into whatever
he<00:16:32.510><c> wants</c><00:16:32.900><c> but</c><00:16:33.260><c> notice</c><00:16:33.620><c> finn</c><00:16:34.040><c> handles</c><00:16:34.460><c> his</c><00:16:34.640><c> own</c>

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:56.870 align:start position:0%
it couldn't Jake just turned into a big
 

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.570 align:start position:0%
it couldn't Jake just turned into a big
ambulance<00:16:57.680><c> watching</c><00:16:58.100><c> or</c><00:16:58.220><c> something</c><00:16:58.460><c> like</c>

00:16:58.570 --> 00:16:58.580 align:start position:0%
ambulance watching or something like
 

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:01.060 align:start position:0%
ambulance watching or something like
that<00:16:58.760><c> but</c><00:16:58.910><c> I</c><00:16:58.970><c> think</c><00:16:59.090><c> Finn</c><00:16:59.510><c> knows</c><00:16:59.860><c> what</c><00:17:00.860><c> his</c>

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:01.070 align:start position:0%
that but I think Finn knows what his
 

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:03.640 align:start position:0%
that but I think Finn knows what his
mind<00:17:01.370><c> would</c><00:17:01.610><c> go</c><00:17:01.790><c> to</c><00:17:01.850><c> next</c><00:17:02.690><c> you</c><00:17:03.200><c> know</c><00:17:03.320><c> he's</c>

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:03.650 align:start position:0%
mind would go to next you know he's
 

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
mind would go to next you know he's
probably<00:17:03.830><c> gonna</c><00:17:04.160><c> turn</c><00:17:04.400><c> big</c><00:17:04.850><c> alright</c><00:17:05.420><c> so</c><00:17:05.510><c> I</c><00:17:05.570><c> had</c>

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:05.690 align:start position:0%
probably gonna turn big alright so I had
 

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
probably gonna turn big alright so I had
to<00:17:05.780><c> be</c><00:17:05.930><c> quick</c><00:17:06.290><c> I</c><00:17:06.530><c> know</c><00:17:06.650><c> he'll</c><00:17:06.890><c> probably</c><00:17:06.920><c> he</c>

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:07.490 align:start position:0%
to be quick I know he'll probably he
 

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:08.980 align:start position:0%
to be quick I know he'll probably he
uses<00:17:07.730><c> his</c><00:17:07.850><c> fists</c><00:17:08.090><c> first</c><00:17:08.330><c> so</c><00:17:08.480><c> I'll</c><00:17:08.660><c> go</c><00:17:08.870><c> around</c>

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:08.990 align:start position:0%
uses his fists first so I'll go around
 

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:10.390 align:start position:0%
uses his fists first so I'll go around
to<00:17:09.200><c> try</c><00:17:09.350><c> to</c><00:17:09.410><c> get</c><00:17:09.500><c> his</c><00:17:09.590><c> other</c><00:17:09.740><c> hand</c><00:17:09.980><c> or</c><00:17:10.130><c> his</c><00:17:10.190><c> high</c>

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
to try to get his other hand or his high
 

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.980 align:start position:0%
to try to get his other hand or his high
or<00:17:10.670><c> something</c><00:17:10.790><c> like</c><00:17:10.970><c> that</c><00:17:11.030><c> so</c><00:17:11.270><c> yeah</c><00:17:11.660><c> it</c><00:17:11.810><c> does</c>

00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:11.990 align:start position:0%
or something like that so yeah it does
 

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
or something like that so yeah it does
kind<00:17:12.140><c> of</c><00:17:12.290><c> make</c><00:17:12.440><c> sense</c><00:17:12.680><c> why</c><00:17:13.040><c> he</c><00:17:13.430><c> would</c><00:17:13.760><c> have</c><00:17:13.850><c> to</c>

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:13.970 align:start position:0%
kind of make sense why he would have to
 

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
kind of make sense why he would have to
be<00:17:14.090><c> pretty</c><00:17:14.330><c> quick</c><00:17:14.630><c> but</c><00:17:14.810><c> at</c><00:17:14.960><c> the</c><00:17:15.050><c> same</c><00:17:15.200><c> time</c>

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:15.410 align:start position:0%
be pretty quick but at the same time
 

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:17.110 align:start position:0%
be pretty quick but at the same time
yeah<00:17:16.220><c> I'm</c><00:17:16.370><c> sure</c><00:17:16.520><c> there's</c><00:17:16.700><c> never</c><00:17:16.880><c> a</c><00:17:16.970><c> point</c>

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sure there's never a point
 

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sure there's never a point
where<00:17:17.300><c> it's</c><00:17:17.420><c> like</c><00:17:17.450><c> I</c><00:17:17.690><c> want</c><00:17:18.050><c> to</c><00:17:18.200><c> kill</c><00:17:18.560><c> week</c><00:17:18.770><c> well</c>

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:18.950 align:start position:0%
where it's like I want to kill week well
 

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:20.980 align:start position:0%
where it's like I want to kill week well
no<00:17:19.100><c> I</c><00:17:19.130><c> know</c><00:17:19.280><c> thing</c><00:17:19.940><c> either</c><00:17:20.150><c> so</c><00:17:20.480><c> I</c><00:17:20.510><c> think</c><00:17:20.660><c> that</c>

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:20.990 align:start position:0%
no I know thing either so I think that
 

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:22.720 align:start position:0%
no I know thing either so I think that
probably<00:17:21.110><c> plays</c><00:17:21.410><c> a</c><00:17:21.440><c> part</c><00:17:21.770><c> oh</c><00:17:21.950><c> yeah</c><00:17:22.280><c> but</c><00:17:22.610><c> it's</c>

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:22.730 align:start position:0%
probably plays a part oh yeah but it's
 

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:23.980 align:start position:0%
probably plays a part oh yeah but it's
like<00:17:22.910><c> okay</c><00:17:23.180><c> there's</c><00:17:23.390><c> the</c><00:17:23.540><c> mud</c><00:17:23.720><c> in</c><00:17:23.840><c> the</c><00:17:23.960><c> eye</c>

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:23.990 align:start position:0%
like okay there's the mud in the eye
 

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:25.480 align:start position:0%
like okay there's the mud in the eye
that<00:17:24.530><c> works</c>

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:25.490 align:start position:0%
that works
 

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:28.060 align:start position:0%
that works
there's<00:17:25.730><c> the</c><00:17:26.060><c> biting</c><00:17:26.720><c> of</c><00:17:26.870><c> Jake</c><00:17:27.260><c> like</c><00:17:27.860><c> these</c>

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:28.070 align:start position:0%
there's the biting of Jake like these
 

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:30.190 align:start position:0%
there's the biting of Jake like these
are<00:17:28.280><c> dirty</c><00:17:28.610><c> moves</c><00:17:28.970><c> and</c><00:17:29.240><c> all</c><00:17:29.330><c> that</c><00:17:29.510><c> stuff</c><00:17:29.780><c> or</c>

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
are dirty moves and all that stuff or
 

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.340 align:start position:0%
are dirty moves and all that stuff or
cheap<00:17:30.560><c> moves</c><00:17:31.010><c> but</c><00:17:31.730><c> I</c><00:17:32.060><c> like</c><00:17:32.720><c> that</c><00:17:32.870><c> so</c><00:17:33.050><c> in</c><00:17:33.230><c> the</c>

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:33.350 align:start position:0%
cheap moves but I like that so in the
 

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:34.870 align:start position:0%
cheap moves but I like that so in the
