1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,340
We'll be able to get an a
in the store in California.

2
00:00:02,341 --> 00:00:04,290
They're trying to do that in past medical,

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,130
medical silicide been for therapy.
Yeah.

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,370
Well I had been on antidepressants since
news radio days and I'm just actually

5
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:17,670
just went off at this month, this month.
How are you feeling? Good. You look great.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,140
Good. Yeah, I'm feel very good.

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,440
And part of it was because I had this head
injury a few years ago. What happened?

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:25,200
I had a, well, I, I uh, I don't
know if you remember this.

9
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:28,700
I used to drink quite a bit. I do
remember. Do you remember that now? I, uh,

10
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,310
now I do one night,
about four years ago, uh,

11
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:36,780
I went and got really drunk or right
before Christmas and uh, wound up,

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,270
I guess at a bar called the must downtown,

13
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:43,500
right around the corner from my
apartment and I fell down on the patio,

14
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,030
just fell over like that. I would call
it our team. I would call it a dead fall.

15
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:52,110
And Linda God,
and hit my head on the,

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,320
on the stone patio with enough force that
my brain gave me a black guy from the

17
00:00:57,511 --> 00:01:00,710
inside of my, my head. It's called
cerebral hemorrhage Chevrolet. And I had,

18
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,520
I had a subdural hematoma. I was in
the ICU for four days. Get this bread.

19
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:09,490
I had one of those black right.
Red Blood eyes. Yeah. Yeah.

20
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,520
I do somewhere I think wants to
scrap. No, I get smoke tab. Oh Jesus.

21
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,770
It's all right. They can, they can, they
can get Murray though a edit this out.

22
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:22,580
Can you say it? Like total recall? You
can just remove things. But Chrissy,

23
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:27,450
you know, Christie has the
photos of all that. Uh, but,
but the weird thing was, uh,

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,220
and then I just had, it was all
right. Well, I said, all right,

25
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:31,920
I got to quit drinking and I thought,
let's, you know, it'll be hard,

26
00:01:31,921 --> 00:01:33,540
but I'll do it.
And uh,

27
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,370
and I kept waiting for it to get
hard to not drink and it never did.

28
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,280
Like I'm not four years.
I haven't had a drink.

29
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:43,830
And four years and he
was on heroin and yeah,

30
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,840
but do anything. Nothing. No Pot. No.
No. I wish I could. I don't like pot.

31
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,610
I wish I could enjoy it.
What don't you like about it?

32
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,490
And it makes me very quiet and paranoid.
That's my favorite part.

33
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,030
And that's what I like about it. Oh, but
you seem very lucid when you're on pot.

34
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,930
Yeah. It seemed very and
very communicative. Yeah.
Whereas when I had smoked pot,

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,960
I can't put a sentence together.
Yeah. It makes me friendly. Yeah.

36
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:11,520
It makes me very withdrawn. Alcohol makes
me friendly. But it's, I said for me to,

37
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,610
we say the one thing I miss about
drinking is, you know, the liking people

38
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,390
like me more. Yeah. But it's a
thing because of this brain injury.

39
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,630
It never was hard to not drink.
I,

40
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,860
my urge to drink was gone from getting
knocked in the head. Yeah. Wow. And also,

41
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,330
I noticed over the couple of years is
it, I haven't had any depression. Whoa.

42
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,000
And so, uh, just before, I guess in like
November, I said, I talked to my doctors,

43
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,880
I want to go off the antidepressants
and see what happens. And uh,

44
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,270
so I've been like gradually weaned off
and just this month took like the last

45
00:02:45,271 --> 00:02:48,840
anti depressants about a month ago.
So how long is the weaning process?

46
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,850
It's like about three months. And know
how to really addictive. Yes. Yes.

47
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,560
And how do you do it when you're weaning?

48
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:59,350
It's just gradually reducing the dosage,
the daily dosage,

49
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:04,090
and then doing it every other day and
then it's gone. But they have a protocol.

50
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,650
Yeah. Yeah. And so did he
discourage, you know, eye doctor was,

51
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:11,980
he was excited about it, so that's great.
Congratulations. Good, good. You know,

52
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:15,430
and said, but you know, keep,
keep in touch and let Israel
doctor too, right? Yeah,

53
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,510
yeah, I guess so. He had to think,
he had a reflector on his head,

54
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:23,830
that's all you need, Dr. White lab coat.
And he was like, you know, and he's like,

55
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,530
I think he lives in the neighborhood.
He's always walking around outside.

56
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,550
That's him. Yeah. That's a
doctor. So, so we did it. And uh,

57
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:34,450
and so now I'm about a month. I'm about
a month in without any antidepressants.

58
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:38,350
What is the difference?
Uh,

59
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,440
I don't really know yet. I mean it's hard.
You don't feel different agent. Uh, I,

60
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,080
I definitely, I definitely feel
more emotional. Oh. Uh, you know,

61
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:51,410
I kept crying at the Oscars.
What parts? All of it was,

62
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,100
you could have had Kevin Hart host.
Yeah,

63
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:01,870
definitely more. I think I'm more
emotional. Yeah. And uh, you know,

64
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,470
supposed to see hopefully.
I mean,

65
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,300
hopefully I'm part of what I was thinking.

66
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:09,670
I hope it will help with writing cause
I felt like I was having trouble coming

67
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:13,780
up with story ideas for things you do.
Hugged me too long now.

68
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,720
Yeah. Oh, I've always become a predator.

69
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,200
That's what it is. Yeah. But I feel good
about it. This is the important thing.

70
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:28,270
So the only thing is emotions
and you feel more creative.

71
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:30,340
You feel more in touch. I
don't know yet. I don't know.

72
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:33,670
And I don't even know if I
feel, I just know, I definitely
know that there's a, uh,

73
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,610
there's a heightened emotionalism.

74
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,530
Has it affected your improvise a little
while at, doesn't seem to have that.

75
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:44,350
I was worried it would,
I was worried that I would be like,

76
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,960
I might not be able to go out and
do those shows because I'd be more,

77
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,410
I was worried it might be more
moody and you know. Yeah. Yeah. Uh,

78
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,300
but so far hasn't, uh, effected them. Um,

79
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,690
cause I went on in news radio
cause I couldn't work at one point.

80
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:00,310
I got to the point right.
Couldn't work anymore.

81
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,210
And that's when I started going on anti
depressants and it saved me, you know,

82
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:07,660
so I totally believe it. You know, people
should get on meds and stay on them,

83
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,260
you know.
