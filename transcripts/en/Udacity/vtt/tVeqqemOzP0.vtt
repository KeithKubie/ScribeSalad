00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.350
So Carl, one thing I wanted to ask
you was, if I'm a solo entrepreneur,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.170
how would I go about finding an engineer
to help me work on these projects?

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.760
&gt;&gt; Finding an engineer can come
in a myriad of different ways.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.870
You can always place an ad on
something like Craigslist.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.400
There's the tried and true LinkedIn, or
even a site like Stack Overflow does

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.670
a really good job of
representing developers.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.470
Of course,
if you're a hackathon attendee,

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.180
maybe you'll be assigned a team mate.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.130
So, that might be just
a serendipitous meeting.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.300
Of course, you can always go
rummaging around in cafes or

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.600
coffee shops and looking for
people with laptops as well.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.260
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.040
And how would I go about choosing
an engineer if I had two, three people

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.930
answer my Craigslist ad, how would I go
about choosing who I want to work with?

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.850
&gt;&gt; Choosing who you work with is,

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.810
something I think that's dependant
on what your end goal is.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.660
If you're looking for,

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.360
maybe a web-based project, then you
want to focus on the specific skill set.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.900
So you're looking for somebody with
a background in HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.920
If you're looking to go full-fledged
mobile, maybe native experience.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.450
Then you're looking for
somebody with iOS development experience

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.132
with Objective C or Swift, or even in
branching out into Android as well,

00:01:17.132 --> 00:01:21.850
you will need somebody who has,
experience with that SDK and with Java.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.720
&gt;&gt; How would I go about
working with an engineer?

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.630
When I've found one that
I want to work with,

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.610
how do I go about actually
asking them for help?

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.575
How do I go about
getting use out of them.

00:01:32.575 --> 00:01:34.285
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:01:34.285 --> 00:01:35.075
&gt;From my perspective,

00:01:35.075 --> 00:01:39.695
I like to get involved as earlier
in the project life cycle as I can.

00:01:39.695 --> 00:01:44.615
Getting me involved means, showing me a
lot of the design work that's happening.

00:01:44.615 --> 00:01:46.255
Explaining a lot of your thinking.

00:01:47.905 --> 00:01:52.480
As your feature set is evolving
through the design process.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.630
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.730
&gt;&gt; I am going to want to understand
what you're end goals are.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.970
I'm going to want to understand what you
believe is the minimum viable product.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.230
And I'm going to want to understand
what your longer term goals are for

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.210
your project.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.920
&gt;&gt; Right, and so naturally, you would
want to be involved as early as possible

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.130
and that would be the way to get
the most use out of you, but

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.770
there's also this pull of,
if I'm the sole entrepreneur,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:13.830
I might have a limited budget.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.400
I might not be able to pay you for
the entire life of the project.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.330
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.020
&gt;&gt; So in that case,

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.030
would it make more sense to just take
you on at the end when I can actually,

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.490
just ask you to build the app and
that's all I've got money for?

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.730
&gt;&gt; Well, the app experience can be as
big or as small as you want to make it.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.240
So bringing me on at
the end would be okay, but

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.920
I think we lose a lot of the context.

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.070
A lot of the decisions that are made
through the prototyping phase,

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.520
through the design phases, I think can
inform upon how the product is built.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.155
So again.
And

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:51.255
I would want to come on a little bit
earlier in the product life cycle.

00:02:51.255 --> 00:02:55.045
Now that said,
if you do leave it towards the end,

00:02:55.045 --> 00:02:57.695
then you're going to want to
have a really well-defined spec,

00:02:57.695 --> 00:03:01.065
a really fleshed out idea
of what you want build.

00:03:01.065 --> 00:03:03.845
And then you're going to want to
be able to talk to that engineer

00:03:03.845 --> 00:03:05.085
about the budget.

00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:05.823
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:05.823 --> 00:03:08.675
&gt;&gt; You're going to want to talk about
the feature set that you're asking them

00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:09.590
to build, and

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.480
then you're also going to want to to
set some realistic delivery dates.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.250
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.930
And of course, one common thing is
if I'm an entrepreneur who doesn't

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.750
have a background in coding,
then what's going to happen is,

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.400
I might set these unrealistically.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.200
It might not occur to me
that thing X is going to

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.390
take a lot longer to build than thing Y.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.960
I might assume that they're going to
take the same amount of time and

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.080
set, give you these
delivery dates that are for

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.260
this one, totally doable and
this one, way unrealistic.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.210
&gt;&gt; Yep, and that's why I like to get
engaged to a project early on, so

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.710
that I can set some realistic
expectations as well.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.640
I do think that it's important to
involve your developers in that regards,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.050
so that we don't end up with
something like feature creep or

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.980
scope creep within the project.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.190
It's very easy to become quite enamored
with a particular interaction or

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.325
a set of screens, that maybe are not
core integral to the experience.

00:04:00.325 --> 00:04:01.130
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.180
&gt;&gt; But we believe in launching and
iterating.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.590
So, striving towards that, I mean,

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.630
viability, and then involving
the developer early on will

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.920
help you establish what that looks like,
and help you craft a plan of execution.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.660
&gt;&gt; Perfect, thank you very much.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.160
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.
