(rhythmic synthesizer music)

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.290
- Welcome to A Conversation with History.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:53.330
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.430
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.190
Our guest today is Leon Wieseltier,

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.020
who is the literary editor
of The New Republic.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.687
Leon, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:04.687 --> 00:01:05.520
- Pleasure to be here.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.050
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.440
- Brooklyn, New York.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.770
Deepest, darkest, 1952.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.940
- And looking back, how
do you think your parents

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.823
shaped your thinking about the world?

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.280
- Oh in many ways

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.244
which I'm not prepared
to talk about publicly.

00:01:20.244 --> 00:01:21.400
(Harry laughs)

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.840
They, well they were, central
fact about my parents,

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.480
the central public fact about them,

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.850
not the central private fact,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.350
though it was also a central private fact,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.190
is that they came to New York in 1947

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.920
as what we now refer to as
survivors of the Holocaust.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.190
So I was raised, you know,

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.840
in a small pocket of
Polish Jewish survivors

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.790
in South Brooklyn, and that
ramified in all sorts of ways.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.450
I have to say, it didn't,

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.420
I don't feel at all distorted
by it or glamorized by it,

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.573
and I've written about it very rarely,

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.820
very rarely, because,
well for many reasons.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.444
But it colored certain things, yeah.

00:02:03.444 --> 00:02:05.570
- And it must, as a young person,

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.240
made you very aware of history
and the course of history.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.910
- Acutely, phenomenally,
precociously aware

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.380
that everything happened
on this larger canvas.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.380
I mean one of the central
events of the modern world

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.670
ran right through my living
room when I was a boy.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.680
So there was always this feeling

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.680
that things were being played
out both small but large also.

00:02:33.134 --> 00:02:36.770
- And did this lead to a discussion

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.170
of public issues and international?

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.450
- Yeah, I'd say it did, I'd say it did.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.640
Yeah, my parents were, you know,

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.113
the newspapers were on
the table every day.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.300
My first political memory
was on my way home.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.183
I must have been four?

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.100
On my way home from the
Yeshiva of Eastern Parkway

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.680
and had to pause while
President Eisenhower drove by

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.601
to throw out the first
ball at Ebbets Field.

00:03:05.601 --> 00:03:06.434
(Harry laughs)

00:03:06.434 --> 00:03:09.470
And then a few years later I went to see

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.420
John Kennedy campaign outside
a once-famous restaurant

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.743
at a place called Kings
Highway in Brooklyn.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.810
Yeah, there was, and of course,

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.820
we lived mentally and
emotionally and historically

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.600
not just in the United
States but in Israel as well.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.620
So there was always this consciousness of

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.930
the immediate European past,

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.030
and then the American present,

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.420
and the Israeli-Middle Eastern present.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.020
There was a, so yes, our kitchen was.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.530
The kitchen was rather a global place.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.660
- Did you have a good Jewish education?

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.420
- I had a very fine Jewish education.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:45.460
- [Harry] In that.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:50.460
- I went to a very
distinguished Jewish day school,

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.660
a Zionist yeshiva sort of place

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.990
where I was instructed by real scholars

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.713
and genuine Hebraists.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.983
I had a very, very fine Jewish education.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.730
- And then your undergraduate work was?

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.263
- [Leon] Columbia, Columbia College

00:04:08.263 --> 00:04:11.590
- And there you really
were exposed to an array.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.800
- I had the richest education

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.820
in the history of Columbia, I think.

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.730
I mean I was I was obnoxiously
unappeasable about it, too.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.580
But I studied philosophy,
and I studied art history,

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.383
and I studied English.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.140
And, but I had, you know, I was born.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.700
If I'd been born five years later

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.210
I would have missed many of my teachers.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.120
I was very fortunate.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.130
Lionel Trilling and Meyer
Schapiro kind of took me in.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.030
Paul Kristeller taught me
the history of philosophy.

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.270
I mean, there were younger,
remarkable instructors, too.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.080
But I had, I was able to sit
at the feet of some great men

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.250
and then continue doing
that later in my education.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.490
I was very fortunate.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.890
- And this was a time when
Columbia really introduced

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.610
the Western civilization courses.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.090
- No, no, it was, they were already,

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.110
they were already going,

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.943
they were going.
- But they were there.

00:05:03.943 --> 00:05:06.200
- Yes, C.C., Contemporary Civilization,

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.010
and what we called Humanities,

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.187
what they now call Lit
Hum, they were still there,

00:05:10.187 --> 00:05:11.760
and they were already there.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.560
And they provided the foundation

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.283
of most of what I know, I have to say.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.670
They were extraordinary.

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.530
If I could take them again, I would.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.753
- And then you went on to Oxford.

00:05:21.753 --> 00:05:24.030
- Then I went to Oxford
to Balliol College,

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.970
where I studied philosophy,

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.370
but didn't complete a degree there

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.460
because the philosophy that
was being taught at Oxford

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.260
in those years, was in transports of logic

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.930
and philosophy of language,
philosophy of mathematics.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.290
I have neither the aptitude for
that nor the interest in it.

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.480
But had the great good fortune

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:47.480
to be taken in by Isaiah
Berlin, who became,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.430
towards whom I had filial feelings,

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.480
that we became very
close for many decades,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.487
and he had an enormous
impact upon my mind.

00:05:56.487 --> 00:05:58.000
- And then back to Harvard?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.240
- Then I went to Harvard to do

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.970
a Ph.D. in Jewish History and Religion

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.670
I'd always intended to do advanced work

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.143
in the history of Judaism,

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.340
and there was some very
fine younger scholars.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.830
Younger, I mean in their
forties and fifties at Harvard,

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.120
and I was a graduate student
there for three years,

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.540
and then at the end of
my third year was elected

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.620
to something called the
Society of Fellows at Harvard,

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.690
which freed me,

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.330
or ostensibly was just
was designed to free me,

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.793
from my Ph.D. work, though
I continued some of that.

00:06:33.298 --> 00:06:34.950
And then wrote.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.460
When I was at Oxford I
was poor as a church mouse

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.770
and began writing

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.090
for places like the New
York Review of Books

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.260
and the Times Literary Supplement,

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.410
and then when I came back
to Harvard, to the States,

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.230
to Harvard, I continued doing this.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.830
So I'd always had one foot in scholarship

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:50.980
and one foot in journalism,

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.930
which I've kind of reproduced
only on the other side now.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.230
And then wrote a little bit,

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.740
got involved in a nuclear debate,

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.550
wrote a little book about nuclear weapons

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.950
that found a great many readers.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.210
And a lot, and never
completed the scholarly book

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.520
I was going to write,
that I planned to write,

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.940
about the interpretation
of catastrophe and France

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.630
in the French and
German-Jewish communities

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.290
in the aftermath of the Crusades.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.860
But some of that material,

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.130
and certainly some of the
thoughts about that material,

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:21.730
eventually made its way into Kaddish.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.020
- And we'll talk about that in a minute,

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:28.020
but I wanna, in looking at
your very rich education,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:33.310
I gather two individuals stand out.

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.670
Trilling and Berlin, or maybe more.

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.560
- There were more, I mean, I was.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.970
Again I was very lucky.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.710
I mean Trilling had enormous impact on me.

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:44.220
Berlin did.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.623
Meyer Schapiro, the art historian, did.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.633
Absolutely extraordinary individual,

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.137
taught me how to look in some ways.

00:07:53.137 --> 00:07:58.137
- And is there a perspective that emerged

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.530
from these individuals?

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.640
I mean, I get the sense that as a result,

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:06.357
you became a liberal
in a traditional sense.

00:08:06.357 --> 00:08:08.080
- That's a big question.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.970
I guess I'd have to say the
following, many things emerged.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.890
One level, what emerged
was a lifelong devotion

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:19.487
to the humanities and a great
resistance to scientism,

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.850
either in its social scientific
or natural scientific form,

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.690
and a great skepticism
about scientific answers

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.583
to non-scientific questions.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:32.497
I also came to believe
as a consequence of,

00:08:32.497 --> 00:08:35.220
not so much anything that
was directly imparted to me,

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.520
but as a consequence of the
weather around these people,

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.270
that I became a kind of
pluralist about human life.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.070
People live in many realms,
and one must be careful

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.430
not to import categories from one realm

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:48.820
into a realm where they don't belong,

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.310
because that's how
misunderstandings begin.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:53.760
They left me with a very powerful sense

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.490
of the difference between
politics and culture

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:59.440
and of the dangers of synchronizing
politics with culture,

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:02.050
or worse, culture with politics.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:05.690
They did leave me a liberal,
but a certain kind of liberal.

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:10.173
They were all very distinguished
anti-Stalinist liberals.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.930
They were people who, I mean,

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.100
Diana Trilling had an
important impact on me

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:17.980
in this particular
aspect because by example

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.080
and through many hours of
conversation when I was young

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.800
and not very well-read and rather heady,

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.240
a student at Columbia,

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.180
she actually showed me what
it was to be anti-Stalin

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.250
and anti-McCarthy at the same time.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.540
And I've always taken that as a model,

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.810
because there's never just one threat,

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.120
and there's never just one enemy,

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.900
and there's never just one danger.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.340
And you have to operate on many fronts,

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.930
at different levels, at the same time.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:47.270
And so they were liberals,
but of a very muscular sort.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.390
They were not radicals,
they were not progressives.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:51.500
I call myself a liberal.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.490
I do not call myself a progressive.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:54.670
And my progressive friends

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.250
certainly don't call me a progressive.

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.126
Yes, so they influenced me in many ways.

00:10:00.126 --> 00:10:03.560
- And an important dimension
of the latter point

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:08.520
is what you wound up rejecting
and they rejected was

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:11.220
that there was one
totalistic view of the world.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.120
- [Leon] Yeah, yeah.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.302
- And that's what you mean by,

00:10:13.302 --> 00:10:17.460
oh, I can be against
McCarthy but not Stalin.

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.293
- Everything is not.

00:10:18.293 --> 00:10:21.530
The idea that everything is
one thing in the modern period

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.133
basically derives from Hegel.

00:10:24.565 --> 00:10:28.340
That a single spirit animates
all the manifestations

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:31.890
of human culture, all of,
all of human expression.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.380
This I was taught,

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.991
and as I began to read and
think, became clear to me,

00:10:35.991 --> 00:10:39.603
was a colossal and very
consequential error.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.070
But having said that,

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:46.880
they did also leave me with
a deep belief in reason.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.650
Not a shallow kind of
rationalism that believes

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:51.930
that the world is itself rational,

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:55.170
but a much more sober sort of
rationalism according to which

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.440
it is precisely because the
world is not a rational place

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.290
that reason is not only
possible but necessary.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.980
They were, sort of, you
know a lot of my teachers,

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.410
Trilling, Shapiro, Berlin,
and like certain other

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.300
great figures in the modern world,

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.760
Freud, and Mann, and others,

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.660
they were rationalists
who were deeply interested

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.100
in the exploration of the non-rational,

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:19.230
because they recognized

00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:22.630
what an important part
of reality non-reason is.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:26.830
And so it wasn't it wasn't
rationalism as a bubble,

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.700
it was rationalism as a struggle,

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:34.510
as a really romantic struggle
to try to expand the realm,

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:37.349
expand the boundaries
of reason in human life.

00:11:37.349 --> 00:11:40.387
- One of the ideas that
emerges in your writing

00:11:40.387 --> 00:11:42.670
and especially in your
columns and The New Republic

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:47.670
is the extent to which a
totalist view often winds up

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:50.080
not relating to reality.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.350
And it's very important, I gather for you,

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:57.210
that the ideas, you struggle
with ideas to form them,

00:11:57.210 --> 00:12:00.760
but also they have to be
juxtaposition to reality.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.620
- Yeah, I think that.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.480
You know, I don't call myself, I mean,

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.030
I'm in some ways a scholar,
in some ways a journalist,

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.110
but when asked to, as
they say, self-describe,

00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:11.620
the word I always use very
proudly is intellectual,

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.710
and what I mean by intellectual

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:18.710
is somebody who is competent
with and fluent with

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.650
the theoretical dimensions of ideas,

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.800
who genuinely cares about them.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.740
but also insists upon

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.493
taking them to the world and into battle.

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.520
You know, there are certain people,

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.130
conservatives used to have this slogan

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:34.647
based on a book that was
written in the 1940s,

00:12:34.647 --> 00:12:37.890
they used to say, ideas have consequences.

00:12:37.890 --> 00:12:39.740
Now that's true, but it occurred to me,

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:41.480
many years ago I noticed
that many of the people

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.190
who say that were usually more interested

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:45.890
in the consequences than in the ideas.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.763
And I think that one has to do both.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.730
One has to do both.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.010
One has to be genuinely committed

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:57.000
to the rigorous study of ideas,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.490
almost as if they had no
application in the world,

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:02.750
and then one has to
take them to the world.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.070
Now of course not all ideas.

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:06.830
There were some ideas that have no bearing

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:09.290
upon various issues of the day

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.080
and not everything is political.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.880
In fact one of the main lessons I learned

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.660
from my education was
to be very, very strict

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.130
about policing the
boundaries of the political,

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.960
not to let everything be politicized.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.580
And, you know, a poem is a poem.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.240
The poem is not a political program.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.710
And as an editor, I'm very
careful when pieces come in,

00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:37.070
to be sure that I edit
various kinds of pieces

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.920
in ways that are appropriate to them.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.130
A poem does not need to have an argument.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:45.083
A poem does not need to
be even completely clear.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.820
But if you're trying to persuade people

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:51.830
to vote for someone,
or to support a treaty,

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.720
or to support a war, or
not to support a war,

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.770
you damn well better be
clear and have arguments,

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:01.500
and take the arguments to the other side.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.300
- As an intellectual, I get the sense,

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.398
you talk often about patience,

00:14:07.398 --> 00:14:11.291
the patience and the
hard work that goes with.

00:14:11.291 --> 00:14:13.846
- Patients is, patience is,

00:14:13.846 --> 00:14:18.250
well, you know, it's certainly
one of the intellectual's

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:20.340
most difficult virtues.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:23.200
Patience is a difficult
virtue everywhere almost.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.500
But yes, I mean, you know,

00:14:27.139 --> 00:14:30.130
the impatient liberal becomes a radical.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:33.223
I mean, radical was a kind
of liberal impatience,

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.540
and if people who become
impatient with reform,

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:41.780
and for perfectly understandable reasons,

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.420
begin to fantasize or to plan revolution.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.500
And the question of patience

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:51.120
has to do with the difference
between reform and revolution.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.820
And it's a tricky question.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.740
It does not have an easy answer.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:58.790
There are certain questions
of first principle

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:01.650
about which a genuine
revolutionary attitude

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.900
would seem perfectly justified.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:06.810
I always, the great
debate I've had in my head

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:10.770
with myself for decades,
the test case for me,

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:12.520
is 19th century America.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.010
Is what sort of abolitionist
would I have been?

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:16.700
Would I have been a radical abolitionist

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.940
or a moderate abolitionist?

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.410
And the radical abolitionists
were calling for war.

00:15:22.410 --> 00:15:24.660
And would I have called for war?

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.493
I'm not sure.

00:15:25.493 --> 00:15:27.710
On the other hand war did come,

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.533
as a consequence in
part of that very issue.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:33.790
You know, would I've been
a moderate abolitionist

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:35.870
because actually, I did not,

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.410
I would not have wanted to sacrifice

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.610
the entirety of the American
Union to the question

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:41.270
to the issue of slavery?

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:43.130
I'd like to think that
my loyalty to the Union

00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:44.260
would have been that great,

00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.880
but the evil of slavery
was also so spectacular

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:48.860
and this is something
I go round and round.

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:49.787
There are certain questions,

00:15:49.787 --> 00:15:52.380
and the answers are not that obvious,

00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.890
they're not that obvious.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:58.230
But I try to err in the
direction of patience.

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:03.230
- So is it, what is your
view of Lincoln then?

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.380
Was he an ideal political leader

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:08.260
for mediating these problems?

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.810
- Yeah, Lincoln was a very
cunning political figure

00:16:12.938 --> 00:16:15.400
who didn't get into it to end slavery,

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.143
but intended to end slavery.

00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:21.163
- And navigated this.

00:16:21.163 --> 00:16:22.530
- Yes, it was hard.

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:27.020
I mean, what would one's
view of John Brown have been?

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.800
He was a terrorist, out-and-out,

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.900
killed innocent people in Kansas,

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.300
killed them because he
thought slavery was evil.

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:39.620
You know, good and bad
means type situation.

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.530
But those are, you know,
and I'd like to think

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:43.770
that I would have denounced John Brown.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:44.750
On the other hand, I'd like to think

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:46.810
I would not have denounced John Brown

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.530
in the way that some people
denounced John Brown,

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.730
out of a certain degree of complacency

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:56.330
or willingness to accept
this evil situation.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.950
When you say the E word, when
you when you talk about evil,

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:03.670
it triggers a certain urgency
in the discussion, obviously.

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.060
And it's hard to be patient with evil,

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.010
and probably one should
not be patient with evil,

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:13.250
but one has to be clear
about what evil is,

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:15.120
and one has to think very carefully

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.963
about how one intends to combat it.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:21.410
But the minute you find yourself fighting

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:26.340
what you regard as evil,
patience becomes very difficult

00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.730
and not necessarily a virtue.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:30.200
So these are not easy matters.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.250
I don't have a formula for them.

00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:37.650
- We'll pick up this thought in a minute,

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:40.550
but I wanna go back to
your formative experience,

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:43.530
because one part of your
formative experience

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:46.700
comes later in your life with the writing

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.363
of the book Kaddish, which.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:56.300
Tell us about what your goal
was there in writing that book.

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.730
Your father has passed away and you assume

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:03.370
the responsibility of saying
Kaddish for him for a year.

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:06.173
- The immediate goal was as, look.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.560
I was raised as an Orthodox Jew,

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.010
but I did not live as an Orthodox
Jew for many, many years.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.510
But even when I was not living in that way

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.680
I knew that when the time would come

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.680
to do my duty as a mourner, I would do it,

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:26.310
because it's what my father
expected of me his whole life.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.130
And it was not a question.

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.370
I mean, it was, so I began to do it,

00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:31.350
and when I began to do it,

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:36.060
to do it means to appear in
synagogues three times a day

00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:37.610
to utter this prayer

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:41.743
that says nothing about
mourning or death or pain,

00:18:43.672 --> 00:18:46.263
it just is a series of praises of God.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.570
They call it doxology.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.940
And I began to do it,
and I began to understand

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.640
that I didn't know quite what I was doing.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:59.210
And I decided I wanted to
find out what I was doing,

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.160
even though I intended to do it anyway.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.800
You know, and this is true,
by the way, this was not as.

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.480
This is a melodramatic example,

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.280
but in fact it's usually the case in life

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.310
that we are already doing the actions

00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.310
for which we are seeking reasons.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:16.170
I mean, there is no
timeout that allows one

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:19.750
to figure out the reasons
for what one intends to do

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:21.570
and plan how one intends to live,

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:24.600
and then proceed and act on
this very well-reasoned plan.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.240
That's not what life is like.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.280
You find yourself performing
certain practices,

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.790
living according to certain
customs, religious, secular,

00:19:31.790 --> 00:19:34.800
I mean all kinds, and you
begin to seek reasons for them.

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:36.010
And if you don't find reasons,

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:38.820
some of them you reject
and you stop practicing.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.920
Though, some of them,
you have an attachment to

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:43.920
for non-rational reasons.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.030
You have a love for them,

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:48.230
you believe they have a
positive, practical utility,

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:50.450
and so your failure to
find a reason for them

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:53.160
doesn't yet dissuade you
from practicing them,

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.170
and you keep looking for the reasons.

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:56.900
And others you find reasons for,

00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.423
and it all works out in that way.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.950
I mean, the whole relationship
of belief to action

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:05.360
works out neatly that way.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.350
In this case I actually
set out to find out

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:10.410
what this prayer was, what
this custom was, and so on.

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:14.780
And not surprisingly, it
turned into an investigation

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.623
of some primary questions
about human existence.

00:20:20.203 --> 00:20:21.980
I'm a very bookish man.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.030
And whenever I'm perplexed or in trouble,

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:27.453
my tendency is to go to the bookshelf.

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.640
I began to go to my bookshelf,

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.860
which I have a very
considerable Jewish library,

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.210
to find medieval and ancient
texts to translate them

00:20:37.210 --> 00:20:39.970
into English just for my own pleasure.

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:42.890
It wasn't until five or six
months into this 12-month period

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.130
that I even knew that
I was writing a book.

00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:47.800
I was doing this to
make sense of it for me,

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.580
and if something came out of it

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.030
to be useful to other people.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:53.610
Then about five or six months into it,

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:56.150
I realized that I was
writing a scholarly work

00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:00.180
about the origins of this
Jewish custom of mourning,

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:03.700
a philosophical work
about death and mortality,

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.180
and a kind of spiritual journal.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:10.610
And I began it, and the
genres became all mixed up.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.200
And when I was writing it, I
had some anxieties about that.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.280
I was like, what is it?

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.820
And then, as writers
discover when they're writing

00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:20.760
something that has some inner necessity,

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:21.810
that was the key thing for me,

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:23.960
it's key thing for me
about any book or movie,

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.730
that it have some inner necessity,

00:21:25.730 --> 00:21:27.750
when something has this inner necessity,

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:29.040
the questions of the genres,

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.210
all those external questions, fall away.

00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:32.563
It is what it is.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.601
The first couple of months
after my father's death,

00:21:37.601 --> 00:21:40.510
I was smashed up emotionally,

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:44.020
and I was living this somnambulistic life,

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.180
getting up at these ungodly
hours to get to shul and so on.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.040
So I wrote it in about 10 months,

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.730
and then permitted myself
the other two months

00:21:51.730 --> 00:21:54.530
of the 12-month period
after the period was done

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:56.300
to kind of clean it up.

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:59.340
But it is it was written in real time.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:00.793
It was written in real time.

00:22:02.859 --> 00:22:07.180
At the very last minute, I
cut out about 40 or 50 pages

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:08.620
about my father and myself,

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:12.450
because I didn't want
the book to be mistaken

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:16.940
for another melodramatic
confessional about a boy,

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.333
a man and his dad.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.830
This is not a psychological book.

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:23.743
I don't have much interest in psychology.

00:22:23.743 --> 00:22:28.743
- So really, you were practicing
the work of being a scholar

00:22:29.327 --> 00:22:34.327
and an intellectual as
part of a responsibility

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.970
that dictated by your
faith and your relationship

00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:39.803
to your father.
- Yeah.

00:22:39.803 --> 00:22:40.760
I have always believed

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.470
that study is a primary
spiritual expression.

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:47.360
And in the Jewish tradition,
it certainly is that.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.440
And it was always my
primary religious expression

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:53.590
because, as I say, in terms
of behavior I was lapsed,

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:55.760
and I was always very bad at prayer,

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:58.233
for a whole variety of
philosophical reasons.

00:22:59.688 --> 00:23:04.130
So study was, was my path, as it were.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.440
And it was also, it was
temperamentally suited for me.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:12.440
So yeah, I was a mourner,
scholar, thinker, diarist.

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:16.343
That's what I was doing.

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:20.570
- And you write that what you learned,

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:22.510
and I'm not saying this is
the only thing you learned,

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:27.390
that scripture and study
were the original occasion

00:23:27.390 --> 00:23:29.210
for Kaddish, not mourning.

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:32.810
- Yeah, yeah, I mean, just as
a purely historical matter.

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:37.340
The Kaddish originated in
the Talmudical academies

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:42.340
in the Middle East, in what is now Iraq,

00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.220
in the early medieval centuries.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.660
And they are, the Kaddish,
as I said, is just,

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:52.660
it's a series of praises of
God, and it's in Aramaic.

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:01.120
This passage was used as
a kind of structural unit

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.200
to separate various aspects of the prayer

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.683
and to conclude study.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.320
The earliest Kaddish we have,

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.090
at the end of any study
of Torah or Talmud,

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:12.440
there would be this prayer.

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:17.110
Now that particular Kaddish
actually refers to students

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:19.250
and the students of students and teachers,

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:21.260
and it's quite clear that

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.320
that is a kind of peroration after study.

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.840
A shorter version of it
became adapted to the liturgy,

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.603
just as a structural unit,
just as a kind of, you know,

00:24:33.301 --> 00:24:35.028
as the ginger in the
sushI between the bites.

00:24:35.028 --> 00:24:37.280
(Harry laughs)

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.020
And one of those structural
units then was adapted

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:41.790
for the purposes of mourning.

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:45.130
And that was the riddle for me, is why?

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:45.963
Why?

00:24:45.963 --> 00:24:48.490
And that's what I set out to figure out.

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:50.460
Where and when it originated,

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:53.710
which I'm pretty satisfied I discovered.

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:56.903
And then, what it meant,
and then what it meant.

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:00.320
And that, what it meant,

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.420
involved getting into many, many sources

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.460
about the relationship
of parents to children

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:09.690
and the whole question of filial duty,

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.830
of parental responsibility, and so on.

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:17.830
- How did this exercise
affect you in your later life?

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:24.090
I mean, did it prove something to you

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:28.260
about what you wanted to do thereafter?

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.963
- No, I have to say.

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.063
You know the when the book appeared,

00:25:36.852 --> 00:25:40.323
its reception was deeply
satisfying and somewhat surprising.

00:25:40.323 --> 00:25:41.605
- [Harry] And it was nominated for a.

00:25:41.605 --> 00:25:42.438
- It was nominated for
all kinds of things.

00:25:42.438 --> 00:25:44.793
It won things, that stuff
doesn't interest me.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:51.050
But certain things were said.

00:25:51.050 --> 00:25:54.690
There was a certain traditional
Jewish response to it

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:56.250
that basically portrayed me

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:58.333
as the prodigal son who'd come back.

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.160
My response to that was always, look,

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.367
actually I never really
left as you think I did,

00:26:03.367 --> 00:26:05.757
and I'm not quite as
back as you think I am.

00:26:05.757 --> 00:26:07.290
(Harry chuckles)

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:10.260
Then there were those who thought

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:14.420
that it represented some
transformation in me.

00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:15.430
That was incorrect.

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:16.670
In fact, Harold Bloom,

00:26:16.670 --> 00:26:20.000
in a very favorable review of the book,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.943
though not a very penetrating one,

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:26.680
he complained that the protagonist
of this book, the hero,

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.700
didn't change, didn't
undergo any transformation

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:32.750
in the way that heroes are supposed to.

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.120
And he was right.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:34.953
I didn't.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:40.110
I have to say, you know,
it took me decades,

00:26:40.110 --> 00:26:42.930
but after much study and much thought,

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.970
I'd arrived at what I regarded

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.900
as a defensible picture of the world.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:52.453
And before my father died
I knew that parents die,

00:26:54.037 --> 00:26:58.510
Before I saw death, I
knew that death existed.

00:26:58.510 --> 00:26:59.790
If you're a student of philosophy,

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.520
you've been studying these
questions long before

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.540
you've had occasion to experience them.

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.450
So no, this was more, it turned out to be,

00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:09.280
and for this I was grateful,
it turned out to be

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:12.510
an opportunity for me to record

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:15.210
some of my understandings
of these questions,

00:27:15.210 --> 00:27:20.083
but my life was not changed in that way.

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:23.320
- But was there a catharsis?

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.700
- There was a catharsis, certainly,

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:28.243
but the catharsis was in, I mean,

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:33.050
there was the filial catharsis,
the personal catharsis,

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.810
which came in the form of mourning.

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.420
I mean it was, you know, I mean,

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.903
life was suspended in some way for a year.

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:43.660
At first completely suspended,

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:45.150
then as the year wears on,

00:27:45.150 --> 00:27:47.030
increasingly less and less suspended,

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:49.470
but still the mourner is, in Jewish law,

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:53.170
kind of pariah, does not
participate completely

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:55.430
in the society, in the community.

00:27:55.430 --> 00:28:00.210
And it was a catharsis in
that I had managed to produce

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:05.210
what I regarded as a
satisfactory representation

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.580
of my views of certain things,

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.650
and to write a certain kind of book.

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:12.270
I mean, I have to say,
you know, I earn my living

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:13.780
as a certain kind of journalist.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:17.560
I'm not, intellectually I'm
not primarily a journalist.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.340
I've never reported on anything.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:24.247
I don't regard the telephone
as an instrument of research.

00:28:24.247 --> 00:28:25.080
(Harry laughs)

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:25.973
Never have.

00:28:27.675 --> 00:28:31.200
I'm not that, so I'm not, I'm
not that sort of journalist.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.650
- But you are a diarists,
that's what your column.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:33.900
- Well, yeah, I'm a diarist.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.303
But my diarist is,

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:37.855
it's a kind of (speaking
in foreign language).

00:28:37.855 --> 00:28:42.010
It's a kind of old-fashioned,
late 19th century,

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:44.290
or 20th century European page

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:47.780
in which one writes about
anything one wants to write about

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.660
but in which one writes about them

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.370
with some learning and a certain amount

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:53.203
of philosophical resonance.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.480
You know, I read the
polls about the election,

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.720
but I'm not going to write about them.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.160
Everybody else is.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:04.130
- You written about Jewish literacy

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:09.130
as a cultural problem for the
Jews in the United States.

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.240
You were not illiterate.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.357
You were clearly steeped in lit,

00:29:15.357 --> 00:29:17.160
and that made it quite a difference.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.613
- As a Jew, I live mainly in Hebrew.

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.720
As a non-Jew, which I am too.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.170
I mean there's the goy in me.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:26.500
I live in English.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.360
I live doubly.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.930
I've always believed in living doubly

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:30.700
or tripling or quadruply.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.720
Again, I told you, I'd, you
know, we live in many realms.

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.454
People who believe that
that human identity

00:29:37.454 --> 00:29:41.780
must be seamlessly sewn
together so that it all adds up

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.270
into one brilliant and beautiful package.

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:45.600
I think that's an illusion.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.610
I think it's a great
simplification of life.

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:51.400
So yes, I live doubly, and as a Jew,

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:55.860
I do most of my living in
Hebrew, with great pleasure,

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.683
because that's the natural,

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.050
that's the natural weather for Judaism.

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:03.263
I mean a language is your air,

00:30:03.263 --> 00:30:06.080
and Judaism had a variety of languages,

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.930
but it's central language is Hebrew.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:10.330
It doesn't happen in English.

00:30:10.330 --> 00:30:12.850
And yes, I've written about it sometime,

00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:16.930
but what I've done is
I've traveled the country,

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:20.893
far and wide, like an itinerant
fire and brimstone preacher,

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.330
just castigating Jews
for how little they know

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:25.223
in this regard.

00:30:29.810 --> 00:30:34.440
- Does this problem
relate to Jewish attitudes

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.860
toward Israel.

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:36.828
- [Leon] No.

00:30:36.828 --> 00:30:39.350
- That is understanding the
politics of that country.

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:40.183
- No
- No.

00:30:40.183 --> 00:30:43.840
- No, early on in Israel's
history in the '50s and '60s

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.900
there was a certain American-Jewish
enthusiasm for Israel,

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.550
a certain American-Jewish Zionism

00:30:51.308 --> 00:30:52.837
that impelled people to go learn Hebrew,

00:30:52.837 --> 00:30:54.970
and there were these institutions

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:56.400
called (speaking in foreign language)

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.900
that were basically Hebrew
classes taught by Israelis.

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:02.090
And there was that period,
but that period passed.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:05.800
And now, of course, most
Israelis prefer to speak English

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.050
with their American-Jewish brethren.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:10.500
And you know, I've thought for years

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.320
that the day that Haaretz posted

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.540
a daily English translation
of its newspaper,

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.777
it practically doomed the fate of Hebrew,

00:31:18.777 --> 00:31:21.250
and it doomed Hebrew in the
American-Jewish community.

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:25.380
No, Israel is not why
American Jews need Hebrew

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:26.380
or should know Hebrew.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.120
Judaism is why they should know Hebrew.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.130
They should know their civilization,

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:36.130
- Now you've written things
about the Israeli government

00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:38.291
that separates.

00:31:38.291 --> 00:31:39.124
- [Leon] I have.

00:31:39.124 --> 00:31:41.900
- That criticism, criticism that you make,

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.040
from support of Israel.

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:47.570
Is this a subtle distinction

00:31:47.570 --> 00:31:50.420
that escapes the Jewish community?

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.810
I mean, that is the notion.

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:53.200
- I think it escapes lots of people.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.740
Again, we get back to this question

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:58.100
of living or thinking doubly.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.950
I think that Israel has mortal enemies

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:05.563
and needs to defend itself ferociously.

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:11.440
And I think that unless the
Palestinians get a state,

00:32:11.550 --> 00:32:13.620
the Jewish state will not survive,

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:18.620
and that Israel has been
unconscionably delinquent

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:22.680
in pursuing a solution
with the Palestinians.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.950
Not just this government,
some former governments too,

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:27.240
but especially this government.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:30.550
And I've insisted that one has
to speak both these thoughts

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:33.133
in the same breath and
think them at the same time.

00:32:34.010 --> 00:32:36.250
And that it is not the case

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:38.570
that if if there should be it,

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:40.710
that because there should
be a two-state solution,

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:44.120
we need not worry about the
Iranian nuclear capability.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.490
And it is not the case that
because the Iranians may want

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:48.110
to acquire a nuclear weapon

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:49.810
that the Israelis don't have to worry

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:52.053
to find a solution with the Palestinians.

00:32:53.100 --> 00:32:54.080
People have got to learn

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.560
to do a bunch of things at the same time.

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.750
Now, each camp ideologically
in the Jewish world,

00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:01.710
in the IsraelI political world, prefers.

00:33:01.710 --> 00:33:03.360
They have their preferred threat,

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.020
and some of that, I say that,

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.980
that's a little more cynical
than I mean it to sound.

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:10.020
They may actually sincerely have arrived

00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:12.900
at the conclusion that there
is one overwhelming threat.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:14.410
I don't see one overwhelming threat.

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:16.820
I see a variety of very serious threats.

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.810
And they all have to be addressed.

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:22.220
And I see nothing incompatible
with a robust response

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.350
to the Iranian attempt to
acquire a nuclear weapon.

00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:27.260
And we can discuss what a robust
response means if you want.

00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:31.400
And a robust attempt to
find a way to establish

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:34.110
the state of Palestine
alongside the State of Israel.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:36.500
I'm an old Peace Now guy.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.710
I've always thought that the
only solution to this problem

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:40.740
are two states.

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:42.190
It was always the only solution.

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:43.833
It used to be called partition.

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:46.320
It's the same idea.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.500
Both peoples have the rights to the land.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.555
Neither people can have the whole land.

00:33:50.555 --> 00:33:52.870
Neither people who's leaving the land,

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:54.770
both peoples have to live in peace.

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:57.270
The only, the only solution
is to divide the land.

00:33:58.210 --> 00:33:59.110
I mean, that's since

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.810
the Peel Commission proposed it in 1936.

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:03.180
That seems to have been the only morally

00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.320
and practically sound solution.

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.470
And somehow, we cannot get there.

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:09.810
- So what does a robust response

00:34:09.810 --> 00:34:11.570
to the Iranian challenge?

00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:16.570
- I am very, I have dark
thoughts about this subject.

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:21.113
Not dark thoughts of the
sort you might think.

00:34:22.963 --> 00:34:24.710
I'm not persuaded

00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:28.500
that there is any military
solution to this problem.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.310
I do not believe that the
Israelis can have 'em,

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:33.313
can provide a military solution to it.

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:37.980
The Israelis, I think,
understand that, that they can't.

00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.630
I don't think they any
longer believe that,

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:41.970
which explains some of Netanyahu's

00:34:41.970 --> 00:34:44.893
otherwise inexplicable behavior
in the last six months.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:48.730
And the question is first,

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:51.380
does the United States have the capability

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.010
to provide a military
solution to this problem?

00:34:54.010 --> 00:34:56.390
And B, would the United States be willing,

00:34:56.390 --> 00:34:59.170
or should the United States
be willing to do this?

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:01.403
And one can have many answers to this.

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:06.630
The only solution to the
Iranian nuclear question

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:09.483
is democratic change in Iran.

00:35:11.070 --> 00:35:12.610
I've no doubt about that.

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.980
Problem is that the
democracy clock is ticking

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.043
much more slowly than the nuclear clock.

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:20.620
If there is a military
strike against Iran,

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:22.730
I imagine they can cripple the facilities

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:23.610
for two or three years.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:25.370
They can set it back.

00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:26.900
I then imagine that the next morning,

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:28.770
the Iranians will start to dig more deeply

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:30.083
into a different mountain.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.660
There will be no damage assessment.

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:35.350
We won't know what we've accomplished.

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:38.830
I don't worry about the
response in the region

00:35:38.830 --> 00:35:39.663
in the sense that I think

00:35:39.663 --> 00:35:42.400
the Iranians would unleash
Hezbollah against Israel,

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:46.100
which would be, there
would be another war there,

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.470
and I'm not taking that lightly,

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:50.570
though the IsraelI army's
kind of itching to get there,

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:52.400
to destroy that arsenal,

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.650
But I believe that any attempt by anybody

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:58.230
to setback or destroy the
Iranian nuclear program

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:01.050
would be welcomed joyously by the Saudis

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:04.843
and the Gulf states and Egypt and so on.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:08.460
But, so, I don't really
have a solution to this

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:11.990
in the sense that I'm
increasingly not of the belief

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:13.773
that there is a military solution.

00:36:14.861 --> 00:36:19.250
- You've written about the Arab Spring

00:36:19.250 --> 00:36:24.250
as someone who, in
looking at his principles,

00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:27.916
leans on the side of
humanitarian intervention.

00:36:27.916 --> 00:36:28.749
- [Leon] Absolutely.

00:36:28.749 --> 00:36:33.749
- And I wanna explore that
because it it may be a place

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:36.630
to test this idea of having principles

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:38.850
but relating them to reality.

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:43.850
So I would be interested in
in your intellectual struggle

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.500
to come to the conclusion you come.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.130
You've been very critical

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:49.900
of the Obama administration,
- I have.

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:54.280
- on Syria, but supportive
of their action in Libya.

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:55.113
- Absolutely.

00:36:55.113 --> 00:36:59.060
I think that the Arab Spring
is the most strategically,

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:03.983
historically important event
since 1988, '88, '89 in Europe.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:09.530
I think that the possibility
of political progress

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:11.720
and social progress in the Arab world,

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.163
its ramifications are so far-reaching,

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:16.823
that it must be supported.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:21.080
I think that having said that,

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:23.210
one must understand that democratization

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:26.170
is a very difficult and brutal process.

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:27.900
That it is a process,

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:30.873
That democratization is
not an event, it's an era.

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.700
And you have to keep your head,

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:36.160
because it doesn't happen
in a day or a week.

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:37.240
When you liberate people,

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:39.600
you liberate the actually existing people

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:42.740
who may merely wish to be free

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:45.433
to return to some of their
old autocratic prejudices.

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:51.850
The turmoil, the confusion,
the relative success so far

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:57.150
of certain Islamist forces
doesn't surprise me.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:59.980
It worries me, of course,
but it doesn't surprise me.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:02.480
The blame for the rise
of these Islamist forces

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:05.290
is not the democratic
revolution, its Mubarak.

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:08.930
The dictators are responsible
for the rise of the Islamists,

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:11.660
because the Islamists
are all that was left

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.570
after the dictators

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:15.963
gutted their society of all its politics.

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:21.443
Morsi is the direct result of
Mubarak, not of Tahrir Square.

00:38:23.570 --> 00:38:25.960
So I think that these must be supported.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:26.820
I think the United States

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:30.720
should support democratic
stirrings and revolts

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:33.473
just about everywhere,
just about everywhere.

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:36.710
I think Obama did not support it

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:38.320
adequately or in time in Egypt.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.120
Finally came around.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.450
I think liberty intervention in Libya

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:44.363
was the right thing to do.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:48.770
I think that our failure to intervene,

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:52.400
and I don't mean by invading,
but to intervene in Syria.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:57.400
is an act of such stupidity
and moral callousness.

00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.620
It reminds me of what it was
like in the first 2 1/2 years

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:02.183
of the Bosnian genocide.

00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.653
It took Clinton 2 1/2
years to go in and stop it.

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:07.740
And by the time he stopped it,

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.470
a quarter of a million
people had been killed

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:13.410
Everything, everything that
Obama said would happen

00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:15.960
if we intervened is
happening because we didn't.

00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.380
Everything.

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.420
It is now a sectarian civil war,

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.960
there are jihadi elements
that are arriving in Syria.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.130
It is destabilizing the region.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:27.870
It is spilling over into Turkey,

00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:29.543
it is spilling over into Jordan,

00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:33.980
it is spilling over spectacularly

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:35.423
last week into Lebanon.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:38.080
Everything that was supposed to happen

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.810
as a result of our
intervention is happening

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:41.310
because the West did nothing.

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:43.150
We are just watching it.

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:46.170
And he intones these
high-minded statements

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:49.030
that are, sound more and more cynical.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:52.040
As far as I can tell, he
has absolutely no intention.

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:52.873
- Obama.

00:39:52.873 --> 00:39:54.040
- Obama.
- Obama.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.140
- The moral argument for intervening

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:58.720
seems pretty clear to me.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.880
This man is massacring his people.

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.170
I mean, he's massacring children.

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:03.950
The massacre of children,

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:06.610
it has played an especially central role

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:08.540
in the Syrian rebellion,

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.230
in the way that the rape
of women did in Bosnia.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:14.410
It was sort of that extra
touch of evil as an instrument,

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:17.373
and that extra instrument of war.

00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:19.850
But there's not only a moral argument,

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:21.260
there's a strategic argument,

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:23.770
which is that, and the
strategic stakes in Syria

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:26.770
are much higher than they
were in Libya, much higher.

00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:28.350
And the fall of the Assad regime

00:40:28.350 --> 00:40:32.660
would deliver a body blow
to the Iranian government

00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:34.340
to the regime in Tehran,

00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.380
and nothing is more in
the strategic interest

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.140
of the United States in that region

00:40:38.140 --> 00:40:39.450
than to weaken, and cripple,

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:43.600
and ultimately to see
replaced the regime in Tehran.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:47.040
- On this issue, a realist might say,

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.060
and I want you to respond
to this criticism,

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:52.830
that you're not showing the patience

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:57.830
that is Obama's virtue in in this process.

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.610
- But remember I said earlier
that there are certain,

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:02.320
there are certain events or certain things

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:05.810
that again, the patience
question is complicated.

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:09.120
Showing patience in a
humanitarian emergency

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.350
represents a fundamental misunderstanding

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:13.420
of the nature of the emergency.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:16.360
If the problem is that innocent
men, women, and children

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.410
are being massacred, then if
you don't stop it immediately,

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.520
you've misunderstood the problem here.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:24.720
You don't take your time
stopping a massacre.

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:27.270
Again, to use the
imperfect medical analogy,

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:29.270
if you discover that you
have a tumor that needs

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:31.790
immediate, dramatic treatment,

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:34.160
you don't escalate, you nuke it.

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.970
Which is why people get
rushed to the hospital

00:41:36.970 --> 00:41:38.600
and their lives change overnight.

00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.980
Because the only meaningful response,

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:42.630
the only effective response,

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:45.930
is an immediate response
and a significant response.

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:49.023
So I think it, when it comes
to the stopping of atrocities,

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.510
conferences and escalation and,

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:53.990
it is the opposite.

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:55.623
It is actually a way of,

00:41:57.770 --> 00:42:00.260
that form of doing
something is the worst way

00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:01.390
of doing nothing.

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:04.380
But, again, if you want to talk about it

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:07.400
from a cold-hearted,
realistic perspective,

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.320
just look at the map.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:14.320
The overthrow of Assad would
be devastating to Iran,

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:18.553
devastating to Hezbollah,
devastating to Russia.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:24.660
Strategically, these are all
goods for the United States.

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:25.853
These are all goods.

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:30.460
I don't see, I don't see that now is.

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:33.550
The argument, the realists
say, but there will be chaos.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:36.280
To which I respond, but there is chaos.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.600
There already is chaos.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.190
And the reason there's chaos
is because we've been passive.

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:42.370
One of the reasons, you know.

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:43.370
There is chaos.

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:45.980
They say it will be an
ethnic sectarian war.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.660
It is an ethnic sectarian war.

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:51.630
It wasn't a year ago,
it wasn't a year ago.

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:55.900
So I think that our policy
on Syria has been disastrous

00:42:55.900 --> 00:43:00.900
and should disqualify
Obama from dining out

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:03.560
on the Libyan example any further.

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.220
- You actually believe

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:10.220
that humanitarian
internationalism is a way,

00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:13.023
one of the great contributions
of the United States.

00:43:13.023 --> 00:43:15.620
- I think that American
power can be used for good

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:16.850
and should be used for good.

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:17.683
- [Harry] Yeah.

00:43:17.683 --> 00:43:18.980
- I think the fact that
it's been used for ill

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.280
does not mean that can
never be used for good.

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:24.020
You know, but again,

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:27.850
I believe that one has to judge each case.

00:43:27.850 --> 00:43:31.040
I supported the Iraq
war because I believed.

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.140
I believed what I was told,

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.270
that there are weapons of
mass destruction there,

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:35.210
and more to the point,

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:37.870
because Saddam Hussein
had already used them.

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:40.840
The important fact about
Saddam Hussein was Halabja,

00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:43.314
was the chemical warfare
against his own people.

00:43:43.314 --> 00:43:45.040
- [Harry] The Kurds.
- The Kurds.

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.340
But they were Iraqi Kurds.

00:43:49.379 --> 00:43:50.790
And I thought, I don't have to speculate

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:52.620
about the willingness
of this man to use them.

00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:54.210
He's already shown that he can.

00:43:54.210 --> 00:43:55.440
When it became clear to me

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:57.150
that there were no weapons
of mass destruction,

00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:59.260
I recanted my support immediately,

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:01.460
though I did say that my feelings

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.500
about the origins of the war,

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:06.650
it shed no light on what the
outcome of the war might be,

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:09.190
and that Iraq without Saddam Hussein,

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:11.590
with this groping towards

00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:13.610
some sort of parliamentary, open system,

00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:16.290
will be, may turn out to be a blessing.

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:18.870
But if I'd known there were no
weapons of mass destruction,

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:21.200
I would not have done what Bush did.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:23.350
Afghanistan, by contrast, was a war

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.750
that I thought was perfectly justified,

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:30.190
not only so as to extirpate the people

00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:31.790
who committed the act of terror

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:35.380
in New York, and Pennsylvania,
and Washington against us,

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:39.030
but also because the kind of
collateral humanitarian effect

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:42.660
of destroying the Taliban
also seem justified to me.

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:44.930
So my problem became then that,

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:47.500
but after not just 10
years now, but eight years,

00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:50.700
it became clear to me that
the Afghans don't want it.

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.430
They just want our protection.

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:54.100
Every time we go in, they're fine.

00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:57.340
When we move away, the
Taliban come right back.

00:44:57.340 --> 00:44:59.440
We're supposed to come back
in the next fighting season,

00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.160
clear it out, and they'll be fine,

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.810
and would they welcome us
then the Taliban come back.

00:45:04.647 --> 00:45:07.170
So I actually, where the Afghan war

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:09.190
seemed perfectly justified
to me and still does,

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:11.983
I gave up on it about
a couple of years ago.

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:15.110
And it's all on a case-by-case thing.

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:18.960
I do think that when there are

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.330
what I call moral emergencies,

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:24.080
and obviously some of this
has to do with reflection

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:27.310
on the failure of any
power to come to the rescue

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:30.690
of people like my parents
during the Second World War.

00:45:30.690 --> 00:45:32.750
That's kind of textbook obvious.

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:36.170
But still, I think that is
the that is the paragon.

00:45:36.170 --> 00:45:39.950
When certain atrocities at
a certain level take place,

00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:42.170
I think anyone with the power to stop it

00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:44.240
has a responsibility to stop it.

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.870
In most cases the United States

00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:47.510
is the one with the power to stop it,

00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:49.710
and in almost all cases the United States

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:52.397
is the only one that will
entertain the argument

00:45:52.397 --> 00:45:53.930
for stopping it.

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:56.940
So yes, you know, I don't think

00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:00.180
we're ever in danger of being
the policemen of the world.

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.118
I really don't.

00:46:01.118 --> 00:46:01.951
- Because of the politics.

00:46:01.951 --> 00:46:04.090
- Yeah, yeah, I mean people talk about,

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:05.100
you know in the last decade,

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:06.640
people have talked
about the United States,

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.180
because of Iraq and
Afghanistan, as an empire.

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:12.510
The British were in India
for 200 years, right.

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:16.090
We can't be in a place for
200 months before it starts.

00:46:16.090 --> 00:46:17.990
No, we're not, that's, I don't believe

00:46:19.274 --> 00:46:23.000
that wild excessive
intervention is the danger.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.010
I think that American
diffidence about the world,

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:29.780
you can call it isolationism,
you call it what you want,

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:30.670
is the danger.

00:46:30.670 --> 00:46:34.890
I think that the economic
analysis of strategic realities

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:35.900
is the danger.

00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:37.710
It's not all about money.

00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:39.640
Even if China owns whatever percentage

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.470
of our Treasury bills that they own,

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:44.340
when people are in trouble,
when Syrians are in trouble,

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:45.610
or Iranians are in trouble,

00:46:45.610 --> 00:46:47.700
or Haitians are in trouble
after an earthquake,

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.190
or Japanese are in trouble

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:51.730
after a nuclear plant melts down,

00:46:51.730 --> 00:46:54.200
they don't go to China or
Brazil, they come to us.

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.280
And quite rightly, because they know

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:59.030
that we're the people who
not only have the capacity,

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:00.710
the capability to help them,

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:03.310
but who will entertain
the thought of helping.

00:47:03.310 --> 00:47:05.253
We will actually consider doing this.

00:47:06.587 --> 00:47:10.090
- To change subjects,
because you wear many hats,

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:13.550
and I'm trying to touch on all of them.

00:47:13.550 --> 00:47:16.980
Let's talk about the
changes at The New Republic

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:20.420
and being a literary editor.

00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:22.980
And what I have in mind here is

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.920
the tradition that you represent

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:29.350
is really generally threatened

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:31.870
by the commercialization of publishing,

00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:33.260
by the web and so on.

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:38.001
How do we navigate these transitions

00:47:38.001 --> 00:47:42.860
and preserve the kinds of
traditions that you are all about

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:47.860
in in terms of a liberal
literary tradition?

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:50.100
- That's a complicated question.

00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:55.100
I think that the pressures
on serious thought

00:47:56.710 --> 00:48:01.253
and serious writing in America
were always very great.

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:05.640
And people who held my job,

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:09.130
which is a distinguished
little perch in American life,

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:11.450
I mean I sit in Edmund Wilson's chair,

00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:14.213
and Malcolm Cowley chair,
and Alfred Kazin's chair,

00:48:15.524 --> 00:48:17.670
and people like that
were always complaining

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:21.509
about yahoo-ism and
middlebrow-ism and midcult,

00:48:21.509 --> 00:48:23.510
and there were always these pressures.

00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:26.650
And the advocacy and the defense

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:29.400
of serious thought and serious writing

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:32.063
was always a kind of embattled activity.

00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:35.060
You're right that in recent decades

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:37.933
it's become increasingly embattled.

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:44.500
The main threat, obviously, at
the very beginning at least,

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:47.820
seemed technological,
seemed technological.

00:48:47.820 --> 00:48:52.440
And there was this
deranged, dizzy first period

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:54.530
in the history of the internet

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:57.950
when it seemed that it
would overwhelm everything.

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:00.290
You know, I used to say
that they finally invented

00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:02.640
a medium of communication
with no limitations

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:05.813
of physical space, and
everything had to be 400 words.

00:49:05.813 --> 00:49:06.646
(Harry laughs)

00:49:06.646 --> 00:49:08.150
And of course it had to do with the speed.

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:11.190
It's all, but the technology
is all about the speed.

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:13.490
Now that has shaken out a little bit.

00:49:13.490 --> 00:49:14.730
That is shaken out a little bit.

00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:16.880
I see this in my work,
I see it everywhere.

00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:22.010
One can make the argument,
which I do sometimes,

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:23.700
and which I mean, one has to,

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:27.100
that if one wishes to
preserve what we recognize

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.720
as an experience of serious reading,

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:33.023
then the tablet can provide
such an experience as well.

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:38.223
The web, the internet,
blogging, all that stuff,

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:41.240
if it had never been invented

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.870
that would have been fine with me.

00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:44.520
Though I understand
that there are doctors,

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.960
and scientists, and dissidents,

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.650
who find uses for this
technology, and so on.

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:51.320
But I was, you know, life
was quite fast enough for me,

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:53.360
thank you, before all this.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:57.160
But the fact is that
the tablet does provide

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:58.763
an experience of a page.

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.800
It's one of the things that
we'll be experimenting with

00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:04.593
at The New Republic now, is this.

00:50:06.570 --> 00:50:07.740
My view has been that

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:10.820
that just because there were new bottles

00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:13.540
doesn't mean that the old wine is bad.

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:15.770
There was, as I say in this first period

00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:17.000
of the internet dizziness

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.760
this view that if there are
new bottles, we need new wine.

00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.780
It has to be shorter, it has to be faster,

00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:23.840
it has to be linked, it
has to be hyperlinked,

00:50:23.840 --> 00:50:25.940
it has to, et cetera.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:28.530
That's, whoever wants to
stay linked and hyperlinked

00:50:28.530 --> 00:50:30.420
and stay in the echo chamber can and will,

00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:31.940
and it's fine, it exists.

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:36.940
But the, you know, this technology
now has been routinized.

00:50:37.850 --> 00:50:39.040
It's, everybody uses it

00:50:39.040 --> 00:50:42.060
at all levels of American
culture, of American life.

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:44.520
So the challenge now is to find ways

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:48.413
to put the old bottle, the
old wine in the new bottles.

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:51.520
And to keep the old
wine in the old bottles.

00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:52.353
What would, I mean,

00:50:52.353 --> 00:50:54.970
this is a little bit of
a complicated metaphor,

00:50:54.970 --> 00:50:57.590
but I think of what we're trying
to do with my magazine now

00:50:57.590 --> 00:50:59.400
is to preserve the old wine

00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:01.110
in the old bottles and the new bottles.

00:51:01.110 --> 00:51:03.020
So we're, we have a, I mean,

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:05.760
this young man who bought
the, acquired the magazine,

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.320
one of the Facebook guys,

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.910
is an extraordinarily thoughtful man.

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:11.480
I mean, I've gotten to know him,

00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:15.750
and he's been supportive of
all the magazine's strengths,

00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:19.550
and he's interested in

00:51:19.550 --> 00:51:22.520
what people now refer
to as long-form writing,

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:25.550
but that means essays,
and developed arguments,

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:27.510
and serious criticism.

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:31.090
And so my responsibility,
his responsibility,

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:33.500
our responsibility, is not to mistake

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:37.170
a technological revolution for
an intellectual revolution,

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:42.090
and to use the new technology
to create and proliferate

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:45.410
the old discourse, which
is still necessary.

00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:46.550
You see I've always looked

00:51:46.550 --> 00:51:49.870
that there are still a large number

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:52.250
of serious people in this country,

00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:55.920
all the distractions and
temptations notwithstanding.

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:56.970
They're there.

00:51:56.970 --> 00:51:57.803
They're there.

00:51:57.803 --> 00:52:00.200
We could quadruple our circulation

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.560
without having to create one new reader.

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:05.890
We just have to find the
natural readers who are there.

00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:09.230
So in that sense, I'm not pessimistic.

00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:11.320
In that sense, I'm not pessimistic.

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:14.760
What I'm more pessimistic about are,

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:19.570
is whether this new,
wired culture of ours,

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:21.720
with its new interests, and so on,

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:24.930
will continue to produce
the sort of students

00:52:24.930 --> 00:52:27.930
and graduate students, or
young writers and thinkers,

00:52:27.930 --> 00:52:30.650
who will want to inherit
the old discourse.

00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:32.260
I have to think it will.

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:34.480
My greatest challenge as an editor,

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.360
and my greatest pleasure as an editor,

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.850
is in finding the heirs.

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:42.170
Nothing gives me greater
pleasure than to find the heirs.

00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:43.320
I find them.

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.680
I look hard, I find them.

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:45.930
They're good.

00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:46.763
They're good.

00:52:46.763 --> 00:52:48.276
It can still happen.

00:52:48.276 --> 00:52:51.809
- Which touches on a question
that I want to ask you.

00:52:51.809 --> 00:52:56.780
This amazing tradition
that you were exposed to,

00:52:56.780 --> 00:53:01.780
where are the places for
training the next generation.

00:53:04.355 --> 00:53:05.788
They're not in the
universities, or are they?

00:53:05.788 --> 00:53:06.900
- Well that's the problem.

00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:08.160
I mean, I think they might.

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.433
No, they may not be any longer.

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:13.560
You know, there was a period in the '80s

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:17.100
where a certain kind of traditional

00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:19.290
humanistic criticism gave way.

00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:23.580
First to certain kinds of literary theory

00:53:23.580 --> 00:53:27.880
and then to certain, what's
called, sociological approaches,

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:30.720
having to do with race,
class and gender and so on.

00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.900
Things were intensely
politicized and so on.

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:37.093
I think that battle has
been fought and largely won.

00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:40.203
I'm not that worried about that anymore.

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:42.900
I think that the problem is that,

00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:45.970
in part owing to the
technology but not only,

00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:49.373
young people now are taught
mainly to game things.

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.410
To game their courses,
to game their grades,

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:54.620
to game their applications.

00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:57.093
- So it's economism.
- It's economism.

00:53:57.093 --> 00:53:59.140
It's this thing that
they're taught to worship

00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:01.000
which is pragmatism.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.260
I mean, as a philosophy
and as a view of life,

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:05.010
I don't like pragmatism.

00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:06.970
As my as my old friend and teacher

00:54:06.970 --> 00:54:08.270
Sydney Morgenbesser once said,

00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:10.769
the only problem with pragmatism
is that it doesn't work.

00:54:10.769 --> 00:54:12.190
(Harry laughs)

00:54:12.190 --> 00:54:14.463
I think, I don't believe in it.

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:19.660
And I think that everything,
the smartest question

00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:21.090
you can ask in America right now

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:22.760
that young people are taught to ask

00:54:22.760 --> 00:54:24.580
is not whether something is true or false,

00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:27.020
or good or bad, or ugly or beautiful,

00:54:27.020 --> 00:54:28.630
but how does it work?

00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:29.463
How does it work?

00:54:29.463 --> 00:54:31.180
That's all anybody wants to know.

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:32.390
How does it work?

00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:33.990
And the really smart
thing you could say is,

00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:37.240
no it doesn't work that way,
this is how it really work.

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:40.283
That's the esoteric knowledge
that establishes you.

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:43.470
Obviously, at a certain level,

00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:44.730
one has to know how things work,

00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:48.600
but how things work is
not the reason to live.

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.360
It's not the reason to write,

00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:51.970
it's not the reason to have a family,

00:54:51.970 --> 00:54:53.270
it's not the reason to have a community,

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:55.421
it's not the reason to have a country.

00:54:55.421 --> 00:54:59.010
We don't have these things
because of how things work.

00:54:59.010 --> 00:55:00.160
We have them because we hold

00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:02.390
certain ideals, or values, or beliefs

00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:04.453
that we have to remember how to defend.

00:55:05.730 --> 00:55:08.800
So, I worry about these
things, I worry about these.

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:12.550
- How would you advise students
to prepare for the future,

00:55:12.550 --> 00:55:14.763
then, in this kind, yeah.

00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:16.533
- Well.

00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:23.740
Right now, it's a tricky
question because of the recession

00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:26.437
and people worried about
jobs and making a living,

00:55:26.437 --> 00:55:28.090
and I understand that.

00:55:28.090 --> 00:55:30.760
An old friend of mine many
years ago once said that

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.680
the reason so many
intellectuals could come up

00:55:32.680 --> 00:55:34.718
during the Depression is
because everybody was broke.

00:55:34.718 --> 00:55:35.910
(Harry laughs)

00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:37.480
Didn't matter if you were the broke one,

00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.363
because the bankers were broke too.

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:43.453
So there is, I understand,
I understand the anxiety.

00:55:44.450 --> 00:55:48.050
But I do think that
society gives young people

00:55:48.050 --> 00:55:51.130
four years in their lives in
which they can read and think,

00:55:51.130 --> 00:55:52.110
only four years.

00:55:52.110 --> 00:55:54.230
I keep telling young people this.

00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:55.680
When I hear, when I meet young people

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:56.880
who are accelerating college,

00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:59.160
I tell them they're mad,
they're absolutely mad.

00:55:59.160 --> 00:56:00.960
They'll never get it back.

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:05.083
And I think that I'm one of those,

00:56:06.050 --> 00:56:07.770
I hold out for the humanities.

00:56:07.770 --> 00:56:10.750
I think that people in college

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:14.503
should be force-fed the
humanities if necessary,

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:17.840
because whatever they retain
is going to affect them

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.273
in the deepest ways.

00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:22.340
And they'll figure out how things work.

00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:23.340
They'll get there.

00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:25.600
I mean everybody's going,
and they'll figure it out.

00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.130
You know, we're not, this
society is not suffering

00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:30.860
from a surfeit of people with
their heads in the clouds.

00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:32.565
That's not the problem.

00:56:32.565 --> 00:56:33.900
You know, we have young people

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:38.900
who were cold-blooded realists
at preternaturally early ages

00:56:39.310 --> 00:56:41.760
so we're not suffering
from too many idealists

00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:46.173
or too many poets, that's
not the problem we face.

00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:50.910
And I think college should
offer a certain resistance

00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:53.170
to the practical frame of mind.

00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:55.370
Now, it's hard, I see this.

00:56:55.370 --> 00:56:57.510
I have a nephew at Columbia right now,

00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:58.810
and I hear stories from.

00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:01.030
It's hard, it's hard.

00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:02.550
Everything needs to be gamed,

00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:04.113
everything needs to be gamed.

00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:08.350
- You talk about the
end-state of perfection,

00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:11.010
but more important is the capability

00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:12.330
to become more perfect.

00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:13.580
- Yeah, yeah, no, perfect.

00:57:13.580 --> 00:57:14.990
You know, it's funny,

00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:18.320
it's the distinction between
perfection and perfectibility.

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:20.870
You know what, there is a
16th century Jewish thinker

00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:22.810
who wrote in an essay on frivolity

00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:24.950
something that's always
meant a great deal to me.

00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:27.440
He wrote that, he said that,

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:29.900
human beings are the creatures

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:33.340
who are in their nature,
in their definition,

00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:36.610
perfectible, who aspire to perfection.

00:57:36.610 --> 00:57:38.360
He pointed out that

00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:42.520
if that is the defining
characteristic of the human,

00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:45.730
then in such a creature, in
a creature whose essence,

00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:48.090
whose essence is to aspire to perfection,

00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:51.260
perfection itself will
be regarded as a flaw.

00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:53.630
Because that's not what we're
not supposed to be perfect,

00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:56.350
we're supposed to be
aspiring to perfection.

00:57:56.350 --> 00:57:59.330
And that just, a great
deal of wisdom can be found

00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:01.700
in that distinction, a great deal.

00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:04.350
You know, people who
believe they're perfect

00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:06.080
are always wrong.

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:08.970
Our current president is an example, yes.

00:58:08.970 --> 00:58:10.860
But people who aspire to perfection

00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:13.510
accomplish extraordinary things,

00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:14.770
because they, and they do it

00:58:14.770 --> 00:58:18.240
because the aspiration to
perfection somehow manages

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:22.160
to bring the ideal and the
critical frame of mind together,

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:24.030
to yolk them together,

00:58:24.030 --> 00:58:27.190
and one doesn't fall away from the other.

00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:29.280
And that's the key, that's the key.

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:31.940
So that's the distinction
that I would make.

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:35.820
- Well on that positive
note, actually, I'd like to

00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:36.760
thank you very much.
- My pleasure.

00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.360
- For coming on our program.
- Well thank you.

00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:41.160
- And thank you very much
for joining us for this

00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:43.023
conversation with history.

00:58:43.869 --> 00:58:47.702
