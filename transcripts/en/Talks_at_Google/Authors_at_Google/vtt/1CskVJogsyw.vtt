ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Thank you
all so much for coming.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.140
My name is Artur.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.880
And I am really
excited today to be

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.100
able to welcome Evangeline Lilly
to Google in Mountain View.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.110
As you all know,
Evangeline is an incredibly

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.590
famous and successful actress.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.380
She's been in plenty of works
on the big screen and on TV.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.900
But today we're here to
talk about her new book--

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.880
first published work,
which is incredible,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.590
"The Squickerwonkers."

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.199
And just to let you
guys know, we're

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:36.740
going to be doing a little bit
of Q&amp;A and then we'll open up.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.823
There's a mic in the back.

00:00:37.823 --> 00:00:42.270
So if you have any questions,
feel free to come up.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.282
And with that being said,
thank you for coming.

00:00:45.282 --> 00:00:46.240
EVANGELINE LILLY: Yeah.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.011
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:48.011 --> 00:00:50.510
You guys are a better looking
group than the New York group.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.347
Don't tell them I said so.

00:00:55.347 --> 00:00:56.930
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: This
is going to go up

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.270
on YouTube, just so you know.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.790
EVANGELINE LILLY:
I'm never going

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.240
to be invited back to New York.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.860
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: So tell me
a little bit about the book.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.650
I'm sure everybody would
love to hear about that.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.050
EVANGELINE LILLY: Oh, I'm
sure everybody would really

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.716
like to hear about
other things, but I'm

00:01:13.716 --> 00:01:14.950
going to talk about the book.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.639
[LAUGHS] So I wrote this
book when I was 14 years old.

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:20.930
Well, I didn't write this book.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.130
I wrote a poem called
"The Squickerwonkers"

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.370
when I was 14 years old.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.790
And I carried it around
with me for 20 years,

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.979
with my mom asking me
periodically through those 20

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.520
years, (NEW YORK
ACCENT) when are you

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.729
going to publish "The
Squickerwonkers," honey?

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.270
(NORMAL VOICE) She's
not New Yorkian.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.936
But for some reason
when you play a mom,

00:01:35.936 --> 00:01:39.910
it just works so much better
when you use a New York accent.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.520
And I mean, I've been
pining after the notion

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.440
of becoming a writer
for a very long time.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.340
For any of you who have
ever watched me in interview

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.920
during my acting
gigs, you know I'm

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.440
sort of a reluctant actress,
and do it is a day job,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.030
but my passion is writing.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.350
So this is a crazy
momentous moment for me

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.210
to be a published author, and
to be talking about my book.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.450
And it means the world to me.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.639
And I've poured three years of
full-time work into this book.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:14.300
And it's the first of 18 in
a series of Squickerwonker

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.150
stories for your kids, and
apparently for their kids.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.700
Because by the time
I'm on book 18,

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.010
they'll be having children also.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.670
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: I was saving
the 18 books in the series--

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.670
EVANGELINE LILLY: Sorry.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.780
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: --question
for a little bit later.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.440
No, no, this is great.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.530
EVANGELINE LILLY:
Jumped the gun.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.350
ARTUR OLIVEIRA:
Did Peter Jackson

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.750
have anything to do with this?

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:32.416
Or was he like--

00:02:32.416 --> 00:02:33.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.520
--three is not enough.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.410
EVANGELINE LILLY: Because
it's 18 books, is that why?

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.160
I was honored to have
Peter and his partners,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.074
Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens,
write the forward for the book.

00:02:48.074 --> 00:02:49.490
When I was working
on "The Hobbit"

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.406
is when I first started
working on this story.

00:02:51.406 --> 00:02:54.540
And I would bring
proofs to them to look

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.860
at-- Philippa and Fran-- who
have written the films that you

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.610
all know and love.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.985
"The Lord of the Rings" trilogy
and "The Hobbit" trilogy.

00:03:00.985 --> 00:03:03.660
They helped me edit the book.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.360
I was the luckiest
first time author

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.367
in the world to be surrounded
by the incredible talent

00:03:08.367 --> 00:03:09.700
that I was when I was making it.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.600
And actually, I found him
through working on "The Hobbit"

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.690
also, because he worked
at the Weta Workshop who

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.060
create all of the creative--
they create the armor,

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.480
they create a lot of the
elements of the costume,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.530
and they do the concept design
for all of Pete's movies.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.770
So he was a very,
very lucky find.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.770
For any of you who have
the book in your hands,

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.061
you'll have already seen that
the illustrations are out

00:03:32.061 --> 00:03:33.400
of this world.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.480
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Yeah,
the illustrations really

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.860
are amazing, for
those of you who

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.270
haven't had a chance
to see it yet.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.810
EVANGELINE LILLY: Actually,
speaking of which,

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.101
this is probably a perfect
segue into this little thing

00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:44.720
right here, which is
a Johnny Fraser-Allen

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.970
original watercolor.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.490
This is one of the two-page
spreads in the book.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.130
But this is the watercolor
version that's non-digitized.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.670
So it's not quite as vibrant
as what you see in the book.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.270
And it's going to
be prints of these,

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.750
and prints of the
illustrations are

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.220
being sold by the National
Museum for American

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.895
Illustration, because they were
so impressed with the artwork

00:04:05.895 --> 00:04:08.020
in the book, they wanted
to display it in some way.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.894
They wanted to participate
in it in some way.

00:04:09.894 --> 00:04:12.010
So that was an incredible
honor for our book

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.501
to be recognized by that museum.

00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:17.500
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: It really
is a great combination

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.930
of your rhymes with his artwork.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.630
I mean, the book is beautiful.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.680
And as you were saying, it's
not just for children, right?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.550
It's for children of all ages.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.600
EVANGELINE LILLY: Yeah,
I mean, my son's three.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.790
The publishers have
to give a demographic.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:31.516
So they say five to eight.

00:04:31.516 --> 00:04:34.940
My son's three and I'm
35, and we both love it.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.670
So it's for everybody.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.260
Even my 13-year-old niece,
when I was testing it,

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.601
I had her read it.

00:04:42.601 --> 00:04:44.600
And she read it through,
and she was like, yeah,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.360
it's really good.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.962
It's great.

00:04:45.962 --> 00:04:47.670
And then suddenly she
got really sheepish

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:51.830
in her teenage pre-teen way,
and she was like, wait a minute.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.310
Aunty, is this a book for kids?

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.270
And I said, yeah, it's
technically a book for kids.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.570
And I could see her
expression was mortified.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.540
So I went, but it's cool
if older people like it.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:04.650
I mean, I like it.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.650
And she was like, oh, thank
god, because I really like it,

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.910
and it's really embarrassing
if it's a kid's book.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.570
I want one.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.860
So that's my teenage
niece's testimony

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.644
that it's for kids of all ages.

00:05:16.644 --> 00:05:18.810
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Another
thing I think is interesting

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.784
that I've read you
say about the book

00:05:21.784 --> 00:05:24.325
and about writing in general is
that it's your true passion--

00:05:24.325 --> 00:05:24.720
EVANGELINE LILLY: Yeah.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.803
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: --correct?

00:05:25.803 --> 00:05:30.070
And I think, to me, what's
fascinating is you're already

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.049
so successful with your acting--

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:34.590
EVANGELINE LILLY:
Don't be so greedy.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.033
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.704
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: How does
that translate into writing?

00:05:40.704 --> 00:05:42.620
Because you have something
that's established.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:44.400
You have something
that people know you--

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.230
they know you through
that kind of work.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.606
Can you talk a little bit
about that transition process,

00:05:49.606 --> 00:05:51.230
and what it's like
now to start writing

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.647
and finally coming out to the
public with your first work?

00:05:53.647 --> 00:05:55.271
EVANGELINE LILLY:
Well, I think there's

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.600
a lot of fatigue and
intolerance surrounding

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.790
actors and their pet projects.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.290
And I think a lot of people
go, oh, yeah, OK, another actor

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.297
wants to be a singer.

00:06:04.297 --> 00:06:05.880
Or another actor
wants to be a writer.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.000
Or another actor wants
to be a director.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.310
And I think that a big
part of that is probably

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.570
because what people
probably don't realize

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:17.200
is that actors in the film
and television industry

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.630
have no control over anything
of the creative building

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:24.540
of the projects that they work--
I mean, very rarely anyway.

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.950
If you're Brad Pitt,
you do, because you're

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.430
producing your own projects.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.660
But most of us don't.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.870
And most of us are
very creative people.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.580
In my case, it's not just
creative frustration.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.900
It's that acting
happened by accident.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.350
And I was fortunate enough
to stumble into a job

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.080
that pays really well,
and that a lot of people

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.110
would dream of doing.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:49.080
And it just was a
happen chance thing.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.340
And it wasn't because it
was a passion of mine.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.710
It wasn't because I was
desperate to be an actress.

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.417
So what I do love and
what I have always

00:06:59.417 --> 00:07:01.750
done and been passionate about
since I was a little girl

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.990
is writing stories.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.880
As this book is a testimony to,
since I wrote it when I was 14.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.320
So this isn't so much a
passion project for me,

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.930
as a genuine attempt to
change career trajectories.

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.580
I mean, I've had the
disadvantage of publishers

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.800
thinking-- assuming-- that
I'm probably not very serious,

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.100
and not taking me as seriously
because I am an actress.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.070
And then the advantage of
filling a room full of Google

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:33.597
employees because they want
to talk to me about "Lost."

00:07:33.597 --> 00:07:35.058
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.430
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: I mean,
obviously the book

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:42.600
was published recently.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.480
But you've also got
the interactive version

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:48.280
on iBook, which seems
like it's great for kids.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.022
And you've got the audio
book on audible.com.

00:07:51.022 --> 00:07:52.970
And it's just in a lot
of different places.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.040
To you, how do you
envision people

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.590
interacting with your book?

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.339
How do you envision
them reading it?

00:08:03.339 --> 00:08:05.880
EVANGELINE LILLY: Johnny and I
both come from the film world,

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.129
so we couldn't help ourselves.

00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:09.840
We made a stop
animation film on paper.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.335
And that's how we envision it.

00:08:11.335 --> 00:08:14.410
And that's where eventually
I think-- I hope-- ultimately

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:18.160
it will end up on a screen
of some sort, small or large.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.430
But I'm impatient,
and controlling.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.760
And I couldn't
wait, so I started

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.440
making elements of
the film already.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.640
I partnered with a composer, and
we made a Squickers soundtrack.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.760
I partnered with Sylvester
McCoy-- some of you

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.609
know who he is.

00:08:33.609 --> 00:08:35.150
He's Radagast in "The Hobbit."

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.240
And he was also one of
the original Doctor Whos.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.070
He did the voice work
for the audio book

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:41.480
and the interactive book.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.617
And then I kind of brought it to
life a little bit on an iBook,

00:08:44.617 --> 00:08:46.200
so that children can
interact with it.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.790
And there's pop-up videos
where I talk to kids, saying,

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.920
if you're a bit confused--
because this book is crazy--

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.540
let's talk about these topics.

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.350
And it was just basically
me wanting more.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.190
I wanted a multimedia
experience with my own book.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.970
And I now am obsessed
with the idea

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.670
that they have to go together.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:10.602
I'm giving away the audio
book for free on audible.com

00:09:10.602 --> 00:09:13.090
right now until December
1st, because I'm

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:17.800
so desperate for people to read
the book with everything else,

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.230
with the sound
and the narration.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.271
And I just think they go
so beautifully together.

00:09:21.271 --> 00:09:23.536
And the music really
brings the story to life.

00:09:23.536 --> 00:09:25.410
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Something
I mentioned earlier

00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:28.480
is your writing, it
really is beautiful.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.980
EVANGELINE LILLY: You're going
to take up all their question

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:31.479
time.

00:09:31.479 --> 00:09:32.680
He's getting greedy.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.561
I'm telling you.

00:09:33.561 --> 00:09:35.810
This is going to be the
shortest talk I've ever given.

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:37.070
We have very little time.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.180
You're busy people.

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:39.520
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Right.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.020
I'm sorry.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.761
I should've had a clock
to keep me honest.

00:09:42.761 --> 00:09:45.094
EVANGELINE LILLY: We have
another seven minutes

00:09:45.094 --> 00:09:46.510
before we have to
start a signing.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:47.635
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Oh my gosh!

00:09:47.635 --> 00:09:48.730
OK, that flew by.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.010
I really do apologize.

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:51.990
You're right.

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.310
Let's get some live questions.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.325
And I just wanted to say,
"The Squickerwonkers",

00:09:55.325 --> 00:09:57.910
do you want to--
just 30-second--

00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:59.160
where does the name come from?

00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.200
EVANGELINE LILLY:
When I was a kid,

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.030
I was totally obsessed
with Dr. Seuss.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.850
And I just loved his
irreverent use of language.

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:08.100
I loved the fact that he made up
words if he didn't have a word.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.051
And I, being a teenager,
was like, well, he

00:10:11.051 --> 00:10:11.800
can make up words.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.170
I can make up words.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.220
So I started making up a list
of quirky, kooky, weird words.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.110
And one of them just
jumped off the page for me

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:20.240
and stuck in my mouth.

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.200
And it was Squickerwonker.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:25.380
And I thought, well,
what's a Squickerwonker?

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:28.240
So I ended up making up a poem
about the Squickerwonkers,

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:32.160
which are a family of
misfit marionette puppets.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.870
But originally they
weren't puppets.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.140
Hi, doggy.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.284
Originally, they were
just human, but not human.

00:10:37.284 --> 00:10:38.700
I didn't know how
that would look.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.283
It was Johnny
Fraser-Allen who brought

00:10:40.283 --> 00:10:41.860
the idea of the
marionette puppets.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.160
But there was this
clan of Squickerwonkers

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.440
that I wrote a poem for.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.960
And it just stuck.

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.780
And I still love the word.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.910
I just think it feels fun
to say-- Squickerwonker.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:53.070
I could say it 100 times.

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.254
I really like it.

00:10:55.254 --> 00:10:56.649
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Thank you.

00:10:56.649 --> 00:10:58.940
EVANGELINE LILLY: So there
is a microphone in the back.

00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.523
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Yeah,
the mic is open.

00:11:00.523 --> 00:11:03.550
So if anyone would like
to ask questions, please.

00:11:03.550 --> 00:11:05.340
And I'm sure
Evangeline would love

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:07.150
to keep talking about the book.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:11.250
EVANGELINE LILLY: Yeah, but
I'm tolerant and graceful.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:14.928
I know I'm going to get a
few wild cards in there.

00:11:14.928 --> 00:11:20.290
AUDIENCE: Well, I think somebody
has to ask this, so I will.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:22.750
Jack or Sawyer?

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.250
EVANGELINE LILLY:
By the way, I knew

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.090
he was going to ask a "Lost"
question, because when

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:27.673
I brought up "Lost,"
he laughed harder

00:11:27.673 --> 00:11:30.410
than anybody else in the crowd.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:31.730
A girl doesn't kiss and tell.

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:33.149
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:39.680
Have any of you
actually read the book?

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.220
Have you had a chance to yet?

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.000
Nobody.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.980
That's cool.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.190
I mean, normally I come,
and people have read it.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:48.900
So I'm like, oh, you
guys are in for a treat.

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.300
It's in the back.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:52.160
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Rose.

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:56.000
I am wondering, are you going to
stick with the same art style?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.260
Or are you going to do
different art for each book

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.094
if it's such a long series?

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:01.510
EVANGELINE LILLY:
Well, my plan is

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.885
to stick with the
same art style.

00:12:02.885 --> 00:12:05.480
I feel like once
it's identifiable,

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.010
you want it to remain
identifiable with the brand.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:12.350
But I don't know if I can
convince Johnny Fraser to stick

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:13.440
with me for 20 years.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.160
So we'll have to see.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.920
I certainly wouldn't
stray too far

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.546
from what has been
already established.

00:12:18.546 --> 00:12:20.170
It's been really,
really well received.

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.160
People seem to love it.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.060
I love it.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.600
And, for me, it's a great
representation of the world.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.500
So, yeah, my plan
would be to stay

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:31.180
as close to what you
see now as possible.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.870
I imagine it'll evolve--
all things do, don't they?

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:35.050
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:39.480
I was wondering, you started
it when you were 13 or so.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:44.820
And 20 odd years later, how
has your maturing and your work

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.580
in film and all of that,
how has that perspective

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.434
altered your
13-year-old Evangeline?

00:12:51.434 --> 00:12:53.350
EVANGELINE LILLY: Well,
when I first wrote it,

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:55.350
it was just a traditional
cautionary tale,

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:58.690
where- actually, it
wasn't really even.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.760
Let's put it this way, at
13, it was devoid of message

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:02.990
and moral.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.190
It was just silly.

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:05.500
It was just a silly poem.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.790
And when I started the rewrites,
which became extensive--

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:15.040
I rewrote it probably 30, 35
times in the last three years.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.420
I suddenly was a mom.

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.010
And I was a grown woman, who
had been through a lot more life

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:21.180
experiences.

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:26.130
And now, suddenly, I was trying
to infuse the story with all

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:27.670
of these life
lessons I'd learned,

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:31.550
and all of these ideas
about the world--

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:32.970
essentially, my world view.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:36.000
And one of things I went out
of my way to do with this story

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.390
is to break away from the
traditional children's

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:42.590
storybook model, where there
are good guys and bad guys.

00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:46.240
And the good guys are us,
and the bad guys are them.

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.990
And the good guys live
happily ever after,

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:50.367
and the bad guys get killed.

00:13:50.367 --> 00:13:52.200
Because I just think
that that's a worldview

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.060
that perpetuates starvation,
and war and fighting

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.440
and imbalance and injustice.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:01.700
And I feel like children live
in a much more balanced world

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.950
than that, believe it or not.

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:06.490
We all seem to have negative
things about ourselves,

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.000
and positive things
about ourselves.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.840
In my 35 years on
this planet, I've

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.609
never met a villain,
not face to face anyway.

00:14:12.609 --> 00:14:13.400
Not that I know of.

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.630
I've heard about them.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:21.320
And so the characters are all
partly good and partly bad.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.869
There's positive
things about them

00:14:22.869 --> 00:14:24.160
and negative things about them.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.450
And our protagonist, who is
this adorable little girl who's

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:31.840
very pretty on the outside,
is very ugly on the inside.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.520
And she gets herself into a
lot of trouble because of that.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.670
And our other protagonist,
the Squickerwonkers,

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.340
who are these puppets
who we're going

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.580
to follow through 18
books-- who are so

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:44.150
truly our protagonists--
they look ugly,

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.617
they look creepy and weird,
they have all kinds of vices,

00:14:47.617 --> 00:14:49.075
but there are
elements of them that

00:14:49.075 --> 00:14:52.060
are fun and lovable, and
unique and interesting.

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:55.300
And it's really a book to help
children and their parents

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.610
explore those ideas together
and talk about-- you

00:14:58.610 --> 00:15:00.870
can know that there
are things that aren't

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.890
great about yourself and still
be lovable, because everybody's

00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:05.520
like that, even mom and dad.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.045
But let's talk about
the consequences of some

00:15:08.045 --> 00:15:10.150
of your actions, and how
you can prevent yourself

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:15.132
from falling to harm because
of those things about you.

00:15:15.132 --> 00:15:16.840
I'm telling you, I'm
not going to get mad

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.506
if you ask about
"Lost" or "The Hobbit."

00:15:18.506 --> 00:15:19.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:20.107 --> 00:15:21.190
I know you have questions.

00:15:21.190 --> 00:15:22.898
And you don't have to
use the microphone.

00:15:22.898 --> 00:15:23.810
I could hear you.

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:25.940
Oh, wait, sound are
probably going to kill me.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:28.111
No, you have to go
back to the microphone.

00:15:28.111 --> 00:15:28.610
Sorry.

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:29.430
Do you want to use mine?

00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:30.388
Come, you can use mine.

00:15:30.388 --> 00:15:32.076
You can talk into my lap.

00:15:32.076 --> 00:15:33.700
AUDIENCE: It's about
the book actually.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:34.981
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.340
If you have--

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.312
EVANGELINE LILLY: Stop talking
to my boobs and talk to me.

00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:40.780
AUDIENCE: If you have 18 books
that you're going to write,

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.680
do you already know
the storylines,

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.864
or are they still evolving?

00:15:43.864 --> 00:15:45.030
EVANGELINE LILLY: Thank you.

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:46.321
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:51.110
If you're of the male
gender, you can't use my lap.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:57.240
I know what all of them
will be, so I'm not

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.710
shooting from the hip.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.430
A lot of people who
watched my show "Lost"

00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.740
complained that they thought
our authors, our writers,

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.340
were always doing that.

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:08.640
And I'm not doing that.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.700
I have a very clear idea
of what the books are.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.690
The Demise series, which
is the first series

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:17.040
I'll come out with-- which
is a series of nine books--

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.430
I know every single story.

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:20.960
I haven't written them
all, but I know them all.

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.550
I have written the second book.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.800
And then the last series--
the second series--

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:27.460
is the origins of
the Squickerwonkers.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:30.100
And that one I know what the
stories have to consist of,

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:34.870
I just haven't mapped
out the full book yet.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.370
I mean, the reason it's
18 books is not arbitrary.

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.160
It has to be 18, because
that will complete the circle

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.140
and complete the story.

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:44.180
And I can't tell you any more,
because it'll be a spoiler.

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.270
But it's 18 for a reason, yeah.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:52.590
Anyone else?

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.690
We've only got one minute.

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.471
You're going to
miss your chance.

00:16:57.471 --> 00:16:58.470
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Come on.

00:16:58.470 --> 00:16:59.860
EVANGELINE LILLY: I don't
know what was in the hatch.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:00.850
I loved the ending.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:02.242
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:04.470
What else can I tell you?

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:05.575
Being an elf is awesome.

00:17:05.575 --> 00:17:07.200
AUDIENCE: All right,
"Hobbit" question.

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.910
Deal with it.

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:10.910
I understand that your
character in "The Hobbit"

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:12.960
was not in the original Tolkien.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.819
Were you at all involved in
the process of figuring out

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:18.170
how she fits into this
world, and how she'd

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:20.068
be written into the
plot for the films?

00:17:20.068 --> 00:17:22.109
EVANGELINE LILLY: OK,
first of all, when you say,

00:17:22.109 --> 00:17:23.710
as you understand
it, are you going

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.273
to try to pretend like you
never read "The Hobbit"?

00:17:26.273 --> 00:17:27.752
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:31.356
AUDIENCE: So as I understand
it, she's not in "The Hobbit,"

00:17:31.356 --> 00:17:32.730
but as you probably
know, there's

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:34.729
a lot more Tolkien mythology
that's not directly

00:17:34.729 --> 00:17:36.730
in the books, but this
apparently still goes on.

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.853
EVANGELINE LILLY: I'm curious,
have you read "The Hobbit"?

00:17:38.853 --> 00:17:39.320
AUDIENCE: --not in "The
Lord of the Rings",

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:41.249
but apparently she's in
the Tolkien universe.

00:17:41.249 --> 00:17:42.540
EVANGELINE LILLY: Right, right.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:45.230
Well, Tauriel was a
complete invention.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.030
She's a complete
invention for the film.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.310
I did work very closely with
Peter, Fran, and Philippa

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:52.720
to create her.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.850
And I always very
tongue-in-cheek

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:58.270
tell people, though,
that she was in the book.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:01.330
As a person who was a
massive fan of Tolkien--

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:03.730
and "The Hobbit" was one of
my favorite books as a kid--

00:18:03.730 --> 00:18:05.700
she was there.

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:08.251
They just didn't name her.

00:18:08.251 --> 00:18:09.625
They talk about
the Silvan Elves,

00:18:09.625 --> 00:18:12.050
and they don't give any
of them a name or a face.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.030
And so we just got to
meet a few of them.

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.711
So she was there
all along, you just

00:18:15.711 --> 00:18:17.210
finally got the
privilege of getting

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:19.511
to know her a little bit.

00:18:19.511 --> 00:18:20.010
Thank you.

00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:22.220
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.524
EVANGELINE LILLY: So I think
we got to start a signing,

00:18:24.524 --> 00:18:25.940
or we're going to
run out of time.

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.040
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Thank you
all for your questions.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.790
I'm sorry for taking
up too much time.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:31.360
EVANGELINE LILLY: No, you
took a perfect amount of time.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.360
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: But
Evangeline's been very kind.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:35.730
She's going to stick
around to sign some books,

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:37.794
and take a picture.

00:18:37.794 --> 00:18:38.710
There's plenty of you.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:40.130
So we have limited time.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:42.700
But with that, we'll
just head to the back.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.616
EVANGELINE LILLY: Thanks
for coming, you guys.

00:18:44.616 --> 00:18:45.860
[APPLAUSE]
