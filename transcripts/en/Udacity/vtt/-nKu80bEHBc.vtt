00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome back to Statistics 101.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Today, we do a case study.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The case study is based on data that you, the students, submitted

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
where on Facebook you all discussed my weight,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and you've all see me in this class

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and a whopping 163 of you followed this very hidden Facebook discussion

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and submitted your guesses.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Thanks to all of you, I now have a data set.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In my first study, I will treat your guesses as my data or sample

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and somewhat abusing the nature of my own weight.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I treat my own weight as the hypothesis H0.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Technically speaking, this is a bit of an abuse.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We're not really testing  whether my own weight is incorrect,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
but you can still use the same math and have a lot of fun.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Towards the end of this exercise, you will actually find out my weight.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Please don't tell anybody.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Here is the actual data that was submitted by all of you.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
One of the really interesting findings here--some of you had some fun.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
In the data, you find a guess 1  10²², which is about the weight of the planet Pluto in kilograms.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Then there are three counter guesses with -1,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
which makes me suspect that these numbers were submitted by the same person.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Some of you think I weigh 0 whereas others think I weigh 1000 kg--as much as a car.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Thank you so much. Very kind of you.

00:01:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Let's take this data, and I'll ask you the first quiz.
