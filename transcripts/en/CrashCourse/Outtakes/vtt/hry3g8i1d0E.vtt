00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.460
Episode 17

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.960
Take two.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:07.860
[Laughter]

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.020
I still can't get this.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:12.620
Hi. I'm Carrie Anne and welcome to Crash Cource Computer Science.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.400
As we've disgusted throughout the series,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.960
computers have come a long way from mechanical devices.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.660
Cable--

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.200
With CPU requests [stuttering].

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.780
The RAM can transmit just--

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.960
AH!

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.760
Thingsing--

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.440
[Crying]

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.220
You need like a, like something to punch.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.420
[Laughter]

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.440
Fetch the code, execute. Fetch the code, execute. Fetch the code, execute.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.060
Fetch the code, execute.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.740
Fetch the code, execute.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.660
Fetch the code, execute. Fetch the code, execute. Fetch the code, execute.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.160
And so on.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.380
This may now desire, require 3 clock cycles to execute one instruction.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.840
I messed up the last line!

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.120
[Crew laughs]

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.320
No word on weather it can run crisis or max settings, but I sus-- suspe--

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.680
And whenever possible, execute instructions that require different parts of the CPU.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.640
Over the next 60 years these business machines grew in capability.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.140
I've got this. I've got this. Come on.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.280
Over the next 60 years this business p--

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.080
busi--

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.700
Ah!

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.760
Over the next 60 years these business p--

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.960
No.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.360
Brain.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.840
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.520
Crew: Yeah. That was great.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.400
Crew: Okay. So, uh,--

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.500
Relax.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.000
Crew: Yup!

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.980
[Laughter]

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.540
Chillax time!

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.560
Un-nested between if and end.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.280
If

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.340
It's in another line.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.560
[Laughter]

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.840
Because computers with text so often, there are many functions--

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.460
I don't got this.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.960
I really don't got this.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.060
Let's cover some programming--

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.440
The American mathematician Alonzo Church, first presented a solution to this problem in 1939.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.720
He-- No. That's the wrong date.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.800
The result was a high level, easy to use--

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.980
I'm reading faster than the words coming up.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.680
[Crew laughing]

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.160
Alex, are you dying?

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.680
Kilby built his first IC's out of geranium.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.780
A rare and unstable material.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.580
Germanium?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.920
I said geranium.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.400
Which is a flower.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.700
Just like a film can be projected to fill the entire movie screen, we can focus a photomask onto a very small patch on silicon.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.720
Crew: It's not "just like". I like, the opposite.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.660
[Laughter]

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.460
I feel like I'm a stop sign.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.540
Interfacing with early peripherals was very low level.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.720
Requiring programmers to know intimate--

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.180
It sounds a bit weird.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.200
I feel like I'm playing bagpipes.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.740
[Laughter] [Imitating bagpipe sounds]

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.720
Ekka and his friend--

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.720
No.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.020
They probably weren't mates.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.420
[Laughter]

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:05.720
These would wait for the right spot to rotate underneath them to read or write a bit of data to keep this delay as fast as possible.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.160
To keep track of what a file is and what's a directory.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.880
Just give up there.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.820
Non-volatile, solid state drives.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.460
Or SS--

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.860
No one calls them SSD's.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.960
Crew: I call them SSD's.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.860
Really? Crew: Yeah!

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.960
Or SSD's as the cool kids say.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.600
Or just Brandon.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.260
Crew: Hey!

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.400
Luckly, newer versions of Windows have better protections and usually don't crash quite that often.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.580
[Laughter]

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.100
And that's a wrap on that video.
