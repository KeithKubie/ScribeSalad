00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:07.259
Hello?

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.500
Is anybody there?

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.730
I can’t move.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.029
Why can’t I move?

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.109
Hello?

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.680
Somebody help me!

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.830
Please!

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.970
The following is the first video in a twelve
part series on disturbing sleeping disorders.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.230
In this first installment, we'll be discussing
sleep paralysis; what causes it and how it

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.890
affects the body.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.340
Sleep paralysis is a feeling of being conscious
but unable to move.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.910
It occurs when a person passes between stages
of wakefulness and sleep.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.399
In the Philippines, sleep paralysis is often
referred to as the “bangungot”, and some

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.019
folklore has even suggested that people have
died from this.

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.079
Sleep paralysis happens during REM sleep,
when the body is temporarily immobilized.

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.999
This immobilization occurs as a natural way
to prevent us from acting out our dreams and

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:07.710
potentially injuring ourselves, but the paralysis
normally goes away once the body is roused

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.280
when we awaken.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.190
When experiencing sleep paralysis, however,
the mind wakes up often several minutes before

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.920
the body does, and thus, the body is still
paralyzed despite the mind being fully conscious.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.640
The experience can be terrifying, and it often
coincides with sleep hallucinations, where

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.550
reports of an evil presence are common.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:39.070
Also commonly associated with the experience
are the feelings of being crushed or choked.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.530
These sensations have given sleep paralysis
a firm place in the world of paranormal folklore,

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:55.350
and also in the world of alien mythology.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:05.670
So, why do we experience sleep paralysis?

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.420
Well, many people have experienced sleep paralysis
at some point in their lives, and it can sometimes

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.830
be triggered by sleep deprivation, anxiety,
depression, or certain medications.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.340
The key to dealing with it when it does occur
though is to not fight it, and instead try

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.569
to relax and take slow controlled breaths.

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.849
Then, while remaining calm, attempting to
move the extremities, such as toes or fingers

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.170
can often do the trick, as the feelings of
paralysis are not as prevalent in these areas.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.930
So, that’s it for part one of our series
on the twelve disturbing sleep disorders.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.409
