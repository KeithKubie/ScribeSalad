00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.160
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Good
afternoon everybody.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.560
And welcome, welcome to the,
to our reading room the African

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.860
and Middle Eastern Reading Room.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.160
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb,
Chief of the Division

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.060
and I'm delighted you
could be here with us.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:46.100
And for this special talk
with Professor Stephen King,

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.100
at Georgetown University.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.950
Before I start we have, we
want to point out to you

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:01.720
that this program is taking place
in the context of the Library

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.620
of Congress's collection;
so it is part,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.960
in a way part of the collection.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.170
It's going to become part of
the archives of the collections.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.560
And all our programs
in this division,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.770
other divisions are complement
the collections that we hold.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:29.200
So, this division is responsible
for 78 countries around the world,

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.470
in Africa, the Middle East,
Southern Asia and the caucus's.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:42.090
And we collect, we recommend,
we collect, we store collections

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:50.870
which come to us from our offices
in Cairo in Nairobi, in Islamabad.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.310
Those three offices
actually send us materials.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.470
They purchase the materials,
they catalog those materials

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.180
and they send them to us and
we keep them in the stacks,

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.870
closed stacks right here and
then we show them to researchers.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.750
This is one part of our activities.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.010
The other part of course, is to
because we are the public face

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.640
of the Library, is to
interact with the researchers

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.110
and the patrons, to serve them.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.570
We are public servants,
so we serve them.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.730
The collections, we're
experts in our fields

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.940
and this division has 21 experts.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:37.710
And we know the languages, the
cultures, the sources that we have.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.810
And we invite experts who are
outside of this institution to come

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.170
and to share with us their
research work, their thoughts

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.550
on the new trends in the fields of
African and Middle Eastern studies.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:03.710
We are in a way, a focus of
interaction between patrons

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.530
and between those who
serve the collections.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.230
We are also, we show films.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:21.840
We have displays and exhibits
and we invite scholars

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:31.420
to bring their students if they
can, to the library as well.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.420
We've moved from up
to the 18 year old,

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.660
we're going down to
15 and 16 year old.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.570
Younger than that, they should
be accompanied by their parents.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:49.190
But, anyway I want to put today's
lecture in quick focus in terms

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.480
of the Library's collection
on Tunisia.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.560
Some of you have already seen them.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.820
Now this doesn't work
quite that way.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:07.470
I was hoping it would, but anyway.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.170
Okay. So this is the
room where you're in.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.540
This is where we serve
you with the collections.

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.820
We have reference sources
for the journalists.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.870
We also have works on archaeology.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:27.020
We have ancient manuscripts, we
have old maps, those are found

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.600
in various parts of the library.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.820
We have prints and
photographs on Tunisia,

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.350
which includes the ones
you've seen and these.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.810
We have collections
of vintage posters.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:49.090
We have travel books on
Tunisia, World War II maps,

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.780
we have a veterans project
that includes veterans speaking

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.280
about their times in Tunisia.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.390
We have papers such as
the Roosevelt papers,

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.050
manuscripts in the
manuscript division.

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.450
Here is Stephen Kings
book and members

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:13.000
of others who are there as well.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.230
We have newspapers and journals.

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:30.000
We have a website of archives taken
from Tunisia at the when it was,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.590
during the Industrial Revolution;

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.570
so these are very specialized,
we have vigils.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.240
The law library has
materials as well on laws.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:51.690
We have literary works, language
dictionaries and materials

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.680
on linguistics, arts and
crafts, even cook books.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.090 position:56%
And definitely we have programs such
as this one and this is an example

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.830
of a program that took
place on Tunisia.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.600
Now, we also partner with
associations that work

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.650
on the countries and
regions of our interest.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:19.660 position:56%
And today's program is co-sponsored.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:23.590
We work together with the
American Tunisian Association.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.690
And many people today in the --

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:31.200
in this room are members of the
American Tunisian Association.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.760
I'm saying this because
we're being webcast.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.800
And the webcast appeared
on the libraries webpage,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.580
eventually, it takes a little time.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.280
We move slowly but surely.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.250
But eventually you will be
able to see this program,

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.720
and this program can be seen
in every part of the world.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.480
And we realized through
our social media

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.560
that other people actually do watch
our programs, and do check in.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:10.480
Angie Hall who is in our division
has put together a Facebook page

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.550
as well as organized blogs.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.140
Not only for this division,
but for all the areas studies.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:23.620
And I know she has distributed
some forms to you, so we'd be happy

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:28.650

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.040
of all the programs that
we're getting because part

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.100
of the things we put up is
a calendar of our events.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:53.090 position:56%

So, without any further ado let
me introduce Professor King.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:24.060
[ Applause ]

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:28.310
&gt;&gt; Stephen J. King: Well thank you
Mary-Jane for inviting me and happy

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:33.350
to see the audience here and the
broader world on this web case.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:34.700
Mary-Jane can you remind me

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.590
on the final title we
decided on for this topic?

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.080
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: It
was the challenge --

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:44.500
&gt;&gt; Stephen J. King: Well
the economic transition

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.030
that Tunisia, sorry.

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.050
[ Inaudible ]

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.990
&gt;&gt; Stephen J. King:
The economic transition

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:56.370
that Tunisia's democratic
transition deserves.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:01.560
As you can tell from the
introduction I'm interested

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.090
in Tunisia and I've
spent some time there.

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:11.720
Now my general research
interests in layman's terms is

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:17.960
that I'm interested in the politics
of the switch from Arab Socialism

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.650
or from Socialism to Capitalism.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:29.910
And by politics I mean in the way
that Harold Ashwell defined it.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:34.890
Who gets what, when and how?

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:40.890
And the switch from Arab
Socialism to Capitalism

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:46.520
within the literature
is usually grouped

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.130
under the political
economy of development.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:55.860
And largely begins with the
economic development strategies

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.430
of these countries.

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:01.110
And coming to most of the
developing world, they're world,

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:07.900
Tunisia included made a
transition from Arab Socialism,

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:16.480
which meant the practice stayed
on enterprises, land reform,

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:26.380
a new social contract
to provide basic food

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:29.530
and fuel and housing, education.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:35.900
The new social contract after
independence for development.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:40.140
The second strategy is the
strategy that's been implemented

00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:42.890
over the last two to three decades.

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:46.890
It's usually called the
Washington Consensus.

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:53.560
And clearly it's a switch
to policies that are based

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:59.660
on market reforms, market
forces, privatization,

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:06.100
capitalism broadly said and
this Washington Consensus set

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:14.530
of policies have been advocated
by the World Bank and IMF for,

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:17.300
since about the 80's I suppose.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:22.630 position:56%
And connected to the loans that they
provide developing countries there

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.410
are these recommendations

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.050
to implement those
Washington Consensus.

00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:32.440
The Washington Consensus,
it has 10 policies.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:38.650
And I won't talk about them all,
but the advice is in two areas.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:43.250
One is in stabilization of the
economy and for stabilization

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:51.130
of the economy they advise that
countries slow down inflation

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.440
through fiscal discipline

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.970
and improving the financial
position of the state.

00:13:55.970 --> 00:14:04.290
Now the one policy I want
to focus on is budget cuts

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:08.000
to improve the financial
position of the state.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.010
Arab Socialism or that phase

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:21.330 position:56%
of the development strategies
included outlays by the state to pay

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:25.610
for the subsidies and fuel
and education and so forth.

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:31.850
So the advice is to cut those in --

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.350
&gt;&gt; Stephen J. King: And
engage in fiscal discipline.

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:40.760
People talk about austerity
policies,

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.000
recessionary, austerity policies.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.190
And when our countries began
doing these there was a reaction

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:56.390 position:56%
in the countries, the cuts in
subsidies were politically explosive

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.870
or bread riots across the region.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.540
I can't remember what year
they occurred in Tunisia.

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.060
But they occurred in Morocco,
Tunisia, across North Africa

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:11.190
and much of the Arab world, these
riots against the subsidy cuts.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:17.060
The other group of
policies are under the label

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.300
of structural adjustment.

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:28.250
And the ones I want to focus on
are free trade, free in prices,

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:32.130
privatization of state
on enterprises in land.

00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:38.780
Okay. And I want to highlight under
privatization, as privatization

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:43.060
of state on enterprises and
also privatization of land.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:48.060
In the World Bank and IMF argue

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:53.820
that the privatization should
benefit small land holders,

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:55.410
land owners.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:58.050
And why do they say that?

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:01.260
There's a belief that
small farm size,

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:06.460
family owned farms especially
they limit the supervision costs

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:12.810
of managing wage, labor and
the -- and enforcing effort.

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:14.110
You can get more effort.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.150
You don't have to supervise
your family that work hard.

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:22.500
And generally the small farms
tend to be the most productive.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:27.970
Large land owners can be
absentee or prestige land owners

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:31.830
and not use the land productively.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.560
There's a danger of over
production in large farms

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:43.150
and within the Washington Consensus
this privatization of land,

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:50.610 position:56%
this land reform is usually
suggested as a counter to the charge

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:55.870
that structural adjustment, that
the Washington Consensus helped,

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.860
hurts the poor.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:16:59.160
They argued that.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:03.280
The poor will be helped
with the land privatization

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.250
to the small family farms.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:14.590
So, going to Tunisia and Tebourba;
I'm interested in these issues

00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:19.370
because of this switch to
the Washington Consensus

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:21.740
and the politics of that switch.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:27.850
And Tunisia gave me an opportunity
to do research about this

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:31.790
and I decided that
there's less research

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:36.230
on the local level,
on land privatization.

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:38.360
And I won't stay in the capital.

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:40.150
I want to look at state
on enterprises.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:45.580
I'll look at the local level and so
I found a research site Tebourba,

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.430
those of you know Tunisia.

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:59.470
And the timing was the 1990's when
the end stages of Arab Socialism

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:00.890
in Tunisia were coming about.

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:04.200
They were privatizing the
agricultural cooperatives put

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.120
in place by Ben Salah.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.080
So, I got a chance to be there

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.760
on the ground while
they were doing that.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.350
So, I was there for a year and they
were going through this process

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:23.860
and so, to research the
politics as who gets what, when,

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:29.240
where and how I mean the Washington
Consensus, the expectation is

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:35.990
that well, family farms, small land
owners, the poor will benefit --

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.610
the society will benefit

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:43.370
because there will be greater
productivity and efficiency.

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:46.640
Farming will be -- as we move

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:53.610 position:56%
into a more market economy resources
will be allocated more efficiently,

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:57.940
taking the state out of the
economy, will stop corruption

00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:00.560
and all of these benefits.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:05.700
So I go and their privatizing
these farms and I went to four

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:08.600
or five villages around there.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.370
And the first step when
I got there was okay,

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:15.700
I needed to know land
tenure as it stands now

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.810
and what the plans are
for this privatization.

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:23.970
So, I go to the local
officials there and I ask

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:28.710
if I can see land tenure
information, who owns what.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:32.970 position:56%
That one question ended my research.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.490
&gt;&gt; The delegate said "Tomorrow
you go see the governor".

00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:47.010
And they revoked --
I was on a Fulbright

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:50.740
and they revoked my
research clearance.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:54.180
So, I went back to
Tunis and it was --

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.410
it took about six weeks
to get it back.

00:19:57.410 --> 00:20:00.180
And we got it back
because someone within the,

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.700
I think because someone working
for Fulbright, a Tunisian working

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.620
for Fulbright used his connections
to get my research clearance back.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:14.690
Okay, so I go and I
know that people worried

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:16.920
about when the authorities
were worried

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.510
about land tenure information.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:25.890
And I eventually got
it in various ways.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:31.810
I think the biggest was on some
wall in a local official's office

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:36.360 position:56%
and he stepped out and I was writing
everything down as much as I could.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:40.240
But anyway gradually I got an idea

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:45.410
and the overall story was
the land reform was upward.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.870
It went to large land owners.

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:55.810
It went to the best connected
local people politically.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:59.530
And so I designed the research --

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:03.430
I made a research design
where I would interview people

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:07.910
from different large land owners,
small, medium, local officials;

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:14.050
I was interviewing
everyone about these issues.

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:21.220
And I'd like to read a few of the
passages from these interviews

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:27.100
with these different
economic categories

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:31.970
in Tebourba while they were
undergoing land reform.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.670
&gt;&gt; Okay this was a poor peasant.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:55.880
"The workers have become beggars.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.940
The sun shines on everyone.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:00.380
Normally the state
looks after us all.

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.840
Why give the land to the rich?

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.390
They already have land.

00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:05.860
If you give them more, they will
no longer think of the poor.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:08.330 position:56%
What are they going to do with more?

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:09.810
Buy another car.

00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:11.110
It's no good.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:13.400
You find people with 1,000 1,000
hick cars while others won't even

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.000
have one hick car.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.250
The poor one at land, some
farmers before got land

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:20.650
and they're doing well.

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:24.470
But if you have connections that's
the only way you can get land.

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:30.070
Those who are fired like me, we
go to the administration asking

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.620
for work and tell them "You
fired us, so give me something

00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:38.340
to buy bread", nothing happens".

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.640
Another one.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.290
"The poor will always
stay poor around here.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:43.720
The poor like rain and
grass for the animals.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:47.460
The rich one allowed them to graze
on their land, before you could.

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:51.050
Now you can't".

00:22:51.050 --> 00:22:56.730
"If there's assistance from the
state, [Inaudible] will give 50%

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:59.070
of it to the people
and the rest he'll keep

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:02.640
for himself and his friends".

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.990
It goes on like this in
addition to the anger

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:12.290
at how the land was privatized.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:15.850
There was anger about
the state pulling out in

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:23.380
about land owners no
longer contributing as much

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:27.040
as they did before
to a moral economy.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:32.450
They're giving the land and the
moral economy in that area was

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:39.420
about -- for the poorest
getting enough resources to last

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:43.900
through the year, and part of
the way they got it was the gifts

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:49.430
of the rich during Islamic
holidays in that harvest time.

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:53.240
And that was part of how
they managed their budget.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:57.340
So there was some pressure trying
to encourage them to do it,

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:59.760
criticizing them for not doing it.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.020
And the wealthy that I talked
to said "Yeah, now we don't do

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.260
that anymore", we're
a modern society.

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.770
The state does that; we
don't have to do that.

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:11.540
So there was that tension of should
they help the poor in this time

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:14.810
when they're getting great
benefits from the state.

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:18.940
And through my interviews
with the wealthier

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:23.200
and with the government
people I got the impression

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:27.450
that the state was pushing
these land owners to do more,

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:32.090
give more in terms of this, at the
Islamic holidays during harvest

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:35.260
and it was like an offset for,

00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:39.070
okay we give you this land,
now you have to do this.

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:44.040
And that's how they
privatized the land

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.810
from the Ben Salah cooperatives.

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.110
So what did I take from that?

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:56.790
I took a few things; obviously
the land reform was upwards.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:25:01.010
That meant crucially that
what's behind the banner

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.700
of they switched the capitalism
and market forces and privatization

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.380
and the Washington
consensuses different.

00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:10.800
What's behind that banner?

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:16.170
What's behind that banner was
the powerful taking advantage

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:19.170
of privatization.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:26.490
Behind that banner somewhat pushing
producers toward an old moral

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:30.930
economy instead of the rational
act or productive people

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:35.870
that the policies are supposed to
trigger, it's supposed to support.

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:42.590
Okay, So that was my dissertation

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:46.910
and first book went
along those lines.

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:50.580
Later when I did research,

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:55.410
the research area was
about regime change.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:26:01.450
And literature this is you
know 10 years ago I suppose

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:04.710
when I started this.

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:07.320
The big debate, this
is pre-Arab Spring,

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:13.530 position:56%
was about Authoritarian persistence,
and for regional scholars.

00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:17.030
I was looking at that
and we were trying

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:24.120
to explain why this persistence
of authoritarianism in our region,

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:28.820
what can be done to
democratize the region?

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:34.180
Research along those lines and my
thought was this, it doesn't look

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.960
like we're moving towards
democratization,

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.260
but there's a lot of change.

00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:42.120
Remembering what happened
in Tunisia, in Tebourba.

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:48.170
I was thinking there are great
changes in economic policies,

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:54.730
asset distribution, and that's
within authoritarianism.

00:26:54.730 --> 00:27:00.950
So I, my next research was about
change within authoritarianism.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:10.460
And so analytical framework
developed was to look at change,

00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:15.340
in regime change by
looking at four areas.

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:18.420
One or what are the policies?

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:22.740
And the policies again, are
privatization, free trade,

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:27.490
land reform -- - right,
land reform upward.

00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:30.750
What are the basic policies?

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.210
What's the ruling coalition?

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:40.140
What are the political
institutional changes?

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:45.170
And what are the changes
in terms of legitimacy?

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:50.950
And so basically if we're going
from the Aram Socialism paradigm

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:55.680
to this Capitalist
paradigm the new policies

00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.420
or the Washington consensus
politics, we talked about that one.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:01.480
The ruling coalition at
the local level I figured

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.480
out were large land owners.

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:08.670
At the national level and
what stayed on enterprise,

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:13.010
I figured out doing the
research that it was the same.

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:16.140
The assets were going to
the wealthiest and the best

00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:21.240
and politically connected, they
became the new ruling coalition,

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:24.510
Arab socialism is more
of a populist coalition.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:33.060
This has become a ruling coalition
for a favoring the wealthy.

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:39.850
Institutional change, a facade of
multi-party politics went along

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:44.310
with this switch to capitalism.

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:50.870
And finally with legitimacy you get
some legitimacy from fake elections

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:55.280
and the other piece is how
much repression is necessary

00:28:55.280 --> 00:29:00.020
to make this regime
change in these four areas?

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:09.120
And so in that research I found
a similar thing as I found

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.030
in Tebourba, the most powerful --

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:15.770
getting great advantages
from that change.

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:21.590
They were taking these
advantages and they were aided

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:24.630
by a Washington consensus
set of policies

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:31.590
that said the economy will
grow; you'll end corruption,

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:35.220
all of these benefits
for this switch.

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:42.320
&gt;&gt; Is that what I found?

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:45.560
No. What I found was more
of a Crony Capitalist form

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:48.550
of authoritarian rule
is what emerged.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:54.450
And you know it's on the
ground, what did you see?

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:59.700
We saw ruling -- a small ruling
click and patronage networks

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:03.010
that were dominating the economy.

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:08.350
They use security institutions
in the police and the judiciary

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:15.460
to maintain power within
that, this small ruling click.

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:19.870
And now that's what the young
Tunisia looked basically

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:25.500
at the Arab Republics Tunisia,
Egypt, Algeria and Syria.

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:31.490
And there's an economist
who worked --

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:35.190
the Arab Human Development
reports that were a group

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:36.970
of Arab Economists working on that.

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:41.890
And I got to know Nader Fergani and
he was the head of that I believe.

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:46.950 position:56%
And I talked to him about it, what
was going on in Tunisia and he said,

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:48.280
"The same thing in Egypt".

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:53.970
And this is the crux of
our conversation about it.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.700
&gt;&gt; "Egypt's privatization

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:17.900
and structural adjustment
programs have led

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.260
to a brand of chronic capitalism.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:23.170
The operative factors are
very sinister cohabitation

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:24.910
of power and capital.

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:29.000
The structural adjustment program
is helping to reconstruct a kind

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.830
of society where a small number
of people, where a small number

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:38.300
of people on the line
share of assets.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:42.010
Privatization in effect has meant
replacing the government monopolies

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:44.050
with private monopoly.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:47.390
The Middle Class has been shrinking
while there's an enlargement

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:48.890
of the super-rich.

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:53.820
State owned enterprises have been
sold to a minority of rich people.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:57.110
The record of private sector
enterprises creating jobs is

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:58.410
very poor.

00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:02.000
We are not reaping the benefits
of an energetic bourgeoisie.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.740
What we have is a parasitical
comprador class.

00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:11.190
The consequences will be
no less than catastrophic.

00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:14.070
This society is a candidate
for difficult period

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:17.400
of intense violent social
conflict and the kind

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:20.420
of government we have will not do.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:23.560
A conversation took
place around 2009,

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:30.700
2010 just before the Arab Spring.

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:36.350
Okay so moving ahead
to the Arab Spring

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:44.160 position:56%
and we know Tunisia has made
wonderful progress in its transition

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:48.210
to democracy, with some
remaining challenges.

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:52.750
But by far the best example
and a lot of great progress.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:33:02.640
Part of what the Arab Spring
was about not just democracy

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:06.740
and human rights, dignity
and socioeconomic justice

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:10.390
and so the research
I'm working on now;

00:33:10.390 --> 00:33:15.930
part of it is about the
economic transition.

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:18.340
The economic transitions
that are going along

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:22.790
with these transitions
to or towards democracy.

00:33:22.790 --> 00:33:30.520 position:56%
And I did some research and
finally I found the vein of research

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:34.180 position:56%
from economists who know the region.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.790
And they were talking a lot

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:40.990
about it's not just a
democratic transition;

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:42.790 position:56%
it's an economic transition as well.

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:50.680
And what would be the best economic
transition for the Arab World.

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:55.290
And -- instead of the
Washington Consensus,

00:33:55.290 --> 00:33:59.760
this is their version
of what's necessary.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:08.610 position:56%
There are really five economic
transitions that need to take place.

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:12.160
One you need a developmental
state that is capable

00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:15.790
of implementing an
industrial policy, okay?

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:23.520
It's improving the capacities of
the state and giving it a role also

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.640
in fostering industrialization Two,

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:32.640
a productive private
sector wean off corruption.

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:38.760
Three, a vigorous social
policy focused on the young.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:42.480
Four, improved economic
relationships with the IFI's,

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.780
the region and the world.

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:50.730
Five inclusive socioeconomic
policy making.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:56.820
Okay? And their reaction
in general was this.

00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.760
After the Arab Spring

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:04.580
and recognizing the socioeconomic
causes of the Arab Spring.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:09.440
And we have to recall that
Tunisia at the time was portrayed

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:15.500
as the model for the Washington
Consensus having the best results.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:20.390
In -- and we found out after
the Arab Spring that some

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.350
of the results warrant --

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:26.770
some of the data, information
wasn't sound about Tunisia.

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:29.610
It was probably more poverty
than they were reporting.

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:32.520
An employment was probably higher,

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:39.000
regional inequality was
great, those kinds of things.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:46.710
So this group of economists argued
that economic reform strategy

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:50.730
that Tunisia deserves takes
advantage of the opportunities

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:54.360
for economic growth provided
by the global market,

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.500
provided by global markets

00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:01.010
in a vigorous private sector
while avoiding the simple minded

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:04.950
application of market
liberalization, privatization

00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:07.170
and a minimal state that led

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:11.730
to crony capitalist forms
of authoritarian rule.

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:14.030
Okay?

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:23.660
&gt;&gt; Now since it's been what,
six years since the revolution?

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:30.080
And how has Tunisia done in
regards to these five areas?

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:33.490 position:56%
Well I mean the developmental state,

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:37.000
increasing capacity,
a work in progress.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.210
The productive private
sector wean of corruption.

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:47.120 position:56%
There are a lot of complaints that
the private sector is still corrupt.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:53.520
And there's been a loss of
momentum even about trying

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:58.210
to get back the money that
was stolen during that period.

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:05.040
And by the way we have some
idea of who stole it in Tunisia.

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:10.020
And a lot of it as you know, it's
the extended family of Ben Ali.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:18.130
And the World Bank even had
this accounting of corruption.

00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:25.130
By the end of 2010 some 220
firms connected to Ben Ali

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:29.890
and his extended family were
capturing an astounding 21%

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:34.550
of all private sector
profits annually in Tunisia.

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:39.580
A small group of 114 people.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:48.110
Okay, so the efforts to recoup that
money from Ben Ali and his family

00:37:48.110 --> 00:37:52.760
and the cronies related to
them has stalled and as far

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:59.100
as I can tell a lot of this is
a work in progress obviously.

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:04.310
As I think [Inaudible] in this
government has suggest that we need

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:09.610
to reconcile without continuing to
seek that money; we need to move

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:12.670
on with our private
sector to an extent.

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:18.570 position:56%
I spend most of my days teaching, so
I'm keeping day to day up on this --

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:23.350
it doesn't happen,
but in the last year

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:29.550
or so these things are coming out.

00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:35.060
On the vigorous social
policy focused on the young,

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.680
yes that's occurring
and a lot of the money,

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:41.590
the aid money that's going
to Tunisia is probably going

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:45.780
to various projects, social
policy, helping with job training

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:55.180
or various programs to help
the young, that's occurring.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:38:59.890
The institutional development

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:03.130
of inclusive socioeconomic
policymaking.

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:09.050
Social dialog impacts -- that's
important because what would it do?

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:13.100
It would provide an opportunity
to obtain a more humane,

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:16.210
collaborative and just capitalism.

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:21.590
It would also help the
rationality of economic policy

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:28.320
because in those dialogues
what can happen is that workers

00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.340
and business employers

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:35.670
in the government can have the
conversation about expectations.

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:43.880 position:56%
What can be done without ruining the
economy and so that you collaborate

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:48.310
on the challenges, you
give the people who need it

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:52.780
and who participate in
the revolution to get it.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:59.040
Some concrete advances without
them being overwhelming, all right?

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:03.890
If you don't do it, what you end
up getting is economic policy.

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:07.690
It can be sabotaged by
strikes going back and forth.

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:09.840
Strikes, money is paid out.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.150
This is what was happening
in Tunisia for a while.

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:15.860
There was one example,
one town some people;

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:18.240
I can't remember what
industry they were in.

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.870
They were striking and the
government answered their demands

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:27.050
and then all the towns around
asked for the same thing.

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:30.560
So, that was not working.

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:36.770
So, having a national
dialogue about this

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:41.840
to move towards a socioeconomic
pact seems important.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:47.560
Tunisia in 2012 or I think
2012/2013 they've had a history

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:51.060
of national dialogues and
social packs that try Apartheid

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:56.620
under Ben Ali with labor,
Utica the economic association

00:40:56.620 --> 00:40:58.890
and the government.

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:03.180
And they agreed to form
committees I believe.

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:08.750
It was something sort of basic,
basic to explore this in 2012/2013.

00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:13.770
Then the instability, insecurity
the assassinations happen in the --

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:16.860
and it went to the back burner.

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:25.990
After the quartet does the national
dialogue that resolves that impasse

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:29.810
and gets the Constitution
through and the success of that,

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:37.610
the Nobel Prize and so forth led
by the National Labor Federation.

00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:42.020
People were talking; well maybe
we should do something concretely

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:46.290
in the economic realm,
that's just what we need.

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:53.350
And then the last year or so
this has been not he docket 2016,

00:41:53.350 --> 00:42:00.560
I think the -- I think they had it,
but we don't know the results yet.

00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.370
It's been -- it hasn't
gone on long enough.

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:07.170
But they did meet and I
think it was on the rubric

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:10.790
of an employment dialogue,
something more limited.

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:14.440
But then it also was different in
that political parties participated

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:21.480
in civil society but --
so that's happening now.

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:30.220
The last piece of advice
for the economy

00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:35.150
that Tunisia deserves
is back to the IFI's,

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:37.630
the International Financial
Institutions.

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:42.470
They need a better relationship
with Tunisia and you can tell

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:47.520
from what I've been discussing
what's happening in practice

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:51.870
on the ground is different from
the Washington Consensus that IMF

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:55.680
and the World Bank
are putting on paper.

00:42:55.680 --> 00:43:00.580
So the change in relationship
we also start --

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:03.160
needs to also happen with
IMF and the World Bank.

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.970
They have to recognize
elite capture;

00:43:05.970 --> 00:43:12.800 position:56%
they have to involve civil society
so that the policies aren't hijacked

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.550
to the benefit of a small
number, those kinds of things.

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:17.910
Is that happening?

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:27.970
It isn't. The 2016 was also
an IMF agreement for a loan

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:32.370
that went exactly back to the
Washington Consensus, austerity,

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:40.040
no real social policy and the
simple application of privatization

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:42.250
and free trade and so forth.

00:43:42.250 --> 00:43:46.420
So that was happening again
and got a bad reaction,

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:51.130
the [Inaudible] threatened
to have a national strike.

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:57.340
And there are some debate
"Well maybe we should instead

00:43:57.340 --> 00:44:02.660
of unilaterally putting these
policies in, we should open it up,

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:05.820 position:56%
collaboratively and democratically".

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:09.560
So, at least they're
discussing that and its --

00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:12.850
and that's where I think we are.

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:15.510
Thank you.

00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:20.290
[ Applause ]

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:22.450
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Thank
you, thank you very much.

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:27.600
And now the floor is open
for questions and I'm going

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:33.660
to take the first one and then I --

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:38.360
I wanted to ask you
about the process.

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:45.370
In the first stage it was changes
in the agricultural land ownership.

00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:49.820
In the second stage
it was austerity,

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:55.310
more and Washington
Consensus, those measures.

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:57.780
So, in the third stage
is the emphasis

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:02.670
on creating new industries
as you pointed out?

00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:06.100
And is there a market
for those products?

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:10.370
&gt;&gt; Stephen J. King: The -- the
World Bank and IMF don't seem

00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:18.610
to be convinced that an
industrial policy is necessary.

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:22.380
It still doesn't seem to
be part of the program;

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:24.690
so we're getting the same thing,

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:29.020
which by the way ended
up de-industrializing.

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:32.260
What the open up too soon
or without production

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:36.750
and de-industrialized industries
in Tunisia and various places.

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:40.220
And they're saying the same
thing, they're repeating,

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:43.300
there's no specific
industrial policy.

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:45.240
And the second part of
your question was --

00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:50.330
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Would
there be a market for --

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:52.650
[ Inaudible ]

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:59.070
&gt;&gt; Stephen J. King: Well I mean to
take advantage of the opportunities

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:04.280
in global capitalism, they need
you know, efficient products.

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:08.440
If they're competitive, they
are; if they're not, they're not.

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:12.170
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: I think
in their area they could be.

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:15.790
&gt;&gt; Stephen J. King: That, I
mean I think an economist would,

00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:19.870
who knows -- I'm more
interested in the politics of it.

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:25.240
I don't know the exact
details of which companies

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:28.240
that they should emphasize
and where they are on that.

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:34.840
I mean they had a manufacturing
base and regionally they were known

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.220
for progress in that direction.

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:43.670
But, I don't know off
hand the details of that.

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:45.240
Yeah.

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.500
[ Inaudible ]

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:50.510
&gt;&gt; What is Tunisia's
comparative trade?

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:54.430
[ Inaudible ]

00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:56.940
&gt;&gt; They have this free
trade agreement with Europe

00:46:56.940 --> 00:47:01.730
and the EU had it for some time.

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:05.880
What has been the impact
of that and does this work

00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:08.770
with consensus structure,

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:14.870
does it work in a more
liberalization direction

00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:16.170
of [Inaudible]?

00:47:16.170 --> 00:47:17.470
&gt;&gt; Stephen J. King: Yeah the --

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:19.420
when Tunisia was getting the high
marks prior to the Arab Spring,

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:22.680
I mean the reports
were it was working.

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.190
I mean, in olive oil

00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:27.210
and agricultural products
were the main things.

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:33.850
There was one paper on olive
oil led growth for Tunisia.

00:47:33.850 --> 00:47:38.150
And so I mean the World Bank,

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:46.710
they were getting 46 percentage
growth rates during that five,

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:50.110
six year period prior to the
Arab Spring, which is good.

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:54.090
So you know the numbers
weren't all wrong.

00:47:54.090 --> 00:48:02.470
And -- but moving from that,
that's a comparative --

00:48:02.470 --> 00:48:06.900
I mean the part about comparative
advantage, the East Asian examples

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:09.210
where the most progress
has happened.

00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:13.220
We talked about their products --
their products became competitive

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:20.070
in about a generation,
South Korea under park.

00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:22.510
So --

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:26.070
[ Inaudible ]

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:27.930
&gt;&gt; Stephen J. King: I mean
they had a development strategy

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:30.130
that the World Bank
and IMF don't consider,

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:32.280
the East Asian Development
Strategies.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.050
It's a different one.

00:48:34.050 --> 00:48:39.980
They've done the best, so it should
be on the agenda as consideration,

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:43.580
but that isn't -- because of the
East Asian model they have an

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:44.880
industrial policy.

00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:46.470
They have protectionism in order

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:49.510
for these industries
to get on their feet.

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:53.320
But they have a bureaucracy
that's different.

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:55.110
I mean there would have
to be great progress

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:58.860
in improving the bureaucracies
in Tunisia;

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:02.790
so that they can play the kind
of role in industrial policy

00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:04.880
that they play in East Asia.

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:10.240
But I mean the point is, Bill's
question is evidence seems

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:14.180
to suggest a need for a
dynamic comparative advantage.

00:49:14.180 --> 00:49:18.550
And that doesn't seem to be
part of IMF and the World Bank.

00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:21.780
That you start with this
olive oil like growth,

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.300
but eventually you need
to get to manufacturing.

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:29.890
And you need a bigger role
for the state in getting there

00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:33.280
than they've been willing
to consider.

00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:39.510
&gt;&gt; It's an interesting
anomaly, I mean --

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:46.080
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:49.660
&gt;&gt; Tunisia moved from a
government led oligarchy

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:55.160
to a privately led oligarchy
over time; still an oligarchy.

00:49:55.160 --> 00:50:00.380
And when of the recommendations
is the break down,

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:02.470
business classes [Inaudible].

00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:10.160
[Inaudible] Which leaves the IMF to
suggest that the way to do that is

00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:15.330
to liberalize [Inaudible] to get
rid of the banking and customs

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:20.450 position:56%
and all the internal regulatory
system which favors the [Inaudible].

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:23.700
You get rid of it, to
literalize it entirely.

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.050
They can't get that
through [Inaudible].

00:50:26.050 --> 00:50:28.830
They absolutely cannot.

00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:34.620
So how do you break down
the Middle Class oligarchy,

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:39.330
Upper Middle Class oligarchy if
you will that's totally dependent

00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:42.970
on government subsidies

00:50:42.970 --> 00:50:45.010
who experience regulations
on [Inaudible].

00:50:45.010 --> 00:50:49.190
&gt;&gt; Stephen J. King: It's modified
strategies, strategy of this group

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:52.370
of economists do talk about
that, about deregulation

00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:54.930
and making a business
environment better for all,

00:50:54.930 --> 00:50:59.620
that's one of their open
thrall, better and open.

00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:08.440
It's -- that's one of their
recommendations that is to do that.

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.610
How do you get it done?

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:15.470
I mean there are best
practices and they refer

00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:23.090
to involving the private
sector, I'm thinking now more

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:29.240
about the corruption part of it.

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:34.780
The -- and no impunity
for corruption.

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:40.250
If you prosecute the
people who have done it,

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:44.210
deal with the safe havens
abroad, where the money is stored,

00:51:44.210 --> 00:51:51.180
the World Bank and IMF using
their leverage to take steps

00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:53.600
that will prevent elite capture.

00:51:53.600 --> 00:52:00.940
It's a work in progress, that's
the directions that they outline.

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:07.100
&gt;&gt; I guess what I'm saying
is production goes further

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:13.760
than just plan stealing; it goes
to the rigging the economic system,

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:15.550
regulatory system [Inaudible],
that's one.

00:52:15.550 --> 00:52:16.850
&gt;&gt; Stephen J. King: Yeah.

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:18.150
No, they say deregulate.

00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:19.710
I mean that's what the
advice is to deregulate.

00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:24.510
Deregulation is a part of this
modified economic reform strategy.

00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:27.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:31.140
&gt;&gt; Stephan J. King: No, I
accept the, I accept and I defer

00:52:31.140 --> 00:52:35.900
to the economists that the best we
can do is this modified economic --

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:40.120 position:56%
this modified market reform strategy

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:43.650
that doesn't have [Inaudible]
privatization,

00:52:43.650 --> 00:52:50.820
trade and other policies of
the Washington Consensus.

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:58.780
And so it still, it's not --
their strategy is for capitalism

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:01.340
that is more compassionate,
that works for more

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:03.930
as a shared growth
kind of capitalism.

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:08.830
It's an inclusive Democratic
change to capitalism.

00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:14.310
And it's dynamic look at
capitalism where you change

00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:19.230
from what you're doing within the
capitalist economy now to something

00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:21.930
that gets more benefits over time.

00:53:21.930 --> 00:53:27.820
But it's still within --
it's still capitalist.

00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:29.620
Yeah.

00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:36.910
[ Inaudible ]

00:53:36.910 --> 00:53:40.710
&gt;&gt; Deregulation, privatization,
so-called free trade

00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:45.310
which is a misnomer [Inaudible]
trade agreements there are some

00:53:45.310 --> 00:53:52.290
areas that are [Inaudible]
protection aspects

00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:59.300
in terms of [Inaudible].

00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:09.940
A prime example is prescription
drugs and patent extensions

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:19.850
and copyright extensions and
the monopolies over those.

00:54:19.850 --> 00:54:23.610
[Inaudible] so it's not free
trade, its managed trade

00:54:23.610 --> 00:54:26.300
and the way that's been
applied with [Inaudible] is

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:29.320
that they be international
[Inaudible]

00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:33.720
and then local economy [Inaudible]
with that kind of dynamic.

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.190
So, what's happening with
deregulation is that businesses --

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:36.990
some businesses are
[Inaudible], others aren't.

00:54:36.990 --> 00:54:56.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:59.570
&gt;&gt; Those are being
dismantled under deregulation.

00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:07.240
Privatization has led
also to the benefit

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:16.880
of certain private [Inaudible], and
that's within the power structure.

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:25.870
So my question is whose
got the power?

00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:31.820
How do you present Middle
Class, Working Class.

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:40.980
[Inaudible] The Middle Class
[Inaudible] how do you build

00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:42.280
them up?

00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:45.030
How do you change the power
structure, build an economy

00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:48.190
that benefits the mass of people

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:57.380
and not just this global financial
system and then [Inaudible].

00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:02.100
That's a question for
[Inaudible] too.

00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:03.400
&gt;&gt; Stephen J. King: Yes.

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:07.760 position:56%
&gt;&gt; The policies in the US
[Inaudible] deregulation [Inaudible]

00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.200
with aiding and becoming
[Inaudible].

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:10.500
&gt;&gt; Stephen J. King: In terms of --

00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:18.670
&gt;&gt; How do you deal with that in
terms of power, economic policy?

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:20.660
&gt;&gt; Stephen J. King: Yeah
I mean they usually,

00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:24.700
the National Labor Federation
was powerful in Tunisia

00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:27.920
and the collaborative, the
social dialogue, having the pack,

00:56:27.920 --> 00:56:30.120 position:56%
getting people to make a pack that's
bringing labor, the employers,

00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:37.010 position:56%
government together to address these
-- to have these conversations.

00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:40.540
That's -- and to come up
with policies collaboratively

00:56:40.540 --> 00:56:45.750
that will help the Middle and
Lower Class, and also you know,

00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:50.150
the broader economic issues
that you're talking about.

00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:54.480
If we want it to be more shared,

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:57.900
it has to be a more
inclusive policy making.

00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:00.370
And Tunisia has scheduled that.

00:57:00.370 --> 00:57:01.670
They recognize that.

00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:04.500
And they're bringing
people together.

00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:08.660
I mean this -- it's just
within the last year

00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:13.150
or so that they had the pack and I
haven't had a chance to read fully.

00:57:13.150 --> 00:57:15.930
I know that they're
focused on employment

00:57:15.930 --> 00:57:19.700
and they were like
11 recommendations.

00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:27.870
But that's how accepting
capitalism but also dealing

00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:30.560
with changing the power structures.

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:33.450
And some of the economists,
the Tunisian economists

00:57:33.450 --> 00:57:38.670
with this socioeconomic pack
dialogue, they're more worried

00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:41.150
about labor than they're
worried about business.

00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:43.460
Because politically
labor is so strong.

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:50.280
And the labor might have
the power to demand enough

00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:55.720
that you don't solve the
broader economic issues.

00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:58.660
But --

00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:04.240
[ Inaudible ]

00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:14.570
&gt;&gt; I was wondering about what
recent stressors there are

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:21.630
on this privatization,

00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:30.570
this concentrated [Inaudible]
is there kind of a resistance

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:34.150
to what [Inaudible] are you
getting pressures from migrants,

00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:36.580
stressors from external
groups [Inaudible]

00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:39.510
and what are these doing to --

00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:42.060
[ Inaudible ]

00:58:42.060 --> 00:58:47.430 position:56%
Stephen J. King: The security issues
in external groups that adds --

00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:52.650
put socioeconomic dialogue impacts
sort of the -- on the back burner.

00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:57.110
It's one of the things that can get
in the way; that's certainly true.

00:58:57.110 --> 00:59:04.300
I mean Arab Spring we ended up
not getting the changes of that --

00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:06.150
the people, the economists
they were writing.

00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:08.610
They were hoping that
you can move to regional,

00:59:08.610 --> 00:59:12.800
more regional economic cooperation
because North Africa it looks

00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:17.030
like we might get new
Democratic governments.

00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:18.940
And you have a chance
but we didn't get that,

00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:21.440
Libya is where it is
now in this war.

00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:27.340
And so the, the regional piece
seems stalled at this point.

00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:28.640
Mm-hmm.

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:31.010
&gt;&gt; Can you talk about this sort

00:59:31.010 --> 00:59:35.880
of capitalistic model,
socialistic model.

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:46.660
Just wondering, has anyone tried
to find out [Inaudible] in Tunisia,

00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:51.480
[Inaudible] one or the other; or
is it just not on their radars?

00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:57.370
&gt;&gt; Stephen J. King: The, I mean,
I think there's a general point

00:59:57.370 --> 00:59:59.940
that Islam's tend to
favor capitalism

00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:02.790
and free markets, private
enterprises.

01:00:02.790 --> 01:00:08.790
There's more hostility, socialism
and the eastern block and atheism

01:00:08.790 --> 01:00:14.230
and profit, merchant and
private properties is important.

01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:18.160
In the Tunisian context the --

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:25.000
the leftist parties and the
national labor federation are --

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.030
they are enemies more or
less, not enemies but they are

01:00:31.030 --> 01:00:34.230
in conflict with the Islamists.

01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:42.230
And so if anything more
business orientated to an extent.

01:00:42.230 --> 01:00:49.470
They've tried to start their own
labor federation, the Islamists

01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:52.070
and as reaction to too much power

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:58.070
by the more left leaning
national labor federation.

01:00:58.070 --> 01:01:01.950
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jean Dobb: We have to stop
now but I want to thank the speaker

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:07.610
for a wonderful presentation
and to thank you all for coming.

01:01:07.610 --> 01:01:11.240
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
