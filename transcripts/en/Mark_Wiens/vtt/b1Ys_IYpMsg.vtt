00:00:00.157 --> 00:00:00.990
- Hey, everyone.

00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:01.940
I hope you're having an amazing day.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:02.780
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.060
I'm in Belo Horizonte

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.550
in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.440
This is a state that's very well known

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.190
for food across Brazil.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.140
But today, we're gonna go

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.360
on a traditional and market
tour of Belo Horizonte.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.000
We're gonna eat some of
the traditional food.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.130
It's gonna be an incredible day,

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.660
and I'm gonna share all the
food with you in this video.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.110
We're getting started at the market,

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.969
which is right across the
street, for breakfast.

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:26.552
(upbeat music)

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.350
Immediately stepped in the market,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.830
and you can tell there's a
lot of artisan food shops.

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.600
And we just took a few
steps into the market

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.200
and greeted with an
unbelievable chili store.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.020
There's at least like
20 different varieties,

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.010
all different shapes and sizes.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.320
She has Bhut jolokia.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.120
She has the Trinidad scorpion.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.013
She has the Carolina reaper.

00:00:55.275 --> 00:00:56.108
(woman speaks in foreign language)

00:00:56.108 --> 00:00:58.700
- (speaks in foreign
language) We got a single,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.630
a Bhut jolokia.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.910
The market is fantastic.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.670
It's clean and spacious.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.270
There's vegetables just sprouting.

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.103
There's garlic.

00:01:06.103 --> 00:01:07.971
You get the aroma of garlic.

00:01:07.971 --> 00:01:09.730
(speaks in foreign language)

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.280
You can smell the onions, the cheeses,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.180
a lot, a lot of artisanal foods

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.822
and very special high-quality
ingredients here.

00:01:18.822 --> 00:01:21.890
(upbeat music)

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.640
- We're going to call
the King of Crackling,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.968
that's in Portuguese
called Rei Do Torresmo..

00:01:27.968 --> 00:01:28.801
- [Mark] Awesome.

00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:29.634
- Yes.

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:33.330
(Guilherme speaks in foreign language)

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.218
- Okay.

00:01:34.218 --> 00:01:36.580
(Guilherme speaks in foreign language)

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.480
This place is called
the King of Crackling.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.500
It's just a standing bar
counter in the market.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.130
He has a cabinet case

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.740
full of just like ultra
golden crispy pork.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.420
And then he's also
gonna make a liver dish,

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.787
which is very, very
essential to Belo Horizonte.

00:01:52.787 --> 00:01:53.743
Rei Do Torresmo.

00:01:54.862 --> 00:01:56.413
- Rei Do Torresmo.

00:01:56.413 --> 00:01:58.160
- [Mark] Rei Do Torresmo.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.993
- [Guilherme] Yes.

00:01:58.993 --> 00:02:00.308
- King of crackling.

00:02:00.308 --> 00:02:01.141
- Yeah. (chuckles)

00:02:01.141 --> 00:02:01.974
- What a name.

00:02:01.974 --> 00:02:03.224
- What a name.

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:13.670
- (laughs) Like an
entire slab of pork belly

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.850
which is just completely crispified.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.340
He squeezed on some
lemon and then literally,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.920
like they don't chop it up or anything.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.140
They just hand you,

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.740
you just take the entire chunk
and take a bite out of it.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.500
Choose if you want the
skin part, the meat part,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.960
the fat part, the layers, the layers,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.860
and it's dripping in that lemon juice.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.540
It's so crispy and so like
fried and dehydrated salty.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.613
But that lemon juice,
that really adds to it

00:02:46.613 --> 00:02:49.603
because it really like
cuts the richness of it.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.820
Now that is an eight a.m. meat treat.

00:02:56.471 --> 00:02:57.570
Oh, the crispy skin and the fat.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.670
Oh, wow.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.140
By the way, Belo Horizonte
is known for their pork.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.310
And next up, these are just
the cracklings, maybe the skin.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.476
Just again, squeeze on the lemon.

00:03:06.476 --> 00:03:08.940
(woman speaks in foreign language)

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.006
And then I'm gonna, mmm.

00:03:11.006 --> 00:03:13.430
Oh, that's just completely
crunchy through and through.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.150
And then for my next bite,
I'll try some of the Ronaldao.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.490
Oh, yeah, this looks great.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.633
Oh, man, that looks
like a little fireball.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.663
Not too spicy, but the flavor.

00:03:33.252 --> 00:03:34.940
Oh, cow liver?

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.190
- [Guilherme] Yeah, yeah.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.030
- Another one of the local
dishes that we're ordering here

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.790
that's very common in the state is liver.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.950
I believe it's beef liver,
stir fried with onions

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.320
and something called scarlet eggplant.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.710
And so he's fixing that now

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.793
as we're crunching on the crackling.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.050
Oh, man, that smells incredibly good.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.160
The fumes coming out of
the liver, the onions,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.020
that eggplant which I'm
very excited to try,

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.083
the scarlet eggplant.

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:19.492
(Gerardo speaks in foreign language)

00:04:19.492 --> 00:04:20.390
It smells so good.

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.350
You get toothpicks to eat it.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.910
I'm gonna get some of everything.

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.750
Gotta have a nice piece
of that scarlet eggplant

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.670
'cause that's what I really
am interested to try.

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.540
Oh, there's a nice like
curly piece of liver

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.690
and some of the onions.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.513
Okay.

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:40.781
(Joel chuckles)

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:41.614
Mmm.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.653
It's so fresh.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.053
The liver is unbelievably creamy and soft.

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.480
The scarlet eggplant has a little bit

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.733
of a bitter taste to it.

00:04:51.733 --> 00:04:53.170
It's almost like cucumber.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:56.100
That is liver and onions
on the next level.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.760
Gerardo, he's the owner.

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.960
He's the chef.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.930
He's been cooking.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:02.500
He's owned this place for 24 years.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.330
He said that's the hottest hot sauce,

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.770
so we're gonna scoop that
on and then I'm gonna dip

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:09.103
some liver into that with
some scarlet eggplant.

00:05:15.244 --> 00:05:16.470
Oh, wow.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.970
Is there some cachaca in this?

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:22.255
(Gerardo speaks in foreign language)

00:05:22.255 --> 00:05:23.203
- [Joel] Is there what in it?

00:05:23.203 --> 00:05:24.186
- Some cachaca.

00:05:24.186 --> 00:05:25.574
- [Joel] Oh. (laughs)

00:05:25.574 --> 00:05:26.407
No way!

00:05:26.407 --> 00:05:27.240
- [Guilherme] There is, there is.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.073
- There is!

00:05:28.073 --> 00:05:29.030
Gerardo spiked the hot sauce.

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.650
Yeah, that's good, really good.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.190
Okay, now we gotta just taste
a little bit of the cachaca

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.270
because cachaca is one
of the most famous things

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.173
from this region, from
Minas Gerais, in Brazil.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.870
Yeah, that's strong.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.560
You can feel the fumes,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.273
and you can taste the like,
the sweetness of it for sure.

00:05:49.374 --> 00:05:51.957
(upbeat music)

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.673
Oh, the drip.

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.080
Part of the reason it's so
good is because it's like,

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.290
he's cooked it so perfectly,
not overcooked it,

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.364
so the liver is so juicy.

00:06:06.364 --> 00:06:07.197
(Mark speaks in foreign language)

00:06:07.197 --> 00:06:08.030
(Gerardo speaks in foreign language)

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.863
Amazing.

00:06:08.863 --> 00:06:10.980
Right across the aisle,
right across the lane

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:12.550
is the next food that we're gonna eat.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:13.925
- [Guilherme] It's called pao de queijo.

00:06:13.925 --> 00:06:15.960
- [Mark] Oh, because it's
the bread with cheese.

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.380
- Yeah, but we have the
plain pao de queijo.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.470
But here in this place, we're
gonna have stuffed filling

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.620
with turkey and the
Canastra cheese, it's--

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.453
- [Mark] Awesome.

00:06:23.453 --> 00:06:25.670
- Which is one of the local cheese

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:26.740
of Minas Gerais state called Canastra.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.830
- And that cheese is known in the state.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:29.663
- Oh, well known.

00:06:29.663 --> 00:06:31.220
- But then the cheese
bread, it's all over Brazil?

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.190
Or is it mostly the state as well?

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.910
- [Guilherme] Well, over
Brazil, but I would say

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:37.113
only Minas Gerais state
knows how to make the real,

00:06:37.113 --> 00:06:38.316
like the legit one.

00:06:38.316 --> 00:06:39.220
- [Mark] Ah, the real, authentic one.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.180
- [Guilherme] Exactly.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.490
- You can see that caramelized crusty edge

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.330
plus a slice of turkey and
then toasted in a hot plate.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.343
So it's like cheese
bread on top of cheese.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:53.763
Wow.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.870
That's like a cheese lover's dream.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.787
The bread is so soft and cheesy.

00:06:59.787 --> 00:07:02.070
You've got the crunchy
caramelized cheese in there.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:04.020
The turkey was just like strings apart.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:08.174
Wow, that is tasty.

00:07:08.174 --> 00:07:09.960
And Guilherme was just
telling me, explaining to me

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.320
this is really representative
of Minas Gerais state.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.530
They're famous for cheese.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.960
They're famous for the bread and meat.

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.223
Stick a jolokia on this.

00:07:28.496 --> 00:07:31.996
I had to get an espresso to chase it down.

00:07:33.205 --> 00:07:37.440
I just love the standing
space, just quick, on the go,

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.540
a bite to eat, and just
the market atmosphere.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.373
It's fantastic.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.640
That was a wonderful way
to begin this food tour

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:48.710
in Belo Horizonte today.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:50.868
That was a breakfast of champions.

00:07:50.868 --> 00:07:53.451
(upbeat music)

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.290
We're moving on now to a legendary place

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.340
that serves the cow hoof stew, soup.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:09.173
We're gonna find out.

00:08:09.173 --> 00:08:10.569
We met with the owner here.

00:08:10.569 --> 00:08:13.210
He's letting us into
the back of the kitchen

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.730
to get a look of the cow hoof stew

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.650
and like in the bar counter.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:19.218
What's the name of the dish again?

00:08:19.218 --> 00:08:20.090
- Mocoto.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:20.923
- [Mark] Mocoto.

00:08:20.923 --> 00:08:21.756
- [Guilherme] Mocoto.

00:08:21.756 --> 00:08:22.589
- [Mark] And that's the
cow hoof stew, right?

00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:23.460
- [Guilherme] The cow hoof stew.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.530
- It is thick.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:25.860
- And it's 24 hours.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:27.318
- [Mark] And it's open 24 hours.

00:08:27.318 --> 00:08:28.187
- [Guilherme] It's open 24 hours.

00:08:28.187 --> 00:08:30.655
- If you're hungry, if you
get a craving at 3 a.m.,

00:08:30.655 --> 00:08:31.863
you know where to come.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.922
Drip out the marrow.

00:08:41.922 --> 00:08:43.755
- [Joel] That's a lot.

00:08:54.613 --> 00:08:58.020
- He cracked in a couple of
quail eggs, just raw quail eggs.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.430
Then he reaches down to that stew.

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:00.540
He takes a couple of bones.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.110
He slices off some of that
collageny, gelatiny bits

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:07.450
from the joints, empties out the marrow,

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.110
scoops that into your
cup over the egg yolks,

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.850
the quail egg yolks, and then
he fills it with the stew,

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:16.100
which is just like pure like liquid meat.

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:18.050
And then he tops it
with some green onions.

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:19.863
That is fascinating.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.920
I love that dollop of green onions on top.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.290
And then you can just feel
there's no flour in here.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:33.220
There's no adds, just all
straight up cow gelatin sauce.

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.220
So you can call it melted cow.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.400
And there's pieces of the gelatin in here

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.770
that's mixing with the
egg already because it's,

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.833
yeah, with the quail egg.

00:09:47.904 --> 00:09:48.950
Oh, man.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:50.520
That is rich.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.353
Oh, wow.

00:09:51.353 --> 00:09:53.853
That's like literally straight melted cow.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.460
Oh, man.

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:59.520
It's like a gravy from a gelatin,

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:03.270
like jelly joints of
the cow with the marrow.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.350
That is flavorful.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:05.310
That is beefy.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.710
Yeah, you mix that sauce in?

00:10:08.607 --> 00:10:10.007
Oh, the whole yolk is there.

00:10:15.604 --> 00:10:16.976
- [Guilherme] (chuckles) Yes.

00:10:16.976 --> 00:10:18.640
- And Guilherme just doused my spoon

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.690
in some of that hot sauce that they have.

00:10:26.936 --> 00:10:28.448
Is there cachaca, cachaca?

00:10:28.448 --> 00:10:30.948
(cook laughs)

00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:32.887
(cook speaks in foreign language)

00:10:32.887 --> 00:10:35.240
It's the cachaca, cachaca.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.240
Yeah, that's decently spicy as well,

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.650
but you can immediately taste
the sugarcane liquor in there.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:40.640
That is intense.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.400
Oh, man. (laughs)

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.438
wow.

00:10:43.438 --> 00:10:45.100
- You have the spices,
but then immediately,

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:46.890
you know there's something
special going on.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:48.820
- That is a sauce of wonders.

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:50.730
That's an addictive sauce.

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.973
It is spicy plus the liquor kick.

00:10:56.610 --> 00:10:57.443
Wow.

00:10:58.776 --> 00:11:03.662
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:11:03.662 --> 00:11:04.530
Oh, that's amazing.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.180
That immediately makes you sweat.

00:11:07.048 --> 00:11:07.881
This is a beer?

00:11:07.881 --> 00:11:08.714
- [Guilherme] It's a beer.

00:11:08.714 --> 00:11:09.547
Well, the quantity,

00:11:09.547 --> 00:11:12.290
the recipe is gonna be like three glasses.

00:11:20.843 --> 00:11:22.930
(cook speaks in foreign language)

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:24.347
Chocolate powder.

00:11:25.762 --> 00:11:27.345
Cinnamon, cinnamon.

00:11:28.195 --> 00:11:30.064
- [Cook] (speaks in foreign language)

00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:30.898
Catuaba.

00:11:30.898 --> 00:11:33.926
- (mumbles) Catuaba?

00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:35.078
Oh, man.

00:11:35.078 --> 00:11:39.661
(Guilherme speaks in foreign language)

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:53.160
Okay, this might be one of
the most like bizarre, unique,

00:11:53.447 --> 00:11:57.560
borderline crazy beverages
called the (mumbles) de Caracu.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.420
Caracu is the dark beer
which is like a stout.

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:01.760
But before adding the dark beer,

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:04.430
he added in six, six quail eggs.

00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:05.940
Oh, and he stuck in the shells. (laughs)

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:07.200
I almost forgot.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.290
An intense drink.

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:09.898
We're just gonna taste a little bit of it.

00:12:09.898 --> 00:12:11.231
- [Joel] Cheers.

00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:17.710
- Whoa.

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.260
It actually tastes really good.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.303
- Delicious.

00:12:22.303 --> 00:12:23.214
- Rafaela, how is it?

00:12:23.214 --> 00:12:24.960
- Delicious.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.793
- It's actually amazing.

00:12:25.793 --> 00:12:29.440
It tastes like a sweet chocolate
milk but with extra foam.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.520
Unbelievable, like the ingredients in this

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.643
and then what it produces.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.660
Straight up like a chocolate milkshake

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.580
but with extra foam and richness

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.983
and like definitely a spike.

00:12:41.983 --> 00:12:42.816
(speaks in foreign language)

00:12:42.816 --> 00:12:44.650
(cook speaks in foreign language)

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:49.430
This place is called Nono, and
it is absolutely outstanding,

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:52.190
the service, the friendliness
of the owner, the staff.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:53.023
It's a community.

00:12:53.023 --> 00:12:54.900
Guys are hanging out, chatting.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:57.517
That sauce is, that's
a life-changing sauce.

00:12:57.517 --> 00:12:59.330
And that dish, it's so hearty.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:00.690
It's so warming.

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:01.540
That was delicious.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.280
It's a great thing that Belo Horizonte

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.980
is such a hilly city so
that we can work it off,

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:08.630
walk around as we go to
the next place to eat.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.130
It's quite a major, major city.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:12.300
And in the middle of the
day, it's just bustling.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:15.050
The buses just swing around corners.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:17.260
There's people walking down the streets.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:21.075
You get the breeze from the hills.

00:13:21.075 --> 00:13:23.253
Yeah, quite an amazing city.

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:25.580
Quick intermission.

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:29.083
I am hugely excited to tell
you about a new collaboration.

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:38.937
Oh, yes.

00:13:38.937 --> 00:13:41.520
(upbeat music)

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.400
They're so good, the
banana chips themselves,

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:51.180
but this is the larb flavor.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:53.830
And we're gonna be launching
with the larb flavor,

00:13:53.830 --> 00:13:56.810
but we are working on many more flavors.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.360
Also, durian chips are coming soon.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.900
But for now, larb is available.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.160
I'll have the link in the description box.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:07.160
You can go get a box of
Banana Joe x Mark Wiens chips.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.190
Again, I'll have the link
in the description box.

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.323
Thank you, and have some banana chips.

00:14:15.937 --> 00:14:16.770
Mmm.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.353
(upbeat music)

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:24.910
Next up on this food
tour of Belo Horizonte,

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:25.930
we're going to a restaurant.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:26.763
It's a cafe.

00:14:26.763 --> 00:14:28.017
It's been around since 1938,

00:14:28.017 --> 00:14:29.930
and it's a legendary restaurant,

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.610
famous for a single plate dish.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:35.820
- Created in the '50s by
the owner of the house,

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:38.490
Mr. Joao Ferreira, which
used to be his dad.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:40.318
The K is because of the cachaca.

00:14:40.318 --> 00:14:42.770
Cachaca, arroz, ovo, linguica.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.810
- They have a number of different foods,

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:48.050
but the real main dish,
the dish that they coined

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:49.980
the name for, but now you'll
find it all over the city

00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.300
and all over the state,
is a dish called KAOL.

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:55.640
That's an acronym. KAOL.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.730
Wow, very nice.

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:57.763
This is the classic.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.310
The sausage is on top.

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.280
There's rice all on the base.

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.670
It looks like almost like a poached egg,

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:05.960
but definitely a runny egg.

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:07.770
There's kale over here.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:10.550
This is some of the beans with
cassava powder, I believe.

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:12.610
And then finally, not
forgetting the crackling,

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:14.020
which is just like

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:18.500
one of the signature
ingredients of many (mumbles).

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.730
Everything you could possibly
want of comfort on a plate.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.530
And I love they serve it on
a metal saucer tray as well.

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:25.780
That's awesome.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:26.957
Okay.

00:15:26.957 --> 00:15:30.040
Oh, wow, it's a very
dense, very firm sausage.

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.310
You do actually need a knife for it.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.610
Oh, that almost looks
like steak on the inside,

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.930
like actual like meat.

00:15:36.930 --> 00:15:38.810
And then I'm going in for that egg.

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:39.923
You poke that yolk.

00:15:41.079 --> 00:15:42.370
Oh, yes, yes.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:43.783
It is a runny yolk indeed.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.760
Get some of the sauce going on there.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.810
Okay, this will be good for a first bite.

00:15:54.794 --> 00:15:55.627
Mmm.

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:02.680
Oh, that's a thick sausage.

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:06.170
The egg yolk, the rice, the
sausage is kinda tomatoey.

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.570
- I got the end too, so
it's like really textured,

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.140
like crunchy, crispy at the end,

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:14.020
and then juicy, really meaty.

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.820
- That's like a steak just
wrapped up into sausage form.

00:16:20.569 --> 00:16:21.402
Mmm.

00:16:23.064 --> 00:16:24.666
Is it cassava powder?

00:16:24.666 --> 00:16:25.499
- What?

00:16:25.499 --> 00:16:26.332
- Is that cassava powder?

00:16:26.332 --> 00:16:27.220
- [Guilherme] Yes, the mandioca.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.053
- The mandioca powder.

00:16:28.053 --> 00:16:30.020
I love how everywhere,
it's like Brazilian food

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.970
is not typically spicy, but
they always have hot sauce.

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:36.003
Actually, I wanna try
the kale, the vegetable.

00:16:52.263 --> 00:16:54.629
Hot sauces in Brazil is amazing.

00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:55.680
That one's like vinegary.

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.367
It just adds to the dish.

00:16:57.367 --> 00:16:59.310
The vegetable is excellent, the kale.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:02.690
And that sausage, it's amazingly steaky.

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:04.360
- [Joel] Okay, dude.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.660
- We got the Bhut jolokia
that we bought in the market.

00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:08.470
It's one of the hottest
chilies in the world.

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:11.060
It just looks scary.

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.290
I think we gotta take a bit of food

00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:14.490
and then take a little
nibble of this chili.

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.570
Oh, it's sweet at first.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.720
- Actually, yeah, that's
really tasty, wow.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:40.000
- Oh, the flavor of it is amazing.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.185
- Yeah, it's like fruity.

00:17:41.185 --> 00:17:42.650
- [Mark] Oh, it's not even that spicy.

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:43.690
Maybe yet.

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:44.523
- [Joel] Yeah, just--

00:17:44.523 --> 00:17:48.390
- It is decently spicy, but
it kinda like starts off slow

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:50.236
and it like begins sweet, right?

00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:51.520
- Yeah.

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.899
Yeah, if you munch on it a little bit,

00:17:52.899 --> 00:17:55.100
you can tell it's hot.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.290
- Yeah.

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:57.300
It's spicy though.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.040
It is spicy when you keep on chewing it

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:01.703
and when you just kinda let
it marinate it on your tongue.

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.360
We're just gonna chop up
that Bhut jolokia though

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.940
and then sprinkle it.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.920
Yeah, it's definitely powerful.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.220
It's definitely powerful,

00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:12.250
especially when you get
to the body section.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.610
And it's kinda like a slow build

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:14.940
because it's sweet at first.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.010
Your initial thought is it's sweet.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.693
The flavor is unbelievable.

00:18:19.933 --> 00:18:22.516
(upbeat music)

00:18:28.615 --> 00:18:29.448
Mmm.

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.760
The spice is starting to build though.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:32.593
- Mm-hmm.

00:18:32.593 --> 00:18:33.426
- You can almost feel that

00:18:33.426 --> 00:18:34.820
like going up your gums a little bit.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.533
The preserved chilies are really good.

00:18:44.961 --> 00:18:45.794
They're wonderful.

00:18:45.794 --> 00:18:48.873
Preserved, like slightly
sour, a little bit spicy.

00:18:52.578 --> 00:18:54.810
It's very, very tight in
here now, just coming out.

00:18:54.810 --> 00:18:56.670
Oh, man, and there are
people waiting outside,

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:58.740
waiting for stools, waiting in line.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:18:59.680
That was delicious.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:01.520
- The owner is so friendly.

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.300
What an amazing like
well-rounded plate of food.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:06.840
And that Bhut jolokia,
yeah, it's starting to like

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.940
burn up my gums a little bit.

00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:08.773
That's wonderful.

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:09.606
It was delicious.

00:19:09.606 --> 00:19:11.680
That was a wonderful,
wonderful plate of food.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.220
So after lunch, we have
decided to take a little drive

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.680
up to a place called
Mangabeiras, which is,

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.950
it's kind of a viewpoint, kind of a park.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.772
But we're gonna get some great
views of the city from there.

00:19:22.772 --> 00:19:25.355
(upbeat music)

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:35.940
You immediately step out.

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:37.210
It's so green.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:38.043
It's so lush.

00:19:38.043 --> 00:19:41.330
You can smell the aroma of
the eucalyptus, the trees.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:42.163
It's beautiful.

00:19:42.163 --> 00:19:44.403
We're just gonna walk to get
the viewpoint of the city.

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.990
And Belo Horizonte, it actually
means beautiful horizon

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:51.210
because of the skyline,

00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:54.420
because of the sky, because of the sunset.

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.003
(upbeat music)

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.980
We had a little rest this afternoon.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:07.990
It is the evening now.

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:10.367
We're coming for dinner to a restaurant

00:20:10.367 --> 00:20:12.377
that's called Bar Do Careca.

00:20:12.377 --> 00:20:15.670
And Careca, if I'm not
mistaken, means bald.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:19.430
This is an old restaurant
in the neighborhood,

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:20.640
on the corner.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:22.960
It's known for its traditional dishes.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.693
It just looks like an
amazingly cool little spot.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:28.803
- Anthony.

00:20:28.803 --> 00:20:30.690
- Anthony Bourdain, awesome.

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:31.523
Very cool.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.547
Anthony, we miss you.

00:20:34.547 --> 00:20:35.380
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.620
(Mark speaks in foreign language)

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:41.800
I love the scenery in
here, the green walls,

00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:45.480
the decorations, the antiques on the wall.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.700
On the shelf, on the top,
that's the owner's collection

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.420
of cachaca, the sugarcane liquor.

00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.890
That has to be like hundreds
of bottles up there.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:55.850
Such an amazingly cool spot.

00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:58.450
It is a bar, but they have a full menu.

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:59.630
It's kinda like a restaurant

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.470
where you do typically order drinks,

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:03.880
but the food is topnotch.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.773
They especially have food
from this region of Brazil.

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.550
The aromas from the
kitchen smell delicious.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:18.070
She's gonna make one of the main dishes,

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:20.606
which is the feijao tropeiro.

00:21:20.606 --> 00:21:21.458
Feijao tropeiro?

00:21:21.458 --> 00:21:22.291
- [Guilherme] Feijao tropeiro.

00:21:22.291 --> 00:21:24.980
- Feijao tropeiro, which
is one of the main dishes

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.790
from this state of Brazil.

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:29.590
You just have to eat this
dish when you're in the state.

00:22:03.076 --> 00:22:07.243
(cook speaks in foreign language)

00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:12.220
And they know exactly what they're doing.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.483
It's like you're at home here.

00:22:15.777 --> 00:22:18.360
(upbeat music)

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.153
wow.

00:22:47.153 --> 00:22:48.578
- [Guilherme] Kinda
like Brazilian (mumbles)

00:22:48.578 --> 00:22:52.328
(speaks in foreign language)

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:56.560
- They are such experts at cooking.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.060
They're so good.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.450
You can feel the motherly
love in their cooking.

00:23:01.450 --> 00:23:02.660
They are amazing.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.900
And I'm just like running
from stove to stove

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.530
trying to even follow them.

00:23:09.678 --> 00:23:10.511
Tropeiro?

00:23:10.511 --> 00:23:11.344
- Feijao tropeiro.

00:23:11.344 --> 00:23:12.761
- Feijao tropeiro

00:23:21.778 --> 00:23:24.361
(upbeat music)

00:23:32.799 --> 00:23:33.913
Wow.

00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:35.250
So all the food is ready.

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:37.270
It looks unbelievably good.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:38.740
The owner is amazing.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:43.210
The chefs, the aunties back
in the kitchen, they are so,

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:45.042
they know every dish by heart.

00:23:45.042 --> 00:23:47.190
I couldn't barely even
follow them on the camera

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:48.570
because they're moving so fast,

00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:50.660
and they know every
single step of the dishes.

00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.493
It's a pan.

00:23:51.493 --> 00:23:52.326
It's not even a plate.

00:23:52.326 --> 00:23:53.580
It's a pan.

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:57.030
There's like at least four
different types of meat on here,

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:58.580
plus the beans, plus the vegetables,

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:00.830
plus the kale, plus egg.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:02.653
This is a stunner of a dish.

00:24:03.872 --> 00:24:07.955
(man speaks in foreign language)

00:24:27.516 --> 00:24:29.782
Mmm, is that pork or beef?

00:24:29.782 --> 00:24:30.615
- [Guilherme] That's beef.

00:24:30.615 --> 00:24:32.040
- Oh, it's so tender.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:32.990
That's beef, right?

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.810
We all dished everything
out onto our plates.

00:24:38.810 --> 00:24:43.620
The feijao, it's so many components.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.263
Wow, the kale under.

00:24:49.727 --> 00:24:50.560
Mmm.

00:24:53.126 --> 00:24:53.959
Oh, wow.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:25:00.790
That is a masterpiece, like
the creaminess of the beans,

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:03.490
the starchiness of the cassava flour,

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.140
then you've got the
meat, you've got the egg,

00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:09.760
the silky egg, the
salty sausage, the kale,

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.650
the cilantro to kinda like break it up.

00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:13.770
Oh, that is outstanding.

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:16.310
And the onions which kinda
just dissolve in your mouth.

00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:19.140
The owner hooked us up
with this entire bottle.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:22.990
Look how awesome this is,
the home preserved chilies.

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:25.490
Wow, we need to add some
of this to the next bite.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.930
And I wanna, I really
want to dig into that.

00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:34.633
Oh, yes, the entire chunk
of pork crackling belly.

00:25:39.608 --> 00:25:42.275
(Mark chuckles)

00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.190
That pork crackling is huge.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:53.020
You can feel like the gummy
skin or the gummy fat,

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.123
the crispy skin.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.770
Wow, that is a mouthful of
crispy pork right there.

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:01.090
Okay, next, I'll try the scarlet eggplant,

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:03.940
which is what we had earlier
this morning with the liver.

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.420
It's incredible.

00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:11.270
It's kind of like zucchini
but with a bitter tinge to it,

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:12.850
like more complexity of flavor.

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:15.480
And then the final dish is
the cassava with the roast,

00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.110
but actually, the deep fried beef.

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:19.060
And it looks incredibly tender as well,

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.550
with garlic, with onions.

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:23.340
And she drizzled on that ghee.

00:26:24.838 --> 00:26:26.588
You can just see the strands of it.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:36.463
Just simple, meaty, tender, delicious.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.980
What I've learned is that
in the chili sauces here

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.620
in Belo Horizonte, they
use a lot of cachaca

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:57.133
instead of vinegar or
oil to preserve things.

00:27:04.393 --> 00:27:05.226
Oh, wow.

00:27:05.226 --> 00:27:07.830
That was not a light meal.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:12.830
That is some heavy, incredible
comfort delicious food,

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:15.050
an amazing meal, an amazing place,

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:18.740
an amazing uncle who just runs the place.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.590
Yeah, that was outstanding.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:22.350
One more thing I wanted
to mention just quickly

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.160
before ending this
video is that the chefs,

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.780
the cooks from across Brazil

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.810
are known in Minas Gerais state.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:32.440
So even Guilherme was telling
me, in Sao Paolo for instance

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.150
or in Rio de Janeiro, the best cooks,

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:37.300
the most well-known cooks and chefs,

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:38.820
they all come from this state.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:41.910
If you haven't already seen
this entire Brazil food series,

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:43.210
we're traveling around Brazil,

00:27:43.210 --> 00:27:44.690
learning about Brazilian culture,

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:47.290
eating incredibly delicious Brazilian food

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:50.490
and just like learning about
the diversity of Brazil.

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:51.750
It's been amazing.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:53.530
I'll have the link in the
description box below,

00:27:53.530 --> 00:27:56.450
but you can watch all of the
videos in the entire series.

00:27:56.450 --> 00:27:59.830
Thank you to Guilherme

00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:01.890
They run tours, but they also vlog.

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:02.910
They're making videos.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:05.240
