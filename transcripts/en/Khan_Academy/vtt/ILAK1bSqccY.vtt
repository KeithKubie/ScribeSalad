00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.020
- [Instructor] In the last video,

00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.720
we discussed one of the compromises made

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.810
at the Constitutional Convention,

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:08.460
the compromise of the electoral college.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.979
In this video, I want to discuss

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:12.610
a different compromise.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.740
The compromise over slavery.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.387
Now, you'll remember
that one of the issues

00:00:16.387 --> 00:00:19.390
that the electoral college
was trying to solve

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.737
was the idea that perhaps the revolution

00:00:21.737 --> 00:00:26.410
and the concept of
democracy had gone too far

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.540
in the United States

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.510
and needed to be reined
in by the more elite class

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.100
of American citizens

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.730
who would be better able to
make political decisions.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.010
But the flip side of this

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.139
was whether the revolution had perhaps

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:42.400
not gone far enough.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.750
In that, it didn't abolish
the institution of slavery.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.773
Now, the delegates at the
Constitutional Convention

00:00:48.773 --> 00:00:52.607
had sharply divided opinions over slavery.

00:00:52.607 --> 00:00:55.120
Those who came from southern states

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.470
tended to be elite white men,

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.634
who were themselves slave owners

00:00:59.634 --> 00:01:02.820
their own fortunes deeply tied into

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.570
the institution of slavery.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.620
In the aftermath of the revolution,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.530
many northern states began to either

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.630
outlaw or phase out slavery,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.200
recognizing that it was incompatible

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.189
with the system of government defined

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.320
around the concept that
all men are created equal.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.580
But if they were going to replace

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.570
the articles of confederation,

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.060
they were going to have
to find a way forward.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.900
And I would say overall, the
slaveowners got their way

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:35.980
more than not.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.860
Now, one anti-slavery
aspect of the constitution

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.480
was that it outlawed the
international slave trade,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.260
starting in 1808.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.970
So, here in article one,

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.860
it states that the
migration or importation

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.010
of such persons as any of
the states now existing

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.770
shall think proper to admit

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.120
shall not be prohibited by the congress

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.290
prior to the year 1808,

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.519
but a tax or duty may be
imposed on such importation

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:07.090
not exceeding ten dollars for each person.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.145
So they say, we'll give the
international slave trade

00:02:11.145 --> 00:02:14.270
20 years and then we'll get rid of it.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.830
And indeed, on January 1st, 1808,

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.190
the international slave trade was outlawed

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.260
in the United States.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.163
So, this middle passage
in which enslaved Africans

00:02:24.163 --> 00:02:27.470
were taken from west Africa

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.230
and brought across the Atlantic,

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.600
the end would never be
in the United States.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.381
But this doesn't mean that
they outlawed slavery,

00:02:34.381 --> 00:02:36.430
and it doesn't mean that they outlawed

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.280
the domestic slave trade,

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.120
the trade in slaves between
states or within states.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.710
In fact, up until about 1850,

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.950
one of the largest slave
markets in the United States

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.477
was just around the corner
from the White House

00:02:51.477 --> 00:02:53.050
and the US Capitol.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.850
So, imagine walking on the
streets of Washington DC

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.050
and seeing these buildings

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.844
where democratic ideals are enshrined

00:03:00.844 --> 00:03:02.810
and then going around the corner

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.940
and seeing women and
children and men being sold

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.770
and families being torn apart.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.156
It's a very powerful image.

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:11.340
But, although the framers did agree

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.480
to phase out the
international slave trade,

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.980
they made another compromise

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.782
that was much more
favorable to slaveholders.

00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:21.820
The Three-Fifths Compromise.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.548
Now, you'll remember that in deciding

00:03:24.548 --> 00:03:29.030
how the legislative branch
would represent the population,

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.000
in the Great Compromise,
or Connecticut Compromise,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.070
they agreed that in the
House of Representatives,

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.220
the proportion of representatives

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.850
would be based on population,

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.200
whereas in the Senate,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.140
every state would have two senators

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.740
regardless of its size.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.880
Well, the big question for this

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.000
is who counts as part of the population?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.280
Is it just white men?

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.990
Or do the large enslaved populations

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.650
of southern states also count?

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.623
Now, if you were a southern slave holder,

00:03:58.623 --> 00:04:01.530
you would have been strongly in favor

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.260
of counting this population,

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.630
because it means you
get more representation,

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.940
and thus more power in the
House of Representatives.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.045
If you were against slavery

00:04:10.045 --> 00:04:13.200
or from a small state, or both,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.280
you would've been bitterly
opposed to the notion

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.225
that people who have no rights as citizens

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:22.720
should be counted as
citizens to give those states

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.410
more power in Congress.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.630
So, here's what they decided,

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.520
according to article one.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.810
Representatives and direct taxes

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.180
shall be apportioned
among the several states

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.310
which may be included within this union

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.128
according to their respective numbers,

00:04:36.128 --> 00:04:37.690
which shall be determined

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.800
by adding to the whole
number of free persons,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.230
including those bound to
service for a term of years,

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.870
and excluding Indians not taxed,

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.741
three fifths of all other persons.

00:04:48.741 --> 00:04:52.166
This three fifths of all other persons

00:04:52.166 --> 00:04:54.638
really means enslaved Africans.

00:04:54.638 --> 00:04:57.810
And you'll notice that the framers

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.260
are really talking around slavery.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.380
In the part about the
international slave trade,

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.300
they said migration of such persons.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.640
Now they say three fifths
of all other persons.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.927
In fact, the word slavery never appears

00:05:12.927 --> 00:05:15.500
in the original constitution.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.297
So, why do they say three
fifths of all other persons

00:05:18.297 --> 00:05:22.100
or migration of such
persons as states think it

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.330
proper to admit?

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.883
And honestly, I think the answer to this

00:05:24.883 --> 00:05:28.310
is that the framers
were ashamed of slavery.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.355
They were ashamed that this institution

00:05:31.355 --> 00:05:34.550
existed in a democratic society.

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.620
They knew that the eyes of the world,

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.325
the eyes of history, would
look at this document

00:05:39.325 --> 00:05:41.967
and this institution

00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:46.660
completely sullied the idea
of a democratic government.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.748
So, as it says here,

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:53.748
their agreement was that for
every five enslaved people

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.254
who lived in a state,

00:05:56.254 --> 00:05:59.022
three of them would be counted

00:05:59.022 --> 00:06:02.220
for the purposes of population.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.422
This is a huge victory for slaveholders,

00:06:05.422 --> 00:06:08.760
getting more power in Congress

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.290
for having people who can't vote,

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:12.627
who can't be citizens.

00:06:12.627 --> 00:06:16.290
Why did the delegates of other states

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:17.600
allow this to happen?

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.930
And I think the simple answer is that

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.890
the constitution would
not have been ratified

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.100
were it not for this
compromise, among others.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.174
The states of the south were too important

00:06:29.174 --> 00:06:33.930
to getting that nine out
of 13 necessary votes

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.500
to replace the articles of confederation

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.240
with this new constitution.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.930
So, they made a compromise to make sure

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:44.040
that the constitution was
ratified and improved.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.048
But that compromise would
have tremendous consequences

00:06:47.048 --> 00:06:50.960
for the generations of enslaved people

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.060
who would live under that system.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.660
And for the nation when the
Civil War broke out in 1865.
