I think one of the more interesting

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040
I think one of the more interesting
 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.519
I think one of the more interesting
things is focused now on individual

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529
things is focused now on individual
 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.810
things is focused now on individual
differences you know with you condition

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820
differences you know with you condition
 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.269
differences you know with you condition
10 rats or 20 rats to be afraid of a

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:14.279
10 rats or 20 rats to be afraid of a
 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:17.090
10 rats or 20 rats to be afraid of a
sound paired with a shock and you find

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100
sound paired with a shock and you find
 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.950
sound paired with a shock and you find
that some are very afraid and some are

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
that some are very afraid and some are
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.390
that some are very afraid and some are
not very for hidden the others are come

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400
not very for hidden the others are come
 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.640
not very for hidden the others are come
in the middle and so the typical way of

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650
in the middle and so the typical way of
 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.080
in the middle and so the typical way of
dealing with that is you average it all

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090
dealing with that is you average it all
 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.570
dealing with that is you average it all
together and you get the mean and that's

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580
together and you get the mean and that's
 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.630
together and you get the mean and that's
what you study the outliers are viewed

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640
what you study the outliers are viewed
 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.700
what you study the outliers are viewed
as kind of a nuisance that adds variance

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710
as kind of a nuisance that adds variance
 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.889
as kind of a nuisance that adds variance
to the data but now we've begun to study

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899
to the data but now we've begun to study
 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.930
to the data but now we've begun to study
those previous nuisances and try to

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:37.940
those previous nuisances and try to
 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.450
those previous nuisances and try to
understand a little more about you know

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460
understand a little more about you know
 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.889
understand a little more about you know
what's really going on in terms of

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899
what's really going on in terms of
 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.889
what's really going on in terms of
pathological fear because almost all the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899
pathological fear because almost all the
 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.340
pathological fear because almost all the
the drugs that are developed to treat

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350
the drugs that are developed to treat
 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.750
the drugs that are developed to treat
fear and anxiety are developed on that

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
fear and anxiety are developed on that
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.810
fear and anxiety are developed on that
average animal rather than the extremes

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820
average animal rather than the extremes
 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.970
average animal rather than the extremes
but what we really need to understand I

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980
but what we really need to understand I
 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.560
but what we really need to understand I
think in the drug should be much more

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570
think in the drug should be much more
 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.150
think in the drug should be much more
effective and perhaps have fewer side

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160
effective and perhaps have fewer side
 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.280
effective and perhaps have fewer side
effects if they were targeted for the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290
effects if they were targeted for the
 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.860
effects if they were targeted for the
animals with the extreme fear so we're

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870
animals with the extreme fear so we're
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.309
animals with the extreme fear so we're
trying to come at the question of what

00:01:07.309 --> 00:01:07.319
trying to come at the question of what
 

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:10.639
trying to come at the question of what
causes animals to have this extreme fear

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649
causes animals to have this extreme fear
 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:12.770
causes animals to have this extreme fear
what pushes them out to the ends of the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
what pushes them out to the ends of the
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.599
what pushes them out to the ends of the
distribution the the basic idea is that

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:16.609
distribution the the basic idea is that
 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.160
distribution the the basic idea is that
yeah one way to do this would be to take

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170
yeah one way to do this would be to take
 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.080
yeah one way to do this would be to take
animals that that have the extremes

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
animals that that have the extremes
 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.639
animals that that have the extremes
period and then start breeding them and

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649
period and then start breeding them and
 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.459
period and then start breeding them and
create genetic lines that are that are

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469
create genetic lines that are that are
 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:28.099
create genetic lines that are that are
fearful but I think it's also

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.109
fearful but I think it's also
 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:30.830
fearful but I think it's also
interesting to ask given that it already

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
interesting to ask given that it already
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.080
interesting to ask given that it already
exists in the population of rats there's

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090
exists in the population of rats there's
 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.269
exists in the population of rats there's
extreme behaviors what can we learn

00:01:35.269 --> 00:01:35.279
extreme behaviors what can we learn
 

00:01:35.279 --> 00:01:39.889
extreme behaviors what can we learn
about so the pathophysiology of extreme

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899
about so the pathophysiology of extreme
 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.749
about so the pathophysiology of extreme
fear by studying those animals in other

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
fear by studying those animals in other
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.300
fear by studying those animals in other
words we don't have to start breeding

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310
words we don't have to start breeding
 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.230
words we don't have to start breeding
and creating genetic lines to get at

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240
and creating genetic lines to get at
 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.219
and creating genetic lines to get at
what's different because the difference

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229
what's different because the difference
 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.409
what's different because the difference
is already there we can compare animals

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:51.419
is already there we can compare animals
 

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:53.059
is already there we can compare animals
that are really afraid and those that

00:01:53.059 --> 00:01:53.069
that are really afraid and those that
 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.219
that are really afraid and those that
are not afraid and look in their brains

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229
are not afraid and look in their brains
 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.230
are not afraid and look in their brains
and see if they're Annie for example

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240
and see if they're Annie for example
 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.179
and see if they're Annie for example
structural differences in the amygdala

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189
structural differences in the amygdala
 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.069
structural differences in the amygdala
in terms of how the neurons what their

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079
in terms of how the neurons what their
 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.499
in terms of how the neurons what their
dendritic branches are what their axons

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509
dendritic branches are what their axons
 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.419
dendritic branches are what their axons
are like what kinds of molecules are

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429
are like what kinds of molecules are
 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.760
are like what kinds of molecules are
present in those neurons and to what

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770
present in those neurons and to what
 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.380
present in those neurons and to what
extent so we can get a lot of

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390
extent so we can get a lot of
 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.120
extent so we can get a lot of
information that might distinguish

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130
information that might distinguish
 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.590
information that might distinguish
fearful and

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600
fearful and
 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.230
fearful and
not so fearful rats that could provide

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240
not so fearful rats that could provide
 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.420
not so fearful rats that could provide
important clues as to what pushes them

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430
important clues as to what pushes them
 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.300
important clues as to what pushes them
out there towards the extremes but that

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310
out there towards the extremes but that
 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.860
out there towards the extremes but that
projects just beginning so we don't have

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870
projects just beginning so we don't have
 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.600
projects just beginning so we don't have
any answers but I think it's it's going

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610
any answers but I think it's it's going
 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.390
any answers but I think it's it's going
to be an important project
