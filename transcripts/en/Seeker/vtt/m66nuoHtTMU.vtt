This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Norton Security.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.290
you might get a surprise one as a kid or an
awful embarrassing ones as an adult.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.090
But what the heck causes nosebleeds?

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.179
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.020
60% of the population will experience epistaxis
EP EH STECK SIS or a nasal hemorrhage sometime

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.020
in their life.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.820
They’re embarrassing, messy, and fun fact:
in Japanese pop culture a sign of sexual arousal.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.720
So what happens when Mount Vesuvius erupts
on your face?

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.770
Well , your nose is filled with lots of blood
vessels with only a thin membrane to protect

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:33.770
them.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.010
Often this membrane gets torn or irritated.
and boom, your face is dripping with blood.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.600
there’s two kinds of nosebleeds, anterior
and posterior.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.870
Anterior nosebleeds are in the part of your
nose called Kiesselbach's triangle and are

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.539
triggered by an irritation to the lower nasal
septum, the thin membrane that separates your

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:50.539
nostrils.

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:51.949
Kids most often get this kind.

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.670
I think they spend too much time digging for
gold.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.640
More common in adults, posterior nosebleeds
originate further back and higher up in the

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.449
nose, to where arteries are.

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.330
Sometimes they can be severe enough to warrant
medical attention.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.480
So how do you get them?

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.690
Well the nose is in a vulnerable place, so
a bump or a punch might do some damage.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.900
Other than that common irritants include cold,
high altitude, dry air.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.330
Anything that dries out your nose leaves the
lower nasal septum vulnerable.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.790
A little scratch from a fingernail can start
the blood gushing.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.790
Although.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.010
spontaneous nosebleeds might be a sign of
hypertension or infection disease, or even

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.520
more rarely Vitamin C deficiency, anemia,
or heart failure.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.810
Those are common causes, what about more strange
ones you ask?

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.940
Recently it was reported that
A scottish backpacker who had just come back

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.830
from South Asia started to have frequent nosebleeds.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.170
After a few weeks, she went to see a doctor,
who thought it wasn’t serious and told her

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.170
just to go home.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.340
Then one night, she felt the blood clot move.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.630
Upon closer inspection she saw something with
ridges.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.382
A leech had lived in her nose for FOUR WEEKS.

00:01:52.382 --> 00:01:53.382
Another nasty nosebleed comes out of Saudi
Arabia.

00:01:53.382 --> 00:01:54.382
A 22 year old man reportedly kept getting
nosebleeds on and off for about three years.

00:01:54.382 --> 00:01:55.382
When he finally went to the doctor, they discovered
a tooth growing in his nasal cavity!

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:56.382
So how do you stop a nosebleed?

00:01:56.382 --> 00:01:59.400
Dr. Mary Pickett, an instructor in medicine
at Harvard Medical School says a pinch will

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.970
do the trick and you should treat all nosebleeds
like an anterior one.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.990
Pinch your nose halfway between the tip of
the nose and the bridge.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.270
Lean forward so the blood doesn’t drip down
your throat.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.910
Hold tight for five minutes.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.810
If that doesn’t do the trick, repeat.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.280
On rare occasions you might need to go to
the hospital.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.250
More complicated methods include cauterizing
the blood vessel using silver nitrate.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.760
Researchers from Detroit Medical Center won
an ig nobel prize in 2014 for using an old

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.900
school approach.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.400
The award celebrates silly and surprising
but practical research.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.240
The researchers couldn’t stop a young girl’s
nose bleed with traditional methods so they

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.280
tried salt pork.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.090
They say that "there are some clotting factors
in the pork ... and the high level of salt

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.360
will pull in a lot of fluid from the nose”.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.510
Unfortunately this might cause more harm than
good if its coated in bacteria so it’s not

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.230
recommended.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.560
So do you get nosebleeds?

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.560
How do you stop them?

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.910
Would ever use pork?

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.630
