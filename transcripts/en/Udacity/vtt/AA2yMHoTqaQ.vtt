00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.990
I'm Uta Francke, I'm a human geneticist

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.020
originally from Germany, as you can hear.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.860
And I'm an Emeritus Professor here at

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.950
Stanford and also senior medical director at 23andMe.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.840
&gt;&gt; So when people talk about variation in the human genome, we oftentimes.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.213
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:16.213 --> 00:00:20.140
&gt;&gt; Talk about single nucleotide variance, which we'll come to in, in later

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:25.374
lessons for, for our course. is that the main kind of variation that exists

00:00:25.374 --> 00:00:28.410
in the human genome, are these single letter differences? Or

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.770
are there other kinds of variation that are important too?

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.350
&gt;&gt; We have identified about 15 million single additive differences. So by

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.720
sheer number, they're the most common. But then there are other variants there

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.480
called copy number variations. But whole chunks of the genome can be

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.650
repeated, and they can be present in these, two or three or many copies.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.750
And there are differences between human beings,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.330
well some people have two copies, some have

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.708
five, some may have 12. And if you look at the total number of nucleoids

00:01:00.708 --> 00:01:01.470
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.570
than those, then this is more common. So the individual copy number variance, or

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.670
CNVs, are fewer than the ones that we have identified for SNVs. But,

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.240
if you look at the amount of genomic sequence, and what, in this

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.790
type of, what's called structural variation, it

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.350
involves the larger part of a genome.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.938
&gt;&gt; I see, so, between single nucleotide variance and copy number

00:01:26.938 --> 00:01:30.046
variation those are the two main kinds, or,

00:01:30.046 --> 00:01:32.830
the two main forms of variation in humans.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.540
&gt;&gt; Yeah, then there are others, like inversions, where certain pieces of

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.770
the genome can be turned around in some people, and not in others.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.800
&gt;&gt; And even, translocations? How viable are translocations, and do they get

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.900
propagated at all in a population over time, or most translocations inviable?

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.450
&gt;&gt; Well

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.970
we find them in families, you know, there are

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.460
balanced translocations where a piece of a chromosome is taken

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.700
off and hooked somewhere else, or two pieces have

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.620
been exchanged. And as long as they are balanced, meaning

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.940
that the right number of genes is there, people

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.729
are fine. They would know about it. Unless a break

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.590
is in a gene, but that's pretty unusual. A

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.330
break is most often in a repetitive sequence. But then,

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.100
when these people may have children, because

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.330
of what happens in meiosis, that the

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.920
chromosomes align and cross over. It's possible

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.470
that a child inherits a chromosome that only

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.620
has an extra copy and is then, gets the other one that's missing something. Then

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.520
you have an unbalanced translocation and that

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.380
can cause very bad developmental defects intellectual deficits.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.760
These are the children who we see in the clinic

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.520
and we look at their chromosomes. And look at their parents

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.920
and we see that translocation has been passed on to

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.510
several generations already. But otherwise, they don't last in, in populations.
