00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:42.275

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:45.779
And then that's like, what?

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:47.414 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Everything, yo

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:50.450

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.585
Hey, yo dick need to

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:54.120
Say it, nigga, say it.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.288
- Go ahead, tell 'em.

00:00:55.288 --> 00:00:56.456
You don't wanna tell 'em?

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:57.490 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Nah, man.
- It's a good idea.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.758
- It's stupid.
- He's saying,

00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:00.260 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then when you
walk up to the ride,

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.794 align:start size:94% position:6%
you should be like, yo
dick need to be this tall.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:02.028
(laughs)

00:01:02.028 --> 00:01:04.197
- You bein' stupid right
now, you bein' stupid.

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:05.131
Don't laugh at that.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:05.932
- What you mean I bein' stupid?

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:06.866
That's your idea, dog.

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.134
- I said, I said way more funny

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:09.369
things than that, man.
- He said, "Oh my god,

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:10.303
"I'm sorry, my dick
is only this tall,

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:10.837
"I cannot ride this ride."

00:01:10.837 --> 00:01:12.705
(laughs)

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:15.041 align:start size:97% position:3%
'Cause shit need to be funny
at the festival, though.

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:16.776
Shit should b funny
at the festival.

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:17.710
- You gotta take the
comedy up a notch.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.045
- If you take the com, what?

00:01:19.045 --> 00:01:20.246
- Yeah.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:22.148 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, man, like
the water slide, dog.

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:23.716 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Tsk, shh, you stupid.
- You know, like,

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:25.351
things that you can
do, like, it's good.

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.619
- Stupid.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:27.821
- But things you could
do to make it better,

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:28.822 align:start size:84% position:16%
like instead of
water, y'all should

00:01:28.822 --> 00:01:30.023 align:start size:88% position:13%
put champagne in there.
- Yeah.

00:01:30.023 --> 00:01:31.858 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So, a motherfucker
just get drunk,

00:01:31.858 --> 00:01:33.359
as he goin' down, like I be
goin' on the slide like this.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.463
Ah, and just get it
in my mouth, right?

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:38.565 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You put some, you put
some, uh, titties at the end.

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:41.201
- And then, yeah, like,
have one little slide,

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:42.836 align:start size:84% position:16%
and just have titties
at the bottom.

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:44.337
So, just the dudes
go down that one,

00:01:44.337 --> 00:01:45.972
and they go right
into the titties,

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:47.907
and then the other side,
like, you have a dick,

00:01:47.907 --> 00:01:49.476 align:start size:88% position:13%
and when the women come
down, they go blip,

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:50.443
right into the dick.

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:51.711
And they can go either way.

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:52.679 align:start size:94% position:6%
They come down like this,
(laughs)

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:53.580
or they can come down like this.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.281
See, put comedy into it.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:56.749
- You bein' stupid right now.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
- These are just the good ideas
that we be thinkin' about.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.086
What?

00:02:00.086 --> 00:02:01.488
- They need to, uh, get so you

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.022
get different bands,
same stage, same time.

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:04.257 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, man, there's
one problem, man.

00:02:04.257 --> 00:02:06.226
Like, they'll be like
six or seven bands

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:07.927 align:start size:88% position:13%
at the same time I
wanna be seein', right,

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:09.362
but they be at different stages.

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:11.331
What y'all should do, though,

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:13.066 align:start size:97% position:3%
what y'all should do though,
- For real.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:16.769
- Is have like six bands on the
same stage at the same time.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:17.937
That's what you
should do, right?

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:19.305 align:start size:84% position:16%
And then I wouldn't
miss no shows,

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:20.773
and like have, who
were you sayin',

00:02:20.773 --> 00:02:23.676
like Ludacris should
be playin' all of, um,

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:25.078
Radiohead's songs.

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:26.312
- Yeah.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:27.847
- And then, and
then, vice versa.

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:30.984 align:start size:94% position:6%
Or-or-or verse vica,
however you say that word.

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:31.818
You know what I mean?

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.052
- Basically.

00:02:33.052 --> 00:02:34.287 align:start size:81% position:19%
- That to me would
be a good idea.

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:35.688 align:start size:84% position:16%
Then you wouldn't
be missin' no bands.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.223
- Yo.

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:38.892
- It's like, it's like at a
seven and a half right now.

00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:40.326
I had to get loud so
you all would know

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:42.228
I'm tryin' to emphasize it.

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:43.730
- It's deep.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.031
- But you wanna take that
shit up to a 10 and a half.

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:45.965
- Gotta be specific.

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:48.735
- Psh, put more dicks in it.

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:51.571 align:start size:81% position:19%
It's like two plus
two equal five.

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:53.773
You know what I mean?

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:54.607
What, Mike?

00:02:54.607 --> 00:02:55.575
You say somethin'?

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:56.943
- Two plus two equal dick.

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:58.144
- Two plus two equal dick.

00:02:58.144 --> 00:02:59.379 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I'm just sayin',
though, I'm just sayin'.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.347 align:start size:88% position:13%
- See, already, you
can't even help it, man.

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:02.282
It can't make it's self up.

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:03.850
It can't make it's self up.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:04.684
You smell that?

00:03:04.684 --> 00:03:05.885
(sniffing)

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:07.120 align:start size:84% position:16%
Oh, we better get
some weed, right now.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.087
- It's all right,
it's all right.

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:09.088
- All right.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.659
So you know, you know
what I'm talkin' 'bout.

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.928
- Yo, bring that back.

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:16.529
- Nah, it's this way.

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:18.331
It's, (sniffing) it's this way.

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:19.933
- Bring that back.
