00:00:00.406 --> 00:00:02.255
- [Voiceover] So we saw in previous videos

00:00:02.255 --> 00:00:05.699
that a ball of mass m rotating in a circle

00:00:05.699 --> 00:00:08.224
of radius r at a speed v has

00:00:08.224 --> 00:00:10.449
what we call angular momentum,

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:11.282
and the symbol we use

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:14.221
for angular momentum is a capital L,

00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:15.889
and the amount of angular momentum

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.666
that it would have would be the mass

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.580
of the ball times the speed of the ball,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.274
so that means this is
basically just the magnitude

00:00:22.274 --> 00:00:24.401
of the momentum, but then we multiply

00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:27.063
by the radius of the
circle it's traveling in,

00:00:27.063 --> 00:00:29.186
and that gives us the angular momentum

00:00:29.186 --> 00:00:30.944
of this ball going in a circle,

00:00:30.944 --> 00:00:32.837
which is great and good to know,

00:00:32.837 --> 00:00:34.809
but sometimes you don't have a ball going

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.644
in a circle and you wanna
know the angular momentum.

00:00:37.644 --> 00:00:40.000
So, for instance, instead of this case,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.408
let's say you have this case,

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:42.776
where instead of a ball going around

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:45.814
in a circle, you've got a rod of mass m

00:00:45.814 --> 00:00:48.757
and radius R and the whole rod rotates

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.196
around in a circle.

00:00:50.196 --> 00:00:52.913
Let's say the outside
edge travels at a speed v

00:00:52.913 --> 00:00:54.445
just like the ball did.

00:00:54.445 --> 00:00:55.278
So the question is,

00:00:55.278 --> 00:00:58.091
will this rod also have
an angular momentum

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:00.647
that's equal to mvR and it won't.

00:01:00.647 --> 00:01:01.949
You can probably convince yourself of that

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.368
because for the ball all
the mass was traveling

00:01:04.368 --> 00:01:06.856
at a speed v and all the mass was

00:01:06.856 --> 00:01:09.259
at the outside edge of the
circle that it traces out.

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.918
In other words, all this mass is traveling

00:01:11.918 --> 00:01:13.652
at a radius of R.

00:01:13.652 --> 00:01:16.241
But for this rod, some
of the mass, in fact,

00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:18.879
only part of the mass,
only this outside edge

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:22.303
of the mass, is actually
traveling at a radius R.

00:01:22.303 --> 00:01:25.539
That's the part that travels
at the full radius R.

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.345
The rest of these pieces of
mass, like this one in here,

00:01:28.345 --> 00:01:29.890
traces out a circle.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.695
It definitely traces out a circle,

00:01:31.695 --> 00:01:33.814
but the circle it traces out is not equal

00:01:33.814 --> 00:01:35.195
to the radius R.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:37.002
It's got a diminished R value.

00:01:37.002 --> 00:01:39.418
So how do we determine
the angular momentum

00:01:39.418 --> 00:01:42.651
of an object whose mass
is distributed in a way

00:01:42.651 --> 00:01:44.795
that some of the mass is close to the axis

00:01:44.795 --> 00:01:47.277
and some of the mass is
far away from the axis.

00:01:47.277 --> 00:01:48.912
That's what we're gonna do in this video.

00:01:48.912 --> 00:01:51.344
That's the goal and the
approach physicists take

00:01:51.344 --> 00:01:53.778
to this is almost always the same.

00:01:53.778 --> 00:01:55.648
We say, well, I've got the formula

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:58.269
for the angular momentum
of a single particle

00:01:58.269 --> 00:01:59.662
traveling at a single radius,

00:01:59.662 --> 00:02:02.758
so let's just imagine
our continuous object

00:02:02.758 --> 00:02:06.292
being composed of a bunch of single masses

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.974
all traveling at a single radius.

00:02:08.974 --> 00:02:10.994
So if I break this continuous mass up

00:02:10.994 --> 00:02:13.258
into individual pieces, right?

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:14.816
So if I imagine it being broken up

00:02:14.816 --> 00:02:16.682
into all these little pieces,

00:02:16.682 --> 00:02:19.729
then if I found the angular
momentum of each piece

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:22.976
and added it up, I'd get
the total angular momentum

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.401
for the whole object.

00:02:24.401 --> 00:02:25.704
So let's try this.

00:02:25.704 --> 00:02:28.875
So the angular momentum of
some piece of the object,

00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:30.337
let's say that little piece of mass,

00:02:30.337 --> 00:02:33.151
is gonna be, well the
mass of that little piece,

00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:34.539
I'm gonna write m.

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:37.659
It's not the entire
mass of this entire rod,

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:40.630
it'd just be the mass of that
small piece times the speed

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.147
of that piece times the
radius that it is at.

00:02:44.147 --> 00:02:45.517
So to make this clear,
let me just write this as

00:02:45.517 --> 00:02:49.350
like piece one, so this
would be m1, v1 and R1

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.653
and this would be the angular momentum

00:02:53.653 --> 00:02:55.557
of that small piece, and you could do this

00:02:55.557 --> 00:02:58.473
for mass two over here, and you would get

00:02:58.473 --> 00:02:59.380
that the angular momentum

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.297
of mass two would be m2, v2 and R2.

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.190
Now keep in mind that these
v's are all gonna be different

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.519
so the speed out here

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.518
at the outside edge is gonna be fastest.

00:03:11.518 --> 00:03:13.644
This speed's not gonna be as great,

00:03:13.644 --> 00:03:16.526
and this speed closer to
the middle is even smaller

00:03:16.526 --> 00:03:18.709
because they're tracing
out smaller circles

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.024
in the same amount of time

00:03:20.024 --> 00:03:23.557
as these outside pieces
trace out larger circles

00:03:23.557 --> 00:03:24.859
in the same amount of time.

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.246
So at this point, you might be worried.

00:03:26.246 --> 00:03:28.054
You might be like, "This
is gonna be really hard.

00:03:28.054 --> 00:03:29.408
We're gonna have to add all these up.

00:03:29.408 --> 00:03:31.008
They've all got different speeds.

00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:32.636
They're all at different radii.

00:03:32.636 --> 00:03:33.897
How are we gonna do this?"

00:03:33.897 --> 00:03:35.248
Well, you gotta have faith

00:03:35.248 --> 00:03:37.769
and something magical is about to happen.

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:38.702
So let me show you what happens

00:03:38.702 --> 00:03:40.963
if we imagine adding all these up.

00:03:40.963 --> 00:03:42.218
I only draw two.

00:03:42.218 --> 00:03:44.153
You gotta imagine there's
an infinite amount

00:03:44.153 --> 00:03:45.914
of these so that makes
it seem even harder,

00:03:45.914 --> 00:03:48.808
but imagine breaking this
up into an infinite amount

00:03:48.808 --> 00:03:50.719
of these little discrete masses

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:54.036
and considering each
individual angular momentum,

00:03:54.036 --> 00:03:56.277
they'd be very small
because this m1 would be

00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:59.654
an infinitesimal very small piece of mass,

00:03:59.654 --> 00:04:02.072
and let's add them all
up and see what we get.

00:04:02.072 --> 00:04:05.989
So if we add up all of
the mvR's of every piece

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.527
of mass on this rod, that would be

00:04:09.527 --> 00:04:12.937
the total angular momentum of the rod.

00:04:12.937 --> 00:04:14.252
So in other words, this is really

00:04:14.252 --> 00:04:17.919
just m1, v1, R1 m2, v2, R2 and so on.

00:04:22.568 --> 00:04:24.122
You'd have an infinite
amount of them, right?

00:04:24.122 --> 00:04:24.955
I can't write them all out

00:04:24.955 --> 00:04:25.983
'cause there's an infinite amount.

00:04:25.983 --> 00:04:27.190
But just imagine that.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.210
So what can we possibly do with this?

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.076
How do we clean this up?

00:04:31.076 --> 00:04:32.575
When you're doing a physics problem,

00:04:32.575 --> 00:04:34.785
you don't want to solve an infinite series

00:04:34.785 --> 00:04:36.509
by writing each term out infinitely.

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.054
We want a clever way to deal with this,

00:04:38.054 --> 00:04:40.479
and there's a really clever
way to deal with this.

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:41.312
Watch this.

00:04:41.312 --> 00:04:44.883
So if we write this as
L equals the sum of mvR.

00:04:44.883 --> 00:04:48.917
One problem we have is that
each mass has a different v.

00:04:48.917 --> 00:04:51.567
If I can pull things
out of this summation,

00:04:51.567 --> 00:04:53.819
it would help me out 'cause
it would simplify things.

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:55.031
I could just factor them out,

00:04:55.031 --> 00:04:57.520
but right now I can't factor out the R,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.446
'cause these all are
different radii from the axis.

00:05:00.446 --> 00:05:03.150
You always measure your
radius from the axis here,

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.308
and they're all at different
radii from the axis,

00:05:05.308 --> 00:05:06.982
and they all have different speeds.

00:05:06.982 --> 00:05:09.708
But, remember, we like
writing quantities in terms

00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:13.426
of angular variables because
the angular variables

00:05:13.426 --> 00:05:16.063
are the same for every point on this mass.

00:05:16.063 --> 00:05:20.230
So every point on this rotating
rod has a different speed v

00:05:21.331 --> 00:05:24.711
but they all have the
same angular speed omega,

00:05:24.711 --> 00:05:25.836
so that's a key.

00:05:25.836 --> 00:05:27.890
That's often what we do and
we're gonna do that here.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:30.609
I'm gonna write this as summation of m,

00:05:30.609 --> 00:05:32.872
but instead of writing
v, I'm gonna write this

00:05:32.872 --> 00:05:34.739
as R times omega.

00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:38.229
So, remember, for something
rotating in the circle,

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.634
the speed v is gonna be
equal to R times omega

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.393
and that's what I'm gonna
substitute down here,

00:05:44.393 --> 00:05:47.070
so the speed at any
point here is the radii

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.601
of that point times the angular speed

00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:51.819
of this rod rotating in a circle,

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:54.112
and I still have to
multiply by the last R here,

00:05:54.112 --> 00:05:55.163
so this was v.

00:05:55.163 --> 00:05:57.599
We substituted in what v
was, but we have to multiply

00:05:57.599 --> 00:05:59.762
by R and what do we get?

00:05:59.762 --> 00:06:02.244
We get that L is gonna be the summation

00:06:02.244 --> 00:06:03.911
of mR squared omega.

00:06:05.402 --> 00:06:06.544
And this is great.

00:06:06.544 --> 00:06:09.921
The omega is the same for
every single mass in here.

00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:12.939
Every single mass travels
at the same angular speed,

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:15.911
so we could factor this
out of the summation.

00:06:15.911 --> 00:06:18.375
Imagine all these terms
would have an omega.

00:06:18.375 --> 00:06:20.266
We can factor that out,
and I could just bring that

00:06:20.266 --> 00:06:22.134
outside of the summation.

00:06:22.134 --> 00:06:25.803
So I'll write this as the
summation of mR squared,

00:06:25.803 --> 00:06:28.285
and to make this clear, I'm
gonna put parentheses here.

00:06:28.285 --> 00:06:31.749
It's that summation and then
that whole thing times omega,

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:33.805
'cause we're just factoring out omega.

00:06:33.805 --> 00:06:35.086
And you might not be impressed.

00:06:35.086 --> 00:06:36.385
You might be like, "All right.

00:06:36.385 --> 00:06:37.218
Big deal.

00:06:37.218 --> 00:06:39.481
We've still got an infinite sum in here.

00:06:39.481 --> 00:06:40.782
What the heck am I gonna do with that?"

00:06:40.782 --> 00:06:42.772
You don't have to do anything with that.

00:06:42.772 --> 00:06:44.017
This is where the magic happens.

00:06:44.017 --> 00:06:45.685
Look at what sum you've got.

00:06:45.685 --> 00:06:48.555
You've got the sum of all the mR squareds.

00:06:48.555 --> 00:06:50.310
Remember what mR squared was?

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.899
Mr squared was the moment
of inertia of a point mass,

00:06:53.899 --> 00:06:57.096
and if I add up all the mR
squareds, I get the moment

00:06:57.096 --> 00:07:00.574
of inertia of the entire
mass, this entire object.

00:07:00.574 --> 00:07:02.420
I get its total moment of inertia.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.496
So what we found was a really handy way

00:07:05.496 --> 00:07:07.691
to write the angular
momentum of an object.

00:07:07.691 --> 00:07:11.457
It's just the moment of
inertia of an object, I,

00:07:11.457 --> 00:07:15.262
times the angular speed of that object.

00:07:15.262 --> 00:07:17.259
So this is a great formula,

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:19.640
and it totally makes
sense for this reason.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.403
Think about regular momentum, right.

00:07:21.403 --> 00:07:25.494
Regular momentum, p, was just equal to mv.

00:07:25.494 --> 00:07:28.404
Well, if you then told me,
"Determine the angular momentum,"

00:07:28.404 --> 00:07:30.274
and I didn't wanna go
through this derivation,

00:07:30.274 --> 00:07:31.176
I mighta just been like,

00:07:31.176 --> 00:07:33.935
"All right, angular momentum, shoot."

00:07:33.935 --> 00:07:37.678
Well, I'm just gonna replace
mass with angular mass,

00:07:37.678 --> 00:07:39.888
and angular mass, the angular inertia,

00:07:39.888 --> 00:07:41.432
is just the moment of inertia,

00:07:41.432 --> 00:07:44.914
and I'll just replace the
speed with the angular speed,

00:07:44.914 --> 00:07:46.505
and look, I just get this formula.

00:07:46.505 --> 00:07:47.782
So it makes sense because

00:07:47.782 --> 00:07:49.675
if you replace all the linear quantities

00:07:49.675 --> 00:07:51.656
with their angular counterpart,

00:07:51.656 --> 00:07:54.088
you indeed just get the angular momentum

00:07:54.088 --> 00:07:55.836
of a rotating object.

00:07:55.836 --> 00:07:56.707
So this is how you do it.

00:07:56.707 --> 00:07:58.776
If you've got an object,
an extended object

00:07:58.776 --> 00:08:02.318
where the mass is distributed
about the entire object,

00:08:02.318 --> 00:08:03.659
if you just take the moment of inertia

00:08:03.659 --> 00:08:06.436
of that object and multiply
by its angular speed,

00:08:06.436 --> 00:08:08.233
you get its angular momentum.

00:08:08.233 --> 00:08:10.667
So, for instance, if this rod has a mass

00:08:10.667 --> 00:08:13.156
of let's say three kilograms,

00:08:13.156 --> 00:08:14.985
and that mass is evenly distributed.

00:08:14.985 --> 00:08:17.807
Let's say the radius of
this object is two meters.

00:08:17.807 --> 00:08:21.193
So that's the distance from
the axis to the outside edge.

00:08:21.193 --> 00:08:24.189
And let's say the angular
speed of this object was,

00:08:24.189 --> 00:08:27.207
let's say 10 radians per second,

00:08:27.207 --> 00:08:30.430
we can figure out the
angular momentum of this rod

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.889
by saying that the angular
momentum is gonna equal

00:08:32.889 --> 00:08:34.676
the moment of inertia.

00:08:34.676 --> 00:08:36.057
Well the moment of inertia of a rod

00:08:36.057 --> 00:08:40.767
about one end is equal to 1/3 mL squared.

00:08:40.767 --> 00:08:43.128
That's the moment of inertia
of a rod about the end,

00:08:43.128 --> 00:08:47.076
and I then multiply by the
angular speed of the object.

00:08:47.076 --> 00:08:49.014
So if I plug in numbers,
I get the angular momentum

00:08:49.014 --> 00:08:51.479
of this rod is gonna be,
I'll use purple here,

00:08:51.479 --> 00:08:55.969
1/3 times three kilograms times the length

00:08:55.969 --> 00:08:57.750
of the object was two meters,

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.683
and we square that, and then we multiply

00:08:59.683 --> 00:09:03.250
by the angular speed and that
was 10 radians per second,

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:05.047
which give us an angular momentum

00:09:05.047 --> 00:09:08.464
of 40 kilogram meters squared per second.

00:09:09.517 --> 00:09:11.575
So recapping, if you've got a point mass

00:09:11.575 --> 00:09:13.875
where all the mass
rotates at the same radius

00:09:13.875 --> 00:09:16.038
and you wanna find the angular momentum,

00:09:16.038 --> 00:09:17.517
the easiest way to get it is probably

00:09:17.517 --> 00:09:19.408
with the formula mvR.

00:09:19.408 --> 00:09:22.722
However, if you have a mass
whose mass is distributed

00:09:22.722 --> 00:09:25.319
throughout the object
so that different points

00:09:25.319 --> 00:09:27.826
on the object are at different radii,

00:09:27.826 --> 00:09:30.144
the easiest way to get
the angular momentum

00:09:30.144 --> 00:09:31.827
of that object is most likely

00:09:31.827 --> 00:09:34.309
with the formula I omega,

00:09:34.309 --> 00:09:35.324
where I is the moment

00:09:35.324 --> 00:09:36.673
of inertia of the object

00:09:36.673 --> 00:09:39.496
and omega is the angular
velocity of the object.
