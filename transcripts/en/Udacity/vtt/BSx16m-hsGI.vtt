00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And a point for a student who did better in high school

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
than in college would be below the line.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So you can see here,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
someone in the extreme case,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
someone with a college GPA of 0,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
could have any high school GPA

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and would still be below the line,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
But as the college GPA gets higher,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
their high school GPA must be at least equal

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to the college one to fall into that region.

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And so that is the answer, below the line.
