00:00:00.604 --> 00:00:01.718
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians!

00:00:01.718 --> 00:00:03.158
Today we're talking about another kind

00:00:03.158 --> 00:00:04.806
of irregular plural noun,

00:00:04.806 --> 00:00:06.989
and that is the foreign plural.

00:00:06.989 --> 00:00:09.752
Those are words that are
borrowed into English

00:00:09.752 --> 00:00:11.238
from some other language.

00:00:11.238 --> 00:00:14.790
Words like fungus, or cactus,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.530
or thesis, or criteria.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.666
And these words come from Latin

00:00:19.666 --> 00:00:21.779
and Greek, respectively,

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.637
but don't get the idea
that you need to learn

00:00:23.637 --> 00:00:25.773
to be able to speak Latin or Greek

00:00:25.773 --> 00:00:26.980
in order to speak English.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.747
No, not at all.

00:00:27.747 --> 00:00:29.767
But while some words that
got borrowed into English

00:00:29.767 --> 00:00:34.016
have lost their language-specific plurals,

00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:35.525
some have not.

00:00:35.525 --> 00:00:37.545
Some have maintained those plurals.

00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:40.192
And it kind of depends on which situation

00:00:40.192 --> 00:00:41.423
you're using them in.

00:00:41.423 --> 00:00:44.511
So, for example, in an informal context,

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:45.765
it would be perfectly acceptable

00:00:45.765 --> 00:00:49.271
for you or me to say funguses, like that.

00:00:49.271 --> 00:00:51.732
But if I was talking to a biologist,

00:00:51.732 --> 00:00:54.030
she would probably say fungi

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.628
if she were talking about
them in a scientific context.

00:00:58.628 --> 00:01:00.601
Just like it's okay in informal speech

00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:02.273
to talk about cactuses.

00:01:02.273 --> 00:01:03.666
You're driving along a road in Arizona,

00:01:03.666 --> 00:01:05.036
you see a lot of cactuses.

00:01:05.036 --> 00:01:08.403
But, again, if you studied
cactuses for a living,

00:01:08.403 --> 00:01:11.166
you would probably call them cacti.

00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:13.233
It's more precise, it's more formal.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:15.763
If you like, it's more polite.

00:01:15.763 --> 00:01:19.063
Now, my feeling is, that
as fungus and cactus

00:01:19.063 --> 00:01:22.174
get more and more entrenched into English

00:01:22.174 --> 00:01:26.331
eventually these formal
endings are going to fall away

00:01:26.331 --> 00:01:28.513
and we're just gonna
have this regular plural.

00:01:28.513 --> 00:01:31.671
But for now there are still
some pluralizing rules

00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:34.875
for other languages that it helps to know.

00:01:34.875 --> 00:01:36.338
So let's go through those.

00:01:36.338 --> 00:01:37.685
So I made this little chart to go over

00:01:37.685 --> 00:01:42.305
the six most common Latin
and Greek irregular plurals

00:01:42.305 --> 00:01:44.581
that you're going to encounter in English.

00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:47.953
So the first one is final -a to final -ae.

00:01:47.953 --> 00:01:50.670
So you take a word like
larva in the singular,

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.039
which is like a little baby bug,

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.895
like an ant larva, or a caterpillar larva,

00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:57.426
and the traditional irregular plural,

00:01:57.426 --> 00:02:00.886
the Latin plural of that, is larvae, -ae.

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:03.092
But the regular plural
that will probably get

00:02:03.092 --> 00:02:06.668
more popular over time is larvas.

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:09.208
But this is the first one, -a to -ae.

00:02:09.208 --> 00:02:10.763
Larva to larvae.

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:14.525
Just like antenna becomes antennae.

00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:18.674
Secondly the ending change
from final -us to final -i,

00:02:18.674 --> 00:02:21.762
which we find in a word like
fungus, is the singular,

00:02:21.762 --> 00:02:26.336
and then the irregular
plural of that is fungi.

00:02:26.336 --> 00:02:28.379
And, as I said before,
there are some people

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.632
who use funguses, but
again, that regular plural

00:02:30.632 --> 00:02:34.718
is more informal.

00:02:34.718 --> 00:02:36.715
This next one is also Latin

00:02:36.715 --> 00:02:39.748
and it's the change from
final -um to final -a.

00:02:39.748 --> 00:02:42.720
So we take a word like
datum, which is a single unit

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.365
of data, so the plural of data,

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:49.987
so we change singular datum to plural data

00:02:49.987 --> 00:02:53.029
and there is no accepted,
you wouldn't say the datas,

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:55.560
that is not an accepted regular plural.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.603
I think what's going to
happen instead is that datum

00:02:57.603 --> 00:02:58.903
is gonna fall away.

00:02:58.903 --> 00:03:01.295
But, again, it hasn't really happened yet.

00:03:01.295 --> 00:03:05.823
Not in a formal context, anyway.

00:03:05.823 --> 00:03:10.823
This next one is also Latin,
and it's final -ex or final -ix

00:03:10.838 --> 00:03:13.345
to final -ices.

00:03:13.345 --> 00:03:17.617
So if you take a word
like index, or matrix,

00:03:17.617 --> 00:03:22.099
the plural of that is
not indexes, but indices.

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.441
Indexes is, again, the
informal regular plural,

00:03:26.441 --> 00:03:29.831
but indices is the more
formal irregular plural.

00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:32.106
Likewise, matrices.

00:03:32.106 --> 00:03:33.964
This one is Greek and it's the change

00:03:33.964 --> 00:03:38.724
from final -is to final
-es, as in the word thesis

00:03:38.724 --> 00:03:43.251
in the singular becoming
theses in the irregular plural.

00:03:43.251 --> 00:03:46.061
The regular plural of
this I do not care for

00:03:46.061 --> 00:03:50.054
because it is thesises, and
I think that sounds silly.

00:03:50.054 --> 00:03:52.051
But thinking something
is silly is no reason

00:03:52.051 --> 00:03:54.791
to stand athwart the tide
of linguistic change,

00:03:54.791 --> 00:03:56.370
grumble grumble.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.994
This last one is also Greek,
and it's the change from

00:03:58.994 --> 00:04:01.385
singular -on to plural -a.

00:04:01.385 --> 00:04:06.063
So we this word like
criterion, or phenomenon,

00:04:06.063 --> 00:04:10.954
and in the plural it is
criteria or phenomena.

00:04:10.954 --> 00:04:13.029
(singing) Do do do do do.

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:14.956
And as with datum, there isn't really

00:04:14.956 --> 00:04:18.369
a regular plural form for criteria.

00:04:18.369 --> 00:04:20.894
Nobody says criterions,
because the word criteria

00:04:20.894 --> 00:04:23.076
is so much better known.

00:04:23.076 --> 00:04:27.093
Anyway, so these are
six little ending rules,

00:04:27.093 --> 00:04:30.065
but, like I said, you don't
need to learn Latin or Greek

00:04:30.065 --> 00:04:32.039
in order to make sense of English.

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.546
But having these six
rules in your tool belt,

00:04:34.546 --> 00:04:36.566
if you use them judiciously,

00:04:36.566 --> 00:04:38.238
will probably come in handy.

00:04:38.238 --> 00:04:40.560
But, for real, if you see
a word and you don't know

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.300
it's derivation, just trust your instincts

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.041
and give it a regular plural.

00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:46.690
Just tack on an -s.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.710
You know, the world's not gonna end,

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.544
not harm will come to you.

00:04:50.544 --> 00:04:53.191
And if you're curious,
you can look it up later.

00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:54.817
You can learn anything.

00:04:54.817 --> 00:04:56.078
David out.
