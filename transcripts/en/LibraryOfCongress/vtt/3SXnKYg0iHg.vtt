I'm John Parrish Peede,

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.160
Chairman of the National
Endowment for the Humanities.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.420
NEH is proud to sponsor this
year's Understanding Our

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.240
World stage.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.150
Our agency is an
independent federal agency,

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.850
we were established in 1965.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.060
We are part of LBJ's
great society legislation,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.940
and we still continue
that charge today

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.540
with our sister agency the NEA.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.050
The NEH supports museum
exhibitions, documentaries,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.640
books that bring history,
literature, philosophy,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.650
archaeology and the other
humanities fields to the public.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.940
We also fund the preservation
of historic records,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.970
collections and objects.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.110
We sponsor educational
opportunities for K-12 teachers

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.260
and students in the humanities.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.180
We also underwrite fundamental
research across the discipline

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.450
in the humanities that
includes university professors

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.620
or independent scholars.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.790
And I must say what a special
panel this is, our next author

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.830
on this stage is a
celebrated journalist

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.970
and nonfiction author
Mark Bowden.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.850
And what I would say

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.550
and I should say Mark will be
signing books from 12:30 to 1:30

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.760
and you know a good
bit about him

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.700
and our moderator
will tell you more.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.920
Mark of course is a
distinguished journalist,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.920
many of you read
him in the Atlantic.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.210
And he's the author of 13
books on topics ranging

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.510
from the Iran hostage crisis
to the hunt for Pablo Escobar

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.080
to the killing of
Osama bin Laden.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.460
And what I, and of course you
know him for Black Hawk Down

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.780
and we're here to talk
about his new book,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.480
which we'll hear about today.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.440
I might take a moment
to tell you something

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.770
that wouldn't be in the bio.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.760
I had the honor and
pleasure when I worked

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.110
at the National Endowment for
the Arts from about 15 years ago

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.540
to about 7 or 8 years ago
to lead writing workshops

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.530
in Afghanistan, Kirgizstan
on a domestic basis.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.670
And we wanted to get some
of our nation's veterans

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.830
who are writers, as well as
journalists to help troops talk

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.240
about their wartime
experiences, to teach them a bit

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.360
about the craft of writing, and
to help them if they wished to,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.270
to unlock those cathartic
experiences.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.230
And I must say that Mark
was a tireless part of that,

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.320
he was part of our
documentary Muse of Fire.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.870
He is the father of
a veteran himself.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.430
And when all the cameras went
off and there aren't a bunch

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.020
of people in the room
but there's just seven

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.620
or eight veterans on a base
in California who showed

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.880
up to hear a little bit
about him, maybe wanting

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.510
to meet a famous writer but
also quietly maybe wanting

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.910
to tell their story, this
gentleman gave of his time,

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.050
sacrificed his time, and
was really present to them.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.510
So I think that should
be acknowledged here too.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.040
[ Applause ]

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.290
So and of course, when you
look at who's praising his work

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.970
so many times is the military
veterans and he does indeed go

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.330
as a journalist directly
to the source.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.140
And to talk a little
bit more about Hue 1968,

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.600
The Turning Point
of the American War

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.250
in Vietnam Mark is joined
by a remarkable person,

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.650
a remarkable journalist
to interview him.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.230
Carlos Lozada is a
nonfiction book critic

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.810
for the Washington Post.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.950
Carlos was a finalist
for the Pulitzer Prize

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.900
in criticism in 2018.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.090
So please join me
in welcoming them

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.890
and thanking them
for being here.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:41.450
[ Applause ]

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.540
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: So it
is a huge pleasure for me

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.710
to be sitting here with Mark.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.190
I'll try not to be too much of
a fan boy and keep it together.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.290
But I've been reading the
Atlantic for a long time

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.270
and of course we know him as
the author of landmark works

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.790
that you've read or seen
taken to the screen,

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.670
such as Black Hawk
Down, Killing Pablo,

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.770
and most recently Hue
1968, A Turning Point

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.690
in the American War in
Vietnam on one of the bloodiest

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.240
or perhaps the bloodiest
battle of the war.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.490
Before we get into this I'll
just emphasize as was noted,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.390
Mark will be signing
books from 12:30 to 1:30.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.150
Also, will be plenty of
time for questions for you.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.730
I have a few myself, but
then we'll turn it over.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.030
And there's two mics here,

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.800
so you can come up
and ask questions.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.750
And it's all being
recorded, so you know be

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.050
on your best behavior.

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.300
And I guess just to
start off very broadly,

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:47.480
aside from the appeal of a 50th
anniversary, why did you decide

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.750
to write about Vietnam now and
in particular about this battle?

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:55.760
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Well the easy
answer to the question is

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.150
that my publisher ever
since Black Hawk Down was

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.560
such a success had been after
me to write another book

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.240
about a battle for
about 15 years,

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.080
and I kept telling him no.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.240
But he urged this idea on me
and I started to read about it,

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.590
and learned a number of things.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.350
I learned as you said that
it was easily the largest

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.320
and bloodiest single
battle fought in the war.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.320
Very uncharacteristic of most
of the war fighting in Vietnam

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.690
and that it was fought
in this big city.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.610
And I think that the
significance of the event,

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.430
which was I think the
largest single part

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:36.940
of the Tet Offensive gave me an
opportunity in a way to write

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.950
about the whole Vietnam War.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.740
And you know my preferred
way of telling stories is not

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.610
to write sweeping histories,

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.410
but rather to find a
very dramatic moment.

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.280
And I think if you dig
deeply enough into an event

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.260
like the Battle of Hue you
see all the currents that were

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.450
in play in the war in Vietnam.

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:00.450
And it gives you a much
deeper understanding

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.790
of the whole event.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:06.560
So I saw that it was, you know,
I think of more importance

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.270
that I understood, and also saw

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.420
that no one had really
done it well.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.350
And the last thing is that
because Vietnam has opened

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.130
up so much in recent years it
afforded me the opportunity

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.180
that previous journalists
and historians didn't have,

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.030
which is to go to Vietnam
and to research there,

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:28.640
to tell the story
through the eyes

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.550
of both Americans
and Vietnamese.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.860
So for all those reasons
I decided to do it.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.810
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: You know so
much of the great literature

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.840
of Vietnam and of America's
wars in general tend to focus

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.490
on the American side of the war,

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.700
how Americans were
marked by the experience.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:51.560
You make an effort in this book

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.870
to chronicle the other
side of this war.

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:01.130
What specifically did you
learn about the Vietnamese

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.420
in the course of this reporting
and what were the challenges

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.100
of reporting and writing
that side of the story?

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.940
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Well
I learned a lot,

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.770
I mean I think my understanding

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:15.440
of Vietnam was pretty
near the zero mark.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:21.040
The time I spent in Vietnam
taught me a lot of history

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:25.650
and impressed me with the
determination of so many

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.720
of the Vietnamese
veterans I interviewed

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.820
to become an independent
country.

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.390
I don't think I met too many
doctrinaire communists I met

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:38.770
people who felt they
were fighting

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.650
for the freedom of
their country.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.120
So I mean that impressed
me in that sense, you know,

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.670
they were perfectly decent noble
people doing what they thought

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:54.500
was the best for themselves
and for their country.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.120
I learned that the Vietnamese
side which prevailed in the war

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.870
in the long run made a
lot of terrible mistakes

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.500
in the same way that America
made a lot of terrible mistakes.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.580
In the Battle of Hue they
had incorrectly anticipated

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.530
that the people of the city
would rise up in support

00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.230
when the troops came and
none of that happened.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:19.700
And as a consequence, I think a
lot of the frustration and anger

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.350
that the Vietnamese troops had
was directed toward civilians.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:26.250
So there were terrible
purges of civilians

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.660
which took place while the
city was in communist hands.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:32.950
So all those things, you know,

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:37.110
it's always harder doing the
reporting in another country

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.780
where you don't speak
the language.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.110
If you hire somebody who is
skilled which I was fortunate

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.620
to do, a fellow named Ho
Dang Hua [assumed spelling]

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.840
who also worked with
Ken Burns in his series

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:51.130
as a retired military
officer who knew his way

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.860
around the veterans'
organizations and government

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.900
in Hanoi, so Hua was
invaluable to me.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:01.190
But the experience of
interviewing someone

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.190
in another language
is disconcerting

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.250
because you ask a question

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.830
and someone will give
you a 20-minute answer

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.840
and your interpreter will
give you a 30-second summary.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:15.290
So, but I recorded all these
interviews and it wasn't

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.630
until I came home, I hired a
young woman at the University

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:23.370
of Delaware Xuyen Dinh who
translated, transcribed

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:24.870
and translated all
of those Vietnam.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:26.170
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: Verbatim?

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:27.470
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Yes.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:28.770
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: Okay.

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.070
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: And so
sometimes you know it wasn't

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.550
until months later that I really
learned you know the details

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:34.260
of what I had been told.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.430
And Xuyen was also, she's
from Ho Chi Minh City,

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:41.620
she was a terrific kind of
cultural counselor for me.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:44.850
I mean she would explain
things that I didn't understand

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.770
and what people were telling
me, so she was invaluable.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.290
And so like anything
else you know

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:53.720
if you don't know what you're
doing find people who do.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.130
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: So this
is a little shop talking

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:02.220
and navel-gazing
for journalists.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:06.540
But how is the story of this
sort of fierce you know 24,

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.710
25-day battle told at the time?

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:12.670
What do you make of the,
you know, of the journalism

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:16.260
of that era and being
able to tell the story

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.620
that you've uncovered now?

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.200
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Yeah.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.230
I think you know is one
of the things that I wrote

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:25.420
about in the book and
I was so impressed

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:30.220
with how skillfully American
reporters who arrived,

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:34.920
who begin arriving very soon
after the battle began sized

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:40.610
up what was happening I think
with remarkable accuracy,

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:44.410
and put themselves at
great risk to do so.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.810
So impressed with it and in
fact you know one of the things

00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:50.190
that I make a point of in the
book is that the official count

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.880
of what was going
on in Hue was wrong

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.650
in just about every respect.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.640
That the generals
and the White House

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.420
and the Pentagon were frankly
lying to the American people,

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:06.230
and it was only the reporters
and photographers on the ground

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:10.110
who were communicating to
American audiences the reality

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.680
of what was going on there.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.100
So it was a striking example
to me of the importance

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.980
of an independent press.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.970
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: And
how quickly did that sort

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:26.440
of unofficial more
accurate version begin

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:31.160
to have a real political
impact back here?

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.600
You know, I mean
Johnson announced shortly

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.390
after Tet right that
he wasn't going to run.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:38.690
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Right.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:39.990
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: And you
know Cronkite covered this.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.860
You know how did that
filter back how quickly

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.420
and how accurately?

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.630
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Well it had a
tremendous impact and I think

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.380
that the Johnson administration

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:54.080
and General Westmoreland had
set themselves up for a fall

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.610
by being overly optimistic
in their estimates

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:59.590
of what was happening
in Vietnam,

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:03.130
and how successful the
American effort had been.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.250
I think the Tet Offensive
as a whole,

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:10.890
which was very widely reported
in some cases inaccurately

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:14.680
but for the most part I
think pretty on the money,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:19.700
captured just the gap between
the official version of events

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.000
and what was going on.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.680
I mean literally Walter Cronkite
flew to Hue in the middle

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.550
of this intense month-long
battle after having been told

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.620
by General Westmoreland
there was nothing going

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.470
on of any consequence in Hue.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:36.030
And he lands in the middle
of a battle on a scale

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:39.000
of what he'd seen in World
War II in European cities.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.760
So it was so striking
the difference

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.820
between the official narrative
and the unofficial one

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:47.480
that it fueled the
candidacy of Eugene McCarthy

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.910
who was challenging Johnson
for the Democratic nomination,

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:54.250
that brought Robert F.
Kennedy into the race.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:57.160
Johnson decided just weeks

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.930
after this battle ended
not to seek another term.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:05.890
And I think it really
moved the antiwar movement

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:09.360
in the United States from the
fringes to the mainstream.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:13.370
I mean I think that the antiwar
movement was rooted prior

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.240
to the Tet Offensive in young
Americans who didn't want

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:19.450
to be drafted and who
didn't want to go fight.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:22.650
So the movement was
on college campuses,

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:27.880
it was moral leaders right
like Martin Luther King Junior,

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.050
William Sloane Coffin who
were fairly predictable

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.230
antiwar voices.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.200
I think what happened
after Tet is

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:40.770
that whole movement became much
more widespread and continued

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:43.600
to grow over the next
four or five years.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.680
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: Now a
cynic or a realistic can look

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.710
at that discrepancy
between the official version

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.010
of what's happening
on the ground

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:53.620
and say well they were lying.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:57.170
But what do you think,
what's a fuller version

00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:59.810
of what accounts for
that discrepancy?

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:02.250
Was it just people not
wanting to see what was

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:03.640
in front of their eyes?

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.940
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Right.

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.240
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: Was it
a long-running narrative

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.110
that they had trouble
moving away from?

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:12.330
What accounts for
that stark difference?

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.070
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Well I can't
speak to the Vietnam War

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:17.340
as a whole, but I do know a
lot about the battle of Hue.

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.550
And I think it's fair to say

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.660
that the United States military
was shocked by the scale

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:27.300
and intensity of the Tet
Offensive, which frankly failed

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.640
in most places in south Vietnam.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.050
It failed ultimately
in Hue depending

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:34.860
on how you measure
success and failure.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:41.450
So I don't really fault General
Westmoreland and his staff

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:43.540
for being taken by surprise

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:47.640
because the enemy was very
skilled, very capable.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:54.130
And I think anyone in a war
situation the enemy can get one

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:55.430
over on you.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.080
Where I do fault them
and I fault Westmoreland

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.390
in particular is that
weeks after the city

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:05.790
of Hue had been taken by north
Vietnamese troops he continued

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.680
to deny reality.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.840
And this was reality
being reported to him,

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:12.360
and you can go look
it up in his papers

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.330
in the Lyndon Johnson
Library in Austin

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.490
where he's getting
intelligence reports

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.510
which are extremely accurate.

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:24.670
He's getting first-hand reports
from young American Marines

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:28.240
and army officers who were in
the field, who are radioing back

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:31.040
that they're facing
overwhelming enemy forces.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:36.140
Who were disbelieved and who
were repeatedly sent on missions

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:37.810
against overwhelming odds.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:41.090
So many, it isn't just
misleading the American people

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.190
the decisions that were
being made in the first weeks

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:47.380
of that battle killed a lot
of young Americans foolishly.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:50.760
Because I think that they could
have and should known better.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.140
And I don't really know the
ultimate reason for it other

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:59.160
than I think when you're in
command you can be a victim

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:00.460
of a kind of a syndrome

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:04.860
where you believe you understand
the battlefield better

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.160
than anyone else.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.700
And you like people
in many fields tend

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:12.760
to ignore information that
contradicts what you believe

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.410
to be true and stress
the information

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.320
that you think vindicates
your point of view.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:21.230
I think you know that's
true in all walks of life,

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.760
but in a battle the
consequences are tragic.

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:27.000
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: So
Westmoreland clearly emerges

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.230
as one of I won't say villain

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.500
but villainish [phonetic]
characters in the story?

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.280
And it reminded me a little bit

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:38.520
of H. R. McMaster's book,
Dereliction of Duty.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.820
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Right.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:41.750
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: Which he
wrote, the former national --

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.180
he should not be known simply

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.400
as the former financial security
advisor to President Trump.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.480
But he wrote a book some 20
years ago in which his focus was

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:54.210
on the joint chiefs
during Vietnam and the way

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.900
in which they either
weren't honest or forthcoming

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.800
with civilian leadership
or were manipulated

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:01.560
by the civilian leadership.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:06.310
You know when you put
the joint chiefs together

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:14.200
with Westmoreland what picture
does it paint of the brass,

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.780
the military leadership at
the time during this war?

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.030
And do you think that's sort

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:23.270
of a fair characterization
writ large?

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:27.480
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: I think Vietnam
was a great learning experience

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.780
for our military.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.840
I think that the United
States military was probably

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.470
at its high watermark
in terms of self-regard.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:39.080
After World War II, after the
Korean War the United States

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:44.670
military was easily the
most powerful, best trained,

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:47.970
best equipped military
probably in history.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:52.630
And I think that I read
a kind of arrogance

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:57.080
where you know the very idea
that a sort of ragtag bunch

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:01.010
of gorillas and a
poorly funded army

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:04.780
from Hanoi would somehow fight
the United States military

00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:07.560
with its helicopters
and rockets, and tons

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.550
and tons of bombs and B-52s.

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:12.820
There was no force in
the world that was felt

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.120
to be the match for it.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:18.400
But it turns out that in this
battlefield they were more

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.820
than holding their own.

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.260
And I think that
that came as a shock

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:25.960
to everyone except the
young military officers

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.260
who were facing it.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.900
And a lot of the hostile
reporting about the war

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.850
in Vietnam which came from
young reporters who were going

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:35.870
out into the field actually came

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:37.710
from the people they
were interviewing,

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.630
young Marine captains who
were the ones being given the

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:43.660
responsibility to
carry out the mission.

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:45.730
And who were telling
a different story

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:49.280
than the 5 o'clock
follies back in the Saigon.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:53.510
So I do think that many of
the people who I interviewed

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:58.300
in writing Hue were young
military officers at the time,

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:02.570
went on to long careers and
retired as brigadier generals,

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.190
four-star generals,
and you know are some

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.800
of the leaders of the military.

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.720
And I know they brought the
lessons that they learned

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.660
from Vietnam into our
military as a whole.

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:17.320
So I hope and I believe that
our military learned a lot

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.620
from that.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.110
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: Hoping you
can talk about those interviews.

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.550
You know you focus in this book,

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:27.250
I mean part of the great
strength of not just this book,

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:30.320
but your work in general is
you focus on the fighters,

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:35.110
focus on the sort of grunt
level heroism, and misdeeds

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:38.040
by men engaged in battle.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:44.220
Fifty years later these
men are in their 70's.

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:49.100
How willing were they to talk
to you about this, to look back,

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.750
to really open up
about what happened?

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:53.530
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Intensely
willing.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:56.720
You know often people ask me how
did you get this person to talk

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:58.380
to you and the answer is
generally I showed up.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.780
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: Showed up.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.860
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: I think in
fact, you know, as I look back,

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.040
particularly in the
early stages of reporting

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:10.900
where I literally knew
nothing I'm grateful

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:13.540
and wonderfully impressed
by the patience of men

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.430
like General Mike Downs, who
was in the middle of that fight,

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:18.180
a retired Marine Corps general

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.250
who very patiently you know
explained to me simple things

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:23.560
that you would think
anybody writing

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.440
about a battle ought
to know you know.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:28.060
One by one by one.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:33.090
So and that went down to
the individual privates,

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:37.180
the young sergeants who
were serving their four

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:41.610
or rather their one-year
tour over in Vietnam

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:44.840
and had these intense
and traumatic experiences

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.050
which have colored the
rest of their lives.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:52.800
So they were for the most part
very willing to talk and also,

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:58.440
I find spoke with tremendous
candor about how they felt,

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.540
why they did what they did,
when they were frightened,

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.000
when they you know accidentally
did something right.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.390
And about the people they
admired and the people

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.130
that they didn't admire.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:15.260
So it's a remarkable experience
when you begin listening

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.560
and listening and listening,

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.580
and pulling together
all these accounts

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.770
into a kind of a mosaic.

00:21:20.770 --> 00:21:24.590
I tell people that I view
a book like Hue as one

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:28.980
of those composite photographs
that are made up of thousands

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:32.340
of little individual photographs
that if you step back

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:35.080
from it looks like a portrait,

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.050
but when you look closely
it's actually thousands

00:21:37.050 --> 00:21:40.290
of individual little pictures.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:44.310
And that's what this book is,
it's a portrait of the battle

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:48.860
of Hue made up of literally
thousands of individual stories.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:50.160
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada:
Let's look at one

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.310
of those pictures for a moment.

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:55.780
There's a Marine battalion
commander Ernie Cheatham

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:59.160
in this book, a former
NFL player.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:00.460
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Right.

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:03.430
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: Who
emerges, I mean he's almost

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:07.500
like an anti-Westmoreland
in terms of what you see

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.440
about leadership with him.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.220
For those of you who haven't
had a chance to read it

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.030
yet can you tell us about Ernie?

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.330
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Ernie.

00:22:16.330 --> 00:22:17.630
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada:
And what you learned

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:18.930
about the war through his story?

00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:20.230
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Well Ernie

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:21.870
as you said was a battalion
commander and a couple

00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:25.510
of his companies had been thrown
in piecemeal into the battle

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:29.940
of Hue before commanders
really understood the scale

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.660
of the enemy presence
in the city.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.660
So Ernie who is a
gigantic man, he's actually

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:38.200
in the Pro Football Hall of Fame

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.890
as the highest-ranking
military officer who ever played

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:44.520
for the Steelers and
the Baltimore Colts.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:47.450
He said at one time that he
was traded from the Colts

00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:53.570
to the Steelers for a water
bucket and an unused helmet.

00:22:53.570 --> 00:22:58.530
But he was given the assignment
or demanded to be sent to Hue

00:22:58.530 --> 00:23:01.770
because so many of his
young troops were there.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.870
So unlike I think
Westmoreland and some

00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:08.390
of the higher command
whose error in judgment was

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:10.720
to believe they knew
more than the people

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:12.850
who were on the ground.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:16.640
Ernie spent the whole night
before going into way Hue trying

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.160
to figure out how to
lead this counterattack,

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.460
to take the city back.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:24.500
And he didn't know,
he started off

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.230
by realizing he didn't know
how many enemy were there,

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:29.510
he didn't know what kind
of weapons they had.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:31.330
He didn't know where
they were in the city.

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:32.630
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: This
is the night before?

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:33.930
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: The
night before.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.230
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: Okay.

00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:37.220
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: And he is
telling himself what do I know.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:40.130
I know that I'm going to
be fighting in a city,

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:43.160
and I know that my men have
never fought in a city before

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.880
and we don't have any idea
how to conduct tactics

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.540
in that kind of an environment.

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:53.120
So he literally sought out
old Marine Corps handbooks

00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:56.740
on assaulting fortified
positions in urban fighting

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:59.610
from the Korean War and
spent the whole night boning

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:02.670
up on tactics for
assaulting a building

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.520
where the enemy was located.

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:08.440
And realized that his men
had inadequate weapons

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.720
because in one instance you know

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.320
in World War II American
soldiers carried bazookas

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.000
which were big heavy metal tubes

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.720
which fired a heavy
30-pound rocket

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.120
which would blow a
hole in a stone wall.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.460
In Vietnam, they
had been upgraded

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:29.660
to these plastic tubes called
LAWs which were very much easier

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.740
to carry around, but
which didn't fire

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:34.290
as heavy a round
as the bazookas.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:37.810
So the night before he goes
into Hue he rounds up as many

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:40.940
of these old heavier
weapons as he can find

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.240
and also puts his hands on all

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.840
of the large recoilless
rifles he can find

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.870
because he knows they're
going to need to blow holes

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:53.920
in the walls of these very
big stone buildings in Hue.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:59.200
And also sought tear gas because
the way you assault a fortified

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.000
position is you poke holes
in it, you pump tear gas in

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.440
and hopefully the enemy clears

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.470
out before you send your
men across the street.

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:10.540
In the days before he got
there his men were being sent

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.400
across the street to
attack fortified positions

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.420
and just getting
chewed to pieces.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:17.550
So you can understand
Mike Downs was one

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:23.210
of his company commanders
how thrilled they were

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:25.330
when Ernie showed up
with all those weapons

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:27.090
and with a more intelligent
way of going

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:31.130
about what they were
trying to do.

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:32.740
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: That seems
insane that he, you know,

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.700
that the night before he'd be

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.010
like I realize I have
no idea how I'm going.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:38.310
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Right.

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:39.610
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada:
To do this and.

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:40.910
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: That
was not the kind

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:42.210
of war we were fighting
in Vietnam.

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:44.740
I mean it was primarily
being fought in the mountains

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:48.060
and in the rice patties, and
American troops would often go

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:52.120
on long patrols and never see
the enemy until they got hit.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.110
And they would be these
small hit-and-run attacks

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:57.030
so it was terribly
frustrating for American troops

00:25:57.030 --> 00:26:00.790
to be fighting an enemy
that they rarely even saw.

00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:03.610
And so suddenly they're
in a city

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:07.830
where there's 10,000 enemy
troops right in front of them,

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:09.700
and they don't have
the same numbers,

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.670
they don't have the
right kind of weapons.

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:14.720
And Ernie was smart
enough to realize that

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.070
and to take the appropriate
steps.

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:20.920
And I think he is what
enabled the Marine Corps

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:23.530
to turn the tables on
the Vietnamese there

00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:25.060
in the first weeks
of the battle.

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.440
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: And
that's leadership right,

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.190
that's him taking.

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:29.490
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Right.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:30.790
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada:
Charge of the situation

00:26:30.790 --> 00:26:32.090
by admitting what
he didn't know.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:33.390
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: And for
one thing he was there

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:34.800
and he put himself right
in the middle of the fight.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.390
And he was right alongside
his men, he trusted his men.

00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:41.540
And if they told him that
there were enemy troops up on

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:45.100
that rooftop he didn't tell them
no there couldn't possibly be

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.270
troops there he believed them.

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:51.640
Karl Marlantes wrote this
wonderful review of Hue

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:56.610
for the Wall Street Journal
and Karl is a Vietnam veteran,

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:58.710
was a young officer in Vietnam.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:01.810
And he told the story of a
friend of his in Vietnam who was

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:06.670
on a hilltop watching a caravan
of enemy trucks making its way

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:10.250
up the hill toward his
position, and he radioed back

00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:12.230
to tell his commander
what he was seeing

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.830
and his commander said that's
not possible they don't have

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:16.130
any trucks.

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:17.430
He said well sir.

00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:18.760
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: Are you
going to believe me or?

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.800
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: He said you
are where you are and I am

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:24.640
where I am but where I
am I see Goddamn trucks.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.450
So apparently it was not an
uncommon problem in Vietnam.

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:31.670
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: And
what is striking to me

00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:34.800
about this story is
to think even briefly

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.730
about Vietnam as an urban war.

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:38.030
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Yeah.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:43.000
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: Right, because
it's not the way we have been

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.230
programmed or taught to think
about the war in this way.

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:50.860
We think of Baghdad, we think
of other conflict you know.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:58.450
But that makes this battle
so unique and so distinct.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:05.990
You read a lot about Vietnam
leading up to writing this book.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.220
What for you are, you know,

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:11.320
did you decide really
are the greatest works

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:18.140
about this war Hue 1968,
notwithstanding for the moment?

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.440
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Yeah.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.450
I would say I think that David
Halberstam's book The Best

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:25.150
and The Brightest is
still a classic in terms

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:30.080
of understanding the people and
the thought processes that led

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.500
to our involvement in Vietnam.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.890
I think that Neil Sheehan's
book A Bright Shining Lie is one

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:40.720
of the great books
about Vietnam.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:45.170
I could if I had a chance
to think about this hard.

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:46.470
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: Sorry.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:47.770
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Thought
of a couple more.

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:51.680
I read any number of
really terrific memoirs

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:55.150
by individual American
officers and soldiers.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:59.010
There's one called The Lost
Battalion by Charles Krohn

00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:06.690
which tells the story of
his air cavalry battalion,

00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:09.170
which was basically on foot

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:12.090
because they didn't have
sufficient helicopters

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:16.380
in position who was ordered to
march his men a couple miles

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:20.260
down route 1 to the
walls of the city of Hue.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.980
And told you know this would
be like a four-hour mission

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.970
and he lost half
of his battalion.

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:32.570
And they got pinned down
in the in the fields.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:36.560
They had to cross enemy
lines in the darkness,

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.410
walking men holding on to the
man in front of them in order

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:45.470
to stay together as quietly as
possible to pull his men out.

00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:48.390
Otherwise, I think they would've
been completely wiped out.

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:51.660
That story is I think one
of the most remarkable.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:55.090
In my book the Battle of Hue
and I never would've been able

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:59.530
to tell it without Charles
Krohn's book The Lost Battalion.

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:01.040
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: Great,
that's a great tip.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.140
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: He's also
a really good writer.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:07.130
There's a fellow Nichols Warr,
who's been a critic frankly

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:08.670
of my book which is fine,

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:12.410
but I thought he wrote a really
good account of his experience

00:30:12.410 --> 00:30:16.880
as a young Marine officer in
what he called Phase Line Green,

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.660
that's another good one.

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:23.710
Well yeah, Dispatch is
Michael Herr's book.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:28.210
I was thinking more
of the military.

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:29.510
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: Right.

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:30.810
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Accounts,

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:32.500
but Michael Herr's classic
Dispatch will be read

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.050
for a long time by people
who will have no interest

00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:38.310
in Vietnam they'll read
it just for the writing.

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:40.320
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: Last question
I'll ask you before we turn it

00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.450
over to questions
from the audience.

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:46.190
People like me or critics are
always trying to find a thread

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:47.740
through the works of a writer

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.400
so then we can write
some big thoughtful piece

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:51.310
about how it all ties together.

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:54.910
You're here so I can just ask
you, you know when you look,

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.050
when you think about
your full body of work,

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:59.900
you know you focus a lot on
these on these moments right.

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.590
You know Black Hawk
Down is a moment.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:05.520
You know Guests of the
Ayatollah is a moment.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.990
Kuwait is a moment.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:11.370
You know when you put all this
together what story do you think

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:18.540
you are telling in sort of your
overall project as a writer?

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.960
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Well it's
not that I set out to do it,

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.730
but as I look back
I'm old enough I have

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:24.200
to look back over
a body of work.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.610
I think I've struggled
a lot with trying

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:29.230
to understand America's
role in the world.

00:31:29.230 --> 00:31:32.050
And I think you know we are
at a unique point in history

00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:35.000
where our country is
the most, is the richest

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.730
and most powerful
nation in the world.

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:40.520
We are capable of
projecting power anywhere

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.820
in the world we want to.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:46.410
And we've made some wonderful
uses of that opportunity

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:49.590
and we've made some
tragic uses of that.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:54.120
We've engendered in some cases
irrational hatreds you know

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.630
from people around the world.

00:31:55.630 --> 00:31:59.720
But I think that struggle
of figuring out how

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.270
to be an American
in the 20th century,

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:06.880
in the 21st century is something
that I find deeply fascinating.

00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:10.380
And that's why I'm always
so interested in traveling

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:11.810
to these parts of the world

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:15.230
where the United States has
projected military force

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:19.600
and trying to understand
those stories through the eyes

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:22.120
of the people who live there
and through their culture,

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:25.380
through their history, and how
they see the United States.

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:26.870
And I think you know,

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:31.120
I hope that that will help all
Americans have a more nuanced

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.510
understanding of what it means

00:32:33.510 --> 00:32:37.570
to be a good citizen
of the world.

00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:39.510
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada:
Thank you, yeah.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:49.070
[ Applause ]

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.350
We have time for questions so
you can line up at the mics

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:55.220
and please let's make
them questions rather

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.890
than comments or speeches.

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:58.190
Thank you.

00:32:58.190 --> 00:32:59.490
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:00.790
After going to Vietnam
and interviewing

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:05.220
so many Vietnamese what's the
story that America yet has heard

00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:08.300
about them during that time
or any thoughts around that?

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.670
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: I'm sorry
I had a hard time hearing.

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:10.970
&gt;&gt; Oh, I'm sorry.

00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:12.270
After going to Vietnam
and interviewing

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:16.520
so many Vietnamese what's
the story America still needs

00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:20.910
to hear about them
during that time?

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:22.460
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: That's
a good question.

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.430
You know I think and I said
a little of this earlier

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:33.610
that it's always enlightening to
see the humanity in the enemy.

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:36.830
And you know one
story typical of many,

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:38.840
many of these young Americans

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.350
who were fighting
were 18, 19 years old.

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:46.930
I met this young
woman who was fighting

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:52.380
for the Vietcong and she was 18.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.080
Her whole family had been
fighting against the French

00:33:56.080 --> 00:33:59.070
and then against the
Japanese, and then now

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.410
against the Americans.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:03.700
And I think Cha-Ti Mong
[assumed spelling] is her name.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:07.160
She had a very moving story,

00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:10.740
she was ultimately wounded
fighting for the city.

00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:17.890
So to me this was a thoroughly
decent young woman who went

00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:22.900
through tremendous sacrifices,
was badly wounded fighting

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:25.800
for what she believed
was the right thing.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:32.040
And even though I make a point
of writing how the excesses

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:35.970
of the forces that she was
fighting for some of them tragic

00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:41.000
and horrible don't necessarily
define the individuals

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.140
who were trying to
do the right thing.

00:34:44.140 --> 00:34:46.610
I think the bottom line is
that what we need to understand

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:50.350
about the Vietnamese people
in the 1960's was most

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:53.880
of them I think were
fighting for independence.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.990
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:57.290
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: Sir.

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.700
&gt;&gt; My question is about
the competence and effort

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:02.400
of the American soldier
in that battle.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.910
You know we're familiar with
stories of you know a lot

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:07.070
of soldiers wanted to get out
of Vietnam, they didn't want

00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:09.390
to be there, they didn't
trust their leaders.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:13.110
But when the battles actually
happened it seems like they gave

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:16.400
at their best, perhaps because
their lives were at stake.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.500
But what was your
perception of the quality

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:21.860
of the American soldier and
the lower-level officers

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:23.880
in this battle?

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:27.000
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: I can only
use the word extraordinary.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.830
These were young men who were
in a terrifying position.

00:35:30.830 --> 00:35:33.410
Outgunned at least
in the beginning

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:36.340
of the battle and outnumbered.

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:42.280
They to a man told me that
they figured they'd be killed

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.160
or badly wounded because many

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.000
of the people I interviewed
were wounded,

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.300
they're survivors obviously,

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.480
but they were evacuated
before the battle was over.

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:58.390
And I think their ability
to continue attacking,

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:00.720
to continue doing what
they were ordered to do

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.790
under such hellish
circumstances I don't know

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:07.360
that I would have the courage
or the wherewithal to do it.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.060
And they also were very smart.

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:13.400
They didn't know how to fight
in a city in the beginning

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.820
but they figured out tactics and
they figured on-the-fly a lot

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.380
of things that kept them alive,
and that kept them going.

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:23.460
And I think when you
dig into the details

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:26.200
of what I'm talking about,
like learning exactly

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.550
where to place a
round on a house

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.470
to collapse the entire
house they learned how

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:32.770
to do things like that.

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:35.770
How to assault windows you
know by shooting at the edges

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:38.410
of the windows instead of
shooting through the windows.

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:42.450
Very detailed little tricks
that they picked up very quickly

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:44.750
as you will when your life is

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:48.740
in the balance was nothing
short of extraordinary.

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:51.510
So I have tremendous
admiration for their skill

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:53.050
and for their courage.

00:36:53.050 --> 00:36:55.360
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.860
Having written about
and learned so much

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:02.480
about Vietnam I was wondering
if you had any comments

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:06.910
about Senator McCain, his
experiences there if you know

00:37:06.910 --> 00:37:10.290
about them and him having
been a prisoner of war,

00:37:10.290 --> 00:37:13.980
and also his views on torture?

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:17.710
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Yeah,
well you know I think most

00:37:17.710 --> 00:37:19.600
of us now know the
story of John McCain.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:24.550
It's hard to imagine
a more stirring

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:29.070
and heroic individual
caught up in that conflict.

00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:32.780
I think drawn for all
the best reasons to fight

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:36.640
for his country,
being used in a way

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:41.560
which was I think
misguided and foolish.

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.770
Just you know we were
sending aviators over Hanoi

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:46.570
to bomb things like
wooden bridges

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:48.450
that could be rebuilt in days.

00:37:48.450 --> 00:37:50.700
We were exposing
aviators like John McCain

00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:53.680
to tremendous hazards
for very little gain,

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:58.270
and he paid an extraordinarily
high price for his patriotism

00:37:58.270 --> 00:38:00.850
and valor and then
suffered horribly

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:03.910
at the hands of his captors.

00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:10.730
I think much to his credit
he emerged from that I think

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:16.330
with a moral conviction
against abusing prisoners

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:18.140
and against abusing inmates.

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:22.760
And he adhered to that through
years when many in his party,

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:27.520
many who were, you would have
expected him to be allied

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.870
to he stuck to his guns.

00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:34.680
And so I admired
him as an individual

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:38.640
and I don't think I've
read too many stories

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:43.080
of individual courage that match
John McCain's story in Vietnam.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:51.500
&gt;&gt; You mentioned the
invincibility of the US military

00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:54.720
at this time versus the
ragtag army Vietnam,

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.960
but you also mentioned that they
were fighting for independence.

00:38:57.960 --> 00:39:02.200
And if their cause was basically
just we were the bad guys even

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:05.590
though we had overwhelming
military force.

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:10.960
What role did all this play
in the fact that we lost

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:14.500
against a ragtag army?

00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.850
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Well I think
that you know if I had to point

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:23.770
to the basic flaw in America's
effort in Vietnam it was

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:27.240
that we did not have any
legitimate indigenous allies

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.630
of any consequence.

00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:30.220
We were fighting on behalf

00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:34.330
of a makeshift South
Vietnamese government

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:36.440
that wasn't particularly
Democratic,

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.600
that had very little
broad popular support.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.770
And so no matter how
many bombs we dropped

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:44.540
and no matter how
skilled our soldiers were

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:47.680
and brave they were
fighting a population.

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:51.410
Those who were not shooting at
them were sheltering the people

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:53.600
who were shooting at
them and feeding them.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:58.450
I think that you,
we underestimated

00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:02.470
as a country the commitment
of the Vietnamese people.

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:06.160
And I do think that
you know the principles

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.500
that the United States
was fighting

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.550
for were the right ones.

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:13.110
And I think Vietnam frankly
has paid a heavy price

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:16.860
over the last half-century for
the victory of communist forces.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:21.300
They are still today primarily
an authoritarian country,

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.770
people don't have
the kind of freedoms

00:40:22.770 --> 00:40:25.330
that we have in this country.

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:27.320
They've loosened up the economy

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:29.480
so that people could
now own property

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.080
and start their own businesses.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:35.080
So they've begun to enjoy a
higher level of prosperity,

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:39.560
but I think they lost a great
deal when they sacrificed

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:43.870
in the name of independence
their own liberty.

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:48.030
So I think that the United
States very frequently

00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:51.070
when we send troops
overseas we do

00:40:51.070 --> 00:40:55.350
so with an incomplete
understanding of the region,

00:40:55.350 --> 00:40:58.130
of the country where
we're sending our troops.

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:03.380
And I think that in many cases
dooms us to, if not to fail

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:09.410
to end up and mired for
years and years and years

00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:11.710
without being able
to make progress.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:15.900
&gt;&gt; And this is actually like
sort of a follow-up question

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.200
to that gentleman's question.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:18.500
And I haven't read your book

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.210
yet so I don't know
how much you focus

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:22.500
on the South Vietnamese army.

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:27.390
But in terms of you're saying we
didn't have indigenous allies,

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:32.480
what was your take on the pretty
obvious lack of effectiveness

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:38.870
of the South Vietnamese army and
why it proved to be ineffective?

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:45.380
And not just in 1968, but
very obviously in 1975?

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:47.060
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: I'm sorry I'm
having a hard time hearing

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.360
because of the acoustics
in here.

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.500
But my evaluation of?

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.300
&gt;&gt; Well the South
Vietnamese army.

00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:55.630
You were saying that we
didn't have indigenous allies.

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:56.930
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Right.

00:41:56.930 --> 00:41:58.470
&gt;&gt; But we were technically
allies of the South Vietnamese.

00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:59.770
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Sure, yeah.

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:01.730
&gt;&gt; What's your take on their
lack of effectiveness both

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:04.450
in 68, but also in 75?

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:06.780
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Yeah, I mean
an army is a huge thing.

00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:12.170
So I have no doubt and I
met some extremely capable

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:17.240
and valorous former
South Vietnamese officers

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.950
and soldiers who
fought very hard.

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:24.310
I think the facts are that
they were few and far between,

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:27.210
that there was tremendous
corruption in that army.

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:30.810
Officers were given command
because they knew somebody

00:42:30.810 --> 00:42:32.470
or they paid off somebody.

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:35.440
They had no appetite for
actually leading men,

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:38.780
for doing things like
Ernie Cheatham was doing.

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:44.320
And I think that the inadequacy
of those forces was exposed

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:51.940
over time so that by 1975 once
the United States withdrew there

00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:54.390
was no chance that the South
Vietnamese army was going

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:57.900
to withstand the North
Vietnamese and the Vietcong.

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:00.800
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada: I think
we have time unfortunately

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:02.720
for just one more
quick question.

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.020
&gt;&gt; I better make it a good one.

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.620
So the research in
Hue was really amazing

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.440
and I'm interested in
your writing process.

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:11.250
Like once you actually sit
down to write do you write

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:13.880
for a certain word count or
a certain amount of time,

00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:15.450
and what are some of
the obstacles you face

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:18.170
to actually get to
the finish line?

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:19.880
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: Well
that's a good question.

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:22.930
You know the one thing that I
know most is the writing process

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:24.350
so I feel comfortable.

00:43:24.350 --> 00:43:32.530
But I, you know, I always begin
reporting stories, like spending

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:37.070
like 99% of my time reading,
traveling, interviewing,

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:41.210
researching, and maybe 1% of
my time jotting down ideas

00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:46.350
to myself of in this case just
trying to develop an overview

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:48.550
of what happened
during this battle.

00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:55.140
At some point in that process it
segues to about 50% reporting,

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:57.190
50% writing where
I know enough now

00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:59.470
to begin constructing
a narrative,

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.560
but I'm still doing
a lot of reporting.

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:04.810
And at the very end of the
process I'm 99% reporting

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:08.140
but I'm still running around
trying to get one last interview

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:12.360
or one more detail about
this thing or the other.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:16.430
When I'm writing full-time
I write in the mornings,

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:18.230
early in the morning
until about noon.

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:21.700
And then probably the most
that I can sit and write is

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:23.360
like four hours at a time.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:27.170
And I think after that I'm
not really writing very well

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:31.650
which makes for a nice
lifestyle you know.

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:36.420
You write in the morning and
then you goof off all afternoon.

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:42.870
But when I'm engaged in a story
like this it's all consuming,

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:45.430
I literally dream
about it at night.

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:50.740
And if I encounter narrative
problems trying to figure

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:54.000
out how to segue from one
thing to the other or how

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.020
to organize material in a
particular part of the story,

00:44:57.020 --> 00:45:01.150
that seem you know impossible
to me I'll sleep on it and wake

00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:03.660
up in the morning and
the answer is there.

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.530
So I really have a belief that
your mind continues to work

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:10.300
on things even when
you're not conscious of it.

00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:14.050
So that's pretty much my process
and you know a book like this,

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:16.710
this book was five, six
years in the making.

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:20.720
So that reporting piece of it
was pretty much all consuming

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:24.090
for three years or more, and
then the last, the writing part

00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:26.410
of it was like to
two years or more

00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:29.080
of pretty much you know
getting up in the morning

00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.570
and writing every day.

00:45:30.570 --> 00:45:31.870
&gt;&gt; Great, thank.

00:45:31.870 --> 00:45:33.170
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: You're welcome.

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:34.470
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada:
Mark, thank you for.

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:36.270
&gt;&gt; Mark Bowden: You're welcome.

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:46.040
[ Applause ]

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.340
&gt;&gt; Carlos Lozada:
We're glad you got

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.640
through that writing process.
