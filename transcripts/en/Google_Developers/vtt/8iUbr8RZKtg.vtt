MARCO PAGLIA: Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.610
And welcome to this workshop.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.400
My name is Marco, and I'm
an Android designer.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.290
Or even better, my name is
Marco, and I'm proud to be an

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.659
Android designer.

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:24.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.820
MARCO PAGLIA: We have
a good crowd.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.750
I mean, let's face it,
Android design is

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.140
just becoming amazing.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.340
When I look at the applications
that we have in

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.130
our market, they are
just becoming

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.320
astounding day by day.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.870
I'm so happy about where
we're going.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.550
I really feel that the
introduction of the Android

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.970
style guide was a massive
step forward

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.220
in the right direction.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.540
Google cares about
design as well.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.790
I mean, today you could have
had all sessions just about

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.510
design, if you wanted to.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.120
Raise your hands.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.960
How many people have
been to design talk

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.210
during this Google I/O?

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.870
That's what I'm talking about.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.470
Design and Android are just a
fantastic synergy together.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.740
And with the right development,
we can build the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.020
most amazing platform ever.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.550
I'm not alone running
this workshop.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.020
I have a lot of design team
here with me to help out.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.636
And let them introduce
for themselves.

00:01:27.636 --> 00:01:28.171
RICHARD FULCHER: Hi.

00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:29.310
I'm Rich Fulcher.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.720
You may remember me from
45 minutes ago.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.150
I'm an interaction designer on
the Android Design team.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.780
JEREMY LYON: Hi.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:37.630
I'm Jeremy Lyon.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.560
I'm also an interaction
designer on the

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.810
Android Design team.

00:01:42.926 --> 00:01:43.740
RACHEL GARB: Hi.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.280
I'm Rachel Garb, also an
interaction designer on the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.530
Android team.

00:01:49.636 --> 00:01:52.580
JENS NAGLE: I'm Jens Nagle,
Interaction Designer, Android

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.370
Design team.

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.262
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:01:55.262 --> 00:01:57.154
AUDIENCE: Thanks, Rich.

00:01:57.154 --> 00:01:58.100
PETER INGHAM: Hello.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.880
I'm Peter Ingham, a visual
designer on the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.410
Android Design team.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.410
AUDIENCE: Woo.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.910
MARCO PAGLIA: Woo.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.160
GUENTHER BEYER: My name's
Guenther Beyer.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.218
I'm a designer at GigBeat.

00:02:08.218 --> 00:02:12.456
MICHAEL NOVAK: I'm Mike Novak,
the developer of GigBeat.

00:02:12.456 --> 00:02:14.000
ERIC BURKE: My name
is Eric Burke.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.670
I'm with Square.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.800
And I'm not a designer.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.228
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:17.228 --> 00:02:21.512
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:21.512 --> 00:02:24.580
MARCO PAGLIA: So why
are we here today?

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.180
Why are we running
this workshop?

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.680
As many of you, I just like
reading blogs and finding out

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.570
things about Android and all
the discussions that people

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.280
are having about the patterns
and the Android style guide

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.570
and everything.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.820
And there's a particular topic
that I was really caught by

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.500
and really dragged my attention
into, which is,

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.790
today, we see a lot of new
applications coming up.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.860
We have tons of applications
coming up every day.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.520
We have very popular
applications that are coming

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.690
to Android.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.890
And people discuss about whether
they are using the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.800
right patterns, whether they
should use the right pattern,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.260
if they are not using
the right pattern,

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.180
and things like that.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.520
There's a particular question
that comes up once in a while.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.290
And it really made me think
about it, which is, if every

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.440
application is using the style
guide, it doesn't mean we're

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.680
going to have all applications
look the same.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.970
Well, the answer is,
obviously, not.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.710
Quite the opposite, actually.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.640
I really believe that Android
is the ecosystem out there

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.820
that offers the maximum
flexibility to really make

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.400
your brand to shine and be
different from all the other

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.780
applications in the market.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.770
So there's something very
important that we need to

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.180
understand.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.500
Being consistent and adapting
the right pattern to your

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.680
application, it doesn't mean
that your application has to

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.120
be looking the same
like others.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.820
You have many, many
ways to make your

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.360
application to look special.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.210
I mean, who would like to have
an ecosystem just to be very

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:01.330
boring and looking the same?

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.750
Think about human beings.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.770
We're all different.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.700
If you look around, there's no
one that looks like you.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.070
We also dress up differently to

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.382
distinguish from one another.

00:04:12.382 --> 00:04:15.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:20.860
When we're outside Google I/O.
And I think this is the way

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.220
that I'd like our ecosystems to
be, to have very different

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:25.700
application.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.290
At the same time, human beings
have very consistent patterns,

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.120
even if you don't speak the
language of someone else.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.040
I'm sure people here come
from all over the world.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.440
I come from Italy.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.760
And we may not know
the same language.

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.240
But if I smile, or if I get
angry, or if I raise up my

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.220
voice, people do understand
what I mean.

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.410
And so we want our application
to have that standard,

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:53.350
consistent way of behaving to be
consistent across Android.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.110
So how do we do it?

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.030
Well, the style guide is a great
example of how you need

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.100
to make certain things
very consistent.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.400
Because when they're not
consistent, we just break the

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.190
user maintained model.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.360
Learning an ecosystem, learning
an operating system

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.040
is difficult.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.320
You start playing with it, you
start swiping around, you

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.190
start learning some gestures.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.080
And when not all the
applications use them

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.230
consistently, then you
just don't know how

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.440
to operate any more.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.500
So you want to know where
my settings are.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.070
You want to know that, if I see
different views next to

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.860
each other, I can swipe
through it.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.800
You want to know where the
action bar is with all the

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.250
main actions.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.810
But at the same time, you
want to make it special.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.630
And there are ways to do it.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.610
You can play with graphics.

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.400
You can play with gradients.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.870
It's not true that all
applications on

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.750
Android has to be flat.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.250
Like we like the style, so we
adopt it that way in the core

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:44.890
applications.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.590
But, by any means, if your brand
is soft and wants to

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.000
have gradients and little
treatment in the action bars

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.960
and across the UI,
that's welcome.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.140
We want an ecosystem to
be very different.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.110
The way your little elements
animate from one another, if I

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.020
tap on a list view, how does it
zoom into a full view, this

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:05.740
is all up to you.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.260
And I think the more,
the merrier.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.140
The more diversity we can find
in our ecosystem, the more

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.590
people are going to find little
special things to make

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.070
their application even
more interesting.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.400
And I love to see it
when it happens.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.600
So this is why we're here.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.570
We want to deliver this
simple message.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:28.660
Designing for Android allows you
to have applications that

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.610
feels unique, that
feels beautiful.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.660
And at the same time,
they're very

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:36.230
consistent and easy to use.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:39.360
So to do that, this time we
organize the workshop.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.400
In fact, this is not
really a talk.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.650
I don't even have slides.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.700
But we have people coming
up on stage later.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.770
We have five developers that are
going to be showing their

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.240
applications and going to be
talking to us about the

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.020
challenges that they face.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.200
And then we're going to have
open discussions around what

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.880
we suggest, what
they could do.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.060
No dogma, though, just thinking
about possibilities

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.470
and really have an interesting
and nice friendly talk about

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:11.740
the challenges that the
patterns offer.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.590
Before we get to that, though,
I'm really, really excited to

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.670
have two guest speakers
here on stage with us.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.250
They introduced themselves
before.

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.110
They are representative of two
of my favorite applications.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.210
We have Square and
we have GigBeat.

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.040
So we're going to hear
their story.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.570
Most recently, they have created
their applications

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.290
following, most recently,
Android style guide pattern.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.710
So we're going to hear what they
did and why they did it.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.520
And I think the result
is excellent.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.390
They really are applications
that feel so different from

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.750
one another, although they're
very consistent in

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.730
the way you use them.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:47.180
And I love that.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.590
So without further ado, let me
introduce our first guest

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:53.483
speaker, Eric Burke.

00:07:53.483 --> 00:07:59.762
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:59.762 --> 00:08:00.760
ERIC BURKE: OK.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.780
So like I said, I am
not a designer.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.570
I am a software engineer.

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:07.370
I've been with Square for about
2 and 1/2 years now.

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.450
And what a lot of you might
not know is, when I joined

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.450
Square, there were only two
of us creating the Android

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.000
application.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.590
It was Bob Lee and myself.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.960
And we made the first version of
the Square app on Android.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.660
And we're very proud of the fact
that, on the day that our

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.590
first iPhone app was released
publicly, we also released our

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:25.710
Android app--

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:26.380
same day.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.860
That was two years ago.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.860
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.640
ERIC BURKE: So I think more
companies should do the same.

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.689
We just released an upgrade
to Pay With Square a

00:08:35.689 --> 00:08:36.330
couple of weeks ago.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:38.720
Again, same day,
both platforms.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.919
Earlier this week, we released
an upgrade to our Square Card

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:42.620
Reader product.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.340
We just re-skinned it
to use the Ice Cream

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.690
Sandwich and Holo look.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.510
So we're very proud of the
work we're doing here.

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:52.170
So without further ado, let's
take a little history lesson

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.830
and look at where Pay With
Square originated.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.170
This was our Card Case
application.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.250
This is what our app used
to look like on Android.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.460
This was well before Android
design guidelines were out.

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:07.110
This is what we call a
skeuomorphic design.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:09.650
So skeuomorphic means you're
trying to make an application

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.900
look like a real world object.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.920
Now in this case, obviously,
it looks like this gorgeous

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.240
leather wallet.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.240
And it has cards in there.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.490
And it looks like
something real.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.630
It's pretty.

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:26.050
People really loved the look.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.410
But from a design perspective,
it has a lot

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:31.050
of interaction problems.

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:34.810
So first of all, let's look
at technically on Android.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.870
This is really hard
to pull off.

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.190
I worked a lot of hours trying
to get this thing to look

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.500
right on Android.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.340
And I think, technically,
it just slowed us down.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.010
Also, as more and more screen
sizes come out, stretching a

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:51.900
bitmap like this ends up
producing fuzzy graphics, and

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.950
that's not cool.

00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:57.400
From a usability perspective,
you can only hold, really,

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.000
four cards.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.480
The top card, that's your
merchant card, that actually

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.410
has a hologram in the corner.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.340
And I think Apple copied us.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.210
When they move their phone, they
have a little hologram on

00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:10.270
their little, shiny,
silver thing.

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:13.190
We did that in our app also.

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.900
But for the merchants, you
can only hold four cards.

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:18.790
So that's a problem
scalability-wise.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.960
Also, to actually make a payment
with this product, you

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.600
had to first drag a card
out of the pocket and

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.600
then press a button.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.610
So it's multiple taps
just to perform

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.470
the most basic operation.

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:30.930
To see nearby merchants,
you had to tap the

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:32.280
Explore Places button.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.630
Again, it's multiple taps to
get to anywhere in the app.

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:39.650
Well, the good thing
is, it's pretty.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.720
The problems are, it requires
multiple taps to do anything.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.290
It's technically very
challenging.

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.720
It slows us down.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.670
And as phones get bigger,
it looks more fuzzy.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.170
So we threw it all away.

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.810
We completely redid it.

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.780
And this is what Pay With
Square looks like today.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.740
These are actually some of
the secondary screens.

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.440
So on the left, you see
the Twitter view.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.530
And as you can see, it
has an action bar.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:03.360
It has a view pager.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.190
You can do the whole horizontal
swipe gesture.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:08.230
On the right, I'll get
more into the detail

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.480
on that in a minute.

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.990
It's definitely an
Android app now.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.240
No one is going to look at
this and say that's a

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:18.220
skeuomorphic design or
that's an iPhone app.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.080
It looks totally like Android.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.950
What I'm not showing here is,
when we first started

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.700
prototyping this, we went
with a dark theme.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.190
So it was a lot of
black on black.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:32.330
And it looked kind of dreary.

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.790
It looked, maybe, the app feel
like you're in a nightclub.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:38.160
So we ended up going
with a light theme.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.740
And I think it's totally
appropriate for a dark theme

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.260
in a music player app,
which you're

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.820
going to see in a minute.

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.370
But for a payments application,
the light theme

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:47.030
worked better.

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:49.160
We're also using dark
action bars.

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:51.810
In the original iteration of
this, the action bar color

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:53.390
would change, depending
on what merchant you

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:54.520
were looking at.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.780
Each merchant had a theme and
a graphic, so it became more

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.850
of a showcase for
the merchants.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.940
But I think we came to the
conclusion that it looked a

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.110
little gaudy to be changing
the color constantly.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.590
And again, that was really nasty
to implement, because

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:09.680
you can't change the theme of
an activity after you've

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.520
launched it, without
some heroic hacks.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.120
So we went back to a more
streamlined, basic approach

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.180
with the light theme and
the dark action bar.

00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.615
So I really like where
it landed.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:26.620
Let's walk through the product
and see what it actually does.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.730
So obviously, we all
want bacon, right?

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:29.710
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:30.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:31.020
ERIC BURKE: Yeah.

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.280
A round of applause for bacon.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.700
So this is all about
making payments.

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.750
So when you pull out the app
and launch it, this is your

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.930
home screen.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:40.630
This is the Directory view.

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.440
At the top, you see,
what we call, the

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.600
Curated Merchants view.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.590
These are some of our
featured merchants.

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:48.970
It's a gallery that slides
from left to right.

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:51.750
It's full-bleed image.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.040
It has the little overlay
in the middle.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:56.430
But it just is a gorgeous
representation of the best

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:57.370
merchants in the system.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.020
Below that, we have
a list view that

00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.760
shows nearby merchants.

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:04.920
And you can fit a lot more
information into this design.

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.450
You can fit in information
about specials.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.740
You can fit in functionality
to open a tab.

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.870
You can fit in the distance.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.090
So contrast this with the
original Card Case design

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.860
where it was this gorgeous piece
of leather with cards.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.890
But none of that was
ever actionable.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:24.700
You had to go through multiple
taps to actually do anything.

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:28.350
So a key part of this design is
to reduce friction and make

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:30.570
the payment experience
effortless.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:33.910
So by reducing the number of
taps, fitting more information

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:36.080
into the main screen, the whole
user interface becomes a

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:37.670
lot more usable.

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.610
So when you want your
bacon, you tap the

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.700
button to open a tab.

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:43.590
And then you walk up to
the Bacon Bacon truck.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:45.020
You place your order.

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.250
And then you say,
put it on Eric.

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.090
And they will see my photo
on their register,

00:13:51.090 --> 00:13:52.580
along with my name.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:54.110
And they can tap a button
to charge me.

00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:55.860
And then I can put my phone
away, and I'm done.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.570
And I have my delicious bacon.

00:13:57.570 --> 00:13:59.550
And I've made a payment.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:02.730
So internally at Square, we talk
a lot about the notion of

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.120
humanizing payments.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.580
We'd rather the payment
experience be about an

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:09.690
exchange between two people,
rather than an exchange

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.100
between you and the
technology.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.020
So we really want to reduce the
number of taps and make

00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:17.160
the app as effortless
as possible.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.260
So we can take this
one step farther.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.120
We can actually enable a feature
called Auto Tab.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.230
So this app is deceptively--

00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:26.960
it looks like a really
simple app.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.080
There are only a few screens in
the app, but it's actually,

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.510
technically, really difficult
to code something like this.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.420
So with Auto Tabs, you can
put your phone away.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.300
And then, as you're walking
around, when you get within a

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:39.810
certain radius of your favorite
merchant, it'll

00:14:39.810 --> 00:14:41.330
automatically open a tab.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:46.800
So if I like coffee, I can set
up an auto tab for Sightglass

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:48.780
Coffee, which is just a few
blocks away from here.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.620
I highly recommend it.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.620
Also San Francisco Baking
Company is another great

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.050
merchant that's a
few blocks away.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:58.000
So I think these small
businesses would be thrilled

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.330
if 700 or 800 people installed
the app and just did a cash

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.930
mob and walked in and ordered
these amazing cookies or this

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:06.840
amazing coffee.

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:08.120
So that's my product plug.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.330
But with Auto Tabs,
it's the ultimate.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:12.470
You never have to touch
your phone.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:15.010
So the technology
just disappears.

00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:18.430
So we put a lot of emphasis on
pixel pushing, and making

00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:19.950
everything the right
colors, and getting

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:21.430
the alignment perfect.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.990
But in reality, our goal is to
make the interface vanish

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.000
completely.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.100
And that's the goal of Pay With
Square, is just to make

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.900
it go away.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.470
So we did bring cards
back in the latest

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:33.700
iteration of the app.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.690
So the first screen shot,
I showed you a

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:37.240
skeuomorphic design.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.760
We got rid of the cards.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.290
And what we found was that the
user interface was a little

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:41.850
bit boring.

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:44.330
And it was just a bunch of
images with list views.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.260
So we brought back, in
the latest iteration,

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.690
the notion of cards.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:49.840
And I really love the
way these look.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.730
They're not shaped like
a credit card.

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:54.590
They're actually shaped like a
square with rounded corners.

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.740
We do that a lot in our web
site and our applications,

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.750
because our company's called
Square and that's what our

00:15:58.750 --> 00:15:59.570
logo looks like.

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:03.240
And I made a little square
robot here for my shirt.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:07.670
So cards are great because it's
something tangible that

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:09.410
humans can relate to.

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.080
It's something that
you can touch.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.420
You can share cards.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:16.820
You'll see the same card on the
web site, in your Android

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.760
phone, on the iPhone.

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.680
You can email cards.

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.240
This is a showcase for the
merchants, so the merchant's

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:24.840
photos show up on here.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.250
The merchants can put
menus on here.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:29.160
Eventually, we're going to
have more information,

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.330
directions to the merchant.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.670
You can have punch cards,
specials, discounts,

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:34.740
first-visit rewards.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.280
All that stuff shows
up on the card.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:41.920
So a card is a concrete,
tangible thing in your UI that

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:44.390
users can explore and
play around with.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:47.770
And it's a delightful way to
do the user interface.

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:50.320
But even with the cards,
it's not designed to be

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.050
skeuomorphic.

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:54.490
It's not designed to stray
too far from an

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:56.080
Android-inspired feel.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:00.200
So I really like what
we did here.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.700
For images, getting a
little geeky here.

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.599
The server provides
the images to us.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:07.220
Since there's so many different
screen sizes, we

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:09.280
actually have a library.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.109
It's internal.

00:17:10.109 --> 00:17:11.599
I can't really share it
with you right now.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:14.640
But we actually ask our server,
give me the image at

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.730
this exact pixel width
and height.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.630
And then we also ask the server
to do layering and

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:20.290
compositing.

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:22.839
So the server can add the little
square and the borders

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.790
and rounded corners
and all that.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:27.579
And then, that way, it returns
the exact right image for the

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:28.830
Android device.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:30.770
In the list view there, you
see, again, we're using

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:34.110
squares with rounded corners.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:35.970
I know the Android look is more

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:37.180
towards full-bleed images.

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:40.370
And we did try that in some
early iterations.

00:17:40.370 --> 00:17:43.060
We just never could get it to
look quite right for our

00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:45.470
taste, so we went with
the rounded corners.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.710
I think that's OK.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.420
No one's really screamed at us
for not doing full-bleed

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:51.360
images in lists.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.480
I think you have some
latitude there.

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:58.540
Launcher shortcuts, we do this
in our Android client.

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.470
We don't do this, obviously,
in our iPhone

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.520
client, because you can't.

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.380
This is really cool, though.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:04.730
You can just tap
the icon in the

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.180
upper-right interaction bar.

00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:08.880
And you can add a shortcut to
your favorite merchant.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:10.370
It puts it on your desktop.

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:12.400
So there I have a Bacon
Bacon link.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.840
So now, whenever I'm near the
truck, I can just tap that

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.810
icon and open a tab at the
Bacon Bacon truck.

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:21.910
We take advantage of Android
Notifications pretty heavily.

00:18:21.910 --> 00:18:25.030
So whenever you have a tab open,
a notification is open.

00:18:25.030 --> 00:18:27.500
So you can take a phone call
while you're waiting in line,

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.480
or browse the web, whatever.

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.240
You can always come
back to your tab.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.270
And something I'm not showing
here is, once your tab is

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.350
closed, you can leave a tip.

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:38.640
So you can order your coffee,
drink it, walk away.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.890
And then, 10 minutes later, you
can pull out your phone

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:42.266
and say, oh, that was really
great coffee, I

00:18:42.266 --> 00:18:42.870
want to leave a tip.

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:45.140
And you can do it right
there from your phone.

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:48.310
Merchants love to get tips.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:51.320
So when I saw the keynote the
first day, the very first

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.540
thing I saw, when I saw the
notification enhancements, is

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:55.830
we should put tipping
in there.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.760
So I'm really excited about
Jelly Bean and being able to

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.050
take advantage of that even
further than what we do now.

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:05.680
So for sharing, you
can share cards.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.880
We use Android's normal
sharing mechanism.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:11.520
We don't try to embed a Twitter
log-in into our app

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.840
and a Facebook log-in and
all those stupid things

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.090
that other apps do.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:18.825
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:18.825 --> 00:19:20.075
ERIC BURKE: Yeah.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.850
This actually ends up being more
powerful, because you can

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.200
share with things you
never even imagined.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.150
Because I have the Bar
Code Scanner app

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:30.960
installed on my phone--

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.750
I was actually giving
a demo of the app to

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.720
my boss, Jack Dorsey.

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.090
And he looked at it.

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:39.140
And when I shared something,
he said, what is that?

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.960
Why does it say bar code?

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.510
I was like, I have no idea.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:43.950
I've never seen that.

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:44.740
Let's try it out.

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:47.600
So I tapped the button, and it
generates this bar code.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.560
And then he pulls out his
phone, and he scans it.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.290
And sure enough, I just shared
a card with a bar code.

00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:54.410
And we never wrote a single
line of code to do that.

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:55.660
So that was pretty amazing.

00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:59.740
And then, just to wrap it up,
if you go to your account

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:04.060
settings, this looks more like
a stock Holo look and feel.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.230
This is a visual cue that
you're kind of in the

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:09.320
underbelly of the app messing
with your account settings.

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.360
So our philosophy at Square
is we want our app to look

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.950
exactly the same on every
single Android phone.

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:19.200
So we back-ported as
much as possible.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.440
We actually hired Jake
Wharton, who wrote

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.000
ActionBarSherlock.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.690
And it's a great library.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:25.177
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:25.177 --> 00:20:26.151
ERIC BURKE: Yes.

00:20:26.151 --> 00:20:29.200
Thank you, Jake.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.490
And we're actually committed
to keeping that open source

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:33.040
and continuing to innovate
on that.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.150
And we've got some
more open source

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:35.880
libraries coming up soon.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:38.370
We use a compatibility library,
fragments, loaders,

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:38.940
all that stuff.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.560
So no matter what Android phone
you're on, it's going to

00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:44.340
look exactly the same and
provide a consistent user

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.230
experience.

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:46.610
So that is Pay With Square.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:48.036
Thank you.

00:20:48.036 --> 00:20:55.764
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:55.764 --> 00:20:59.040
MARCO PAGLIA: Let's have a
little chat here about what we

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.390
saw, what we like.

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:01.380
Probably everything.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.800
I think the application we just
saw is just so awesome.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:09.140
And the message that
I take out of it is

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:10.970
rounded squares are fine.

00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.540
There's nothing bad
about them.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.860
It's really about your
applications.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.410
It's how you feel about it.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:22.220
And you saw this application
is pretty special.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:22.980
It has cards.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.160
It has a lot of different
metaphors that you haven't

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:30.520
seen much before Jelly Bean on
Android, but still feels very,

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:32.640
very consistent with
our ecosystem.

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.640
There's one thing that I
particularly loved about it,

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.130
which is the use of
the big pictures.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.370
This is something that I can
never enforce enough.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.580
Pictures can never be too big.

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:45.780
It's a sort of mantra of mine.

00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:48.550
And if you have them,
just use them.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.780
And thinking about an
application that is so human,

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.710
so human that you don't even
have to look at it when you

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:57.330
pay, just providing the simple
thing, the simple, attractive,

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:00.020
big picture of the bar, is just
something that really,

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.290
really makes your application
shine.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.440
Is there any question for
Eric from the audience?

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.550
We have microphones there.

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:13.420
So when you feel like you want
to participate and say

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:14.840
something, feel free
to run up.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.380
And we'll try to
get questions.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.610
We want this to be more
of open discussions.

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:21.060
We're not going to have
Q&amp;A at the end.

00:22:25.362 --> 00:22:27.290
ERIC BURKE: My presentation
was perfect.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:28.751
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:28.751 --> 00:22:33.134
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:33.134 --> 00:22:34.108
MARCO PAGLIA: All right.

00:22:34.108 --> 00:22:37.010
ERIC BURKE: I think it'd be
great to have some questions.

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:39.280
So while you're walking up here,
I'll share an anecdote.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.810
When we first went away from the
wallet metaphor and went

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:44.510
to the new design, we actually
had a whole bunch of

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:47.330
complaints on Google Play.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.920
People were furious at us for
taking away the wallet.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.280
They thought we made it look
uglier and more boring.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:57.752
So anyway, I think those
people are all wrong.

00:22:57.752 --> 00:22:59.168
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:59.168 --> 00:23:02.030
ERIC BURKE: I think it does go
to show that you can't always

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:03.530
listen to everybody
who complains.

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:05.320
No matter what you do, when
you change your design,

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:06.410
someone's going to complain.

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:09.730
So anyway, yeah, question.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.960
AUDIENCE: Nice design.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:17.020
Did you take in account, by
doing the cards, any form of

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:21.320
sharing of payments
into account?

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:22.590
ERIC BURKE: Sharing--

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.510
so right now, when you
share, you just share

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:26.870
a link to the merchant.

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:29.760
So we're not doing sharing, like
peer-to-peer payments or

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.130
anything like that.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:33.550
Right now, it's strictly
sharing the card.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:34.770
Like I went to Sightglass.

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:37.280
I love their coffee, so I'm
going to Tweet about it.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.990
So there's an icon
to share it.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.020
Yeah, in the lower-right, I
can tap that and then it

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:45.330
brings up the Share Action
Provider menu.

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:46.988
So yeah.

00:23:46.988 --> 00:23:48.690
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:49.520
MARCO PAGLIA: Yeah.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.650
And particularly this screen,
I think, is very interesting

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:54.870
how the Square guys, they
have embedded all

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.440
actions in this card.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.295
It just feels so natural to have
actions embedded directly

00:24:01.295 --> 00:24:04.780
in the view, rather than in
the action bar right here.

00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:06.480
Having an action bar, obviously,
doesn't mean that

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.930
all the actions have
to be there.

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:08.720
It really depends on the view.

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.600
ERIC BURKE: We struggled a
lot with that, actually.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.670
Early iterations put more
in the action bar.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:15.705
But then it would go
into overflow.

00:24:15.705 --> 00:24:19.300
And we just found that people
didn't discover things, if

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.680
they're not right there,
visible on the screen.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:24.236
So that's been something we've
iterated on a lot.

00:24:24.236 --> 00:24:25.980
Yeah.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:26.245
Question?

00:24:26.245 --> 00:24:27.890
AUDIENCE: Hey, how's it going?

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:30.830
So I'm curious if you ended up
factoring in some customer

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:36.310
usability studies, or any work
like that, into your UI design

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:39.772
as you were evolving it.

00:24:39.772 --> 00:24:40.830
ERIC BURKE: No.

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:44.029
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:45.790
ERIC BURKE: I wish we would
do more of that.

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:48.590
One thing we do, we do have
a customer insights group.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:52.050
And their whole job is to
meet with merchants.

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:55.170
And they do a lot of
observations of the payment

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:55.740
experience.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.120
And they talk to people.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:01.370
But we're not really doing
formal usability studies yet.

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:03.980
And I'm hoping I can help
make that happen.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.680
I think it's something
we should do more of.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.870
But right now, no.

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:07.511
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:25:07.511 --> 00:25:07.640
Cool.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.020
Thanks.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:08.356
ERIC BURKE: Yep.

00:25:08.356 --> 00:25:09.760
MARCO PAGLIA: We'll take
two more questions,

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.365
and then we go ahead.

00:25:11.365 --> 00:25:13.640
AUDIENCE: Maybe a little
bit technical question.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.970
I want to ask when do you
fetch for images?

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:18.990
Are there any kind of
pre-fetching on the

00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:20.486
backgrounds maybe?

00:25:20.486 --> 00:25:23.650
ERIC BURKE: So the question is,
when do we fetch images?

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:28.200
So that's a tough engineering
problem that we're putting a

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.310
lot of emphasis on for the next
release, probably, is to

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:34.290
do a lot more caching.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:36.870
We don't do a tremendous amount
of pre-fetching, but we

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:38.820
do cache images on
the file system.

00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:41.780
So hopefully, when you come
back, you see the same images.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.420
And we're investing a lot of
resources to make that even

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.410
better in future versions.

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:48.740
That's actually been
a very tough

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.990
problem to solve, though.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.350
AUDIENCE: View one looked
very similar on

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:57.070
the iPhone and Android.

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:59.200
And then you switched to having
different looks and

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.780
feels on both platforms.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.825
Was that a tough brand
decision to make?

00:26:03.825 --> 00:26:05.830
ERIC BURKE: Yeah.

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:09.030
The philosophy at Square in the
early days was that both

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:10.990
apps had to look identical.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.450
And I was never thrilled
with that.

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:15.710
But we really have two primary
mobile applications.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.830
We have the payer application
and the seller application.

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:22.850
So in the seller application,
I am accepting a

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:23.570
payment from you.

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:26.000
But at some point, I hand
my phone over to you.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.840
And then you sign your signature
on the screen.

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.040
So in the seller app, it's
actually more important to

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.850
have consistency across
platforms.

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:35.640
Because if I'm buying something
and I walk up to you

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.500
and I'm signing my name and
giving you my credit card, I

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.770
want that application
to be trustworthy.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:43.450
So I need it to look
consistent.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:46.000
From the payer experience,
though, this is my phone and I

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:46.990
never give it to anybody else.

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:49.290
And I'm in Android
all day long.

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:51.820
So in the payer experience, we
have flexibility to be more

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:55.230
creative on the different
platforms and we can diverge a

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:55.960
little bit.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:56.420
It was funny.

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.830
One of the engineers made the
comment when we were first

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:02.740
going through this, he was
like, you know, what's

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.630
actually happening is our iPhone
client is becoming more

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:07.300
like an Android application.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.000
Because they went with a lot of
the full-bleed images also,

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.710
and it made the iPhone client
look more like Android.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.930
But yeah, because of the
audience, we feel like we can

00:27:16.930 --> 00:27:19.810
make each app look a little
bit more different on the

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:21.452
different platforms.

00:27:21.452 --> 00:27:21.844
Yep.

00:27:21.844 --> 00:27:22.630
MARCO PAGLIA: OK.

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:24.290
And on this great
question, let's

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:25.000
give a round of applause.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
ERIC BURKE: Thank you.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:31.740
MARCO PAGLIA: All right.

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.450
Let me introduce you to the
next guest speakers.

00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:41.490
They are the creators of
GigBeat, Michael Novak and

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:43.610
Guenther Beyer.

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:47.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:48.890
GUENTHER BEYER: Hello.

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:51.312
MICHAEL NOVAK: Do you
have the slides?

00:27:51.312 --> 00:27:52.562
MARCO PAGLIA: Sorry.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.540
MICHAEL NOVAK: We rock
Google Docs.

00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:11.950
So as Marco said, we're GigBeat,
which is a concert

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:13.200
application for Android.

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.330
It helps you find when your
favorite artists are going to

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:16.580
be in your city.

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:20.260
You'll actually need to be--

00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:21.230
GUENTHER BEYER: Go ahead?

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:22.674
MICHAEL NOVAK: No,
it's all you.

00:28:22.674 --> 00:28:23.880
Yes.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.140
So it lets you find out.

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:29.460
So it's great to go to shows,
but I found myself missing

00:28:29.460 --> 00:28:32.470
shows all the time, just not
finding out about it until

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:34.590
somebody says, you missed an
amazing show last night.

00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:35.550
I don't know why you
weren't there.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.280
It's like, thanks,
for inviting me.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.150
So I decided to solve that
problem by creating the

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:44.150
application that would let me
follow my artists and know

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:47.500
when they're going to actually
be in my city well before even

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.580
tickets usually sometimes
go on sale.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:54.720
And it lets us really get
excited about shows.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:57.794
So yeah, that's GigBeat.

00:28:57.794 --> 00:29:00.000
GUENTHER BEYER: We want to show
a couple of patterns that

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.550
we introduced to GigBeat,
because it has about six

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:04.300
months of evolution behind it.

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.570
And I think the first one
might be branding.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:09.390
Branding is always tough,
because on one side, you have

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:11.360
to create something
that stands out.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.340
On the other hand, you have to
create something that feels

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.610
just right in the ecosystem.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:18.040
So these two things are fighting
against each other a

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.100
little bit.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:23.320
And we tried a lot of things,
from Captain America to

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.250
audio-like icons, every
kind of shape.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:30.780
But finally, we just settled on
the initials GB, because we

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:31.730
really like the name.

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:34.930
And we felt that this
just is enough.

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:38.180
At the top one, we can see the
first icon that we ever

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:41.730
created that had some kind
of a final touch to it.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:43.990
And then you see how the
icon evolved over time.

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:47.690
And right now, it's pretty much
100% like an Ice Cream

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:50.120
Sandwich, Jelly Bean icon.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.840
So it's a similar thing
with color.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.660
Android is about simplicity,
or beauty and

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.690
simplicity, more or less.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:02.040
And you don't want to have a
lot of colors fighting for

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.960
attention, fighting against
each other.

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.860
So we just went with basic black
tones, gray tones and

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.890
obviously, a couple of white
tones for the phones.

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.710
And we are highlighting really
special parts about the

00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:15.200
application with this pink,
which is obviously our

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.680
branding color.

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.465
For example, in that list, you
can see a couple of gigs that

00:30:19.465 --> 00:30:21.570
are, more or less, interesting
for you from the

00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:22.600
bands that you love.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.400
And they also had one particular
pink line.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.990
That is a gig that is showing
up really close to where you

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.550
are right now.

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:31.560
So you probably have more of an
interest than all the other

00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:34.270
gigs to you.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:37.020
So I wanted to talk a little
bit about topography, but I

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.380
think Mike has a better
shirt for that part.

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:39.825
MICHAEL NOVAK: Yeah.

00:30:39.825 --> 00:30:41.816
I kind of like topography.

00:30:41.816 --> 00:30:45.310
So yeah, with GigBeat, in our
early versions, we were really

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.890
all over the place.

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:48.110
We had lots of different kind
of designs, different

00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:50.040
elements, different buttons.

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.270
And it was kind of
wacky, I think.

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:55.340
And we started with the
Eurofurence font up front.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.150
We used this, really,
mostly in headers.

00:30:57.150 --> 00:30:59.020
So you can see the top artist
is the only artist that

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.710
actually has that font.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:02.020
And we didn't want
to overuse it.

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.520
But we also wanted to get a
little bit of depth into the

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.210
application, so we thought
that might work.

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:09.340
But then we realized we were
having some spacing issues.

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.440
We realized that letters were
sometimes showing up on top of

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:11.850
each other.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:14.630
Rendering wasn't working,
really, that great for us, so

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:16.180
we decided to try
another font.

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.650
And also the same thing, really,
just a really annoying

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:21.310
problem of rendering.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:23.190
It really messed with our user
experience, we thought,

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:25.630
because it's important to
see that information.

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:28.220
And if that information is
obscured in any way, it's no

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:29.470
longer relevant for you.

00:31:32.470 --> 00:31:35.950
Before Roboto was available,
we decided to use the Droid

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:39.070
Sans as much as possible and,
really, just play around with

00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:40.650
the different weights
that were available

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:42.300
to give some depth.

00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:44.110
And then, when Roboto
came out, we were so

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.290
excited about it.

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:47.060
I'm actually wearing
a Roboto shirt.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:48.730
We were really excited
about it.

00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:51.230
And we decided to just
switch to using

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:53.480
it as much as possible.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:57.420
You can see we use some
different weights.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:59.430
The headline font for the list
item is actually a little bit

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:01.390
larger than some of
the other ones.

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:03.190
You'll see on some other slides
we've got some other

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:04.690
really creative ways
we use it.

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:08.437
A dashboard.

00:32:08.437 --> 00:32:10.720
Dashboard's a really interesting
pattern.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.685
You've seen it used throughout
Android for a

00:32:13.685 --> 00:32:14.670
little while now.

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:20.950
And we tried to figure out how
to use it and be unique.

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:24.510
We wanted to really emphasize
our brand as much as possible.

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:29.950
And the pink is really the
center of it, which is--

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:32.100
I'm color blind, so
that actually does

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.600
look pink to me, though.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.280
And the icons are
really unique.

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:39.900
We made sure that we spent lots
of time going over each

00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:42.390
individual icon to make sure
they really represented each

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:44.760
section in the best
way possible.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.680
We don't want to drive you to
an artist list when you care

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:51.290
more about locations, or when
you care about artists, seeing

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:53.690
what's all around you right
when you open up the

00:32:53.690 --> 00:32:54.560
application.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.870
So we felt, with the amount of
content that we had for the

00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:58.120
application, the dashboard
would work

00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:59.790
really, really well.

00:32:59.790 --> 00:33:01.040
And it also is unique.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:04.010
We actually, for Mobile World
Congress, had pins made up of

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.710
all our dashboard icons, which
was really neat because you

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:08.900
can actually associate the brand
with the part of the app

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:12.530
that, for the most, you'd see
as just pretty basic.

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:15.090
But then, going to the tablet,
we realized, well, you can't

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:18.180
just put four big buttons
onto a 10-inch screen.

00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:19.520
That doesn't really work.

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.360
So we decided to add as
much fresh content

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.530
as we possibly could.

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:27.150
And that's where we decided to
use the larger images to

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:29.810
really bring some color to it,
but also bring some relevant

00:33:29.810 --> 00:33:31.116
information.

00:33:31.116 --> 00:33:33.190
GUENTHER BEYER: Do we want to
add that the tablet version

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:34.475
isn't working perfectly yet?

00:33:34.475 --> 00:33:36.580
MICHAEL NOVAK: It's
kind of work--

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.665
yeah, it's awesome.

00:33:38.665 --> 00:33:40.085
GUENTHER BEYER: It's OK.

00:33:40.085 --> 00:33:42.560
MICHAEL NOVAK: It
looks pretty.

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:42.980
So yeah.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.920
I mean, we didn't actually get
to the dashboard in the

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:45.940
initial version.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:47.990
The version you see on the left
is a really old version

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:50.540
of the application that has
three tabs with a little

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:52.030
pointer at the bottom.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.270
We were kind of all
over the place.

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:54.440
There's some textures
in there.

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.000
And you have to do a lot
of clicking too.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.970
There's some buttons there that
just don't really feel

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.840
like they're part of the UI.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.650
Especially, what happens when
that list scrolls up?

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:04.290
All those buttons go away.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:05.870
So we really wanted
to simplify it.

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:07.060
And so that's how we
ended up coming

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.139
to our current dashboard.

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:10.710
We're like, let's really focus
on what are the most important

00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:13.630
pieces of our application and
give users the option to dive

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:15.909
into each one of those
as they wish.

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:21.480
ViewPager, it's awesome.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:24.610
So ViewPager works really well
for us on the phone.

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:27.700
When you click on the Artists
icon from the dashboard, you

00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:29.460
get presented with
the list view.

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.460
You get to see all your artists
up front, which is

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.969
every artist that you follow
inside the application.

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:36.040
You swipe to the right,
you can see Last.fm

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:38.590
recommendations, if you're
a Last.fm user.

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:40.199
And when you swipe to the
left, you actually

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:41.520
see what's near you.

00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:43.770
So it basically just cuts out
all of the artists that are

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:45.980
not going to be in your city.

00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:48.600
And you basically could see your
entire artist collection,

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.409
just by swiping up and down,
left and right, throughout the

00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:51.949
entire list.

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:53.800
It feels really great.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.440
And when we went to the tablet,
it didn't exactly work

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.150
the same way, because then you
didn't want just really big

00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:59.610
lists all over the place.

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:02.760
So we decided to use bigger
images again and do a grid

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.670
view with--

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:06.620
what you can't really see on the
phone is a filtered list.

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:08.720
So you could actually
filter through.

00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.360
We actually list out the
services, so you could just

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.150
see what you have from RDO, what
you have from Last.fm.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:17.920
It gives you some
options there.

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.780
Location, location
was really fun.

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:22.480
That took us a while, too.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.740
This is also something we just
didn't get right, which--

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:28.090
it's actually OK to not get
things right the first time.

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:30.090
You really learn a lot from
the whole process.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:33.520
So it was definitely a learning
process for us.

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:35.230
We have some buttons.

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:37.730
Like you can click a button to
get information that's near

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:41.120
you, which, for us, felt really
awkward, because we can

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:43.710
actually get access to the
GPS and just start

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:44.680
loading data for you.

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.430
So why should we have to wait
for you to click the button?

00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:48.920
And then also the same
thing for a search.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.510
It was just tucked
right next to it.

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:51.760
And you had to search
for a city.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.910
And this list view would
actually be empty, if you

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:56.130
didn't have any content already
searched for in the

00:35:56.130 --> 00:36:00.340
application, which is
also very useful.

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.150
So we tried to do some
improvements here.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:05.695
We added a Search bar, for some
reason, in the screen at

00:36:05.695 --> 00:36:06.730
the top of the list.

00:36:06.730 --> 00:36:08.640
And then we just decided it
would be really awesome if you

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.690
could favorite some of
these locations.

00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:13.510
If you're not somebody that
travels very often, you're

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:16.130
going to go back to the same
location over and over again.

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:17.830
So we figured it would be great
to have those right on

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:20.485
the first screen of the Location
section to really get

00:36:20.485 --> 00:36:21.960
some easy access.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:24.750
But it's really empty, if you
don't have any favorites.

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.590
You still have to do something
to get content.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:30.860
So what we decided to do, after
lots of debate, was how

00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.710
do we get nearby information
and favorite information

00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:36.280
together on a screen so that
they could provide as much

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.720
useful information without
much interaction?

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.770
So we decided, let's pin
the favorites up to

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:41.700
the top of the screen.

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:44.676
And you'll always have
easy access to those.

00:36:44.676 --> 00:36:46.160
Those are definitely very
important to you.

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.950
But if you've never used the
app before or maybe you

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:50.600
haven't favorited anything yet,
you can still get nearby

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.650
information as well.

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:52.480
Or you could be traveling.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:53.560
Like we're in San Francisco.

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.830
So most of my favorites
are in New York.

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:58.000
But if I open up the Location
screen, I can start to see

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.530
venues from San Francisco
because it's near by me.

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:02.510
And we were able to do that
all with a segment list.

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:03.820
We were able to create
different sections.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:07.640
And we thought that that was
the awesome solution out of

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.271
all the other ones we were
throwing around.

00:37:10.271 --> 00:37:14.900
GUENTHER BEYER: Speaking of
empty screens, you will have

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:16.310
to deal with empty screens
eventually.

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:18.550
There are a lot of apps that are
loading content from the

00:37:18.550 --> 00:37:20.880
web and, at times, you just
don't have a web connection.

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:25.040
So how do you deal with
empty screens?

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.260
This was the first iteration
of GigBeat's empty screens.

00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.270
And to be honest, they are
really, really boring and not

00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:30.080
really informative.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:33.110
And we have a lot of those.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:36.770
And actually we decided that,
if you can't really inform--

00:37:36.770 --> 00:37:38.810
because that is obviously what
you want to do in such an

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:39.660
application--

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.800
at least entertain to
a certain extent.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:45.530
You want to have your users
stay within the app and at

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:48.000
least enjoy the empty screens,
even though they aren't really

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:48.900
that beautiful.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:51.470
And so we created a couple of
really small illustrations and

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:54.250
tried to improve the copy and
just tried to give a certain

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:57.420
feeling across it, a little bit
of fun in between, while

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.610
information is loading or while
they have to access some

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:02.390
kind of a log-in or anything
like that.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:06.900
So we think these turned out
pretty nicely in the overall

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:08.305
context of the application.

00:38:08.305 --> 00:38:09.890
MICHAEL NOVAK: The other really
awesome thing we added

00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:11.680
was we added some actions
at the bottom.

00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.190
So when you're on the empty
screen of Last.fm and you

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.770
haven't either logged-in
or you don't have any

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:17.760
recommendations, it will
actually say, hey, you can

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.470
log-in to Last.fm.

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:20.830
And this screen will populate
with some artists.

00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:23.020
So we really tried to take
advantage of as much of the

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:26.570
screen as possible to make it
easy for the user to actually

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:30.305
get benefit from that screen.

00:38:30.305 --> 00:38:31.585
GUENTHER BEYER: That's
yours, right?

00:38:31.585 --> 00:38:32.460
MICHAEL NOVAK: Right.

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:33.500
Notifications.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:37.240
So GigBeat, obviously, does a
lot of work for you when you

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.890
don't use the application.

00:38:39.890 --> 00:38:42.340
But one of the interesting
things that we were playing

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.020
with, especially when we were
doing bigger releases, was how

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:48.010
do we let the user know
there's new content?

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:51.670
You might not actually update
the application the first time

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:53.440
you-- you might not use the
application the first

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.910
time you update it.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.510
So it could be days or weeks
before you actually

00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:58.830
venture into it.

00:38:58.830 --> 00:39:00.270
In most cases, you'll
venture into it

00:39:00.270 --> 00:39:01.020
because you have a need.

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:02.740
You're trying to get
to certain content.

00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.220
So we didn't want to just pop
up a dialogue or pop up a

00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:07.250
screen that says,
hey, what's new?

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:09.410
By the way, thanks for
using the app.

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:16.130
We wanted to really be as
unobtrusive as possible.

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:18.180
So you can go to
the next slide.

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:23.130
So what we were doing was we'd
actually pop up a notification

00:39:23.130 --> 00:39:24.185
for major releases.

00:39:24.185 --> 00:39:26.400
I want to emphasize major
releases, because bug fix

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.100
updates, like getting a
notification every time you

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.890
open the app would be kind
of annoying, I think.

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:32.740
So we wanted to make sure that
we were definitely doing this

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.320
just for major--

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.040
we've got new features that
we definitely think

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:37.360
you're going to love.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.200
So when you first open the
application, instead of

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.610
actually getting in your way and
showing you that Welcome

00:39:41.610 --> 00:39:44.330
screen first, we actually just
leave the app the way it is

00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:45.390
and pop the notification up.

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:47.580
So that way, once you're done
looking for whatever it is you

00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:50.360
came into the app to look for,
you can actually, at your

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.490
leisure, check out what we've
got that's new in our

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:54.802
application.

00:39:54.802 --> 00:39:57.710
GUENTHER BEYER: We might add
that you have to create about

00:39:57.710 --> 00:40:00.910
four sizes and three different
styles for every notification

00:40:00.910 --> 00:40:01.890
icon that you are creating.

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:04.050
So be prepared.

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:06.080
MICHAEL NOVAK: This is actually
my favorite feature

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.490
that we added in our latest
release that's

00:40:08.490 --> 00:40:10.100
on the market today.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:13.300
We do playback notifications.

00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:17.830
So concerts is music, but you're
not always at concerts.

00:40:17.830 --> 00:40:21.170
You're listening to music
on the go, commuting.

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:24.750
So it's awesome to find out
about the artist that you're

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:26.830
actually listening to when
you're listening to it.

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:30.570
So what we do here is we pop
up a silent notification

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:33.020
during playback, if that artist
is actually going to be

00:40:33.020 --> 00:40:33.990
in your city.

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:37.020
And we do it silently because
the worst thing in the world

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:40.440
would be to pop up a
notification about some

00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:43.940
secondary data for the artist
and cause a little beep in the

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.040
middle of the song.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.260
That would just frustrate me.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:49.180
So we wanted to make sure that
we provided the information so

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.590
that the user would be notified
that the artist is

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:53.240
coming to their city.

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.120
But we didn't want to interrupt
the actual process

00:40:55.120 --> 00:40:57.290
that they're doing, which is
listening to the music.

00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:00.040
So yeah, we were definitely
being polite, silent

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.210
notifications.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:03.990
And you get the information
without being bothered.

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.950
Event details.

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:13.060
So event details
is interesting.

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:13.990
You've got the venue.

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:15.650
They've got the date,
the time, tickets.

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:18.870
It's pretty basic information,
for the most part.

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:20.960
And in our first couple
of iterations,

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:21.810
it was really boring.

00:41:21.810 --> 00:41:22.980
We just did a lot of text.

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.680
There wasn't really much
breakup in the UI.

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:26.270
There wasn't much color.

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:28.780
I mean, there was really a
lot of the basic colors.

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.770
So we decided let's
stick an avatar in

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:33.530
there for the headliner.

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:36.940
And let's throw some icons into
the list to really break

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:38.210
up the flow of all the text.

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:39.320
But it still didn't
seem right.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:43.320
It felt like it was just
a lot of empty--

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.240
the space didn't work for me.

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:47.340
I didn't like this version
very much.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.760
But what you see is
we actually--

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.010
go to the next slide---

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:56.110
what you actually see
is bigger pictures.

00:41:56.110 --> 00:41:57.140
I love this screen.

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:57.920
This is one of my favorites.

00:41:57.920 --> 00:42:00.440
I think I stared at this screen
for 20 minutes when we

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.090
actually got it running.

00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:03.130
It was amazing.

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:05.750
And so we did a nice
large photo for the

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:06.980
headliner of the event.

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.540
And then we added in the
supporting artists as well.

00:42:10.540 --> 00:42:13.450
So you'll actually get two
photos there, if there's only

00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:14.400
three artists playing.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.810
And then, if there's any more
than three artists, we'll use

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:19.875
that other space to allow
you to click through to

00:42:19.875 --> 00:42:20.990
see the full list.

00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:24.860
But the event date is actually
really awesome, because this

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:28.360
is where we were able to use
various weights of Roboto to

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:33.060
really drive the emphasis on
the date, where we do the

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:37.710
actual day in a large, thinner
font, and then the rest of the

00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:40.500
date in a smaller,
bolder font.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.670
Which was a nice break up from
the other text that comes

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:45.080
below the photos.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:47.560
We were able to put the venue
information, check-in

00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:50.140
capabilities, and
getting tickets.

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:54.350
And then, on the tablet screen,
we had some room to

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:57.250
throw some more photos in,
some more information.

00:42:57.250 --> 00:42:58.900
And we actually had the list
right on the side, so you

00:42:58.900 --> 00:43:02.050
could just go through each of
the different events and see

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:04.486
the information right
next to it.

00:43:04.486 --> 00:43:05.680
GUENTHER BEYER: If you're
thinking about this

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.100
application, I think this
is about events.

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:09.150
This is about live music.

00:43:09.150 --> 00:43:11.980
And live music is
exciting, right?

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:14.550
These screens were not
really that exciting.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:15.800
They're pretty boring.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:16.790
But I think we figured
it out pretty

00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:17.640
nicely with these screens.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:19.540
Because these photos, they
actually are exciting.

00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:23.570
You actually want to see
these guys live, right?

00:43:23.570 --> 00:43:25.110
OK, the next one's the
artist details.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:29.050
And I think you will love this
one as well, because the old

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:32.200
version of GigBeat, it just had
a list of-- well, it had

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.300
the artist name and
then a list of its

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:35.610
gigs that were upcoming.

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:37.750
And we wanted to add a little
bit more to these screens.

00:43:37.750 --> 00:43:42.840
So I sketched up this pretty
rough thing here.

00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:43.640
And I showed it to Mike.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:44.510
And he really liked it.

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:48.480
But he hated it at the same
time, I guess, because--

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.070
fun fact--

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:52.240
Marco here is the creator of
that BeautifulPeople's

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.520
People's app from Android 4.0.

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.160
And we wanted to do something
similar with

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.650
that carousel slider.

00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:59.470
And they can swipe from
left to right

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.700
and from top to bottom.

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.250
As it turned out, that
code was just

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:05.700
working for Android 4.0.

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:08.970
And GigBeat is supporting
2.1 and upwards.

00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:12.370
So that poor guy over there had
to rewrite that whole code

00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:13.840
to make it work on
all the systems.

00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:15.820
MICHAEL NOVAK: It took a couple
of weeks, but it was

00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:16.460
well worth it.

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:19.200
It's one of my other favorite
screens in the application.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:21.840
And we were really able to--

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.460
the list looks great.

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.640
You've got nice, big photos.

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.190
We were able to break up--

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:28.290
The other part of the problem
was we couldn't figure out how

00:44:28.290 --> 00:44:30.750
to get other artist information,
like a bio, in

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:31.970
with the tour dates.

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:34.660
The previous screen showed the
avatar, the artist's name and

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:35.970
a star, and then the
list of events.

00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:38.390
So it's like we didn't want you
to have to click to get to

00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:41.160
a profile and then click to get
back to the events, so we

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.580
were really trying to figure out
the best way to do that.

00:44:43.580 --> 00:44:44.830
And this was just perfect.

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:47.610
When I saw the Contacts
application and then the

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:50.095
sketches, it was the
perfect solution.

00:44:50.095 --> 00:44:51.880
You're able to swipe
back and forth.

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.210
There's no pause at a screen
going backward or forward.

00:44:55.210 --> 00:44:57.586
It really worked perfectly,
I think.

00:44:57.586 --> 00:44:59.060
GUENTHER BEYER: You want
to add something

00:44:59.060 --> 00:44:59.980
for the icon set?

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:00.610
MICHAEL NOVAK: Yes.

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:02.675
So we actually have an icon
set available as well at

00:45:02.675 --> 00:45:03.925
androidicons.com.

00:45:05.310 --> 00:45:08.570
So every application that we've
been working on, all the

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:11.380
icons that we put into them,
we're actually just putting

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:14.370
into this set.

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:17.930
It's how we met, actually, was
Guenther put out an icon set

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:20.910
that I took advantage of for
some open source applications.

00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:22.160
Because as a developer,
I don't really

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.110
design icons very well.

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:26.430
I know which icons I like in
certain places, but I can't

00:45:26.430 --> 00:45:27.110
design them.

00:45:27.110 --> 00:45:29.010
So it's a really great resource
for developers.

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:31.881
I recommend everybody
check it out.

00:45:31.881 --> 00:45:32.850
MARCO PAGLIA: That's it?

00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:33.140
Thanks.

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:34.120
MICHAEL NOVAK: Yeah.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:34.591
Thank you.

00:45:34.591 --> 00:45:41.656
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:41.656 --> 00:45:45.570
MARCO PAGLIA: So I have a
question for the crowd.

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:49.500
Who does think that the Square
application and the GigBeat

00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:50.750
application look the same?

00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:54.370
No one.

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:54.670
MICHAEL NOVAK: Nobody.

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:57.660
MARCO PAGLIA: As you see, you
have so many ways to make your

00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:00.490
application unique.

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:02.520
It's just beautiful.

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:06.090
I'd like to ask a question
to our guests

00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:07.450
here, just as a start.

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:09.460
Then we can get to
the audience and

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:10.570
to our group here.

00:46:10.570 --> 00:46:12.165
Let me get them a microphone.

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:18.340
How do you come up
with that color?

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:19.950
MICHAEL NOVAK: Well,
I'm color blind.

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:21.530
So I'm going to throw that
one right to you.

00:46:21.530 --> 00:46:23.060
GUENTHER BEYER: Please
ask again.

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:23.880
I didn't catch that.

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:25.280
MARCO PAGLIA: How did you
come up with that color?

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:28.560
GUENTHER BEYER: That color?

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.750
I'm not quite sure, man.

00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:30.705
It just looks good, right?

00:46:30.705 --> 00:46:33.000
Does it?

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.680
About choosing color, there's
just some kind of gut feeling.

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:36.460
There's not a lot about it.

00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:39.290
As I said, you don't want to
have a lot of color fighting

00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:41.370
for attention and fighting
[INAUDIBLE].

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:44.350
Well, for example, the Google
logo has four colors, which is

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:45.511
a little bit too much.

00:46:45.511 --> 00:46:47.395
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:47.395 --> 00:46:50.460
GUENTHER BEYER: But well, in
the end, you really want to

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.110
keep down the amount of colors
and just select some for

00:46:53.110 --> 00:46:53.530
highlights.

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:55.030
And we just thought
that one for

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.900
highlights would be enough.

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:59.850
And I think a pinkish,
reddish thing is

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:01.240
a pretty good highlight.

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.513
MICHAEL NOVAK: It took
a little while for

00:47:02.513 --> 00:47:03.240
me to get used it.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.510
When I first saw it,
I was like, whoa.

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:06.920
Wow, that's different.

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:09.950
And then, once I started using
it, and I was like, wow, this

00:47:09.950 --> 00:47:13.840
is amazing, because it added
just enough color to

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:14.740
really stand out.

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:18.170
And in certain places, like in
the carousel slider, it's the

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:20.170
thick header, and it's
the thin line

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:21.040
underneath the pictures.

00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:23.360
It really adds a lot to it.

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:27.260
MARCO PAGLIA: OK, we have a
long line of questions.

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:28.510
Let's try to get to them.

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:34.830
AUDIENCE: Two very short ones.

00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:38.716
Why dashboard pattern, instead
of action bar lists?

00:47:38.716 --> 00:47:41.950
MICHAEL NOVAK: So we actually
developed this application

00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:44.800
when, I think, it was Froyo or
Gingerbread was available.

00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.270
So the action bar pattern, we're
still really developing,

00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:49.340
which is why I think the
initial version really

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:50.710
emphasizes on dashboard.

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:53.170
We decided not to change that
because we felt that those

00:47:53.170 --> 00:47:58.240
four icons really stood to our
brand and the message we're

00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.460
trying to send with
our application.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:02.580
And we really were able to have
fun with those icons.

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:05.920
And we only had four, so we felt
like it worked for us, in

00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:08.010
particular.

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:11.020
GUENTHER BEYER: Can I add that
there is a lot of hate going

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:13.460
on about the dashboard right
now, because a lot of people

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:14.970
think that a dashboard,
in general, is bad.

00:48:14.970 --> 00:48:18.670
But a dashboard makes a lot of
sense, if you have a couple of

00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:20.800
distinct pieces of information
that are--

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:24.130
but there is not one single one
that is more important.

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:26.150
So I think a dashboard makes a
lot of sense, especially in

00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:27.233
that context.

00:48:27.233 --> 00:48:28.220
AUDIENCE: OK, yeah.

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:31.440
I just think, with the list, it
allows you to put featured

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:33.510
content right up front as
soon as you get into the

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:34.230
application.

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:37.220
But everybody has reasons.

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:40.950
The other thing was using
notifications when the

00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:42.720
application's updated.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.760
Do you find that
spammy at all?

00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:48.020
Or why not just a banner when
they open the application

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:49.250
after an update or something?

00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:51.360
MICHAEL NOVAK: So we didn't
actually think of a banner.

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:56.300
But in terms of spammy,
our major updates

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:57.880
don't come very often.

00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.900
We're not like every time we
update and say, hey, we

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.060
changed that text so that
it's spelled correctly.

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:04.710
Or that crash that you noticed,
we fixed that.

00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:08.220
It's like that stuff's in the
market listing, so we decided

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:09.920
let's not use the notifications
for that.

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:13.770
But when we have a lot of big
features, like a redesign, we

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:18.060
added some bio information,
that's stuff that, I think, is

00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:19.140
pretty important.

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:22.970
And it comes once every couple
of months, really, I think.

00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:23.780
AUDIENCE: OK, good.

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:24.050
Thanks.

00:49:24.050 --> 00:49:24.670
MICHAEL NOVAK: Sure.

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:28.726
AUDIENCE: Do you use GPS
or course location?

00:49:28.726 --> 00:49:30.760
MICHAEL NOVAK: So we actually
use course.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:34.000
We don't really need fine
location, because most of the

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.730
information from the API side
of things is metro areas.

00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:42.346
So we don't need that
much from the GPS.

00:49:42.346 --> 00:49:46.650
AUDIENCE: So I installed
that app to follow

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:47.560
along with you guys.

00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:48.700
And it looked pretty good.

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:52.350
I was curious on if you guys
plan on integrating Google

00:49:52.350 --> 00:49:53.840
Music with it in the
future, though.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:54.720
MICHAEL NOVAK: That's awesome.

00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:57.160
AUDIENCE: Because I saw that
stuff in Drop box and a couple

00:49:57.160 --> 00:49:59.135
of other methods for it.

00:49:59.135 --> 00:49:59.930
MICHAEL NOVAK: Yeah.

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:02.750
That's like the email that I've
gotten the most ever, I

00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:04.670
think, was, where's Google
Music support?

00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:07.380
And as soon as there's an
official way for us to get to

00:50:07.380 --> 00:50:09.580
the Artists list-- because
right now, the content

00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:11.940
provider on the device
doesn't return your

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:13.060
Google Music artists--

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:15.610
once that's actually available
for us, we want to

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:16.690
dive in and do it.

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:18.490
But we don't really want to try
and hack it, because then,

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:20.290
if it breaks or if there's
something else going on, we

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:21.450
really don't want to break
the user experience.

00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:23.970
We feel like that might
be more frustrating.

00:50:23.970 --> 00:50:26.584
So we decided to stay
away from it.

00:50:26.584 --> 00:50:27.392
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:50:27.392 --> 00:50:27.796
Look forward to it.

00:50:27.796 --> 00:50:29.410
MICHAEL NOVAK: Thanks.

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:33.905
AUDIENCE: In terms of user
experience and design, how do

00:50:33.905 --> 00:50:35.520
you deal with all
their platforms?

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:38.190
Do you think it's better to
style everything to have the

00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:42.930
same user experience across
other devices as well?

00:50:42.930 --> 00:50:46.180
Or do you leverage whatever the
platform is offering you?

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:50.640
For instance, take the example
of dialogs or edit text or

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:53.215
check boxes, do you have
the same style for all?

00:50:53.215 --> 00:50:56.280
Or how do you deal with that?

00:50:56.280 --> 00:51:00.730
MICHAEL NOVAK: For GigBeat, we
style the dialogues, but we

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:03.070
use wherever the platform
base is.

00:51:03.070 --> 00:51:05.490
So for Holo, we use the Holo
dialogue as a base.

00:51:05.490 --> 00:51:08.980
And for Gingerbread and lower,
we use the regular theme as a

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:09.920
dialogue base.

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:11.190
And we do change the color.

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:15.330
But we didn't port back a lot
of the drawable assets like

00:51:15.330 --> 00:51:18.480
the progress bar or the progress
indicator, we just

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:20.060
used whatever is on
the platform for

00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:21.450
that particular device.

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:23.162
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:51:23.162 --> 00:51:24.550
ERIC BURKE: I actually
wanted to mention

00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:26.250
something about that.

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:28.900
One thing you're going to find
is, once you start customizing

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:32.670
one thing, you are all-in.

00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:36.290
Just as an example, some of the
Motorola phones that are

00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:40.490
using Motorola's skin, we found
that we had tweaked the

00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:42.700
button color, but we didn't
tweak the text color.

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:45.170
So we ended up with
white on white.

00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:48.030
So once you start messing with
customizations in the theme,

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:49.890
you pretty much have to
customize everything.

00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:53.210
Otherwise, you're going to get
some nasty surprises when you

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:55.580
go to some of the
carrier skins.

00:51:59.824 --> 00:52:03.290
AUDIENCE: So your color
scheme is great.

00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:05.853
You guys used pink and shades
of gray to really make your

00:52:05.853 --> 00:52:07.180
app look distinctive.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.820
But you also have a very
picture-heavy app with the

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:11.250
artist pics and everything
like that.

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:13.010
And they come in with
their own colors.

00:52:13.010 --> 00:52:15.670
And since these are musical
artists, they're likely to be

00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:19.500
loud, possibly obnoxious colors,
which could conflict

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:22.680
with the ones that you have,
with your pink and grays.

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:24.510
So have you guys put
any thought into

00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:25.720
that sort of issue?

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:29.060
And is there anything
you can do to try to

00:52:29.060 --> 00:52:32.630
reduce that loud contrast?

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:33.410
GUENTHER BEYER: Well, yeah.

00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:36.760
That is because we turned down
about every color, except for

00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:38.980
these really, really important
highlights.

00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:41.380
Because then these colors don't

00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:42.340
interfere with each other.

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:44.520
And if you're having a lot of
pictures, then you might not

00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.520
need any color at all, right?

00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:49.850
So but if there is still one or
two really important marks

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:52.920
within the UI, then you might
highlight them, except that

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.850
color that you have
used throughout

00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:55.990
all the other screens.

00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:57.370
And that is pink, in our case.

00:52:57.370 --> 00:52:59.490
MICHAEL NOVAK: Yeah, it's
definitely an accent color.

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:01.760
So really, it's meant
to emphasize certain

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:02.460
parts of the UI.

00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:05.570
And it's really carefully used,
I think, throughout the

00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:07.182
application for that reason.

00:53:07.182 --> 00:53:08.600
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:10.045
MICHAEL NOVAK: Sure.

00:53:10.045 --> 00:53:13.890
AUDIENCE: This is a question for
both GigBeat and Square.

00:53:13.890 --> 00:53:16.720
I noticed that your application
supports a variety

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:19.758
of Android versions and also
a wide variety of screen

00:53:19.758 --> 00:53:21.010
resolutions.

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:23.610
Would you like to share with
us your experiences in

00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:27.650
supporting multiple versions of
Androids and also different

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:28.660
hardware specs?

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:29.060
Thank you.

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:29.950
MICHAEL NOVAK: Sure.

00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:33.050
It was certainly a challenge at
the beginning, because we

00:53:33.050 --> 00:53:34.600
were trying to figure
out what all these

00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:36.020
differences really were.

00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:40.480
But what it came down to is
there's a lot of resources

00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:44.400
available to abstract away
some of those different

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:48.570
nuances, like when things
get deprecated.

00:53:48.570 --> 00:53:51.790
For example, some of the
notification stuff was

00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:53.500
deprecated in how
you create it.

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:57.950
The action bar is certainly
something that's introduced in

00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:59.600
Honeycomb, and is not available
on Gingerbread.

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:02.800
So we really tried to abstract
away as much of the resources

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:07.070
as possible, so we could plug
them in where they made sense.

00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:10.950
Different static classes to
lazy-load APIs that are

00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:15.350
available on newer devices
versus older.

00:54:15.350 --> 00:54:17.370
It's the same thing with layout
resources for different

00:54:17.370 --> 00:54:18.440
screen sizes.

00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:22.170
We took advantage of values
files and the dimensions file

00:54:22.170 --> 00:54:25.180
to actually keep all of our
dimensions there, so that our

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:26.600
layouts weren't repetitive.

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:29.240
And that allowed us to scale
pretty easily, without a lot

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.570
of work and testing and really
having to worry about if we

00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:35.900
changed the right file or not
and made the size correct.

00:54:39.844 --> 00:54:40.830
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:40.830 --> 00:54:42.309
MICHAEL NOVAK: Sure.

00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:43.720
AUDIENCE: Hi, guys.

00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:47.970
I was wondering if you had any
plans to open source the

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:50.320
Contacts implementation
that you had written.

00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:51.105
MICHAEL NOVAK: Actually, yeah.

00:54:51.105 --> 00:54:51.760
That was a slide.

00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.600
And then I got really busy.

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:53.850
So yeah, it--

00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:54.300
GUENTHER BEYER: I forgot that.

00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:54.920
Sorry.

00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:58.500
MICHAEL NOVAK: Yeah, we are
actually planning to open up

00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.830
the modifications that we made
to get that to run back to

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:03.680
2.1, hopefully, in the
next couple of weeks.

00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.630
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:05.010
Thank you.

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:05.390
MICHAEL NOVAK: Sure.

00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:07.370
AUDIENCE: Where can
I look for that?

00:55:07.370 --> 00:55:08.250
MICHAEL NOVAK: Probably--

00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:10.430
GUENTHER BEYER: I think you
might want to follow one of

00:55:10.430 --> 00:55:12.390
our Google+ streams, because
we have so many.

00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:14.170
But we are cross-sharing
as much as possible.

00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:14.860
MICHAEL NOVAK: Yeah.

00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:15.120
GUENTHER BEYER: Which
will eventually--

00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.100
MICHAEL NOVAK: Definitely, one
of the ones that's on the

00:55:16.100 --> 00:55:18.610
screen now, or one of
our personal ones.

00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:19.200
We'll be spamming that.

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.920
AUDIENCE: Thanks, a lot.

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:24.216
MARCO PAGLIA: OK,
last question.

00:55:24.216 --> 00:55:27.120
AUDIENCE: I really love what you
guys did with the tablet

00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:28.060
landing screen.

00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:29.270
You have the dashboard--

00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.920
MICHAEL NOVAK: Thank you.

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:32.860
AUDIENCE: --features and
the content there.

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:35.740
So my question is also for
the Android design team.

00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:40.700
Does the dashboard still work
on tablets, considering you

00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:43.890
only have just icons?

00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.900
MICHAEL NOVAK: As far as GigBeat
goes, I think it

00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:49.770
worked out quite nicely.

00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:51.680
It allowed us to use big
pictures and take up the

00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:54.550
majority of the screen for
content, but still have those

00:55:54.550 --> 00:55:56.310
dashboard items.

00:55:56.310 --> 00:55:59.290
Instead of a grid, just list
it on the right-hand side.

00:55:59.290 --> 00:56:03.400
So I think, if the method fits
for the application and it

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.190
works for the implementation
that you have, you can get

00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:09.005
pretty creative with the ways
to actually make it work.

00:56:09.005 --> 00:56:09.495
RICHARD FULCHER: Yeah.

00:56:09.495 --> 00:56:11.140
I think that's the
right answer.

00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:14.680
In the tablet, instead of having
this dedicated screen

00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:17.070
that serves that navigation
function, you can just divide

00:56:17.070 --> 00:56:21.800
the real estate up and have a
panel that is the emotional or

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:24.880
logical peer to it,
but presents it

00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:25.800
in a different way.

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:27.340
It doesn't have to be
the four up pattern.

00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:28.420
You can actually do
lots of different

00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:30.750
things in that space.

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:32.450
MICHAEL NOVAK: One of the
takeaways that we had with

00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:36.450
developing GigBeat was there's
a lot of creativity.

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:37.770
You can do a lot of interesting
things.

00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:41.080
And we follow the patterns just

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.120
about as much as possible.

00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:45.220
I think I'm probably annoying
at sometimes when I'm like,

00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:46.820
oh, that's not exactly right.

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:48.160
We should do it this way.

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:52.440
Or my implementation isn't
exactly pretty enough.

00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:54.580
So there's a lot of going
back and forth.

00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:58.530
But as you can see, we really
emphasize trying to find as

00:56:58.530 --> 00:57:02.560
much creativity without making
the application foreign for

00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:03.750
the users of the device.

00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:04.360
GUENTHER BEYER: Yeah.

00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:06.350
Maybe that's why we showed a
couple of these sketches in

00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:07.320
the early prototypes.

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:10.890
And the application evolved over
time because there was

00:57:10.890 --> 00:57:13.100
not really one pattern for
a good user experience.

00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:14.230
But you have to try
out a couple of

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:15.310
those as much as possible.

00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:16.610
Do some sketching.

00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:17.740
Do some real prototyping.

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:19.270
Do some wireframings.

00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:21.232
And then, eventually, you will
find a good solution.

00:57:21.232 --> 00:57:22.648
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:57:22.648 --> 00:57:25.500
MARCO PAGLIA: OK, let's give a
round of applause to GigBeat.

00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:36.214
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:36.214 --> 00:57:37.464
MARCO PAGLIA: All right.

00:57:41.130 --> 00:57:42.840
This is where things become
interesting now.

00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:45.720
We're going to have
this workshop.

00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:49.160
And we never tried it before, so
you'll have to bear with us

00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:50.570
a little bit.

00:57:50.570 --> 00:57:51.770
But this is what we're
going to do.

00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:54.700
We'll have five developers that
are going to be coming up

00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:57.240
on stage one at a time.

00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:00.770
They're going to have one minute
to just run us through

00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:04.028
their application, just to have
a little bit of context.

00:58:04.028 --> 00:58:05.924
[LAUGHTER]

00:58:05.924 --> 00:58:11.148
MARCO PAGLIA: And for that,
we brought the gong.

00:58:11.148 --> 00:58:13.016
[RINGS GONG]

00:58:13.016 --> 00:58:13.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:15.200
MARCO PAGLIA: Put out
for the gong.

00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:19.570
Thank you, gong.

00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:24.590
And yeah, let's try to keep
the atmosphere informal.

00:58:24.590 --> 00:58:26.650
We really want to have
interesting discussions with

00:58:26.650 --> 00:58:27.570
these applications.

00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:29.990
And hopefully, we're going
to get some nice

00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:31.630
questions as well.

00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:33.590
So let's start with
the first one.

00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:38.450
The first one is going to
be Droid of the Day.

00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:40.900
And I'm going to get here
on stage Mike Wolfson.

00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:42.132
Please, give a round
of applause.

00:58:42.132 --> 00:58:46.992
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:46.992 --> 00:58:48.610
MARCO PAGLIA: Let me
get my slides on.

00:58:59.590 --> 00:59:01.850
MIKE WOLFSON: So good morning,
good afternoon, I guess.

00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:02.750
My name is Mike Wolfson.

00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:05.130
My app is Droid of the Day.

00:59:05.130 --> 00:59:07.230
The concept is designed
to be simple.

00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:09.230
And the app is designed
to be simple.

00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:13.160
Basically, it is a App of the
Day app that every day you get

00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:17.220
a notification of a app that is
hand-picked either by me or

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.600
with help from my community.

00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:22.220
You can choose to
check it out.

00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:25.000
Or you can exit out.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.180
This is the home screen.

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:28.830
If you choose to check
out an app, you will

00:59:28.830 --> 00:59:29.820
just launch the app.

00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:33.260
And we'll, obviously, go into
this in more detail.

00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:36.580
I don't make any money on the
app, which is probably a

00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:39.610
business model familiar to a
lot of people in this room.

00:59:39.610 --> 00:59:40.920
It's just something
I do for fun.

00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:44.300
I did want to mention one of the
reasons that I do this is

00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:48.020
to highlight great developers
and to filter good apps up

00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:49.570
that might not be visible
in the market.

00:59:49.570 --> 00:59:52.940
So if you're in the room and you
would like me to feature

00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:55.670
your app, just send
me an email to

00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:57.400
droidoftheday@gmail.com.

00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:01.760
Put hash tag I/O 12, or
something in there, so I know

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:02.670
where you came from.

01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:05.270
But I'm always looking for
great apps to feature.

01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:06.812
And I think that's
under a minute.

01:00:06.812 --> 01:00:08.080
RICHARD FULCHER:
That was good.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:08.530
Thank you.

01:00:08.530 --> 01:00:09.230
Thank you, very much.

01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:10.480
MIKE WOLFSON: Thank you.

01:00:12.569 --> 01:00:15.096
MARCO PAGLIA: So which screen
do you want to start from?

01:00:15.096 --> 01:00:17.305
RICHARD FULCHER: Let's just
do the first screen.

01:00:17.305 --> 01:00:17.700
Yeah.

01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:21.160
So this is kind of
the high wire act

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.670
portion of the program.

01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:24.560
So we're just going to walk
through some of the

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:25.420
screens of the app.

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:27.300
We're going to talk about things
we like and things that

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:29.100
we think, maybe, could be
improved a little bit from the

01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:30.320
design standpoint.

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.490
I've got the mic here.

01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:33.040
But we've got a mic
in the back row

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.210
for the other designers.

01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:37.220
And we're just going to make
this a little Wild West,

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:38.422
loosey-goosey.

01:00:38.422 --> 01:00:42.640
So I wanted to start by just
talking about a few of the

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:45.050
things I really like about
this application.

01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:46.420
And first and foremost--

01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:48.200
maybe, Marco, if you could
advance one slide--

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:55.540
this app has a real voice.

01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:58.740
The Droid of the Day comment
that comes in when you go and

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:02.770
look at a particular application
is very editorial,

01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:05.060
very genuine, very human.

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:08.060
And that's something that's
actually pretty important in

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:08.920
an app like this.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:12.110
It's not just a piece
of market speak.

01:01:12.110 --> 01:01:14.790
I know you're hoping, maybe,
you could get out of San

01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:17.580
Francisco without getting this
hippy-dippy emotional crap.

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:21.070
But it's actually really handy
to go to an app that's

01:01:21.070 --> 01:01:24.110
actually expressing an opinion
that isn't just some of the

01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:25.970
market speak that you may
have experienced in the

01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:28.170
last couple of days.

01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:29.540
So I really like that.

01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:34.250
I really like how the app
is very tightly focused.

01:01:34.250 --> 01:01:38.380
It's not today's app in six
different categories.

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:41.570
It doesn't ask a lot
from the user.

01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:44.660
The user doesn't need to
remember to check it.

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:46.090
He will get a notification
reminder when

01:01:46.090 --> 01:01:47.900
a new app is available.

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.280
They don't feel obliged
to come every day, if

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.270
they don't have to.

01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:54.080
There's a History view that
they can dig back through.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:56.670
They can choose to consume it on
a weekly basis instead, if

01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:58.240
they prefer.

01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.580
And it's got ways for
them to interact.

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:01.450
They can rate the content.

01:02:01.450 --> 01:02:03.270
They can make suggestions,
as we saw before.

01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:05.120
So I think all of those
are really great

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.660
things in the app.

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:08.220
So good job.

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:08.535
Great.

01:02:08.535 --> 01:02:09.726
MIKE WOLFSON: Thanks.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:11.040
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.175
MIKE WOLFSON: But.

01:02:12.175 --> 01:02:13.660
RICHARD FULCHER: But.

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:14.650
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:16.140
RICHARD FULCHER: No, no no.

01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:17.540
So let's go back one slide.

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:19.050
Let's go back to
the dashboard.

01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:21.030
I know we talked about
the dashboard in

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:23.800
GigBeat's context as well.

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:26.630
And I think this might be an
opportunity where we can even

01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:29.180
play that focus aspect
a little bit more

01:02:29.180 --> 01:02:30.810
strongly for the app.

01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:33.290
I think you've got two
operations here, which are

01:02:33.290 --> 01:02:35.890
really important, the Today's
app, which you naturally want

01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:38.750
to drive users to very directly,
and the history is

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:40.140
really important too.

01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:42.150
But I think a lot of the
other ones could

01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:44.770
possibly be put into--

01:02:44.770 --> 01:02:46.820
if you were to adapt the action
bar pattern, they can

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:48.800
go into the Overflow menu.

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:51.670
And maybe you could just bypass
the need to even have

01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:57.000
this dashboard, and just drive
right to the Droid of the Day.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.100
Rachel, I know in your talk this
morning you were talking

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:02.350
about what's the hero
screen of your app.

01:03:02.350 --> 01:03:04.170
This seems like a good
example of that.

01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:05.880
That Droid App page should
be the hero.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.720
And it should be the first
thing you get to.

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:13.430
So on the next screen,
we've got--

01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:16.520
this screen is the type of
screen that I always find

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:19.100
challenging, because just
the amount of content.

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:20.160
And the content has value.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.650
It's not noise content.

01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:24.200
You're really just trying to
deliver all the things the

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.400
user could want to know about
this application into one

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:28.800
piece of canvas.

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:32.100
And I think you get a lot
of things really right.

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:35.440
The most important content is
at the top of the screen.

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:37.810
And generally, the less
important stuff goes down.

01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:39.900
And I really especially like
how you're using the

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.440
collapse-expand for the
market description.

01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.990
That's a block of text that you
don't really have a good

01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:48.090
sense how long that's
going to be.

01:03:48.090 --> 01:03:52.780
So using that control there
fixes it in place.

01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:55.620
A user can dig into it, but it
doesn't disrupt getting at the

01:03:55.620 --> 01:03:58.220
other important stuff that's
lower on the screen.

01:04:00.830 --> 01:04:01.710
One thing--

01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:05.100
if you can go to the
next slide, Marco--

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:07.030
that same control winds
up getting used

01:04:07.030 --> 01:04:10.050
for the screen shots.

01:04:10.050 --> 01:04:13.200
Can you put your device
on the bed again?

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.300
You get to see just a
little bit of a peek

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.530
of the screen shots.

01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:19.140
And you can actually interact
with that peek.

01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:21.350
If they're multiple, you
could scroll or swipe

01:04:21.350 --> 01:04:22.360
through that region.

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:25.240
And then you can expand it up
to open up and walk through

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:27.920
the screen shots that way.

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.900
I think, for the screen shots,
it's probably best to just

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:32.606
expand them all the time.

01:04:32.606 --> 01:04:35.480
You know they're going to take
up some height, but it's a

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.240
fixed amount of height, unlike
the market example where, I

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:41.070
think, it makes perfect sense
to use that expand control.

01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:44.320
So I would consider, maybe,
just moving away from that

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:48.780
control and just showing them at
full height the whole time.

01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:50.750
The other thing that's really
kind of interesting to think

01:04:50.750 --> 01:04:53.980
about on this screen are
all of the actions.

01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:56.000
And again, this is
a challenge.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.260
So you've got the ability to
rate, to download, to share it

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:02.510
with others.

01:05:04.210 --> 01:05:07.260
I think you probably want to
pick one of those actions to

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:09.900
be the primary action
on the screen.

01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:13.980
And it's probably the
Download button.

01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:15.560
To your credit, you give that
to a user in a couple of

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:16.220
different ways.

01:05:16.220 --> 01:05:19.560
They can tap on the App icon
at the top to install it.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.590
Or they can hit the Download
button, which is above the

01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:24.410
fold, so it's visible
on the device.

01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:25.730
But I think you could probably
make it even

01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:27.430
a little bit stronger.

01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:31.490
I'm going to just do some
wireframing here.

01:05:37.050 --> 01:05:38.300
Let's see.

01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:44.080
So one thing you can think
about would be--

01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:51.450
I always draw an action bar
before I draw anything else.

01:05:51.450 --> 01:05:56.450
I'm just hardwired to do that
at this point my life.

01:05:56.450 --> 01:05:59.440
You might be able to take that
Download button and move it up

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.430
more tightly with
the App icon.

01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:04.240
Instead of having those two
functions that do the same

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:08.080
thing, if you just make this
whole top area a target.

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.300
If this is the name of
the app, we've got

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.610
the big icon there.

01:06:11.610 --> 01:06:14.330
Maybe we have the Download
button--

01:06:14.330 --> 01:06:16.920
Marco, this is actually very
similar to a lot of the stuff

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.600
that you're doing in
the Play Store.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:19.292
MARCO PAGLIA: Mm-hm.

01:06:19.292 --> 01:06:21.850
RICHARD FULCHER: You could even
have the price be part of

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:22.900
that Download button.

01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:24.640
And you present it there.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:27.000
Just to make that top part of
the screen, here's the app,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.420
here's how to get it.

01:06:28.420 --> 01:06:30.890
If you don't even need to read
anything more about it, or if

01:06:30.890 --> 01:06:33.180
the notification told
you enough, hop in.

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:33.620
Get it.

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:34.740
And you're on your way.

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.360
MIKE WOLFSON: Is there any
way to represent--

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:40.110
for the icon, I have that
as a clickable point.

01:06:40.110 --> 01:06:41.980
Is there any visual
representation of some way

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:44.020
that I can inform the
user that that

01:06:44.020 --> 01:06:45.350
is, in fact, clickable?

01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:45.930
It's just an image.

01:06:45.930 --> 01:06:47.616
They don't necessarily know.

01:06:47.616 --> 01:06:48.840
RICHARD FULCHER: Yeah.

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:51.210
That's something we struggle
with a little bit, too.

01:06:51.210 --> 01:06:55.010
For something like when we do
quick contacts, we decorate it

01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:59.210
a little bit in one of the
corners, just to hint that

01:06:59.210 --> 01:07:02.720
this is something that isn't
just a graphic element.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:06.310
The other thing you can
do is you could just--

01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:08.790
the way that you wrap
that space.

01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:11.620
And maybe it's less about
turning the image specifically

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:14.485
into a target, and more about
this whole area is a target

01:07:14.485 --> 01:07:16.565
and the action associated
with it.

01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:18.120
MIKE WOLFSON: Yeah, that's what
comes to mind is I just

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:22.460
make that whole area
clickable as a--

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:23.220
RICHARD FULCHER: Yeah.

01:07:23.220 --> 01:07:24.445
MIKE WOLFSON: That view.

01:07:24.445 --> 01:07:26.190
RICHARD FULCHER: Cool.

01:07:26.190 --> 01:07:28.970
A couple of other things, just
on this screen, really quick.

01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:33.130
Now that I've taken Download and
moved it away from Share,

01:07:33.130 --> 01:07:36.760
we need to think about
what to do with that.

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:40.610
A pattern you could consider
would be to use the Share

01:07:40.610 --> 01:07:44.120
Pack, which is something that
goes in the action bar and is

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.670
a two-target action.

01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:50.190
It's got the generic Share icon,
which brings up the list

01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:53.410
of all the different other apps
that you can call out to

01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:54.360
do this share.

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:57.040
And that's the current
behavior.

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.710
And it also brings in just
a shortcut to the

01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:00.260
most recently used.

01:08:00.260 --> 01:08:04.750
So if the user just always
shares via Twitter or Facebook

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:07.140
or Google+--

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:11.366
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:11.366 --> 01:08:13.380
RICHARD FULCHER: --then
you're in great shape.

01:08:19.830 --> 01:08:21.870
I think the only other thing I
want to talk about on that

01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:27.080
screen is at the very bottom
of the screen.

01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:30.180
So maybe if you go to the next
slide, Marco, there is--

01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:31.140
oops, sorry.

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.550
previous.

01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:35.260
Yeah, down at the very tail of
that screen, there are the

01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:36.510
Rate buttons.

01:08:38.819 --> 01:08:40.350
And I think that's a really
great feature.

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:44.470
And I like that you're trying to
use color to differentiate

01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:47.700
between the positive and
the negative actions.

01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:53.229
Peter, do you have any thoughts
on the visual side of

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:56.105
how he could treat those Like
and Dislike buttons?

01:08:56.105 --> 01:08:58.020
PETER INGHAM: Oh, yeah.

01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:00.430
Part of this app, what I really
like, is that you have

01:09:00.430 --> 01:09:01.319
multiple themes.

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:03.710
And it's always hard to
be a visual designer.

01:09:03.710 --> 01:09:06.180
And the way you have to do it
is it's easy to include

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:07.450
everything and have
multiple themes.

01:09:07.450 --> 01:09:09.660
But what you really need to do
it on is figure out your

01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:12.220
brand, and then just go
with that one theme.

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:15.040
So you have colorful
gradients.

01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:18.300
You have brushed metal and these
luster, shiny icons.

01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:21.680
And I'm wondering if you could
actually take what you did in

01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.760
the dashboard with those icons,
those metal icons, and

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.270
explore that theme and made that
the focus of everything.

01:09:26.270 --> 01:09:29.270
And that Today's app would
become a chrome icon, too.

01:09:29.270 --> 01:09:33.300
And then, maybe, your action bar
could be chromed out, too.

01:09:33.300 --> 01:09:36.200
You create this illusion
of life that it doesn't

01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:38.300
necessarily mean that everything
becomes a bookshelf

01:09:38.300 --> 01:09:41.160
or anything like you mimic
the real world.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:44.569
But it actually means that you
create these elements and you

01:09:44.569 --> 01:09:46.560
establish these relationships
where they could actually live

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:47.819
in the same world together.

01:09:47.819 --> 01:09:49.620
And then people aren't--

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:53.109
a constant analogy I always have
is that like I just saw

01:09:53.109 --> 01:09:55.270
Prometheus, the sci-fi movie.

01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:57.770
And when I see aliens, I'm
totally freaked out.

01:09:57.770 --> 01:10:00.710
But then, an hour later, I'm
like, oh, this is just a

01:10:00.710 --> 01:10:04.780
really cruel, weird world that
these monsters live in.

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:05.970
And I'm not freaked
out any more.

01:10:05.970 --> 01:10:10.510
So once you start establishing
these relationships with icons

01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:13.540
and the elements and, as a user,
when you enter it and

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:16.790
you realize that these things
can actually have a

01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:19.470
relationship, it's
a nice feeling.

01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:21.320
You don't feel like you're
shocked every single time you

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.560
turn a page or enter a new
state of the page.

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.030
MIKE WOLFSON: So to just
recapture that, what you

01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:29.400
suggest is I capture in those,
Like, Dislike buttons, some

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:33.110
sort of iconography that matches
the rest of the icons,

01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:35.200
to create that common language
through the app.

01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:37.066
PETER INGHAM: Right.

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:37.930
RICHARD FULCHER: Great.

01:10:37.930 --> 01:10:38.310
Thanks, Peter.

01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:39.546
PETER INGHAM: Yeah.

01:10:39.546 --> 01:10:41.920
MALE SPEAKER: If I could, I
wanted to crash the party and

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.280
mention one other thing.

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.800
Like these guys, I really
like the app.

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:47.790
And I'm actually really
excited to see all the

01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:50.340
changes, all these suggestions
come in.

01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:54.180
If you could go to the next
slide, Marco, the detail view.

01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:57.170
There's one thing here that I
think is worth talking about.

01:10:57.170 --> 01:10:59.610
This is one of my personal,
pet crusades.

01:10:59.610 --> 01:11:02.910
I always talk about this, which
is the sometimes less is

01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:04.380
actually more.

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:09.150
And I have two different types
of wars that I like to wage.

01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:13.000
And one is a war against text
junk, the unnecessary

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.530
typographic elements that are
intended to clarify things,

01:11:17.530 --> 01:11:20.760
but where, actually, space and
contrast and color actually

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:23.210
make a better impact.

01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:26.950
And also label junk, where,
again, context can provide

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:28.910
much of the same function.

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:31.460
So one of the things I'd suggest
you might think about

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:35.080
is, when you look at all those
section headings, they're very

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:37.150
effective as section headings,
because you've used the color

01:11:37.150 --> 01:11:40.070
contrast, so they don't all
need to have that colon

01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:41.370
following them.

01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:44.140
Again, when you have things like
the cost of the app or

01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:47.620
the size or the rating, you
might not even need to have

01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:50.010
labels on many of those things,
because the data

01:11:50.010 --> 01:11:52.600
itself can carry that context.

01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:54.500
You represent the rating
as stars, maybe.

01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:57.010
And then, again, it becomes
very obvious what it is.

01:11:57.010 --> 01:11:59.710
So take a look throughout all
your apps and think about

01:11:59.710 --> 01:12:03.220
which elements are really
just gilding the lily.

01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:05.850
You'll find that taking them out
allows you to really focus

01:12:05.850 --> 01:12:06.495
more on the content.

01:12:06.495 --> 01:12:07.740
MIKE WOLFSON: That's
a really good idea.

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:10.340
That will allow me to recapture
some of that space,

01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:12.830
also, that is so valuable.

01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:14.440
That's a really great
feedback.

01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:15.984
MALE SPEAKER: Sorry to crash,
but that was just one of my

01:12:15.984 --> 01:12:16.530
pet things.

01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:17.520
RICHARD FULCHER: OK, I'm going
to let you finish.

01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:20.911
MARCO PAGLIA: And with that,
I'm honored to--

01:12:20.911 --> 01:12:22.675
[GONG SOUNDS]

01:12:22.675 --> 01:12:23.670
MARCO PAGLIA: Thank you.

01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:24.350
Thank you, Mike.

01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:25.390
RICHARD FULCHER: Yeah,
thank you, Mike.

01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:25.920
MIKE WOLFSON: Thank you.

01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:35.162
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:35.162 --> 01:12:37.250
MARCO PAGLIA: All right.

01:12:37.250 --> 01:12:45.110
The second application we're
going to see today is Papyrus.

01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:48.450
And I'm happy to welcome up
on stage, Andrew Hughes.

01:12:48.450 --> 01:13:06.018
[APPLAUSE]

01:13:06.018 --> 01:13:08.550
ANDREW HUGHES: My voice
isn't that loud.

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:11.620
So this is Papyrus.

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:15.690
It is a natural handwriting
note-taking application.

01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:19.160
I designed it initially
for 10-inch tablets.

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:22.860
And we're slowly trying to work
the interface down to

01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:24.550
smaller devices.

01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:29.230
So this is running on
a ThinkPad tablet.

01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:34.230
How many people know what active
pen technology is?

01:13:34.230 --> 01:13:34.970
A few people.

01:13:34.970 --> 01:13:35.640
OK.

01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:40.410
So natural handwriting is--

01:13:40.410 --> 01:13:42.690
basically, this app allows you
to write just like you would

01:13:42.690 --> 01:13:46.330
write on paper, but with all
of the advantages of modern

01:13:46.330 --> 01:13:47.890
technology, like in tablets.

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:49.780
So with an active pen--

01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:57.250
thank you-- that comes with this
device, it's different

01:13:57.250 --> 01:14:00.370
than a capacitive stylus that
works on just any tablet.

01:14:00.370 --> 01:14:02.170
It's a lot more accurate.

01:14:02.170 --> 01:14:04.420
And it has a lot more
data throughput.

01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:07.260
It can detect when it's near
the device, pressure

01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:09.150
sensitive, it has
side buttons.

01:14:09.150 --> 01:14:10.840
Others have more side buttons.

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:16.870
So for example, if I open a
note here, I can write.

01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:18.250
And it works really
well with me.

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:23.900
So if I have it bigger, you
can see the pressure

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:24.600
sensitivity there.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:28.520
So it allows for a much more
natural handwriting.

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:32.550
So basically, the application
has notebooks on the left and

01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:33.440
notes on the right.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:37.125
And that's about it.

01:14:37.125 --> 01:14:38.462
[GONG SOUNGS]

01:14:38.462 --> 01:14:46.724
[APPLAUSE]

01:14:46.724 --> 01:14:51.230
MARCO PAGLIA: All right,
thank you, Andrew.

01:14:51.230 --> 01:14:51.870
Let's see.

01:14:51.870 --> 01:14:55.840
So when you wrote to us, you
were asking us about the

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.550
general navigation.

01:14:57.550 --> 01:15:00.530
It feels like having to have
this navigation with a

01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:02.120
split-screen, it's kind of

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:05.210
challenging on smaller devices.

01:15:05.210 --> 01:15:07.000
And I thought it was a very
interesting point.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:11.690
In fact, actually, also I was
excited when you applied for

01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:14.290
this workshop, because I do
use this application.

01:15:14.290 --> 01:15:16.700
And the beauty of this
application is that it's all

01:15:16.700 --> 01:15:18.600
about gestures.

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:20.510
You have two fingers.

01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:22.230
You move your canvas
with two fingers.

01:15:22.230 --> 01:15:23.530
You pinch the zoom.

01:15:23.530 --> 01:15:25.810
You control with your pen.

01:15:25.810 --> 01:15:28.280
You can erase with
your finger.

01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:29.860
It's just beautiful.

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:36.340
And then I felt, maybe, a way
to get this kind of screen,

01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:39.420
the split-screen, to work on
different devices, on smaller

01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:42.640
screens could be to maybe having
it slide like a lot of

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.330
applications do today.

01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:46.620
But then, at the same time,
I wonder whether

01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:48.260
there are other options.

01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:50.880
Like maybe you don't need
the split-screen at all.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.400
Why don't we make
the navigation

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.050
to be purely gestural.

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:58.160
So that, when I get
my application,

01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.500
I see all my notebooks.

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:00.600
And then I tap on them.

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:03.260
And they open up in all
the pages that I have.

01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:06.180
And perhaps I can pinch to
get back to my notebooks.

01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:09.210
And everything just becomes
super gestural.

01:16:09.210 --> 01:16:13.740
So that's something that I think
we need to consider.

01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:16.740
Not every application must have
a split-screen or this

01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:17.720
standard navigation.

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:20.580
I think we can really innovate
in the way we get into

01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:22.730
different views.

01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:26.460
I guess the pattern that we
already have, which is similar

01:16:26.460 --> 01:16:28.570
to what I'm talking about,
this gallery, where the

01:16:28.570 --> 01:16:30.610
navigation is purely
hierarchical, you don't have

01:16:30.610 --> 01:16:32.460
any split-screen.

01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:34.951
Tell me what you think
about that.

01:16:34.951 --> 01:16:38.090
ANDREW HUGHES: Yeah,
I want to utilize

01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:40.180
gestures as much as possible.

01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:43.390
So with a pen right now--

01:16:43.390 --> 01:16:46.000
I know you were talking about
the general layout of the

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:54.050
app-- but in the note taking,
you can use gestures to undo.

01:16:54.050 --> 01:16:56.510
So if I draw something and I
flick left to undo and then

01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:59.550
flick right as redo, flick up
to get to the color palette.

01:16:59.550 --> 01:17:02.020
So things like that allow
for quick navigation.

01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:04.355
You can also access those things
just by clicking from

01:17:04.355 --> 01:17:05.740
the action bar.

01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:09.120
But definitely adding more
gestures to be able to

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:11.940
navigate around the rest
of the app as well.

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:13.740
I was talking to Roman Nurik.

01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:16.670
And he suggested, instead of
having buttons to switch

01:17:16.670 --> 01:17:20.780
between pages like that, to use
a bezel swipe to switch

01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:23.000
between pages in the note, which
I think is a great idea.

01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.070
MARCO PAGLIA: That's great,
because I swear I haven't

01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:25.790
talked to Roman.

01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:29.290
But that was part of my
next suggestions.

01:17:29.290 --> 01:17:30.445
ANDREW HUGHES: [LAUGHS]

01:17:30.445 --> 01:17:31.910
MARCO PAGLIA: I swear.

01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:34.460
Maybe we just think
the same way.

01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:36.010
There was another point you
were bringing in you

01:17:36.010 --> 01:17:39.770
application, which is all
of these elements

01:17:39.770 --> 01:17:41.280
on the action bar.

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:42.920
And obviously, when
you get to smaller

01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:44.620
screens, they get stacked.

01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:48.460
So I should have a screen shot
somewhere about that.

01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:50.220
And then you tend to cover
the bottom action

01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:51.360
bar with your hand.

01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:54.010
And things don't
get so usable.

01:17:54.010 --> 01:17:56.530
So maybe even here, just like
Roman was suggesting, an

01:17:56.530 --> 01:17:59.490
option can be do we really need
all those actions on the

01:17:59.490 --> 01:18:00.310
action bar?

01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:01.450
Again, how we can
bring gestures.

01:18:01.450 --> 01:18:03.130
How can we innovate
with gestures?

01:18:03.130 --> 01:18:05.700
I think the reason why we
selected the Papyrus

01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:08.080
application here is really
because innovating with

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.910
gestures is one of the things
that Android, I believe, is

01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:12.610
doing the best.

01:18:12.610 --> 01:18:14.110
We have swiping gestures.

01:18:14.110 --> 01:18:16.160
We have edge gestures.

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.970
We have a lot of things that
we're introducing.

01:18:17.970 --> 01:18:22.520
And I think Papyrus can really
help to push the agenda here.

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:26.310
So one thing is what Roman
was mentioning.

01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:29.750
So maybe add gestures to swipe
from one page to another, just

01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:34.530
like Chrome introduced,
the Chrome browser.

01:18:34.530 --> 01:18:38.110
And then, when I see the Undo
buttons, I'm thinking, I wish

01:18:38.110 --> 01:18:40.750
there was a universal
way to do Undo.

01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:41.970
We just haven't found it yet.

01:18:41.970 --> 01:18:45.870
But I'm sure that, with your
contribution, with your ideas,

01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:50.310
with more applications finding
out the right gesture for

01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:52.300
those patterns, we're going
to crack it at some point.

01:18:52.300 --> 01:18:54.690
And at that point, we
won't need buttons

01:18:54.690 --> 01:18:56.290
any more for Undo.

01:18:56.290 --> 01:18:59.320
I really see how Papyrus, at
some point, will be just,

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:03.660
literally, a piece of paper that
you can navigate with.

01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:05.990
So I don't know if other people
have some feelings

01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:08.015
around the action bar
and these buttons.

01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:15.240
The crowd has been silent
in the last few minutes.

01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:17.740
if you guys want to ask
questions to Andrew, just feel

01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:19.960
free to stand up and come on.

01:19:24.244 --> 01:19:29.920
ANDREW HUGHES: So on the
previous slide, we've had a

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:32.440
lot of users complain
about having the

01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:33.620
buttons on the bottom.

01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:35.600
I put them there because
I didn't really know

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:36.570
what else to do.

01:19:36.570 --> 01:19:40.230
They wouldn't fit in the top,
so I put them on the bottom.

01:19:40.230 --> 01:19:42.350
But when you're writing,
especially, it's kind of

01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:44.320
harder with a Galaxy note,
because it's not

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:45.540
that big of a device.

01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:48.480
But when you're writing,
your hand hits those.

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:52.160
And the other problem is the
physical capacitive buttons

01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:53.240
that are already
on the device.

01:19:53.240 --> 01:19:55.200
People who are left-handed
hit the Back button.

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:59.950
People who are right-handed
hit the Menu button.

01:19:59.950 --> 01:20:03.620
And there's not really a good
way to get around that.

01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:04.460
MARCO PAGLIA: Well, it's
kind of what we

01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:05.780
discussed here, right.

01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:10.300
If you can avoid having,
exposed, the two arrows to go

01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:11.526
from one page to another,
that's going

01:20:11.526 --> 01:20:13.090
to reduce your elements.

01:20:13.090 --> 01:20:15.810
Of course, you probably still
want to give that navigation

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:17.740
in a more findable way.

01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:19.710
Maybe you can have it in
the overflow menu.

01:20:19.710 --> 01:20:23.750
But I think there are ways for
you to probably end up having

01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:26.130
maybe half of these actions.

01:20:26.130 --> 01:20:27.540
RICH FULCHER: We also have--

01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:29.240
You might be able to take a
cue from what some of the

01:20:29.240 --> 01:20:30.480
media apps do.

01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:33.940
Where, once you're in a hangout,
once you're watching

01:20:33.940 --> 01:20:36.270
a video, we actually dismiss
the action bar.

01:20:36.270 --> 01:20:38.050
Now for you, it might just
be a different queue

01:20:38.050 --> 01:20:38.870
that you would use.

01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:41.280
Maybe it's when Stylus
is down.

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:44.680
Just take the bars away, and
maybe wait for that lift off.

01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:45.740
Then they can come back on.

01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:49.510
Because you're never going to
need to activate any of them

01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:52.170
while you're actually in the
sketching mode to output.

01:20:52.170 --> 01:20:56.190
So maybe a trick like that
might be valuable, too.

01:20:56.190 --> 01:20:59.610
MARCO PAGLIA: And there's one
more thing that I wanted to

01:20:59.610 --> 01:21:03.780
talk to you about, which is this
other problem that you

01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:06.530
were facing, the color picker.

01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:10.590
And the problem is, when you
get to a small screen, this

01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:13.940
color picker doesn't seem
to work anymore.

01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:15.300
Now there are ways to do it.

01:21:15.300 --> 01:21:18.520
For instance, in the book
application, what we do, in

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:22.490
smaller screen we do put a tab,
a swipeable tab, to go

01:21:22.490 --> 01:21:23.720
from one arrow to another.

01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:26.470
So you could see that
happening here.

01:21:26.470 --> 01:21:29.630
But even there, I think you can
push the agenda and really

01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:31.840
try something new.

01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:35.950
The color pickers, they were
designed for mice and for

01:21:35.950 --> 01:21:37.665
different kinds of
interaction.

01:21:37.665 --> 01:21:40.465
So I don't know the right
interaction is.

01:21:40.465 --> 01:21:42.930
After I saw that, I started
thinking about it.

01:21:42.930 --> 01:21:46.302
And I'm not sure if I can draw
on this directly, I can try.

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:52.180
So it works beautifully.

01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:55.940
So maybe, you have
this icon here.

01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:59.020
And when you tap it, instead of
getting to a grid like this

01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:02.450
one, maybe you just have
the main colors.

01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:06.530
Like, if it were flowers
and you have all the

01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:08.670
tones around them.

01:22:08.670 --> 01:22:10.800
And then, maybe when you hold
press on them, perhaps you

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:14.560
could zoom in a square, and then
moving your finger left

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:17.190
and right will change that
ratio and intensity.

01:22:17.190 --> 01:22:20.480
The point really is, sometimes
it's not really about putting

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:23.640
the right action bar, or putting
in the right tabs.

01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:26.130
It's really about rethinking
the problem.

01:22:26.130 --> 01:22:28.040
And when we do it, I think
we really could--

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:31.080
when we can crack the problem
with different solutions, I

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:32.840
think we really contribute
to the system to

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:35.570
evolve and to be better.

01:22:35.570 --> 01:22:39.430
So my recommendation would be,
can we find a beautiful way to

01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:43.620
have a color picker, which is
also gestural, uses the

01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:48.660
capacity of a touch screen,
and so forth?

01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:52.870
One question and I think we
have to play the gong.

01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:54.640
AUDIENCE: Because you were
talking about the

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:57.340
undo gesture earlier.

01:22:57.340 --> 01:22:59.660
On a lot of your computers,
you're starting to switch to

01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:03.770
having purely gesture-based
trackpads.

01:23:03.770 --> 01:23:07.120
And often, two fingers swiping
to the left would be going

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.970
back, or vice versa,
to the right.

01:23:09.970 --> 01:23:12.006
And so maybe you could do
something like that.

01:23:12.006 --> 01:23:14.980
And maybe even for changing
pages, you could do, like,

01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:16.680
three fingers.

01:23:16.680 --> 01:23:19.210
So I don't know if that helps.

01:23:19.210 --> 01:23:21.560
ANDREW HUGHES: Yeah, currently
in Papyrus, we use two fingers

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:24.180
to scroll and pinch to zoom.

01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:27.930
Because you can use a single
finger to erase.

01:23:27.930 --> 01:23:29.840
And that's because you can
detect the difference between

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:30.610
the pen and the finger.

01:23:30.610 --> 01:23:33.820
But definitely some gesture
like that--

01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:38.040
like I said, you can use the pen
side button, currently, in

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:42.690
our application, to undo and
redo by performing gestures

01:23:42.690 --> 01:23:45.340
that won't work on non-active
pen devices.

01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:51.060
MARCO PAGLIA: It is a very
interesting problem to

01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:52.550
investigate, and I wish
you the best.

01:23:52.550 --> 01:23:52.920
So--

01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:53.510
ANDREW HUGHES: Thank you.

01:23:53.510 --> 01:23:54.666
MARCO PAGLIA: --round of
applause for Papyrus.

01:23:54.666 --> 01:24:01.120
[APPLAUSE]

01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:02.370
MARCO PAGLIA: We didn't
have to play the gong.

01:24:05.900 --> 01:24:12.780
So the next application coming
on stage is Equalizer.

01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:16.152
And I'm happy to welcome, on
stage, Michael Moussa.

01:24:16.152 --> 01:24:31.530
[APPLAUSE]

01:24:31.530 --> 01:24:34.780
MICHAEL MOUSSA: Hi, I'm Michael
Moussa, and this is

01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:36.180
Alex Rocha.

01:24:36.180 --> 01:24:38.820
We are the founders of
Smart Android Apps.

01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:42.720
And the Equalizer app is a
global equalizer app that

01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:45.980
works with any third-party
music player.

01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:48.050
So I'm just going to get
into it and show you

01:24:48.050 --> 01:24:49.850
a typical use case.

01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:52.750
First of all, you would open up
your favorite music player,

01:24:52.750 --> 01:24:53.740
whatever it may be.

01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:56.980
In my case, Google Play Music.

01:24:56.980 --> 01:25:00.200
And you'd play your song.

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:03.930
And from there, you can
then open up our app.

01:25:03.930 --> 01:25:08.060
We have a convenient shortcut
and a notification bar.

01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:13.350
But Google Play Music also has
this nice, open intent--

01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:17.040
well, Android intent, it's
in API framework.

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:19.950
We go sound effects.

01:25:19.950 --> 01:25:24.100
And from there, I can change
with one of the standard

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:27.610
presets, or go to the equalizer
tab, either by

01:25:27.610 --> 01:25:31.620
touching or swiping, and
then changing them by

01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:33.060
hand, just like that.

01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:36.310
And that's pretty much the gist
of how to use the app.

01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:39.450
There are other, more advanced
features as well.

01:25:39.450 --> 01:25:42.675
So from there, I think we
can go to the slides.

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:52.960
[GONG SOUNDS]

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:53.360
JENS NAGLE: So, yeah, guys.

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:56.920
First of all-- and we talked a
little bit before the session

01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:57.940
today started--

01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:00.710
I was really happy that you guys
applied for this session,

01:26:00.710 --> 01:26:04.570
because I got to know your app,
and I already use it.

01:26:04.570 --> 01:26:09.200
And one feature that I find
especially cool is, they

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:13.250
actually use ID3 tags in the
MP3s to automatically switch

01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:14.810
between presets.

01:26:14.810 --> 01:26:17.810
And that actually works quite
well, especially if you're in

01:26:17.810 --> 01:26:20.270
the car and you don't want to
fiddle around with your phone.

01:26:20.270 --> 01:26:24.150
So I really like it
and I use it.

01:26:24.150 --> 01:26:27.070
One thing I wanted to
talk about is--

01:26:27.070 --> 01:26:31.470
and that might affect other
applications, as well, as far

01:26:31.470 --> 01:26:33.150
as I see it in the market--

01:26:33.150 --> 01:26:35.820
is actually the tutorial.

01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:40.450
So everybody can see, this is
actually the extent of the

01:26:40.450 --> 01:26:41.800
first use tutorial.

01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:45.542
It's like one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

01:26:45.542 --> 01:26:48.650
eight screens.

01:26:48.650 --> 01:26:54.300
What prompted you to have that
tutorial at the beginning?

01:26:54.300 --> 01:26:57.780
MICHAEL MOUSSA: Alex did it,
so he can talk about it.

01:26:57.780 --> 01:26:59.090
ALEX ROCHA: Way to
blame me, huh?

01:26:59.090 --> 01:27:05.890
To be honest, we were having a
lot of issues with support.

01:27:05.890 --> 01:27:08.280
One of the things was, a lot of
our users actually thought

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:12.720
that our application was a music
app, a music player.

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.560
And that's not really true.

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:17.090
What our app is there for is to

01:27:17.090 --> 01:27:18.530
complement the music player.

01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:21.310
Again, you use any music player
you want, whether it be

01:27:21.310 --> 01:27:24.500
the standard music player app,
doubleTwist, whatever

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:25.790
the case may be.

01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:28.050
Then you open our app, and then
that's when you start

01:27:28.050 --> 01:27:31.180
applying some of the presets,
equalizer effects,

01:27:31.180 --> 01:27:34.260
virtualizer, bass booster,
you name it.

01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:38.430
We were getting tons and tons
of emails on, hey guys--

01:27:38.430 --> 01:27:41.290
well, emails and one stars.

01:27:41.290 --> 01:27:43.590
So we actually said, we're
going to come up

01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:45.530
with a guided tour.

01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:49.070
It's going to be, hopefully,
enough so that users can

01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:53.590
actually learn how to use our
app properly, reduce the

01:27:53.590 --> 01:27:55.990
number of support emails we were
getting, and hopefully

01:27:55.990 --> 01:27:59.060
get those ratings
up and going.

01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:01.280
That was, primarily, the
reason why we did it.

01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:03.520
JENS NAGLE: And I can see how
that is sort of a difficult

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:04.810
balance to strike.

01:28:04.810 --> 01:28:09.810
So especially, you have a little
bit of a more techy

01:28:09.810 --> 01:28:14.200
app, in that it's not the
sort of traditional app.

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:20.440
It's sort of a helper app for
other music applications.

01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:21.950
So there's probably
a little bit more

01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:26.030
explanation necessary there.

01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:30.800
But as I said, it's a difficult
balance to strike.

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:34.960
If you get too lengthy, though,
I think you run the

01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:37.520
real risk that you're really
not achieving what you're

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:39.510
setting out to do here.

01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:46.120
Because users are often not
very patient people.

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:49.400
I would venture to say that,
after the second or the third

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:51.020
screen, you would probably
have the

01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:52.940
yada, yada, yada, yada.

01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:55.620
And then, on the
final screen--

01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:59.770
they just skip over content.

01:28:59.770 --> 01:29:02.540
More general, and not
necessarily geared towards

01:29:02.540 --> 01:29:06.690
your app, because I think you
can possibly benefit from th

01:29:06.690 --> 01:29:10.980
tutorial, but I see many apps
on market where, sometimes I

01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:12.610
ask myself, do they really
need a tutorial.

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:21.090
Either the UI is already so
self-explanatory that maybe

01:29:21.090 --> 01:29:22.370
the tutorial is not needed.

01:29:22.370 --> 01:29:26.490
And that is what I would
probably give as advice in

01:29:26.490 --> 01:29:30.890
general, is try to make it
work without a tutorial.

01:29:30.890 --> 01:29:32.660
Try to test it with users.

01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:36.650
Do they really need a tutorial
or does your UI cover it?

01:29:36.650 --> 01:29:41.230
Does the UI speak for
itself, basically.

01:29:41.230 --> 01:29:45.350
The other good outcome of such a
test is that, if you do find

01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:47.440
out that they have problems,
you find out which

01:29:47.440 --> 01:29:48.640
problems they are.

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:52.960
And that is probably something
that you could zero in on.

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:54.970
Cherry pick the problems.

01:29:54.970 --> 01:29:58.350
What are really the problems
that you need to address, or

01:29:58.350 --> 01:30:01.770
the information that you need to
give to users, in order to

01:30:01.770 --> 01:30:06.220
get over to the initial hump To
Understand what your app is

01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:10.590
about and how it interplays
with other apps?

01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:11.450
MICHAEL MOUSSA: What
are your thoughts

01:30:11.450 --> 01:30:12.460
on, like, Toast hints?

01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:16.780
I've seen certain apps, in
certain areas, put Toast hint.

01:30:16.780 --> 01:30:19.320
Maybe the first time, or after
they detect that you're doing

01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:23.880
something which they may feel
wrong a couple times, like the

01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:25.490
swipe app, for instance.

01:30:25.490 --> 01:30:26.740
They use a lot of Toast hints.

01:30:30.170 --> 01:30:34.660
JENS NAGLE: Personally, not
a big fan of Toast.

01:30:34.660 --> 01:30:38.910
What do you guys think, Marco?

01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:40.160
MARCO PAGLIA: You're putting
me on the spot.

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:47.200
I think, like for everything,
any information that we can

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:50.820
avoid to provide and it's just
implicit in what you're doing,

01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:53.160
the better.

01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:56.900
I can see Toast being overused,
just when the UI's

01:30:56.900 --> 01:31:00.090
not confident that it's going
to do a good job.

01:31:00.090 --> 01:31:02.790
And it feels the same with
tutorials, as well.

01:31:02.790 --> 01:31:05.270
You do them because you don't
know if, really, people are

01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:06.540
going to get it.

01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:10.710
It's kind of philosophical, but
obviously the less you use

01:31:10.710 --> 01:31:13.960
Toast, the less you use
tutorial, the more, probably,

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:17.490
you're going to be putting a lot
of emphasis in the UI, in

01:31:17.490 --> 01:31:20.210
the application, and making all
the things clear through

01:31:20.210 --> 01:31:23.930
hierarchies, and through
use cases and so forth.

01:31:23.930 --> 01:31:27.290
So it is a tough call.

01:31:27.290 --> 01:31:30.700
RACHEL GARB: Yeah, and another
thing is that, remember that

01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:34.210
these first time tutorials in
Toast and stuff, they're

01:31:34.210 --> 01:31:35.820
actually interruptions, right.

01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:38.480
It's not something that
the user asked for.

01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:40.620
And chances are, because
of that, they might

01:31:40.620 --> 01:31:41.780
not even pay attention.

01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:43.910
And so they might see it as
an annoyance, quickly

01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:45.390
dismiss it, move on.

01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:47.760
And so the goal that you've set
out, you had really good

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:51.140
intentions, but it didn't
get accomplished.

01:31:51.140 --> 01:31:56.610
One thing is that we are
working on help best

01:31:56.610 --> 01:31:58.790
practices, or patterns
for that.

01:31:58.790 --> 01:32:03.560
And you know that in the action
overflow, help is

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:07.470
something that we recommend be
put there, at the bottom.

01:32:07.470 --> 01:32:10.200
And as that becomes more and
more common, I think users

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:14.350
will look for that, actively,
when they need help.

01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:15.330
MICHAEL MOUSSA: That
makes sense.

01:32:15.330 --> 01:32:17.280
We actually do have
it over there.

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:18.960
If you click on the overflow
menu, you have a

01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:21.220
little help in there.

01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:26.410
We just figured, first thing
they'll do, they'll probably

01:32:26.410 --> 01:32:28.950
run into that issue that I was
saying, where they don't

01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:32.570
properly know how to operate
the application.

01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:37.460
And because of that, then we
decided alright, well let's

01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:41.480
pop it, and then let's also
allow them the option to,

01:32:41.480 --> 01:32:43.420
anytime they want, they can go
back through it, through the

01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:44.910
overflow menu, and hit help.

01:32:44.910 --> 01:32:47.260
But I do agree with you guys.

01:32:47.260 --> 01:32:50.000
Although it did reduce, a little
bit, the amount of

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:54.360
support that we would get, or
support emails, rather, we've

01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:57.650
also gotten a couple emails
about users saying, hey

01:32:57.650 --> 01:33:01.360
listen, seems like it's a
little too many pages.

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:03.400
And we did have some instances,
I don't know if you

01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:05.840
remember, where there's a little
check box in there we

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:08.360
have and it says don't
show again.

01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:11.170
Check on it, hit continue, next
time they load the app,

01:33:11.170 --> 01:33:12.890
the help screen won't show up.

01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:15.330
A lot of people actually didn't
see the check box, even

01:33:15.330 --> 01:33:16.580
though it's right there.

01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:18.650
They would hit continue, and
then next time they would open

01:33:18.650 --> 01:33:20.740
the app, the splash beam
would show up.

01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:24.260
So there's definitely
some pros and cons.

01:33:24.260 --> 01:33:27.610
JENS NAGLE: And that was one of
the other pieces of advice

01:33:27.610 --> 01:33:29.310
that I wanted to give.

01:33:29.310 --> 01:33:34.780
Do give people an option to bail
out on the first screen.

01:33:34.780 --> 01:33:40.380
Don't force them to go through
eight pages, but say, OK, I

01:33:40.380 --> 01:33:42.190
feel like I got this
handled, so I'm

01:33:42.190 --> 01:33:43.810
going to skip the tutorial.

01:33:43.810 --> 01:33:47.640
Especially when you have it
covered in the overflow menu

01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:50.440
later on, so you can go
back and revisit it.

01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:52.720
MICHAEL MOUSSA: Maybe we don't
show it on default, and they

01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:55.190
have to access it through
the overflow menu.

01:33:55.190 --> 01:33:56.380
Maybe that's a good way.

01:33:56.380 --> 01:33:58.020
MARCO PAGLIA: And something that
I wanted to say, is that

01:33:58.020 --> 01:33:59.170
you guys would be surprised.

01:33:59.170 --> 01:34:01.710
We do so many user testing
around the out of the box

01:34:01.710 --> 01:34:04.270
experience with an
Android device.

01:34:04.270 --> 01:34:08.190
And you know we have those
screens that shows up once,

01:34:08.190 --> 01:34:10.900
and they tell how to add
something for the home screen,

01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:11.650
and things like that.

01:34:11.650 --> 01:34:14.690
So even though you are excited,
you just got a new

01:34:14.690 --> 01:34:18.720
device, you probably are
more likely to be

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:19.480
reading these things.

01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:21.120
Still, people don't do it.

01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:23.240
People just want to get right
into the experience.

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:25.690
MICHAEL MOUSSA: I don't
do it, either.

01:34:25.690 --> 01:34:27.530
JENS NAGLE: I think
we have some

01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:29.506
questions from the audience.

01:34:29.506 --> 01:34:29.850
AUDIENCE: Hey guys.

01:34:29.850 --> 01:34:32.160
I actually just wanted to
share an experience.

01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:34.030
I'm thinking back to when I was
a kid, and the first time

01:34:34.030 --> 01:34:35.770
I came across an equalizer,
the bass and the treble

01:34:35.770 --> 01:34:37.190
buttons on a stereo.

01:34:37.190 --> 01:34:39.000
It's completely magical, where
all of a sudden, you bump the

01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.650
bass and the whole
house shakes.

01:34:40.650 --> 01:34:41.900
Everything's effected
immediately.

01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:43.500
You didn't have to explain
anything to me, I just had to

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:44.600
turn the knob.

01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:46.940
Later on in life, when I saw a
graphic equalizer, you have

01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:49.196
colors, you have, like, six,
seven, eight colors and knobs

01:34:49.196 --> 01:34:50.770
that you could turn up
and down immediately.

01:34:50.770 --> 01:34:52.640
You don't have to tell me what
it does, all I have to do is

01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:54.460
turn a couple down, and you
can hear it immediately.

01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:56.860
And that's the great thing about
a graphic equalizer.

01:34:56.860 --> 01:34:58.220
The way I see your app, I think
there's probably two

01:34:58.220 --> 01:34:59.520
different types of users.

01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:01.440
One is going to be your
audiophile, the person who

01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:02.710
wants to get in there, and
really tweak, and make their

01:35:02.710 --> 01:35:03.790
performance optimal.

01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:05.820
Another person is just going to
be entertained purely with

01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:08.280
playing with the manipulation
of sound.

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:09.116
I think, maybe, that's
something

01:35:09.116 --> 01:35:10.366
you guys can consider.

01:35:13.130 --> 01:35:18.060
AUDIENCE: It seems to me, if
users are asking for a music

01:35:18.060 --> 01:35:20.690
player, you should just
put a basic music

01:35:20.690 --> 01:35:24.370
player in there by default.

01:35:24.370 --> 01:35:25.350
ALEX ROCHA: That makes sense.

01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:28.210
AUDIENCE: You're going to have
beginners and intermediate

01:35:28.210 --> 01:35:29.910
audiophiles, and then
audiophiles

01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:31.610
will find their tools.

01:35:31.610 --> 01:35:33.670
And then, this way,
there is no--

01:35:33.670 --> 01:35:35.606
by default, they use
your music player.

01:35:35.606 --> 01:35:38.175
And you've done so much work,
already, on this.

01:35:38.175 --> 01:35:41.230
I'm sure it wouldn't be
trouble to, basic--

01:35:41.230 --> 01:35:43.520
MICHAEL MOUSSA: Stay tuned.

01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:44.470
Check out our website.

01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:46.700
Something's coming.

01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:48.110
AUDIENCE: Hello.

01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:50.070
First of all, congratulations
for the app.

01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:54.140
I find it super useful, so
I'll get it, definitely.

01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:57.510
I kind of agree with the
blue shirt girl.

01:36:00.190 --> 01:36:01.100
RACHEL GARB: Thanks.

01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:03.550
AUDIENCE: These kind of
interruptions for the user are

01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:05.300
kind of annoying, especially
the first

01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:07.310
time you get the app.

01:36:07.310 --> 01:36:11.640
So on Toast, of course,
are really ugly.

01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:16.120
One solution that we are using
for our app, for Wunderlist--

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:18.840
you can download it, all
of us, all of you.

01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:19.730
It's a really smart solution.

01:36:19.730 --> 01:36:23.940
What we do is, we kind of make
hints live when you open the

01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:25.880
app for the first time.

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:27.950
So we show the main screen,
and we kind of add some

01:36:27.950 --> 01:36:31.790
graphics around, in the corners,
where more difficult

01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:33.690
places for users are.

01:36:33.690 --> 01:36:35.430
So it's kind of, you're
not blocking the user.

01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:37.430
You have all the functionality
there.

01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:41.053
And you show them, you can plan
the user a tick box, just

01:36:41.053 --> 01:36:42.200
not to show them again.

01:36:42.200 --> 01:36:43.780
ALEX ROCHA: I think I've seen
what you're saying.

01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:47.080
And there's a couple instances
where developers will come up

01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:49.830
with an overlay pop-up
that shows up.

01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:51.270
And then they'll say, all right,
click here, and then

01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:52.630
this will do this and that.

01:36:52.630 --> 01:36:54.540
All they gotta do is click
outside, anywhere on the

01:36:54.540 --> 01:36:56.820
screen, and then the
pop-up dismisses.

01:36:56.820 --> 01:36:58.800
So that might be a
better option.

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:00.240
AUDIENCE: And you're
not, like, killing.

01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:02.372
You're not interrupting.

01:37:02.372 --> 01:37:04.580
MARCO PAGLIA: So I think we're
out of time, but let's talk a

01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:06.782
little bit more after
the show.

01:37:06.782 --> 01:37:07.278
[GONG SOUNDS]

01:37:07.278 --> 01:37:08.270
MARCO PAGLIA: Thank you.

01:37:08.270 --> 01:37:14.230
[APPLAUSE]

01:37:14.230 --> 01:37:17.290
MARCO PAGLIA: So we have
two more apps to go.

01:37:17.290 --> 01:37:19.400
The next one is going
to be Latify.

01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:23.494
And I welcome on stage,
Davy De Waele.

01:37:23.494 --> 01:37:42.140
[APPLAUSE]

01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:42.580
DAVY DE WAELE: Hello, welcome.

01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:43.830
I'm Davy.

01:37:47.726 --> 01:37:50.980
Marco was kind enough to give
me his phone, because mine

01:37:50.980 --> 01:37:57.300
obviously has a wi-fi cell
radio problem here.

01:37:57.300 --> 01:38:04.140
So the application, Latify, is
basically a way to control how

01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:06.430
your location and location
history is

01:38:06.430 --> 01:38:08.260
processed by your phone.

01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:10.460
It's basically a Google Latitude
client that allows

01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:15.620
you to have fine-grained
location updates being managed

01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:17.350
from the application.

01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:21.960
It also allows you to upload
your location to other Google

01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:26.530
services like Fusion Tables,
stuff like that.

01:38:26.530 --> 01:38:29.540
It allows you to share your
location, location history.

01:38:29.540 --> 01:38:31.420
So everything related
to location and

01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:32.865
location history, basically.

01:38:36.506 --> 01:38:40.340
[GONG SOUNDS]

01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:43.900
RACHEL GARB: So Davy, I am blown
away by the amount of

01:38:43.900 --> 01:38:45.590
features you have in the app.

01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:49.260
I mean, this thing, as you said
in the description in the

01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:52.230
Google Play store, this
is a feature-rich app.

01:38:52.230 --> 01:38:56.160
And sometimes, with feature rich
apps, we have challenges

01:38:56.160 --> 01:39:02.240
in terms of how to promote all
that it can do without

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:03.810
overwhelming the user.

01:39:03.810 --> 01:39:08.290
So I guess the question I have
for you is, of all the things

01:39:08.290 --> 01:39:11.930
that this can do, what is
the most important.

01:39:11.930 --> 01:39:13.830
DAVY DE WAELE: Yeah, so like I
said, it's basically kind of a

01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:16.140
geeky, techie application.

01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:21.080
So it's kind of a derived from
a Google Latitude API sample

01:39:21.080 --> 01:39:23.970
that I did, and it kind of
grew to this feature-rich

01:39:23.970 --> 01:39:25.130
application.

01:39:25.130 --> 01:39:27.720
So I think the important aspect
of this application is

01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:33.740
that it allows you to really
fine grain the way that your

01:39:33.740 --> 01:39:37.500
location updates are pushed to
Google Latitude, and Fusion

01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:38.780
Tables, and stuff like that.

01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:41.690
So you can really define
the interval.

01:39:41.690 --> 01:39:44.230
Do you want to use GPS, Wi-Fi?

01:39:44.230 --> 01:39:46.020
What do you want to do if you
don't have an internet

01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:47.000
connection?

01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.990
Should it sync that afterwards,
should it sync it

01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:51.700
automatically, stuff
like that.

01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:54.210
So it's the way that
your location is

01:39:54.210 --> 01:39:55.560
pushed to Google, basically.

01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:56.540
RACHEL GARB: OK.

01:39:56.540 --> 01:39:59.990
With that, I thought we could
take a look, together, at your

01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:01.680
action bar that you have now.

01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:06.570
It's a definite improvement from
the previous version, I

01:40:06.570 --> 01:40:08.290
think, in terms of
iconography.

01:40:08.290 --> 01:40:10.350
You're using some
standard ones.

01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:12.510
MARCO PAGLIA: Actually, for
clarity, what you see here is

01:40:12.510 --> 01:40:15.440
the current application
available on market to the

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:19.780
left, and this one is the
application that he's

01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:21.010
currently building.

01:40:21.010 --> 01:40:23.960
RACHEL GARB: Yeah so right away,
I can tell, ahh, I can

01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:25.690
share, I can refresh.

01:40:25.690 --> 01:40:28.000
There are some familiar
things here.

01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:31.370
And then there are few I wasn't
so sure about, but they

01:40:31.370 --> 01:40:32.760
fit in visually.

01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:35.970
I think Peter can speak to it.

01:40:35.970 --> 01:40:38.490
There are two things that I
wanted to talk about with the

01:40:38.490 --> 01:40:38.870
action bar.

01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:41.730
One is, is there a way
that we could have

01:40:41.730 --> 01:40:43.700
fewer, do you think?

01:40:43.700 --> 01:40:46.580
In terms of importance, are all
these equally important,

01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:48.060
are there things that--

01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:50.020
DAVY DE WAELE: You mean the
action items on the bottom?

01:40:50.020 --> 01:40:53.204
RACHEL GARB: Yeah that's
right, those icons.

01:40:53.204 --> 01:40:53.666
DAVY DE WAELE: Yeah--

01:40:53.666 --> 01:40:56.438
MARCO PAGLIA: They're
all important!

01:40:56.438 --> 01:40:58.420
DAVY DE WAELE: It's always
difficult to, kind of, remove

01:40:58.420 --> 01:41:01.290
stuff, but I'm sure that--

01:41:01.290 --> 01:41:03.640
for me, they're kind of
equally important.

01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:05.990
RACHEL GARB: Well, I'll
give a suggestion.

01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:08.950
One thing is that users are
accustomed, and I think

01:41:08.950 --> 01:41:12.160
they'll be more accustomed, in
the future, to going to the

01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:14.060
overflow menu for help.

01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:16.010
And the one thing that I think
you don't want to do--

01:41:16.010 --> 01:41:19.270
when you put help front and
center like that, it

01:41:19.270 --> 01:41:20.600
kind of sends a--

01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:22.870
what do you call it-- subliminal
message, this thing

01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:24.330
is difficult to use.

01:41:24.330 --> 01:41:28.500
So that's one you
could easily--

01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:32.500
and then you're down to
five, yeah, four.

01:41:32.500 --> 01:41:35.620
PETER ANG: Yeah, and touching
on Rachel's point, a lot of

01:41:35.620 --> 01:41:37.690
times in visual design, there's
just a lot of stuff.

01:41:37.690 --> 01:41:40.970
And you really want to direct
a user's view and focus

01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:42.740
towards one place, which
would be the map

01:41:42.740 --> 01:41:44.330
and your main actions.

01:41:44.330 --> 01:41:47.526
And then you could draw those
icons even flatter and

01:41:47.526 --> 01:41:50.360
flatter, but you can draw them
flatter than how they are

01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:50.630
right now, right.

01:41:50.630 --> 01:41:53.550
And so a lot of the time, visual
design is about picking

01:41:53.550 --> 01:41:56.170
and choosing the important
things, and removing and

01:41:56.170 --> 01:41:59.350
sticking other things, and
stashing them away.

01:41:59.350 --> 01:42:01.490
RACHEL GARB: While you're up
here, Peter, I did want to ask

01:42:01.490 --> 01:42:03.040
you about a particular icon.

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:05.240
So the pin, right?

01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:08.540
So there's a pin icon here,
there's a pin in the middle of

01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:15.080
the map, and there's also a pin
in the Latify launcher.

01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:17.700
PETER ANG: So I think GigBeat
did a really good job with how

01:42:17.700 --> 01:42:19.650
they expressed their brand,
was, they had a

01:42:19.650 --> 01:42:21.440
subtle cue of pink.

01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:24.230
And they had the same shape,
that kind of permeated through

01:42:24.230 --> 01:42:25.010
the whole app, right.

01:42:25.010 --> 01:42:26.360
And then, you could
also do the same.

01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:28.430
Like, the pin is the
hero in this app.

01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:31.550
And then if you really created,
whether it be a pin,

01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:36.010
or that Google shape, place
thing, and then you have that

01:42:36.010 --> 01:42:37.795
consistent everywhere, it's
really recognizable.

01:42:37.795 --> 01:42:40.810
And you could really showcase
that as the hero of your

01:42:40.810 --> 01:42:41.310
application.

01:42:41.310 --> 01:42:43.580
DAVY DE WAELE: I'll check with
the designer that I'm probably

01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:45.290
going to have to hire.

01:42:45.290 --> 01:42:49.570
RACHEL GARB: And speaking of
pin, can you describe for us

01:42:49.570 --> 01:42:50.610
what this does?

01:42:50.610 --> 01:42:51.520
This particular--

01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:53.820
DAVY DE WAELE: Yeah, so
basically what this pin does,

01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:57.560
is that, as it says in the
horrible Toast, it allows you

01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:00.920
to set your location manually,
without using

01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:03.630
the Wi-Fi or GPS.

01:43:03.630 --> 01:43:07.870
So it basically allows you to
tap around the map and allows

01:43:07.870 --> 01:43:10.430
you to set a location
manually.

01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:12.460
RACHEL GARB: So what happens,
let's say that I didn't have

01:43:12.460 --> 01:43:16.260
that manual on, and I were to
touch somewhere on the map.

01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:17.180
What would it do?

01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:18.210
DAVY DE WAELE: Then it
would just be the

01:43:18.210 --> 01:43:20.290
standard map behavior.

01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:25.840
RACHEL GARB: Panel, what do you
think about trying to make

01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:31.290
the manual setting of location
more direct manipulation,

01:43:31.290 --> 01:43:33.930
where you don't have
to touch something.

01:43:33.930 --> 01:43:35.500
DAVY DE WAELE: Like a long
press, or something?

01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:36.400
Or--

01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:38.880
RACHEL GARB: I'm not sure what
the right answer is, but just,

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:41.870
when I think of, if this is
something that people are

01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:44.280
going to do a lot, just
be able to touch.

01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:47.286
And then maybe blow up.

01:43:47.286 --> 01:43:49.280
MARCO PAGLIA: Yeah, it
really feels like--

01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:51.190
I see all the actions here
in the action bar

01:43:51.190 --> 01:43:52.670
at the bottom, right.

01:43:52.670 --> 01:43:55.960
And then, when I tap on the
screen, nothing happens.

01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:58.630
And it really feels like you
should be able to take some of

01:43:58.630 --> 01:44:01.740
these primary actions and put
them on the pin itself.

01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:04.600
It kind of surprises that if I
tap on the pain, I don't get

01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:05.840
an interaction.

01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:08.610
So that's, I think, the message
we want to build.

01:44:08.610 --> 01:44:10.690
Let's put the actions
where they matter.

01:44:10.690 --> 01:44:13.230
Let's just don't be lazy and be
like, OK, there's an action

01:44:13.230 --> 01:44:13.940
bar for that.

01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:14.910
We'll put everything in there.

01:44:14.910 --> 01:44:17.470
Let's try to think about where
they can be in the view.

01:44:17.470 --> 01:44:20.140
Because the more we embed them,
the more we map them

01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:23.595
where they matter, the more
people will find them.

01:44:23.595 --> 01:44:24.990
RACHEL GARB: OK.

01:44:24.990 --> 01:44:26.860
Question from the audience.

01:44:26.860 --> 01:44:28.090
AUDIENCE: About the icons
on the bottom--

01:44:28.090 --> 01:44:29.825
I'm a developer, too, and I
understand all the features

01:44:29.825 --> 01:44:32.380
that we implement are super
important to us.

01:44:32.380 --> 01:44:34.940
But we always roll analytics in,
and see what our users are

01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:36.040
actually using.

01:44:36.040 --> 01:44:40.170
And we can use that data to rank
the different features

01:44:40.170 --> 01:44:42.490
that we have there and maybe not
include them all, back to

01:44:42.490 --> 01:44:43.140
your point.

01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:45.410
So sort them by priority, and
maybe get rid of some of the

01:44:45.410 --> 01:44:47.392
ones that aren't used
terribly often.

01:44:47.392 --> 01:44:49.312
DAVY DE WAELE: That's definitely
a good point, yeah.

01:44:49.312 --> 01:44:51.330
JEREMY LYON: One thing is, be
careful about when you use

01:44:51.330 --> 01:44:52.460
analytics in that way, though.

01:44:52.460 --> 01:44:55.200
Of course, your design is going
to bias people towards

01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:56.750
selecting certain buttons.

01:44:56.750 --> 01:44:59.200
So there is definitely room for
analytics, but I think it

01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:02.220
also requires a lot of thinking
ahead and trying it

01:45:02.220 --> 01:45:04.460
out yourself.

01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:07.420
RACHEL GARB: Switching topics,
can we go to the screen where

01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:08.670
you have the profiles?

01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:13.080
I don't think you were
able to describe it.

01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:17.640
Well actually, why don't
we just stay on here.

01:45:17.640 --> 01:45:18.160
Let's stay here.

01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:20.440
While we're here right now,
another question.

01:45:20.440 --> 01:45:23.430
This goes back to iconography.

01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:25.700
I've noticed that when--

01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:28.810
each of these has an icon, and
when you navigate there, your

01:45:28.810 --> 01:45:32.130
app icon changes.

01:45:32.130 --> 01:45:36.200
And I wondered about that,
because I'm accustomed to

01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:39.310
seeing the app icon persistent
through an app.

01:45:39.310 --> 01:45:42.040
And when I first saw the globes,
I thought, oh, that's

01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:43.290
the browser.

01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:52.440
What are your thoughts about not
having icons at all, for

01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:54.590
the other choices there?

01:45:54.590 --> 01:45:56.610
DAVY DE WAELE: I think the
fact that there are now

01:45:56.610 --> 01:45:58.720
different icons shown,
is because each

01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:01.030
activity has its own icon.

01:46:01.030 --> 01:46:06.980
And the action bar was kind of
using the spinner control,

01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:10.340
which kind of loads up all the
activities here, and this

01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:12.180
behavior kind of came
out of the box.

01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:14.910
But it can be made differently,
of course.

01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:17.300
RACHEL GARB: Yeah, I wonder if
it would take away all that

01:46:17.300 --> 01:46:19.880
much if there were
no icons at all.

01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:24.030
DAVY DE WAELE: Also in this,
over in this spinner control.

01:46:24.030 --> 01:46:26.440
I kind of got this from the
Google Maps application, which

01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:27.630
kind of did it in that way.

01:46:27.630 --> 01:46:28.760
RACHEL GARB: Ahh, I see.

01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:32.870
DAVY DE WAELE: It's exactly
the same pattern.

01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:33.350
RACHEL GARB: OK.

01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:37.720
Well, that's something that we
might question on the maps

01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:38.590
product, too.

01:46:38.590 --> 01:46:42.810
DAVY DE WAELE: You have the
places Also different icons.

01:46:42.810 --> 01:46:45.380
RICHARD FULCHER: Yeah, the older
version of the G+ app

01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:47.420
was similarly guilty of that.

01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:50.160
DAVY DE WAELE: I'm following
your pattern, but you're not

01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:50.760
playing with that.

01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:51.885
RICHARD FULCHER: Bless
your heart.

01:46:51.885 --> 01:46:57.490
[APPLAUSE]

01:46:57.490 --> 01:47:00.460
DAVY DE WAELE: But I was
thinking about placing this

01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:05.950
with the kind of slide-in
thing from Google+ now?

01:47:05.950 --> 01:47:09.010
RICHARD FULCHER: Yeah, so I
think that pattern would be a

01:47:09.010 --> 01:47:10.820
really good match for
this context, right?

01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:13.700
Because they tend to be
exclusive modes that you would

01:47:13.700 --> 01:47:16.190
be in within the application.

01:47:16.190 --> 01:47:18.430
And just kind of bringing in
that panel instead of the

01:47:18.430 --> 01:47:21.990
drop-down, especially if you
want to cosmetically add the

01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:25.240
icons to add differentiation
between the different ones.

01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:27.900
You wouldn't necessarily even
have to carry those individual

01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:30.220
icons forward from that point,
but to just kind of make

01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:33.370
identification easier is a
reasonable way to go, I think.

01:47:33.370 --> 01:47:36.170
DAVY DE WAELE: It also allows
you to put more stuff in it,

01:47:36.170 --> 01:47:40.320
like notification stuff.

01:47:40.320 --> 01:47:42.650
RICHARD FULCHER: Yeah, I mean,
for this app I could imagine

01:47:42.650 --> 01:47:45.780
you could have a packet which
was explaining the current

01:47:45.780 --> 01:47:47.650
state of what you were
broadcasting.

01:47:47.650 --> 01:47:51.200
Like in addition to, here is the
stuff I can navigate to,

01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:53.780
here's the current state of what
I'm transmitting as far

01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:56.000
as my location goes
to latitude.

01:47:56.000 --> 01:47:58.145
MARCO PAGLIA: There's something
here, though, I

01:47:58.145 --> 01:48:01.480
think should be important to
reference which is preferences

01:48:01.480 --> 01:48:04.630
and health are not
really much--

01:48:04.630 --> 01:48:06.690
normally you use this pattern
when you have different

01:48:06.690 --> 01:48:08.290
applications within
an application.

01:48:08.290 --> 01:48:09.550
It's a lot of features.

01:48:09.550 --> 01:48:11.730
But the preference is in
Help for the settings.

01:48:11.730 --> 01:48:13.120
They normally go under
an overflow.

01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:15.145
This is how people are
trained to find it.

01:48:15.145 --> 01:48:17.910
And especially because if they
go under an overflow, they can

01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:20.322
find it in different screens,
and not just in the main

01:48:20.322 --> 01:48:22.180
screen where you have it.

01:48:22.180 --> 01:48:25.120
There's just a little detail.

01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:26.980
RACHEL GARB: Do we have time for
one more question, or were

01:48:26.980 --> 01:48:27.920
you about to gong?

01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:28.330
RICHARD FULCHER: No, no, no.

01:48:28.330 --> 01:48:28.590
Go ahead.

01:48:28.590 --> 01:48:29.060
One more.

01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:29.200
RACHEL GARB: OK.

01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:31.740
Why don't we take one more
question from the audience?

01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:37.690
AUDIENCE: So looking at the
pin, when you press it,

01:48:37.690 --> 01:48:42.070
there's no real sort of context
change for the user.

01:48:42.070 --> 01:48:44.380
I was wondering whether you
should do something similar to

01:48:44.380 --> 01:48:48.300
in the list screens, where the
header then sort of changes,

01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:51.316
and it goes a sort of darker
blue in ICS, whether something

01:48:51.316 --> 01:48:53.280
like that would kind of help
the user know what mode

01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:55.390
they're in.

01:48:55.390 --> 01:48:57.160
DAVY DE WAELE: You mean like if
you press on a pin and you

01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:58.700
change like the action bar?

01:48:58.700 --> 01:49:00.460
AUDIENCE: Well if you press
in the pin on the

01:49:00.460 --> 01:49:02.000
action bar now, yeah.

01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:06.100
If there's no indication
that you're--?

01:49:06.100 --> 01:49:06.280
DAVY DE WAELE: Yeah.

01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:08.645
That can also be, yeah.

01:49:08.645 --> 01:49:10.680
RACHEL GARB: Yeah, in different
icon states.

01:49:10.680 --> 01:49:13.310
Do we have time for one more
topic within Latify?

01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:14.140
OK.

01:49:14.140 --> 01:49:15.390
Profiles page.

01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:22.160
When I saw this, what jumped out
to me immediately, and I

01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:24.310
also work on it a lot,
is settings and

01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:26.680
the settings pattern.

01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:29.180
These look like settings to
me, although you've called

01:49:29.180 --> 01:49:31.240
them profiles.

01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:33.920
Do you think a lot of people
will use them often and change

01:49:33.920 --> 01:49:35.890
them often, or will they
set it and forget it?

01:49:35.890 --> 01:49:36.490
They will?

01:49:36.490 --> 01:49:38.280
DAVY DE WAELE: Yeah, this is
kind of the part which is

01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:42.650
primarily used, because people
like put it in driving mode

01:49:42.650 --> 01:49:45.370
because they want to update
their location every 30

01:49:45.370 --> 01:49:49.050
seconds and get a really nice
trail of their trip.

01:49:49.050 --> 01:49:50.150
RACHEL GARB: And then
when they're done,

01:49:50.150 --> 01:49:50.330
they turn it off.

01:49:50.330 --> 01:49:52.220
DAVY DE WAELE: When they're
at home, they put it in 10

01:49:52.220 --> 01:49:56.340
minutes, 30 minutes, to see that
OK, I was at home for 8

01:49:56.340 --> 01:49:59.060
hours, or I was at work
for 10 hours.

01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:01.920
RACHEL GARB: But will they
come here a lot to change

01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:05.100
these choices, or will they--

01:50:05.100 --> 01:50:05.910
DAVY DE WAELE: Usually
it's done like once.

01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:09.160
They basically set it up, and
then there's either a widget

01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:14.010
to quickly change profile, or
there is integration with

01:50:14.010 --> 01:50:17.530
applications like Task or
Lookout to automatically

01:50:17.530 --> 01:50:19.790
switch them based on
certain conditions.

01:50:19.790 --> 01:50:22.210
RACHEL GARB: So I would suggest
that if it's true that

01:50:22.210 --> 01:50:25.690
these are not changed a lot,
these preferences, that you

01:50:25.690 --> 01:50:28.310
merge them with settings, that
you merge them with your

01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:30.500
preferences and have
a setting section

01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:31.570
in your action overflow.

01:50:31.570 --> 01:50:34.530
Because that's reserved for
things that aren't used a lot,

01:50:34.530 --> 01:50:40.080
and that will also help in terms
of reducing the number

01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:41.890
of choices on your
main screen.

01:50:41.890 --> 01:50:46.630
Now, in terms of design of the
profiles, definitely take a

01:50:46.630 --> 01:50:50.290
look at the settings pattern
in the design guide.

01:50:50.290 --> 01:50:54.410
We've got patterns that exist
for all of these so that you

01:50:54.410 --> 01:50:58.270
don't have to use big buttons.

01:50:58.270 --> 01:51:01.370
In terms of these question
marks, it's interesting that

01:51:01.370 --> 01:51:04.880
help's come up a few times
now in the session,

01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:06.600
which I think is great.

01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:11.170
So you have help choices for
every single setting, and

01:51:11.170 --> 01:51:11.990
there are--

01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:13.780
let's see, there's
seven of them.

01:51:13.780 --> 01:51:18.830
And they're big and they're
blue, and I'm wondering, what

01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:20.830
if they weren't there?

01:51:20.830 --> 01:51:25.578
Could there be another way that
you could provide help?

01:51:25.578 --> 01:51:27.450
DAVY DE WAELE: She's tough!

01:51:27.450 --> 01:51:28.760
RICHARD FULCHER: The girl
in blue is subtle.

01:51:31.640 --> 01:51:34.200
DAVY DE WAELE: I tried to put
all this text into this

01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:35.783
screen, but it's not possible.

01:51:35.783 --> 01:51:37.600
I don't know.

01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:40.530
RACHEL GARB: Again, like the
point I made earlier, when you

01:51:40.530 --> 01:51:42.580
have a question mark that's
given a lot of prominence, it

01:51:42.580 --> 01:51:45.370
says to somebody, it kind
of sends that subliminal

01:51:45.370 --> 01:51:47.210
message-- this is scary.

01:51:47.210 --> 01:51:49.030
And now you have
seven of them.

01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:53.070
DAVY DE WAELE: It is kind of
scary, because there are a lot

01:51:53.070 --> 01:51:53.770
of settings.

01:51:53.770 --> 01:51:56.760
And I think it's specific to
this type of application,

01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:59.550
because I really want to
give the user this

01:51:59.550 --> 01:52:01.290
fine-grained control.

01:52:01.290 --> 01:52:04.960
And with that fine-grained
control comes a little bit of

01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:08.720
additional information that
they might need, I think.

01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:12.860
RACHEL GARB: So my suggestion
would be, explore how these

01:52:12.860 --> 01:52:16.060
labels could be as informative
as possible without getting

01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:17.010
very wordy.

01:52:17.010 --> 01:52:20.660
I know that can be
tough to do.

01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:23.510
And maybe your dialogues,
as well.

01:52:23.510 --> 01:52:25.560
RICHARD FULCHER: And you don't
have to feel constrained,

01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:27.860
necessarily, to equal
height list items.

01:52:27.860 --> 01:52:31.650
You could have a three- or
four-line block of text under

01:52:31.650 --> 01:52:34.380
each item if it would really be
helpful to explain in this

01:52:34.380 --> 01:52:35.900
context, and just take
the touch away.

01:52:35.900 --> 01:52:37.580
So to provide the same
content, but just

01:52:37.580 --> 01:52:38.910
make it more immediate.

01:52:38.910 --> 01:52:43.970
RACHEL GARB: Or if you think
that all of this explanation

01:52:43.970 --> 01:52:46.230
might be useful to see all
together at once, like these

01:52:46.230 --> 01:52:49.410
choices relate to another,
consider having one help

01:52:49.410 --> 01:52:54.070
choice for the entire screen in
the action or [INAUDIBLE].

01:52:54.070 --> 01:52:55.760
OK.

01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:56.990
One more question and then--

01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:58.340
MARCO PAGLIA: One more question,
then we get to--

01:52:58.340 --> 01:53:01.485
AUDIENCE: Another way that we
could do the Help on that is

01:53:01.485 --> 01:53:06.230
simply provide, on the label,
a link to the same Help, so

01:53:06.230 --> 01:53:09.350
that if you tapped on Location
Polling Interval, on that

01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:12.440
text, it would bring up
that information.

01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:17.010
And that way you could remove a
control entirely, and you've

01:53:17.010 --> 01:53:21.710
still got affordance for
the full information.

01:53:21.710 --> 01:53:25.710
And then, if you also added a
subtext in there, you could

01:53:25.710 --> 01:53:27.490
provide a little bit of help,
and then if somebody touched

01:53:27.490 --> 01:53:29.346
it you could provide
the whole help.

01:53:29.346 --> 01:53:30.330
MARCO PAGLIA: Yeah,
I was thinking

01:53:30.330 --> 01:53:31.370
about something similar.

01:53:31.370 --> 01:53:32.490
It's a very good insight.

01:53:32.490 --> 01:53:35.120
And I think it talks about,
again, this message we're

01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:37.510
trying to deliver, which is, try
to have the actions where

01:53:37.510 --> 01:53:39.170
they matter, rather
than creating

01:53:39.170 --> 01:53:43.440
them outside the view.

01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:46.340
And with that, thank you
very much, Davy.

01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:48.113
RACHEL GARB: Yeah,
thanks, Davy.

01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:56.020
MARCO PAGLIA: So this is the
last application, and I invite

01:53:56.020 --> 01:53:57.270
you all to stay.

01:54:04.510 --> 01:54:07.720
Because it's going to
be a lot of fun.

01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:13.010
As soon as we got this
application as a volunteer, we

01:54:13.010 --> 01:54:15.140
were like, oh, yeah, we
need to do it, because

01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:16.080
it's so much fun.

01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:17.160
And we played with it.

01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:21.610
So I'm really happy to have
Oren onstage with us

01:54:21.610 --> 01:54:22.890
presenting Face Blender.

01:54:31.710 --> 01:54:33.096
OREN BENGIGI: OK.

01:54:33.096 --> 01:54:34.030
Hi, everyone.

01:54:34.030 --> 01:54:35.770
My name is Oren Bengigi.

01:54:35.770 --> 01:54:39.620
I've been developing for
about two years ago.

01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:43.220
My previous experience was
doing image processing.

01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:47.210
And Face Blender is an app that
was set to solve a very

01:54:47.210 --> 01:54:50.630
important problem of taking
two different faces and

01:54:50.630 --> 01:54:55.030
blending them into one face.

01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:58.445
So if you want to see how you
and your girlfriend's children

01:54:58.445 --> 01:55:00.865
will look like, you
can use this app.

01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:04.900
This is the UI.

01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:09.680
You can go to the Blend Face
UI, and from here, you can

01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:11.780
open up the camera.

01:55:11.780 --> 01:55:13.750
Maybe we do a live demo.

01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:15.030
Anyone want to--

01:55:15.030 --> 01:55:16.242
OK.

01:55:16.242 --> 01:55:17.492
Just a second.

01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:24.140
OK.

01:55:24.140 --> 01:55:25.210
So we got one face.

01:55:25.210 --> 01:55:26.460
I'll take another one.

01:55:35.900 --> 01:55:37.150
OK.

01:55:39.250 --> 01:55:40.200
Can you see that?

01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:41.640
OK.

01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:45.330
So you just press a button.

01:55:45.330 --> 01:55:46.580
You don't have to do anything.

01:55:50.444 --> 01:55:51.908
And this is the result.

01:55:51.908 --> 01:55:58.740
[APPLAUSE]

01:55:58.740 --> 01:56:01.930
OREN BENGIGI: And you have
tabs, you can see

01:56:01.930 --> 01:56:03.960
the original faces.

01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:05.860
And sometimes the face
detections go

01:56:05.860 --> 01:56:07.170
wrong, so you can--

01:56:07.170 --> 01:56:11.010
[GONG SOUNDS]

01:56:11.010 --> 01:56:12.260
OREN BENGIGI: Out of time.

01:56:14.850 --> 01:56:17.050
JEREMY LYON: So, when Marco
asked me to work on Face

01:56:17.050 --> 01:56:20.070
Blender, I thought I pretty much
won the lottery out of

01:56:20.070 --> 01:56:22.150
all of the people who were here,
because everybody else

01:56:22.150 --> 01:56:22.600
had to work.

01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:24.620
I got to make goofy pictures.

01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:26.320
It's awesome.

01:56:26.320 --> 01:56:27.900
So if you can go to
the slides, Marco.

01:56:32.130 --> 01:56:32.620
So yeah.

01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:35.475
I pretty much walked around
annoying all of my coworkers

01:56:35.475 --> 01:56:37.590
by forcing them to look into
the camera and take

01:56:37.590 --> 01:56:38.570
pictures with me.

01:56:38.570 --> 01:56:42.690
So this is me and my wife, and
thankfully our children don't

01:56:42.690 --> 01:56:44.290
actually look like this.

01:56:44.290 --> 01:56:45.540
So we're safe there.

01:56:47.970 --> 01:56:52.672
And this is me and our co-worker
Jeff, who has gone.

01:56:52.672 --> 01:56:54.950
Go on to the next one, please.

01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:55.980
Me and Richard Nho.

01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:56.960
He's somewhere around here.

01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:58.620
You may have seen him
earlier today.

01:56:58.620 --> 01:57:01.140
Go to the next one.

01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:04.455
Now this one is actually
me and Sergey, I think.

01:57:04.455 --> 01:57:08.170
No, this is me and Rachel,
actually, taken earlier today.

01:57:08.170 --> 01:57:09.570
One more?

01:57:09.570 --> 01:57:12.070
Here's me and Sergey, with the
glasses on and everything.

01:57:12.070 --> 01:57:13.750
I'm hoping this will
get me promoted.

01:57:13.750 --> 01:57:16.030
I don't know if I'm going to
have that luck or not.

01:57:16.030 --> 01:57:19.300
So obviously this app
is all about fun.

01:57:19.300 --> 01:57:21.490
And if you take a look at the
screen that we're looking at

01:57:21.490 --> 01:57:26.610
right now, there's some very
interesting subtle cues that

01:57:26.610 --> 01:57:28.820
tell you that this app
is all about fun.

01:57:28.820 --> 01:57:32.100
First of all, you've got this
cool, bright, blend

01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:33.140
background.

01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:35.510
You've got that kind of
hand-lettered font, making it

01:57:35.510 --> 01:57:37.260
feel like, hey, come play.

01:57:37.260 --> 01:57:39.080
We're not going to do anything
important here.

01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:40.250
We're going to have fun.

01:57:40.250 --> 01:57:41.940
And you've got the cool
little icon going

01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:43.490
in the corner there.

01:57:43.490 --> 01:57:46.490
So everything about the style
of this screen, I think,

01:57:46.490 --> 01:57:49.330
really says, let's have fun.

01:57:49.330 --> 01:57:51.840
But then you look
at the content.

01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:54.710
And I don't know about you guys,
but file manipulation is

01:57:54.710 --> 01:57:58.400
pretty low on my list
of fun things to do.

01:57:58.400 --> 01:57:59.630
I look at this screen--

01:57:59.630 --> 01:58:02.730
I look at Load and Delete and
About, and I can understand

01:58:02.730 --> 01:58:05.050
how those are important actions,
things that people

01:58:05.050 --> 01:58:07.420
might want to be able to do,
but they aren't fun.

01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:09.330
They take a little bit
away from where I

01:58:09.330 --> 01:58:10.140
really want to go.

01:58:10.140 --> 01:58:13.000
Where I really want to go with
this app is to that first

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:14.410
button there, that
Blend Faces.

01:58:14.410 --> 01:58:15.610
I want to just jump
right in and

01:58:15.610 --> 01:58:18.030
start taking some pictures.

01:58:18.030 --> 01:58:20.890
So we'll talk in a second about
maybe some ways we could

01:58:20.890 --> 01:58:22.920
do that, but let's go on
to the next screen.

01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:24.580
So you hit that Blend
Faces button, and

01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:26.470
this is what you see.

01:58:26.470 --> 01:58:29.280
Again, we've got a nice
consistent feel,

01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:30.390
a consistent style.

01:58:30.390 --> 01:58:33.920
It still keeps that sort
of playful feel to it.

01:58:33.920 --> 01:58:35.820
But there's a lot of
things that you

01:58:35.820 --> 01:58:37.310
can do on this screen.

01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:39.480
If I look at it, there's--

01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:42.520
just for the one key action that
I'm most interested in,

01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:45.220
which is getting a picture
loaded up to start the

01:58:45.220 --> 01:58:47.810
blending process, I've
got six buttons.

01:58:47.810 --> 01:58:50.750
I've got the big, nice
affordance of the picture

01:58:50.750 --> 01:58:53.390
frame, which is where my finger
just is magnetically

01:58:53.390 --> 01:58:54.810
attracted to touch.

01:58:54.810 --> 01:58:56.670
And then I have the Camera
button, and I

01:58:56.670 --> 01:58:57.530
have a Facebook button.

01:58:57.530 --> 01:58:59.910
These are all different ways
of loading up a picture.

01:58:59.910 --> 01:59:02.140
And I have each one of those
for both pictures.

01:59:02.140 --> 01:59:04.840
I've got six different buttons
that I have to look at when

01:59:04.840 --> 01:59:06.200
I'm looking at this screen.

01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:09.570
Which can be a little
intimidating, perhaps.

01:59:09.570 --> 01:59:13.290
And also, I just have to think a
lot harder than I want to to

01:59:13.290 --> 01:59:15.690
work with a fun application.

01:59:15.690 --> 01:59:18.990
So I think I think one of the
things that you should think

01:59:18.990 --> 01:59:21.350
about doing with this
application is really trying

01:59:21.350 --> 01:59:26.090
to get right into taking
that first picture.

01:59:26.090 --> 01:59:29.710
Jumping right into the big
picture frame, before you show

01:59:29.710 --> 01:59:32.910
any of your file manipulation
stuff.

01:59:32.910 --> 01:59:34.700
Jump right into here.

01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:37.780
Show a big picture, maybe show
a button that helps you to

01:59:37.780 --> 01:59:39.950
understand a secondary action.

01:59:39.950 --> 01:59:42.660
I mean, one of the themes, I
think, that at least we've

01:59:42.660 --> 01:59:45.170
been saying for most of the apps
that we've looked at so

01:59:45.170 --> 01:59:47.370
far today is that
less is more--

01:59:47.370 --> 01:59:50.340
that the more you can pull out
of your UI, the more you can

01:59:50.340 --> 01:59:53.410
make decisions about what's the
most important aspect, the

01:59:53.410 --> 01:59:55.570
better off I think you're
going to be.

01:59:55.570 --> 02:00:01.250
So I would look at those six
actions that you've got there.

02:00:01.250 --> 02:00:03.710
Maybe eliminate them down to
three by starting with just

02:00:03.710 --> 02:00:06.150
one picture, and moving
the user along

02:00:06.150 --> 02:00:07.500
to the second picture.

02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:08.070
OREN BENGIGI: Oh,
like a result?

02:00:08.070 --> 02:00:11.110
You go from screen to screen?

02:00:11.110 --> 02:00:11.720
JEREMY LYON: Yeah.

02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:13.540
Yeah, that's one option.

02:00:13.540 --> 02:00:15.540
You want to draw a
little bit, Rich?

02:00:15.540 --> 02:00:18.620
Rich is going to save you all
from seeing my completely

02:00:18.620 --> 02:00:19.870
illegible scribbling.

02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:25.600
And another option can think
about here is, are all three

02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:28.975
of those ways of getting an
image equally important?

02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:34.270
You probably have a better
idea how users use this

02:00:34.270 --> 02:00:34.790
application.

02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:38.060
But I would argue that using the
camera to take a picture,

02:00:38.060 --> 02:00:39.500
that's what I want
to do probably

02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:41.760
about 80% of the time.

02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:45.010
And then picking something from
the gallery, that's kind

02:00:45.010 --> 02:00:47.200
of fun too, because that's
how I got to get

02:00:47.200 --> 02:00:49.280
Sergey's picture in there.

02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:51.200
And Facebook, I can see how that
could be useful, though

02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:53.270
of course I'm a Google+ user,
so I don't know what this

02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:54.440
Facebook thing is.

02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:55.690
But--

02:00:57.880 --> 02:00:59.130
RICHARD FULCHER: So much
smarter than me.

02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:02.920
JEREMY LYON: Yeah.

02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:03.530
Did we switch over?

02:01:03.530 --> 02:01:05.130
Yes.

02:01:05.130 --> 02:01:08.836
It's almost as though you
read my mind, Rich.

02:01:08.836 --> 02:01:10.650
Yeah, this is one option
that we could do.

02:01:10.650 --> 02:01:13.530
What Rich is drawing here is,
we've got a big image in the

02:01:13.530 --> 02:01:16.090
center you could use
for your camera.

02:01:16.090 --> 02:01:20.350
Tap on that big image in the
center and switch to the

02:01:20.350 --> 02:01:21.870
camera view that
you had before.

02:01:21.870 --> 02:01:24.800
And you have a smaller image
so you can see the other

02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:26.460
options that you might
have available.

02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:29.040
Or sorry, what the other picture
is, if you've already

02:01:29.040 --> 02:01:31.190
taken a picture, or is
not, or will soon be

02:01:31.190 --> 02:01:32.840
when you get there.

02:01:32.840 --> 02:01:35.060
And then you could have two
different actions for the

02:01:35.060 --> 02:01:36.410
Facebook and for the camera.

02:01:36.410 --> 02:01:39.270
I might even go further and
say, pick your secondary

02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:44.400
action, link it up to that big
picture, and put your tertiary

02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:47.950
action in the overflow
menu somewhere.

02:01:47.950 --> 02:01:49.780
Which you don't currently have,
but we'll get there.

02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:53.070
What do you think?

02:01:53.070 --> 02:01:54.810
I mean, I don't know if anybody
has other opinions

02:01:54.810 --> 02:01:55.710
about this.

02:01:55.710 --> 02:01:56.940
OREN BENGIGI: What about
the swap button to

02:01:56.940 --> 02:01:59.140
swap between the faces?

02:01:59.140 --> 02:01:59.800
RICHARD FULCHER: I think
you can just

02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:01.030
make it a direct touch.

02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:02.890
So it's like, this is the
face I'm editing now.

02:02:02.890 --> 02:02:05.596
It's larger, so it has
prominence, so I'm going to

02:02:05.596 --> 02:02:08.250
shoot picture, pick from
gallery, or maybe I can just

02:02:08.250 --> 02:02:10.670
kind of tap directly.

02:02:10.670 --> 02:02:14.620
If I tap, you can just kind of
toggle the position of those.

02:02:14.620 --> 02:02:17.740
There's kind of the one active
one, and maybe after I take a

02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:19.270
picture, we automatically
toggle it.

02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:24.130
So it's like, you could even
say Face A, Face 1, take a

02:02:24.130 --> 02:02:26.100
picture, they switch
positions.

02:02:26.100 --> 02:02:27.255
The animation cues
you a little bit

02:02:27.255 --> 02:02:28.430
to the state change.

02:02:28.430 --> 02:02:30.330
Maybe it rotates to be Face 2.

02:02:30.330 --> 02:02:32.530
And then the Blend button is
your nice big target down at

02:02:32.530 --> 02:02:33.250
the bottom.

02:02:33.250 --> 02:02:35.820
I mean, you could also
do this as--

02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:40.130
I kind of like the swap here,
because then you don't have to

02:02:40.130 --> 02:02:41.600
have different screens.

02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:44.230
But you could imagine, the user
could also go through a

02:02:44.230 --> 02:02:48.210
progression of screens where
screen 1 is Face 1.

02:02:48.210 --> 02:02:51.060
And then that glides
over to Face 2.

02:02:51.060 --> 02:02:52.720
And then maybe they don't even
hit the Blend button.

02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:55.440
They just swipe over to see
the blended version.

02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:58.280
So something like
that could work.

02:02:58.280 --> 02:02:59.530
OREN BENGIGI: Yes.

02:03:01.650 --> 02:03:02.930
JEREMY LYON: So that's
screen notes.

02:03:02.930 --> 02:03:05.850
Let's go onto the screen that
you see once you actually have

02:03:05.850 --> 02:03:07.220
finished entering in both.

02:03:07.220 --> 02:03:10.600
So what you're looking
at here is--

02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:12.375
over there, I should
say-- is--

02:03:12.375 --> 02:03:20.140
[LAUGHTER]

02:03:20.140 --> 02:03:21.050
JEREMY LYON: You wouldn't
see all three of

02:03:21.050 --> 02:03:21.950
these at the same time.

02:03:21.950 --> 02:03:26.230
These are three different taps
displayed in this view.

02:03:26.230 --> 02:03:29.550
And the thing I think is most
interesting to note about

02:03:29.550 --> 02:03:32.280
this, especially after we've
looked at the last two

02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:34.890
screens, is that in the last
two screens, we've got this

02:03:34.890 --> 02:03:37.950
nice, colorful background, we've
got the hand-lettering--

02:03:37.950 --> 02:03:39.270
boom.

02:03:39.270 --> 02:03:41.940
Here we're into something that
feels very frameworky.

02:03:41.940 --> 02:03:45.845
We've got this gray action bar,
we've got the blue tabs,

02:03:45.845 --> 02:03:47.310
we've got the white
background.

02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:50.620
It almost feels like I'm in a
different app, and it loses a

02:03:50.620 --> 02:03:54.630
lot of the fun, the
playfulness of

02:03:54.630 --> 02:03:56.670
the previous screens.

02:03:56.670 --> 02:03:59.500
And you might think, working
on Android design, I might

02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:02.330
cheer for the action bar and
the standard framework

02:04:02.330 --> 02:04:05.160
elements here, but I think,
actually, this is a case where

02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:08.260
sticking with the integrity of
your application, the visual

02:04:08.260 --> 02:04:11.370
integrity of your application,
would be the way to go, to

02:04:11.370 --> 02:04:13.440
have that nice, seamless
throw.

02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:16.590
So I'm a little bit curious
about why you chose to go this

02:04:16.590 --> 02:04:18.650
direction with the screen.

02:04:18.650 --> 02:04:22.180
OREN BENGIGI: Well, the idea was
to have the ability to see

02:04:22.180 --> 02:04:23.800
all the different
faces you took,

02:04:23.800 --> 02:04:25.670
including the blended one.

02:04:25.670 --> 02:04:31.360
And sometimes face detection
goes wrong, so you can go and

02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:32.990
edit blend.

02:04:32.990 --> 02:04:39.740
And you can just manually adjust
the detected face, and

02:04:39.740 --> 02:04:45.690
do it to the other
face, like this.

02:04:45.690 --> 02:04:49.340
And once you hit Apply, it
reblends the faces, and you

02:04:49.340 --> 02:04:50.075
get a better result.

02:04:50.075 --> 02:04:53.050
Or worse, I don't know.

02:04:53.050 --> 02:04:54.790
RICHARD FULCHER: I think I've
become a V For Vendetta mask.

02:04:57.780 --> 02:04:59.210
A Ugnaught.

02:04:59.210 --> 02:05:01.840
JEREMY LYON: Well, there might
be some ways to get those same

02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:05.660
kinds of actions available to
you, even using your own

02:05:05.660 --> 02:05:06.890
custom background.

02:05:06.890 --> 02:05:09.770
But one of the things you can
do with action bar-- action

02:05:09.770 --> 02:05:13.710
bar doesn't need to use the
framework gray background.

02:05:13.710 --> 02:05:15.490
You can actually use a
transparent background.

02:05:15.490 --> 02:05:17.330
So you can keep your own
background image there, the

02:05:17.330 --> 02:05:20.260
one that you've had earlier,
and draw that there.

02:05:20.260 --> 02:05:24.850
Likewise, you can change the
font for your app title there.

02:05:24.850 --> 02:05:26.925
You could use the same font that
you were using earlier so

02:05:26.925 --> 02:05:29.010
you keep that consistency.

02:05:29.010 --> 02:05:33.040
And I might look at something
instead of tabs, which are

02:05:33.040 --> 02:05:36.570
effective ways of jumping
between these three screens.

02:05:36.570 --> 02:05:39.050
But going back to what Rich was
drawing, you might think

02:05:39.050 --> 02:05:41.720
about doing this sort of more
direct manipulation.

02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:44.040
I don't know if part of what you
were trying to do here was

02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:49.270
make this image as big as
possible in this view, but you

02:05:49.270 --> 02:05:53.410
might be able to sacrifice a
little bit of space around the

02:05:53.410 --> 02:05:56.840
edges to kind of hint at the A
and the B on either side, or

02:05:56.840 --> 02:05:58.440
perhaps it's a linear
progression--

02:05:58.440 --> 02:06:00.090
I don't know what the right
approach is here--

02:06:00.090 --> 02:06:02.330
where you can directly
manipulate, just swapping

02:06:02.330 --> 02:06:05.790
between the two starting
pictures

02:06:05.790 --> 02:06:07.320
and the blended picture.

02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:10.120
And if you chose to use the
action bar throughout your

02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:13.090
application, even in the earlier
screens that we saw,

02:06:13.090 --> 02:06:17.670
and maintain that playfulness
with the transparency and the

02:06:17.670 --> 02:06:21.720
font changes on the title, you
could put in there your

02:06:21.720 --> 02:06:22.700
overflow menu.

02:06:22.700 --> 02:06:25.570
And that gives you a place to
put things like Load and

02:06:25.570 --> 02:06:29.040
Delete and the actions that
perhaps you don't want to give

02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:30.980
the same kind of prominence to
when you're really trying to

02:06:30.980 --> 02:06:33.570
get someone just to have fun and
start taking pictures, but

02:06:33.570 --> 02:06:36.450
you need to have available
to the user there.

02:06:36.450 --> 02:06:37.310
OREN BENGIGI: Yeah, I agree.

02:06:37.310 --> 02:06:40.482
The interface here is too
serious, I think, for--

02:06:40.482 --> 02:06:42.785
JEREMY LYON: This screen, yes.

02:06:42.785 --> 02:06:44.755
MARCO PAGLIA: Do you want to
show the Skype application?

02:06:44.755 --> 02:06:45.080
JEREMY LYON: Sure.

02:06:45.080 --> 02:06:45.600
What?

02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:47.105
MARCO PAGLIA: The Skype
application as an example.

02:06:47.105 --> 02:06:48.410
JEREMY LYON: Sure.

02:06:48.410 --> 02:06:53.050
MARCO PAGLIA: I think this is
what Jeremy is talking about.

02:06:53.050 --> 02:06:55.600
There are applications
already that have a

02:06:55.600 --> 02:06:56.670
transparent action bar.

02:06:56.670 --> 02:07:00.250
So really, you can keep your
application feeling full

02:07:00.250 --> 02:07:02.420
screen, and you still have that
affordance that's really

02:07:02.420 --> 02:07:06.980
important to have consistent,
which is the overflow menu.

02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:09.850
So there are a lot of ways to
play with your application,

02:07:09.850 --> 02:07:12.640
not to make it feel like, oh,
this is an action bar, and

02:07:12.640 --> 02:07:14.050
this is this element
from the framework.

02:07:14.050 --> 02:07:16.350
You can play with it and make
it feel like a full screen

02:07:16.350 --> 02:07:20.700
experience, and this is
a perfect example.

02:07:20.700 --> 02:07:21.780
JEREMY LYON: Were there
any questions or

02:07:21.780 --> 02:07:23.030
comments from the audience?

02:07:28.720 --> 02:07:31.840
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to think
that, potentially, the

02:07:31.840 --> 02:07:34.140
first page in the app, he could
completely get rid of

02:07:34.140 --> 02:07:37.090
it, and just bring up the second
page, have the action

02:07:37.090 --> 02:07:39.270
bar with the Load, Delete,
and About, and

02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:41.220
basically go right there.

02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:43.510
That's my first idea.

02:07:43.510 --> 02:07:44.520
JEREMY LYON: I think that's
a great idea.

02:07:44.520 --> 02:07:47.360
That's also what I
was suggesting.

02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:50.800
AUDIENCE: So a comment about
the image selection screen.

02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:53.970
I think your suggestion is a
great improvement, but I'm

02:07:53.970 --> 02:07:55.730
still not 100% sold on it.

02:07:55.730 --> 02:07:57.410
I was wondering if maybe--

02:07:57.410 --> 02:08:00.050
you made a comment about your
eyes drawn towards the images

02:08:00.050 --> 02:08:01.480
and you just want
to touch them.

02:08:01.480 --> 02:08:04.740
Maybe there's just two buttons
with the placeholder images.

02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:08.150
When you touch one, there's a
secondary level of choice.

02:08:08.150 --> 02:08:09.140
And I don't know if--

02:08:09.140 --> 02:08:11.850
I'm guilty of not having
reviewed the new Android

02:08:11.850 --> 02:08:14.020
design guidelines, so is there
any affordance that would be

02:08:14.020 --> 02:08:17.510
appropriate to accomplish
that?

02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:18.870
JEREMY LYON: I'm not sure
there's anything that would be

02:08:18.870 --> 02:08:23.550
a common secondary
action level.

02:08:23.550 --> 02:08:26.230
You certainly could tap into
it and have a change in the

02:08:26.230 --> 02:08:26.770
action bar.

02:08:26.770 --> 02:08:29.620
Action bar supports that sort
of behavior, so your action

02:08:29.620 --> 02:08:31.410
bar could add icons
if you want to.

02:08:31.410 --> 02:08:33.650
I had thought about that, too,
when I was looking at this

02:08:33.650 --> 02:08:38.910
app, and I chose not to
recommend that primarily

02:08:38.910 --> 02:08:44.383
because I think that, in order
to make that work well, you

02:08:44.383 --> 02:08:46.070
kind of need to be a little
bit interruptive.

02:08:46.070 --> 02:08:49.790
I tap into this big, beautiful
picture frame, and then I get

02:08:49.790 --> 02:08:52.190
asked how I want to get
the picture in there.

02:08:52.190 --> 02:08:56.940
And I think you could probably
make a good primary choice and

02:08:56.940 --> 02:08:59.850
allow the other ones to kind of
fade into the background,

02:08:59.850 --> 02:09:02.210
so that if someone's looking
for an alternate choice,

02:09:02.210 --> 02:09:04.290
they'll see it, but if they're
not, they don't have to kind

02:09:04.290 --> 02:09:05.990
of mentally parse it.

02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:08.775
That's my theory.

02:09:08.775 --> 02:09:10.690
RICHARD FULCHER: Yeah,
I mean, one other--

02:09:10.690 --> 02:09:13.850
we'll do more questions, but
one other thing to keep in

02:09:13.850 --> 02:09:18.130
mind is, there are lots of
capabilities in Android that

02:09:18.130 --> 02:09:21.680
might not seem like natural
matches for an app like this,

02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:22.840
but really could be great.

02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:26.040
And I think Beam, or the NFC,
could be one of them.

02:09:26.040 --> 02:09:28.060
Imagine you've got two
users that each

02:09:28.060 --> 02:09:29.650
have this app installed.

02:09:29.650 --> 02:09:32.340
They just take their own
pictures and then touch to

02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:34.840
blend, effectively, would
be what you'd be

02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:36.190
doing at that point.

02:09:36.190 --> 02:09:38.680
Because then both users kind
of get that surprise at the

02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:42.860
same time, and it just
kind of shortens it.

02:09:42.860 --> 02:09:43.740
Question?

02:09:43.740 --> 02:09:45.820
AUDIENCE: Well, I had actually
two suggestions.

02:09:45.820 --> 02:09:48.600
So the first was, this is fun.

02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:50.340
People have had it
for a while.

02:09:50.340 --> 02:09:53.280
They might have accumulated
some images

02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:54.110
that they've saved.

02:09:54.110 --> 02:09:58.190
So rather than come up directly
into Face Blender,

02:09:58.190 --> 02:10:01.000
come up with some thumbnails
in a gallery, and have the

02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:04.800
Face Blender button right there,
significant, prominent.

02:10:04.800 --> 02:10:07.710
And be able to show some of
your most recent or pick

02:10:07.710 --> 02:10:11.410
favorites as your
start screen.

02:10:11.410 --> 02:10:14.470
So instead of an empty screen
that you need to fill with

02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:17.370
faces to blend, you've got some
funny ones that you've

02:10:17.370 --> 02:10:18.730
already made.

02:10:18.730 --> 02:10:21.320
The second suggestion
was the tabs.

02:10:21.320 --> 02:10:22.300
Tabs are kind of--

02:10:22.300 --> 02:10:26.410
I love tabs, really, I do, and
three tabs are what I love.

02:10:26.410 --> 02:10:29.280
I have a tab widget app.

02:10:29.280 --> 02:10:30.710
It doesn't work that
well, though.

02:10:30.710 --> 02:10:34.230
You could put like an A on the
left and a B on the right, and

02:10:34.230 --> 02:10:38.820
have the blended face in the
middle-- swipe to see face B,

02:10:38.820 --> 02:10:44.690
swipe to see face A. And maybe
have some options to shrink

02:10:44.690 --> 02:10:46.220
them and have all
three of them.

02:10:46.220 --> 02:10:49.060
Especially in a tablet view,
you could have all three.

02:10:49.060 --> 02:10:51.470
But my suggestion would be to
put the blended face in the

02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:55.660
middle, and not on the end.

02:10:55.660 --> 02:10:57.580
That's what occurred to me.

02:10:57.580 --> 02:10:59.290
JEREMY LYON: To your first
comment, Oren actually has

02:10:59.290 --> 02:11:01.760
developed-- there is a sort of
a gallery viewing widget.

02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:03.800
I just didn't show it in this
UI, because I thought these

02:11:03.800 --> 02:11:07.140
things were the most
important.

02:11:07.140 --> 02:11:07.510
MARCO PAGLIA: OK.

02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:09.441
Last question.

02:11:09.441 --> 02:11:10.700
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask
about the Blend button.

02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:13.560
Because the natural place for
me to put it would be the

02:11:13.560 --> 02:11:14.580
action bar--

02:11:14.580 --> 02:11:17.130
like, one of the actions in the
action bar just blends.

02:11:17.130 --> 02:11:22.510
And then I, myself, found a
problem in one of my apps that

02:11:22.510 --> 02:11:26.315
people don't like it there,
so I put two buttons.

02:11:26.315 --> 02:11:27.740
And this an alternative.

02:11:27.740 --> 02:11:32.490
So I wanted to know what are
your thoughts on this?

02:11:32.490 --> 02:11:35.780
What are your thoughts on two
buttons or the button on the

02:11:35.780 --> 02:11:39.160
action bar, for the
main action in

02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:40.650
the form, like Blend.

02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:44.880
JEREMY LYON: I would usually
put your main

02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:46.550
action in the form.

02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:49.210
If you have something where
there's stuff going on in the

02:11:49.210 --> 02:11:52.170
main part of the screen, like
we have in Face Blender, and

02:11:52.170 --> 02:11:54.600
then an action that acts on all
that stuff that you just

02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:58.550
did, it makes a lot of sense
to embed that in the view

02:11:58.550 --> 02:12:02.730
instead of putting it up
in the action bar.

02:12:02.730 --> 02:12:04.855
If you have--

02:12:04.855 --> 02:12:08.650
I'm thinking of the People
application, for example--

02:12:08.650 --> 02:12:10.390
this is something where you're
doing a lot of different

02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:12.280
things when you're editing
a contact.

02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:15.270
We have the Done button up in
the action bar, that because

02:12:15.270 --> 02:12:20.150
it applies to the entirety of
the screen, and not only just

02:12:20.150 --> 02:12:22.150
the screen that you're viewing
right now, but pieces that you

02:12:22.150 --> 02:12:24.970
may have been looking at,
scrolled up, scrolled down.

02:12:24.970 --> 02:12:30.230
It's less of an immediate
response to the content that's

02:12:30.230 --> 02:12:31.390
immediately above it.

02:12:31.390 --> 02:12:34.730
Instead it's more of a, at this
time, I am now finished.

02:12:34.730 --> 02:12:36.370
So it kind of depends on
how you're using it.

02:12:36.370 --> 02:12:38.940
But what I'm getting a little
bit from your description is,

02:12:38.940 --> 02:12:40.980
I would probably put
that primary action

02:12:40.980 --> 02:12:44.470
in the content itself.

02:12:44.470 --> 02:12:45.270
MARCO PAGLIA: This
is the time.

02:12:45.270 --> 02:12:46.190
[GONG SOUNDS]

02:12:46.190 --> 02:12:46.760
JEREMY LYON: Wait, wait, wait!

02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:48.662
I've got one more picture.

02:12:48.662 --> 02:12:49.510
Go to the next one?

02:12:49.510 --> 02:12:51.890
Just to end with a little--

02:12:51.890 --> 02:12:53.300
This is me and Brad Pitt.

02:12:53.300 --> 02:12:55.490
I was hoping he would improve
me, but I don't think it

02:12:55.490 --> 02:12:57.260
improved either of us,
unfortunately.

02:12:57.260 --> 02:12:58.040
Thanks a lot.

02:12:58.040 --> 02:12:59.290
OREN BENGIGI: Thank you.

02:13:06.330 --> 02:13:08.500
MARCO PAGLIA: So thank
you very much.

02:13:08.500 --> 02:13:14.110
Most of you have been here for
two hours, so pretty much

02:13:14.110 --> 02:13:18.250
thank you for myself, from our
guests, and from our team.
