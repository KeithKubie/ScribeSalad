that's a great question you know when
 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.039
that's a great question you know when
you look at the research what it

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049
you look at the research what it
 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.950
you look at the research what it
suggests is that that there are some

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
suggests is that that there are some
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.759
suggests is that that there are some
differences in in terms of age segments

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769
differences in in terms of age segments
 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.800
differences in in terms of age segments
there are differences in how people use

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810
there are differences in how people use
 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.830
there are differences in how people use
technology there are certain differences

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840
technology there are certain differences
 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.290
technology there are certain differences
in terms of what people want but when

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
in terms of what people want but when
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.460
in terms of what people want but when
you get a little bit lower than that

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470
you get a little bit lower than that
 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.069
you get a little bit lower than that
when you get down to needs the needs are

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079
when you get down to needs the needs are
 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.380
when you get down to needs the needs are
very similar and then when you get down

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390
very similar and then when you get down
 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.049
very similar and then when you get down
to values what you find is that the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059
to values what you find is that the
 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.240
to values what you find is that the
generations are really closely connected

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250
generations are really closely connected
 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.850
generations are really closely connected
in our country this is a powerful force

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860
in our country this is a powerful force
 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.369
in our country this is a powerful force
and so grandparents really care about

and so grandparents really care about
their grandchildren they care about

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820
their grandchildren they care about

their grandchildren they care about
their children and vice versa the

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039
their children and vice versa the
 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.680
their children and vice versa the
grandchildren today young people today

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690

grandparents so you have this real
cohesiveness this connectedness and so

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570
cohesiveness this connectedness and so
 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.569
cohesiveness this connectedness and so
from our standpoint we try to think that

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579
from our standpoint we try to think that
 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.970
from our standpoint we try to think that
way we try to think intergenerationally

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980
way we try to think intergenerationally
 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.920
way we try to think intergenerationally
so it's just to give you an example

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930
so it's just to give you an example
 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.140
so it's just to give you an example
right now we're working very hard at

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150
right now we're working very hard at
 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.280
right now we're working very hard at

and expanded and why do we want to do
that we want to do that because those

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
that we want to do that because those
 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.620
that we want to do that because those
are our grandchildren and because

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630
are our grandchildren and because
 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.289

children are the future of the country
 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.880
children are the future of the country
so that interconnectedness is very

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890
so that interconnectedness is very
 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.870
so that interconnectedness is very
strong and very important

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880
 
 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.540
 
well it's changing quite rapidly and the

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550
well it's changing quite rapidly and the
 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.370
well it's changing quite rapidly and the
reason for this is that as the boomers

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380
reason for this is that as the boomers
 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.200
reason for this is that as the boomers
age and as people in their 60s and 70s

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210
age and as people in their 60s and 70s
 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.200
age and as people in their 60s and 70s
age they tend to be healthier and better

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210
age they tend to be healthier and better
 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.270
age they tend to be healthier and better
educated than previous generations and

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280
educated than previous generations and
 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.060
educated than previous generations and
so you have people living longer and you

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070
so you have people living longer and you
 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.280
so you have people living longer and you
have this huge cohort of boomers 78

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290
have this huge cohort of boomers 78
 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.380
have this huge cohort of boomers 78
million baby boomers coming into their

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390
million baby boomers coming into their
 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.810
million baby boomers coming into their
older years so what all this adds up to

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820
older years so what all this adds up to
 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.460
older years so what all this adds up to
is that our society is aging and as far

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470
is that our society is aging and as far
 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.540
is that our society is aging and as far
as how old is old nobody really knows

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550
as how old is old nobody really knows
 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.910
as how old is old nobody really knows
you know there's a line that that says

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920
you know there's a line that that says
 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.950
you know there's a line that that says
basically old is 10 years older than I

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960
basically old is 10 years older than I
 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:16.270
basically old is 10 years older than I
am the pressing issue for us today is to

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280
am the pressing issue for us today is to
 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.430
am the pressing issue for us today is to
try to get health care fixed because

bankruptcies in this country are due to

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370
bankruptcies in this country are due to
 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.600
bankruptcies in this country are due to
health costs and right now about

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610
health costs and right now about
 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.910
health costs and right now about
two-thirds of all adults in this country

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920
two-thirds of all adults in this country
 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.940
two-thirds of all adults in this country
think that the coming generation is

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950
think that the coming generation is
 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.380
think that the coming generation is
going to be worse off than their parents

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390
going to be worse off than their parents
 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.930
going to be worse off than their parents
and if that happened it would be the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940
and if that happened it would be the
 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.240
and if that happened it would be the
first time in American history and a

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250
first time in American history and a
 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.190
first time in American history and a
major reason for that is health care and

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200
major reason for that is health care and
 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.770
major reason for that is health care and
also financial security not being able

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780
also financial security not being able
 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.410
also financial security not being able
to save enough for retirement pensions

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350
work so these are the issues that are
 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.050

top of the agenda for us

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060
 
 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:22.470
 
I think the young have a responsibility

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480
I think the young have a responsibility
 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.449
I think the young have a responsibility
to the old and very definitely older

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459
to the old and very definitely older
 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.370

young there's no question every
 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.900
young there's no question every
generation has to be responsible to the

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910
generation has to be responsible to the
 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.729
generation has to be responsible to the
other that's what that's what society is

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739
other that's what that's what society is
 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.300
other that's what that's what society is
built upon and you know there was a

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310
built upon and you know there was a
 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.490
built upon and you know there was a
congressman who came to the AARP board

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500
congressman who came to the AARP board
 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.940
congressman who came to the AARP board
one day and he said you know that young

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950
one day and he said you know that young
 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.699
one day and he said you know that young
people have to pay for older people to

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709
people have to pay for older people to
 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.009
people have to pay for older people to
receive Social Security and I'm going to

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019
receive Social Security and I'm going to
 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.630

going to make them madder than hell
about this and of course there is no

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390
about this and of course there is no
 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.039
about this and of course there is no
intergenerational warfare in this

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049
intergenerational warfare in this
 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.320

care about each other and if we do that

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019
care about each other and if we do that
 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:16.890
care about each other and if we do that
we'll be a better society well I think
