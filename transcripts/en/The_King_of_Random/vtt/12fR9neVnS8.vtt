00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.350
In a previous project I went to the hobby
store and picked up some F-class rocket motors,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.860
to try launching a rocket, made out of pool
noodles. Now these motors are amazing, but

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.720
the catch is they’re $17 each. So in this
project let’s see if we can use powdered sugar and

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.150
kitty litter, to make a homemade version,
that will rocket up over 2,000 feet high,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.569
and cost less than $0.50 make.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.200
To 
start this project we’ll need powdered sugar,
potassium nitrate, and a cheap bag of kitty

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.740
litter. We’re also going to need 3/4”
PVC tubing and a 3/4” oak dowel. This is

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.790
schedule 40 PVC, and you can see I’ve cut
the tube into sections 5” long, exactly.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.480
The dowel is twice as long as that, and you
can see if we push it inside the tube, it’s

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.130
actually a pretty good fit. This will be a
ramming rod, and a template as well. And the

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.920
markings you see on the stick are designed
to make the simplest form of an “E45 equivalent”

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.230
rocket motor. The markings are actually in
reverse order to how we’re going to build

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.630
it, but you’ll see why it needs to be that
way in just a minute. Alright, let’s get

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.829
ready to make the rocket fuel, and to start
off we’re going to need a small blender

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:10.770
that we’re not afraid to damage. I found
this one at a local thrift shop for $5, and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.490
the first thing we have to do is measure out
65 grams of potassium nitrate. I typically

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.549
get mine as a special brand of stump remover,
and it’s a pretty fine grain to begin with,

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.249
but you can see that after blending it up
for about 20 seconds, it becomes a fluffy

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:27.369
white powder, that looks a lot like powdered
sugar. Now speaking of powdered sugar, we’re

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.469
going to need some of that next. So let’s
zero out our scale, and add exactly 35 grams

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:37.170
of sugar to the mix. At this point the powder
is a pyrotechnic composition that could ignite

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.600
with too much heat, so instead of mixing this
up with the blender, we’re going to have

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.009
to shake it by hand for about 3 minutes. This
should give it enough time to blend completely,

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.729
and that’s important because we need this
white mix to be as intimate as possible. Alright,

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.920
our rocket fuel is finished, so let’s transfer
it to another container to free up the blender,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.880
because now it’s time to bring out the kitty
litter. This 7 lb bag was only $0.98, and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.929
surprisingly, the cheap kind is the best kind,
because it doesn’t have any fragrances or

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:07.240
dyes added to it. It’s just a big bag full
of bentonite clay, which is probably why the

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.640
stuff is as cheap as dirt. Alright let’s
throw a handful of clay into the blender for

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.530
10-20 seconds so it grinds into a power. Holding
the blender at a bit of an angle helps mix

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.200
it better, and reduces the load, on the motor
as well. Now when it’s time to remove the

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.820
lid, it’s important to wear a mask, or do
it outside. Because you can see the powder

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.560
is so fine it escapes like a gas, and its
not really good to breathe this stuff in.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.180
Ok, we’ve got everything we need, so let’s
get to work putting it all together. Place

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.710
one of the PVC casings on a slab of concrete,
and drop in a third of a tablespoon of kitty

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.810
litter. Now let’s make sure we keep the
tube firmly on the concrete so the clay doesn’t

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.120
spill out the bottom, then slide the oak ramming
rod inside, and smack the top firmly with

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.430
a rubber mallet. It’s going to need about
5-10 good whacks, to compact it as tight as

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.900
we need it. And you can see it will make a
nice little clay plug, at the bottom of the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.950
tube. Let’s repeat this process 2 more times
until the plug is 3/4” thick, which you

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.770
can see is conveniently indicated by the marking
on the stick. 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.610
If too
much clay gets packed in, no worries. You

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.440
can just twist the dowel around a few times
to loosen the top layer, then pour out the

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.920
extra clay until it lines up perfectly. At
this point, we’re ready to add the white

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.710
mix. This stuff is extremely light and fluffy,
so it’s important to push the ram rod down,

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.670
very slowly. Once it’s compacted by hand

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.390
though, we can ram it with the mallet, just
like we did the clay, until the rammed “white

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.930
mix” lines up perfectly with the next marking.
The last step for this simple motor is a kitty

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.130
litter end cap. This will be 3/4” thick
as well, the same as the one we made before.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.190
But here you can see there’s still a little
room left in the tube, and you’ll see what

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.810
that’s for in another project video. Ok
our rocket motor is just about finished. The

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.810
only thing left to do is make the nozzle.
For these motors I use a 7/32” drill bit,

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.020
which happens to be the exact length and width
we need to turn this rammed powder tube, into

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:55.090
a core burning rocket. Now to gauge the depth
on how far in to drill, we can use the markings

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.290
on the ram rod to measure exactly where the
white mix ends, then mark the drill bit at

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.720
the point where it lines up with the clay.
Now it’s really important to drill this

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.120
out very slowly and carefully because, remember,
this is a rocket motor, and you don’t want

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.140
to set it off by accident. I’m drilling
mine out by hand, so it’s easy to control

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.350
any heat generated, from the friction. When
the marking on the bit lines up with the bottom

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.480
of the casing, the rocket motor is finished
and should look something like this. Now to

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.590
test the power of these motors I went way
out into the dessert, miles and miles away

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.780
from any people, property or anything flammable.
When this one lit off I was blown away by

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.660
what it could do. The motor, just shot up
2,300 feet high. And of course if we’ve

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.320
got rockets going that high, we’re going
to need a way to deploy, some kind of a recovery

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.700
system. So the next step, is to give our rocket
motors a built in time delay, and a parachute

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.860
ejection charge. The 100 gram batch in this
video is enough to make two “E45 equivalent”

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.080
motors, with about 20 grams of propellent
left over. Which is what I mix with baking

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.730
soda, to slow the burn, and create a 5 second
delay. So watch for those modifications in

00:04:55.730 --> 00:05:00.660
another video. Well now you know how to repurpose
some simple household items, into powerful

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.630
hobby rocket motors, for less than $0.50 each.
Just make sure you have the right permits,

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.880
location, and common sense before you try
launching them. Well that’s it for now.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.240

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.840
If you are even considering the thought of
trying to build one of these, please promise

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.280
me you’ll do one thing first. Get on google
and do a search for local rocket clubs. They

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.430
don’t cost much, and they’ll have the
best idea of how to keep you out of trouble

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.340
with the FAA, and make sure nobody gets hurt.
Having said all that, I hope you felt the

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.139
same excitement for this project that I did.
I’ve spent 4 years playing with different

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:40.190
variations of sugar motors to get to this
point, so I’m super excited to finally be

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.590
able to present this to you. Now going forward,
you can expect to see a few more rocket related

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.139
videos, and then we’re getting into metal
melting projects, so please make sure you’re

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.780
subscribed to my channel because I’d really
like to see you around for those project videos.

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:52.930
I’ll talk to you then.
