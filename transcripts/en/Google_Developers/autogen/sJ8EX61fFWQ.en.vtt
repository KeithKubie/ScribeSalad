with so much of our lives moving online
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.479
with so much of our lives moving online
it's imperative we're taking steps to to

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489
it's imperative we're taking steps to to
 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.420
it's imperative we're taking steps to to
protect our data in our users data so so

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430
protect our data in our users data so so
 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.270

this talk is my call to arms to all of

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280
this talk is my call to arms to all of
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.100
this talk is my call to arms to all of
you as developers and in the next 30

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110
you as developers and in the next 30
 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.740
you as developers and in the next 30
minutes I hope to convince you about the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750
minutes I hope to convince you about the
 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.139
minutes I hope to convince you about the
necessity and practicality of SSL and

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149
necessity and practicality of SSL and
 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.500
necessity and practicality of SSL and
then give you some pointers to show you

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
then give you some pointers to show you
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.619
then give you some pointers to show you
how to how to actually make that happen

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629
how to how to actually make that happen
 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.689
how to how to actually make that happen
so this is probably a good place to

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699
so this is probably a good place to
 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.529
so this is probably a good place to
start

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539

there's a couple of acronyms that are

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229
there's a couple of acronyms that are
 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.380
there's a couple of acronyms that are
thrown around interchangeably so so very

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390
thrown around interchangeably so so very
 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.770

quickly I'll clarify these TLS if you've

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
quickly I'll clarify these TLS if you've
 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.440
quickly I'll clarify these TLS if you've
heard of it is for most intents and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450
heard of it is for most intents and
 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.539
heard of it is for most intents and
purposes the same as SSL you can you can

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
purposes the same as SSL you can you can
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.179
purposes the same as SSL you can you can
consider them synonyms if we want to be

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189
consider them synonyms if we want to be
 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.770

SSL 3.1 was renamed to tls/ssl was the

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189
SSL 3.1 was renamed to tls/ssl was the
 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.730
SSL 3.1 was renamed to tls/ssl was the
original name of the specification when

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740
original name of the specification when
 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.530
original name of the specification when
this came out in the mid 90s from

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540
this came out in the mid 90s from
 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.980
this came out in the mid 90s from
Netscape and TLS is the IETF standard

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990
Netscape and TLS is the IETF standard
 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.959
Netscape and TLS is the IETF standard
name but they're interchangeable I will

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969
name but they're interchangeable I will
 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.389
name but they're interchangeable I will
refer to this as the protocol as SSL

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399
refer to this as the protocol as SSL
 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.910
refer to this as the protocol as SSL
throughout this talk and then HTTPS is

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920
throughout this talk and then HTTPS is
 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.070
throughout this talk and then HTTPS is
HTTP

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080
HTTP
 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.990
HTTP
over SSL and I imagine most people are

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000
over SSL and I imagine most people are
 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.120
over SSL and I imagine most people are
familiar with this too it's actually not

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130
familiar with this too it's actually not
 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.040
familiar with this too it's actually not
a protocol but it's really just the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050
a protocol but it's really just the
 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.830
a protocol but it's really just the
layering of the security capabilities of

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840
layering of the security capabilities of
 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.610
layering of the security capabilities of
SSL and standard HTTP so if you're into

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620
SSL and standard HTTP so if you're into
 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.920
SSL and standard HTTP so if you're into
internet protocol stacks this is how it

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930
internet protocol stacks this is how it
 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.990
internet protocol stacks this is how it
looks I'll leave it as an exercise for

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000
looks I'll leave it as an exercise for
 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.220
looks I'll leave it as an exercise for
all of you guys to read about the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230
all of you guys to read about the
 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.520
all of you guys to read about the
specifics of the SSL protocol but you

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530
specifics of the SSL protocol but you
 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:39.840
specifics of the SSL protocol but you
should know that it consists of two

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850
should know that it consists of two
 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.720
should know that it consists of two
phases so there's this first initial

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730
phases so there's this first initial
 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.710
phases so there's this first initial
phase between the client often case your

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720
phase between the client often case your
 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.870
phase between the client often case your
browser and the web server and this is

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:48.880
browser and the web server and this is
 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.740
browser and the web server and this is
based on public private key cryptography

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750
based on public private key cryptography
 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.780
based on public private key cryptography
this initial part of the protocol is a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790
this initial part of the protocol is a
 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.940
this initial part of the protocol is a
handshake which is used to create a

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950
handshake which is used to create a
 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.360
handshake which is used to create a
shared key a shared secret and the

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370
shared key a shared secret and the
 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.770
shared key a shared secret and the
shared secret is used by the second part

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780
shared secret is used by the second part
 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.300
shared secret is used by the second part
of the SSL protocol to actually encrypt

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310
of the SSL protocol to actually encrypt
 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.140
of the SSL protocol to actually encrypt
the communication of a session so

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150
the communication of a session so
 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.370
the communication of a session so
networking on the Internet it feels safe

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380
networking on the Internet it feels safe
 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.740
networking on the Internet it feels safe

really hard for me to do a presentation

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450
really hard for me to do a presentation
 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.330
really hard for me to do a presentation
without including some comic because

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340
without including some comic because
 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.970
without including some comic because
there's always something relevant

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980
there's always something relevant
 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.540
there's always something relevant
I'll give people a second to to note our

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550
I'll give people a second to to note our
 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.190
I'll give people a second to to note our

I'm gonna go over just two tools that

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750
I'm gonna go over just two tools that
 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.240
I'm gonna go over just two tools that
make these types of man-in-the-middle

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:08.250
make these types of man-in-the-middle
 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.360
make these types of man-in-the-middle
attacks really easy I encourage you to

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370
attacks really easy I encourage you to
 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.100
attacks really easy I encourage you to
check them out maybe someone is running

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110
check them out maybe someone is running
 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.950
check them out maybe someone is running
them in the audience right now but the

the middle attacks have been known about
 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.010
the middle attacks have been known about
for a really long time

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020
for a really long time

this tool came out in 2009 just as kind

this tool came out in 2009 just as kind
of a proof of concept of how easy these

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610
of a proof of concept of how easy these
 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:31.159
of a proof of concept of how easy these
are to actually mount but what SSL strip

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169
are to actually mount but what SSL strip
 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.180
are to actually mount but what SSL strip
does is it exploits the fact that

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190
does is it exploits the fact that
 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.880
does is it exploits the fact that
often sites are still sending some

often sites are still sending some
 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.740
often sites are still sending some

Firesheep this one came out following
 

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:22.910
Firesheep this one came out following
year in 2010 and it was much more usable

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:22.920
year in 2010 and it was much more usable
 

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.110
year in 2010 and it was much more usable
from an attacker standpoint you had a

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120
from an attacker standpoint you had a
 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.900
from an attacker standpoint you had a
nice a nice user interface so that's

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:26.910
nice a nice user interface so that's
 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:28.430
nice a nice user interface so that's
probably why I got a little bit more

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440
probably why I got a little bit more

so far as to say that SSL is is easy to

00:12:04.259 --> 00:12:04.269
so far as to say that SSL is is easy to
 

00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:07.110
so far as to say that SSL is is easy to
deploy it's deceptively easy to deploy

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120
deploy it's deceptively easy to deploy
 

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.780
deploy it's deceptively easy to deploy
in fact so there's a couple mistakes the

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:09.790
in fact so there's a couple mistakes the
 

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.389
in fact so there's a couple mistakes the
people need to avoid but there's a

00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399
people need to avoid but there's a
 

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:13.499
people need to avoid but there's a
really useful guide that's put out by

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:13.509
really useful guide that's put out by
 

00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:16.740
really useful guide that's put out by
SSL labs comm and it goes over all of

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:16.750
SSL labs comm and it goes over all of
 

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.449
SSL labs comm and it goes over all of
the things that you need to do in detail

00:12:18.449 --> 00:12:18.459
the things that you need to do in detail
 

00:12:18.459 --> 00:12:20.699

and more importantly has an automated
 

00:12:20.709 --> 00:12:22.590
and more importantly has an automated
tester so you can actually check that

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:22.600
tester so you can actually check that
 

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.230
tester so you can actually check that
you did everything right and and fix all

00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:25.240
you did everything right and and fix all
 

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.269
you did everything right and and fix all
the mistakes and and then feel confident

00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279
the mistakes and and then feel confident
 

00:12:27.279 --> 00:12:28.259
the mistakes and and then feel confident
that you're you're getting all these

it's cheap it's easy get it and then
 

00:12:37.079 --> 00:12:39.660
it's cheap it's easy get it and then
let's get it right so you can test for

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:39.670
let's get it right so you can test for
 

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.879
let's get it right so you can test for
your actual SSL deployment using SSL

00:12:41.879 --> 00:12:41.889

they visit your sites at least in Chrome
and Firefox so how do we actually fix

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:00.870
and Firefox so how do we actually fix
 

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:02.900

mixed content bugs thankfully it's it's

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:02.910
mixed content bugs thankfully it's it's
 

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.449
mixed content bugs thankfully it's it's
it's fairly easy but we need to do is

00:16:05.449 --> 00:16:05.459
it's fairly easy but we need to do is
 

00:16:05.459 --> 00:16:07.160
it's fairly easy but we need to do is
make sure that all of our resources are

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:07.170
make sure that all of our resources are
 

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:10.819
make sure that all of our resources are
loaded by HTTPS that are loaded on an

00:16:10.819 --> 00:16:10.829
loaded by HTTPS that are loaded on an
 

00:16:10.829 --> 00:16:14.870
loaded by HTTPS that are loaded on an
HTTPS page by HTTPS so if these

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880
HTTPS page by HTTPS so if these
 

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.759
HTTPS page by HTTPS so if these
resources are on the same domain you can

00:16:16.759 --> 00:16:16.769
resources are on the same domain you can
 

00:16:16.769 --> 00:16:20.120
resources are on the same domain you can
just use relative URLs if you have to

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:20.130
just use relative URLs if you have to
 

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:21.680
just use relative URLs if you have to
use an absolute path you want to omit

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:21.690
use an absolute path you want to omit
 

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.250
use an absolute path you want to omit
the scheme or the protocol and the

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:25.260
the scheme or the protocol and the
 

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.410
the scheme or the protocol and the
browser will figure it out by itself in

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.420
browser will figure it out by itself in
 

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.660
browser will figure it out by itself in
the second example I actually include an

the second example I actually include an
 

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.600
the second example I actually include an
example of a scheme relative URL which

example of a scheme relative URL which
 

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.340

can look kind of funky if you've never
 

00:16:34.350 --> 00:16:39.260
can look kind of funky if you've never
seen it before but it works so that's

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:39.270
seen it before but it works so that's
 

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:41.329
