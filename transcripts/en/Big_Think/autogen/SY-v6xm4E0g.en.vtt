00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.000
so a big part of it is that materials we

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.010
so a big part of it is that materials we
 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.769
so a big part of it is that materials we
chose so we chose very acoustically

00:00:04.769 --> 00:00:04.779
chose so we chose very acoustically
 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.099
chose so we chose very acoustically
friendly materials lots of foam or i

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:08.109
friendly materials lots of foam or i
 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.390
friendly materials lots of foam or i
should say felt some foam cork stacked

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400
should say felt some foam cork stacked
 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.039
should say felt some foam cork stacked
materials at different sizes and

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:14.049
materials at different sizes and
 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:15.930
materials at different sizes and
different i don't know how to put it but

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940
different i don't know how to put it but
 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.820
different i don't know how to put it but
they're stacked at different levels so

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830
they're stacked at different levels so
 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.440
they're stacked at different levels so
the sound reflects instead of bouncing

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450
the sound reflects instead of bouncing
 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.480
the sound reflects instead of bouncing
around and echoes and stuff like that we

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490
around and echoes and stuff like that we
 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.610
around and echoes and stuff like that we
get rid of that goes we have sound

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:23.620
get rid of that goes we have sound
 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.470
get rid of that goes we have sound
insulated rooms that we do use when we

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480
insulated rooms that we do use when we
 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.000
insulated rooms that we do use when we
do need to talk to other people so we

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010
do need to talk to other people so we
 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:28.830
do need to talk to other people so we
have this idea of we do have an open

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840
have this idea of we do have an open
 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.420
have this idea of we do have an open
workspace so everyone has an open desk

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430
workspace so everyone has an open desk
 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.400
workspace so everyone has an open desk
but we also have these things called

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410
but we also have these things called
 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.620
but we also have these things called
team rooms and when two or more people

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630
team rooms and when two or more people
 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.450
team rooms and when two or more people
are talking we say go get a room you

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460
are talking we say go get a room you
 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.460
are talking we say go get a room you
know go get a room they go get a room

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470
know go get a room they go get a room
 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.110
know go get a room they go get a room
and the room is sound isolated so they

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120
and the room is sound isolated so they
 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.330
and the room is sound isolated so they
can have a conversation loud if they

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340
can have a conversation loud if they
 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.010
can have a conversation loud if they
want but not bother everyone else is

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020
want but not bother everyone else is
 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.870
want but not bother everyone else is
working and that's the big thing that's

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:45.880
working and that's the big thing that's
 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.549
working and that's the big thing that's
really important about our space that we

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559
really important about our space that we
 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:48.750
really important about our space that we
do have places for people to get

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760
do have places for people to get
 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.790
do have places for people to get
together and talk but their sound

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800
together and talk but their sound
 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.620
together and talk but their sound
isolated and insulated so they don't

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630
isolated and insulated so they don't
 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.390
isolated and insulated so they don't
interrupt everybody else in space

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400
 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.310
think the modern sort of cool workplace

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320
think the modern sort of cool workplace
 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.580
think the modern sort of cool workplace
is the open loft wood floors everyone

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590
is the open loft wood floors everyone
 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.020
is the open loft wood floors everyone
out in the open collaborating all the

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030
out in the open collaborating all the
 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.520
out in the open collaborating all the
time are talking all the time and the

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530
time are talking all the time and the
 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.930
time are talking all the time and the
difference or the thing I think that's

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940
difference or the thing I think that's
 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:07.980
difference or the thing I think that's
important to keep in mind is that

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990
important to keep in mind is that
 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.750
important to keep in mind is that
interruption and collaboration are

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760
interruption and collaboration are
 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.400
interruption and collaboration are
different things and the modern

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410
different things and the modern
 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.200
different things and the modern
workplace with the open workspace and

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210
workplace with the open workspace and
 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.420
workplace with the open workspace and
lots of hard materials everywhere and

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430
lots of hard materials everywhere and
 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.580
lots of hard materials everywhere and
people cramped in to you know really

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590
people cramped in to you know really
 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.650
people cramped in to you know really
close to one another it just encourages

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660
close to one another it just encourages
 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.760
close to one another it just encourages
interruption it doesn't encourage

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770
interruption it doesn't encourage
 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.920
interruption it doesn't encourage
collaboration and so if you really want

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930
collaboration and so if you really want
 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.060
collaboration and so if you really want
to get creative and really want to work

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070
to get creative and really want to work
 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.500
to get creative and really want to work
on something you need uninterruptedly

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510
on something you need uninterruptedly
 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:27.810
on something you need uninterruptedly
time to get those things done and if

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820
time to get those things done and if
 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.710
time to get those things done and if
someone's calling your name you're

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720
someone's calling your name you're
 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.940
someone's calling your name you're
sitting really close to somebody else

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950
sitting really close to somebody else
 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.620
sitting really close to somebody else
it's very hard to actually find that

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630
it's very hard to actually find that
 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.520
it's very hard to actually find that
time and i think that the trait while

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530
time and i think that the trait while
 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.260
time and i think that the trait while
there's some good stuff about being able

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270
there's some good stuff about being able
 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.240
there's some good stuff about being able
to see people all the time and walk past

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250
to see people all the time and walk past
 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.770
to see people all the time and walk past
people and there's some nice stuff that

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780
people and there's some nice stuff that
 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.080
people and there's some nice stuff that
happens in those environments i think

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090
happens in those environments i think
 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.040
happens in those environments i think
that it should be more the exception

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050
that it should be more the exception
 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.830
that it should be more the exception
than the rule

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840
 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.419
the way we've kind of done is for the

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429
the way we've kind of done is for the
 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:50.770
the way we've kind of done is for the
past 10 years we've been writing on our

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780
past 10 years we've been writing on our
 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.389
past 10 years we've been writing on our
blog with a blog called signal versus

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399
blog with a blog called signal versus
 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.429
blog with a blog called signal versus
noise and we've been writing all of our

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439
noise and we've been writing all of our
 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:55.660
noise and we've been writing all of our
ideas down and sharing them with

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670
ideas down and sharing them with
 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.099
ideas down and sharing them with
everybody else because we figure if

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109
everybody else because we figure if
 

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:58.719
everybody else because we figure if
they're valuable for us I'm sure

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729
they're valuable for us I'm sure
 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:59.919
they're valuable for us I'm sure
somewhere else could benefit from them

00:01:59.919 --> 00:01:59.929
somewhere else could benefit from them
 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:01.749
somewhere else could benefit from them
it doesn't cost as much to write these

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759
it doesn't cost as much to write these
 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.309
it doesn't cost as much to write these
things down we talk about them or write

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319
things down we talk about them or write
 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:04.630
things down we talk about them or write
them down internally so why not share

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640
them down internally so why not share
 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.149
them down internally so why not share
them externally too and so over ten

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159
them externally too and so over ten
 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.410
them externally too and so over ten
years we've been running down these

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420
years we've been running down these
 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.389
years we've been running down these
things about design and programming and

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399
things about design and programming and
 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.130
things about design and programming and
business and marketing and sales and all

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140
business and marketing and sales and all
 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.449
business and marketing and sales and all
the stuff that we have to do every day

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459
the stuff that we have to do every day
 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.119
the stuff that we have to do every day
and then we looked back on it and said

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:16.129
and then we looked back on it and said
 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:17.830
and then we looked back on it and said
maybe we could turn all these blog posts

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840
maybe we could turn all these blog posts
 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.229
maybe we could turn all these blog posts
into a book maybe we can take the stuff

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239
into a book maybe we can take the stuff
 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.759
into a book maybe we can take the stuff
we've already written and turn it into a

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769
we've already written and turn it into a
 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.170
we've already written and turn it into a
book and polish it up and give it a

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180
book and polish it up and give it a
 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.120
book and polish it up and give it a
single voice but let's do that instead

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130
single voice but let's do that instead
 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.240
single voice but let's do that instead
so rework and getting real before it

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250
so rework and getting real before it
 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.300
so rework and getting real before it
which was our other book are not things

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310
which was our other book are not things
 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.339
which was our other book are not things
we sat down to decided and decided to

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349
we sat down to decided and decided to
 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:34.930
we sat down to decided and decided to
write there are actually things we sat

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940
write there are actually things we sat
 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.280
write there are actually things we sat
down and looked back and found the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290
down and looked back and found the
 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.569
down and looked back and found the
things we've already written and then

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579
things we've already written and then
 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.729
things we've already written and then
compiled them together so these aren't

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739
compiled them together so these aren't
 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.380
compiled them together so these aren't
these aren't new ideas these are old

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390
these aren't new ideas these are old
 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:42.910
these aren't new ideas these are old
ideas these are ideas that we've tried

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920
ideas these are ideas that we've tried
 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.500
ideas these are ideas that we've tried
and we've tested and we put out there

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510
and we've tested and we put out there
 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.210
and we've tested and we put out there
and that's why I think the books are

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220
and that's why I think the books are
 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.819
and that's why I think the books are
valuable because they're not theoretical

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:48.829
valuable because they're not theoretical
 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.470
valuable because they're not theoretical
they're not academic they're not in a

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480
they're not academic they're not in a
 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.640
they're not academic they're not in a
perfect world this is how it should work

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650
perfect world this is how it should work
 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.170
perfect world this is how it should work
it's actually this is how it has worked

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180
it's actually this is how it has worked
 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.000
