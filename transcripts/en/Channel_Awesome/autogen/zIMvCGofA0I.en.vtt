climax is great I I really like seeing
how Dumbo and his mom jumbo turn out and

00:07:58.529 --> 00:07:58.539
how Dumbo and his mom jumbo turn out and
 

00:07:58.539 --> 00:08:04.260
how Dumbo and his mom jumbo turn out and
what happens to them and then I'm just

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:04.270
what happens to them and then I'm just
 

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.430
what happens to them and then I'm just
kind of left

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.440
 
 

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:14.770
 
wanting so much from the actual humans

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:14.780
wanting so much from the actual humans
 

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.300
wanting so much from the actual humans
in this movie I think the kids are

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:16.310
in this movie I think the kids are
 

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.600
in this movie I think the kids are
pretty miscast I think that maybe that's

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:19.610
pretty miscast I think that maybe that's
 

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:20.110
pretty miscast I think that maybe that's
not true

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.120
not true
 

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.550
not true
because I think that the adults that I

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:21.560
because I think that the adults that I
 

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.530
because I think that the adults that I
really enjoyed I wanted more from them

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:23.540
really enjoyed I wanted more from them
 

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.520
really enjoyed I wanted more from them
so why would I

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:24.530
so why would I
 

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:26.470
so why would I
I just don't know who the kids are so

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:26.480
I just don't know who the kids are so
 

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.180
I just don't know who the kids are so
maybe that's why I'm saying that I think

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:28.190
maybe that's why I'm saying that I think
 

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.520
maybe that's why I'm saying that I think
I don't know the actors were not it was

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:30.530
I don't know the actors were not it was
 

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.950
I don't know the actors were not it was
just such a killer cast so I I don't

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:32.960
just such a killer cast so I I don't
 

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.839
just such a killer cast so I I don't
know I think they weren't given what

00:08:34.839 --> 00:08:34.849
know I think they weren't given what
 

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:36.850
know I think they weren't given what
they needed somehow and I don't know

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:36.860
they needed somehow and I don't know
 

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.230
they needed somehow and I don't know
what that would have been it's gotta be

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240
what that would have been it's gotta be
 

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.120
what that would have been it's gotta be
in the writing it really has to be in

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:40.130
in the writing it really has to be in
 

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.649
in the writing it really has to be in
the writing because direct orally

00:08:41.649 --> 00:08:41.659
