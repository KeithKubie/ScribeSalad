this horrible mass murderer isn't really
 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.779
this horrible mass murderer isn't really
guilty of his works because it was

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789
guilty of his works because it was
 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.150
guilty of his works because it was

even mass murderers were predetermined

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660
even mass murderers were predetermined

in jail Heisenberg then comes along and

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
in jail Heisenberg then comes along and
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.529
in jail Heisenberg then comes along and
proposes the Heisenberg uncertainty

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539
proposes the Heisenberg uncertainty
 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.830
proposes the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle and says nonsense there's

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840
principle and says nonsense there's
 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.720
principle and says nonsense there's
uncertainty you don't know where the

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730
uncertainty you don't know where the
 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.090
uncertainty you don't know where the
electron is it could be here here or

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100
electron is it could be here here or
 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.010

this of course I'm Stein hated because

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149
this of course I'm Stein hated because

well hey get used to it

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059
well hey get used to it
 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.410

Einstein was wrong God does play dice

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420

every time we look at an electron it

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729
every time we look at an electron it
 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.609
every time we look at an electron it
moves there's uncertainty with regards

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619
moves there's uncertainty with regards
 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.440
moves there's uncertainty with regards
to the position of the electron so what

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
to the position of the electron so what
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.780
to the position of the electron so what
does that mean for free will it means in

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790
does that mean for free will it means in
 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.090
does that mean for free will it means in
some sense we do have some kind of free

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100
some sense we do have some kind of free
 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.030
some sense we do have some kind of free

events given your past history there's

there's always the possibility of

there's always the possibility of
 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.810
there's always the possibility of
uncertainty in whatever we do so when I

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
uncertainty in whatever we do so when I
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.240

look at myself in a mirror I say to

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250
look at myself in a mirror I say to
 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.310
look at myself in a mirror I say to
myself what I'm looking at is not really

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320
myself what I'm looking at is not really
 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.760
myself what I'm looking at is not really
me it looks like me but it's not really

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770
me it looks like me but it's not really
 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.420
me it looks like me but it's not really
me at all it's not me today now it's be

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430
me at all it's not me today now it's be
 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.039
me at all it's not me today now it's be
a billionth of a second ago because it

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049
a billionth of a second ago because it
 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.359
a billionth of a second ago because it
takes a billionth of a second for light

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369
takes a billionth of a second for light
 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.170
takes a billionth of a second for light
to go from me to the mirror and by
