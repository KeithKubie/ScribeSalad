[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:04.284 --> 00:00:08.568
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.518 --> 00:00:11.060
JASON SPERO: I was
talking to a group

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.273
out front while we were
getting set up in the room.

00:00:13.273 --> 00:00:14.690
And there's an
interesting balance

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.982
to strike between all the
different things that you do.

00:00:16.982 --> 00:00:19.520
But I thought I would start,
given the title of the book--

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.190
can you help us
with a definition?

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.328
You have said "bravery
will set us free."

00:00:24.328 --> 00:00:26.870
But can you kick us off with a
working definition of bravery?

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.830
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yeah.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.240
So bravery, to me, it's
not dragon slaying, right?

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.480
It's not saving a baby
from a burning building.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.320
Bravery is about joy, joy to do
the things that you want to do.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.240
A perfect example of this is,
basically, a fourth grader

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:45.650
named Ainsley.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.030
So Ainsley lives
in North Carolina.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.180
And it was Princess
Week at her school.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.340
So Ainsley shows up
dressed like a hot dog.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.200
Right?

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.870
Bravery, to me, means
like going to Princess

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.630
Week like a hot dog.

00:01:00.538 --> 00:01:02.580
JASON SPERO: I also forgot
something in the open.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.240
Raise your hand.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.470
There's a group of
high school students

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.940
who are part of a
Girls Who Code club.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:06.000
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yay.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.510
JASON SPERO: I want
to give a shout out.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.718
Thank you all for being here.

00:01:08.718 --> 00:01:12.242
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:14.530
In addition, you make
a compelling case

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.072
that women are steered into
this focus of perfection.

00:01:17.072 --> 00:01:19.030
You give tons of examples
like the one you just

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.500
gave of how this manifests.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.780
I want to start with the
broadest of questions.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.650
How did we get here?

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.450
RESHMA SAUJANI:
Yeah, so I think--

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.845
what I see happens like on a
playground every single day,

00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:32.220
if you go to a
playground, you'll

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.930
see what I'm talking about.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.420
You'll see boys will crawl
to the top of the monkey bars

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.190
and just jump with their
parents like rooting them on.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.830
And with our girls, we're
like, be careful, honey.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.305
Don't swing too high.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:46.680
Oh, sweetie, your
dress is dirty.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.305
Come over here.

00:01:47.305 --> 00:01:48.570
Let me wipe it off.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.250
Did you just take that toy?

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.810
Give it back to her.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.770
So from the time that we
are like 30 months old,

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.060
we are being coddled.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.860
We are being protected.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.530
And it often starts in the
name of security, right?

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.610
I physically want to protect
my daughter from harm.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.639
And then what happens
is the older we get,

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.490
we start getting
addicted to perfection.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:14.220
And we start giving
up before we even try.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.650
Studies show that
young women in college,

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.810
when they declare
a major, if they

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.310
get a B instead of an A in
an introductory level course,

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.720
they'll drop out.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.900
Whereas boys are like, I got
a B. That's amazing, right?

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.350
And in all this perfectionism,
two things are happening.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.680
One, it's making us unhappy.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.420
Women are twice as likely
to be depressed than men--

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.310
twice as likely.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.240
And the third thing is we are
waiting to be perfect to lead.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.180
So when you look--

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.690
we celebrate all these
amazing women in Congress.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.110
But we still only have
25% women in Congress--

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.448
no new Fortune 500
female CEOs this year.

00:02:55.448 --> 00:02:57.240
Don't even get me
started about Main Street

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.150
where everywhere
you look, we are

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.170
waiting to be perfect to lead.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.100
And I think that bravery
is the antidote to that.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.970
I think bravery will
make us happier,

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.430
will make us more
joyful, and thus,

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.900
will make us more successful.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.550
JASON SPERO: There
are a lot of women

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.680
I know at Google, who I've
already recognized some

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.990
in the room, who have been
working their butts off

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.540
for a long time
and have achieved

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.430
and will continue
to achieve and grow.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.680
But I wanted to ask just
about the difference

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.990
between achievement and
striving and excellence, really,

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:29.815
but this concept you
define as being gutsy.

00:03:29.815 --> 00:03:30.690
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yeah.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.240
So Carol Dweck has
this amazing line

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.030
that like, if life were
one long grade school,

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.370
we would rule the world.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.110
But it's not.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.200
And I think that we get stuck
between this idea of being

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.910
a go-getter, which all of us
probably in this room are,

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.180
and being gutsy.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.880
Those are two very
different things.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.340
Gutsy means I'm going to
take a risk at something,

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.220
and it's probably not
going to work out.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.380
But I'm going to do it anyway.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.000
So like for me, I, my whole
life, was a go-getter.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.570
I went to the right schools,
worked at the right places.

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.400
I always, quote, "signed
up for things," but things

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.960
that I knew that I
could execute perfectly.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.680
I didn't become gutsy until
I ran for Congress at age 33

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.680
against someone who had
been there for 18 years.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.380
And I pretty much had
no chance of winning.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.230
That's when everything
changed for me.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.380
Because before that, I
thought that if I failed,

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.740
I would literally break,
that it would hurt me

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.710
so much that I wouldn't
be able to recover.

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.960
And when I failed at something
and it didn't break me,

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.480
I was like, OK, I can
live my life this way.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.778
I can continue to be
a gutsy go-getter.

00:04:43.778 --> 00:04:45.570
JASON SPERO: Could you
tell us a little bit

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.870
about your journey which
led you to run to Congress

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.537
and the things that
happened after that?

00:04:49.537 --> 00:04:52.470
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yeah, so my
parents came here as refugees.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.960
And I was like the
quintessential good Indian

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.070
girl.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.390
You know what I mean?

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.170
I did everything that
I was supposed to do.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.740
I went to the right schools.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:03.660
I got A's.

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.630
I didn't get into
cars with boys.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:06.990
All the things, right?

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.390
I didn't do those.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.830
I lived the perfect Indian girl
life, all in search of a better

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:15.330
me.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.440
A more perfect me would make
a more happier Mom and Dad.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.860
And I also thought that,
well, if I was perfect,

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.000
I would be happy and that if I
kept moving through the success

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.100
culture and getting
those accolades that it

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.290
would make me happier.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:35.910
And so I graduated $300,000
in student loan debt, right?

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.020
I thought I would work at one
of those finance law firms,

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.770
and I would pay off
that student loan debt

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:41.687
in like a year or two.

00:05:41.687 --> 00:05:43.810
And then I could do what
I really wanted to do,

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:46.560
which was run for office
and be a public servant.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:47.960
Two years turned into 10.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.350
Then I woke up at age 33 working
as a lawyer on a trading floor,

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.990
coming home every day
in the fetal position

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.870
to a very large bottle of wine.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.420
I hated my job.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.280
I remember I was
sitting there one day.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.000
And my best friend
Deepa calls me.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.750
And it's funny how
your best friend always

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.080
calls you when your life
is like falling apart.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.250
And I go into this room.

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:12.250
And I just start crying.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.020
And she just says,
Reshma, just quit.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.720
And I was like,
(WHISPERING) I can do that?

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:19.290
And I quit.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.935
I said, all right.

00:06:23.935 --> 00:06:24.810
I'm going to do this.

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.930
And I ran for Congress.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.395
I was the first Indian
American woman to run.

00:06:29.395 --> 00:06:31.770
I remember the only thing my
friends and I knew how to do

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:32.760
was build a website.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:33.510
And we built one.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.410
And we raised like $50,000
from Indian aunties

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.160
that were just so happy
an Indian girl was

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.980
running for office.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:41.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:47.040
But it was the best experience
of my life, because I was free.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.910
And I got crushed in that race.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.990
I raised like $1.4 million, and
I got like a thousand votes.

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.950
Don't do the math.

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:58.360
It was really bad.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.080
I was broke.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.110
I was humiliated.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.250
I felt ashamed.

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:03.300
People felt sorry for me.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.467
And I'm one of those people.

00:07:04.467 --> 00:07:07.390
I hate when people
feel sorry for me.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:12.630
But I was able to
recover from that.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:15.965
And drink a lot of
margaritas for like a month,

00:07:15.965 --> 00:07:18.090
ask my boyfriend who's now
my husband over and over

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:18.990
again, what happened?

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.573
What happened?

00:07:19.573 --> 00:07:20.560
What happened?

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.760
And then I was
like, OK, I'm alive.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.380
I'm ready for my next fight.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.100
And it changed my entire life.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:29.790
It's funny.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:33.690
That experience led me
to start Girls Who Code.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:36.210
And I didn't even code.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.980
Think about how crazy that was.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.680
But it was because of
the bravery of that race

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.780
and not winning it
and it not breaking me

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.300
that I thought that I could
actually start something

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.220
that I wasn't an expert on.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.590
And I think that's the power
of "Brave, Not Perfect."

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.840
That's the power of
letting go of perfectionism

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.880
and rewriting yourself and
living a life of bravery.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.900
It opens your life
up to so much.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.650
JASON SPERO: There's
a phrase in the book.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.305
You said, "I'm lost,
but I'm not broken,"

00:08:01.305 --> 00:08:03.180
which I think is that
moment of strength that

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:05.180
comes from the losing
that you're talking about.

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.790
And you use the word
resilience a lot.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:07.500
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yeah.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.910
JASON SPERO: What can
people just-- maybe

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:11.160
bring it back for a minute
to the people in this room.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.430
Where does resilience come
into play in everyday life

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.530
for people who might
be in this room today?

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:17.340
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yeah, so we all
got to throw out the parenting

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:18.030
books.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.490
I know this sounds
dramatic, but I'm serious.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:22.620
The way that many of
us have been raised

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.360
has just been wrong.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.960
So many of us, our parents
protected us, right?

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.730
So if we were bad
at soccer, they

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.400
would pull us out and
put us into gymnastics.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.570
They never wanted us to feel
fear or rejection or failure.

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:39.870
They were constantly
trying to protect us.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.140
And so we didn't know what
it was like to, basically,

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.250
be challenged.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:46.500
And many times, many of us,
when we were little girls,

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.880
we would walk away
something that

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.560
didn't come to us right away.

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:51.090
And we would walk
away thinking, oh,

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:56.350
if math isn't coming to me right
away, I must not be good at it.

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.890
And we thought that our
mindset was fixed rather

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.060
than we had a growth mindset.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:04.180
And so I think that we have
to unlearn all of that.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.990
So in the search of our parents
trying to build us confidence,

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.300
they killed our
resilience, literally

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.950
killed our resilience.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:13.410
And so many of us
find ourselves in jobs

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.790
that we feel eh about
but won't walk away.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.140
We find ourselves in
relationships, quite frankly,

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.270
that are broken.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.730
But we're too
scared to walk away.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:25.320
Many of us were
probably walking down

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.870
the street last week and
someone bumped into you.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:32.220
And you said, I'm sorry, right?

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.735
And then you went home and
you're like mad at yourself

00:09:35.735 --> 00:09:37.110
for not sticking
up for yourself.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.680
Because we don't know how.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.640
We haven't been taught.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:45.890
And it's the complete
opposite with our boys.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.100
In the quest to teach
our boys how to be men,

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.850
how to be fearless,
how to be risk takers,

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:52.850
how to be tough so they
can survive in this world,

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.190
we constantly expose
them to challenges.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.110
We constantly push
them on the edge.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.180
We constantly give
them negative feedback

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.150
over and over and over again
to build their resiliency.

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.860
And we didn't do
that for our girls,

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.160
and so we haven't learned how
to operate in a world that

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.328
does not reward perfection.

00:10:10.328 --> 00:10:12.620
JASON SPERO: So one of the
things that I tried to gauge

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.805
is the right balance of
talking about the book

00:10:14.805 --> 00:10:16.180
and talking about
Girls Who Code,

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:17.840
we'll get a chance to
come back to the book.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.757
And you can ask questions
about a lot of that.

00:10:19.757 --> 00:10:22.160
I want to pivot for a
moment and talk about--

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.950
and there's obviously
a lot of overlap.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:27.440
Tell us about the girls of
Girls Who Code to start.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.690
RESHMA SAUJANI: Oh, my god,
like how amazing they are?

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:30.580
JASON SPERO: How
amazing they are.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:30.710
RESHMA SAUJANI: How
amazing they are.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:31.220
JASON SPERO: Because
I've been in the room

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.850
for those just tiny little
snippets of this club section,

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:34.767
and there's some here.

00:10:34.767 --> 00:10:36.410
But tell us about
not these specific 10

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.820
women sitting in the front
row, but the girls of Girls

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:39.320
Who Code.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.695
RESHMA SAUJANI:
Here's the thing.

00:10:40.695 --> 00:10:44.570
I think that-- so a lot of
our girls, half our girls,

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.200
are under the poverty line.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.380
Half our girls are
black and Latina.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.410
And so it's this amazing
mix of young women.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:53.120
We live in a country
whose schools

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.390
are so segregated that
what I wanted to build

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.490
was classrooms that
look like America.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.320
Because I thought that
if we actually built

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.360
sisterhood together
that we could

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.860
build the most amazing
future products together.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.622
And what's powerful is that--

00:11:08.622 --> 00:11:10.580
so a lot of our girls
come because their mother

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:11.682
drags them.

00:11:11.682 --> 00:11:12.890
Their grandmother drags them.

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.600
Their librarian talks about it.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.600
Their parents are just
trying to get rid of them

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.290
for the summer to do something.

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.590
So they don't walk in
being like, god, I'm

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:22.730
a kick butt coder, right?

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:25.190
They actually have a
lot of insecurities

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:26.900
about their ability.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.532
And this book and
this talk really

00:11:28.532 --> 00:11:29.990
started from the
same story I would

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.392
hear about how when girls were
first learning how to code,

00:11:33.392 --> 00:11:35.600
they basically would call
their teacher over and say,

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.485
I don't know what code to write.

00:11:37.485 --> 00:11:39.110
And the teacher would
look at a screen,

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:41.790
and she'd see a
blank text editor.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.280
So if she didn't
know any better,

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.980
she thought, well, my
student spent 20 minutes just

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:48.290
staring at the screen.

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:51.050
But when she pressed
Undo a few times,

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:52.940
she saw that her
student actually wrote

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.460
code and then deleted it.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:59.240
So instead of saying, hey, look
at the progress that I made,

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:02.240
she'd rather show
her nothing at all.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:04.250
So when girls actually
learn how to code,

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.940
it's as if they've learned
a superpower that opens up

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:12.170
their entire life to doing
things that they thought

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.630
that they couldn't
do, to stopping

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:17.720
giving up before they even try.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.930
And I think that that's the
beauty and the power of coding.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.950
Girls Who Code, it's
so much more than that.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:26.540
There was this powerful
article in the "New York Times"

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.890
last week about,
how did we get here?

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.490
How did we get to a world
where we had 40% of women

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:34.190
in computer science, where we
had Ada Lovelace, ENIAC women,

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:37.940
Katherine Johnson, to
here, where we barely

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.850
can get 18% of our
workforce being female?

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.640
And don't get me started on
black and Latina numbers.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.750
How did we get there?

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:48.920
And part of how we got
there was that essentially,

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.890
in the 1980s, parents started
giving computers to boys.

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.090
And so it became something that
they tinkered, and they played,

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:56.990
took apart.

00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:59.060
And so when they came
in the classroom,

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:02.900
it was as if the boys were
coming in with an experience

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.730
that the girls didn't have.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:06.440
And then the girls
started questioning

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.350
not their ability
but their perceived

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:11.480
ability in their head.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:16.220
And they started dropping
out one by one by one by one.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:18.770
It's never about what we can do.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:20.900
It's always about
what we think we

00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:23.120
can do, that voice in
our head that tells us

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.820
that we're not good enough,
that we're not smart enough.

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:30.050
We go very quickly from,
this is hard, to, I suck.

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:31.110
I'm not smart.

00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:32.960
I've got to go do
something else.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.260
And that, to me, is the
opportunity of Girls

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:40.160
Who Code right now in that,
we've taught a lot of girls.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.800
Now I got to get you to
believe in yourself so

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:47.060
that when it starts getting
tough, because it always will,

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.280
you can stick with it.

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.030
JASON SPERO: And I
think one of the things

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:52.523
that you've taught
me is it's not just

00:13:52.523 --> 00:13:54.440
about getting someone
and getting them curious

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.210
in third, fourth, fifth grade.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.430
But that stick
with it as they go

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:01.130
based on all the social
signals in the first year CS

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:03.122
class in university
and all the things

00:14:03.122 --> 00:14:04.580
that come after
that, which I think

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.340
connects it back to a problem
we talk about a lot of Google.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.280
Which is, where is that
talent pool so that Google

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.770
can shift the gender balance?

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.270
So can you talk
just about the Girls

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:17.390
Who Code mission from the
deleting code and the "I

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:21.657
can't do this" at the micro,
but to that 15, 20 year journey?

00:14:21.657 --> 00:14:23.240
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yeah,
that's powerful.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.282
Like a story on that when
I was doing my TEDTalk,

00:14:25.282 --> 00:14:27.350
one of my friends
who's a CS teacher

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.440
was saying, when the guys are
struggling with the assignment,

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.930
they'll literally come into
office hours and be like, dude,

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:34.340
the computer's broken.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.187
The computer is broken, right?

00:14:37.187 --> 00:14:39.020
And women will come and
be like, I'm broken.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.450
There's something wrong with me.

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:45.020
And this happens all
throughout the pipeline.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:50.060
And so look, I think last year
this country graduated almost

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.670
40,000-50,000 computer
science graduates,

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.250
of which 10,000 to
12,000 were women.

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.400
We have 500,000 open jobs
in computing and technology.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:01.363
And so we got a lot
of jobs to fill.

00:15:01.363 --> 00:15:02.780
And we're living
in a moment where

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.883
40% of America's
breadwinners are women.

00:15:04.883 --> 00:15:07.550
So women are putting food on the
table, paying for the mortgage.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.920
So we've got to get
them into these jobs.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.170
Girls Who Code, by the
end of 2019, will have

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.450
reached 185,000 girls.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:17.570
Now, I'm not talking about
tinkering with a little code

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.430
and making the
sprite make a square.

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:23.990
I mean actually
teaching girls to code.

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:26.958
There is a difference
between exposure and access

00:15:26.958 --> 00:15:27.500
and teaching.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.630
And we need to get
very clear about that

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.040
as we're thinking about
how we solve the problem.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.790
So I am confident that
we have enough of you

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:37.800
amazing young women coming
through the pipeline.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.550
Now the question is, are
you going to hire them?

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:43.970
Are you going to hire them?

00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:47.630
We know that processes
are so broken.

00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:50.690
I face this as a CEO
of an organization.

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:54.660
We can't assume that our hiring
processes are equitable, fair,

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.720
and just, especially
when we've had

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.460
only one type of person come
through the hiring pipeline.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.885
We have to be intentional
about who we want to see.

00:16:04.885 --> 00:16:06.260
And so that's the
work that we're

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.390
trying to do at Girls Who Code.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:11.747
We've launched 300 College
Loops on college campuses,

00:16:11.747 --> 00:16:13.580
because the vast majority
of young women who

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:16.130
are majoring in CS on
campuses across the country

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:19.630
are ours, our Girls Who Code.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:23.770
And so now I've got to make sure
that 50% of them don't drop out

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.860
and that college universities
have as broken, sexist,

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.060
and racist structures--

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.320
I'm sure some of the
women in this room

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.653
that have gone through them
before know exactly what I'm

00:16:31.653 --> 00:16:33.770
talking about, as do companies.

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:36.220
So we have work to
do there to change

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.410
that, to change
that mentality of,

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:40.092
we're just going
to root you out.

00:16:40.092 --> 00:16:42.550
And then we need to work with
our companies who, I believe,

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:47.410
are truly committed to this
issue, to say, OK, maybe

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:50.890
we need to stop looking
at the same eight colleges

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:55.045
for the same group of women,
especially in a moment where,

00:16:55.045 --> 00:16:56.940
because of the
student loan crisis,

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:58.760
many parents are not
confident to say,

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.360
all right, sweetie, go take
$300,000 in student loan debt.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.010
It's all going to be OK.

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:04.550
Things have changed.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:06.770
And so we have to figure
out they're there.

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.510
Do we want to find them?

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:09.720
Do we want to find them?

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.220
JASON SPERO: And that's about
finding them and sourcing them

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.430
into an interview process.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.160
But you've been pretty vocal.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.560
The interview process
itself is somewhat broken,

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:19.310
something you and I've
talked about a lot.

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:21.130
And then it's something we
talk about a lot in leadership

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:21.895
at Google.

00:17:21.895 --> 00:17:23.020
Let's say they get the job.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:23.680
And they show up.

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.263
What is the experience
when they show?

00:17:25.263 --> 00:17:27.550
Again, they're fighting
existing structures every step

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:28.050
of the way.

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:30.040
So I think once you nail
your current mission,

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:34.540
I think there's this teaching
Google and our kin, our peers,

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.090
how to hire and
support these women

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:38.340
when they've landed at Google.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.048
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yeah,
little things like,

00:17:40.048 --> 00:17:41.980
don't have all-male
hiring panels.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.630
Don't have all-male
hiring panels.

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:44.670
JASON SPERO: That one
doesn't seem that tough.

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:45.270
RESHMA SAUJANI: That one
doesn't seem that tough.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.405
JASON SPERO: But
it is that tough.

00:17:46.405 --> 00:17:46.840
And we haven't changed.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.680
RESHMA SAUJANI:
But I promise you

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.180
that most of our
top companies, they

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.783
still have all-male
hiring panels.

00:17:51.783 --> 00:17:53.200
When you have two
women on a team,

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.540
don't split them up just
to make you feel better.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:56.410
Keep them together.

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.243
We like to complain and
bitch to each other.

00:17:58.243 --> 00:17:59.260
You know what I mean?

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.435
That's what we do, right?

00:18:01.435 --> 00:18:02.060
Let us do that.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:04.970
Let's build
sisterhood about this.

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:08.470
And so I think there's
certain basic things that we

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:10.510
would think are obvious by now.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:12.340
And it's a real question.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:18.490
Look, a lot of these companies
have been built without us.

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:21.350
And so they're used to
operating in a certain way.

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.860
And so while the change
is coming, when we come,

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.170
are you ready to change?

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.120
It's a real question.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.590
And it can't be
something you feel

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:34.590
like you have to do because
people are telling you to do.

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.980
You have to do it because
you really want to do it.

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.010
You've got to really want us.

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:40.880
I don't feel comfortable
telling my girls

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.370
to go to places that
they're not wanted.

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:44.660
Just don't.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.660
Because I'd much rather them
go build the next generation

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:48.370
of companies.

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:50.600
I'd much rather tell you
to go build the next Google

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.280
or Facebook, right?

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:56.750
And I think that part of what
I do feel really good about

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.270
is that 90% of our
funders of Girls

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.610
Who Code are corporations.

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:05.150
And so I'm believing
the best right now

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.400
about people's intentions.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.110
I'm just also
believing that we got

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:12.350
to work a little bit harder and
have real honest conversations

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.930
about each other, with each
other, about what's broken

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.110
and what's not.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:18.110
JASON SPERO: I had a great
conversation outside.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:19.310
And I hope I'm not
sharing too much

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:20.477
from this person who shared.

00:19:20.477 --> 00:19:22.247
We talked about
being someone who

00:19:22.247 --> 00:19:24.080
had a background in
engineering and applying

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.163
to an MBA program, the
role that her family played

00:19:26.163 --> 00:19:26.940
in supporting her.

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:29.210
So I want to broaden
off that and ask--

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:32.160
because I've seen it in the
Girls Who Code rooms how

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.230
the girls and young women
support one another--

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:35.960
can you talk about
the role of community?

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.740
And I mean that from the
clubs to the summer institute

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.690
to university, and
then as you just

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.420
said, making change from within
a bunch of these [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.425
How can women
support each other?

00:19:45.425 --> 00:19:47.633
RESHMA SAUJANI: I said I
wasn't going to bring it up.

00:19:47.633 --> 00:19:52.930
But "60 Minutes" yesterday did
a special on girls in coding.

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:56.000
And they didn't include
any women organizations

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:56.630
as part of it.

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.180
And in fact, lifted
up a man to tell

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.520
the rest of the 11 million
people watching what we need

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.685
to do with women in technology.

00:20:03.685 --> 00:20:06.060
JASON SPERO: Reshma got pretty
fired up about this today.

00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:12.470
RESHMA SAUJANI: So we knew
this was coming for a year.

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:15.080
And so for a year, we were
talking to the "60 Minutes"

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.200
producer saying,
you can't do this.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.940
For too long, women
have been written out.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.090
Our contributions
have been written out.

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:24.020
And all you have to
do is go back about,

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.760
read about Ada
Lovelace and the ENIAC

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.830
women and Katherine Johnson.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:28.580
And so they came.

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:31.280
And they filmed our girls,
this amazing Title I

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.378
school in Queens, these
young black girls of third

00:20:34.378 --> 00:20:36.920
to fifth grade that were showing
the amazing things that they

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.560
were doing about robots.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.310
And on Thursday, they
said, you know what?

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:42.100
We cut that out.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.600
I said, all right,
you want to play.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.010
We'll play.

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.800
So I wrote a Medium
post last night.

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.540
And this is the
thing about bravery.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.473
Bravery doesn't
always feel good.

00:20:51.473 --> 00:20:52.390
And I'm sitting there.

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:53.870
And I really want to throw up.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:56.440
And I was like, I have no
choice but to do what's right

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.640
and tell my truth.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:02.350
And so over the past 24
hours, it's been amazing.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:06.610
Because our community
women, our male allies,

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:09.280
have all spoken up.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:12.965
And it has been a shit storm
in like the best possible way.

00:21:12.965 --> 00:21:14.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.630
And that is the
power of community.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:19.550
That is the power of women
coming up and saying,

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:21.380
enough is enough.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.130
We won't let you write us out.

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.418
We won't, not anymore.

00:21:26.418 --> 00:21:28.210
And I think one of the
most powerful things

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:31.690
about the internet is
about the ability for us

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:33.400
to then come together
no matter where

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.390
we are to lift each other
up and to say what's right.

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:40.050
JASON SPERO: Related
to that decision

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.900
to call out "60
Minutes," can you tell me

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.640
about the difference
between "this is hard"

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.500
and "I can't do this?"

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.920
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yeah, I think
the thing is it is natural

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:54.830
to feel that something is hard
to do and then to feel like

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:55.580
that I can't.

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:59.540
Because I can't feels like
it comes from your ability.

00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:04.640
And I think, oftentimes, we
start questioning our ability.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.540
Because athletes,
like athletes often

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.390
sit on the edge of
their critical feedback

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:12.170
and their ability.

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:14.540
So there's a coach that is
sitting there and constantly

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:15.990
saying, do it again.

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.920
Do it again.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:18.040
Do it again.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.560
Oftentimes, for
us, because we've

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.960
been coddled and protected, we
haven't gotten that feedback,

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.460
right?

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:29.480
So we haven't been able to
build our muscles in the way

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.682
that we need to
build our muscles.

00:22:31.682 --> 00:22:33.140
And so I think we
immediately think

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.220
that we're either good
or bad at something.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.790
And that's not the
way that things work.

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:41.480
You have to learn how to
practice and build it up.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.127
JASON SPERO: All
right, yes, please?

00:22:43.127 --> 00:22:45.710
AUDIENCE: Hi, I was wondering
if you could go back and tell us

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:49.790
about how you ended up creating
a very successful organization

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:52.062
in something you didn't
even have experience in?

00:22:52.062 --> 00:22:54.020
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yeah, so
it's one of the things

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:58.910
actually I write about in the
book about this idea of just

00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:00.170
starting.

00:23:00.170 --> 00:23:03.630
So here I am, day after
election, I'm crushed.

00:23:03.630 --> 00:23:04.250
I'm broke.

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.150
I'm humiliated.

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:06.560
I've pissed off everybody.

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.020
Nobody's calling me
for a job, right?

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.680
I am surprised that
I'm still functioning.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.860
And it was very clear to me
that those 10 months of my life

00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:20.520
were the best 10 months of
my life and that I was happy.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:24.390
So I'm like, OK, I'm not going
back to the private sector.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.915
And I said, all right, of
all the things that I saw,

00:23:27.915 --> 00:23:29.540
where's the place
that I actually think

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.100
that I can make a difference?

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.500
And I kept thinking
about those classrooms

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:37.640
that I would walk into where
I wouldn't see any girls.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.380
And I don't know about you guys.

00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.800
But I always have a job
and then a night hustle,

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:46.010
like the thing that I'm
working on on the side.

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:48.860
And I'm a lawyer, so
I love to research.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.347
So I started just looking at
why are there not women in tech?

00:23:52.347 --> 00:23:53.180
Where are the girls?

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:54.650
What are the programs?

00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:58.820
And I would spend my lunch
hours and my nights meeting

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.490
with people, principals
who taught computer science

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:03.950
classrooms, PhDs who
were trying to understand

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:06.800
this problem, people
who ran nonprofits.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.810
And so two years
in, I was like, OK,

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:13.650
I think I have an
idea about a solution.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:15.800
And I was like, I'm a
little bit of a marketer.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.967
So I'm like, oh, Girls Who
Code, that's a cool name.

00:24:17.967 --> 00:24:19.340
Let me see if it's on GoDaddy.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.360
It was there.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:21.590
I bought it for like $1.99.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:23.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.210
Sometimes when we have ideas,
we don't tell people about them

00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:31.647
because we think
they're not perfect yet.

00:24:31.647 --> 00:24:32.480
So I didn't do that.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.590
So when I would meet
people, they'd be like,

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:34.130
what are you working on?

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:36.130
I'm like, well, I got
this idea, Girls Who Code.

00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:37.370
And they're like, oh.

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:40.390
My first funder was
actually Google.

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:41.250
It was my friend.

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:41.430
JASON SPERO: I didn't know that.

00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:43.555
RESHMA SAUJANI: I don't
even know if you knew this.

00:24:43.555 --> 00:24:45.710
It was this guy,
Alex [? Abelin, ?]

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.910
who was running community
affairs at Google in New York.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.590
And he had this budget
where he could actually

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:57.470
give $10,000, $20,000 to
different organizations.

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.430
So we were at a conference.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:00.630
And I was talking to him.

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:02.210
And he's like, oh,
my god, I love it.

00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:04.685
He actually just
sent me the note.

00:25:04.685 --> 00:25:05.810
And he said, you know what?

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:08.270
I think I can find
$10,000 for you.

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:10.490
I'm like, oh, my god, you can?

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:13.050
And so he invested in me.

00:25:13.050 --> 00:25:14.690
And then I was like,
oh, I got Google.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:16.742
So I can do this.

00:25:16.742 --> 00:25:17.700
And then I got Twitter.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:20.480
And then all these
little pieces of dollars

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:25.010
were legitimacy, legitimacy
of this idea that was simply

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:26.820
just an idea in my head.

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:30.890
And then I just went too
far that I couldn't quit.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:33.890
And I had to just
do one program.

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:35.345
And here we are.

00:25:35.345 --> 00:25:37.970
JASON SPERO: You have said that
the perfection cycle is getting

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:38.898
worse .

00:25:38.898 --> 00:25:41.315
Can you talk about the role
of social media in perfection?

00:25:41.315 --> 00:25:42.770
RESHMA SAUJANI: Oh,
my god, like five

00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:45.350
minutes scrolling on Instagram
and your anxiety peaks, right?

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.640
It hasn't helped.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.190
I mean, most of us
will take 500 selfies

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:54.020
to take that perfect
selfie, right?

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.160
And you'll take one.

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:55.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:00.710
It's like social
media exacerbates

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:01.980
the perfectionism in me.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:05.270
And then we also think
that all these people,

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:07.052
why am I not happy?

00:26:07.052 --> 00:26:08.510
Look at all these
other people that

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:09.920
are living these perfect lives.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.780
And what's wrong with mine?

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:13.500
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.080
So outside of Google,
I do a lot of work

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.913
with helping high school
students understand

00:26:16.913 --> 00:26:18.150
what personal development is.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.640
And so I was just wondering
if you can go back

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.723
to high school, what do
you wish that you invested

00:26:21.723 --> 00:26:23.335
in yourself more?

00:26:23.335 --> 00:26:25.085
RESHMA SAUJANI: Ah,
what a great question.

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:32.640
I wish that I had learned this
whole brave not perfect thing

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.140
more.

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.160
One of the things I
talk about in the book

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.220
is this idea of doing
something you suck at.

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:44.420
So every man I know does
something he sucks at--

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:50.870
golf, tennis,
fantasy, basketball.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:52.615
President Obama
sucks at basketball

00:26:52.615 --> 00:26:53.990
and plays it all
the time, right?

00:26:53.990 --> 00:26:57.980
It's like they can do
things that they are not

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.150
good at but they love.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:01.640
We don't have that.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.250
Most of us will not even
go to a Soul Cycle class

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.050
till we're "fit," right?

00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:07.910
The point of going
to an exercise class

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:10.130
is to get fit, right?

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:12.920
And so I have
started, at 40, doing

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.040
things that I'm not
good at but that I like.

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.640
I love this Savasana
thing at yoga.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.050
I can't do a headstand,
barely can do a Child's Pose.

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:22.550
And I wouldn't go
to yoga because I

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:24.800
was too embarrassed, right?

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.720
Now I do things that I
like, but I'm not good at.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.450
I wish I did that
when I was younger.

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:31.280
I missed out.

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:37.730
I loved gymnastics, but I
couldn't do a cartwheel.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:38.930
And I still remember that.

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.230
I can still feel that feeling
of being in my gymnastics class

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:45.590
and feeling like a jerk
because I couldn't do anything

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.260
and just wanting to
run out of the room.

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.080
And I wish that I had
just stayed with things

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.410
that I was mediocre at that I
enjoyed and knew what it felt

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:57.620
like, knew what it feels like
to be Barack Obama playing

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.240
basketball.

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.337
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:28:00.337 --> 00:28:01.670
JASON SPERO: One of the things--

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:03.570
I want to stay with the
questions from the crowd.

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:05.570
But one of the things
that struck me is you also

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:08.510
point out that while it's great
to have a Beyonce or a Venus

00:28:08.510 --> 00:28:10.920
Williams or Serena
Williams or whatever it is,

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:13.010
that's also an impossible
standard as well.

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:13.580
RESHMA SAUJANI: Totally.

00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:14.372
JASON SPERO: Right?

00:28:14.372 --> 00:28:16.403
So when you go out
to do the cartwheel,

00:28:16.403 --> 00:28:17.570
you shouldn't be aiming to--

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:19.903
RESHMA SAUJANI: No, you should
be aiming to be mediocre.

00:28:19.903 --> 00:28:21.630
You should be just aiming to--

00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:24.005
we need more feeling like what
it's like to be mediocre--

00:28:24.005 --> 00:28:25.922
JASON SPERO: The story
of my life, by the way.

00:28:25.922 --> 00:28:28.580
RESHMA SAUJANI: --not what it's
like to feel excellent, I mean,

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:30.500
not excellent, but like A plus.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.980
AUDIENCE: But they also
started not being good, right?

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:33.280
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yeah.

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.290
AUDIENCE: Like Serena
Williams probably sucked.

00:28:35.290 --> 00:28:35.540
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yeah.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.790
JASON SPERO: I'm going to
repeat just because somebody

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:38.660
is watching on video.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.700
She said, all the people
that you could name that

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.075
are exceptional,
I think, and you

00:28:42.075 --> 00:28:43.867
said Serena Williams
started being mediocre

00:28:43.867 --> 00:28:46.033
and built their way up
through work and all of that.

00:28:46.033 --> 00:28:48.590
RESHMA SAUJANI: It's that
idea of 10,000 hours, right?

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:50.660
If you put enough
time into something,

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:55.080
you can do it "well."

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:55.998
JASON SPERO: Please.

00:28:55.998 --> 00:28:56.540
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:57.850
My name is Ishra.

00:28:57.850 --> 00:28:59.990
I am very fortunate to
be a middle school club

00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:02.960
facilitator and the
club's success specialist

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.903
for the organization.

00:29:03.903 --> 00:29:04.820
RESHMA SAUJANI: Great.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:05.570
Thank you so much.

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:08.150
AUDIENCE: Thank you for all
that Girls Who Code does

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:10.290
and thank you for today's talk.

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:14.150
My question for you is,
can you share your vision

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:16.830
for the clubs for
the next five years?

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:19.060
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yeah, world
domination, basically.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:22.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:25.457
One of the things
that frustrates me--

00:29:25.457 --> 00:29:27.290
and we have a report
coming out about this--

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:30.830
is that it's sometimes
said that things

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:32.070
are going great in school.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:33.830
And that's just not true.

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:35.283
You walk into any
computer science

00:29:35.283 --> 00:29:36.950
classroom in the
country, and it's still

00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:39.500
80% boys and 20% girls.

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:42.140
And so we use the
clubs as a vehicle

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.900
to get girls interested so
that they will then go sign up.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:49.370
So when you look at the APCS
numbers going up, that's us.

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:50.760
That's us, right?

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.150
And I will take credit for it.

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:54.380
Because it's us.

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.750
And a lot of it is
because of the clubs.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.450
Because what happens is that
girls get exposed to it,

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:02.780
and they're like, oh, this
is fun making a robot dance

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:04.150
and building this.

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:05.400
It's not as hard as I thought.

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.192
And they bring their
friends, and then they

00:30:07.192 --> 00:30:10.370
go sign up for CS class or APCS.

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:13.790
And so I would just like to
grow and grow and grow and grow

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:14.835
and grow.

00:30:14.835 --> 00:30:16.460
The other thing that
I've been thinking

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.790
a lot about is that my
goal this year-- we're

00:30:19.790 --> 00:30:22.130
launching international-- is
to start teaching Girls Who

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:24.410
Code clubs at refugee camps.

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:26.460
Because we forget that
half of the country,

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.370
they don't have computers.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:30.657
And that as automation is
changing everything about

00:30:30.657 --> 00:30:32.990
the way that we live and work,
we cannot leave half this

00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:34.460
country behind.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:38.240
One of the reasons why
we have so much division

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.710
is because far
too many Americans

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:41.120
feel like their
kids are actually

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.910
not going to have the same
chance that they've had.

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:45.740
And if we don't
get them exposure

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:48.710
to computational
thinking and computer

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:51.043
science as early
as we possibly can,

00:30:51.043 --> 00:30:52.460
they are going to
get left behind.

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:55.430
And we're going to actually have
more division in our country.

00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:57.890
So we always like to start
with our clubs, what's

00:30:57.890 --> 00:30:59.270
the hardest to reach places?

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:02.670
Where's the poorest
places in our country?

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:04.760
I want to go there.

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.580
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you so much.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:07.773
JASON SPERO: Thank you.

00:31:07.773 --> 00:31:10.190
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I just
wanted to hear a little bit more

00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:13.520
from you about when you talked
on throwing away the existing

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.520
parenting books and how
I can shift my mindset--

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.437
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yeah,
so much pressure, right?

00:31:17.437 --> 00:31:20.840
AUDIENCE: --in raising her
to be different than maybe

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:22.050
what I was raised as.

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:22.940
RESHMA SAUJANI:
Yeah, look, I think

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.898
that one of the things
that we have to remember

00:31:24.898 --> 00:31:26.900
is that we're not with
them all the time.

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.400
And there's so many
different people

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:32.480
that they're exposed to
that immediately, culture

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.180
plays a huge role in how
we think boys should behave

00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:37.230
and how we think
girls should behave.

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:41.330
So I think the important thing
early on is to let them--

00:31:41.330 --> 00:31:44.060
it sounds simple, but
let her get dirty.

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:46.070
Stop every bone
in your body when

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:50.450
you see a booger in her
nose to go get a napkin

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:52.940
or when her hair
looks like a mess.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.430
And the thing is, we think
it's a reflection of us.

00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:58.090
But it's not.

00:31:58.090 --> 00:31:59.798
My son looks like a
pig pen all the time,

00:31:59.798 --> 00:32:02.007
and I don't think it's a
reflection of me-- at least,

00:32:02.007 --> 00:32:02.810
I tell myself that.

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:04.932
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:04.932 --> 00:32:08.690
So let her get physically
messy and also let

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:11.900
her get physically hurt.

00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.840
You want to see her with
tons of scabs on her knees.

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:16.280
And for her to not--

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.387
for you to not--

00:32:17.387 --> 00:32:18.470
because I feel like it's--

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:20.095
I was hanging out a
friend this weekend

00:32:20.095 --> 00:32:22.811
who has a twin boy and girl.

00:32:22.811 --> 00:32:25.100
And the girl hurt her--

00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.320
her daughter, Jade, is
actually quite bigger

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.940
than her son, Tusk.

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:30.230
And we're both reading a book.

00:32:30.230 --> 00:32:32.870
And they're both
fighting, play fighting.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:35.160
And she immediately was
like, Tusky, be careful.

00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.550
Don't knock your sister over.

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:37.747
I was like, his sister?

00:32:37.747 --> 00:32:39.830
She's knocking him over,
and she's twice his size.

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:40.997
But you see what I'm saying.

00:32:40.997 --> 00:32:44.600
It is our instinct to go
towards physical protection

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.470
of our girls.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.533
Try not to do that.

00:32:47.533 --> 00:32:48.950
JASON SPERO: I
would add something

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:51.432
you and I have talked
about is, maybe not at two,

00:32:51.432 --> 00:32:53.640
but make them aware of how
much the world around them

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.242
is going to send
them signals as well.

00:32:55.242 --> 00:32:56.950
They're going to get
it from their media.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:58.700
They're going get it,
in my family's case,

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.200
from their third
grade math teacher.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.825
They're going to get
it from everywhere

00:33:01.825 --> 00:33:02.830
that you can't control.

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:05.540
But if can recognize it,
it's so powerful thing

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.253
maybe to call it out
that someone else is

00:33:07.253 --> 00:33:08.420
trying to put them in a box.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.300
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yep.

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:12.880
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:17.990
I've been pretty fortunate where
I've had advantages in life.

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:21.580
And one of the challenges that
I face now is that, at times,

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.490
the men around me
get very insecure.

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:31.120
And so have you thought
about maybe cultivating

00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:37.240
that security in boys growing
up so that they don't feel

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.310
like they always have
to be the manly man

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:42.340
and be the sole provider
and stuff like that?

00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:44.920
RESHMA SAUJANI: They feel
insecure because why?

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.770
Because your talent,
your ability,

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:51.220
or because they feel
like-- what do you mean?

00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:53.560
AUDIENCE: So at times,
I've encountered

00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:57.640
men who can't cope with
having a female manager.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.920
RESHMA SAUJANI: So I
feel like that is about--

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.540
so those are two
different things.

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.910
So I think that, when
I think about this,

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:07.450
so I want my son, who is very
like a little mini Gandhi

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:10.540
to feel like he
can be vulnerable.

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:11.409
And he's sweet.

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:14.550
And he's not that tough
rumble guy, right?

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:17.050
And I don't want people to keep
trying to tell him that he's

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:18.550
got to be somebody else.

00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:20.860
I do pray on a daily
basis that he does not

00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:21.854
become Brett Kavanaugh.

00:34:21.854 --> 00:34:23.979
And that is the thing that
I think is an obligation

00:34:23.979 --> 00:34:26.159
as a-- right--

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.030
is like I got to make sure.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:30.400
And so he has constantly
surrounded by women.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.870
But the second thing you're
talking about is, I think,

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:34.550
very important.

00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:38.320
Which is this conversation
about women in tech,

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.750
it's ultimately about power.

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:44.690
We are talking about a
distribution of power.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:46.449
And we have to be
honest about the fact

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:50.199
that that is not going to
make men feel comfortable.

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:52.270
And also we have
been raised to always

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:59.020
think about prioritizing
men's feelings, right?

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:02.650
And because we've been raised
to be toxic people pleasers,

00:35:02.650 --> 00:35:04.210
we have to unlearn that.

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:06.790
So one, we have to stop
caring what they think

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:07.870
and how they feel--

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:10.190
period, full stop, done.

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:12.400
Doesn't matter, right?

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.070
And that is a constant thing.

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:17.200
Because we want to be liked.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.700
And then the second
thing is I think

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.190
we have to have a real honest
conversation about power,

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:21.857
and we have to activate
our male allies.

00:35:21.857 --> 00:35:23.950
One of the best things
that happened last year

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:25.630
was that I was speaking
at the Rochester

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:27.440
Institute of Technology.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:33.400
RIT had gone from 13%
female to 33% female.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.740
And so I'm speaking at the
Women in Computing group.

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:39.230
And there's these three dudes
that are sitting in the back.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:40.638
And I'm like, who are you?

00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:42.430
And they're like, we're
the men who support

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:44.140
the Women in Computing group.

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:45.325
They had formed a club.

00:35:45.325 --> 00:35:46.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:49.360
They had literally
formed a club.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.760
And it was amazing.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:57.933
And their job was to help
support women to be more brave

00:35:57.933 --> 00:35:59.600
or when were
microaggressions were made,

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.240
they would say something.

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:05.398
Or sometimes their job
was to just shut up.

00:36:05.398 --> 00:36:07.690
You talk about this in our
boardroom oftentimes, right?

00:36:07.690 --> 00:36:11.240
It's like men talk 70%
of the time in meetings.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:14.560
We can't be brave if
they keep talking, right?

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.960
So part of it, though,
is being able to have

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.590
an honest conversation
with men about this.

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:24.790
So when your leadership
has been questioned,

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:28.240
as I'm sure it has been,
you probably go home,

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.260
and you're just mad.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.360
I need you to confront.

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.520
I need you to confront.

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:37.290
And I need us to have the honest
conversations that we simply

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:40.350
need to have with men, and we
have to come from the place

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:42.578
that I think that they
want to do better.

00:36:42.578 --> 00:36:44.120
And I'm going to
keep believing that.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:47.120
I'm going to keep believing that
they are my Rochester Institute

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.040
club and that they
want to do better.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.970
And even though post-MeToo
courage has been contagious

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:57.020
for women, we can't assume that
it's been contagious for men.

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.870
We can't assume that they know
what to say and what to do

00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:02.960
and that they're often not
coming from an authentic place,

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.300
which is being able to say
whatever they want to say,

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:08.900
because no one has told
them that they can't.

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:12.200
And so I think it's
an opportunity for us.

00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:13.880
AUDIENCE: My question
is not perfect.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:14.590
RESHMA SAUJANI: I love it.

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:15.548
AUDIENCE: But I'll try.

00:37:15.548 --> 00:37:19.700
So I want to hear a little bit
about fighting the existing

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:21.200
structure.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.920
As you said, it's really hard.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.080
Existing companies have
been built without us.

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:31.130
So even like we are at Google.

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:33.690
It's supposed to be
the better ones, right?

00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:35.350
But when you look
at the leadership

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:38.030
and when you're sitting in the
meeting room, a lot of times,

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:40.670
it's majority male still.

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:44.060
And I think that
women, they experience

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:47.060
explicit, implicit
[INAUDIBLE] as well as

00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.830
just the self-doubt as well.

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:53.450
So even at Google,
I've seen women

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:55.430
leaving the workforce
because of this,

00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:59.570
or they change teams that
are supposedly better,

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:03.110
or they leave to
another company.

00:38:03.110 --> 00:38:06.680
Or they just stay
to fight, right?

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:10.260
So what should we-- what
is, in your opinion,

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:13.520
what is the best kind
of survival defense

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:18.080
mechanism for us in
the existing structure?

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:19.810
And also, at what expense?

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:23.142
So in order for us to
stay here and fight, not

00:38:23.142 --> 00:38:24.350
like at Google specifically--

00:38:24.350 --> 00:38:26.060
RESHMA SAUJANI:
It can be Google.

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:28.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
stay here and fight,

00:38:28.370 --> 00:38:33.720
but also we need to think about
our mental health as well.

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.590
So yeah, what is
the right balance?

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:39.030
RESHMA SAUJANI: So first of
all, I think we have to--

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:41.280
Google's not perfect.

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.910
Google's not perfect.

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:44.220
No company is.

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:45.720
Google may be
trying really hard,

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:47.342
and that's awesome, right?

00:38:47.342 --> 00:38:48.550
But we still have work to do.

00:38:48.550 --> 00:38:50.050
And I think we got
to get to a place

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:52.170
where we can stay and
fight and also acknowledge

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:55.920
the change that needs to happen
and that be OK and not feel

00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:00.540
threatened by that or not
feel your personal success

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:04.350
is going to be compromised
if you speak truth to power.

00:39:04.350 --> 00:39:07.950
And so that's why, to
me, this book is about,

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:11.100
how do we build our
everyday courage?

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.020
You're seeing six women
running for president,

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:16.140
all these men basically
taken down by MeToo.

00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:20.410
But still, things happen
to us on a daily basis

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:23.847
that diminish our courage.

00:39:23.847 --> 00:39:25.680
And so we can't speak
out at the big moments

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.430
because we don't even
know how to stand up

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:28.920
for ourselves anymore.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.420
So we have to start
working on that,

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:32.970
because we have
to stay and fight.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:36.300
So I think the first thing
is, how do we practice

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:38.370
building our bravery muscle?

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:41.950
How does every time a
microaggression or something

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:45.870
is said in my workplace or
at home or on the street, I

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:48.240
actually speak up for myself?

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.850
And we get into the
practice of doing that.

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:53.610
I think the second thing is
is we can only stay and fight

00:39:53.610 --> 00:39:56.050
if we have sisterhood
with each other.

00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:57.750
How do we support each other?

00:39:57.750 --> 00:39:59.760
Every single one of
you that's a manager

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.010
should be promoting
someone who is a woman.

00:40:02.010 --> 00:40:03.480
You should, period.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:07.030
And you shouldn't
feel bad about that.

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.190
Because the only way we
change the power structures

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:11.557
is if we lift each other up.

00:40:11.557 --> 00:40:13.390
You can't have someone
open the door for you

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:15.970
and then you kick
it on the way in.

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:17.740
And so part of it
is understanding

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:20.600
why do we not have
sisterhood with each other.

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.140
And I think a lot of that
has to come from the fact

00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:27.730
that so many of us have
things that we wanted to do,

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:29.770
whether it was start
a company, go here,

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:31.930
maybe not have a
baby, whatever it is.

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:33.670
And you talked
yourself out of it.

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:35.830
Or someone else
talked you out of it.

00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:39.310
And then you see someone
else doing the very thing

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:41.630
that you wanted to do.

00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:46.140
And you're left with
regret and envy.

00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:47.980
So we have to go
to that place where

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:50.940
our envy is and acknowledge
our deepest dreams.

00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:53.250
And then we can
lift each other up.

00:40:53.250 --> 00:40:55.530
The third thing is
is I really think

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:58.410
that we have to start having
these honest conversations

00:40:58.410 --> 00:41:01.140
with our male allies.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.490
So many men I know--

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:05.085
again, I've been in a room
where a rape joke was made

00:41:05.085 --> 00:41:06.960
or something was said
that was inappropriate.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.940
And maybe they laughed
or didn't say anything.

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:10.690
And then they went
home, and they're like,

00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:13.650
I can't believe that was said.

00:41:13.650 --> 00:41:16.020
They have to be brave too.

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:18.000
It can't just be on us.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.210
It can't just be on
us to change things.

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:26.330
But if we want to make things
different, you've got to fight.

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:27.120
And guess what?

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.060
It doesn't always feel good.

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.462
It doesn't always feel good.

00:41:30.462 --> 00:41:32.420
But it has to happen,
because it's the only way

00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.447
that-- nothing will change.

00:41:34.447 --> 00:41:35.280
Nothing will change.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:39.830
And I say that as
someone who is a lawyer.

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:42.590
My law school class
was 50-50% women.

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:44.930
30 years later or
20 years later,

00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:46.730
I can go to any law
firm in this country,

00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:49.430
and it's still 80%
men and 20% women.

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:51.680
Nothing's changed, because
people don't give up power.

00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:54.170
You have to take it.

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:56.600
And you have to ask yourself,
are you ready and willing

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.748
to take it?

00:41:58.748 --> 00:42:01.206
JASON SPERO: Oh, hello, on the
livestream, what do you got?

00:42:01.206 --> 00:42:02.720
AUDIENCE: Oh, hi.

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:06.415
I actually think that the last
couple offered some feedback.

00:42:06.415 --> 00:42:08.040
JASON SPERO: Yeah,
we're getting it to.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:08.790
But fight through.

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:11.055
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:11.055 --> 00:42:15.900
AUDIENCE: OK, well,
it's imperfect, yes.

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.250
I've been fighting a long time.

00:42:17.250 --> 00:42:20.820
And it actually is
really, really hard

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:23.850
to build alliances with other
women for exactly the things

00:42:23.850 --> 00:42:25.320
that you just mentioned.

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:31.950
I see the envy of most
of my best managers

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:33.520
with the exception
of two people.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.940
And I've been a long-term
contractor in Silicon Valley.

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:39.480
Most of my best
managers have been men.

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:44.820
OK, so I think that's
really unfortunate.

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.830
And I'm of an older generation.

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:48.570
I wasn't in the
coddled generation.

00:42:48.570 --> 00:42:51.480
And my son was not coddled
because I was a single mother.

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:53.020
So all the things about--

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:54.800
and also, I was a
[INAUDIBLE] kid.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.275
And my mother was
[INAUDIBLE] family.

00:42:57.275 --> 00:43:02.240
And I grew up with knees
that have scabs on them

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:03.510
and all of those things.

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:06.060
And so I've been
extremely brave.

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:08.880
And I just have to say
I really want support

00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:12.750
from more women,
women in technology.

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:16.210
I still have a whole lot to do.

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:19.800
And I think that what
it is I have a whole lot

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.370
to offer as a mentor.

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:24.840
But also I need support
from my younger sisters.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:26.790
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yeah,
that's so powerful.

00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:27.990
You know what?

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:30.420
We just got to keep
working on it, right?

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:31.740
Because so much of this--

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:33.690
I think about my mother.

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:36.720
My mother was always
like, you're too fat.

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.470
Stand up straight.

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:39.262
Really, you're going
to apply for that job?

00:43:39.262 --> 00:43:40.800
You're not going to get that.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.320
Whereas my father was
like, you can be anything.

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.700
You can be everything.

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.670
And most of us have
mothers like this.

00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:51.330
And it's often because it's
that same perfectionism passed

00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:52.260
over and over.

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:54.420
Same dreams deferred, right?

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:57.120
They didn't do the things
that they wanted to do.

00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:58.860
They were constantly criticized.

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:01.920
And then we pass it on, and we
pass it on, and we pass it on.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.930
Whereas, oftentimes,
our fathers were

00:44:03.930 --> 00:44:08.440
allowed to be brave and
have flaws and thrive.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.800
And so they encouraged
us to do the same.

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:12.780
So we got to break the cycle.

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.800
We got to break the cycle.

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.810
And I think once you
start acknowledging it,

00:44:18.810 --> 00:44:19.900
it can change.

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:20.650
I always say this.

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:24.560
I ran for office twice,
and I lost twice.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:27.120
But I can celebrate
with my whole heart.

00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:29.080
AOC and I took the stage
last Friday together.

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:34.380
And it was like, it was felt
so much joy in watching her,

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:37.410
because at least I tried.

00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:39.420
Whereas if I had
never tried before,

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.450
I would not be able
to even watch CNN.

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:44.440
It would hurt too much.

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:47.040
So I think if everybody in
this room goes to the place

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.040
for your envy is,
where your regret is,

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.190
and whatever that is, you
start working on that.

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:56.280
Even if you take one
step, I think your heart

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:57.990
will open up to other women.

00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:59.460
I really believe that.

00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:02.850
You will become more
generous, because you can.

00:45:02.850 --> 00:45:05.583
Because there's nothing there
that you're not trying to do.

00:45:05.583 --> 00:45:07.000
JASON SPERO: Just
before you go, I

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.375
want to tell the
person who asked

00:45:08.375 --> 00:45:10.188
the question on the
livestream thank you.

00:45:10.188 --> 00:45:11.230
And also that there was--

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:11.820
you can't see them.

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:12.360
They're not on cameras.

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.245
There was a lot of
nodding in the room--

00:45:13.245 --> 00:45:14.320
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yeah,
thank you for that truth--

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:15.350
JASON SPERO: --when you
asked that question.

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:17.178
RESHMA SAUJANI:
--because that's so real.

00:45:17.178 --> 00:45:18.720
AUDIENCE: How do
you discern between,

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:22.140
"I am not enjoying this
because I'm not perfect at it,"

00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:23.700
and "I am not enjoying it?"

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.257
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:25.257 --> 00:45:27.590
RESHMA SAUJANI: I think you
got to do it a couple times.

00:45:27.590 --> 00:45:29.350
You got to do it
a couple of times

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:33.420
to start getting rid of that
thing of like-- because we tell

00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:36.300
ourselves I'm not enjoying
this because I don't like it.

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:38.147
But really, it's because
I'm not good at it.

00:45:38.147 --> 00:45:40.230
AUDIENCE: So how do you
think about the threshold,

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:41.405
just like a few times?

00:45:41.405 --> 00:45:42.780
Or I went through
a coding class,

00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:44.030
and I passed it, gosh darn it.

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:45.165
But I still hate coding.

00:45:45.165 --> 00:45:46.632
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:46.632 --> 00:45:48.840
RESHMA SAUJANI: But did you
have joy from completion?

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.260
AUDIENCE: No.

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:49.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.830
I just thought, holy
cow, I'm so glad

00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:55.170
I never have to take
this class again.

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:56.472
And I never want to be a coder.

00:45:56.472 --> 00:45:57.930
I want to work in
tech, but I'm not

00:45:57.930 --> 00:45:59.050
going to sit in front
of a computer all day.

00:45:59.050 --> 00:45:59.162
RESHMA SAUJANI: Fair.

00:45:59.162 --> 00:46:00.450
Then you passed the test.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:01.200
Then you passed the test.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.330
It has nothing to do with--

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:04.830
AUDIENCE: It took a long time,
but I think I knew beforehand

00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:05.080
that I wasn't in to it.

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:06.622
RESHMA SAUJANI:
Well, so I would say.

00:46:06.622 --> 00:46:09.630
In this book, I say it's
like the drama wisdom test.

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:10.608
That's why I call it.

00:46:10.608 --> 00:46:12.900
OK, so is this your drama
talking where you're saying I

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.000
don't like something because you
really just are not good at it?

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.530
But it's your
wisdom, which you've

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:20.040
gained from actually trying
it and given it yourself.

00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.882
And you were like,
I don't like this.

00:46:21.882 --> 00:46:22.840
AUDIENCE: Cool, thanks.

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.632
RESHMA SAUJANI: It's
how I feel about golf.

00:46:24.632 --> 00:46:26.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:29.688
JASON SPERO: It's also how I
feel about golf, by the way.

00:46:29.688 --> 00:46:30.230
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:31.855
So first, I just want
to say I'm really

00:46:31.855 --> 00:46:33.680
grateful that we got
to come here and meet

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.700
you and everything.

00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:37.610
And my question is,
so basically, I'm

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:39.280
one of the founders
for the Girls

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.910
Who Code club at our school.

00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:42.800
And we have a process
where we basically

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:45.710
have to present in front
of the student council.

00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:47.630
And they pass our club.

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:50.822
So we actually had
to go three times.

00:46:50.822 --> 00:46:52.280
And the third time
is when our club

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:54.470
got passed, which
seems like not a lot,

00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:55.595
but that's really uncommon.

00:46:55.595 --> 00:46:56.540
RESHMA SAUJANI:
No, that's crazy.

00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:58.790
AUDIENCE: People usually get
passed in the first time,

00:46:58.790 --> 00:47:00.530
or they just don't.

00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:01.670
But yeah, we kept going.

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:05.882
But a lot of the criticism we
faced was by girls in the room.

00:47:05.882 --> 00:47:07.340
When they asked
us, they were like,

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.278
why do you need
a Girls Who Code?

00:47:09.278 --> 00:47:10.820
Why can't it just
be People Who Code?

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:12.482
Because we don't
have a Boys Who Code,

00:47:12.482 --> 00:47:13.940
so why do we need
a Girls Who Code?

00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:14.840
RESHMA SAUJANI: And it's
the girls saying it?

00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:16.128
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:47:16.128 --> 00:47:17.670
It was actually a
girl from, I think,

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:20.210
a comp Sci club, another
comp sci club, saying that.

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:22.200
But we faced a lot of backlash.

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.270
And I just want to know.

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:25.440
You probably have
to since the start.

00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:26.690
And how do you deal with that?

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:28.370
RESHMA SAUJANI:
Yeah, listen, I think

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:31.420
it's internalized patriarchy.

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:32.870
It is, right?

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:35.510
We oftentimes-- I was just
having this conversation

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:37.190
with a woman last week.

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:38.600
And she was like, well--

00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:41.540
she was a senior woman in tech
at a very senior company who

00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:43.300
has a son, which I do too.

00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:44.780
And she said, I just think we--

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:48.140
what about the boys?

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:49.940
What about the boys?

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:51.380
What about the boys?

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.090
It's as if we're living in a--

00:47:53.090 --> 00:47:56.460
we can talk about the boys when
we're at 70, and they're at 30.

00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:58.590
And then I'll start
Boys Who Code, right?

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:00.640
But we're not even close.

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:02.840
We're not even
touching the surface.

00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:04.790
I think that's
internalized patriarchy.

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:07.850
I think we're so
raised to be thinking

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:10.970
about them and their feelings.

00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:13.370
And I think we so still--

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:16.520
I still remember middle
school teenage freshmen who

00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:20.240
wanted to be liked by the boys.

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:22.340
We want them to accept us.

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:25.340
And so in certain ways
by wanting them to accept

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:26.930
us means that we
have to deny things

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:30.290
that are beneficial to us.

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:32.700
We need to have
these conversations.

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:34.200
We need to have
these conversations.

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.840
I'm obviously a
political junkie,

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:41.990
but it drives me nuts,
nuts, that so many women

00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:43.340
voted for him.

00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:46.070
And that yet again,
they will do it again--

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:50.820
except black women,
except black women.

00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:54.460
And what is that about?

00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:57.230
But we don't have these
conversations as women.

00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:59.690
And we have to.

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:00.630
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:02.050
JASON SPERO: Thank you.

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:03.050
AUDIENCE: All right, hi.

00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:04.500
I'm from the same club.

00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:07.550
And so as a high school
student, obviously, you

00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:09.945
need drive to keep
going forward.

00:49:09.945 --> 00:49:10.820
I was just wondering.

00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:14.060
How do you find motivation
on day-to-day basis

00:49:14.060 --> 00:49:16.910
to take your foundation
to the next level

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:19.618
to do something no
one's ever done before?

00:49:19.618 --> 00:49:21.410
Where do you find the
pride and motivation?

00:49:21.410 --> 00:49:24.560
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yeah, listen,
I feel like we say in Hinduism.

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:25.400
What's your dharma?

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.680
What are you put on
this earth to do?

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:30.087
And I've always had
a very strong sense--

00:49:30.087 --> 00:49:31.670
I know this is going
to sound cheesy--

00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:35.340
but I love this country.

00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:38.660
I love this country.

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:42.200
And I want to do what is best.

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:46.140
And I also know my parents came
here as refugees with nothing.

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:47.300
I've been a dog walker.

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:51.950
I've worked at Baskin-Robbins,
retail, telemarketer.

00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:55.310
And I see far too
many of my students

00:49:55.310 --> 00:49:59.900
that are just being left behind,
who have like one meal a day

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:01.918
and will go from Oakland
to Facebook or Google

00:50:01.918 --> 00:50:03.710
to learn how to code
because they just want

00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:06.360
a shot at the American dream.

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:10.670
And I think that I and
we have an opportunity

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:12.840
to make things
different for them.

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.590
And so I wake up every
day thinking about them

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:20.630
and about like that I feel so
blessed that I, in my lifetime,

00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:23.746
can make one
person's life better.

00:50:23.746 --> 00:50:27.050
AUDIENCE: All right, thank you.

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:28.380
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Sonia.

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:30.260
I'm also from the same club.

00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.390
So this is really amazing.

00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:34.200
I didn't think that
this would be possible.

00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:40.400
But as a high school student,
I find it really difficult

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:44.300
to be motivated to
jump at opportunities

00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:48.090
which I'd be scared I'd fail
at and take these risks.

00:50:48.090 --> 00:50:53.600
So what inspires you
to wake up one day

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:59.120
and make the transformation
from go-getter to gutsy?

00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:01.880
RESHMA SAUJANI: I just
don't want to be--

00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:03.060
and I say this.

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:03.560
I'm 43.

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:04.060
I know.

00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:05.300
Why am I outing myself?

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:05.840
But I will.

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:06.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:12.790
So I see a lot of women in my
life that are just unhappy,

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:16.720
and they didn't do the things
that they wanted to do.

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:18.670
And they're bitter.

00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:20.715
And I don't want to be that.

00:51:20.715 --> 00:51:22.090
I don't want to
be sitting there.

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:23.923
That's why I make myself,
once a year, think

00:51:23.923 --> 00:51:25.480
about running for office again.

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:27.700
Just to check myself, right?

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.500
Because I don't want
to be sitting there

00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:34.060
and regret a life never lived.

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.190
And that's what also gets me up.

00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:37.510
I also feel like--

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:40.120
I think sometimes,
for many of us,

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:42.520
I don't know if I know
what I like anymore

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:44.980
or whether I've told myself
that I don't like something

00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:46.990
because I wasn't good at it.

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:48.660
And I don't want to miss out.

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:53.020
I have a husband who lives life
to his fullest, as Jason knows.

00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:56.110
And he lives his
life that way, right?

00:51:56.110 --> 00:51:58.540
And I see how much
joy it brings him.

00:51:58.540 --> 00:51:59.740
You don't see guys like--

00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:01.660
this isn't a management book.

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:04.090
Don't read this book if
you want a promotion.

00:52:04.090 --> 00:52:06.580
Read this book if
you want to be happy,

00:52:06.580 --> 00:52:08.590
if you want to be
joyful, if you want

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:11.530
to live your life with
the full gusto of the way

00:52:11.530 --> 00:52:13.520
we should live our lives.

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.250
And that's what I want.

00:52:15.250 --> 00:52:18.110
And that's what I want for
each and every one of you.

00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:21.310
And I think when we do that,
all these leadership numbers,

00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:23.318
all this stuff of like
taking the world over--

00:52:23.318 --> 00:52:24.610
because I want to do that too--

00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:26.200
that's all going to come.

00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:29.185
Because we're going to come
at it from a different spirit.

00:52:29.185 --> 00:52:30.060
AUDIENCE: Hey, there.

00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:30.680
I'm Eva.

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.972
I'm an engineer here at Google.

00:52:31.972 --> 00:52:34.377
Thanks a lot for coming
out to speak with us.

00:52:34.377 --> 00:52:35.210
I've got a question.

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:39.020
So what advice do you have for
those of us who are in industry

00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:43.490
and would really like to make
a connection with the younger

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:46.420
generation of girls that
want to get into coding, that

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:49.770
want to establish friendships,
mentorships, things like that?

00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:51.800
There is a typical
check the website thing.

00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:54.050
But just kind of beyond that,
do you have any thoughts

00:52:54.050 --> 00:52:55.008
on how to get involved?

00:52:55.008 --> 00:52:57.830
RESHMA SAUJANI: You should be
giving back every single day.

00:52:57.830 --> 00:52:59.690
And you should judge
yourself for that.

00:52:59.690 --> 00:53:01.550
You really should, seriously.

00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:03.330
And I actually think that--

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:04.880
I mean, I don't
know you, but I'm

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:07.220
sure you have an
incredible story.

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:10.250
And so much for them, they just
want to hear how you did it.

00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:11.150
Like, what did you--

00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:13.190
what are the doubts that
you had in your head?

00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:15.352
What's the knowledge
that you shared?

00:53:15.352 --> 00:53:16.310
You have to understand.

00:53:16.310 --> 00:53:20.120
So much of, I think, power
and success, as I've realized,

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:22.343
is knowledge sharing.

00:53:22.343 --> 00:53:25.010
Even if you told them, hey, when
you go into a Google interview,

00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:26.450
this is what to expect.

00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:28.160
This is what they're
going to ask you.

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:30.313
These are the tricks
and trades, right?

00:53:30.313 --> 00:53:31.730
This is the things
that I doubted.

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:33.530
Don't do this, or do this.

00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:35.757
Sharing knowledge,
you have knowledge.

00:53:35.757 --> 00:53:37.340
All of us in this
room have knowledge.

00:53:37.340 --> 00:53:38.420
You got here.

00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:39.530
You got here.

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:42.290
This is one of the hardest
companies in the world

00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:44.540
to get through,
and you got here.

00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:47.390
Share that secret
sauce with all of them

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:48.930
and the thousands of others.

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:50.120
Because that's what men do.

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:52.250
They are constantly
sharing information.

00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:55.055
We hold our stuff tight, right?

00:53:55.055 --> 00:53:56.930
We hold ourselves back
because half the time,

00:53:56.930 --> 00:54:00.680
we don't even think
we belong here, right?

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:03.740
We don't even think
we belong here.

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:05.898
So we don't share our knowledge.

00:54:05.898 --> 00:54:06.940
And we say, I don't know.

00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:08.340
I was just lucky.

00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:11.160
Ah, somebody let me in.

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:12.950
But you got here.

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:14.710
So share your knowledge.

00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:15.310
Share it.

00:54:15.310 --> 00:54:18.155
Share it far and wide.

00:54:18.155 --> 00:54:18.863
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:54:18.863 --> 00:54:20.300
JASON SPERO: We've got two more.

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:21.880
Thank you for hanging
in, everybody.

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:22.940
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Simone.

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:27.110
And I, like yourself, changed
my career just recently.

00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:31.100
And I just want to know if
you have any advice for me

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:34.560
that I am starting again?

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.200
I'm not going to do doubt again.

00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:39.500
I'm not in high school anymore.

00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:42.710
So do you have any advice
on how can I go about

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:46.670
to learn and grow in technology
without getting myself

00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:47.680
in too much debt?

00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:50.180
RESHMA SAUJANI: Without getting
yourself into too much debt?

00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:51.032
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:51.032 --> 00:54:52.490
RESHMA SAUJANI:
Part of it is just,

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:55.820
I think, continuing
to try things

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:57.103
and to not doubt yourself.

00:54:57.103 --> 00:54:58.020
So how does that work?

00:54:58.020 --> 00:54:59.603
So one of the things
we didn't get to,

00:54:59.603 --> 00:55:01.100
I want to get to
real quick is, how

00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:04.197
do you build a bravery mindset?

00:55:04.197 --> 00:55:05.030
We're in California.

00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:06.950
Y'all spend a lot of
time drinking green juice

00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:09.990
and thinking about what
to do with your bodies.

00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:12.740
Let's talk about your mind,
because I think it's just

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:16.030
important to practice our mind.

00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:17.683
And meditation is one practice.

00:55:17.683 --> 00:55:19.100
I've built another
practice, which

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:20.810
I think is really important.

00:55:20.810 --> 00:55:23.655
And that's why you don't
have to take another class

00:55:23.655 --> 00:55:24.530
and do another thing.

00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:26.738
Because we always think we
have to take another class

00:55:26.738 --> 00:55:28.520
to get another skill to-- no.

00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:29.720
Don't take anymore classes.

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:31.670
You're good enough as you are.

00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:35.500
You are good enough as you are.

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:38.740
But we have to start
practicing things

00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:40.940
to get us on the bravery side.

00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:44.600
So the first thing is, is you
can't be brave if you're tired.

00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.460
You can't be brave
if you're tired.

00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:47.570
You got to sleep more.

00:55:47.570 --> 00:55:48.770
You got to meditate.

00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:50.010
You got to get to the gym.

00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:52.670
And you got to stop putting off
those doctor's appointments.

00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:54.850
You've got to take
care of yourself.

00:55:54.850 --> 00:55:58.000
Oftentimes as women, we
put everybody else first,

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.660
and we put ourselves last.

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:02.275
And we have to take
care of ourselves.

00:56:02.275 --> 00:56:04.150
Second thing, I think
that's really important

00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:07.478
is to practice imperfection,
whatever that means for you.

00:56:07.478 --> 00:56:09.520
For a lot of women, I say
to them, you know what?

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:12.250
Send an email with
a typo in it--

00:56:12.250 --> 00:56:15.340
no emojis, no
explanation points.

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:18.460
Just say what you want
to say and press Send.

00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:20.540
And if it's got a
typo in it, who cares?

00:56:20.540 --> 00:56:21.465
Nobody cares.

00:56:21.465 --> 00:56:22.840
They're too focused
on themselves

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:25.870
to focus on you and
your email, right?

00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:28.060
So part of that is
just get whatever

00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:30.483
imperfection means for you.

00:56:30.483 --> 00:56:31.900
It might mean
store-bought cookies

00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:33.660
at your kid's birthday party.

00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:36.160
Maybe not in California, but I
was going to say in New York,

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.827
it might mean going
to the grocery store

00:56:37.827 --> 00:56:39.820
without a full face
of make up on, right?

00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:43.210
Whatever that means for
you, practice imperfection.

00:56:43.210 --> 00:56:47.650
I think the third
thing is just start.

00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:49.970
And that means identifying,
what's your [INAUDIBLE]??

00:56:49.970 --> 00:56:52.880
What's the thing that
you are the scaredest of,

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:54.520
the thing at night
you think about

00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:56.470
and just, ah, it scares me?

00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:58.010
I can't do that.

00:56:58.010 --> 00:56:58.510
Start.

00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:00.190
Take one step towards that.

00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:04.420
For me at Girls Who Code,
it was buying the URL.

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:06.392
For some people, it
might be if you're

00:57:06.392 --> 00:57:08.350
thinking about your
fitness, it might mean just

00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:09.467
going for a walk tonight.

00:57:09.467 --> 00:57:11.050
Or if you're looking
an apartment that

00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:12.280
needs to be clean, one shelf.

00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:15.850
Whatever it is, just start.

00:57:15.850 --> 00:57:16.820
Take one step.

00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:18.070
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:18.070 --> 00:57:19.240
I'm software
engineering at Google.

00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:20.865
Thank you very much
for the talk today.

00:57:20.865 --> 00:57:22.718
I just wanted to ask about--

00:57:22.718 --> 00:57:24.010
do you have any advice for men?

00:57:24.010 --> 00:57:25.860
How can men help?

00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:26.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:28.453
RESHMA SAUJANI: Thank
you for that question.

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:32.140
I always say.

00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:34.480
It's never been a better
time to be a woman.

00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:36.760
And I feel that way so
much because there's

00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:42.340
men like Jason and Nahal and
you and extraordinary men

00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:44.280
in our space right now.

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:47.950
40% of Girls Who Code's
teachers are men.

00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:50.890
Half of my board is male.

00:57:50.890 --> 00:57:54.040
And I think, how do
we get to a place

00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:58.160
where we can really
activate our male allies?

00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.790
And I think, like I just
said, I do think part of it

00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:02.950
is start a club.

00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:06.430
Literally start a club,
because none of this

00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:09.370
really changes until women
become 30% of the technology

00:58:09.370 --> 00:58:09.940
workforce.

00:58:09.940 --> 00:58:11.460
And we've got some ways to go.

00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:13.210
So in the end, it's
going to be up to you.

00:58:13.210 --> 00:58:15.850
We can't always stand
up and fight the fight.

00:58:15.850 --> 00:58:19.120
Sometimes we need you
to fight the fight

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:21.310
and to do what's right
and to create the world

00:58:21.310 --> 00:58:24.320
that we want you to create.

00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:29.800
And so if Google does still
have all-male hiring panels,

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:32.830
I would love for you to
say something about that.

00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:34.360
I would love for
you to be the one

00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:36.370
to advocate for the company.

00:58:36.370 --> 00:58:40.460
You're spending more resources
on teaching girls how to code.

00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:43.180
I would love for you
to commit, every time

00:58:43.180 --> 00:58:46.870
you hear a microaggression
said or something that's

00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:49.170
very blatant, for
you to be like,

00:58:49.170 --> 00:58:52.940
hey, that's not right,
and not always rely

00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:54.410
on us to be the ones.

00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:56.210
Because it's exhausting.

00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:57.400
Isn't it, ladies?

00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:00.480
It is exhausting.

00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:03.660
And so if you can stand up
arm-in-arm in solidarity

00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:07.440
with us to create the world that
I think you want to build too,

00:59:07.440 --> 00:59:10.922
I think we'll solve this
problem much faster.

00:59:10.922 --> 00:59:11.880
JASON SPERO: All right.

00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:12.560
RESHMA SAUJANI: Thank you.

00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:13.230
JASON SPERO: Thank
you for the question.

00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:13.813
I'm going to--

00:59:13.813 --> 00:59:17.620
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:21.788
In an hour of sound
bites, thank you so much.

00:59:21.788 --> 00:59:22.580
I want to tell you.

00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:25.310
I read the book as a
father of daughters.

00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:29.307
I read the book as a manager
who wants to be better

00:59:29.307 --> 00:59:30.890
and I hope as a bit
of a change agent.

00:59:30.890 --> 00:59:32.516
And it helped me on
all of those fronts.

00:59:32.516 --> 00:59:32.750
RESHMA SAUJANI: Thank you.

00:59:32.750 --> 00:59:34.350
JASON SPERO: I want to
thank you for being here.

00:59:34.350 --> 00:59:36.590
My favorite chapter is called
"Brave is the New Black."

00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:37.850
Please join me in
thanking Reshma.

00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:39.183
RESHMA SAUJANI: Thank you, guys.

00:59:39.183 --> 00:59:42.570
[APPLAUSE]
