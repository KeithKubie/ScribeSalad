breeders of course I knew about this

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800

they knew it was important but they

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820
they knew it was important but they
 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.130
they knew it was important but they
didn't know how to make use of it

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140
didn't know how to make use of it
 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.740
didn't know how to make use of it
because they got inconsistent results

know conservative water use because now

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369

we call it the plant water conservation

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960

wilting it they will impact yield and it

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270
wilting it they will impact yield and it
 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.629
wilting it they will impact yield and it
says part of the reason why you know um

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:36.639
says part of the reason why you know um
 

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:39.270
says part of the reason why you know um
under it you get these variable results

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280
under it you get these variable results
 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.609
under it you get these variable results
because the you know using water more

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619
because the you know using water more
 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.379
because the you know using water more
slowly means you're getting in co2 more

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:43.389
slowly means you're getting in co2 more
 

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:45.899
slowly means you're getting in co2 more
slowly you're growing more slowly and so

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909
slowly you're growing more slowly and so
 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.309
slowly you're growing more slowly and so
that's one reason in the second reason

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319
that's one reason in the second reason
 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.399
that's one reason in the second reason
is that drought is many things it

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409
is that drought is many things it
 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.050
is that drought is many things it
manifests in many ways depending on the

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060
manifests in many ways depending on the
 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.999
manifests in many ways depending on the
developmental stage and when it occurred

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009
developmental stage and when it occurred
 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.440
developmental stage and when it occurred
so you know this is what these

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450
so you know this is what these
 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.179
so you know this is what these
experiments look like this is from our

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.099

thinking about the agricultural
footprint and yields under other

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830
footprint and yields under other
 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.040
footprint and yields under other
situations we find that this sort of

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050
situations we find that this sort of
 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.520
situations we find that this sort of
throttling back has some some value and

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530
throttling back has some some value and
 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:47.899
throttling back has some some value and
you can see that under you know under

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:47.909
you can see that under you know under
 

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:49.850
you can see that under you know under
some circumstances you get to lower

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860
some circumstances you get to lower
 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.469
some circumstances you get to lower
yield under certain rainfall you'll get

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479
yield under certain rainfall you'll get
 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:53.540
yield under certain rainfall you'll get
lower yield with this trait but if you

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550
lower yield with this trait but if you
 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:55.909
lower yield with this trait but if you
average over you know the the range of

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919
average over you know the the range of
 

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:57.260
average over you know the the range of
conditions that in a farmer's going to

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270
conditions that in a farmer's going to
 

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.510
conditions that in a farmer's going to
face this can be very helpful so all in

00:06:59.510 --> 00:06:59.520
face this can be very helpful so all in
 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.729
face this can be very helpful so all in
there
