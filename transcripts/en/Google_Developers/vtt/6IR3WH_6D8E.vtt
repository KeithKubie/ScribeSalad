HENA HAINES: Hi.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.652
I'm Hena Haines, and I'm here
from the Google Mountain View

00:00:07.652 --> 00:00:08.637
headquarters.

00:00:08.637 --> 00:00:12.135
And we just made it to Milwaukee
to meet with Harley-Davidson

00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:15.200
to see how they're using
the Maps API to help

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.750
riders plan their rides.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.320
MALE SPEAKER: The
technology that's

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.200
coming in now if we're
on the bikes, it's great.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.033
It really helps out.

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:23.450
It gets your turns
ahead of time.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.158
It keeps you away from
the four wheelers.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.137
It does a great job.

00:00:26.137 --> 00:00:28.220
HEIDI SKINNER: We love our
partnership with Google

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.310
simply because it's a
really familiar platform

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.080
that all customers use
on a day-to-day basis.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.240
And we want to use technology
and great innovative partners

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.850
to help our riders experience
the ride and adventure.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.440
The Ride Planner application
does a lot for our customers,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.310
and Google Places
and Google Maps

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.270
layered on top of that really
make it all come together.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.170
MALE SPEAKER: There's
something about getting

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.490
from A to B on a motorcycle.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.340
Especially for me,
a Harley-Davidson,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.421
there's nothing else.

00:00:56.421 --> 00:00:57.670
I look at it as a partnership.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.729
I tell it what I
want to do, and I

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:01.020
know it's going to get me home.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.750
That's a great feature
about all of that.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.250
HEIDI SKINNER: We've
got riders that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.840
need directions
around the block,

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.900
and we've got riders
that take trips

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.360
of 10,000 or 20,000 miles,
and Google makes it so easy

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.810
for them to plan a ride.
