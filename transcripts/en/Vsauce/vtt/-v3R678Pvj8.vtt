Vsauce! Michael here,
and I am back from vacation.

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:06.220
You may not have known,
but I just spent the last week in Hawaii

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.700
with my mother and my sister.
She's the one hiding right

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.130
there. I worked on my tan, grew my beard back out,
and most importantly

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.400
I learned a lot and I wanted to share
some of that knowledge with you today.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.619
In fact, on Saturday, I'm gonna release
a brand new

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.100
Vsauce Leanback, made out of videos from
producers all over YouTube

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.470
that I was inspired to watch after
learning things in Hawaii.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.050
It's going to be exciting, but today,
right now, let's get started and begin

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.820
with Pearl Harbor. In 1941 more than 300
Japanese fighters attacked

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.550
the US naval base at Pearl Harbor.
The USS Arizona was one of the many

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.750
battleships damaged

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.820
or sunk and the Arizona was left

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.280
right where it sank. It's still there and
a memorial has been built right on top

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.719
of it.

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:54.329
From the memorial you can see something
pretty surprising.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.030
The ship is still leaking fuel.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.379
It once held more than a million gallons
of fuel and so

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.200
even today, 70 years later,
it continues to leak five gallons of gas

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.830
every day into the ocean. In fact, you can
actually smell it from the memorial.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.570
The Navy hasn't fixed it yet because the
leak is seen as a constant reminder

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.920
of what happened and as tears that have continued to flow

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.250
ever since the day of the attack.
Pearl Harbor also has this giant map,

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.299
which shows you something else I was
excited about being close to -

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.400
the International Date Line.
It's an arbitrary line where the new day

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.049
begins. You see, when the Sun rises in the
morning for these Pacific Islands,

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.369
different days are beginning.
In Samoa

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:42.829
it might be 9 in the morning on
Thursday, but just a few hundred miles

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:43.560
away,

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.990
across the dateline,
it's 9 in the morning on

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.130
Friday. One day in the future. This means
that some pretty weird things can happen.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.720
For instance,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.909
Amelia Earhart disappeared without a trace

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.420
while traveling from New Guinea to Howland Island.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.299
She was talking, communicating and most definitely live

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.790
on July 3rd.
But then she crossed the dateline

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.920
and disappeared forever on July 2nd.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.430
At the Dole Plantation you can take a train

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.580
called the Pineapple Express and see
coffee being grown.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.790
Or you can visit Kona and toast the
camera with coffee

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.950
made from beans right below you.
If you prefer softer beans, grab a shaved ice

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.489
from Matsumoto

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.590
with red beans at the bottom.
Or

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.170
eat some shrimp so fresh that they were
grown in ponds

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.739
right behind the shrimp shack.
This is the hospital Barack Obama was born in

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.030
and the top of Diamond Head,
a volcanic tuff cone in Honolulu,

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.810
has a great view of the city, but it's so
windy that all around the steep sides

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.690
are clumps

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.910
of lost hats.
By the way,

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.980
the camera I've been using entire time
says it's waterproof

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.370
and to find out if it is, I'm gonna send my
sister down. Good luck.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.860
Finally, Mauna Kea, the highest point in Hawaii

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.909
and, if measured from its seafloor base, a mountain

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:25.000
taller than Mount Everest. It's above the
clouds, so driving up is really freaky.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.680
You literally drive into and through the cloud line.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.879
The dry air, high-altitude, and comair make it perfect

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.599
for observing space. I didn't get to use
those telescopes, but people had smaller

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.470
ones I could use

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.750
pointed right at Saturn.
I tried to get camera footage of it and this

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.690
is the best I could do.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.280
To learn more about Saturn

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.019
and Hawaii's volcanic activity and a
whole host of other issues, be sure to

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:52.459
watch

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.290
our Leanback coming out this Saturday.
It's an autoplaying playlist

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.239
that I host full of video clips from
producers all over YouTube, so they get

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:01.909
the views

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.180
and if you like what they make,
you can subscribe to them. Stay tuned for that.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.580
And as always,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.940
thanks for watching.
