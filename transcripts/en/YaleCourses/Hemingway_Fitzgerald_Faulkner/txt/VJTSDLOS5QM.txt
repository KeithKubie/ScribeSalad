Speaker 1:          00:14          Um, about the film, um, those of you who were there, we realized that, um, the film is very, very different. Uh, um, on the book, um, uh, is, is great. Uh, uh, Brit rating on the quote of five, in fact, as, uh, the, uh, many clever transformations, as long as they pull it out, the lawyer, he lives in denial, uh, becomes the occasion for low joke about the eat and, uh, how [inaudible] thing you really, uh, the carry about half full steam. That job there was repeated throughout there. Really. Uh, so it's a very clever transformation to see a movie on your own just to swing later. Um, Faulkner is, um, is actually very impressive to know that he could write something like this arm if you're read. Uh, but he can also rate the screenplay for the half and half, not five. So He's, you know, just kind of a, almost two sides of his background in terms of rating.

Speaker 1:          01:31          Uh, so this is just the, just to alert you to, um, this, the, the existence of the film. Um, but I also wanted to use this as an occasion to talk about a remark that, uh, Howard Hughes at Howard passed, um, made about, uh, devote that to half and half not, and, um, in many ways, adding insult to injury there was completely changing the plot line of the novel. Uh, but he also had some generous things to stay, uh, about the novel and about Hemingway. So, uh, because it was working with having way and having a, it was on record as being quite unhappy with the way that his novel, uh, was transformed. So how the last claim to have clear from having way, um, they had to have and have not a with junk and tally, that was the excuse for his completely changing the novel arrive. It started out being really took nothing silly, um, should have the freedom to, uh, change, uh, as he saw fit, which he did a two or a staggering degree.

Speaker 1:          02:47          But however else we made in the tradition of people saying negative things about to happen and help nurse, um, and uh, we can look at a few other instances are people expressing a lot tells about the novel. Um, this is, um, one of the most extreme down wash was to have and have not is stupid and foolish, both a disgrace to a good radar, a boat which should never have been printed. It contains passages of golden writing and the pause of three good show stories when one of these was up here and ask why as the short story. It was much better there and not broken up by the, in the concision of the chapter. Um, so you know, about as as hostile a review as one could get a auto. I should also say that, but we've used our Jamera in themselves and I often book reviewers feel the need to be critical so itself is completely within their convention.

Speaker 1:          04:00          Um, a book reviewing. Um, here's another, uh, to my mind much more, uh, much as the Muslims, more perceptive of, um, and much truer to the spirit of, uh, to have an half, not from a great critic, Alpha Kaizen in new having way, not altogether. They have passages and passages in which the old ac ruins comes through with the slippery rhythm, the virtual assonance, that awful ways of phases fused with sessions before he is cleverness that the click clack of the bead is like a hits. And also unusual awkwardness for this is a Hemingway who is rather less sure of himself than usual and a good deal more into hence. So this to my mind catches very well, uh, both with his good about the novel and what makes it worth reading in my mind. Uh, we'll also obviously points to some really clear the facts about the novel is also a very good pressurization of Hemingway in terms of I see really means, um, and the, the [inaudible] and uh, having weighs pros that makes it almost like poetry at many moments are.

Speaker 1:          05:24          So it's just a very good overall calendar pending where, uh, but also the special, uh, tig and, um, I think very true to the spirit of Hemingway and thinking that it's both less well crafted, uh, but maybe closer to Hemingway's hot, one more quote from another critic. And very understandable given the subject matter of uh, to half and half, not saying that Hemingway was one of the least of work whenever co writers in this generation, I think it's very interesting statement. He was one of the least overtly political. Does that mean that even though he's not overtly political, um, that actually, uh, there's a time of deep politics in the novel. So I would like to not over, but something that once we look deeper, further into the novel or get to see that there's some hard experience. Um, so I would like to take that as a starting point, um, and to ask whether or not to have and have not is a political now.

Speaker 1:          06:33          Um, and as is the custom in this class, I like to think about it, um, on a number of, on two different scales. One is through the macro history, uh, that is the background to a novel. Um, and we know that because Harry Morgan, there's so much to do with Cubans were tied to get to United States in part one, and then Cubans wanted to get act of Anna and par three. Uh, we know that Q and markets is very much there. Um, and along with that and Paolo of that, that is also the Great Depression in the United States that this is very much a novel of the 1930s. These are the macro context, um, that make up the context of the novel. Um, and moving to a somewhat different scale and the scale of character, um, character and narrative technique. Um, I like to think about a novel as a different permutations of half and half now.

Speaker 1:          07:35          So that sense is really the theme and variations on a title itself. Um, and I'll be talking about Harry, um, as a half, not in several ways, linking that to the macro history of the novel. Uh, but then what I really would like to make a case for in the rest of the lecture is Harry as a special, kind of have what I would call a mediated kind of have that is he becomes, even though he's so obviously have not, he becomes a half true, the presence of somebody else. So this is what I mean by mediated has through the presence of another person. Either it could be Marie or it could be some suddenly like Richard Gordon. Um, Harry gets to become a habit. So this is the argument about Harry not being a half on his own, but becoming a, have by virtue of either a handling process by way of Norwegian and is channeled through the reef of because of the weight she, about him.

Speaker 1:          08:56          And also because of the way he looks at her. And he contrasted with visual and both because of the way Richard looks at Emory because of the way which have gotten hot stoves on wife Helen. So, um, is there much a permutation or kind of, uh, a dance really among characters? Um, in order for Herrick to emerge as half of the very app. So first of all, let's go back to the macro history of Cuba in the 1930s. Um, and as you can see, um, the colleagues with Cuba was incredibly complicated in the 30s. Um, there were six presidents in three years. Um, so I'm not even, you are under no obligation to remember the names of the residents. Um, I will even an announcement where there's one of, they give you a sense of how long they were presidents. Um, so most of the residents were residents for just a few months.

Speaker 1:          09:53          This days, less than a month, um, less than just a few months. Um, in the case of Ramon Grau, um, just for three days, um, in the case of others via, um, and this is this beat every name. He was president for just one day when you're okay. Sterling. Um, and then, okay, slightly longer, uh, a few months as a record and, uh, a few months. So, um, I think that it's just really clear, you know, just from looking at the list of presidents of Cuba, um, in the [inaudible] 33 and then the, with the sex, um, that the politics was just incredibly hard to figure out. Um, and as I mentioned last time, having way was actually knocking cure when he was waiting to happen. I was in The Bahamas. So it's highly improbable that he would have been able to figure out the pilots of Cuba in, in any intimate way. Um, he would have been looking at it very much from the outside.

Speaker 1:          11:02          He probably understood the politics of the status who wore a that he was covering much, much better than the actual politics can kill it dead setting. Um, so instead of feeling us out, so that as a consequence, the president of Cuba, whenever never mentioned, we all even know who was president. Um, then, um, instead of what Hemingway feels us is the generic type. This is the young boy, Emilio, um, who was one of them passengers. They have to be carried back to Havana after the bank robbery. And so, um, the very dangerous trip for Harry. Um, but he gets to talk to the boy. Quite a Ben on also kills him. Uh, but this is a generic type Revolutionary Moffa his speech pattern. We are the only true revolutionary quality deploys that we want to do away with all the Ohio patients with all of American imperialism.

Speaker 1:          12:07          This trend goes as the tyranny of the army. We want to start clean and give every manage hands. We want to add this way every other go heroes. You know, it hasn't, we just raised money now by double his head. To do that we have to use means that they never use. Also we have to use paypal. We will not employed later but ends with the means. Emilio is in any way. Uh, but he talked like a much older person. There's actually a lot of authority and I don't think that Hemingway's just giving this to us as the caricature, that's a certain kind of authority that comes from the sermon for Cabo are certain speech pattern. The boiler was, didn't have to think in order to say all those things because he's so familiar with that kind of phrasing and kind of idiom. Um, he's considered conditioned in that idiom.

Speaker 1:          13:11          Um, so that it really is second nature to him and we can think a little bit about what it means to have that kind of second nature. I think that most of us tend to think that it is not good to have that kind of language real into our, so there's almost a kind of brief last action clear to come out. Just like that. I think we tend to be very suspicious of people who talk in this kind of, um, very dogmatic and a generic kind of language. Um, you know, that were, you can, you can hear two sentences and you know, it was man is a radical and is wearing his medical and some only asleep. Um, so this is a man who, um, in many ways he, we don't even know if his true name is Emilio. Um, he just says to Harry, you can call me from Jojo who's going back to that famous line in Raleigh.

Speaker 1:          14:07          They call me Ishmael. Many, many characters in American literature would say save another character, hobby something. This is a very, very minor local innocence of this, but we all know his true name. He's just known by name Millie. Um, and that in itself is emblematic of the kind of character that he is. Um, but I want to go back to the point about what it means to have a second nature. The second linguistic Asia. Um, and even though our instinct, our gut reaction is to be very suspicious of someone like that. I actually want to make the point that having a second nature like that, it's probably not the worst thing a human being can have. You know, it is probably not the best thing a human being can have, but if Holly is not the worst thing, um, because if is a sort of religious faith, um, that is gas in Sephora language and to the extent that we've named that human beings need some kind of fair, it actually is very, very good to have that second nature.

Speaker 1:          15:23          So I, you know, I think they've done anyways, politely caricature in that style. But you're showing us what it means to have with being within that kind of language isn't problematic. Kind of being, most of us would be Jacqueline, but it is kind of a Bible kind of being as in contrast, we can look at Harry and this is the first instance when I would like to make the case for Harry as a have not, is that it just doesn't have that kind of political conviction. He doesn't have the stake and the Azure that is second nature to neo and as a consequence, as public talks, I want to trend. Harry was thinking, what the hell do I care about? Is Revolution at Worker's revolution to have a working man who rast the band and kills a fellow, works for them and then kills that who are them hours and never did any harm as a working man, he kills you.

Speaker 1:          16:26          Never things about with the family is the Cubans run fever. They are double cross each other. They sell each other that they get what they deserve. The hell of the revolutions I got to do is make a living for my family and I can do that. Then he tells me about his revolution to hell with his revolution. Um, is the reaction of Holly knows who us, we'll have, uh, you know, the Cubans, especially in the 30s a that sort of revolution with feel that way to most people who are outside of it. But the point remains that feeling that way about the revolution gifts, Harry, no alternative moral grounding. This speech is almost leave me and of any kind of moral confusion, any conflict or conviction, um, I can say is I want to drink at this moment. Um, and um, that, you know, I want to make a living with my family and I can do that.

Speaker 1:          17:37          So it is almost a kind of a toto mission of this feed without having the dubious saving ways of some sort of local conviction that can one, two sons with excellent this horrible condition that you are in. Um, um, nausea that familiar represents a superior alternative to Harriet. Quite the hydrating is diluted. Um, you know, having waves, not leaving a lot of bell about that ability is diluted, but as some point in one's life, a certain degree of growth of illusion, it's actually very necessarily fiction there. Um, loss of human beings need and um, is probably about for the oil to die, still clinging to that political conviction. Um, and this is what happens to Harry where he cannot claim when there's really nothing for him to claim too. Um, when he's relying completely on his own mental resources and this not all of him, he's pretty empty person left to his own devices.

Speaker 1:          18:52          Um, so this is, I would argue that this is the first instance of Harry as a half, not only in the sense that he doesn't have that do yours but redeeming kind of stagnation. Um, I, we also know that the Cuban Revolution's such as they were, um, without the only reference point for the novel, um, fair to have and have nice, very much about key west key west during the great depression. This is Hemingway's house house in key west that he spent a lot of time in later, actually much, much later. Not at this point. Um, but this would have been what people in key west with seeing, uh, during the great depression, the rent minds. Um, and this is one that was actually or Fargo historical archives, um, most likely key west, um, because keywords, which is very profitable recently before the Great Depression, and this especially hardly hit by the depression.

Speaker 1:          19:55          So the unemployment rate was 80%, 80% of the citizens were actually on leap and you see the hours who was on the week. So, um, this is about the most acute case study after the Great Depression that we get in American literature, except that having ways, not really talking about the Great Depression in the frontal way. Um, and we can look at the way in which even the word Greg depression without giving them the great [inaudible] is a suggested to us. But that is that historical context. Um, so this is how the great depression is register by Harry other bruises. Boat Harry had the last sack over. Give me the first night, he said to the neighbor is gone, Harry depressed the self starters and started the two engines. He put his second engine in her, he went back to running. They occur whether the depression had put charter boat fishing. Um, so this at is two ways in which Harry as a smother of their color.

Speaker 1:          21:12          Two ways in which that gets potentialize. First we don't know about is we all can only conjecture and hard to um, Harry is both reviewed who us as his mother, but uh, we just think that maybe that's just suddenly he chooses to do, but then it comes out in the context of the Great Depression that he goes back to it because the, your passion has made the much more profitable Charterhouse charter boat fishing. Um, in hospital in part one, he was still doing the, to go fishing when he was cheated out of inner and play $5 on is to dance. That was still the title fishing. Uh, that is no longer operative and the only way he could make a living as by smuggling records to me, United States. So, right then that is the way that this very old league, um, very elusive way as the way Hemingway in the axes.

Speaker 1:          22:21          Um, the Great Depression. And I think there is really useful to think of the technique that Hemingway is using as a kind of, in that sense it's not a front or a food trends description of the great depression is just, um, a kind of very ACAB equal appearance that puts the depression in the index, so to speak of the novel. Uh, but it's, it doesn't engage in or put it into format. Um, and we can, I hope that you guys were talking about it in session, why chooses not bar the depression in that way? And it's very ugly passion. Uh, but in this passage we can also see that Harry is a half not, um, for these three reasons. One is that he's lost his original occupational, although there's also the reference who's going back to having, they go to, so, you know, he must've been doing that as well.

Speaker 1:          23:19          We all know why it was going at. All we know is that he had been law abiding for quite a while as a owner of a child vote. Um, and now has been something that is illegal because of the Great Depression. So he loses his legal occupation. Um, right now we know also know that he's losing naturally all this liquor because he's so the cousins are, uh, on him, so he has to get rid of eyes that has a lot of money. Uh, but not only that, even as more detail about this fish even that is gone. And so in many ways to have and have now is a very detail from the macro to the micro, have a lot of odd things that are being taken away from hairy. Um, it really is it in injury when he was in a big way, laws and loosen the group as well as within the landscape of laws there anyway has created for Harry Morgan and um, just one other, um, watering of him as the have not, and this is Harry thinking about, he knows that those Cubans, that one, the Cubans who want to get back to Havana, he knows that they're going to rob a bank because every time you lost, then he doesn't want to look at the bank.

Speaker 1:          24:47          So he actually knows that that's what's going to happen. Uh, so gullible as now to know the purpose of that trip. Um, but he is not in a position to make any other choices at that point. So I was here. This is the ultimate measure of hairy as have not, is knowing that he should not be doing this or having no other choice open to him either stay here now and I'll be all of them, but what the hell are they? Where's the money coming from to keep Maria and the girls have got no boat, no cash. I've got no education. What can have one army men [inaudible] I've got [inaudible] power. Um, so this is the kind of the ultimate, um, low against someone who would like to operate as an individual is to be able at least to make the decision based on your own judgment.

Speaker 1:          25:53          Everything in Harris Jasmine tells him to know this is not something to do. His judgment is not at fault. This hand on top, it has to do, go against his judgment and do something. But every thing in him what require against and warned him against. So this is the ultimate. And he, every decisional process has been taken away from Carrie [inaudible] boat. The boat was confiscated by customs after he was found to be illegal, smuggling bigger that was confiscated something away from him. Um, and now we know he has no money in legal education. Business Visit [inaudible] oh, so is at this moment, this is the absolute low point, I would say, uh, for Eric and now I want to go to a slightly trajectory with, I let her suggest is actually the beginning of an upward to Jeffrey. And the beginning of this upward podiatry is going to be very, very stark is Harry as a rough, ironic have.

Speaker 1:          27:16          Um, this is the moment where we know that Harry is by has been one that, you know, all the Cubans would feel good by Harry. And Harry was also failing when the girl, the big Cuban art. So all of them, uh, with iron on the boat, but herrings can last to die. Um, and he, this is the moment before his dad, um, where he has at that moment he was on his back now with his knees drawn out and there's a head to water of the lake that was, his valley was very cold, so cold that when he stepped in his edge, it known Tim and he was extremely cold now and everything tasted of their solving as though he'd been sucking on a hose to siphon a 10. Can you? There was no to him, although he would feel a coal rubber pose the same to have answered his mouth and now was called big coat and heavy or down through him.

Speaker 1:          28:23          Each time he took a breath to host called Koden, firmer in his lower abdomen. And you could feel it like a big smooth moving snake in there about the sloshing after me. This is a chapter 20 chapter 20 verse you to read that chapter. The beast, the couples attitude is great. Ray Wendell clinics, um, admitted to having, um, really impressive pros and to have and have not been, must have been thinking of. Chapter 20 is just rich chapter. Um, and it's about the vote with dead men and the fish. I mean to, uh, fish under turpines from wounds on them. Uh, but is, is a way the friction of human mortality, uh, against the sea. Very [inaudible], honestly living sea creatures. Um, but the passage right here is the description and I think that it maybe is a challenge from anyway, although I wouldn't want to push this too much.

Speaker 1:          29:36          Um, is a challenge to us to think about what it means to die and what exactly do when you have at the moment of death. Um, Harriet doesn't have something, although it's not anything that anyone would want to have. It has this rubber hose that is inside him, that's making him colder and colder. Um, it is not a possession that we would bond to you for is, it was if most of us would like to have taken all but is the possession nonetheless. So I would like to at least put forth the possible, uh, argument are bad because of the kind of life that Harry has lived. Um, even though there's so many strikes against him, even though all the odds are against him, the bone of that Ashley is his own moment in a sense that he's living his physicality to do this is not a dying without knowing that you are dying off if he doesn't lose consciousness after that it is experiencing that too is pull us expand.

Speaker 1:          30:59          Um, and uh, and just having that register on every fiber of your being. I don't know how much we want to push on this point. Um, but I like to see this as the beginning of the kind of upward swing of the narrative that this is the moment where we can begin to start thinking of heralded as a half now. And you start thinking of him as a half, although have in a very ironic sense, having a possession that most of us would much rather than I have. But from this point I like make like to make a Muslim ward systematic arguing about Harry as the have. Do they have anyways, great deliberate fashion. So I would very much want to argue that this is actually the basic structure of to happen, has not, um, is to show airy as a half should immediated presence of other people looking at him through the reef and looking at him through ritual.

Speaker 1:          32:12          So what Marie and things parent, I'm lucky she was thinking those girls, they don't know what they look at. I know what I've got and what I've had. I've been lucky. I've been lucky woman. They ain't no other man like that. He will never find them. Don't know. I've had plenty of them. I've been lucky to have him. Um, is suggested to us that um, movie was a spoiling Logan, um, as a profession. Um, so she's had lots of men in her professional capacity. Um, and it is from that wealth of knowledge of man that she can stay, that Harry is really, is at that point. It's the best, uh, this child more and there's just no one hammer. So it's a dubious kind of confidence. You know, you don't want to have a positive time saying that testimony to the fact that you're the best, um, when that happens to be your wife.

Speaker 1:          33:26          Um, so once again, having ways really taking away with one hand what is doing with another, but there is no question that heroin has made Marie's my life that she's enjoying that moment that she's having a good one, she's having a good life only because of him. He is the thing that gives her a good life. Um, and that is the measure of what Harry has. So it's very much more complicated media. He has something because of the good life that Marie has because of him. And without Marie, we wouldn't have been able to say that. Um, so this is the first upward swing of that trajectory to us, Harry, as a possible have. And I would like to add that it is not just because of the way that he's treated Marie and the way that [inaudible] has is now having a lot because of him but also because of the way he looks at me.

Speaker 1:          34:33          So there is actually coming from him as well. We can sort of understand why Maria is having a good life now. Um, and was, he has made all the difference to her life. So here the wreath Harry is going on is dangerous for the humans. After when he knows that it's the bank robbery that his estate and re wants to go with him just to take care of the jobs and your ticket because he has only one arm at this point. You want to do something for him on a boat and she wants to come along. So he says, all right. He told her as she got into beside him a big woman long, they get big handed, they can still handsome. Had the boat over the beetle one hair you wrote about Harry? I don't know. I'm just worried. Listen, are you letting her hair grow out?

Speaker 1:          35:27          I thought I was, the goals have been asking me, how will you keep it like it is? Do you really want me to yes, he's had. That's the way I like him. You don't, they look to you, you look better than any of them. So that's why that's why we has a good life is because of the way how each resort and we see exactly how he treats him, um, that he liked the way she is. And um, you know, and he tells her that was worried but he doesn't want to tell her the full span of it, of his worries. He changes the subject when she wants to find out from the um, all this make Maria's life the good life 10. It is all encapsulated in this one small passage. And the contrast of that comes out in that previous passage. We know that is probably big woman and she has a of long, they big hands, hips and so on.

Speaker 1:          36:29          Uh, we don't know exactly how big she is until we get to see her through the eyes of Richard Gordon. And then is the kind of a shock to see this passage, uh, coming through the eyes of neutral, uh, hospital observer. Other than that, I believe apple is in your top. Um, but a very unkind, neutral observer riding his bicycle. It has a heavy said, big blue eyed woman with bleach blonde here showing under the old man's belt, have her n across the row, eyes red some crime. Looking at that, look at that big arcs with that. What is it was a woman like that, things that are well disciplined. She goes, she does in bed. What does your husband feel about her when she gets their size? In today's chapter, he was going to use the big woman, but it's here. And I would, the scene on the way home.

Speaker 1:          37:32          Her husband, when he came home at night, he'd ever hated the way she, of course, and grown heavy sleep. Hell, I had bleached hair. The two big breasts he has seen in the last of perception, the whole inner life of death to happen. Let. So Hemingway is both dramatizing the process of labeling people making of social types and showing considerable, uh, doubt whether that is at the practice to say the least. I'll get this really interesting that Richard Gordon is a writer. So, you know, I think the Hemingways probably thinking about himself as well and where there is an entirely ethical practice even to populate his novel with Social Types of thing. Right now he's actually creating another social type of writer who doesn't care about subjects and wants to use them, um, to wreck novels to someone's heart attack. Um, so, um, this is, uh, he's both make talking about, which of course may be expressing a little bit of wearing that himself as well.

Speaker 1:          38:48          But in any case, if we move away from Hemingway's on investment and his psychology, um, possible psychology, including someone like Richard Gordon, we can say that this is a dry rag affirmation of what a kind man Harry Morgan is and is not just kindness that enables him to look. How's thickness of Maria is, is probably the largest clients on is understating the case. It's something else are there truly doesn't bother me that she's so big when it probably work, most people will have noticed that about her. Uh, so it says something about, uh, that relationship, whatever we call it, it is one that turns the big woman to have you for one. Um, and to the extent that Harry is able to do that years ago in petitions so much, he has a kind of emotional magic that changes the re into something else. And in the process of that transformation, he also acquires an identity.

Speaker 1:          40:05          He is the person who's being able to do this to me and do this for me. This is the ultimate measure or someone who has magic in his hand and it is the lab of magic that makes me supporting the water rather than he is Richard Garland is, is, was probably once a very, very good way. He, here's an IRA, this was seat. We're thrilled to meet him. Um, but at a point where meeting him, he's waiting the crap around you to be on the wane. Um, and we begin to see those are what a bad way that he is. And this supposedly neutral a portrait of Marie is that all, you know, business is the size of this woman. She doesn't want to listen to. The most important fact about Marie is that her eyes are red from prior to his soul. It if you're asking, so the imagination that he misses the central fact, this is we're reading knows that Eric is dead.

Speaker 1:          41:06          And that was why the eyes are to hear random reticle is not a poor rhino. Then he can ask you the most obvious thing about from the way in this eagerness to turn into a social time and in this exchange views on why we see, um, that the fact that he's a bad driver. I'm also always seems to spill out. And as a kind of analogy, uh, and his relation with his wife Helen who leaving him. Uh, and this is, um, this is actually one of the great moments. I'm not calling you with full extent of, um, of Helen speech, but go and look at page one wanting, we filing this long, long speech about love and um, the is dripping with irony about what she feels about lovely coming from Richard Gordon. Um, but that is the end of that conversation. All right, I'm through with you and I'm through with love.

Speaker 1:          42:08          Your can pick, knows love you. Random you loan mix nuts sloughed. Don't call me names. I know with you all right. No, not are all wrong. Ryan, if you would, just a good writer. I understand. Stand all the rest of it. Maybe the last scene you bitter, jealous, changing your politics to suit the fashion, sucking up to people's faces and talking about them behind the Bads I've seen you do on the city. Um, so what kind of person, which of course is can always be register in full buyer. Someone who's fired site all the time. That is the most accurate picture of Michigan and kind become person here. So it is, unfortunately, they're completely cleans out everything that we lose everything. Um, his claim to fame is claimed to craftsmanship is cleaning to right region is planes in Greg romantic Glover. Um, all those things have been emptied out by Helen in this moment.

Speaker 1:          43:13          If we think about the cemetery, the change, uh, Harry channeled through Murray and Richard Gordon channeled through Helen is very quiet not to come to the conclusion that we need to have an alternative definition of what means to be a half and what it means to be a, have not, um, it's not so easy to add a label, you know, to what the criteria might be for cat, for someone to can't have the criteria on the much too complicated to be captured as by one word. That's really the point. Uh, descends as way to put it as that, in order to be a have you have to make somebody else or have the read house of her life because of Harry and Harry has something because Marie has a good life. This is symmetrical construction of house in Hemingway's novels. Um, so I would say that actually this is, I'm having ways, I often criticized for being the very poor writer when it comes to women.

Speaker 1:          44:31          And that is true. And I was with his mom, his own imagination for what my feel to be a woman. Uh, but this is actually an exception of Disney, how fall, um, depiction of the human condition from the woman's point of view. And so, um, I, with in conclusion, I like to bring up one celebrated a passage for is writing a total from the standpoint of a woman's point of view and have just a little anecdote that [inaudible] aeration for James Stores. He saw James Joyce in Paris, uh, [inaudible] eating the sandwich and they were all speaking Italian in Paris, was very, very impressed. Um, but so it was not an fitting, uh, to compare him with choice in this most famous passage in joy's Malia Soliloquy, that [inaudible] of us'. And I thought, well as well him as another. And then I asked him if my eyes to ask again.

Speaker 1:          45:37          Yes. And then he asked me would I yes. To say yes, my mountain flower. And first I put my arms around him. Yes. And threw him down to the so he could feel my breasts all perfume. Yes. And his heart was going like man and yes. I said yes, I will. Yes. So this lovely blue thinking of how long time ago, you know, marriage has really gone sour many ways. Um, [inaudible] um, but thinking back to that moment when she agrees to marry lyrical loo and um, obviously whilst Angeles's from that note, that very early romance we from to a woman's love from man and a man slash woman, this is not quite, not quite, that is the opposite of that, but I would argue is just as powerful as well known as Molly Soliloquy. Um, it was, how do you get through it? Nice. If you can sleep, I guess you find out that you find out how it feels.

Speaker 1:          46:46          How can, I guess you find out all right. I guess you find out everything and discount them life I guess you do already because I'm probably finding out right now you just go dead inside and everything is easy. You just get that. Like most people are. Most of the time. I guess that's how it is. All right. I guess that's just about what happens to you. Well, I know the thought. I've got a good star. If that's what we have to do. I guess that's where you'd have to do. All right. I guess that's it. I guess that's what it comes from. All right. I've got the start done and where you're living now, um, having all the sounds like Gertrude Stein and other obvious favorite few, and then it also sounds a little bit anyway [inaudible] he really does sound like, which is nice. Um, this is kind of senseless repetition. This is not elephant in compulsive repetition on [inaudible] had a good life taken away from her and so forth. And the fact that she's had a good life and in the fact that it's just going hysterical when dad is [inaudible] to come from him and he doesn't want slowly yes, social time.
