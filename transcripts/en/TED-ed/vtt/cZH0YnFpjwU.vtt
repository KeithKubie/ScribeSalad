00:00:10.947 --> 00:00:18.489
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, and zero.

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:24.188
With just these ten symbols, we can
write any rational number imaginable.

00:00:24.188 --> 00:00:26.691
But why these particular symbols?

00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:28.352
Why ten of them?

00:00:28.352 --> 00:00:31.599
And why do we arrange them the way we do?

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.419
Numbers have been a fact of life
throughout recorded history.

00:00:35.419 --> 00:00:39.849
Early humans likely counted animals
in a flock or members in a tribe

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:42.989
using body parts or tally marks.

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.480
But as the complexity of life increased,
along with the number of things to count,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.550
these methods were no longer sufficient.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.049
So as they developed,

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:56.808
different civilizations came up 
with ways of recording higher numbers.

00:00:56.808 --> 00:00:58.059
Many of these systems,

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:58.819
like Greek,

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:59.539
Hebrew,

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:00.770
and Egyptian numerals,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.300
were just extensions of tally marks

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.350
with new symbols added to represent
larger magnitudes of value.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.150
Each symbol was repeated as many times
as necessary and all were added together.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.990
Roman numerals added another twist.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.490
If a numeral appeared before one
with a higher value,

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.950
it would be subtracted rather than added.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.450
But even with this innovation,

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.501
it was still a cumbersome method
for writing large numbers.

00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:30.861
The way to a more useful 
and elegant system

00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:35.041
lay in something called 
positional notation.

00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:38.430
Previous number systems needed to draw
many symbols repeatedly

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.610
and invent a new symbol 
for each larger magnitude.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.971
But a positional system could reuse
the same symbols,

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:50.962
assigning them different values
based on their position in the sequence.

00:01:50.962 --> 00:01:54.911
Several civilizations developed positional
notation independently,

00:01:54.911 --> 00:01:56.822
including the Babylonians,

00:01:56.822 --> 00:01:58.032
the Ancient Chinese,

00:01:58.032 --> 00:01:59.982
and the Aztecs.

00:01:59.982 --> 00:02:04.562
By the 8th century, Indian mathematicians
had perfected such a system

00:02:04.562 --> 00:02:06.552
and over the next several centuries,

00:02:06.552 --> 00:02:12.343
Arab merchants, scholars, and conquerors
began to spread it into Europe.

00:02:12.343 --> 00:02:16.043
This was a decimal, or base ten, system,

00:02:16.043 --> 00:02:20.514
which could represent any number
using only ten unique glyphs.

00:02:20.514 --> 00:02:23.943
The positions of these symbols
indicate different powers of ten,

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:27.483
starting on the right 
and increasing as we move left.

00:02:27.483 --> 00:02:30.203
For example, the number 316

00:02:30.203 --> 00:02:33.693
reads as 6x10^0

00:02:33.693 --> 00:02:36.292
plus 1x10^1

00:02:36.292 --> 00:02:39.943
plus 3x10^2.

00:02:39.943 --> 00:02:41.833
A key breakthrough of this system,

00:02:41.833 --> 00:02:44.734
which was also independently 
developed by the Mayans,

00:02:44.734 --> 00:02:47.483
was the number zero.

00:02:47.483 --> 00:02:50.573
Older positional notation systems 
that lacked this symbol

00:02:50.573 --> 00:02:52.394
would leave a blank in its place,

00:02:52.394 --> 00:02:56.935
making it hard to distinguish 
between 63 and 603,

00:02:56.935 --> 00:03:00.003
or 12 and 120.

00:03:00.003 --> 00:03:04.054
The understanding of zero as both
a value and a placeholder

00:03:04.054 --> 00:03:08.024
made for reliable and consistent notation.

00:03:08.024 --> 00:03:10.393
Of course, it's possible 
to use any ten symbols

00:03:10.393 --> 00:03:13.743
to represent the numerals 
zero through nine.

00:03:13.743 --> 00:03:17.038
For a long time, 
the glyphs varied regionally.

00:03:17.038 --> 00:03:19.202
Most scholars agree 
that our current digits

00:03:19.202 --> 00:03:22.726
evolved from those used in the
North African Maghreb region

00:03:22.726 --> 00:03:24.884
of the Arab Empire.

00:03:24.884 --> 00:03:29.905
And by the 15th century, what we now know
as the Hindu-Arabic numeral system

00:03:29.905 --> 00:03:32.789
had replaced Roman numerals
in everyday life

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:37.275
to become the most commonly 
used number system in the world.

00:03:37.275 --> 00:03:40.726
So why did the Hindu-Arabic system,
along with so many others,

00:03:40.726 --> 00:03:42.859
use base ten?

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.784
The most likely answer is the simplest.

00:03:46.784 --> 00:03:52.355
That also explains why the Aztecs used
a base 20, or vigesimal system.

00:03:52.355 --> 00:03:54.975
But other bases are possible, too.

00:03:54.975 --> 00:03:58.965
Babylonian numerals were sexigesimal,
or base 60.

00:03:58.965 --> 00:04:02.236
Any many people think that a base 12,
or duodecimal system,

00:04:02.236 --> 00:04:04.345
would be a good idea.

00:04:04.345 --> 00:04:08.265
Like 60, 12 is a highly composite number
that can be divided by two,

00:04:08.265 --> 00:04:09.035
three,

00:04:09.035 --> 00:04:09.747
four,

00:04:09.747 --> 00:04:10.926
and six,

00:04:10.926 --> 00:04:14.705
making it much better for representing
common fractions.

00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:17.755
In fact, both systems appear
in our everyday lives,

00:04:17.755 --> 00:04:19.871
from how we measure degrees and time,

00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:23.416
to common measurements,
like a dozen or a gross.

00:04:23.416 --> 00:04:27.166
And, of course, the base two, 
or binary system,

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:30.048
is used in all of our digital devices,

00:04:30.048 --> 00:04:35.966
though programmers also use base eight
and base 16 for more compact notation.

00:04:35.966 --> 00:04:37.990
So the next time you use a large number,

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.396
think of the massive quantity captured
in just these few symbols,

00:04:42.396 --> 00:04:45.779
and see if you can come up 
with a different way to represent it.
