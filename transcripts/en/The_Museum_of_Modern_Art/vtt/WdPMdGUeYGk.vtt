00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.501
(tranquil music)

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.333
- This beautiful book is
titled "KlÃ¤nge," or "Sounds."

00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:12.838
It's by Vasily Kandinsky, who
was a very important painter.

00:00:12.838 --> 00:00:14.715
He also made a number of

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:17.718
illustrated books in the early 1910s.

00:00:17.718 --> 00:00:22.431
It was published in 1913,
but he actually created

00:00:22.431 --> 00:00:24.600
the 56 woodcuts that illustrate

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.021
the book between 1907 and 1912.

00:00:29.021 --> 00:00:31.649
Some are black and white, some are

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:34.276
in beautiful jewel-like color.

00:00:34.276 --> 00:00:37.279
Some of the images are representational.

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:40.023
They seem to illustrate a scene.

00:00:40.023 --> 00:00:45.023
The motif of the rider on
horseback runs through this book.

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.079
Here we have a much more
abstract image of three riders.

00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:53.587
Kandinsky wrote the poems for this book,

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:56.090
and they have a very musical,

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.009
sonorous, onomatopoetic quality.

00:00:59.009 --> 00:01:01.220
The title is "Warum."

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.139
The text is in German, it means "Why."

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:05.015
"Warum?

00:01:05.015 --> 00:01:07.560
"Keiner ist da herausgekommen.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.602
"Keiner?

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:09.256
"Keiner.

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:10.104
"Einer?

00:01:10.104 --> 00:01:11.230
"Nein."

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.274
Kandinsky also designed the book,

00:01:13.274 --> 00:01:17.110
the type face, the page
size, and the binding.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.447
So for him it was really
a total work of art.

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:22.032
It was a very influential book.

00:01:22.032 --> 00:01:24.576
It became a touchstone
for a whole generation.

00:01:24.576 --> 00:01:27.383
There were artists who were
part of the Dada movement

00:01:27.383 --> 00:01:30.040
in Switzerland, and artists who were part

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.459
of the Russian avant-garde in Russia

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:36.588
who would actually recite his
poems at their gatherings.

00:01:36.588 --> 00:01:38.590
Kandinsky is best known as a painter,

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.885
but during these early years of his career

00:01:40.885 --> 00:01:43.428
he was very involved with
the woodcut technique.

00:01:43.428 --> 00:01:46.223
He talked about how
important it was for him

00:01:46.223 --> 00:01:50.060
in simplifying his art, his style,

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.313
because woodcut is a very flat technique

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:56.191
and it has broad areas of form.

00:01:56.191 --> 00:02:00.779
In that process, his imagery
got increasingly abstract.

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:03.281
So it was the woodcut
technique that actually

00:02:03.281 --> 00:02:06.827
helped him develop as an abstract artist.

00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:08.170
