00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.270
If you made it this far in the course, congratulations, you should really be

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.068
proud of all your hard work. You've encountered so much algebra, and my hope is

00:00:07.068 --> 00:00:10.940
that you've learned a lot along the way. We have just two more units left, and

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.730
I hope you'll stay with us to complete the course. In this unit we'll learn

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.960
about the Pythagorean theorem and it's applications. Then we'll move on to see

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.442
the different ways that we can slice a cone. Now these cones will produce some

00:00:24.442 --> 00:00:28.705
intereting patterns. And I can't wait for you to see them. For now let's look

00:00:28.705 --> 00:00:31.330
closely at a special right triangle.
