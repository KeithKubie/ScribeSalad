00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280
My story starts with a duck
pond and with this man, Thomas Young,

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.100
because about
200 years ago, he was sitting by a duck
pond watching some ducks.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.840
And I have here a pair of ducks.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.160
We're going to have a look
at what Thomas Young saw.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.620
Just wind up my ducks.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.200
What he saw, as the
ducks swam around,

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.040
was a pattern appear
in the water, which

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.600
you can see down here.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.860
Now the pattern was caused
by ripples, on the water,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.680
leaving the ducks, and
interfering with each other.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.820
You can see it in a
more controlled way.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.040
Here we have a motor
that's actually

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.250
going to cause ripples.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.420
And it's going to pass
through two slits.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.960
And these slits are going to
produce ripples which go out

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.000
into the water and actually
interfere, very much

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.340
like with the two ducks.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.620
You can see a pattern emerging.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.040
You can see, here,
along this line,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.660
two ripples are adding up.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.440
So you're getting
bright and dark lines.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.700
But here doesn't look
like anything's happening.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.430
That's because the
waves, the ripples,

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.240
have actually cancelled
each other out.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.160
Now, this made him pretty happy.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.860
First of all because he liked
ducks, but second of all,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.660
because it reminded
him of an experiment

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.140
he'd done a couple of
years earlier with light.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.900
I'm going to show
you now what he

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.220
saw with his light experiment.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.100
Here we have something very
similar to the pond and the two ducks

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.380
and actually very
similar to that tank with water

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.010
and the two slits.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.100
Because here we have
something that produces light.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.940
And the light passes through
two slits, actually very close

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.060
together, because light has
a very short wavelength,

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.820
a very small wave.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.860
So you can't actually
see these two slits,

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.139
but it's the same idea.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.800
And then, the light passes
on and hits this screen.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.100
You can actually
see a pattern that's

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.730
quite similar to what we saw
on the tank with the water.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.320
And there are regions of
bright and dark and bright

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.880
and dark and bright and dark.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.000
So this set him thinking, well,
if I saw the same pattern as I

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.480
saw on water and I know that
waves travel on water, that

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.140
must mean that light is a wave.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.500
After all, particles
wouldn't do this.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.120
Let's have a look at
what particles would do.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.280
For this, I need a volunteer
with a lot of puff.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.200
Could you come down?

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.280
Your name is?

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.960
Jay.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.180
Jay.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.482
Could you stand here.

00:03:00.482 --> 00:03:02.315
Now, what you're going
to do is you're going

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:03.950
to blow through this tube.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.360
And here is sand.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.340
Now, sand consists of grains,
particles, lots of them.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.160
And they're all packed in here.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.140
And as Jay blows,
he's actually going

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:22.344
to blow sand through this box,
up against these two slits.

00:03:22.344 --> 00:03:24.260
And the sand can pass
through these two slits,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.500
very much like two
slits we had with light.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.560
And on the back here,
we've got a screen,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.260
which is going to collect
the particles of sand

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.910
as they go through the slits.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.600
So huff and a puff and
blow through the tube Jay.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.480
Keep going.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.120
Great.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.800
You can do it a little bit less.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.920
That's it.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:49.580
That's great.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:50.635
Thanks very much.

00:03:50.635 --> 00:03:51.510
Go back to your seat.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.760
I'm just going to show
you what's on the screen.

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:03.640
And this is it.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.630
It's not really a surprise.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.770
There are two stripes, very
much like the two slits.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.070
Because of course, sand
consists of grains,

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.450
like little particles.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.279
And they either go
through one slit

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.310
or they go through
the other slit.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.970
And that's what you're seeing.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.100
These particles have
gone through one slit.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.080
These have gone
through the other slit.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.840
So this is what sand does.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.404
And this is what particles
do, they produce this pattern.

00:04:30.404 --> 00:04:32.680
And it's unlike the pattern
that you get with waves.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.520
Now, we're going to try
something a little different.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.530
We saw the pattern
that light produced.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.720
It's nothing like the sand.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.400
But here, we've
got, essentially,

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.470
the same piece of
equipment as before,

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.440
but we're to turn the
brightness of the light down.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.960
Here we have the source
of light over here.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.270
And it's passing
through two slits.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.670
We've had to cover this up,
because we don't want any light

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.300
to get in.

00:05:01.132 --> 00:05:02.990
The light passes
through the two slits,

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.682
goes over to the other side,
instead of a screen over here,

00:05:05.682 --> 00:05:07.640
we've actually got a
camera, because this detects

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.900
really low levels of light.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.540
I'm going to see what we see.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.060
Actually, up there
on the screen,

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.820
you can see what the
camera's picking up.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.500
The first surprise is it's
picking up dots, blips.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.480
This is light
travelling through this.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.040
But it's arriving as blips,
like the sand, as particles.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.940
So that's amazing.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.580
But have a look at this.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.260
If we collect up all these
blips, collected over a time

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.540
period and have a look
at what the pattern is,

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.260
we see something
quite remarkable.

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:12.300
The pattern you see is the
pattern that waves make.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.920
But the light arrives in blips,
in packets, as small particles,

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.220
which physicists call photons.

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.500
So this is incredible, because
the light's travelling,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.660
making a pattern as though it
were going through two slits.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.690
Because remember, to make that
pattern, that wave pattern,

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.610
there've got to be two
sources, two slits.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:39.040
The light's got to go
through both slits.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.160
And yet it's arriving as a blip,
as a particle, like the sand.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.260
This is the essence of the
weirdness of the spookiness

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.540
in the quantum world.
