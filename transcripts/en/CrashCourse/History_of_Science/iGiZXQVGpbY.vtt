00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.780
We’ve seen how, from around 400 BCE to CE
1300, ideas in astronomy, math, and engineering

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.980
were traded all the way from Beijing to Delhi,
and from Baghdad to Constantinople.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.830
In the next episodes, we’re going to dive
into how some specific kinds of knowledge

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.860
evolved over time.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.940
First up: healing.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.230
The history of medicine is about two of our
big questions: one, what is life?

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.189
What makes it so special, so fragile, so…
goopy!?

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.609
Two, how do we know what we know?

00:00:34.609 --> 00:00:37.260
Why should I take my doctor’s advice?

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.719
Why are deep-fried Oreos bad for me?

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.499
It may be tempting to look at medicine as
a science that has simply progressed over

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:48.489
time—that medicine used to be bad, and its
history is a story of how it got better.

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:50.940
And don’t get me wrong: we love modern medicine!

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.229
You’ll have to take my word for it until
“Crash Course: Deep-Fried Everything”

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:58.229
drops, but the science behind lipid transport
is just fascinating.

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.159
Focusing on progress, though, obscures what
worked in the past.

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:05.600
Ancient and medieval medicine worked for millions
of people.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.490
They understood their bodies as bounded by
rules.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.460
And regardless of what worked, early medical
systems allowed people to make sense of bodies

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:14.530
and health.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.590
You may think that medicine is a technē,
or practically oriented knowledge.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.561
But today, we’re going to focus on systems
of medicine as world-ordering theories, or

00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:24.590
epistēmē.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.229
These theories were built up into a textual
tradition, in which doctors wrote down what

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.040
they saw and cited earlier doctors when explaining
their treatments.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.619
So let’s turn to medical education.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.820
What textbooks would a would-be doctor read
in a given place and time?

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:50.460
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.000
Let’s say you lived in Song Dynasty China:
you’d study machine-printed textbooks on

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.799
traditional Chinese medicine, or TCM.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:05.140
In this system, humans are small pieces of
one vast organism called the Entire Dang Universe.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.090
All things within this system are composed
of five elements: fire, earth, metal, water,

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.090
and wood.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.530
In TCM, health means a balance between two
forces, yin and yang, representing dark and

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.760
light, femininity and masculinity, hot and
cold, and so on.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.090
Disease means imbalance.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.569
Thus healthcare means restoring balance, in
TCM, by manipulating the energy that flows

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.430
through living bodies, called qi.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.270
You, the would-be doc, would learn all about
how to move qi around using acupuncture and

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.260
acupressure, herbal therapies, exercise, and
prescription diets.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.879
If you lived in Gupta Dynasty India, you’d
also get down with a five-element theory of

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:44.879
matter.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.910
But you would study the science of life, Ayurveda.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:52.360
You’d probably pick up the popular textbook
Charaka Samhita, or one of the other samhita—or

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.820
“collections”—that could help you memorize
hundreds of named body parts.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.890
In addition to anatomy, the samhitas would
also teach you etiology, or what causes different

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.370
diseases, and symptomatology, or what diseases
look like.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.030
When it came to treatment, your samhita would
have information on the eight specialites:

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.319
the diseases of children, those of the elderly,
mental diseases, diseases of the sense organs,

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.920
surgery, poisons and antidotes, and aphrodisiacs.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.690
You would learn the five karmas or actions
that were used for removal of toxins from

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:22.690
body tissues.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.599
And, to prepare treatments, you’d learn
a lot about plants, minerals, and animals.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.480
But treating patients is only part of Ayurveda.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.500
The science of life concerns healthful living
in general, including how to prevent disease

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.579
and influence hygiene and diet.

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.730
What if you lived in, say, fourteenth-century
Bologna, Italy—home to one of the oldest

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.200
universities in the world, which opened in
CE 1088!

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.439
You would attend lectures, and you’d have
a hand-copied textbook, not made by a press

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:49.670
as in Song China.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.359
The medical theories in your textbook would
be founded on Aristotelian biology and physics.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.150
Bodies are composed of four special bodily
humors.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.810
Each of these corresponds to one of the four
elements of Empedocles: blood, made of air,

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.629
phlegm, made of water, yellow bile, made of
fire, and black bile, made of earth.

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:09.879
Illness is an imbalance in the humors.

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.799
Too much black bile, for example, causes depression.

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.350
Treatment means restoring the right humoral
balance—like, with bloodletting.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.320
When too much of one humor built up in the
body, one way to restore a balance was to

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.890
let some of the excess drain off.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.230
But the most common treatment, then as now,
was simply offering good dietary advice.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.510
Aristotle linked the four elements with the
humors, but he wasn’t a doctor.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.460
The oldest nuggets of humoral wisdom in Western
Eurasian medical textbooks were attributed

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.600
to a physician named Hippocrates of Cos, which
means “Gregory House” in classical Greek.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.220
We know something of his life—he died when
Aristotle was in his teens—but we don’t

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.540
have many surviving works by him.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.340
What we do have is a collection of texts of
various age and unknown authorship called

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.790
the Hippocratic corpus.

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:57.150
According to the corpus, Hippocrates I was
a fan of the Pythagoreans.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.890
(Remember, the secret math cult?)

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:04.400
But his skepticism—or doubt that certain
knowledge is possible—set Hippocratic medicine

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.840
apart from a lot of Greek natural philosophy.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.270
Hippocrates emphasized reason, observation,
and medical prediction.

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.410
He emphasized that diet and the environment
influence health, not the direct will of the

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:16.410
gods.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.700
And his oath—“do no harm”—still underpins
medical education.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.040
Hippocrates was the Jimi Hendrix of Eurasian
and North African medicine, innovating a new

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.510
style that challenged traditional ideas.

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.790
But Hippocratic physicians had to compete
among many schools of healers.

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.740
It was a Roman named Galen who became medicine’s
Michael Jackson—the popularizer of a standard

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.320
humorism that would last until the 1800s.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:43.910
Galen’s system absorbed the smaller, uneven
Hippocratic corpus.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.120
Galen was born around CE 130 in Pergamon.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.170
But he made his career in Rome, treating gladiators.

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:54.760
This gave him lots of experience peeking into
the body while sewing up wounds.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:59.570
Eventually he got the offer of a lifetime:
court physician to Emperor Marcus Aurelius,

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.610
who was a battle-hardened general, Stoic philosopher,
and all-around hardcore dude.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.010
Galen wrote a huge number of influential texts—supposedly
five hundred!

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:11.180
Though only eighty-three survive today.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.970
These show that Galen built on the systems
of Hippocrates and Aristotle, but also made

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:19.360
detailed notes on human anatomy drawn from
experience.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.900
He accurately observed how the larynx works
and demonstrated the the lungs fill up with

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.900
air.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.440
Oh ya, and he innovated cataract surgery.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.730
But Galen definitely got some things wrong.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.820
One reason is that human dissection was illegal
in imperial Rome and the states that succeeded

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:35.820
it.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.210
So a lot of anatomy was still guesswork based
on observations of animals.

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.420
For example, dissecting sheep heads, Galen
identified a circulatory organ called a rete

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:50.200
mirabile or “wonderful net” that is found
in animals like sheep and dolphins… but

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.660
doesn’t actually exist in humans.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.890
After Galen, the most notable medical theorists
in the Greater Mediterranean weren’t Greeks

00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:01.620
or Romans, but Arabs or Persians who had access
to both Greek and Indian sciences.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.870
First among was the Persian polymath Abū
Bakr al-Rāzī —whose name also means “Gregory

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:07.870
House.”

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:12.560
Born in CE 854, al-Rāzī was prolific: he
wrote dozens of books, including detailed

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.600
accounts of his cases.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.690
He is considered by many historians to be
one of the founders of several disciplines,

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:19.480
from psychology to opthamology.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:24.140
And he was the first to describe smallpox
and measles as distinct diseases.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.570
Al-Rāzī also wrote for general audiences,
educating them about health and disease.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:33.270
Many of his works were encyclopedias based
on Greek humoral medicine and natural philosophy.

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:39.580
His big one, al-Hawi al-Kabir or The Virtuous
Life, was a large, influential medical encyclopedia.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.560
Al-Rāzī was a unique dude who did exactly
what he wanted.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.300
Although he was one of the most scientific
doctors of his time, he also wrote works of

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.320
Islamic prophetic medicine, al-tibb al-nabawi.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:54.420
This discipline, an alternative to the Hippocratic–Galenic
system, advocated traditional medical practices

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.161
mentioned in the Qur’an.

00:07:56.161 --> 00:08:00.890
Al-Rāzī also influenced medicine by becoming
the first fan of Greco-Roman humoral medicine

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.010
to beef with Galen!

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:08.860
He wrote a book called Shukuk ‘ala alinusor—Doubts
About Galen—in which he said that his own

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.750
observations contradicted some of Galen’s
claims.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:16.170
Remember nullius in verba—“on the word
of no one”—the motto of the Royal Society

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.550
of London, founded in 1660?

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:25.030
Al-Rāzī advocated this approach to medicine
circa the year 900, over seven hundred years

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.030
earlier!

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:29.200
But, if you were really a medieval Italian
medical student, the book you’d read probably

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.700
wouldn’t be by Hippocrates, Galen, or al-Rāzī.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.889
Instead, you’d read a translated encyclopedia
featuring all of them.

00:08:35.889 --> 00:08:41.070
In doing so, you’d participate in the scientific
wonder called Scholasticism—or learning

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:46.009
through close readings of approved texts that
recorded the observations and theories of

00:08:46.009 --> 00:08:47.430
earlier thinkers.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:48.589
Take it away, Thought Bubble!

00:08:48.589 --> 00:08:53.520
One of the all-time greatest hits of medical
education was al-Qānūn fī al-Ṭibb, or

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.100
The Canon of Medicine.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:59.980
The Canon was written by another Persian polymath,
Ibn Sina, born in 980.

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:04.750
Ibn Sina was widely seen as the best writer
to summarize and comment on the Greco-Roman

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:05.750
doctors.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:10.639
His Canon became one of the most important
medical textbooks—and introductions to Aristotle’s

00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:12.570
physics—for six hundred years.

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:15.720
Your textbook is really a mashup of several
different books.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:22.070
Each page is like an onion: at its heart,
one punctum or big idea by Aristotle, or Hippocrates

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.070
or Galen.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:27.959
These are surrounded by layer upon layer of
annotatio, or notes, by famous physicians

00:09:27.959 --> 00:09:30.029
from distant cities such as Baghdad.

00:09:30.029 --> 00:09:34.610
Your main throughline are the summaries by
Ibn-Sina, whose name has been latinized as

00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:35.610
“Avicenna”.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:41.259
But there are notes by Latin translators such
as Gerard de Cremona or Constantinus Africanus,

00:09:41.259 --> 00:09:44.819
plus outer layers of notes by other medical
students.

00:09:44.819 --> 00:09:47.380
Maybe you even jot down your own.

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:52.790
Thus—way before WebMD—you’re in conversation
with doctors from all across space!

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:53.790
And time!

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:58.490
In universities such as Bologna or Salerno,
you might also have access to another textbook,

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.610
this one by… wait for it… a lady!

00:10:00.610 --> 00:10:05.389
Trota of Salerno wrote Practical Medicine
According to Trota and Treatments of Women,

00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:07.810
one of books of the The Trotula Ensemble.

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:12.470
This group of three texts from around 1200
traveled widely throughout medieval Europe.

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:17.399
The Trotula became foundational to gynecology
and all other topics related to women’s

00:10:17.399 --> 00:10:18.399
health.

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:21.370
But you might not know that this foundational
text on women’s health was written by a

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.550
woman, because her identity was systematically
written out of history until the late twentieth

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.940
century.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.110
Because of course it was.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:29.110
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:34.589
So what was “life” for many educated people
in Asia and North Africa between roughly 400

00:10:34.589 --> 00:10:36.640
BCE to CE 1300?

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:41.810
Life was a universal property of which humans
were just interesting examples.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:46.290
Life was linked to the movements of special
fluids, which were the objects of medical

00:10:46.290 --> 00:10:47.290
treatments.

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:51.430
Life was ultimately built out of a smaller
number of elements, and good health meant

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.009
balancing fluids and elements in the right
way.

00:10:54.009 --> 00:10:55.649
How did we know what life is?

00:10:55.649 --> 00:11:00.300
For some physicians in classical Greece or
imperial Rome, careful observation and comparison

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.319
to animals were crucial methods.

00:11:02.319 --> 00:11:06.970
Persian doctors, influenced by both Greek
and Indian ideas, synthesized earlier ideas,

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.800
expanded evidence for them, and challenged
and reworked them.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.319
Why did you, medieval citizen, trust this
information?

00:11:13.319 --> 00:11:14.689
Because books told you to!

00:11:14.689 --> 00:11:20.230
And with that, dear student, we leave you
to deal with… the Black Plague of 1347.

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:21.639
Bummer!

00:11:21.639 --> 00:11:25.589
Next time—we’ll deep-dive into the eternal
question of “what is stuff” with a group

00:11:25.589 --> 00:11:30.259
of thinkers who tried to “science” lead
into gold—the alchemists.

00:11:30.259 --> 00:11:33.689
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:11:33.689 --> 00:11:37.720
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.720
Thought Cafe.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.490
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:44.250

with us, you can check out some of our other

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:47.629
