00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.650
Since this object is not one of the objects that comes for

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.330
free with a function, it does not have it's own .constructor property.

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.778
And this lookup would fail and fall through twice, all the way to car.prototype.

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:17.630
So since car.prototype.contructor is car, amy.constructor is also car.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.620
What code could you write to resolve this issue?
