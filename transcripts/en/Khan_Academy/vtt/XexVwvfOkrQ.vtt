00:00:00.693 --> 00:00:02.887
- [Voiceover] Ngozi I think
that's how I would pronounce it,

00:00:02.887 --> 00:00:05.051
Ngazi, gozi, needs to send out,

00:00:05.051 --> 00:00:06.687
300 wedding invitations,

00:00:06.687 --> 00:00:08.719
let me underline that.

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:10.151
300 wedding invitations.

00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:14.769
In 1 minute, she can put 6
invitations into envelopes

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.904
and apply stamps to them.

00:00:18.904 --> 00:00:21.746
It takes her a minimum of 50 seconds

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:25.060
to address each invitation by hand.

00:00:25.318 --> 00:00:28.565
If n represents the number of invitations

00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:32.185
Ngozi can prepare for
mailing in 180 minutes,

00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:33.983
in 180 minutes,

00:00:33.983 --> 00:00:36.610
which of the following
inequalities best models

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.140
the situation described above.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.917
Over here you have 180
greater than or equal to

00:00:41.917 --> 00:00:44.243
something, it's in terms of
and in terms of the number

00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:45.225
of invitations.

00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:46.590
Is 180 greater than.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.754
This is 300 less than or equal to.

00:00:48.754 --> 00:00:52.000
This is 300 less than right over here.

00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:54.703
Now remember what our constraint is here,

00:00:54.703 --> 00:00:56.393
our constrain is how many can she prepare

00:00:56.393 --> 00:01:00.209
in 180 minutes.

00:01:00.487 --> 00:01:03.805
How many invitations can
she prepare in 180 minutes

00:01:04.317 --> 00:01:06.395
and so it feels like

00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:08.553
and I haven't done the math here,

00:01:08.553 --> 00:01:09.816
that you're going to want one of them

00:01:09.816 --> 00:01:11.677
that deals with the 180

00:01:11.711 --> 00:01:14.119
and since you can do it up to 180

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.442
that you would want not
just the amount of time

00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:18.426
is less than 180 but would have to be

00:01:18.426 --> 00:01:19.391
less than or equal to.

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:23.237
180 doesn't just need to be
greater than the amount of time,

00:01:23.322 --> 00:01:24.490
it could be greater than or equal to,

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.940
as long as this is equal
to 180 we are fine.

00:01:28.422 --> 00:01:30.626
So without doing any
math I'm already feeling

00:01:31.446 --> 00:01:32.968
that this right over here is going

00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:34.090
to be the answer.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.857
The 300, they're getting
this from the fact

00:01:35.857 --> 00:01:39.673
that there's 300 wedding invitations.

00:01:40.124 --> 00:01:43.019
That there's 300 wedding
invitations to make,

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:45.575
now that is the absolute cap...

00:01:45.575 --> 00:01:47.489
That is the absolute cap on the total

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:51.142
number of wedding
invitations that she might

00:01:51.142 --> 00:01:53.529
be able to do, but
that's not going to be...

00:01:53.787 --> 00:01:55.860
That's not the constraint
that we're talking about,

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.106
we're constraining her actual time here.

00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:02.225
Let's verify that we feel good about this

00:02:02.225 --> 00:02:04.220
and it looks they did
everything in minutes,

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.856
so let's do everything in minutes,

00:02:05.856 --> 00:02:08.410
so any one envelope...

00:02:08.978 --> 00:02:11.027
Let's see in 1 minute she can put

00:02:11.027 --> 00:02:13.308
6 invitations into envelopes,

00:02:13.688 --> 00:02:14.490
so any 1 invitation,

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.577
I guess I could say,

00:02:17.107 --> 00:02:18.351
How much time would she spend

00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:21.263
sticking it into an envelope
and applying stamps?

00:02:21.263 --> 00:02:23.437
Well she's going to spend
a sixth of a minute.

00:02:23.888 --> 00:02:26.241
So she's going to spend 1/6 of a minute,

00:02:26.241 --> 00:02:26.986
I'm going to do everything in minutes

00:02:26.986 --> 00:02:28.927
because these look like they're
in minutes right over here.

00:02:28.927 --> 00:02:31.558
A sixth of a minute
putting any one invitation

00:02:31.558 --> 00:02:33.925
into an envelope and
putting stamps on them

00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:37.070
and then how much time will
she spend writing the address?

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.644
Well she's going to spend 50
seconds to write the address

00:02:39.644 --> 00:02:41.544
for any one invitation,

00:02:41.544 --> 00:02:42.956
but if it's in terms of minutes,

00:02:42.956 --> 00:02:45.749
that's 50 out of 60 seconds in a minute.

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:47.324
Or, so we could write this...

00:02:47.324 --> 00:02:49.441
We could write this + 5/6...

00:02:50.391 --> 00:02:51.886
5/6 of...

00:02:51.886 --> 00:02:56.403
+ 5/6 of a minute and I'm really tempted

00:02:56.403 --> 00:02:59.908
to add these because they
add up to one to six sixth,

00:02:59.908 --> 00:03:01.822
but it doesn't look like
they added them over here,

00:03:01.822 --> 00:03:02.685
so I'm going to keep them like this.

00:03:02.685 --> 00:03:04.920
This is how much time in
minutes she would spend

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.525
on any one...

00:03:06.525 --> 00:03:08.221
On any one invitation

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:09.857
and then if she's doing n...

00:03:09.857 --> 00:03:11.919
If she's doing n invitations,

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:13.703
well that's...

00:03:13.703 --> 00:03:16.598
This is per invitation and
then you multiply by n,

00:03:16.948 --> 00:03:18.708
so times n,

00:03:18.708 --> 00:03:19.924
this is the total amount
of time she would spend

00:03:19.924 --> 00:03:21.590
if she did n invitations,

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.459
and so this thing right over here

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.934
has to be less than or equal to 180.

00:03:26.222 --> 00:03:27.126
So we could write it like this,

00:03:27.126 --> 00:03:29.584
we could say less than or equal to 180,

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.890
or we could say that 180...

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.689
Or we could write that 180
is going to be greater than

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.122
or equal to that

00:03:37.122 --> 00:03:38.977
and if you distribute the n...

00:03:39.224 --> 00:03:40.525
If you distribute the n,

00:03:40.525 --> 00:03:41.886
you're going to get this
thing right over here.

00:03:41.886 --> 00:03:45.942
You're going to get 180 is
greater than or equal to

00:03:46.986 --> 00:03:48.871
n over six...

00:03:48.871 --> 00:03:53.012
n/6 plus

00:03:53.842 --> 00:03:54.513
plus

00:03:54.513 --> 00:03:56.371
5n...

00:03:56.371 --> 00:04:00.576
Actually let me write it
that way plus 5 times n...

00:04:01.393 --> 00:04:04.102
5 times n over six.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.196
Over 6.

00:04:10.196 --> 00:04:12.090
Which is exactly what you have here.

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.888
This is really interesting
because just looking

00:04:13.888 --> 00:04:15.726
at the choices it actually
jumped out pretty fast

00:04:15.726 --> 00:04:18.043
that this was probably going to be

00:04:18.043 --> 00:04:20.040
the one that we cared about.
