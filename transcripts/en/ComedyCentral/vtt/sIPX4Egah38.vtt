00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:02.269
The <i>New York Times</i> ran a story

00:00:02.302 --> 00:00:03.804
about how the Trump
administration is doing,

00:00:03.837 --> 00:00:05.939
and it's dark!
Literally.

00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:08.475
Trump aides are reportedly <i>so</i>
unfamiliar with the White House

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.143
that they have meetings
in the dark

00:00:10.177 --> 00:00:11.812
because they can't find
the light switches.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.615
-(laughter)
-Even sad...

00:00:14.648 --> 00:00:17.851
Even sadder-- Trump apparently
splits his time

00:00:17.885 --> 00:00:20.487
between sitting around
in his bathrobe watching TV

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.389
and giving inaccurate tours
of the Oval Office.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:24.424
He told one visitor
that the office's golden drapes

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:27.528
were used by FDR, but they were
actually made for Bill Clinton.

00:00:27.561 --> 00:00:29.596
And that should be
really easy to remember,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.965
'cause they threw out
all the White House fabrics

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:33.634
-after Clinton.
-(laughter)

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:36.136
-Got rid of 'em.
-Oh! -Ugh!

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.838
It's like, "Get out.
Just burn these.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.540
-Just burn these."
-Ugh! -(applause)

00:00:39.573 --> 00:00:40.908
Burn these.

00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:44.077
Of course, Trump said the
article was just lies, tweeting,

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:46.680
"The failing @nytimes writes
total fiction concerning me.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.849
"They have gotten it wrong
for two years,

00:00:48.882 --> 00:00:50.384
and now they're making up
stories and sources!"

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:52.953
And then he went back
to watching Fox News

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:55.088
-on a TV George Washington
built. -(laughter)

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:58.091
So, comedians, what are some
other fake White House facts

00:00:58.125 --> 00:01:01.361
Donald Trump tells his tours?
Ron Funches.

00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:03.597
All the water fountains
are whites only.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.900
-HARDWICK: All right.
-(laughter and groaning)

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:09.903
-(cheers and applause)
-PUDI: Yeah!

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:13.073
-Yeah!
-HARDWICK: Points.

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:15.008
Mr. Alan Tudyk.

00:01:15.042 --> 00:01:18.912
The Lincoln bedroom is named
after our greatest president,

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:20.747
-President Bedroom.
-Yeah!

00:01:20.781 --> 00:01:22.182
HARDWICK:
Yes. Very good. Points.

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:24.518
-(cheers and applause)
-HARDWICK: But that one's true.

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:24.618
-I think that one's true.
-Fact. -That one is true.
