00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.260
Right now, the prevailing theory
of how the universe came about

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.015
is commonly called
the Big Bang theory.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.090
And really is just this idea
that the universe started

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:17.610
as kind of this infinitely
small point, this infinitely

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.590
small singularity.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.090
And then it just had a big
bang or it just expanded

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.000
from that state to the universe
that we know right now.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.120
And when I first
imagined this-- and I

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.500
think if it's also a byproduct
of how it's named-- Big Bang,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.440
you kind of imagine
this type of explosion,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.310
that everything was
infinitely packed in together

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.070
and then it exploded.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.620
And then it exploded outward.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.670
And then as all of the
matter exploded outward,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.750
it started to condense.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.450
And then you have
these little galaxies

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.772
and super clusters of galaxies.

00:00:53.772 --> 00:00:54.980
And they started to condense.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.830
And then within them, planets
condensed and stars condensed.

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.480
And then we have
the type of universe

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.760
that we have right now.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.220
But this model for
visualizing the Big Bang

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.330
has a couple of problems.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.940
One is when we talk
about the Big Bang,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.590
we're not talking about the
matter, just the mass or just

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.810
the matter in the universe
being in one point.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.790
We're talking about
actual space expanding.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.630
So we're not just talking about
something inside of space,

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.920
like the physical mass, the
physical matter expanding.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.870
We're talking
about space itself.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.559
And so when you have
this type of model,

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:29.100
you have all of this
stuff expanding.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.641
But you're like,
whoa, look, isn't it

00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:32.590
expanding into something else?

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.080
Maybe if the furthest
out parts of this matter

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.730
is right over here, what's
this stuff over here?

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.530
And so you say, well,
wouldn't that be space?

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.590
So how can you say space
itself is expanding?

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.270
And another idea
that a Big Bang also

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.480
implies is if this is the
furthest stuff out there,

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.690
would this be the
edge of the universe?

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.500
Does the universe have an edge?

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.772
And the answer to either
of those questions,

00:02:00.772 --> 00:02:02.980
and that's what we're going
to try to tackle in this,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.810
is that, one, the universe
does not have an edge.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.080
And two, there is
no outside space.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.140
We are not expanding
into another space.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.390
And I'm going to explain that.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.140
Hopefully, we'll see why
that is the case right now.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.730
So the best way to
view it-- and we're

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.380
going to view it by analogy.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:31.020
If I were tell you that I have
a two-dimensional space that

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.600
has a finite area, so
it has a finite area--

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.970
so it's not infinite.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.925
And it also has no edge.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.150
This once again, when you first
look at it, seems difficult.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.060
How do I just
construct something

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.470
that has a finite area,
but still has no edge?

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.230
Every time I try
to draw an area,

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.430
it looks like I have
to have some edges.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.340
And then you might
remember, what

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.775
if that two-dimensional space
is curved, what happens?

00:03:00.775 --> 00:03:02.730
And I think the
easiest example of that

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.250
is the surface of a sphere.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.310
Let me draw a sphere over here.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.690
So this right here is a sphere.

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.440
Let me draw some
longitude and latitudinal

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.300
lines on this sphere.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.050
On this sphere, all
of a sudden-- and I'll

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.425
shade it in a
little bit, make it

00:03:21.425 --> 00:03:25.989
look nice-- this type of a
sphere, you have a finite area.

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.780
You could imagine the
surface of a balloon,

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.610
or the surface of a bubble,
or the surface of the Earth.

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.350
You have a finite area,
but you have no edge.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.410
If you keep going
forever in one direction,

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.980
you're going to go all the
way around and come back

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.330
to the other side.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.350
Now, to imagine a
three-dimensional space

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:50.887
that has these same
properties, a finite area

00:03:50.887 --> 00:03:52.970
and-- and I don't want to
say finite area anymore,

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.386
because we're not talking about
a three-dimensional space.

00:03:55.386 --> 00:03:56.610
Let me draw it over here.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.220
So let's think about a
three-dimensional space, so

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:07.530
a three-dimensional space.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.250
Instead of area, since we're
in three dimensions now,

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:20.649
I want to talk about a
finite volume and no edge.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:21.464
How do I do that?

00:04:21.464 --> 00:04:23.214
And when you think
about it superficially,

00:04:23.214 --> 00:04:25.600
well, look, if I
have a finite volume,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.180
maybe it'll be contained
in some type of a cube.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.216
And then we clearly have
edges in those situations.

00:04:32.216 --> 00:04:34.090
Or you could even think
about a finite volume

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.530
as being the inside of a sphere.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.459
And that clearly has an edge,
this entire surface over there.

00:04:39.459 --> 00:04:41.500
So how do you construct
a three-dimensional space

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.590
that has a finite
volume and no edge?

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.380
And that I'm going to
tell you right now,

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.516
it's very hard for
us to visualize it.

00:04:48.516 --> 00:04:49.890
But in order to
visualize it, I'm

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.556
essentially going to
draw the same thing

00:04:51.556 --> 00:04:52.560
as I drew right here.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.940
What you have to
imagine, and you almost

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.990
have to imagine it by
analogy, unless you

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.700
have some type of a
profound brain wired

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:06.080
for more than three spatial
dimensions, is a sphere.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.844
So let me make it clear.

00:05:08.844 --> 00:05:10.260
This is a
two-dimensional surface.

00:05:15.745 --> 00:05:17.120
On the surface of
the sphere, you

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.740
can only move into directions,
two perpendicular directions.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.350
You could move like that or
you could move like that.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.850
You could move left and right
or you could move up and down.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.340
So it's a
two-dimensional surface

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.960
of a three-dimensional sphere.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.766
So if we take it by
analogy, let's imagine,

00:05:38.766 --> 00:05:42.006
and it's hard to imagine, a
three-dimensional surface.

00:05:45.116 --> 00:05:46.490
And you can do it
mathematically.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.790
The math here is actually
not that difficult.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.970
It's a three-dimensional surface
of a four-dimensional sphere.

00:06:00.807 --> 00:06:02.390
And I'm going to
draw it the same way.

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:04.223
So if we kind of view
those three dimensions

00:06:04.223 --> 00:06:07.960
are just these two dimensions
of the surface, the same thing.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.005
It's the same thing.

00:06:09.005 --> 00:06:10.380
And if you imagine
that-- I'm not

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.671
saying that this is actually
the shape of the universe.

00:06:12.671 --> 00:06:15.020
We don't know the actual shape.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.800
But we do know that it does
have a slight curvature.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.709
We don't know the actual shape,
but a sphere is the simplest.

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:22.000
There's other ones we could do.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.860
A toroid would also fit the
bill of having a finite volume

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.402
with no edge.

00:06:26.402 --> 00:06:28.193
And another thing, I
want to make it clear,

00:06:28.193 --> 00:06:29.910
we actually don't
even know whether it

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:31.331
has just a finite volume.

00:06:31.331 --> 00:06:32.580
That's still an open question.

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.070
But what I want
to do is show you

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:38.460
that it can have a finite
volume and also have no edge.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.350
And most people believe-- and
I want to say "believe" here

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.740
because we can just go
based on evidence and all

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.500
that-- that we are talking about
something with a finite volume,

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.300
especially when you talk
about the Big Bang theory.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:56.750
That kind of, on some dimension,
implies a finite volume,

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.600
although it could be a super
large, unfathomably large

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.520
volume, it is finite.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.380
Now, if you have this,
let's imagine this sphere.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.800
Let's imagine this sphere.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.670
Once again, if you're
on this surface

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:11.070
of this four-dimensional
sphere--

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.110
I obviously can not draw
a four-dimensional sphere.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.650
But if you're on the surface of
this four-dimensional sphere,

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:20.960
if you go in any direction,
you'll come back out

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.680
and come back to
where you started.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:25.405
If you go that way, you'll
come back around here.

00:07:25.405 --> 00:07:26.780
Now, the universe is super huge.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.150
So even light,
maybe light itself

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.160
will take an unbelievable
amount of time to traverse it.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.570
And if this sphere
itself is expanding,

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.120
it might be expanding so fast
that light might not ever

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.580
be able to come back around it.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.820
But in theory, if
something were fast enough,

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.860
if something were to
keep going around,

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.250
it could eventually
go back to this point.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.770
Now, when we talk about a
three-dimensional surface--

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.630
it's a three-dimensional surface
of a four-dimensional sphere--

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.310
that means that any of the
three dimensions-- over here,

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.810
on the surface, I
can only draw two.

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:01.410
But that means if this is
true, if the universe is

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:06.060
a three-dimensional surface of
a four-dimensional sphere, that

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.820
means that if you go up
and you just keep going up,

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:12.030
you'll eventually come
back from the bottom.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:16.500
So if you keep going
all the way up,

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.990
you'll eventually come back
to the point that you were.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:20.930
It might be an unbelievably
large distance,

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.560
but you'll eventually
get back where you were.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.370
If you go to the right,
you'll eventually

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.020
come back all the way around
to the point where you were.

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.710
And if you were to
go into the page--

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.400
so if you were to
go into the page--

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.909
let me draw it that way--
if you go into the page,

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:36.789
you would eventually come
back from above the page

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:38.740
and come back to the
point that you are.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.000
So that's what this
implication would be.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.360
That you would eventually
get back to where you are.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.730
So let's go back to the question
of an expanding universe,

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.030
a expanding universe that's not
expanding into any other space.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.300
That is all of the space,
but it's still expanding.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.440
Well, this is the model.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:57.720
So you could imagine
shortly after the Big Bang,

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.590
our four-dimensional
sphere looked like this.

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:05.780
Maybe it was a little small
four-dimensional sphere.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.470
Maybe right at the
Big Bang, it was

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.460
like this little
unbelievably small sphere.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:12.080
Then a little bit later,
it's this larger sphere.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.494
Let me just shade
it in to show you

00:09:15.494 --> 00:09:18.160
that it's kind of popping out of
the page, that's it's a sphere.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.840
And then at a later time, the
sphere might look like this.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.170
The sphere might look like this.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.000
Now, your temptation
might be to say, wait,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.160
Sal, isn't this stuff
outside of this sphere,

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.630
isn't that some type of a
space that it's expanding into?

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.470
Isn't that somehow
part of the universe?

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:40.550
And I would say if you're
talking in three dimensions,

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.400
no, it's not.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.620
The entire universe
is this surface.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.930
It is this surface of this
four-dimensional sphere.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.880
If you start talking
about more dimensions,

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.970
then, yes, you could talk
about maybe things outside

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.450
of our three-dimensional
universe.

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:59.150
So as this expands
in space/time--

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.230
so one way to view
the fourth dimension

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:03.550
is it is time itself--
things are just

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.307
getting further
and further apart.

00:10:05.307 --> 00:10:07.390
And I'll talk about more
evidence in future videos

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:11.930
for why the Big Bang is the best
theory we have out there right

00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:12.550
now.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:14.270
But as you could
imagine, if you have

00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:17.200
two points on this sphere
that are that far apart,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.690
as this sphere expands, this
four-dimensional sphere, as

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:23.040
this bubble blows up or
this balloon blows up,

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.485
those two points are just--
let me draw three points.

00:10:25.485 --> 00:10:26.860
Let's say those
are three points.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.235
Those three points
are just going

00:10:28.235 --> 00:10:30.520
to get further
and further apart.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:35.174
And that's actually one of
the main points that-- or one

00:10:35.174 --> 00:10:37.840
of the first reasons why it made
sense to believe the Big Bang--

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.920
is that everything is expanding,
not from some central point.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.385
But everything is
expanding from everything.

00:10:43.385 --> 00:10:46.010
That if you go in any direction
from any point in the universe,

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:47.240
everything else
is expanding away.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.781
And the further away
you go, it looks

00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:52.041
like the faster it's
expanding away from you.

00:10:52.041 --> 00:10:53.790
So I'll leave you
there, something for you

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:55.681
to kind of think
about a little bit.

00:10:55.681 --> 00:10:57.180
And then we'll build
on some of this

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.570
to think about what it
means to kind of observe

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.780
the observable universe.
