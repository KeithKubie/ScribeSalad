00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:11.490
While being famous may seem like a blessing,
it has a lot of drawbacks.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.150
Constant public attention and media scrutiny
is not an easy thing to deal with, and it

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.570
makes it almost impossible to have a normal
life.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.470
Even when they’re not working, actors are
still on the clock.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.080
With their careers constantly in flux, the
slightest action could change everything.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.080
The movies can be a surprisingly fickle business.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.249
In an industry where things are so fluid,
a performer can go from zero to hero overnight,

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:31.880
but unfortunately, the opposite is also true.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.420
So wether it’s because of their careers,
sketchy personal lives, or simply falling

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:43.240
victim to the Hollywood machine, here are
10 Actors Who Have Aged In Shocking Ways.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.500
Macaulay Culkin
One of the cutest kids to ever appear on screen,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.850
Macaulay Culkin’s most iconic work is enjoyable
to this day.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.600
When the holidays come around, people order
themselves an extra cheese pizza, make an

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.640
ice cream sundae, and turn on 1990’s Home
Alone.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.070
Watching Kevin McCallister defend his homestead
against two idiot burglars is a timeless experience.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.970
One made even better by 9 year-old Culkin’s
performance.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.660
After the movie’s success, his star began
to rise.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.969
And quickly the actor was making millions
of dollars per movie.

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:13.859
Dollars which were handled by his parents.

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:17.770
Familial turmoil proved overwhelming, and
the young performer ended up leaving the business

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.560
until things were sorted out.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.740
After a legal battle where both parents felt
entitled to their child’s money, Culkin

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:22.740
separated himself (and his money) completely.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.810
He’s since returned to acting, and plays
in a band called The Pizza Underground.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.090
Wesley Snipes
Wesley Snipes has a bad attitude toward authority,

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.939
and for years that’s part of what’s made
him successful.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.690
When he shows up on screen, odds are, he’s
there to kick multiple asses.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.679
In fact, he’s so good at kicking asses that
he was chosen to play the big-screen adaptation

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:44.850
of Blade, a character who only exists to kick
asses.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.859
But, fans did experience an interruption in
an otherwise consistent stream of ass kicking.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.630
When the actor’s distain for authority landed
him in some trouble with the IRS.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.909
He spent three years in jail for tax evasion.

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.909
Ouch.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.719
Mel Gibson
If you took a time machine back to the early

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.959
nineties, you couldn’t find a more in-demand
actor than Mel Gibson.

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.620
If you were to tell someone that in the future
the actor would be abandoned by his agency,

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.480
they’d look at you like you were nuts..
but you wouldn’t be wrong.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.730
He was a Hollywood powerhouse making moves
on screen and off, and has the Academy Awards

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.390
from Braveheart to prove it.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.450
But rumors about Gibson began to spread years
later, and after a few voicemails found their

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.660
way to the internet, a lot of those rumors
were proven.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.660
Lots of activist groups had some choice words
for the actor.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.450
He offended a lot of people in a short timeframe.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.940
And earned him a reputation as a racist, a
misogynist, or all of the above.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.400
Shia LaBeouf
Shia LaBeouf was the best part of Even Stevens,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.380
a show that ran for three seasons on the Disney
channel in the early 2000’s.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.440
And while the network continues to pump out
superstars, it’s also a commonality in many

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.950
stories of wholesome young performers gone
wild.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.990
But that wouldn’t happen to Shia, right?

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.990
Wrong.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.240
The actor enjoyed massive success after working
hard in the years after Louis Stevens, and

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.180
became the face of Michael Bay’s Transformers
franchise reboot.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.930
But beginning with a DUI arrest in 2008, his
public persona started to change in a big

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.930
way.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.760
The actor was called out for plagiarizing
work by writer Daniel Clowes, and then responded

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.700
to the backlash with a plagiarized apology.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.530
He’s still acting, just mostly in memes.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.710
Winona Ryder
Winona Ryder has been working since the late

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.810
eighties, and has been part of legendary movies
in the process.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.980
From Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands,
to Reality Bites and Girl, Interrupted, the

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.570
actress proved that she could hop between
genres with ease.

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.880
Longevity is not something a lot of actresses
experience, and Hollywood is often accused

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.140
of being harder on women than they are on
men.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.540
So while she may have been untouchable as
a performer, as a human she was fair game.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.780
And when she was busted for shoplifting in
2001, the media ran with it.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.460
Recently the actress acknowledged the incident
and asserted that the whole thing was blown

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.480
out of proportion.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.990
She never strayed too far from the big screen
though, and recently teamed up with Netflix

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.220
for the enormously successful Stranger Things.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.430
Chevy Chase
As one of the original cast members of Saturday

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.319
Night Live, Chevy Chase has got some serious
bragging rights.

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.850
And he’s one of the O.G’s of comedy.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.920
So when Dan Harmon was looking for an older
actor to play a community college curmudgeon

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.550
for his T.V. show, Chase was the right choice.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.940
The show had it’s highs and lows but gained
a loyal fanbase thanks to it’s quirky style.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.950
Everyone was having a blast on set, except
for Chase.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.090
He and Harmon clashed when it came to defining
what is (and isn’t) funny.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.880
After the actor left an angry voicemail for
Harmon, it was leaked onto the internet.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.590
That, coupled with reports of him using racial
epithets on set, ultimately led to his character

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.130
Pierce being scaled way back in the series.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.350
And the stigma has followed him since.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.470
Amanda Bynes,
Since the beginning of her career, Amanda

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.980
Bynes has proven that girls can be hilarious.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:52.750
Starting out on Niclekodeon’s sketch comedy
show All That, she climbed the ladder all

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.090
the way to feature films.

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.940
And even though the actress was unbelievable
in She’s The Man, the majority of audiences

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.750
will recognize her from the 2007 film adaptation
of Hairspray.

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.240
The starlet retired from acting in 2010, but
stayed in the public eye because of some erratic

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.120
behavior, and a string of tweets.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.760
In 2012, Bynes was arrested numerous times
and charged with DUIs among other things.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.500
Fans watched as the actress took her rants
to Twitter, prompting a few professionals

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.500
to intervene.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.850
She’s now enrolled in fashion school, and
recently spoken about how she received the

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:23.820
help she needed.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.630
Lindsay Lohan
If you were around in the nineties, you probably

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.710
remember the 1998 remake of The Parent Trap.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.070
Where two identically adorable kids conspire
to reunite their parents.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.760
And that’s when the world met little Lindsay
Lohan, who played both of the movie’s freckled

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.050
twins.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.760
Audiences were surprised that such a young
kid could do double duty.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.780
Especially when most singular kids roles actually
require twins.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.780
When strict on-set schooling guidelines clash
with the pace of filmmaking, frankly it’s

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:49.780
easier to swap them out.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.660
Lohan was quick to make her newfound Hollywood
cred work for her, and landed a role that

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.800
catapulted her to stardom in 2004’s Mean
Girls.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.150
But as the years went on, her talent was overshadowed
by some personal drama.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.169
And while she’s continued to do some acting
work since, her earlier success has never

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:06.250
been replicated.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.160
Johnny Depp
Viewers were introduced to Johnny Depp in

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.470
a little show called 21 Jump Street.

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.310
And after he asked to be fired, the actor
took a hard left into a career that would

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.280
take him as far away from his wholesome image
as possible.

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.669
The actor showed off his range in the years
to come, and that earned him points will all

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:23.900
kinds of moviegoers.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.410
From Edward Scissorhands to Benny &amp; Joon to
Donnie Brasco, Depp’s work was all over

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:29.410
the map.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.730
And then in 2003, Pirates of the Caribbean
happened.

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:36.500
Beginning with Captain Jack Sparrow, Depp’s
opponents argue all his roles began to bleed

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.400
into one: a quirky guy with a quirkier hat.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.040
And that the only thing on display now is
his wasted talent.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.460
Gwyneth Paltrow
You wouldn’t know it by her reputation today,

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.270
but Gwyneth Paltrow used to be one of America’s
sweethearts.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.140
The actress has quite the range, too.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.150
She was adorable as young Wendy in 1991’s
Hook.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.090
She even got to be the head in the box at
the end of Se7en.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:06.520
(“WHATS IN THE BOXXXXX”) But since her
Oscar win for 1998’s Shakespeare In Love,

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.300
she slowly began to lose favor with audiences.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.310
The actress is a vocal supporter of a very
specific type of diet and lifestyle.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.490
Which, for a lot of people, is far too pricey
to commit to.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:20.490
She also made moms everywhere shake with rage
when she insisted that parenting was easy

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.180
for them, but hard for her, and never acknowledged
the disparity in that statement.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:29.180
It seems like the more public her personal
life gets, the less audiences like her.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.020
What do you think of our list?

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.600
Did we miss any actors whose careers aged
horribly?
