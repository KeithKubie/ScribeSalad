00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.870
The value of the limit
as x approaches 0 of 1

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.490
over x to the third times
the definite integral from 0

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.890
to x of t natural
log of 1 plus t, all

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.530
of that over t to the
fourth plus 4dt is.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.830
Now, when you see an
integral like this,

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.170
you're first temptation is
to try to solve the integral,

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.770
try to find the antiderivative
of this expression here.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.320
And you might try to experiment
maybe with inverse trig

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.120
functions, maybe arctangent
looks tempting over here.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.700
But you have this natural log.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.970
Maybe you can do it with
integration by parts.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.460
But very quickly, or
maybe not so very quickly,

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.490
you'll realize that this is
a nearly impossible integral

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.170
to simply solve using
analytical methods.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.890
But, lucky for us,
this problem isn't just

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.130
about solving this integral.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.010
It's actually about
evaluating this a limit.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.410
And if we rearrange this
expression a little bit,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.120
it might become a
little obvious to you

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.910
how we can approach
this problem.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.992
So this is the limit
as x approaches 0 of.

00:01:02.992 --> 00:01:04.450
Let me write this
in the numerator,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.269
because this is could be
multiplying by 1 over x

00:01:07.269 --> 00:01:09.810
to the third is the same thing
as dividing by x to the third.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.050
So this is the integral from
0 to x of t natural log of 1

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.900
plus t, all of that over
t to the fourth plus 4dt.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.810
And all of that
over x to the third.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.660
And now, this is
probably ringing bells

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.220
in some of your brains.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.290
And what we see here
is we don't know

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.620
how to evaluate this
integral over here.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.390
But what does this integral
approach as x approaches 0?

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.270
What is the limit of
this numerator expression

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.340
as it approaches 0?

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.340
So let me just write it.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.910
The limit as it
approaches 0, so the limit

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:57.490
as x approaches 0 of 0 to x,
all of that stuff inside dt

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.892
is going to equal
the integral from 0.

00:01:59.892 --> 00:02:01.350
It's going to
approach the integral

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.950
from 0 to 0 of that stuff dt.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.310
And a definite
integral from 0 to 0,

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.810
we're not moving at all along
the horizontal or the t axis.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.552
And so, this is
just going to be 0.

00:02:14.552 --> 00:02:16.510
And if we do the same
thing in the denominator,

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.343
that's much simpler.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.850
The limit as x approaches
0 of x to the third, that's

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.600
clearly also going to be 0.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.860
So we took the limits of the
numerator and denominator

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.710
and we got 0/0.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.460
That's the indeterminate form.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:37.740
And so now the bells should
be ringing very loudly

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.170
in your brain and
screaming L'Hopital's rule.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.840
And I've done several videos on
this in the calculus playlist.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.880
But this just tells
us if we evaluate

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.860
the limit of the
numerator as it approaches

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.420
0 and the limit of the
denominator approaches 0,

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.490
and we get an
indeterminate form,

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.150
then this limit is going
to be the exact same thing,

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.400
assuming the limit
exist, of the limit

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.190
as x approaches 0 of the
derivative of this expression

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.867
over the derivative
of this expression.

00:03:08.867 --> 00:03:11.200
Now let's do the denominator
first, since that's easier.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.350
What's the derivative
of x to the third?

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.930
Well, that's just 3x squared.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.680
And what's the derivative
of the numerator?

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.180
And just as a
reminder, and I'm just

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.950
going to break out the
fundamental theorem

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:22.530
of calculus.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.780
The derivative with respect
to x from some constant to x

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.400
of f of t dt is just
equal to f of x.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.170
You're undoing the
integration here.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.230
You just get f of x, it's just
the function with respect to x.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.440
So the derivative of
this with respect to x

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.900
is just going to be this
function with respect

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.030
to x instead of t.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.780
So it's going to be
x natural log-- that

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.310
was an ugly natural
log-- of 1 plus x,

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.230
all of that over x
to the fourth plus 4.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.750
Now, when we try to evaluate
the limit here, what happens?

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.510
If we do the numerator, if we do
the same thing we did up here,

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.300
this numerator still
evaluates to 0.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.010
You get 0 times
natural log of 1.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.940
That's 0 as well.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.260
So that's all 0.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.950
The denominator
still evaluates to 0.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.060
So we have indeterminate
form again.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.110
So we might be tempted to just
go straight, do L'Hopital's

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.700
rule again, take the
derivative of the numerator

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.700
and then take the derivative
of the denominator.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:26.570
And that would work.

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.320
Or maybe you'll see that
this is a pretty hairy thing

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.530
to take a derivative of.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.113
And maybe we might have to take
a derivative again after that.

00:04:33.113 --> 00:04:35.800
So this could get
very, very, very hairy.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.510
So, instead of just
straight up just

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.210
taking a derivative of the
numerator and derivative

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.668
of the denominator
again, let's see

00:04:40.668 --> 00:04:42.560
if we can simplify
this a little bit.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.720
And we can.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.960
So this is the same thing.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.062
This is equal to the
limit as x approaches 0.

00:04:48.062 --> 00:04:49.770
I'm just going to put
the x to the fourth

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.970
plus 4 in the denominator.

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.640
So it's x natural log of 1 plus
x, all of that over this 3x

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.400
squared.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.134
And if I'm dividing by something
and dividing by something else,

00:05:03.134 --> 00:05:05.050
that's just like dividing
by that first thing.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:08.190
So this is x to
the fourth plus 4.

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.870
I just put this in
the denominator,

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.340
and we can simplify this.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.760
We can divide the numerator
and denominator by x.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.600
And now, let's try to
evaluate this limit.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.120
As x approaches 0
in the numerator,

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.410
we get natural log of 1.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.820
So that's 0.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.702
So this is approaching 0 over.

00:05:23.702 --> 00:05:25.160
And if we do it in
the denominator,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.280
we have 3 times 0 times 4.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.700
So that's going to be 0.

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.660
Once again, indeterminate form.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.830
So now let's apply
L'Hopital's rule again.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.070
But we can apply it on
a simpler expression,

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.460
on natural log of 1
plus x over 3x times x

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.150
to the fourth plus 4.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.050
So let's do that.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.700
So this is going to be
equal to, assuming the limit

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.770
exists, this is
equal to the limit

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.120
as x approaches 0 of the
derivative of the numerator.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.530
The derivative of natural log of
1 plus x, that's just 1 over 1

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.810
plus x over the derivative
of the denominator.

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.730
We just have to do a
little product rule here.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:03.970
Derivative of the first
function is derivative of 3x

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.290
is just 3 times the
second function, which

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:13.260
is x to the fourth plus 4 plus
the first function, 3x, it's

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.070
just the product rule,
times the derivative

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.180
of the second function.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.690
The derivative of this
is 4x to the third.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.180
Now, when we approach 0,
what happens to this value?

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.120
What is the numerator and
the denominator approach?

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.850
The numerator approaches 1
over 1 plus 0, or just 1.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:36.440
The denominator
approaches 3 times 0

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.700
plus 4 plus this is
going to be 0, plus 0.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.630
So this is equal to 1/12.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:46.240
And we're done.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.550
This crazy looking
limit with this integral

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:55.030
that we couldn't solve
is just equal to 1/12.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.480
So thank goodness we
had L'Hopital's rule

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.170
so we didn't have
to actually take

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:04.660
the antiderivative
of this expression.
