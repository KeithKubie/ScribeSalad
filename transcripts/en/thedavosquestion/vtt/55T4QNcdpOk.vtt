&gt;&gt; Hi this is Bill Baldwin. I'm answering
the question should businessmen have a code

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:12.570
of ethics that they have to answer to. I'm
wondering whether any dishonest executive

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.130
would be made more honest by having a code.
I remember the last time there was a round

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.510
of corporate chicanery. What we got was a
lot of expensive instruction in business ethics

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.820
at business schools and that didn't make businessmen
any more honest.
