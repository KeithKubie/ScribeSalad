00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.480
There's a stereotype floating around out there
that the poor are more likely to steal and

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.480
lie.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.410
But the science reveals, that stereotype couldn't
be further from the truth.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.400
Hey friends, Laci Green here for Dnews.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.630
In the past few years there's been a lot of
hubbub about the wealth gap and income inequality

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.760
and the one percent.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.399
Scientists are asking, what are the real differences
between the behavior the rich and the poor?

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:32.040
30 studies have been conducted so far on wealth
and behavior and the results are pretty intense

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.040
actually.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.040
Prepare yourselves.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.841
Across the US, no matter what your political
background or where you live, the rich are

00:00:37.841 --> 00:00:43.630
consistently more likely to cheat, lie, steal,
and be kind of terrible to other people.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.370
One of the studies published in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences looked

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.460
at driving behavior.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.520
They found that those who drive luxury vehicles
were three to four times less likely to stop

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.650
for a pedestrian.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.760
Those in higher status cars would often zoom
through the crosswalk even when they saw that

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.840
a pedestrian was standing there waiting.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.850
While the lower status cars almost always
stopped.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.820
Another study tested lab participants' honesty
in a dice rolling game.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.420
The researchers told participants that if
they made the best dice rolls, they would

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.420
win a prize.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.680
Using a hidden camera, they found that the
participants who made over $150,000 a year

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.640
were four times as likely to cheat than those
who only made $15,000 a year.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.790
Yea the rich participants made about as much
as the poor participants do per month.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.270
And what was the prize?

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.440
Fifty bucks.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.960
Moral of the story here, "don't get rich or
you'll become terrible."

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.210
Or is it that you become rich because you
are already terrible?

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.720
Philosophical question yo.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.210
Another study shed some light here.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.700
It suggests that it's the wealth itself that
taints our minds that drives further greed

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.700
and entitlement.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.220
In this experiment, hundreds in UC Berkeley
students were paired up to play a round of

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.680
Monopoly with each other,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.680
with a catch.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.990
The students were randomly assigned, based
on a dice roll, to be rich or poor.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.040
The rich players started out with two thousand
more and they got to roll two dice.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.430
The poor player got no pay advantage and they
could only roll with one die.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.970
So the game was rigged for rich player to
win, no matter what happened.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.219
But after the game, these unassuming innocent
students who merely played rich, said that

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:14.730
they deserved to win.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.900
Girl you won because the dice landed in your
favor at the beginning of the game!

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.049
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.079
You know what I'm saying.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.329
So these studies aren't necessarily groundbreaking.

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:26.730
There were other studies that found upper-income
folks are more likely to shoplift.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.470
A study in Psychological Science found lower
empathetic accuracy in wealthy participants

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.809
compared to the poor and uneducated.

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:37.040
The poor also give a higher percentage of
their money to charity than the rich do.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.219
I don't know, it kinda makes me have all these
weird feelings about money and stuff.

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.180
I mean what does it all mean?

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.419
Let me know what you guys think down below
and I'll be sure to link some further reading

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:48.400
in the description if you're interested in
that kinda thing.
