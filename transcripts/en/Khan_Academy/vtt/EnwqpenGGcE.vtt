00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.660
- [Narrator] During the Gilded Age,

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.940
the population of the
United States had started

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.880
to shift sharply towards living in urban

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.120
rather than rural environments.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.770
In 1900, 1/3 of the American
population lived in cities,

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.020
drawn by the wide
availability of factory jobs.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.070
But by 1920, the scales finally tipped,

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.190
and for the first time the majority

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.870
of people in the United
States lived in cities.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.900
It was the beginning of a new modern era.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.560
We've talked in other videos about

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.620
the economic opportunities
that the cities provided

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.330
for both international
immigrants and internal migrants,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.670
like the half a million African Americans

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.760
who left the South in the
years surrounding World War I

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.640
in search of a better life in the North.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.540
Although factory jobs were subject

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.180
to dangerous working
conditions and wages were low,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.060
for both immigrants and
Southern African Americans,

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.560
the pay and the standard of living

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.840
was usually an improvement on
their previous circumstances.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.330
The transition to life in
the modern industrial city

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.910
also offered new opportunities for women.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.310
With the rise of big corporations

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.000
doing business across
time zones and countries,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.610
there was an increasing
need for clerical workers,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.780
like secretaries and typists.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.930
White women began to take on these roles.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.630
And by the end of the 1920s,

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.050
about 25% of women
worked outside the home.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.340
Women also began to fill the
ranks in employment categories

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.430
that were beginning to be
defined as female professions,

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.160
like nursing and teaching.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.810
And a growing number of women continued

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.700
to work even after they were married.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.980
These kinds of clerical
jobs were generally closed

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.140
to minority women whose options
for work outside the home

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.850
were limited to domestic
service or agricultural labor,

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.050
although some African American women began

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.770
to train in segregated institutions

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.690
for service in segregated institutions,

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.560
for example, going to
black nursing schools

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.020
in order to work in black hospitals.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.160
The mass production techniques
of the 1920s also meant

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.660
that the price of consumer goods dropped

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.480
so that average people could afford

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.330
to buy appliances and even cars.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.210
People had enough disposable income

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.960
to go to the theater
or to an amusement park

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.970
or to a speakeasy
illegally selling alcohol.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.650
After the prim and proper Progressive Era

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.630
and the trauma of World War I,

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.100
many people embraced a carefree attitude

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.070
of self-fulfillment through
leisure and consumption

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.680
or, in other words, having
fun and buying stuff.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.070
But not everyone was thrilled

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.480
with this new modern era
of diverse city living.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.700
During World War I, an
emphasis on 100% Americanism

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.330
squelched dissenters who
protested against the draft

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.720
or questioned U.S. involvement in the war.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.860
Then, after the Russian Revolution,

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.460
labor strikes and a series of
bombings in 1919 led to fears

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.420
that radical communists were
threatening the country.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.600
These incidents,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.630
combined with the flawed
racial pseudoscience of the day

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.020
that cast all people
other than those descended

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.840
from Northern and Western
Europeans as less evolved,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.030
led to a growing sense among
native-born, white Protestants

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.430
that the country was becoming
less and less American.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.480
In 1915, the Ku Klux Klan
experienced a resurgence

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.890
in the United States that
lasted for about 10 years.

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.600
Unlike the Reconstruction Era KKK,

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.090
in this time period, the Klan
had large membership numbers

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.410
in northern and western cities,

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.930
and they targeted Jews and Catholics,

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.710
many of whom were recent immigrants

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.460
from Southern and Eastern Europe,

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.650
in addition to African Americans.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.840
These fears led to the passage

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.360
of new immigration
restrictions in the 1920s.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.940
In 1921, Congress passed
the Emergency Quota Act,

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.250
which limited the number
of immigrants allowed

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.210
from Europe to 350,000,

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.050
or about a third of
pre-World War I levels.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.190
Then, in 1924, Congress limited
immigration even further

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.680
with the Immigration Restriction Act.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.160
This act set quotas of immigrants

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.270
who could arrive from each nation.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.400
The quotas heavily favored immigrants

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.090
from Northern and Western Europe

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.100
and slashed the numbers of Southern

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.970
and Eastern European immigrants
down to as little as 1%

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.870
of their pre-World War I yearly numbers.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.330
Africans from all countries were limited

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.000
to just 1,000 immigrants per year,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.850
and Asians were completely
barred from entry.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.080
The law did not limit the
immigration of Mexicans

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.300
whom western farmers relied
upon for seasonal labor.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.880
Interestingly, in 1924,
Congress also passed a law

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.000
establishing that all Native Americans

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.320
were now U.S. citizens, although
they often had difficulty

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.550
accessing the rights of
citizenship from reservations.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.770
What do these quotas and efforts

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.730
at defining the racial
makeup of the United States

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.590
tell us about who was considered eligible

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.840
to be part of the American
people in the 1920s?

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.660
As we move forward into talking about

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.800
the Great Depression and World War II,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.330
keep thinking about the ways
that citizenship is defined

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.753
and how that definition changes over time.
