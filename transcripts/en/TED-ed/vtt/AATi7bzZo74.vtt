00:00:05.213 --> 00:00:08.167
I'm really sad to say

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:09.412
that in some ways I think

00:00:09.412 --> 00:00:13.942
the world has become a little harder

00:00:13.942 --> 00:00:15.389
and has become faster.

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.119
The changes in the world,

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.818
like all challenges,

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:23.395
have forced us to become more creative,

00:00:23.395 --> 00:00:28.153
have given us no alternative

00:00:28.153 --> 00:00:30.273
but to become braver,

00:00:30.273 --> 00:00:33.194
so more articulate about our feelings,

00:00:33.194 --> 00:00:35.779
have made things like assertiveness

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:40.072
absolutely obligatory,

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:43.576
calling out what you want absolutely a must,

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:46.898
and really making sure

00:00:46.898 --> 00:00:50.517
that you in some way make your talents known

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:53.595
because those days of kind of people going out

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:55.872
and hunting for talent,

00:00:55.872 --> 00:00:58.256
yes, I'm sure on some level that still happens,

00:00:58.256 --> 00:01:03.024
but it's hard, you really got to hold up a big sign

00:01:03.024 --> 00:01:05.924
and say, "I am really good at what I do,

00:01:05.924 --> 00:01:07.521
and I'm really, really rather wonderful.

00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:08.299
You should look at me

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.620
because I'll be great for your team."

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.866
That is, I think, in a nutshell,

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.595
how the world has changed.
