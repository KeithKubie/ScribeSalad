00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.712
- [Voiceover] Which of
the following functions

00:00:01.712 --> 00:00:04.712
are continuous at x equals three?

00:00:05.598 --> 00:00:07.332
Well, as we said in the previous video,

00:00:07.332 --> 00:00:08.435
in the previous example,

00:00:08.435 --> 00:00:10.277
in order to be continuous at a point,

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:12.875
you at least have to be
defined at that point.

00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:14.523
We saw our definition of continuity,

00:00:14.523 --> 00:00:17.215
f is continuous at a, if and only if,

00:00:17.215 --> 00:00:21.638
the limit of f as x approaches
a is equal to f of a.

00:00:21.638 --> 00:00:23.390
So, over here, in this case,

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.300
we could say that a function is continuous

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.467
at x equals three, so f is
continuous at x equals three,

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.366
if and only if the limit as
x approaches three of f of x,

00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:42.908
is equal to f of three.

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:47.261
Now let's look at this first
function right over here.

00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:49.702
Natural log of x minus three.

00:00:49.702 --> 00:00:52.271
Well, try to evaluate it,
and it's not an f now,

00:00:52.271 --> 00:00:54.830
it's g, try to evaluate g of three.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:57.155
G of three, let me write it here,

00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:01.159
g of three is equal to
the natural log of zero.

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:02.125
Three minus three.

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:03.472
This is not defined.

00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:06.856
You can't raise e to any
power to get to zero.

00:01:06.856 --> 00:01:09.392
You can try to go to, you
could say, negative infinity,

00:01:09.392 --> 00:01:11.489
but that's not, this is not defined.

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:14.801
And so, if this isn't even
defined at x equals three,

00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:16.607
there's no way that it's
going to be continuous

00:01:16.607 --> 00:01:20.774
at x equals three, so we
could rule this one out.

00:01:21.686 --> 00:01:24.493
Now f of x is equal to
e to the x minus three.

00:01:24.493 --> 00:01:27.053
Well this is just a shifted
over version of e to the x.

00:01:27.053 --> 00:01:30.181
This is defined for all real numbers,

00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:32.618
and as we saw in the previous example,

00:01:32.618 --> 00:01:35.550
it's reasonable to say it's
continuous for all real numbers,

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.071
and you could even do
this little test here.

00:01:38.071 --> 00:01:41.990
The limit of e to the x minus
three as x approaches three,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.756
well that is going to
be, that is going to be

00:01:43.756 --> 00:01:46.994
e to the three minus three,
or e to the zero, or one.

00:01:46.994 --> 00:01:50.661
And so f is the only
one that is continuous.

00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:53.610
And once again, it's good to think about

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.961
what's going on here
visually, if you like.

00:01:56.961 --> 00:01:58.752
Both of these are, you
could think of them,

00:01:58.752 --> 00:02:00.796
this is a shifted over version of ln of x,

00:02:00.796 --> 00:02:04.211
this is a shifted over
version of e to the x,

00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:08.132
and so if we like, we could
draw ourselves some axes,

00:02:08.132 --> 00:02:11.549
so that's our y-axis, this is our x-axis,

00:02:16.114 --> 00:02:17.441
and actually, let me
draw some points here.

00:02:17.441 --> 00:02:21.358
So that's one, that is
one, that is two, three,

00:02:24.571 --> 00:02:27.071
two, and three, and let's see,

00:02:29.765 --> 00:02:32.080
I said these are shifted over versions,

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.276
so actually, this is maybe
not the best way to draw it,

00:02:35.276 --> 00:02:38.859
so let me draw it, this
is one, two, three,

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.467
four, five, and six.

00:02:44.636 --> 00:02:46.723
And on this axis, I won't
make 'em on the same scale,

00:02:46.723 --> 00:02:49.556
let's say this is one, two, three.

00:02:50.394 --> 00:02:52.073
I'm gonna draw one, two, three,

00:02:52.073 --> 00:02:55.398
I'm gonna draw a dotted
line right over here.

00:02:55.398 --> 00:02:58.745
So g of x, ln of x minus three

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:00.282
is gonna look something like this.

00:03:00.282 --> 00:03:01.729
If you put three in it, it's not defined,

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:04.099
if you put four in it, ln of four,

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.177
well, that's gonna, sorry,
ln of four minus one,

00:03:07.177 --> 00:03:10.677
so that's gonna be ln of four minus three,

00:03:12.015 --> 00:03:14.890
is actually let me just draw a table here,

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.845
I know I'm confusing you.

00:03:16.845 --> 00:03:19.762
So, if I say x and I say g of x,

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:23.359
so at three, you're undefined.

00:03:24.982 --> 00:03:28.149
At four, this is ln of one, ln of one,

00:03:30.584 --> 00:03:33.925
which is equal to zero,
so it's right over there.

00:03:33.925 --> 00:03:38.092
So g of x is gonna look something
like, something like that.

00:03:40.213 --> 00:03:41.937
And so you can see at three,

00:03:41.937 --> 00:03:44.674
you have this discontinuity there,

00:03:44.674 --> 00:03:46.964
it's not even defined
to the left of three.

00:03:46.964 --> 00:03:50.318
Now f of x is a little
bit more straightforward.

00:03:50.318 --> 00:03:54.151
If you have, so e to the
three is going to be,

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.181
sorry, f of three is going to
be e to the three minus three,

00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:03.751
or e to the zero, so it's going to be one,

00:04:03.751 --> 00:04:06.525
so it's gonna look something like this,

00:04:06.525 --> 00:04:09.138
it's gonna look something,

00:04:09.138 --> 00:04:11.305
something like, like that.

00:04:12.755 --> 00:04:14.498
There's no jumps, there's no gaps,

00:04:14.498 --> 00:04:17.148
it is going to be continuous, and frankly,

00:04:17.148 --> 00:04:18.743
all real numbers so for sure it's going

00:04:18.743 --> 00:04:20.872
to be continuous at three.
