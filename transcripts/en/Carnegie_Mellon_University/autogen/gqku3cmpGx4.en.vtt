so Randy wasn't just a professor at

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840
so Randy wasn't just a professor at
 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.570
so Randy wasn't just a professor at
Carnegie Mellon he was also a student

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580
Carnegie Mellon he was also a student
 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.900
Carnegie Mellon he was also a student
there he had a long association with the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910
there he had a long association with the
 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.510
there he had a long association with the
place and I actually got to interact

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520
place and I actually got to interact
 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.370

them because we were grad students at
 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.560
them because we were grad students at
the same time and he was pretty amazing

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570
the same time and he was pretty amazing
 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.840
the same time and he was pretty amazing

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.610
so we'll have a minor dip in the IQ up

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620
so we'll have a minor dip in the IQ up
 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.550
so we'll have a minor dip in the IQ up
