00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.880
So because I was looking for a team and
not someone for a specific task,

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.230
I didn't do any programming
skills tests or

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.730
any other things like that that you
can really quantify the result.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.042
I gave a few companies
the same exact project

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:26.800
that I had ability to evaluate myself.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.740
It was a reporting project.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.756
I wanted them to connect all kinds
of data sources to one dashboard,

00:00:33.756 --> 00:00:36.399
and I told them that's what I need.

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.081
That's the brief, go out and execute it.

00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:41.299
You have 100 hours to do it.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.490
Do whatever you need because one of
the things that was important to me is

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.840
to have also product abilities.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.975
Not just following orders,
it's also to envision what you want,

00:00:54.975 --> 00:00:57.505
what I need them to do and
execute on that,

00:00:57.505 --> 00:01:01.565
because they didn't want to
micromanage them, I can't micromanage.

00:01:01.565 --> 00:01:06.025
So that was a test that he
passed in flying colors.

00:01:06.025 --> 00:01:08.515
It was way better than what I would do.

00:01:08.515 --> 00:01:11.675
And then I know okay,
we're going to work together for

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:15.915
a long time, because this is exactly
what I would expect an employee of mine.

00:01:15.915 --> 00:01:17.565
To do better than what I would do.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.030
To be better at things
that I did in this.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.130
That's why I need you.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.064
I don't need you just to follow orders.

00:01:24.064 --> 00:01:24.959
I need you to think.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.724
I need you to innovate.

00:01:26.724 --> 00:01:29.030
And that was the test.
