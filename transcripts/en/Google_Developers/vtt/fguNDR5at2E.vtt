00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:01.200
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.500
So we're here at Devoxx 2013.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.470
We're back.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.340
And we have the Angular guys.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.760
Igor and Misko, welcome back.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.760
MISKO HIVERY: Thank you.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:10.130
IGOR MINAR: Thank you.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.690
MALE SPEAKER: You guys were
very popular last year.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.280
I think you did even
better this year.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.600
You were all over the place.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.000
You had university
session, three hours,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.970
which will be online.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.780
And I heard good
things about it,

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.510
how you managed
those three hours.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.210
You had a code lab which was
kind of full, lots of people.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.860
IGOR MINAR: The code
lab was awesome.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.080
MALE SPEAKER: And you're
just back from a what

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.640
you think the future of
Angular will be session.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.712
So you liking the
conference so far?

00:00:37.712 --> 00:00:38.920
IGOR MINAR: It's pretty good.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.700
We've always liked Devoxx.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.816
It's great to be here.

00:00:41.816 --> 00:00:44.232
MALE SPEAKER: Well, I think
you had kind of a hockey stick

00:00:44.232 --> 00:00:47.052
thing going on last
year, around Devoxx.

00:00:47.052 --> 00:00:48.260
I'm not sure this is really--

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.262
MISKO HIVERY: We're giving
Devoxx all the credit.

00:00:50.262 --> 00:00:51.106
MALE SPEAKER: OK, OK.

00:00:51.106 --> 00:00:51.606
Great.

00:00:51.606 --> 00:00:54.190
So let's step back for a second.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.480
Angular, for anybody
that's been living

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.400
under a rock for the
past couple years now,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.092
I guess, what are
we talking about?

00:01:02.092 --> 00:01:03.800
IGOR MINAR: We're
talking about framework

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.840
for building client-side
web applications

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.560
with HTML and JavaScript, CSS.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.800
We focus on developer activity
and combining all these web

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.850
technologies into
something that's

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.602
really pleasurable to use and
is also scalable and testable,

00:01:21.602 --> 00:01:23.185
so that you can build
big applications

00:01:23.185 --> 00:01:25.105
or small applications
depending on what you need.

00:01:25.105 --> 00:01:25.530
MALE SPEAKER: Wow.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.530
It's buzzword compliant.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.330
Awesome.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.890
So we're talking MVC
type of framework,

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.220
we're talking data binding.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.095
Do you want to say a
word quickly about that?

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:35.886
MISKO HIVERY: Sure.

00:01:35.886 --> 00:01:38.090
Data binding, it's just a
way for getting the data

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.350
from the heap, memory objects,
into the DOM, and backwards.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.330
MALE SPEAKER: And back.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.670
MISKO HIVERY: And back.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.520
So that it interacts
with the DOM

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.060
through the input
fields, et cetera,

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.890
we update the
memory in response.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.180
MALE SPEAKER: Directive scopes,
other major important concepts?

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.930
MISKO HIVERY: I think
directives is unique

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.097
because it's something
that is unique to us.

00:01:59.097 --> 00:02:00.680
Nobody else has this
particular thing.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.125
And the idea is extending
the vocabulary of HTML.

00:02:05.524 --> 00:02:07.440
MALE SPEAKER: Dependency
injection, one of you

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.330
mentioned that.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.389
That's important.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:11.847
IGOR MINAR: So
dependency injection

00:02:11.847 --> 00:02:14.260
is just a way of
assembling all the objects

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.630
and wiring the
application together,

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.070
which is great because you
don't need to do it by hand

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.960
and also makes the testability
[INAUDIBLE] much better.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.770
MALE SPEAKER: So in the year
that you've had that, I think,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.150
tremendous success, what are
the interesting or surprising

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.780
things you've seen
people do with Angular?

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.010
Has it been taken and
used in unusual places?

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.510
Is it exactly what
you had expected?

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.176
IGOR MINAR: Yes.

00:02:38.176 --> 00:02:39.150
All the time.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.086
We keep on being surprised about
things people do with Angular.

00:02:45.086 --> 00:02:46.830
MISKO HIVERY: Like
putting it in a car.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.400
IGOR MINAR: Put it in a car.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.920
Seeing all kinds
of visual things

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.760
like drawing diagrams
in a declarative way,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.920
taking text and translating
that into diagram.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.671
We've seen slides.

00:02:59.671 --> 00:03:00.503
MISKO HIVERY: Games.

00:03:00.503 --> 00:03:02.956
IGOR MINAR: We've seen
games, mobile applications.

00:03:02.956 --> 00:03:05.256
MISKO HIVERY: Mobile
apps on iPhone.

00:03:05.256 --> 00:03:07.380
MALE SPEAKER: So I hear
here at Devoxx, the actual,

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.010
the thing on the screen is
actually built with Angular?

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.210
MISKO HIVERY: Yes

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.590
IGOR MINAR: Yes.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.412
MALE SPEAKER: So it's
really all over the place.

00:03:12.412 --> 00:03:14.120
IGOR MINAR: When we
started with Angular,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.890
we really meant it to be a
way for building enterprise

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.160
applications, but
people have taken it

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.381
in very different
directions and it's

00:03:22.381 --> 00:03:24.380
surprising to see what
they can do with Angular.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.630
MALE SPEAKER: What you
mentioned in one of the session

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.776
was that you felt really
well about the fact

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:31.400
that people are
actually building stuff

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.175
they weren't able to
build before, or not

00:03:34.175 --> 00:03:35.300
with the same productivity.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.720
So you can actually get
something done in a weekend,

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.800
whereas before it was this
whole scaffolding and dragging

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.310
libraries.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.770
IGOR MINAR: Right.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.980
I mentioned it before,
but it's really nice

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.320
when I talk to people
and they say, hey,

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:54.180
I was able to build this
app that otherwise wouldn't

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.360
exist if weren't for Angular.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.080
And I feel really good
about it because I

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.630
feel like these applications
can really change the way people

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.110
interact and how they
do things, and how

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.540
technology can make life better.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.341
MALE SPEAKER: So let's see.

00:04:13.341 --> 00:04:14.840
There's been a
number of new things.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.663
So first of all, Angular
1.2 was released.

00:04:17.663 --> 00:04:18.579
MISKO HIVERY: Finally.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:19.495
MALE SPEAKER: Finally.

00:04:19.495 --> 00:04:21.147
Just in time for Devoxx.

00:04:21.147 --> 00:04:21.980
Thank you very much.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.110
IGOR MINAR: I'm not
sure if it's related.

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.830
It was pretty close, and
we were heading for Devoxx,

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.220
so we're like yeah, it's time.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.720
Cut it.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.886
MALE SPEAKER: It's Devoxx-driven
development, right?

00:04:30.886 --> 00:04:31.576
DDD.

00:04:31.576 --> 00:04:32.500
IGOR MINAR: DDD.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.830
MALE SPEAKER: There we go.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.710
So animations, who
wants to talk about?

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.460
MISKO HIVERY: Yes.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.470
Animations are also,
I think, something

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.040
that we're very proud of.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.690
It's a very unique
take on animations.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.646
And I think most
frameworks just give you

00:04:43.646 --> 00:04:44.970
a bunch of APIs to use.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.670
And we kind of
stood back and said,

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.740
how could the
animations look like

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.860
if this was just
designed from scratch?

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.720
How can we do it
all declarative?

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.440
And so on.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.040
And so we really focused on
just making CSS-based animations

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.086
just work out-of-the-box.

00:04:58.086 --> 00:04:59.460
So if you want to
add animations,

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.150
it's as simple as just adding
a whole bunch of CSS animation

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.650
code.

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.950
MALE SPEAKER: Don't used
too much of it though.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.004
I mean, animations, you
don't want to overdo it.

00:05:07.004 --> 00:05:08.920
MISKO HIVERY: No, you
don't want to overdo it.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.299
But you want to make
it easy for people.

00:05:11.299 --> 00:05:13.090
So you want to have a
subtle animation that

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.770
helps in getting the
point across rather

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.490
then just animation
for animation sake.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:17.930
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.221
It's not just for being pretty.

00:05:19.221 --> 00:05:20.600
There's a purpose.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.317
There's UX concerns with it.

00:05:23.317 --> 00:05:25.400
Do you want to talk about
improved error messages?

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.070
I think that's an important
one, a day to day improvement

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.160
that makes a difference.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.920
IGOR MINAR: So this is one of
the things that bothered me

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.100
personally because when
I see people struggle

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.390
with their applications
when they don't know what

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.750
is happening, and they get
very unhelpful error messages,

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.470
it's not a good spot to be in.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.746
Because not only the
application's not working,

00:05:45.746 --> 00:05:47.870
but now you're getting some
information that is not

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.170
helpful in getting you
from this bad place.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.910
So what we did with Angular is
we identified all of the places

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.780
where we throw error
exceptions from,

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.780
and we gave them
unique identifiers

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.700
and gave them very
descriptive error messages.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.800
And also linked them
to a documentation page

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.830
where this message is described
in a much larger scope

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.549
and it describes the situations
where the error's happened.

00:06:14.549 --> 00:06:16.340
But as we were adding
these error messages,

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.885
we were quickly
realizing that we

00:06:17.885 --> 00:06:19.470
were adding bytes to AngularJS.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.640
And that's never a good
thing for client-side code.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.850
You want to keep
the payload small.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.130
So one thing that we
came up with was hey,

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.990
let's just strip all
these error messages

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.050
from the minified
file, but make it

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:37.530
possible to reconstitute the
error messages on the server

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.240
just by clicking
on the link, if you

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.210
had the need to debug
something in production.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.335
So it gives you the
possibility of debugging things

00:06:43.335 --> 00:06:46.500
in production, have you
had the need, as well as

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.847
smaller payload.

00:06:47.847 --> 00:06:50.430
But in development, you get full
error messages and everything

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.900
is the way it should be.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.620
MALE SPEAKER: The
way you expect it.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.800
So speaking of development,
what is the typical developer

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.910
environment for somebody
that's using Angular?

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.810
What do you see out there?

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.297
Or do you recommend anything?

00:07:04.297 --> 00:07:06.380
MISKO HIVERY: I don't think
we recommend anything.

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.050
People use Sublime
from vi to Emacs,

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.572
the standard stuff, Eclipse.

00:07:10.572 --> 00:07:12.030
MALE SPEAKER: Which
is probably one

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:13.160
of the nice things
about Angular--

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:13.370
MISKO HIVERY: WebStorm.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:14.650
I personally use WebStorm.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.480
MALE SPEAKER: --prescriptive
in that sense.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.735
MISKO HIVERY: But there
is a couple of IDs

00:07:18.735 --> 00:07:20.110
that are actually
building it in.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.269
Netbeans sent something
from JBoss, was it?

00:07:24.269 --> 00:07:25.810
IGOR MINAR: I don't
know about JBoss,

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.440
but WebStorm-- WebStorm has a
decent support for AngularJS.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.180
Netbeans is working
hard on that and stuff.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:36.670
But from the whole workflow,
what I'm happy about

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:40.330
is how Angular encourages
the test-turn development.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.440
And developers actually
take this advice

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.570
and use test-turn
development technique

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.510
to build their applications.

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:49.160
Tools like Karma
really help with that.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.290
And I'm just glad to
see that in practice.

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.570
MALE SPEAKER: So let's
talk about the future.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.760
So one question I think
you guys get quite often

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.230
is well, standards
are showing up.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.990
There are things
like Web Components.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:04.590
How does that influence
the roadmap and what

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:05.937
you guys are doing with Angular?

00:08:05.937 --> 00:08:07.770
Does it clash with what
you've done already?

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:09.020
MISKO HIVERY: No.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.242
So we actually talked about it
in our future of Angular talk,

00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:13.950
and how we would like
to be on top of it,

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:16.175
and how Web Components
is specifically--

00:08:19.492 --> 00:08:21.082
MALE SPEAKER: The observed part.

00:08:21.082 --> 00:08:22.040
IGOR MINAR: Shadow DOM.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.081
MISKO HIVERY: Shadow DOM.

00:08:23.081 --> 00:08:27.340
How specifically Shadow Dom is
helping us making that happen.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.740
Object.observe is another
area, DOM mutation observers,

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.497
and so on.

00:08:32.497 --> 00:08:34.330
MALE SPEAKER: So all
the dirty-checking that

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.740
you're doing today is something
that would go away with--

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:39.780
MISKO HIVERY: Yes,
with Object.observe.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:42.479
And it's a standard
we helped to write.

00:08:42.479 --> 00:08:43.270
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:45.040
You influenced it.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.090
Is that fair to say?

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:46.756
IGOR MINAR: Yes.

00:08:46.756 --> 00:08:47.940
MISKO HIVERY: Yes.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.856
MALE SPEAKER: The other
thing you talked about

00:08:49.856 --> 00:08:52.010
was how you like
for developers to be

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.410
able to use parts of
Angular without dragging

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.526
the whole thing, so maybe just
the dependency injection for--

00:08:58.526 --> 00:08:59.300
IGOR MINAR: Right.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.390
So I personally believe
that modularization

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:03.810
will be a key component
of the web development

00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:07.250
or the whole web
ecosystem in the future.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:10.520
And this is what we would
like to take to our hearts

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:14.340
and break Angular into smaller
pieces, each focused on one

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:15.510
particular task.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.620
For example, you mentioned
dependency injection.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.580
There's no reason why
dependency injection

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.220
needs to be built into Angular.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.090
We can just extract it, create
a separate library out of it,

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.910
and then use it in Angular.

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:27.870
But you can also use
it without Angular

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.100
in [INAUDIBLE] application,
or some other application

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.360
or anywhere.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.620
MALE SPEAKER: Good.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.410
Any other things
you find important,

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:38.390
in terms of the feedback you've
gotten that you've taken,

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:41.160
and that you think
will influence

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:45.710
the future of Angular?

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:48.460
IGOR MINAR: So one of the things
that we would like to do more

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:50.870
is get more of the
community feedback

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:52.436
on things we are doing.

00:09:52.436 --> 00:09:54.310
MALE SPEAKER: What's a
good channel for that?

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:57.730
IGOR MINAR: Definitely follow
on Twitter and Google+ feeds.

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.570
We're going to be sharing
some of the proposals

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:02.790
for the future versions
of Angular and things

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.160
that we want to do.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.070
And we would like community to
help us by providing feedback

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.930
on these proposals and help
us with reviews and stuff

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:11.690
like that.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.310
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:14.650
So we're at Devoxx.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:17.070
One of the big announcements
here was Dart 1.0.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.670
I here there's an
intersection with Angular.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.819
Do you want to go over
what happened there?

00:10:21.819 --> 00:10:22.610
MISKO HIVERY: Yeah.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:24.776
So we would like you have
a choice in which language

00:10:24.776 --> 00:10:26.140
you want to use.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.455
In JavaScript, you have
CoffeeScript, et cetera.

00:10:28.455 --> 00:10:29.830
And all of these
are semantically

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.940
equivalent to JavaScript, so
you can just use AngularJS out

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.080
of the box with them.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.330
But Dart is semantically
a little different.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:39.445
And so we actually made a port
of Angular on top of Dart.

00:10:39.445 --> 00:10:41.810
And it's actually used
internally at Google.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:44.020
So there's real
apps running on it,

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:45.757
as opposed to just hypothetical.

00:10:45.757 --> 00:10:46.590
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:47.740
In production at Google.

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.330
MISKO HIVERY: Yes.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:50.935
IGOR MINAR: So at
Google, currently we

00:10:50.935 --> 00:10:55.280
run both the Dart applications
and JavaScript applications.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:58.170
Because one thing that
we see is that language

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.369
is such a sensitive
topic among developers.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:03.535
There are people who have
different backgrounds, who

00:11:03.535 --> 00:11:04.736
have different preferences.

00:11:04.736 --> 00:11:06.860
And you can't just tell
them this is the only thing

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.380
that you can use.

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.500
And it really is up to the
project, up to the team,

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.670
to pick whatever they feel
comfortable and productive in

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.220
and use that technology.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.090
And Angular now
gives them the option

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.552
to go either with
Dart or JavaScript.

00:11:20.552 --> 00:11:21.385
MALE SPEAKER: Great.

00:11:21.385 --> 00:11:23.200
So where should
people go to find out

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.080
what's available today,
1.2, and the future?

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.360
Obviously, the
website, angularjs.org?

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.940
IGOR MINAR: Yup, angularjs.org.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.321
And on Twitter, it's @angularjs
and Google+, +angularjs.

00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:36.570
MALE SPEAKER: You guys are
having a conference soon, I

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:37.070
hear.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:38.386
An Angular conference?

00:11:38.386 --> 00:11:39.060
IGOR MINAR: Yup.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.518
We have a really
awesome community,

00:11:40.518 --> 00:11:41.700
if we haven't mentioned it.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.810
And some of the members
of the community

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.320
are throwing an
AngularJS conference

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.090
which we are taking part in.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:52.880
And this will take place
in January, mid-January.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.255
And we're really
looking forward.

00:11:54.255 --> 00:11:56.004
MALE SPEAKER: Looking
forward to that one.

00:11:56.004 --> 00:11:56.739
Thank you guys.

00:11:56.739 --> 00:11:58.280
Wish you all the
best for the future.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.050
And thanks for watching.

00:11:59.050 --> 00:11:59.966
IGOR MINAR: Thank you.

00:11:59.966 --> 00:12:01.500
MISKO HIVERY: Thank you.
