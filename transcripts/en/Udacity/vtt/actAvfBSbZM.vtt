00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.570
We spend a lot of time looking at
the basic theory of prototyping.

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.740
You know enough by now to know that
these things are only useful if you

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.840
actually build them.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.680
So let's get started on that.

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.750
The fundamental idea behind prototypes
is that your making the fastest

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.460
version of a thing that can get
you the information you need

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.160
from the people you need it from.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.400
To that end, it's useful to think about
what the fastest possible prototyping

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.350
method would be,
since that's what you'll want for

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.350
your first two prototypes.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.200
We'll be showing you two options,
either of which work for your own app or

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.950
our example app.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.160
Behind this curtain is your best friend,
the tool that will allow you to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.580
prototype and
pivot faster than any other tool.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.080
Get ready.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:40.560
Yeah, look at that.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.400
Sketching your prototypes
simply on paper is the single

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.590
best way to work on prototypes when
you're starting a project from scratch,

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.890
and it allows you to
change course very easily.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.520
You can redo parts of your designs
during user testing in order to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.770
clarify things that are being
called out as confusing.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.800
These paper prototypes are going
to be super low fidelity but

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.170
they will give you enough of an idea of
your app that their feedback will tell

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.400
you if you're going in
the right direction.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.190
There's one other method of
fast prototyping that's behind

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.530
this other curtain.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.198
Prepare to be amazed.

00:01:11.198 --> 00:01:13.274
[SOUND] Yeah.

00:01:13.274 --> 00:01:14.597
That's a printer.

00:01:14.597 --> 00:01:17.109
When you've gone through the work
of making mocks for an app,

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:20.380
you can build a simple paper prototype
by printing out these mocks.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.440
If you have mocks from
the product design course,

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.430
this rap could be for you.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.620
Both methods will work for us here, and

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.940
they will both lead to
great user feedback.
