parts to this there's a digital sign

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409
parts to this there's a digital sign
 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.710
parts to this there's a digital sign
which has detailed 3d maps of the store

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720
which has detailed 3d maps of the store
 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.330
which has detailed 3d maps of the store
and then there's a robot that's

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340
and then there's a robot that's
 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.950
and then there's a robot that's
constructing these maps to go on the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960
constructing these maps to go on the
 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.690
constructing these maps to go on the
digital sign right so let's look at each

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700
digital sign right so let's look at each
 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.520
digital sign right so let's look at each
of these at a time we have a robot that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530
of these at a time we have a robot that
 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.010
of these at a time we have a robot that
goes through the store its navigating by

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020
goes through the store its navigating by
 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.780
goes through the store its navigating by
itself which means autonomously through

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790
itself which means autonomously through
 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.270
itself which means autonomously through
the store its scanning store shelves and

the store its scanning store shelves and
 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.490
the store its scanning store shelves and
aisles and constructing a detailed 3d

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500
aisles and constructing a detailed 3d
 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.830

map it's trying to find out where every
 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.050
map it's trying to find out where every
single product is down to the shelf and

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
single product is down to the shelf and
 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.910
single product is down to the shelf and
the aisle and once it has all this

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
the aisle and once it has all this
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.440
the aisle and once it has all this
information it puts it together and

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
information it puts it together and
 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.390
information it puts it together and
sends it to the store staff so that in

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400
sends it to the store staff so that in
 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.800
sends it to the store staff so that in
real time they can find out where

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
real time they can find out where
 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.260
real time they can find out where
everything is if it sees a gap or a void

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270

everything is if it sees a gap or a void
in a shelf it knows that there's

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619
in a shelf it knows that there's
 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.260
in a shelf it knows that there's
something wrong there it's trying to

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270
something wrong there it's trying to
 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.280
something wrong there it's trying to
figure out where things have been

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290
figure out where things have been
 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.390
