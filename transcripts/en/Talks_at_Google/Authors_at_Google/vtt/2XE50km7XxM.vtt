00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: Good afternoon, you Googleites
and everybody else out there in the world.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.800
Thanks for joining me for lunch. I don't know
what you're having. I'm having sugarless gum,

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.750
actually, for lunch today. But it's not unusual.
I come from a family where my wife never leaves

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:24.840
the couch for any reason and she is on a new
diet and this is how I'm going to make my

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.840
true fortune.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.180
I'm gonna write a diet book. I, by the way,
I could be the after. It works for her. She's

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.180
been on it for two years. It's the all-you-can-eat
meat and all-you-can-drink wine diet. And

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:38.929
she's up to about a herd a week and a gallon
a day.

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:40.299
[laughter]

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:46.140
And maybe a visit to the Betty Ford Clinic
eventually. But at this point, she is as slim

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.500
and sweet as the girl I first married. And
I should point out that I am the only writer

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.500
in history who only had one wife. But that's
OK. She helps me with my research. So that

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.600
whenever I'm researching a book, she gets
deeply involved with all the same materials

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.600
that I do.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.990
And she gets very passionate about it. And
then, of course, I have to write the book

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.600
for the next year and she forgets entirely
about it. She was most helpful to me when

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.539
I did my book 'The Inner Circle', which came
out in 2004. This is about Alfred C. Kinsey,

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:24.570
who invented sex and she went with June Bloomington
and Diana with me and we went to the Kinsey

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.570
Institute.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.820
And we studied all the various arcane sexual
things he's got there. And then, of course,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.770
she helped me with the research. She's continuing
to help me with the research for that one.

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:43.140
And she also helped me with the research for
the current book, which is what brings me

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.979
here. 'When The Killing's Done'. As long as
I'm talking about her, she has a mother, my

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:46.979
wife. My mother-in-law.

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.380
My mother-in-law has always been a little
bit horrified by me as if I'm some kind of

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.119
crazy beast. But you can see that I'm not.
I'm just the most sweet guy in the world.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.420
So that, for the first 20 years, for instance,
she'd be visiting us, sitting. She'd be sitting

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.069
in the kitchen, I'd come down for breakfast
and she would jump up from the chair and say,

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.760
"My God, does he sit here?" I'd say, 'No.
It's okay. It's all right. She can sit there.'

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.180
Now we've come to a little bit of a rapprochement
and it works this way. She lives in Arizona

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.230
and I will never in the rest of my life ever
go to Arizona for any reason. And she only

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.840
comes to visit when I'm away. That's great.
It's perfect. However, when I do see her she

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.110
says, "You are so lucky." And in fact, I am
lucky because whenever I wanna discover something,

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.120
I just write a book about it. This is the
way my brain works. I write fiction. I only

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.120
write fiction.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:50.730
That's all I do. And so, 18 years ago I made
my escape from LA and moved to Santa Barbara.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:59.960
I still though, teach one day a week at USC.
I'm the first writer they ever had there.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:08.370
I started the undergrad writing program. I
love it. It's a great thing. But it's a hundred

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.370
miles each way. By the way, I have a red sports
car. See, red is my color.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.370
[laughter]

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.849
And I don't enjoy it in the slightest bit.
It's only a tool, like a screwdriver for instance.

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:21.590
And the tool enables me to get between the
blind, deaf, semi-retarded, drunken woman

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.689
in the Mercedes Benz texting in the fast lane
doing 40 miles an hour with a trucker right

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:31.550
here. And there's usually a gap about this
big. And this little sports car, you can kick

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:37.099
the gas to the floor, it's just like its Star
Wars. Boom! And you see them fading in the

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:38.099
rear-view mirror.

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.099
[laughter]

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.870
So this is my life. And all these years of
going up the Coast Highway, I always go through

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.010
Malibu and up the Coast Highway looking at
the ocean instead of through the valley. I've

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:57.010
seen the Channel Islands sitting off the Coast,
wondering what goes on out there. Now I know.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.010
[pause]

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.450
As you may know, the Channel Islands is a
national park now. But these islands were

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:10.540
originally owned by individuals for many,
many years. And they use them for sheep ranching.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.360
So that the big dumb island sitting off of
Santa Barbara, 22 miles off the coast, is

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.700
Santa Cruz Island. It's four times bigger
than Manhattan.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:27.680
Nobody lives there. As recently as the late
80s, it was owned, 95 percent of it was owned

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:35.330
by a very wealthy guy who was the son of an
oil trillionaire. And his name was Gary Stanton.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:42.030
He owned this island. Now there's a main ranch
and there were some outlying ranches and this

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.880
was used for sheep. They would sell the wool
and they would sell lambs and so on. Gary

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:52.310
Stanton, on his death, ceded it to the Nature
Conservancy, 90 percent of the island. The

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.230
other ten percent is a National Park right
now. This was owned by a different family.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:02.230
But it's all now trying to be restored. And
what I've written about, 'When the Killing's

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:10.920
Done', is this restoration process. It began
in 2001 on Anacapa Island. What I'm gonna

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:17.041
tell you now is my fiction. What I have done
is dramatize actual events. So all of what

00:05:17.041 --> 00:05:19.500
I'm going to tell you actually happened.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:27.090
So in 2001, the Park Service decided to bomb
Anacapa Island with rat poison. Brodifacoum,

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.940
the same stuff that anybody, this thing or
out there has had a heart attack, that's the

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:39.390
stuff that doctors give you. It's the same
stuff in d-Con that you put in your traps.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:45.000
The rest had gotten to Anacapa in 1853 with
the wreck of the Winfield Scott.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.160
This is a paddle-wheel steamer coming out
of San Francisco with a bunch of passengers

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:54.330
who would eventually go to the East Coast,
to New York. A lot of them were 49ers who'd

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.520
been out in the back country and had their
gold and they had made their fortune and they

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.370
were on their way back home. The boat would
go to Panama. There was no Panama Canal yet,

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:10.770
and they'd trek across and take another steamer
up the East Coast.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.110
Well, they didn't make it. They didn't make
it on this particular occasion because the

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:19.020
boat, in tremendous fog, went aground on Anacapa
Island. No one died. Everyone was rescued

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:29.380
after a couple of days. Of course, they did
have to forage for food. One guy shot a seal.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.960
You can imagine what seals taste like. They
were rescued. The gold was rescued. Everything

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.960
was great.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:40.150
But the ship went down and all the rats got
ashore. And now, 150 years later in 2001,

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.610
the Park Service decided to remove the rats.
Why? Well, because the ground-nesting birds

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.710
there had evolved in the absence of predators
and the rats were decimating their numbers.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:07:02.940
Even after all this time, they were eating
their eggs and killing the nestlings. All

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.530
right. So the Park Service decided to go out
in November of 2001, and with helicopters

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:06.530
and drop rat poison all over the island.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.840
And they said there'd be no collateral damage.
The native white-footed mouse, they captured

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:19.130
a bunch of them and they were breeding them
separately. The birds are not gonna eat it

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:20.200
'cause it's bright blue. If you know d-Con
pellets, it's bright blue. However, there

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:26.070
were some protests. And in actual fact, there
was a guy called the Rat Savior and he protested

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:33.100
this. He went out with a confederate to Anacapa
when this was underway with huge backpacks

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:39.560
full of Kibble and Vitamin K, because Vitamin
K is the antidote to brodifacoum.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.330
And I created a character based on this guy,
whom I've never met. I just read about this

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:47.440
in the newspaper. And my character's named
Dave Lajoy. And he's one of the two antagonists

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:54.160
in this novel. He's 42 years old in 2001.
He wears his hair in dreadlocks. He's a pretty

00:07:54.160 --> 00:08:01.240
cool guy, at least in his own mind. And he's
made his money with four stores that he owns

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:11.840
that sell stereo and audio and audiovisual
equipment. And he is a very, very, very angry

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:16.460
guy, one of these people who’s angry about
everything. But his one defining subject is

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:17.460
animal rights.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:24.660
And he feels that no animal should be killed
for any reason. He's opposed meanwhile to

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:31.050
a character I created called Alma Boyd Takesue,
and she works for the Park Service. And she's

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:35.019
in charge of this operation to remove the
rats and later, to remove other feral animals

00:08:35.019 --> 00:08:41.930
on Santa Cruz Island, which I'll get to in
a minute. And she is just like him. I mean,

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:47.730
they both love animals. They love the environment.
They want to preserve everything. But she

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:48.730
is intransigent.

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:55.300
There can't be any killing of anything, even
a rat. But she indulges in rail impolitic.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:01.860
She feels that certain invasive species can
be removed, must be removed, in order to preserve

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:07.120
the much rarer species that will go extinct
if they're not removed. And so that forms

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:15.709
the basis of all of what goes on in this book.
In actual life and in my novel, and we'll

00:09:15.709 --> 00:09:20.459
call him not the real guy, the actual guy,
we're just gonna talk about Dave Lajoy.

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:28.870
He was arrested with his confederate for feeding
wildlife in a National Park without a permit.

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:35.029
And his buddy, by the way, cops to it and
got a 150 dollar fine or something, because

00:09:35.029 --> 00:09:41.860
they're both dressed in black with hoodies
and black baseball caps. And they were seen

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:45.720
by a Park Ranger on Anacapa. They were the
only people there that day. But in a court

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:53.430
of law, they couldn't be proven that he had,
which one he saw throwing the stuff cause

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:54.759
they were both dressed exactly alike.

00:09:54.759 --> 00:10:00.990
So, Dave Lajoy got off on this count. Then,
and by the way, I mean this all sounds so

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:05.269
theoretical. Believe me, in my telling, it
is full of filth, horror,

00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:06.420
[audience laughter]

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:13.329
various degrees of slime, misery and antagonism,
and you also learn about the island and about

00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:19.879
geography. In fact, my favorite review of
this book said that this "is the first island

00:10:19.879 --> 00:10:28.670
biogeographical thriller." Yeah, I'm so happy
about it. I'm sure there'll never be a second

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.670
one.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:30.670
[laughter]

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.720
Before I tell you the rest of the story, maybe
I will give you a very brief reading of Dave

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:42.870
Lajoy. He's very, very, very angry at all
times. And in this tiny little passage I'm

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:48.970
going to give you, takes place the day after
Dave has interrupted Alma's meeting.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:56.509
She, by the way, I've read that in America,
people's greatest fear is not of spiders bigger

00:10:56.509 --> 00:11:01.699
than your head or Islamic terrorists or brain
cancer. It is of speaking before a large group

00:11:01.699 --> 00:11:05.490
in public. And Alma has to do this. And you
see the previous chapter from her point of

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:10.540
view. She's explaining to people at the Natural
History Museum, concerned citizens, what this

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.879
is all about.

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:17.569
And Dave has come to interrupt and jeer at
her. And, in fact, when she leaves the meeting

00:11:17.569 --> 00:11:25.230
after he's been ejected, her car has, spray
painted across it, "Die Gook Bitch." Now,

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:30.801
we don't know who spray painted that, but
we have our suspicions. And so, the next day,

00:11:30.801 --> 00:11:33.810
I'll just give you a very brief account of
Dave. He's having breakfast the next day and

00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:34.839
he's looking in the newspaper to see what
account they gave of his interrupting this

00:11:34.839 --> 00:11:35.839
meeting.

00:11:35.839 --> 00:11:36.839
[pause]

00:11:36.839 --> 00:11:37.839
Can I use language here that I couldn't use
on NPR by any chance?

00:11:37.839 --> 00:11:43.680
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: We'll just put a warning
on the video. If we could put a warning on

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:45.119
the video.

00:11:45.119 --> 00:11:59.319
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: I'm pretty good at it. I mean,
I could substitute terms like 'crap' for 'shit',

00:11:59.319 --> 00:12:05.769
but it’s not as good because this is the
way Dave just does it, you know? So I'm gonna

00:12:05.769 --> 00:12:12.019
give you just a little bit of language. This
is Dave just having breakfast, very angry

00:12:12.019 --> 00:12:13.019
guy.

00:12:13.019 --> 00:12:14.019
[reads passage]

00:12:14.019 --> 00:12:20.190
"If there's one thing he hates, it’s a runny
yolk. And toast so dry it shatters like a

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:24.649
cracker before you can spread the butter.
And rain, he hates the rain, too. Three days

00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:28.529
of it now, making a mess on the streets and
keeping shoppers out of the stores; pathetic

00:12:28.529 --> 00:12:33.029
numbers, absolutely pathetic. And all four
units with the Christmas season coming on,

00:12:33.029 --> 00:12:38.540
no less. Depressing people; drooling like
bilge down the plate glass window at the Cactus

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:43.550
Cafe where he eats breakfast five days a week
and they still can't figure out what over-fucking-easy

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:50.269
means. His dried out toast is cold. The coffee
tastes like aluminum foil and its cold, too.

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:52.059
Or lukewarm at best.

00:12:52.059 --> 00:12:57.240
And the newspaper has one stingy little article
about what went down at the museum last night,

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:02.629
tucked away in the community events round-up
for Tuesday, November 20, 2001. The date in

00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:08.839
bolder type than the headline, as if to indicate
how mind-numbing and inconsequential everything

00:13:08.839 --> 00:13:14.189
had been as it had been the day before and
the day before that. Under the headline, 'Protest

00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:20.720
at Museum Lecture', there's a scant two paragraphs
that don't begin to get at the issue. And

00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.850
worse, it don't even mention him or FDA by
name, let alone set out the counterarguments

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:28.649
he'd thrown right in the face of that condescending
little bitch from the Park Service, who was

00:13:28.649 --> 00:13:33.990
fooling nobody with her grey-eyed squint and
her all-black outfit as if she were going

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.860
to a funeral or a goth club or something.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:40.059
And all her tricked up images of the cute
little animals that just have to be saved

00:13:40.059 --> 00:13:44.860
in the face of this sudden onslaught by all
these other ugly little animals, made uglier

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:50.410
by somebody's Photoshop manipulations. As
if the birds wouldn't last another week when

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:51.410
150 years ago [audience member sneezes] lived
in complete harmony and natural balance with

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:58.990
all the other birds and plants, and the rats,
too. Something Alma Boyd Takesue, Ph. D.,

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:01.230
didn't bother to mention.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:05.249
Suddenly, he's jerking his head around and
there's Marta, fat Marta with her two ton

00:14:05.249 --> 00:14:09.680
tits and big pregnant belly that isn't pregnant
at all, only just fat, bending over some other

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.879
guy's table by the door, flirting with him,
for Christ's sake. And before he could think,

00:14:13.879 --> 00:14:19.029
he shouts out her name, surprising himself
by the violence of his voice. Everybody in

00:14:19.029 --> 00:14:23.790
the place, and there must be 30 of them, half
he recognizes and half not, looks up in unison

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.899
as if they were all named Marta. And what
did he think about that? He thinks, "Fuck

00:14:27.899 --> 00:14:32.920
you," collectively. He thinks he might have
to find another goddamned diner where they

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:37.689
know the difference between, and here she
is. Her face drawn down around her mouth shrunk

00:14:37.689 --> 00:14:42.619
to the size of a keyhole beneath the flabby
cheeks, coming to him as swiftly as her two

00:14:42.619 --> 00:14:46.149
small feet can carry her, trying to act as
if she cares.

00:14:46.149 --> 00:14:50.670
"Is everything OK?" she asks before she's
halfway to him, so everybody can hear her

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:55.160
doing her job. Even Francisco, the cook, who's
giving him a hooded look from behind the grill,

00:14:55.160 --> 00:15:00.779
a cigarette in one hand and a spatula in the
other. "No," he says, still too loud. And

00:15:00.779 --> 00:15:04.920
they're still looking, all of them. Because
they're a bunch of sad-ass, pathetic voyeurs

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.730
with nothing better to do and fuck them, really,
fuck them.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:11.459
"No, everything isn't OK. It's like I come
in here every day, don't I? And you people

00:15:11.459 --> 00:15:17.600
still don't know what over easy means? Shit,
if I wanted sunny side up, if I wanted a runny

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.949
yolk that's what I would've ordered." She's
already reaching for the plate, already apologizing,

00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:26.100
"Sorry, sir. I'll have the cook--” and all
the rest of the mollifying, meaningless, little

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:33.639
phrases she dispenses a hundred times a day
because the cook's a moron and to call her

00:15:33.639 --> 00:15:36.429
incompetent would be a compliment.

00:15:36.429 --> 00:15:41.300
But he can't help saying, snarling, and why
is he snarling? "Take it away and get it right,

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.959
or don't do it at all." And, to the retreating
twin hummocks of her butt, "And the toast

00:15:44.959 --> 00:15:46.779
is like that shit they give babies. What do
you call that? Zwieback? And I don't want

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:48.980
Zwieback, I want toast!"

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:53.120
She's at the swinging door to the kitchen
now, making a show of upending the plate in

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.520
the trash while Francisco shrinks into the
Aztecan nullity of his face, and everybody

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.959
else in the place pretends to take up their
conversations where they left off. And he

00:16:01.959 --> 00:16:06.800
can't help adding, his voice lower now, the
rage all steamed out of him though the heat

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.399
still up high, "Simple toast. Is that too
much to ask?"

00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:11.399
[ends passage]

00:16:11.399 --> 00:16:16.529
So, that was your introduction to Dave from
his point of view and, of course, what novelists

00:16:16.529 --> 00:16:22.339
love to do is have opposing points of view
and you get deep into each of the antagonists

00:16:22.339 --> 00:16:23.339
and how they feel.

00:16:23.339 --> 00:16:27.079
And Dave, he's not a nice guy. He's a boor.
He's a bully. He's angry. But he does have

00:16:27.079 --> 00:16:35.420
a good point. He is against the killing of
anything. Alma, on the other [audience member

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:42.200
sneezes] side, is rational but she's also
very intransigent and a little uptight and

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:50.629
a little stiff. And maybe neither one of them
is exactly the most wonderful person in the

00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:56.600
world. But I mean aside from present company,
nobody else is either, right? One further

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:09.790
little note about Dave. You might hear some
of this tonight when he comes in. Is that

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:11.560
all right?

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.839
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Yeah.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:15.950
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: Yeah. 'Cause it's a shtick.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:16.950
[Boyle laughs]

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:18.430
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: I won't say anything
in advance.

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.870
&gt;&gt;T. C. Boyle: All right. Thanks. Well, you
can whisper into your mother's ear. Is that

00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:21.870
your mother [ ]?

00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:22.870
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: My wife.

00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:23.870
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: Your wife.

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:24.870
[audience member laughs]

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:25.870
You whisper into her ear about what's gonna
happen. And you remember when you were like,

00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:26.870
nine years old? You loved the movie and then
you saw it the second time with your best

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:27.870
friend and just before something happens,
you whisper to them.

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:28.870
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: I'll do that.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:29.870
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: You can do that. So, one more
thing about Dave --

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:30.870
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: This is the good
part.

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:31.870
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: Huh?

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:32.870
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: This is the good
part.

00:17:32.870 --> 00:17:33.870
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: Oh, we're gonna get to good
stuff. No, there's plenty. I'll shift it for

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:34.870
tonight's performance so you don't have to
be too bored. That reminds me. By the way,

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:38.010
I've already made fun of my wife a little
bit now. Now I have to tell you about the

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:44.032
true love of my wife. Sometimes she'll go
with me on tour. She's done it a million times.

00:17:44.032 --> 00:17:48.090
Like maybe in Germany, she'll go in Germany
or something. And she'll hear pretty much

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:52.830
the same show every night, night after night.
And I'll look out into the audience and see

00:17:52.830 --> 00:17:55.420
her with her head thrown back, howling with
laughter.

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:56.910
[audience laughter]

00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:03.910
That's love. That's real love. Anyway, Dave
doesn't have a whole lot of love and here's

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:12.930
one other thing he does. Before all of this
takes place, Alma had just moved to town.

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:17.510
She just got the job with the Park Service
and she lives in one of those parts of Santa

00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:21.140
Barbara which is a little village. And she
knew everybody in the village. She began to

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:26.730
get acquainted with them and she had her favorite
restaurant, a very nice, upscale Italian place.

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:31.200
She'd often go there alone or with girlfriends
and she felt comfortable there. She knew the

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:38.560
owner and the maître-de. And so, before any
of this happened, she happened to be in a

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.020
cafe listening to a folk singer and met Dave.
He's a good looking guy. They're both in their

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:47.270
thirties at that point. And he and she struck
up a conversation. They're both environmentalists.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.140
They love nature. And so, he asked her on
a date. Well, she doesn't know who he is,

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:57.050
though she said, "Yeah, sure, but I'd feel
comfortable if we could go to the restaurant,

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:01.090
my restaurant in my village." No problem.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:09.630
So they go on the date and they come and,
Dave, well you just heard him. He's little

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:12.870
bit out there, a little bit out there. He
orders the most expensive bottle of wine on

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:20.860
the list. It's 320 dollars. And he's already
getting out of, getting crazy because there's

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:25.640
no sommelier, just a waiter. "Where's the
sommelier?" "We don't have a sommelier." "Jesus."

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.450
So, he then, he asks the owner to come over
and the owner comes over personally and offers

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:30.580
a bottle of wine to Dave.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:36.060
And Dave goes through the ritual. He sniffs
the cork, the swirling of the glass, a little

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:41.360
taste and so on. Spits it right out and says,
"It's rotgut. Get it out of here." All right.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:47.880
So then, he orders the second most expensive
bottle of wine on the list and the same scenario

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:52.630
takes place. At which point, Alma gets up
and leaves. So that was their first meeting.

00:19:52.630 --> 00:20:02.410
That was their first date. And speaking of
love, by the way,[pause] the truest test of

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:07.290
love if you are a writer like me, of your
friends, of your wives, or your circle of

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:11.990
friends, is this. That story that I just told
you actually happened while I was writing

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:17.030
this novel to a friend of mine who lives here
in the Bay Area. She's a lawyer. She just

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:23.720
moved into one of the little towns on the
Bay and she met a guy on the internet who

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.470
claimed also to be a lawyer.

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:31.260
Well, and a tall lawyer for that matter. But
actually, he was a short, young lawyer, but

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.740
what the hell. They went on a date and took
her to a restaurant and the whole scene played

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:35.881
out just as I told you. They're happily married
now, three children--No. No. No. It was a

00:20:35.881 --> 00:20:37.290
one-time deal.

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:46.070
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: But I just want
to let you know. The wine was bad.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:47.070
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: Was it?

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.070
[audience laughter]

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.070
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Yeah.

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.070
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: Yeah, but you know. Don't
forget, don't forget the owner, of course,

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:57.400
is gonna taste this wine in the back to know.
Wow. So anyway, my friends all know that when

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.810
they will reveal anything to me and they know
that their deepest sexual secrets will be

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:00.810
revealed to the public for my profit eventually.

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:10.361
And that is the test of love and friendship
beyond any I could imagine. All right. So,

00:21:10.361 --> 00:21:15.940
let me just tell you a little bit more about
the continuing story. The first third of the

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.410
book is the Anacapa story, which I just told
you about. And that sets up the big fight

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:21.590
to come.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:27.090
And again, this is what attracted me to this
story. It seems utterly absurd when you have

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:33.450
a closed ecosystem and you add or remove something
that's invasive, you don't know what the effects

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:40.990
will be. And biologists call it a "cascading
effect", where one thing leads to something

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:47.370
you couldn't even imagine. So, briefly, just
after World War II, Monsanto Chemical Company

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.120
dumped DDT into the Santa Monica Bay.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:55.340
The result was, this worked its way up the
food chain. You've all read your Rachel Carson,

00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:02.500
'Silent Spring'. And the bald eagles, which
inhabited all the islands, were exterminated.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:08.340
Their eggs would no longer hatch. They died
off. They are more territorial and tougher

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.670
than the Golden Eagle. They are verciferious;
they mainly eat fish. The Golden Eagle eats

00:22:12.670 --> 00:22:19.220
groundhogs. And so, in the absence of the
moles, the Goldens moved in. Why? Because

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:22.200
there was a good food source for them.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:29.370
Delicious, fat, creamy, ripe, little piglets.
The pigs, how had the pigs gotten there? Well,

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:34.080
the original sheep ranchers had some pigs
and the pigs got loose. Now 150 years later,

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:41.650
they were feral. Wild boars all over the island.
Wouldn't be so bad except that, except for

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:47.210
the sheep. The sheep had to be removed because
once it became a National Conservancy and

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:50.630
a National Park Service, the sheep were changing
the ecology. As you know, sheep eat everything,

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:57.040
right down to the root. So, there were no
longer any young trees, or saplings.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.880
All we had was elderly trees, which would
die. Trees are very important on the ridgeline

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:05.480
because they trap the moisture from the fog,
which gives the island, which is rather dry,

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:09.930
some of its moisture. So it's changing the
ecology. All right. So the first thing is

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:15.580
they removed all the sheep. Not a big deal
because the sheep gone back and forth anyway.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:20.600
They could be trapped and sent back to the
mainland. I'm sure a lot of them became lamb

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:27.310
chops, but this is the way life is. However,
this could not happen with the pigs. They

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:32.990
were a discrete population. They'd been there
for 150 years. And the fear was they might

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:39.781
have developed peculiar diseases that would,
could be communicated back ashore to other

00:23:39.781 --> 00:23:46.690
pigs and it would decimate our pork industry
throughout America. So they had to be killed

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:51.320
in situ. So, what happened was, in real life
and in my telling, the Nature Conservancy

00:23:51.320 --> 00:24:00.400
and the Park Service got together and they
hired a group of New Zealish guys who specialize

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.650
in exterminating animals on islands.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:07.700
The New Zealish and the Aussies obviously
know a lot about this for obvious reasons.

00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:13.810
And at a mere cost of seven million dollars,
they came in, fenced off the island progressively,

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:19.520
killed all the pigs. They shot them dead and
just left them there to rot -- 5500 of them

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:27.110
as it turns out. Why did this have to be done?
Well, because of the invasive fennel.

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:31.440
And I mean, it sounds like something Samuel
Beckett would have come up with for a play.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.900
'The Invasive Fennel'. Once the sheep are
removed, the fennel, the seeds you use in

00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:42.400
sausages and so on. This grew up into an enormous
thicket. It's the size of this room, 20 feet

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.400
high.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:49.020
And delicious piglets hid in the thickets
and the Goldens and nothing to eat. What are

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:55.679
they gonna eat? Now we get to the poster animal
out of all of this. The dwarf island fox,

00:24:55.679 --> 00:25:02.230
which is four- to six- pounds, the size of
a small cat, through the principles of modern

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:09.810
biogeography which will either make an animal
larger or smaller depending on its availability

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:14.460
of food resources and its niche. This animal
has been there 16,000 years and it has become

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.980
a [ ] variety. It's very rare.

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:26.680
And suddenly, they were disappearing and no
one knew exactly why. Well, one of the biologists,

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:32.820
Lois Ramire, who runs the Nature Conservancy
project there, showed me on her computer screen,

00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:38.110
a Golden Eagle chick that they photographed.
We love it. I mean, it's just, it's this big.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:40.430
It's got claws. It's a Golden Eagle. We love
Golden Eagles.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:45.860
But beneath it were the remains of 20 of these
foxes, one of which had a radio collar on

00:25:45.860 --> 00:25:50.730
it, which is how they discovered the problem.
All right. So they had to take all the remaining

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:54.870
foxes. They had to breed them 'cause they'd
be gone. This all happened within the last

00:25:54.870 --> 00:26:02.830
five or six years. They'd be gone. They'd
be extinct now. And so, in came the biologists

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:05.480
to trap the Goldens, which is not easy.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:10.970
This is a big animal, flying. If they threw
nets out of helicopters, but then it falls.

00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:15.750
They've actually trapped them without harming
them and take them to the Sierras and let

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:24.050
them go. Meanwhile, they brought in bald eagles
from Alaska to repopulate the islands. And

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:30.160
it's working because I was there with my wife
for the release of the first two bald eagle

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:36.260
chicks born on that island since the 40s.
And again, the chick is like this. And right

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:38.020
now, they have let the foxes go and it seems
that they have been able to restore this ecosystem.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:49.880
But of course, the question as this book poses,
and actually I should show you the epigraph,

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:55.730
is who has the right to do all of this? How
do we get to be the ones to decide? Yes, we're

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:59.620
the biggest animal. We're the toughest. We're
the smartest. We eat them. We use them for

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:05.910
our pleasure. But look at the rat. What about
the white rat that the kids have?

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:13.960
Living in a cage in a privileged position
while behind the walls are their feral cousins

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:20.870
crapping, screwing, and dying every night.
And one is -- we love it, and the other is

00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:31.700
a nuisance. So the book has an epigraph from
Genesis 1:28 and it sort ofsets up the thematic

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.507
elements of the book for me. "And God blessed
them and God said unto them: Be fruitful and

00:27:34.507 --> 00:27:38.130
multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue
it and have dominion over the fish of the

00:27:38.130 --> 00:27:42.530
sea and over the fowl of the air and over
every living thing that moveth upon the Earth."

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:49.040
So I start from that proposition and try to
examine this. Can I make a story out of it.

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.430
This is simply the way, for better or worse,
my brain works.

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:58.950
I can't really do deep thinking unless I'm
actually writing something. People see me

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:03.610
on the street and they think, "Oh, there he
goes. He's probably thinking deep thoughts

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:07.913
and coming up with his next novel." No, I'm
just like all the rest of you. When I'm walking

00:28:07.913 --> 00:28:11.560
down the street, I'm thinking, "Kill. Screw.
Eat. Kill. Screw. Eat."

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.560
[audience laughter]

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:18.360
Exclusively, you know? I can only think about
issues like this. When I'm in the middle of

00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:20.700
some complex story and I never have an outline,
I don't know what it's going to be. It just

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:27.080
evolves organically as I go on day by day
over the course of a year. And I think all

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:33.110
these artistic questions and structural questions
and thematic questions resolve themselves

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:42.050
on an unconscious level. So all of that said,
and we have some time left. I mean, I could

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:46.150
read the entire novel to you except the last
paragraph.

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:47.150
[laughter]

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:51.810
Or we could do questions. Then I can save
this wonderful story for people who might

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:53.080
be going to the gig tonight to have something
that's fresh and beautiful.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.080
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Sure. Really?

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.080
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: Yeah, really.

00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.080
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Yeah.

00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:02.900
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: Yeah. How much time do we
have? Do we have 20 minutes more? Do you wanna

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:06.180
ask questions? I mean, how are we gonna so
this? It's up to you.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.960
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: 20 minutes. The story
that you were gonna tell. Certainly that will

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.040
leave time for questions.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.390
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: Well, maybe not.

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:13.480
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Maybe not.

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.080
&gt;&gt;T. C. Boyle: The story is 400 pages long.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.080
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Oh.

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.080
[laughter]

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.080
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: I mean, do we have to exactly
have an hour, or can we run over?

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.080
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Well, there's another
meeting coming in at 1:00.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.980
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: Oh, another meeting. By the
way, remember I told you how lucky I am? Yes,

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:34.980
I'm a professor, but I don't go to meetings.
I can't bear meetings, I can't, I'm sorry;

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:39.390
I don't care what anybody else says. I don't
want to hear them, I don't want their opinions.

00:29:39.390 --> 00:29:55.920
I'm not a team player, I never will be, I'm
sorry. So, I feel lucky. I don't have to go

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:59.560
to meetings.

00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:16.900
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: That's a lot like
the meetings I go to.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:24.990
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: 
Is it?

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:32.051
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: Yeah.

00:30:32.051 --> 00:30:47.900
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: Really? Everybody feels the
same way. I think instead of reading you another

00:30:47.900 --> 00:31:02.650
story, I just want to talk to you and take
your questions. How's that? But I know there

00:31:02.650 --> 00:31:28.120
are a lot of engineers in the room. Please
no math questions. Throw it out. Come on.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:43.200
Give me something. Anything you wanna know
about in regard to this or the dwarf foxes.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:52.400
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: So, you're speaking
to your method for writing novels. How is

00:31:52.400 --> 00:32:00.430
that different in terms of thought processes
for short stories you write? Is it just an

00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:16.500
inkling of an idea and you just develop that.
When you write, when you come up with an idea,

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:25.169
how do you decide, "Oh, this is a short story,"
versus, "I'm gonna go more further into?"

00:32:25.169 --> 00:32:29.450
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: I can see that we're not,--

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:32.490
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Can you repeat the question?

00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:40.900
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: Yeah, I can see we're not
all engineers in the room.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:41.900
[laughter]

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:51.640
Writers. Yeah, I'll wait for these poor guys,
way over here. Where are these guys anyway?

00:32:51.640 --> 00:33:01.070
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: I think they're
in Santa Monica.

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:04.850
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Santa Monica.

00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:16.560
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: Santa Monica, OK. Wow. So,
you know all about the DDT in the Bay. You're

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:19.050
probably drinking it in that coffee.

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:20.050
[laughter]

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:35.800
The question was is there, do I have a difference
between the novels and short stories when

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.220
I'm developing ideas?

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.600
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #2: Yes.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:47.770
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: Yes. They're very discrete.
I never had a short story get larger and become

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:55.020
a novel, or vice versa, a novel become progressed
to a story. I'm very single-minded and I work

00:33:55.020 --> 00:34:04.660
in periods. And I will write a novel. Then
I'll write maybe half a book of stories because

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:15.569
your ideas peter out. Then I'll write another
novel and then the other half of the book

00:34:15.569 --> 00:34:16.569
of stories.

00:34:16.569 --> 00:34:23.169
And on and on and on. And incidentally, the
joy of writing a novel, which is what I was

00:34:23.169 --> 00:34:37.520
doing before they dragged me off on this tour
three weeks ago, is that you know what you're

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:45.849
going to do tomorrow. The problem is, anything
that you might tell me or I might learn or

00:34:45.849 --> 00:34:54.790
read about, or anything that happens in society,
I can't really use.

00:34:54.790 --> 00:35:07.760
I have to put it aside because I'm locked
into some other novel altogether. And sometimes

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:12.810
it might be an historical novel even. The
joy of the short story is anything that you

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:22.910
want to address, you can address over a period
of six to eight months or however long I might

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:28.039
be writing stories. The downside is in-between
stories, you are bereft.

00:35:28.039 --> 00:35:34.559
You have nothing to do. You're completely
nuts. You realize that you're doomed. You're

00:35:34.559 --> 00:35:40.609
a failure. You've never written anything before.
You'll never write anything again. You're

00:35:40.609 --> 00:35:46.930
over the hill. And you only think about a
suicide for the first week.

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:51.119
Then, maybe, a glimmer of a story comes and
you start with a sentence. I always see something

00:35:51.119 --> 00:35:58.420
and then I start with a sentence and then
I try to follow that. I might, the first couple

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:05.609
of days I might just get one paragraph done.
Once you get into the flow and your unconscious

00:36:05.609 --> 00:36:10.650
mind takes over, then the story reveals itself.
You find the ending. It might take another

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:16.140
two weeks. Then you have the dead week at
the end where you're trying to figure out

00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:24.170
what you're going to do with your life. And
this is of course why all writers are drug

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:30.410
addicts and alcoholics, and why they beat
their wives, their children and their dogs.

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:32.809
Except for me. I'm exceptional.

00:36:32.809 --> 00:36:33.869
[pause]

00:36:33.869 --> 00:36:34.930
Yes.

00:36:34.930 --> 00:36:46.809
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: You were talking
about an idea intrigues you and then you sort

00:36:46.809 --> 00:36:58.029
of process it by writing a novel about it.
So, for instance, this story about this island.

00:36:58.029 --> 00:37:04.720
There's a lot of parts, I guess there's conflict
sort of inherent in it. But it’s not necessarily

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:13.380
a story like with a complete arc. How do you
construct the story arc out of all these different

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:14.380
parts?

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:16.369
&gt;&gt;T. C. Boyle: Um hmm.

00:37:16.369 --> 00:37:19.859
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #3: Another writer
here.

00:37:19.859 --> 00:37:27.690
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: Great. The question for you
guys in Santa Monica. Is it about, there's

00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:36.359
a lot of disparate elements in here. How do
I construct just a narrative out of the whole

00:37:36.359 --> 00:37:44.359
thing? I don't know. I don't know. It's everybody
has some kind of gift and this is my gift.

00:37:44.359 --> 00:37:51.490
I don't know how I do it. There's a deep structure
that has to reveal itself.

00:37:51.490 --> 00:38:07.690
An example of another way of working. I was
going off on tour a couple years ago. And

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:17.400
forgive me. My entire life is book tours.
It's all I know about.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:29.859
And I just met with a grad class the week
before. I just met two of the students. And

00:38:29.859 --> 00:38:42.059
they came in just to chat with me to get acquainted.
And each said, "Yeah, I'm writing a novel

00:38:42.059 --> 00:38:52.360
but I'm having trouble." And I said, "Well,
okay. Great. We'll work on that. How far along

00:38:52.360 --> 00:39:01.640
are you?" They said, "Like, 300 pages." I
say, "Great, wonderful."

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:15.410
But they're not connected pages. They've written
the kitchen scene because they love the kitchen

00:39:15.410 --> 00:39:31.309
scene, but it's sitting there to be stuck
in somewhere. I don't think it’s supposed

00:39:31.309 --> 00:39:54.640
to work that way. I think it has to be organic,
as I've said. It has to evolve as you go along

00:39:54.640 --> 00:40:04.349
and discover what it is. So, this is the way
I work. It's the only way I know how to work.

00:40:04.349 --> 00:40:05.349
[pause]

00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:06.349
Yeah.

00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:12.089
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: Speaking of structure,
one of my favorite novels of yours is 'The

00:40:12.089 --> 00:40:19.700
Women'. In that, I found the structure fascinating
because you end with Mamah's story and that's

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:27.270
actually really quite early on in Frank Lloyd
Wright's life. How did you, I mean, I have

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:35.200
my own theories on why you ended with Mamah's
story, because he just goes on to do so many

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:42.259
great things after that, and really, he had
no right to do that.

00:40:42.259 --> 00:40:43.259
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: Yes.

00:40:43.259 --> 00:40:52.810
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: So I'm kind of
interested. Can you address how you initially

00:40:52.810 --> 00:41:01.310
wrote that story of Frank Lloyd Wright? Did
you have that structure in mind?

00:41:01.310 --> 00:41:09.670
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: Sure. What a great question.
For everybody else who's not hearing this

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:18.789
question, there's a lot of praise involved.
I mean, we've just had several paragraphs

00:41:18.789 --> 00:41:23.349
of praise of how wonderful I am.

00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:24.349
[laughter]

00:41:24.349 --> 00:41:32.910
But I won't get into that. It's a question
about the structure of 'The Women', my last

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:39.819
novel before this, which deals with the entire
life and career of Frank Lloyd Wright, primarily

00:41:39.819 --> 00:41:46.450
though, as seen through the point of view
of his four women in his life: his mistress

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:51.269
and his three wives. And it also runs backwards
so that you begin with his last wife and go

00:41:51.269 --> 00:41:53.190
down the ladder to the death of Mamah.

00:41:53.190 --> 00:42:00.480
Well, for obvious reasons, I could then end
climactically with the murder of Martha Borthwick

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:04.180
Cheney. She was killed with a hatchet by a
crazed servant. Her two children were killed,

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.270
also. And also several other workers and the
house was burned down. What's so interesting,

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:11.579
as you say, is that Frank Lloyd Wright was
not there that day because he was doing the

00:42:11.579 --> 00:42:16.349
Midway Gardens in Chicago and commuting back
and forth. And he was trying to get this thing

00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:17.749
onto deadline and get it built.

00:42:17.749 --> 00:42:21.980
Had he been there, he well could have been
killed and there would have been nothing beyond

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:29.630
1914. So there's all of that. Well, as soon
as I discovered this structure, and of course,

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:30.650
I had a structural idea in the beginning,
which I didn't have with this cause each one

00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:31.650
is different.

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:32.650
[pause]

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:33.650
I could meditate on what love relationships
are. How, not me, of course, but I'm sure

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:45.029
all of you maybe had more than one relationship
in your life, where you're in love and it's

00:42:45.029 --> 00:42:46.029
this great thing.

00:42:46.029 --> 00:42:50.509
You wanna spend every second with your inamorata
and it's so great. But maybe after a while,

00:42:50.509 --> 00:42:55.499
you fall apart and maybe it goes sour. Maybe
it even gets antagonistic. So I was able to

00:42:55.499 --> 00:42:57.200
show, by going backwards, each of them. Like,
to begin with, Olgivanna, his last wife was

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:04.430
there and he's in love with her, but he's
being pursued by his previous wife, Miriam.

00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:05.869
Miriam is this virago. She's a lunatic. She's
horrible. But then, as we go backwards, we

00:43:05.869 --> 00:43:07.569
see Miriam in a new light, when he first meets
her and she's so sexy and enchanting and that

00:43:07.569 --> 00:43:09.239
enables me to play with the idea of what relationships
are.

00:43:09.239 --> 00:43:15.410
Then again, I'm using real material. I love
the real history, or the real biology. I'm

00:43:15.410 --> 00:43:19.500
just dramatizing it. So Miriam, in real life,
and in my telling, came to Frank Lloyd Wright

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.190
and after the death of Mamah. She'd been murdered.
Taliesin Center had been burned down. He got

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:22.580
lots of sympathy. He got letters from all
over the world, thousands of them.

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.270
'Cause he was pretty well-known at this point.
One came from Miriam Maude Noel. She was around

00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:28.502
his age, which was late 40s at that time.
She was an elegant and beautiful woman.

00:43:28.502 --> 00:43:29.502
[pause]

00:43:29.502 --> 00:43:30.502
Widowed. She'd been living in Paris for the
last ten years. But World War I drove her

00:43:30.502 --> 00:43:31.502
back to live in this miserable room in Chicago
with her daughter.

00:43:31.502 --> 00:43:32.502
And he liked her letter so much, he agreed
to meet with her on Christmas Eve, in his

00:43:32.502 --> 00:43:37.609
office in Chicago, their first meeting. And
she swept in wearing her sealskin coat and

00:43:37.609 --> 00:43:47.859
this beautiful hat and these boas and everything
else and had a lorgnette and a cigarette in

00:43:47.859 --> 00:43:54.299
a holder. And she just talked breathlessly
to him about love and passion and poetry and

00:43:54.299 --> 00:43:57.560
everything else, on and on and on. He was
mesmerized by her.

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.390
Then she paused for breath and said, "So,
how do you like me?" And he said, "I've never

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:02.390
seen anything like you." Boom! Wow, that was
it. What a relationship. Also, I got this

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:07.220
information from his own autobiography. But
what do you do with it? And I just structured

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:11.960
it. So, each one is different and each one
has its own [audience member sneezes] [ ]. And

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.579
you're right to ask this question because
in that case, I had a structural idea to begin

00:44:13.579 --> 00:44:14.579
with.

00:44:14.579 --> 00:44:15.579
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #4: So, which of the
books have [audience member coughs] less of

00:44:15.579 --> 00:44:16.579
that historical aspect? I can think of maybe
'Drop City' having less of that Or do all

00:44:16.579 --> 00:44:17.579
of them have some kind of factual base that
you're drawing from?

00:44:17.579 --> 00:44:26.650
&gt;&gt; T. C. Boyle: The question is which of the
books [audience member coughs] have less of

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:31.280
the history or less of factual? I rotate always
between different sorts of things, just to

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.660
keep myself fresh and to keep the audience
fresh. So that novels that are just whole

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:33.660
cloth are things like 'East Is East' set in
Georgia. Or there's 'The Writer's Colony'

00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:34.660
set in Japan.

00:44:34.660 --> 00:44:35.660
Most recently,[pause] 'A Friend of the Earth'.
'A Friend of the Earth', which precedes this,

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:36.660
is also about environmental issues; the year
2000 on global warming, which projects into

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:37.900
2025. And that is just us. And so two of the
stories.

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:38.900
Some stories require some research, 'cause
I set stories anywhere. I have no limitations.

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:39.900
I can set a story anywhere on earth. And some
are just experiences. It requires nothing.

00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:40.900
Just you are inspired. You do it. I'll give
you an example. I wrote a story a few years

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.599
back that the New Yorker published and it
was called 'Swept Away'. It's a very whimsical

00:44:43.599 --> 00:44:44.599
story.

00:44:44.599 --> 00:44:49.660
I had read that the windiest place in the
world is the Shetland Islands of Scotland.

00:44:49.660 --> 00:44:51.349
Kids, little kids get spun down the street,
cats, flower pots. It's always windy there.

00:44:51.349 --> 00:44:52.349
So what fun! What would that be like? So I
wrote a love story. It's about an American

00:44:52.349 --> 00:44:53.349
ornithologist who comes to study the birds.
She's kind of pretty. She's wearing a little

00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:54.349
tartan skirt that she's bought at the tourist
shop. She's got black leggings and she's kind

00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:55.349
of cute. She's just got off the ferry, got
her backpack full of cameras and stuff. And

00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:56.349
she's walking up the main street. And behind
the window of the main street are all the

00:44:56.349 --> 00:45:01.530
local slugs who live there drinking beer.
And it turns out that one of them is Robbie

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:06.660
Bakey and he's never had a girlfriend in his
life. He's never done anything with his life.

00:45:06.660 --> 00:45:08.290
He's lived on his family's sheep ranch and
so on.

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:09.839
And his cat is out there trying to catch pigeons.
It's a big cat, not like the cats we were

00:45:09.839 --> 00:45:10.839
talking about, the foxes we were talking about.
This is a 14-pound cat. It's blown off by

00:45:10.839 --> 00:45:11.839
a gust and it cracks Julie [ ] right in the
head and she's knocked out unconscious on

00:45:11.839 --> 00:45:12.839
the road. And at that point, old Duncan Stauer,
the oldest guy on the island, is coming in

00:45:12.839 --> 00:45:16.030
his car, his ancient car, going ten miles
an hour right for her and Robbie Bakey runs

00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:17.059
out and saves her.

00:45:17.059 --> 00:45:18.190
And so, the romance starts. All right. Well,
this has a lot of local color, this story.

00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:19.619
Shetland Islands. So, two years later the
local magazine on the Shetland Islands, 'The

00:45:19.619 --> 00:45:21.430
Shetlander', asked me if they could reprint
the story because it was so great and they

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:23.810
wondered how many years I lived in the Shetland
Islands. And I had to point out that I had

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:25.940
never actually been to the Shetland Islands.
But I had been to the Arctic Coast of Scotland

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:27.450
once in Oban and I nearly froze to death.
That was enough.

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:28.450
And the rest is invented. So I got lots of
details of the Islands, right down to names

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:29.450
of characters and so on. And faked it. That's
what it's about. It's an improvisation. It's

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:30.450
a seduction of view. I am inviting you into
this world for you to believe in.

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:31.450
But sometimes, as with the details of this
or with the Frank Lloyd Wright book, the historical

00:45:31.450 --> 00:45:32.519
details, I love the history so much. Or here
the ecology, that I'm sort of instructing

00:45:32.519 --> 00:45:33.519
you in it. There've been over 1006 books written
about Frank Lloyd Wright. I never realized

00:45:33.519 --> 00:45:36.420
the extent of the cult of him until I went
to write this book, wrote this book. But if

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:37.490
you've never read any of them and know nothing
about him, you can read this novel and it's

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:38.490
all true; all the facts are true.

00:45:38.490 --> 00:45:39.490
But, of course, I'm playing it for my own
purposes and dramatizing it. You know, history

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:40.490
is wonderful, but it doesn't tell you what
people were thinking. You just heard a day

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:41.490
of Lajoy for instance. You're in his head.
You get an idea of what he's thinking. You

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:42.490
don't get that necessarily from history. So
my fun by going to some of these books is

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:43.490
to dramatize them. What was it like? [pause]
The first book I wrote in Santa Barbara. It's

00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:44.490
called 'Riven Rock'.

00:45:44.490 --> 00:45:45.490
I figured I would need to know some of the
history of the place I just moved to. 'Riven

00:45:45.490 --> 00:45:46.490
Rock is set at the turn of the last century,
and it deals with Stanley McCormick. He was

00:45:46.490 --> 00:45:47.490
the heir to the McCormick reaper, the fortune.
A millionaire. He had a big 35-acre estate

00:45:47.490 --> 00:45:48.490
and so on. When he was in his late 20s, he
married a woman, also in her late 20s, Catherine

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:49.490
Dexter McCormick, an amazing beauty and also
very, very wealthy. First female graduate

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:50.490
in the sciences at MIT. And I would say he's
very handsome; tall, handsome guy, wealthy,

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:51.490
bright-thinking.

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:52.490
The problem is he had a mental problem, which
was beginning to become paranoia. He was a

00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:53.490
schizophrenic. Catherine made the great mistake
that many women do, thinking, "Well, you know,

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:54.490
he's a little squirrely, but if I get him
away from his mother, I think I can straighten

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:55.490
him out." Catastrophically wrong. It was just
the most horrendous marriage in history. To

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:56.490
just give one detail. They never consummated
the marriage.

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:57.490
Stanley was incapable. He became, what was
called a 'sexual maniac'. For 20 years, he

00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:58.490
had to be locked in Riven Rock, away from
everybody because any woman he saw, he would

00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:59.490
assault immediately. Not necessarily sexually,
but just assault. He was that crazy. And I

00:45:59.490 --> 00:46:00.490
think it was because having to be intimate
was too much for him to stand and it made

00:46:00.490 --> 00:46:01.490
his mental problems more full-blown.

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:02.490
And if you really want to hear horror, and
this is true. On the day they were married,

00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:03.490
at her chateau in Geneva, which is now the
American Embassy. And he was early advocate

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:04.490
of motor cars, 1905. Their honeymoon was a
month motoring through France. Two other individuals

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:05.490
came with them. His mother and her mother.
How could you make this stuff up? It is so

00:46:05.490 --> 00:46:06.490
fabulous. And so, to conclude all of this,
I will say, people ask me about this book.

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:07.490
They said, "How do you know that the marriage
was unconsummated?" It's easy. I wrote the

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:08.490
book.

00:46:08.490 --> 00:46:09.490
[laughter]

00:46:09.490 --> 00:46:10.490
So, thank you very much.

00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:11.490
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Thank you. Thank you.

00:46:11.490 --> 00:46:11.491
[applause]
