00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.100
- [Instructor] An object
is moving along a line.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.790
The following graph gives
the object's position,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.840
relative to its starting point, over time.

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.260
For each point on the graph,
is the object moving forward,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.770
backward, or neither?

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.840
So pause this video and
try to figure that out.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.070
All right, so we see we
have position in meters

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.750
versus time, so for example,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.150
this point right over here
tells us that after one second,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.560
we are four meters ahead
of our starting point.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.400
Or for example, this point right over here

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.630
says that after four seconds,
we are almost it seems,

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.030
almost four meters behind
our starting point.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.880
So let's look at each of
these points and think about

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.820
whether we're moving forward,
backward, or neither.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.550
So at this point right over here,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.750
at that moment, we're
about 2 1/2 meters in front

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.820
of our starting point.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.920
We're at a positive
position of 2 1/2 meters.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.160
But as time goes on,
we are moving backwards

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.690
closer and closer to the starting point.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.430
So this is we are moving backward.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.520
One way to think about it,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.640
at this time we're at 2 1/2 meters.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.700
If you go forward about half a second,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.630
we are then back at our starting point.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.520
So we had to go backwards.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.660
And if we look at this
point right over here,

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.870
it looks like we were going
backwards this entire time

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.950
while our curve is downward sloping.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.480
But at this point right over here,

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.690
when we are about it
looks like five meters

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.630
behind our starting point,
we start going forward again.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.080
But right at that moment,
we are going neither

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.440
forward nor backwards.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.480
It's right at that moment
where we just finished

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.350
going backwards and we're
about to go forward,

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.810
and one way to think about it is,

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.870
what would be the slope of the
tangent line at that point,

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.086
and the slope of the
tangent line at that point

00:01:55.086 --> 00:01:58.600
would be horizontal.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.193
And so this is neither.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.330
So we can use that same technique
to think about this point.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.120
The slope is positive.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.880
And we see that all right,
right at that moment,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.860
it looks like we are
at the starting point,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.170
but if you fast forward even a few,

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.910
even a fraction of a
second, we are now in front

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.340
of our starting point.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.380
So we are moving forward.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.920
We are moving forward right over here.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.630
And at this point, we are
at our starting point,

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.960
but if you think about
what's going to happen

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.793
a moment later.

00:02:29.793 --> 00:02:31.710
A moment later we're gonna
be a little bit behind

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.992
our starting point, and so
here we are moving backward.

00:02:35.992 --> 00:02:37.523
And we're done.
