00:00:02.045 --> 00:00:03.920
FEMALE SPEAKER: --examine
the ancient climate

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.510
and migration
patterns in Africa.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:11.040
Currently, Professor Ampim
is a tenured professor

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.810
of history at
Contra Costa college

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.960
in San Pablo, California
in the east bay.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.500
And he also teaches in African
American Studies department

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.060
at Merritt college in Oakland.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.930
He also created a seven step
primary research methodology

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.750
home study course at
advancing the research.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.360
His latest work is the formation
of the Save Nubia Project,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.080
Which aims to help preserve
the archaeological sites

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.890
of ancient Kush and Nubia in
the Sudan, which are threatened

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.130
by the construction of dams.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.790
Anything else that I
was remiss in saying,

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.960
Professor Ampim, I'm
sure, will let you know.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.154
Without further ado, please
welcome Professor Ampim.

00:01:07.437 --> 00:01:08.603
MANU AMPIM: How's everybody?

00:01:08.603 --> 00:01:09.530
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.720
MANU AMPIM: OK.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.553
Good to see you all.

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:13.140
Everybody was nice and quiet
and patient and whispering

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.869
and-- or on their
laptops I like--

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.160
that's what I tell my students.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.030
When you come in,
you should be focused

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.860
on something
constructive rather than

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.500
talking about the
news of the day.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.560
Anyway, good to see all.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.170
I have the pleasure of
really sharing with you

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.510
the fruits of my primary
research over the last quarter

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.010
century.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.240
I want to thank
Umani for her effort

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.380
to help bring everyone
together and Duane really

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.940
informing people about
African civilization

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.380
because most times people only
focused on this topic when?

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.050
Generally, when?

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.887
What time of year?

00:01:44.887 --> 00:01:45.720
AUDIENCE: Ferbruary.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.719
MANU AMPIM: In February.

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.620
What I say, as a historian,
is that we really

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.200
should focus on
it 366 days a year

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.540
because it is that
much information that

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.680
has to be shared.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.701
So I'm going to just
focus on math and science

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.200
as some of the
African contributions

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.490
because they don't get
discussed very often.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.295
And I teach at
Contra Costa college.

00:02:04.295 --> 00:02:07.485
And we have people in
the scientific areas,

00:02:07.485 --> 00:02:10.410
and they more often
than not-- not

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.682
always-- more often than
not, they overlook Africa.

00:02:12.682 --> 00:02:15.220
They look at the
history of engineering,

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.446
on math or science.

00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:18.915
And I just find it
strange because I've

00:02:18.915 --> 00:02:20.820
gone to so many countries
around the world

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.462
to do firsthand research.

00:02:22.462 --> 00:02:25.450
I've gone to institutions,
libraries, and museums

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.800
throughout the US,
Canada, Europe,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.394
and I'll find the
complete opposite

00:02:29.394 --> 00:02:30.810
of what's taught
in the classroom.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.080
That Africans have made
a tremendous contribution

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.470
to technology and
many other fields.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.590
That's really what I'm
going to focus on today.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.490
And our Save Nubia
Project-- I have a brochure

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.000
I'll pass around, but
this is the fruits

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.980
of some of my research in Sudan,
in Egypt, and Ethiopia where

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.640
you have classical African
civilizations now, maybe

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.890
ancient Kush and Nubia,
that are under threat.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.000
But since we don't
have a lot of time,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.600
I'll just will move forward.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.080
Anybody know who this-- why
this individual is important,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.860
Dr. Carter G. Woodson?

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:07.680
What is his role?

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.790
What is his contribution?

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.660
Why would I want to
dedicate this presentation

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.530
to Dr. Woodson.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.090
OK, let me help you out.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.940
He's a founder of
what we now call

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.800
African Heritage Month,
or Black History month.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.920
He found, what was then called
Negro History Week, in 1926

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.570
because he said that the
contributions by people

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.530
of African descent really is a
part of US and world history,

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.880
yet these are the missing pages.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.760
And Dr. Woodson
though, back in 1926,

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.350
that it would mean a lot if
we included these pages back

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.695
into the historical text.

00:03:42.695 --> 00:03:46.550
And he's one of the greatest
historians of our time.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:47.830
He's done quite a lot.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.880
I mean he's wrote more than
a dozen books, Dr. Woodson.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.310
His organization,
The Association

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.180
for the Study of African
American Life and History,

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.670
founded in 1915, is
still the leading

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.870
African American historical
organization in the country.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:11.320
Every year, they have
an annual convention.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.467
And the Journal of Negro
History has been updated.

00:04:13.467 --> 00:04:15.550
Now, it's the Journal of
African American history.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.120
It's the leading
journal in the country.

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.649
So we know Woodson quite a lot.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:24.220
And he founded the occasion
more than 88 years ago.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.750
And there was a
stamp in his honor.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.890
And one of his classic books,
he's wrote more than a dozen,

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.090
on the miseducation
of Negroes and really

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.600
focuses on the
American education

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.240
system that really leaves
out students of color,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.850
in particular people
of African descent,

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.130
from their own
contributions to the world.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.310
And so he's one of the great
historians of our time.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.570
So now, you all know
the great Dr. Woodson.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.120
And moving forward--
well, I won't

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.740
to focus on northeast
Africa and contributions

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.427
mainly from ancient Egypt.

00:05:00.427 --> 00:05:02.260
And as you can see,
this is a map of Africa.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.560
And I was there last
year, and I can assure you

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.130
that Egypt did not
detach itself from Africa

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.500
and float off to
the Middle East.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.250
I double checked.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.330
I triple checked.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.020
And when I was in Egypt,
I was on African soil.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.470
So it's still part of
the African continent,

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.250
even today, even thought it's
not really taught that way.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.680
So this is the area here.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.870
So I've done research in
different parts of the world,

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.170
but today, I'll focus
mainly on Egypt.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.490
But a lot of my work
on classical Africa

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.810
has been in Northeast
African corridor.

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.290
And so the three classical
African civilizations

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.610
are Kush, Nubia, and Kemet.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.230
People know Kemet as Egypt.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.750
But this is the Greek word.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.490
And there's no reason really to
use Greek words because we know

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.220
the original word from
the hieroglyphic text.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.312
So we use the word classical
because it's more important

00:05:51.312 --> 00:05:53.100
if you use that
that than ancient.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.965
We here about classical
music, classical--

00:05:54.965 --> 00:06:00.750
what-- classical theater,
classical dance, classical art.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.994
So what does classical mean?

00:06:02.994 --> 00:06:05.160
Why would I put emphasis
on classical and not simply

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.370
ancient.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.510
Even though ancient
civilization-- African

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:12.090
civilization would be
technically correct,

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.140
but what about classical?

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.765
What does the term
actually mean?

00:06:14.765 --> 00:06:15.540
And we do here.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:16.490
We use it.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.390
We read about it.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.890
Anybody?

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:19.580
Yes, sir.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.850
AUDIENCE: Maybe it
stood the test of time.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:22.410
It st--

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:23.730
AUDIENCE: It stood
the test of time.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:24.920
MANU AMPIM: Stood
the test of time.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:25.545
You're correct.

00:06:25.545 --> 00:06:26.680
I like that.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.970
Anybody else?

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:28.620
Yes, sir.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.056
AUDIENCE: It's still relevant.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.180
MANU AMPIM: Still relevant.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.610
Yes, absolutely.

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:33.825
You both are correct.

00:06:33.825 --> 00:06:35.945
So when you say
classical, we mean

00:06:35.945 --> 00:06:38.465
anything that's the standard,
the model, the guide,

00:06:38.465 --> 00:06:40.239
the highest rank,
the highest class.

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:41.530
As you've said, you're correct.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.360
Anything that has permanent
and lasting values.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.940
That's what's
meant by classical.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.730
That's why we call
these classical African

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:51.220
civilizations.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.020
And the oldest of them is Kush.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.260
This a map of Kush.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.630
Kush is the area of
northeast Africa,

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:00.960
but not only northeast
Africa, but across the Red

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.590
Sea into Saudi Arabia and Yemen.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.130
All of this was a part of
the ancient Kushite empire.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:08.980
You can see it
here in the inset.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.020
That's the area.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:12.560
That's the oldest of
the civilizations.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.550
And Kush was based
in modern day Sudan.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.280
That's why I spend a
lot of time in the area.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.460
This is the area where
there's massive pyramids

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.900
and elaborate temples and
great writing and science.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.800
And so most people are
not aware that there's

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.750
twice as many pyramids in
Sudan as there is in Egypt.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.460
Civilization spread from south
to north, not the other way

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:33.975
around.

00:07:33.975 --> 00:07:36.350
And so that's why I've done
extensive, firsthand research

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.335
in order to document this.

00:07:38.335 --> 00:07:41.240
This is one statue
made out of granite.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.570
One of the powerful
Kushite kings.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.410
Can you imagine standing
under a 30 foot statue

00:07:47.410 --> 00:07:50.720
made by one of the most
powerful rulers of the time.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.380
So this is why I
spend so much time

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.660
because the public,
in general, is not

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:57.680
too familiar with these
powerful Kushite rulers.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.620
This is a 2,800 year
old statue here.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.810
And then, also,
some of you possibly

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:06.070
could have seen this image here.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.130
Sometimes, people have it
on posters or handbags.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.520
If you go to the African
flea market in Berkeley,

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.490
I've seen this
sometimes on t-shirts.

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:17.240
But these are Kushite princes.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:22.720
And this is a 3,5000 year
old mural or drawing.

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.590
And we know that they
are high stature,

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:26.920
notice the crowns on their head.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.660
Notice the almond-shaped eyes.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.840
Notice the skin variation.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.360
Here it says in the
glyphs, it says Kush

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.950
so we know where they're from.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.640
Notice the nice
jewelry, the sandals

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.220
who you have the
attendant assisting.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.570
And here you have an assistant
with his arms outstretched.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.810
He has something
draped over this arm.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:49.370
What do you think this might
be that's draped over his arm

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:49.870
here?

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.850
OK.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:54.475
It's an animal.

00:08:54.475 --> 00:08:58.440
Yes, it's a leopard skin outfit
worn by priests and kings

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.600
to what purpose?

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.690
I'm glad you asked.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.220
For the purpose of
rituals and ceremonies.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.300
And then, the same
assistant is carrying--

00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.930
you see three rings,
here another three.

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:11.475
And so three
indicates plurality.

00:09:11.475 --> 00:09:15.750
When something is pleural or
in abundance, you see three.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:17.870
So it means there's a
lot of whatever this is.

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.232
Anybody have an idea
what this would be?

00:09:20.232 --> 00:09:23.040
What is the assistant carrying?

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.735
AUDIENCE: A whole
lot of scrolls?

00:09:25.735 --> 00:09:26.360
MANU AMPIM: OK.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.120
Good try.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.026
Not exactly.

00:09:28.026 --> 00:09:29.900
Something a little more hard.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.110
AUDIENCE: Gold.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.280
MANU AMPIM: Gold.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.760
And there's currently,
right now in 2014,

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.500
there's actually a
gold rush in Sudan now.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.430
Literally, there's
gold everywhere.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:43.700
In fact, the word Nubia-- the
root, nu or nub, it means gold.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:47.420
So Nubia, more likely than
not, means the land of gold.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.335
And now when you go
to Sudan, there's

00:09:49.335 --> 00:09:52.060
people panning for gold
everywhere literally.

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:54.630
So anyway, if we had time,
we would talk about that.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:59.132
But really today, I want to
really talk about the third

00:09:59.132 --> 00:10:00.840
of these classical
African civilizations,

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.110
which is actually listed
on the glyphs here.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.585
So let me point out what
glyphs I'm referring to.

00:10:08.585 --> 00:10:10.820
And it's these glyphs here.

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.970
And this spelled Kemet, or
so called ancient Egypt.

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:16.450
So this is what do you think?

00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:19.650
It's an owl.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.750
Yes, it represents the em sound.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:23.800
And this is a burnt
piece of charcoal.

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.810
This is a half a loaf of bread.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:26.875
This is a crossroad.

00:10:26.875 --> 00:10:29.750
This is where-- it's the
locale where people lived.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:30.990
This the actual name.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:34.040
There's no such name as Egypt
until the Greeks come along

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:34.740
much later.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.850
So many of the
African countries,

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:39.130
these are not original
African names.

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.240
So I just wanted
to point that out.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.895
And all right, let's
focus on writing

00:10:43.895 --> 00:10:46.680
before we deal with more
of the hard sciences here.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:53.770
African contributions in the
field of writing most of us--

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:55.960
Most of us are not
always necessarily

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.830
familiar with the source of
what we have in front of us

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.910
on a regular basis, paper.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:04.385
So this is actual papyrus plant.

00:11:04.385 --> 00:11:05.980
It grows in marshes.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.960
So they would take
the papyrus plant.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.950
And then, they would
cut it into strips.

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.210
And then, they would
eventually make paper.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:16.530
So from papyrus, we
get the word paper.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.195
And this is an
important contribution.

00:11:18.195 --> 00:11:21.050
This is some of the
writing, the text here.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.340
You always read the
text from top to bottom.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.800
This is text inside a pyramid,
so people call it pyramid text.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.150
And even without ever
studying the language,

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:33.250
I bet that most of you can
figure out some of these images

00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:36.580
without ever having taken any
class or seminar or training.

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.970
So for example, this
here is the shenu,

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:42.360
or what people now
call a cartouche.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.720
It's the ring of eternity.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.440
It's the name of the King
you see inside of here.

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.550
But what is this symbol here?

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.090
You see this is not
the best resolution,

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:58.250
but-- it's kind
of pixelated here,

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:02.260
but I guess you can
see-- you see the ears?

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.620
OK, this is a rabbit.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:04.787
This is a ripple of water.

00:12:04.787 --> 00:12:06.120
Anyway, this is the King's name.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.380
What about this?

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.760
There's a bird, yes.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:12.430
An owl, yes.

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:17.120
This is a chick.

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.120
You see this here?

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.730
It's outstretched arms.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:27.730
So if I said to you where is
the place of Memphis in Egypt,

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:28.960
and you say I don't know.

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.816
This means not to
know something.

00:12:31.816 --> 00:12:32.940
But you can make these out.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.315
So we would just
have to give you

00:12:34.315 --> 00:12:37.810
training on what
the sound value is,

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:40.240
but you can actually make
up some of the images

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.300
without taking a class.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.630
But anyway, so I wanted
to show you some of these.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:46.830
And this is scribal
equipment that-- there

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.605
is a scribe's palate.

00:12:48.605 --> 00:12:50.230
And I'm showing this
to you because I'm

00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.880
going to show you
the first writer

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.740
in the history of the world.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:57.960
And these are
actual scribes here

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.090
with their writing
utensil, their board.

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:04.400
This is a scribes equipment.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.480
And so what they have in their
hands is this pallet here.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:13.030
And so you see this
everywhere in Egypt, or Kemet.

00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:15.730
And here's another palate
in different colors.

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.350
The two main colors were
always black and red.

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.240
This man here is a scribe.

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.060
He's a writer.

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:24.570
Does anybody see any
indication of him

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:25.980
being a writer or scribe?

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.285
There is actually three things
that indicates his profession.

00:13:32.392 --> 00:13:34.924
AUDIENCE: He's
writing in his book.

00:13:34.924 --> 00:13:36.340
MANU AMPIM: OK,
great observation.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:37.200
Who said that?

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:37.850
Very good.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:39.090
This is actually a scroll.

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:40.530
You see it's rolled up here.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:42.630
So he's using his
kilt, not a dress.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:43.930
But he's using his kilt.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.820
He's pulling it tight,
his kilt, in order

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.680
to use that as a
writing service.

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.470
You know like when we write,
we usually want something hard.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.270
And then, in his hand,
what's broken off

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:56.840
is the reed in that he
would have been writing.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.227
This is the scroll.

00:13:58.227 --> 00:13:59.810
Here is another
indication of the fact

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:01.240
that he is in fact a scribe.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.642
This is a scribe's palatte.

00:14:02.642 --> 00:14:04.100
This would have
been black and red.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:06.580
So we know his profession
by the symbols,

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:10.220
but also the glyphs tell
us his profession as well.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:15.180
And here you see black and red.

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:18.740
This is actual paintings.

00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.800
This is a stone surface.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.380
But if you notice
that on the left

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.350
is darker than on the right.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.220
Do you see that?

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.900
Any idea why it would
be two different colors?

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.570
You might say maybe one
was exposed to the sun.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:34.070
No, not that one.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:38.520
But notice that this one here
still has the horizontal lines.

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.260
So this is an unfinished piece.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.210
It's not finished.

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:43.620
It is a trial
piece, but it still

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:47.100
is interestingly is
two different colors.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:47.640
Here's why.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:51.980
This is the image that
was drawn by the master.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.410
And to the right is what the
students were practicing on.

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.204
Notice that they were
practicing arm and the hand.

00:14:58.204 --> 00:15:00.620
Notice this one here almost
looks like the thumb is broke.

00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.680
The student did
the best he could

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.910
or she could but-- So they were
practicing an arm and a hand.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.430
You see here they
are practicing.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:08.980
This is the quail chick.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:10.180
And so why is this lighter?

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.609
Because when students practice,
sometimes, they have to erase.

00:15:13.609 --> 00:15:15.025
So that's what
they're doing here.

00:15:15.025 --> 00:15:16.316
They're practicing and erasing.

00:15:16.316 --> 00:15:18.930
But the master is not erasing.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:20.410
And this is a
science by the way.

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:21.210
This is science.

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:23.540
You have a King
sitting on his throne.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:25.980
We know that because
of the sceptor here

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:28.640
in his hand and the
mace, the royal beard,

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.790
his name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:32.820
But not only that,
but what we have here

00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:39.450
is the science as it is
seen by the modern viewer.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.520
So that's from
the soldier's feet

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.660
to the hairline, when they're
seated, it's always 14.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.750
Not sometimes, not most
the times, but always.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:52.230
They could make a small trial
piece into a colossal statue.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.750
And then, it's built
to absolute perfection.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:16:01.270
So if you count, we have
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:04.440
11 12 13 and then
14 at the hairline.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.040
If this was a standing
figure, it would be 18.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:08.600
There's no variation
when this is

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.870
done by royal artists who
are trained by the state.

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:15.140
So we all know rules,
regulations, procedures.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:17.024
They believe that this
is divine art given

00:16:17.024 --> 00:16:18.440
to them by the
creator, so there's

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.800
no such thing as
artistic license.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:22.560
You must follow the rules.

00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:24.690
Anyway, so let me
move forward and show

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.580
you the writer of
the very first book

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.550
in the history of the world.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:30.430
I didn't say one of.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:32.420
The author of the
very first book.

00:16:32.420 --> 00:16:36.610
This is Ptah Hotep and he was
a prime minister, high priest.

00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:39.190
And by the way, no one
could hold high office

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:42.930
like a prime minister, which is
similar to our vice president,

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:46.220
second in line to only the
pharoah, unless the person was

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:48.470
a priest or priestess.

00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:51.390
So they had to be a
spiritual practitioner first.

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:53.520
He's the author of the
world's first book.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.870
This is an image of Ptah Hotep.

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:56.530
Here he is.

00:16:56.530 --> 00:17:00.870
This is about 2,400 BCE,
or before the common era.

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.600
And this is Ptah Hotep
inside of his tomb.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.780
And this is his tomb here.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.480
Here's a close up of his tomb.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.040
So 2,400 BC.

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.440
That's the same as
2,400 years ago.

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.660
And Ptah Hotep
wrote the first book

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.579
in the history of humanity.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:19.529
This is it.

00:17:19.529 --> 00:17:22.530
It's part of the text,
so this is cursive.

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:26.069
So when they wanted to write
fast, like we write in cursive.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:27.700
So they didn't always
write in glyphs.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:31.280
They wrote in glyphs if it
was something on temple walls.

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.930
So what does this contain?

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.900
37 lessons on ethical
or moral conduct.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.310
So the first book ever written
in the history of humanity

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:41.055
had nothing to do with
fighting, warfare, or conflict.

00:17:41.055 --> 00:17:43.250
It was quite the
opposite, presenting

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:46.210
moral and ethical conduct
and social wisdom on how

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:49.880
to avoid conflict, how
to avoid social problems,

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.650
how to show respect for elders.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.110
So now we have two main colors.

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:55.430
We have black and red.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:58.610
Why do you think that you
see intermittent red here?

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:05.230
Why would the author, Ptah Hotep
use red at different places

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:06.330
in his text.

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.330
And by the way, this is a text
used in the school system.

00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:12.720
We know that because
there's different versions

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.100
of this text found
throughout Egypt.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.979
So clearly this is what
young boys and girls

00:18:17.979 --> 00:18:18.770
would have learned.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:22.210
Yeah, girls wrote as well,
and they were taught.

00:18:22.210 --> 00:18:24.460
Red represents a
different lesson.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.062
So whenever you see
red text, that's

00:18:26.062 --> 00:18:29.350
either if it's a medical
document, it's a new case.

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:32.090
If it's a mathematical
document, it's a new problem.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:34.070
But, in this case,
it's moral lessons

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:35.712
taught so it's a new chapter.

00:18:35.712 --> 00:18:36.920
And that's what we have here.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.660
So this is the first
book ever written.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.430
These are the
instructions of Ptah Hotep

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:42.960
if we typed them out.

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.370
And it says, the wisdom
or the maximum Ptah Hotep.

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:52.370
And it says his title as a
so-called prime minister.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:57.220
But anyway, this
is some of the text

00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.310
of Ptah Hotep in
the second stanza.

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:03.040
He's talking about leadership
and that all leaders must

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:03.880
have character.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.070
Character means to build.

00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:08.860
Today, in our
country, a person can

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:11.965
be almost an outlaw,
a former outlaw

00:19:11.965 --> 00:19:14.790
and be a leader
later on, not so much

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:16.160
the case in classical Africa.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:19.090
One must first have
character and everything

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:22.180
was based on Maat, truth,
justice, and righteousness.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:24.490
Just everything
was bound by Maat.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.800
So if we had more time,
I would focus on it more.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.580
But I just want to show you
some of what he talked about.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:33.570
Leadership, known as
Ptah Hotep-- he says,

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.800
do great things which will
be remembered long after you.

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.850
So it's your reputation that
Ptah Hotep is discussing.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:45.740
And not only that,
but he also mentions,

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.090
as all of the wisdom
texts discusses,

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.310
that is hearing well.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.410
He owned the most commonly
used verb in classical Africa

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.570
is the word or the
verb [? sejum ?].

00:19:54.570 --> 00:19:57.800
[? Sejum ?] means to
hear or to listen.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.129
So it's always wisdom text
regarding hearing well.

00:20:01.129 --> 00:20:02.170
And this is what he says.

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:05.240
"If a son and daughter
accept the righteous teaching

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.280
of their parents, none of
their plans will go wrong.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.420
Teach your children, then,
to be those that hear well,

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.870
and they will be valued by
those of weight and substance

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:15.620
and their speech
will be informed

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:16.800
by what they have heard.

00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.170
Respected are those
who listen well."

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:19.920
So think about it.

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.080
We have two ears, two eyes.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.740
But how many mouths?

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:25.450
Just one.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:28.681
So Ptah Hotep reminds us of
how we should communicate.

00:20:28.681 --> 00:20:30.680
Some people don't listen
as well as they should.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.550
That's why I put great
emphasis on listening.

00:20:33.550 --> 00:20:37.990
So that's why you have this as
the most commonly used verb.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:39.590
Anyway, so that's writing.

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:43.260
But I really want to
focus more on math here

00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:46.380
and the other sciences
since we are at Google

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:48.710
and you all deal with
a lot of technology.

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.990
Well, here is the eye
of Heru, or Horus.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.600
And by the way, if you
see words like Horus--

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.020
Some you might know
Isis, these names.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.790
If it ends in is, us,
os, more likely than not,

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:03.530
it is taken on as Grecian form.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:10.320
The original words would
have ended in other letters,

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:12.420
but os, us, is, is
usually the Grecian form.

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.640
So the Greeks couldn't
really pronounce the word,

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.460
so they did the best they could.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.000
So you have the
all-seeing eye of Heru

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.950
in different capacities.

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:23.230
Here is a nice
beautiful bracelet.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:24.480
And this is the eye.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.570
They call it the Uoajat
Eye, or the Sound Eye.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:30.170
It has to do with medicine
but also mathematics.

00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:32.930
So every aspect of
the eye, the eyelash,

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:35.530
every aspect of the eye
represents a fraction.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:38.960
And if you added up these
fractions, it would be 63, 64.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.795
So we believe that this
symbol that you see everywhere

00:21:42.795 --> 00:21:47.862
in Kemet is also the RX symbol
that's used today in pharmacy.

00:21:47.862 --> 00:21:49.320
And there's many
things that we can

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.630
point to to go back to
this area because it's also

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.390
a medical symbol as well.

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:57.500
It's called the Sound Eye
because, in the mythology,

00:21:57.500 --> 00:22:00.500
Heru loses his eye
and, through magic,

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:04.170
Djehuti restores
the eye of Heru.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.950
And so it's also
called the Sound Eye.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:10.990
And so anyway, but we believe
this RX symbol goes back

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:11.490
to that.

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:14.550
But anyway, here's
the Eye of Heru.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:16.290
This is mathematics.

00:22:16.290 --> 00:22:17.702
This is some of the writing.

00:22:17.702 --> 00:22:19.160
You can actually
learn the writing.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.570
One stroke represents one.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.520
Or, you have an arch
here representing 10.

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:33.490
So you can actually, if
you see these images,

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:35.950
you actually can
figure out the writing.

00:22:35.950 --> 00:22:39.790
But nevertheless, this is
a very elaborate system

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:42.130
of writing and numbers
that could be learned.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:44.190
But they were very
sophisticated.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:47.150
So here is the oldest
mathematical text.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:50.290
This text is not
totally complete,

00:22:50.290 --> 00:22:53.190
but it's the oldest
mathematical writings

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:56.510
in the history of the world that
we have on papyrus, or paper.

00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:58.814
It's called the Moscow
Mathematical Papyrus.

00:22:58.814 --> 00:23:00.980
It has nothing to do with
Moscow other than the fact

00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.760
that that's where
it was taken to.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.440
So that's how
history is distorted

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:08.610
when people name documents
based on who found it

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:10.670
or where it happens to be now.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:14.060
There's no reason to call
this the Moscow Mathematical

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:14.560
Papyrus.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.150
Anyways, it's 3,800
year old papyrus.

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:18.720
Here's some of the writings.

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.875
And this is a focus
on calculating

00:23:20.875 --> 00:23:22.980
the volume of a cone or pyramid.

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:26.470
So a lot of those
sophisticated algorithms,

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:27.570
they have an origin.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.070
They don't have an
origin in Greece.

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:34.400
We have it in writing that's
pinned by ancient scribes.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:36.350
So the Moscow document
is very important,

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:40.130
but let me show you one that's
even more popular or famous

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.840
or perhaps even more
important as a much more

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:44.970
complete mathematical document.

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:47.720
In this one here, this is
a copy of a book that's

00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.290
called The Rhind
Mathematical Papyrus,

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:52.940
an ancient Egyptian text.

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:55.610
The only issue here is that
Alexander Rhind purchased

00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:58.830
the document more than 3,000
years after it was written.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:01.450
So why is it now
named after him.

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:05.080
We actually know the name of
the African scribe, Ahmose,

00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.160
who wrote the document.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.820
In fact, Ahmose
made it very clear

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:14.820
that he did not write these
mathematical equations

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:15.730
and create them.

00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:19.640
He was simply copying them
for a much older document.

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.970
Because at 1,600
before the common era,

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:28.230
3,600 years ago, there
was no copy machines,

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:30.600
no fax machines, no scanners.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.400
So what did the scribes do?

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.120
They copied by hand.

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.080
And all Ahmose is
simply saying is

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:39.040
that he followed the
instructions of the pharaoh

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.160
to copy the document,
the much older document

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.260
by hand into the new document.

00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:46.000
And that's why we have his name.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.760
He's not claiming
to know or to be

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:51.460
the one who invented
the knowledge.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.990
So here we have with
this document 87

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:59.190
advanced mathematical problems
without one single error.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:03.080
Trigonometry, calculus,
geometry, arithmetic,

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:07.270
not one single error, and
this is important to know.

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:09.970
So we don't typically
learn these things.

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:15.990
We have to come to a seminar
like this to see the document.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.490
Anybody know where this
document is by the way?

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:20.650
So it's not just
general information.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:21.150
OK.

00:25:21.150 --> 00:25:28.240
Anybody name a famous or
popular museum in England.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.490
AUDIENCE: The Brooklyn Museum.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:30.210
MANU AMPIM: Which one?

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:31.460
AUDIENCE: The Brooklyn Museum.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:34.590
MANU AMPIM: OK, the Brooklyn
museum is a good try.

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:36.680
Yes, you said the--
the British Museum.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.950
I'm going to say we're going
to give you half credit

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:40.546
cause you said b for Brooklyn.

00:25:40.546 --> 00:25:41.920
But it's actually
British Museum.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.760
But good try because
the Brooklyn Museum,

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.900
they do have a lot of material.

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.910
So the British Museum, you're
going to the British Museum.

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:48.770
OK, so the second
part of the test.

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:50.963
What city is it
in, British Museum?

00:25:50.963 --> 00:25:51.830
AUDIENCE: London.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:52.560
MANU AMPIM: OK, it's in London.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.059
All right.

00:25:53.059 --> 00:25:55.210
So you go to London, British
Museum, second floor,

00:25:55.210 --> 00:25:57.880
you'll see the Rhind
Mathematical Papyrus.

00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.290
So all right.

00:25:59.290 --> 00:26:01.637
So 87 advanced
mathematical problems.

00:26:01.637 --> 00:26:02.720
This is how it starts off.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.400
Notice it's a red.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.050
This is the beginning
of the text.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:07.810
And then, you have black.

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:11.407
And the problem
is the word Rhind.

00:26:11.407 --> 00:26:13.490
So I think it's a good
idea to get rid of the name

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:15.570
because it's totally inaccurate.

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:17.930
And why don't we call it
what it should be called.

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:19.430
And what do you
think we should call

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:21.050
it to make it more accurate?

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:21.837
AUDIENCE: Ahmose.

00:26:21.837 --> 00:26:22.670
MANU AMPIM: Why not.

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:24.490
Give Ahmose credit
for what he did.

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:26.460
He copied it from
an older document.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:30.730
And if we take a look at the
beginning of the papyrus here,

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:31.980
this is actually what it says.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:35.370
It's not simply math, but it's
much more deeper than that.

00:26:35.370 --> 00:26:37.100
It says as it starts off here.

00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:38.870
It's almost like a title of it.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:40.970
It says accurate
method of counting

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.690
for grasping the
meaning of things

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:48.530
and knowing everything that
is, all mysteries and secrets.

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:51.180
That's a bad document.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:54.315
So this is how it starts
off, so very powerful.

00:26:54.315 --> 00:26:55.910
All right, so take
a look at this.

00:26:55.910 --> 00:27:01.610
So we know that, in
California, every 10th grader

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:04.660
has to learn the so-called
Pythagorean theorem, which

00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:07.494
is a squared plus b
squared equals c squared.

00:27:07.494 --> 00:27:08.910
This is how it's
always presented.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.310
It is presented in math
classes, social studies,

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:14.810
but we don't always go deeper.

00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:16.780
I do, but most people don't.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.520
So what do we know
about the Pythagoras.

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:20.436
Remember the date I gave
you for the document?

00:27:20.436 --> 00:27:21.690
We'll remind you in a minute.

00:27:21.690 --> 00:27:25.210
But Pythagoras lived about
500 before the common era.

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:28.590
So there's already
an issue here.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:32.030
And the issue about Pythagoras
is that there's no teachers.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:36.480
There's no teachers of geometry
that Pythagoras could've

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.500
benefited from to learned from.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.780
There's no schools of geometry.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.630
There's no books of
geometry in Greece, not one.

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.879
And so where did
he get this from?

00:27:47.879 --> 00:27:50.420
I'll give you the sources, so
if you want to go check it out,

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:51.630
we'll give you the sources.

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:54.170
We know from several
Greek writers themselves

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:56.640
that Pythagoras
left Greece and went

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:59.660
to Egypt, which is in Africa,
and studied for 22 years

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.220
under who?

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:00.959
A priest.

00:28:00.959 --> 00:28:02.500
And that's where he
learned geometry.

00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.940
Then, he goes back to
Greece teaching a subject

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.480
that he didn't
know when he left.

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.920
And so documentation
beats conversation,

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.740
so let's give you
the documentation.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:14.850
Because we can talk about
these things, but let's

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:16.310
give you some of the evidence.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:18.190
Here is Ahmose Papyrus.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:19.920
So this was written 1600.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.100
That's more than 1,000 years
before Pythagoras' mother even

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.272
knew him.

00:28:24.272 --> 00:28:26.230
So how in the wold did
the man create something

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:29.130
that pre-existed 1,000
years before he's around?

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.550
And take a look 87 lessons.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:34.210
And notice, this
is a squared plus

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:36.050
b squared-- we're just
looking at a right

00:28:36.050 --> 00:28:37.890
here on the actual document.

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:38.880
Told you where it was.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.860
You go to the British
Museum, second floor.

00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:41.360
It's there.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.839
Or, you could purchase the book.

00:28:42.839 --> 00:28:44.380
And you can get it
there if you don't

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:45.588
get a chance to go to London.

00:28:45.588 --> 00:28:49.170
So this so-called Pythagorean
theorem has no basis in fact,

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:51.200
so let's get rid of it.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:55.090
What should we call it.

00:28:55.090 --> 00:28:56.980
Why not call it
what it should be

00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:00.410
called it's the Ahmose theorem.

00:29:00.410 --> 00:29:00.910
Right?

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:02.030
This is logical.

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:03.800
We're in a place
where logic reigns.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:06.640
Doesn't it reign
and rule at Google?

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:09.090
This is my assumption
as a guess.

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:12.930
Ya'll are employees so-- it
is how-- don't you think?

00:29:12.930 --> 00:29:14.894
AUDIENCE: Ahmose copied
it from as well though.

00:29:14.894 --> 00:29:17.185
MANU AMPIM: Yeah, but he
copied it from his own people,

00:29:17.185 --> 00:29:20.940
so at least call it the Ahmose
slash ancient Egyptian theorem,

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.550
at least that.

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:25.860
But Ahmose would not have
claimed ownership of it

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.430
because Africans
didn't think that way.

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:31.430
He only said that he was
faithfully following through

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:33.420
on instructions to copy it.

00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.070
But if we're going to pinpoint
individual, and here's

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:36.920
the details.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.365
So that's why this is
very, very important

00:29:39.365 --> 00:29:42.650
to look at the historical
facts and not give credit

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:44.590
where credit is not do.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:49.130
And it's just a very,
but it should come up

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:51.670
with the next slide.

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:53.440
So here's the sources.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.100
So anyway, these are
writers, Greek writers,

00:29:56.100 --> 00:30:00.380
who said the same thing, that
Pythagoras, he goes to Egypt.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.610
He studies for 22
years under a priest.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:05.600
And then, he goes back
teaching geometry.

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.230
So these are the sources
that document that Pythagoras

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:11.780
was specifically learning
mathematics under the priest.

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:13.610
So here you go here.

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:15.730
So anyway, moving forward.

00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:20.330
Architecture, this also
represents science.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:24.200
There's another class
African contribution.

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:28.100
The first known architect
in the history of humanity,

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.856
the one we know by
name, is Imhotep.

00:30:32.856 --> 00:30:34.080
Here he is.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:36.280
The Greeks changed his
name to Escalapius.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.720
So again, look at the ending.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:44.190
And he's also the first known
physician in the world as well.

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:47.490
Almost 2,800 BCE,
Imhotep this is

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.830
an image of him
holding the scroll.

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:53.260
And so, the
Hippocratic Oath, there

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:58.000
are some people who call it the
Imhotepian Oath because Imhotep

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.360
the first known physician
that we know by name.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.570
But I want to focus not
on the medical part,

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:05.500
but on his architectural
contributions.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.120
This here is the
first stone building

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.900
in the history of the world.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.550
This is called the
Step Pyramid today.

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:13.910
People, then, didn't
call it the Step Pyramid.

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:17.120
But somewhere around 2,700
before the common era,

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.060
you have this massive
structure, which

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:20.770
is over 200 feet in height.

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:23.670
And notice that people
today call it a Step Pyramid

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:26.540
because it looks like a
series of steps or benches.

00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:27.870
So this is the first tier.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:29.410
You can see the damage.

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:31.200
The second, third,
fourth, fifth,

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.447
so there's six different tiers.

00:31:33.447 --> 00:31:35.530
And this is the first stone
building in the world.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.585
This is in the
northern part of Egypt.

00:31:37.585 --> 00:31:42.510
The oldest surviving building,
very massive structure.

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:47.980
And here you see it
from another image.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:52.315
But take a close look at
this image in the box.

00:31:52.315 --> 00:31:54.930
These are two people
to give you an idea

00:31:54.930 --> 00:31:56.895
of the size of this
massive monument.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:01.790
So this is the first
superstructure,

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:03.620
some like to call it.

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:07.290
super building in the
world, the first pyramid.

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.090
It definitely takes science.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:10.590
I want to show you
the ones in Giza.

00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:13.270
But inside of this
one, beautiful tile.

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:15.440
So if you go to the
Metropolitan Museum

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:18.090
in New York, which is not that
far from the Brooklyn Museum,

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:19.590
you can see the beautiful tile.

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:23.005
Or if you go to Egypt, you can
see parts of the same tile.

00:32:23.005 --> 00:32:25.140
I can imagine this
in it's heyday.

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:26.980
Beautiful turquoise.

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:27.920
Now, this is inside.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:32.000
There is many different images
inside of the Step Pyramid.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.640
And is built for Zozer.

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.150
This is the king, the
pharaoh, the ruler

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:39.610
who commissioned the building of
that pyramid that you just saw.

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:42.990
He's got his beard, his locks.

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:43.967
The eyes were taken.

00:32:43.967 --> 00:32:45.800
Now, this is part of
the original skin color

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.170
that you would see here.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:49.725
He would have symbols of
authority in his hands.

00:32:49.725 --> 00:32:50.950
Those are broken off.

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:53.410
But this is an
image of Zozer who

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:56.290
commissioned the building
of the pyramid you just saw.

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:58.280
And here's another pyramid.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.910
And all these pyramids
I'm showing you now,

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:04.540
they pre-date, they precede
the first true pyramid.

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:06.650
Because I noticed that
on the history channel,

00:33:06.650 --> 00:33:09.980
they're interviewing
Erich von Daniken.

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.410
This man wrote Chariott
of the Gods decades ago

00:33:12.410 --> 00:33:16.090
and-- have any of you
seen ancient alien series.

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:17.150
Are you kidding me?

00:33:17.150 --> 00:33:19.145
So these people make
us believe that there

00:33:19.145 --> 00:33:22.860
are aliens that left Mars.

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.970
And they went to Africa
to build pyramids.

00:33:24.970 --> 00:33:27.242
And then, they ascended back up.

00:33:27.242 --> 00:33:28.950
That doesn't make any
sense because there

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:30.770
are numerous
pyramid in the area,

00:33:30.770 --> 00:33:32.410
not just the ones in Giza.

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:37.340
So when I take people
on educational tours,

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.140
we look at the evolution
of pyramid building.

00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:42.710
You can see how they went
from the Step Pyramid

00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:46.430
to the Meidum Pyramid,
and then, ultimately,

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:47.350
to the true pyramid.

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:51.260
So you can see that this is an
indigenous, local innovation

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:54.120
and doesn't require some
interplanetary travelers

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.480
to come around and
built for Africans

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.960
what Africans supposedly
couldn't build for themselves.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.540
This is a very steep angle.

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:01.999
No one really knows,
but sometimes,

00:34:01.999 --> 00:34:03.415
in the old literature,
people call

00:34:03.415 --> 00:34:04.740
this the Collapsed Pyramid.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.860
It didn't collapse.

00:34:07.860 --> 00:34:10.480
But, actually, we don't
know what happened.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.040
This is a very steep angle here.

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:17.040
And here's a man to give you
an idea of the size of this.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.659
But this would have been
built in tiers as well.

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:22.949
This is the second one
built after the one in Giza.

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:25.679
I'm sorry the one in Saqqara.

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:26.590
Notice this here.

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:28.210
It's a place called Dahshure.

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:31.690
And notice why people would call
this today the Bent Pyramid.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:33.580
Notice the change in angle.

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.460
This would have been
a very steep angle,

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.820
but it's now in the middle.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:40.480
They changed it to a
more gentler angle.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:44.360
Some think, one theory is
that may be the Meidum Pyramid

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:45.820
so-called collapsed.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:48.780
And the builders were
concerned about the same fate

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:51.520
of this pyramid, and
they change the angle.

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.590
That's plausible, but
we don't really know.

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:55.270
But nevertheless,
we do know that this

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:58.060
was built before
the ones in Giza

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:00.480
that supposedly
the aliens built.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.940
Now, at the same
place of Dahshure,

00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:03.910
there is also the Red Pyramid.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:06.140
This is actually the first
true pyramid ever built

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.380
in the history of the world.

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:11.620
This one here is
about-- this is probably

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:20.360
about-- this is right around
2,600, 2,700, almost 2,700 BCE.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.080
Here you have people
that are walking up

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.896
to enter into the pyramid.

00:35:24.896 --> 00:35:26.270
So if you don't
really know where

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:29.490
you are, if you see an opening,
that's always the north side

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:31.700
because it has the north star.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:34.760
But this is the Red Pyramid.
it's the first true pyramid.

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:39.860
And if you walk up
into the pyramid,

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:43.010
we have to walk up a couple
hundred feet and then, descend.

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:46.600
And so inside of the Red
Pyramid, as they call it,

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.960
you go down about 200 feet.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.280
And then, there's
a series of rooms

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.930
inside of the actual
pyramid as you go down.

00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:57.750
And you enter in from
the stairs to this area.

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:01.790
And there's corbelled ceilings.

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:03.350
So notice that
there's like-- they

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:05.090
call them corbelled
ceilings-- Notice

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:11.090
that these 11 of these part of
the corbelled ceiling about 40

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:11.590
feet high.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.380
And this is graffiti
here, but this

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.860
is inside of the
pyramid where they

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.260
use large blocks of limestone.

00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.080
And this is inside the monument.

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:23.290
This is indigenous African
innovation and architecture

00:36:23.290 --> 00:36:24.552
inside of the Red Pyramid.

00:36:24.552 --> 00:36:26.510
So it had nothing to do
with some people coming

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:28.340
from Mars to do anything.

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:29.130
It's unnecessary.

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:30.490
We can go inside.

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:31.950
There's a series
of three chambers.

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:33.226
This is the first chamber.

00:36:33.226 --> 00:36:35.350
Here's a third chamber as
you leave the second one.

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:36.433
There's a lot of graffiti.

00:36:36.433 --> 00:36:38.880
You get an idea
when people broke

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.890
into the pyramid
looking for treasure.

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:44.200
Somebody here made
up a false year.

00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:45.555
Someone said 1276.

00:36:45.555 --> 00:36:47.080
No, no one broke in here.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.450
This is 1800s.

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:51.220
This person tried to
make his date earlier

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:52.917
than the previous
person, so I guess,

00:36:52.917 --> 00:36:54.500
he thought his name
could last longer.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:55.280
Who knows?

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:57.940
This one is the third corbelled
ceiling more thant 50 feet

00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:58.580
in height.

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:00.360
But anyway, I'm
going to move forward

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:01.610
because I know time is moving.

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:03.250
But I wanted to show
you all of those.

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:06.380
All those pyramids I showed
you were all older than these.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:06.880
Yes, sir.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.350
AUDIENCE: What makes something
the perfect true pyramid?

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:11.330
What's a true pyramid?

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:14.160
MANU AMPIM: Anything
that's a true triangle.

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.410
This is a true triangular shape.

00:37:16.410 --> 00:37:18.660
So that's what we
call a true pyramid.

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:20.140
And you all know these.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:20.900
You've seen these.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:22.608
Some of you might have
traveled to Egypt.

00:37:22.608 --> 00:37:24.940
If you haven't, I know
you've seen these.

00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:28.450
So we're told with the ancient
alien series on the History

00:37:28.450 --> 00:37:31.480
Channel that these
interplanetary travelers came

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.980
and somehow built the monument.

00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:34.220
Doesn't make any sense.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.100
I've shown you all
of the-- I showed you

00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:42.180
pyramids that were built
in the process of coming

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:45.220
to the first true pyramid,
which we saw in Dhashure.

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:49.480
And then, you have the pyramids
of Khufu, Khafre, Menkaura.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:51.190
These massive structures.

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:53.350
And by what these are
the original names.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:55.490
Can you imagine a
monument equivalent

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:57.680
to a 48 story skyscraper?

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.550
So when people say
the great pyramids,

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:01.090
they mean the three
big one's here.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:03.270
Or, if they say
The Great Pyramid,

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:05.640
they mean the one
built for Khufu.

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.820
The Greeks changed
his name to Cheops.

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.080
But this is a massive structure.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:14.390
And then, the one in the middle,
built for Khafre, 471 feet.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:17.040
And then, Menkaura, these
are the three Great Pyramid

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:17.880
builders of Giza.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:21.030
This is about 2,600 BCE.

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:22.230
And notice they're smaller.

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:25.770
I didn't say small, but
simply smaller pyramids here.

00:38:25.770 --> 00:38:29.194
These are smaller, but they're
still massive structures.

00:38:29.194 --> 00:38:30.110
These are people here.

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:31.142
You say I don't really see them.

00:38:31.142 --> 00:38:32.308
That's the point I'm making.

00:38:32.308 --> 00:38:33.990
They're very insignificant.

00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:35.594
These two are people.

00:38:35.594 --> 00:38:36.760
Say I really don't see them.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.870
That's my point.

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:39.370
Trust me.

00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:41.730
There are people over
here somewhere as well.

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:45.020
There is a vast area.

00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:49.730
Let's take a look here
at The Great Pyramid,

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:51.990
the one in the back,
Khufu's pyramid.

00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:57.450
2.3 million stones put in place
without mortar without glue.

00:38:57.450 --> 00:39:00.260
And you have people on camel.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:03.900
2.3 million stone built
over 20 year period.

00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:08.240
You're talking about engineering
and heavy transport techniques.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:10.170
This in me a front
of one of the blocks.

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:14.680
The blocks weighed on
average two and 1/2 tons.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:20.290
On the inside, you
have 15 ton stones.

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:22.270
And take a look here.

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:25.590
So inside, you have--
every pyramid is different.

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:27.830
Every pyramid is different,
different chambers,

00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:29.480
different rooms.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:33.390
And that's what you have inside
of The Great Pyramid here.

00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:37.570
And if you take a closer
look, this is math.

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:41.250
This is geometry on a
sophisticated level.

00:39:41.250 --> 00:39:44.290
This is math demonstrated
on an extraordinary level.

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:46.970
This is all The Great Pyramid/
There's three big ones that we

00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:50.080
just showed you, but this is
The Great Pyramid of Khufu from

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:50.975
different angles.

00:39:50.975 --> 00:39:51.600
But look at it.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.970
It is a perfect triangle.

00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:58.580
And here you can see you've got
a triangle here, a one here.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:01.100
Here's one in the shade
and one on the backside.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.900
If you have four
equilateral triangles

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.470
that gives you a perfect what?

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:06.570
Square.

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:10.740
This is math At a sophisticated
level that stuns the world.

00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:14.320
And by the way, there's an
old proverb the people still

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:18.820
use in Egypt today, that
all the world fears time,

00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:21.200
but time itself
fears the pyramids.

00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:23.110
These monuments were
built for how long?

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:24.104
For eternity.

00:40:24.104 --> 00:40:25.270
And you're looking at these.

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:27.580
Absolutely extraordinary.

00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:30.200
And so these were not
burials by the way.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:32.450
No mummies found
inside, no skeletons.

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:36.310
There was never any attempt for
a burial in these monuments.

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:38.560
These were astrological
observatories.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:43.050
We know that because they-- it
helped them tell time of day.

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:45.420
In fact, you can
tell the time of day

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.890
based on how the sun casts
a shadow on the monument.

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:52.210
You can tell the time of
day, season of the year.

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:53.490
So let's see.

00:40:53.490 --> 00:41:01.680
So for example,
this is the north.

00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.890
This is the north side here.

00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:05.399
This is the south side.

00:41:05.399 --> 00:41:06.190
This would be west.

00:41:08.946 --> 00:41:09.650
I'm sorry.

00:41:09.650 --> 00:41:11.110
This is north, south.

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:12.970
This is east here, sorry.

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:15.460
And this is west on the left.

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:19.230
So given that, this orientation
that I've just mentioned,

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:20.660
what time of day would it be?

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:26.717
Morning, afternoon,
would it be evening?

00:41:26.717 --> 00:41:28.050
AUDIENCE: It would be afternoon.

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:30.050
MANU AMPIM: It'd be
afternoon because the sun is

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.760
on this side.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.020
The sun sets in the west, right?

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:34.950
So its sun is
setting on this side.

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:37.730
So it's casting a shadow
here on the east side.

00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:39.740
So it's clearly
later in the day.

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:43.070
But this is what helped
them set their calendars is

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:45.250
by these monuments.

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:47.040
So there's rituals
and ceremonies,

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.910
but they were not burials.

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:50.770
It makes no sense for
people to say that,

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:53.492
but researchers don't
know all the details,

00:41:53.492 --> 00:41:54.450
so they make up things.

00:41:54.450 --> 00:41:57.380
By the way, when
planes fly above,

00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:00.890
you get these kind of aerial
shots that I'm showing you.

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:03.370
And, definitely
based on science,

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:05.260
if you take a look
here, notice there's

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:07.640
two big pyramids
of Khufu, Khafre.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.280
Menkaura, notice, is
a little bit offline.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.130
Why is it offline?

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:14.340
Because it's consistent
with the Orion star system.

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.360
And the Orion system
is what they actually

00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:20.120
used-- Let me go back here.

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:24.590
But the Orion star
system is what they use.

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:26.900
It's like as above so below.

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.530
So this is deliberately
set off line

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:31.980
because it had to do
with their astrology.

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:35.182
If we had an opportunity to
share with you more, I would.

00:42:35.182 --> 00:42:37.390
But I did a presentation,
an international conference

00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:41.780
in Atlanta, and my presentation
was on the origin and purpose

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:44.400
of Nile Valley pyramid
science to look

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.645
at the evolution of
pyramid building,

00:42:46.645 --> 00:42:48.700
where the idea
came from, and what

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:50.070
was the deep science involved.

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:52.680
But this clearly has
to do with astrology

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:54.870
and also astronomy as well.

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:57.630
By the way, in the back,
you see the city of Cairo.

00:42:57.630 --> 00:43:00.800
And, in fact, in that same
area around The Great Pyramid,

00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:03.990
we find the oldest
surviving asphalt

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:06.810
in the history of the world.

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:10.570
This whole area was
paved with asphalt.

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:12.644
Talk about more than
4,600 years ago.

00:43:12.644 --> 00:43:14.060
Here are people--
just to give you

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:17.660
an idea of the asphalt
that was in the area,

00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:19.210
a whole paved area.

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:22.390
This is a pretty phenomenal
to say the least.

00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:25.770
This is a image of Khufu.

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:30.610
Now, this is in the Brooklyn
Museum, this image here.

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:34.950
And this is thought to be
Khufu the one who commissioned

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:38.000
to building of The Great
Pyramid that you just saw.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.590
This is a red-- this is
pink and red granite.

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:44.330
And the peak is red.

00:43:44.330 --> 00:43:47.970
And now, nobody knows how
the pyramids were built.

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:49.190
No one knows.

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:51.490
It's nothing more
than speculation.

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:54.720
The only evidence that we
have, visual evidence of how

00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:57.570
large stones were
moved is image here

00:43:57.570 --> 00:44:02.390
from the tomb of Djehuti-hotep
Here you have 172 men.

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:04.300
Now, for every time
you see someone here,

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:06.870
it's actually
representing four men.

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:09.150
So if we had a
great image of you

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:12.030
can see it's a person behind
a person behind-- so these are

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:13.900
four for every time
you see someone.

00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.700
And they're pulling ropes.

00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:19.316
You see the different
lines of men.

00:44:19.316 --> 00:44:20.940
They're pulling the
rope, and this rope

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:24.380
is securing this huge
statue of Djehuti-hotep

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:25.920
found in his tomb.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:29.570
Notice this man is pouring
some kind of a liquid.

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:32.370
It's being pulled on the sled.

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:34.470
Why is he pouring the liquid?

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:37.220
To reduce friction.

00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.060
And what is this man
doing here do you think?

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:43.200
See he's on the knees
of the huge statue.

00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:44.270
He's clapping.

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:46.890
Any idea?

00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:48.060
AUDIENCE: Working.

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:49.349
MANU AMPIM: He's?

00:44:49.349 --> 00:44:50.265
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:50.265 --> 00:44:51.680
MANU AMPIM: He's helping.

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.600
Yeah, he's helping in the
sense of creating a rhythm.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.890
The work is a lot easier
when you can sing and dance.

00:44:56.890 --> 00:44:58.490
And that's what's
happening here.

00:44:58.490 --> 00:45:00.090
So he's creating a rhythm.

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:02.420
Anyway, this only
specific information we

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:03.770
have on how they move.

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:06.370
And by the way, the text
says moving a colossus.

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.570
This is the middle
pyramid of Khafre.

00:45:08.570 --> 00:45:12.690
This was complete with
limestone, tura limestone.

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:17.500
This is how it was completed
in the 18th-- In the 1800s

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:20.030
a man named Muhammad
Ali from Turkey

00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:22.510
had his engineers
climb up this pyramid

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:24.570
and strip off the limestone.

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:27.670
Now, it's used for bridges
and mosques around Cairo.

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:31.600
That's why you don't
see this completed now.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.900
But this is math at a
very sophisticated level.

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:37.180
So this what we mean
by a true pyramid.

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:38.477
This is triangular shape.

00:45:38.477 --> 00:45:40.310
There is something
special about this shape.

00:45:40.310 --> 00:45:42.890
It really is.

00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:45.925
And if you see--
this is Khafre who

00:45:45.925 --> 00:45:47.925
commissioned the building
of the middle pyramid.

00:45:50.720 --> 00:45:53.000
And then, the third
of these big pyramids

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.690
is Menkaura and his wife.

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:57.425
Notice the affection.

00:45:57.425 --> 00:45:59.050
You always show a
hand-- there's always

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:01.620
affection between
husband and wife.

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:03.110
Her name looks difficult.

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:05.651
But no, not if you break it into
syllables, Kha-mer-er-nebty.

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:10.060
And notice this is
a beautiful image.

00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:11.270
Notice the left foot forward.

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.936
This is classic.

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:19.550
And so anyway, so these are
these great pyramid builders.

00:46:19.550 --> 00:46:21.940
This is Menkaura's
middle pyramid.

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:24.820
And this is math at a
very sophisticated level.

00:46:24.820 --> 00:46:26.250
And this is the whole area here.

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:27.580
It wasn't built by slaves.

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:29.100
It had nothing to
do with slavery.

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:33.750
These were African astronomers
African astronomer--

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:37.470
astrologers, blue collar
workers, managers,

00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:41.420
scientists who created these
monuments to last for eternity.

00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:43.260
So these are the
three great pyramids.

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:47.680
And this is the place, today,
where a person can go and see

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.340
the evidence of the city of
the ancient pyramid builders

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:55.320
because their tombs are right
in the area near these monuments

00:46:55.320 --> 00:46:56.430
here.

00:46:56.430 --> 00:47:02.640
And so that's what you see in
Giza, these great monuments.

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:05.140
And, on the back
of the dollar bill,

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:07.450
you can see the African
influence there.

00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:17.560
There is this Latin term, he
has favored our undertaking.

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.790
You have other
Latin inscription,

00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:22.450
new order of the ages.

00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:25.710
But which are the ones that
relate to Egypt, you might ask?

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:27.860
Well, the one I mentioned
to you, the eye of Heru.

00:47:27.860 --> 00:47:28.940
Here it is.

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:32.060
This is not-- And
by the way, many

00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:34.260
of the presidents of the
country were stone masons,

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:36.910
including the first
President, George Washington.

00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:38.970
So it's not odd
that they would look

00:47:38.970 --> 00:47:42.000
toward Egypt for
guidance and symbolism.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.510
So many of them were masons,
including the first president

00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:45.330
himself.

00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:47.390
And then, not only the
all seeing eye of Heru,

00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:48.840
but you have the pyramid.

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:50.892
They didn't get these
symbols from Greece, Rome,

00:47:50.892 --> 00:47:51.725
or any other places.

00:47:51.725 --> 00:47:54.000
These are pyramid--
symbols from Egypt,

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.640
so you have a lot of
the influence there.

00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:00.610
And these are not only Masonic
symbols, but this is science.

00:48:00.610 --> 00:48:03.870
Take a look at this
massive structure here.

00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:06.730
This is Ramses' image.

00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:13.610
And you don't see anybody
here, but if you look closely,

00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:15.172
now you do.

00:48:15.172 --> 00:48:15.880
Look at the size.

00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.990
It's a 65 foot high monument.

00:48:17.990 --> 00:48:21.300
And this temple was carved
from the mountain behind it.

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:22.630
Each one of these are Ramses.

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:26.780
He's the greatest builder
in history of Africa.

00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:30.660
And you're standing
right underneath Ramses.

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:32.666
Let me show you the
science involved here.

00:48:32.666 --> 00:48:34.040
This is why I'm
showing you this.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:36.900
Here's one of the
sons of Ramses.

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:37.590
What a builder!

00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:41.156
This is about 3,200 years ago.

00:48:41.156 --> 00:48:42.904
Can you imagine?

00:48:42.904 --> 00:48:44.320
Now, this is inside
of the temple.

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:47.460
Ramses is given his
crown as the king.

00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:50.970
And then, inside of
the temple, if you

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:55.710
go through a series of
rooms, about 180 feet back

00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:58.170
into the inner
sanctuary, the sun

00:48:58.170 --> 00:49:01.510
creeps in and lights up the
statues in the back only

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:02.810
twice a year.

00:49:02.810 --> 00:49:04.490
This is science at it's best.

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:09.110
So there's a mad rush, usually,
on February 22nd and October

00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:09.910
22nd.

00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:13.100
Early morning, 4:00 AM,
people go to Abu Simbel

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:14.805
to see one of the
great phenomenons

00:49:14.805 --> 00:49:16.430
in the world, where
the scientists were

00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:21.320
able to orient the temple that
the sun creeps in 180 feet

00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:25.040
and into the back of the
temple and lights up these four

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.220
statues only twice a year.

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:31.880
That science because the sun,
it shines off of the Nile and it

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:33.140
lights up these statute's.

00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:35.205
Early morning, people
go to Abu Simbel.

00:49:35.205 --> 00:49:38.340
They spend the night to see
one of the great phenomenons.

00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:41.270
But can you imagine the
knowledge of astrology

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:43.600
to be able to do
that and to orient

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:45.009
the temple in exactly that way?

00:49:45.009 --> 00:49:47.050
This is one of the great
structures in the world.

00:49:47.050 --> 00:49:48.674
Let me show you the
Karnak Temple here.

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:55.440
You see this is the sacred lake.

00:49:55.440 --> 00:49:57.680
This is part of the-- Anybody
see any structures here

00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:00.808
that might be familiar to us?

00:50:00.808 --> 00:50:01.775
AUDIENCE: Obelisks.

00:50:01.775 --> 00:50:02.400
MANU AMPIM: OK.

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:02.900
Obelisks.

00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.602
And they're where?

00:50:04.602 --> 00:50:05.750
AUDIENCE: On the right.

00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:07.000
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK, very good.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.140
Here's one.

00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:09.150
Here's the other one.

00:50:09.150 --> 00:50:10.760
So notice this.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:13.900
So here you have Obelisks
at the Karnak temple.

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:14.690
Here are two.

00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:17.460
This one is built by
Hatshepsut, Queen Hatshepsut.

00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:22.730
This is 97 feet,
estimated 320 tons,

00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:24.470
made out of one single
block of granite.

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:26.950
Here's another one
here, a third one.

00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:28.600
But take a look here.

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:33.010
This is the Tekhen, what people
now call the obelisk, 1,500

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:36.280
before the common era,
or 3,500 years ago.

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.170
Look similar?

00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:38.740
This is the Washington Monument.

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:42.010
Notice the reflecting pool.

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:43.860
And this was built for
Georgia Washington,

00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:47.560
but if you take a look at
the dates, this is in 1884.

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.950
This is thousands
of years later.

00:50:49.950 --> 00:50:52.260
George Washington and others,
as we said a minute ago,

00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:53.960
they were masons.

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:58.290
So this is why we
get this image.

00:50:58.290 --> 00:51:01.970
So you have the original
and you have a copy.

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:04.080
Could there be any coincidence?

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.440
Absolutely not.

00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:06.440
Absolutely not.

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:09.490
The most people don't connect
this great U.S. monument

00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:13.230
to an African source, but
that's the reality of it.

00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:14.870
You see it right there.

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:18.830
And let me just end by
showing you-- so the science,

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:21.870
we could say more, but,
just in case, you might say,

00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:25.340
ah science is good, but why
do you connect it to Africa.

00:51:25.340 --> 00:51:28.170
OK, well, let's
address that issue here

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:30.610
whenever this comes up.

00:51:30.610 --> 00:51:34.360
This is the greatest statue
on Earth, the most well-known,

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:37.100
the most famous statue
in history of the world.

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:38.610
You know it as the Great Sphinx.

00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:40.860
The original name
is Heru-em-akhet,

00:51:40.860 --> 00:51:43.510
or the god Heru in the horizon.

00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:45.200
Notice that it's in Giza.

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.050
So this is the Great
Pyramid of Khufu.

00:51:48.050 --> 00:51:49.400
This is the one in the middle.

00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:52.270
If you go down the hill,
here's this monument here.

00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:54.070
Here you can see it.

00:51:54.070 --> 00:51:55.510
It's down the hill.

00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:57.202
This is a man.

00:51:57.202 --> 00:51:57.910
Give you an idea.

00:51:57.910 --> 00:52:00.440
This is a 66 foot high monument.

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:02.750
As you can see, it
has a head of a person

00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:06.620
and the body of a
lion 240 feet long.

00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:09.460
This is the greatest and most
well-known statue on earth.

00:52:09.460 --> 00:52:11.640
But I'm showing you
this because most times

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:15.020
you see the front view,
where, obviously, there's

00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:16.660
deliberate nose damage.

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:20.155
Some people think Napoleon
trained his canons

00:52:20.155 --> 00:52:21.010
to blow it off.

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:21.830
I think not.

00:52:21.830 --> 00:52:24.010
That would have been a
heck of a cannon shot.

00:52:24.010 --> 00:52:27.550
I think, more likely, they
sawed it off, but not Napoleon.

00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:32.215
The nose was missing long before
Napoleon in around 1799, long

00:52:32.215 --> 00:52:33.270
before that.

00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:36.440
But what we don't often
see is the profile view.

00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:40.840
You don't often see the
Africoid profile view.

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.322
Because even with
the nose missing,

00:52:42.322 --> 00:52:44.530
notice the cheek bones
notice-- uh oh, there they go.

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:46.530
Notice the juicy kissing lips.

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:49.000
These lips are meant for
smooching and affection.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.230
And this is clearly
an Africaoid image,

00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:53.340
but you don't normally
see the profile view.

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:54.980
But here it is.

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:55.810
That's it.

00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:58.299
And so I have many
other images of this,

00:52:58.299 --> 00:52:59.340
but that one you can see.

00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:03.190
So the most well-known statue
in the world, you see it.

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:05.490
It's Africoid.

00:53:05.490 --> 00:53:07.320
And there's a reason
why people don't often

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:09.260
get a chance to see the
profile view because how do you

00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:09.960
explain this.

00:53:12.491 --> 00:53:12.990
All right.

00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:14.150
Let me show you other images.

00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:15.160
That's not enough for you.

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:16.368
You all are a tough audience.

00:53:16.368 --> 00:53:17.930
So let's show you
some other images.

00:53:17.930 --> 00:53:19.007
The tomb of Kagemni.

00:53:19.007 --> 00:53:21.090
Most people don't go there,
but I take every group

00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:22.610
to Kagemni's tomb.

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:25.810
And this is a tomb that
around the time of Ptah Hotep.

00:53:25.810 --> 00:53:28.570
If you have noticed, the color
is off here on the projector.

00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:32.010
But this is more
reddish than brown here.

00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:35.030
But you have different
color images.

00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:38.960
When they wanted to juxtapose
one person to another.

00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:42.570
But notice they didn't use
any really light colors.

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:45.480
Now on the tomb of
Ramses III, I want--

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:47.670
this is the King's
Valley Tomb number 11.

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:49.720
That's what KV stands for.

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:54.020
And this is about 1200
BCE, or 3,200 years ago.

00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:55.020
What do you notice here?

00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:59.030
Notice you see a
person a and what else?

00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.770
Person c.

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:00.392
Noticed this.

00:54:00.392 --> 00:54:01.850
This is interesting
because they're

00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:04.800
dressed-- They're jet black
and dressed identical.

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:09.070
This is actually in
the tomb of Ramses III.

00:54:09.070 --> 00:54:11.730
This is how the artist
depicted themselves.

00:54:11.730 --> 00:54:15.890
This says here ramesh,
or it just means people.

00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:17.600
It just means the
people of Egypt.

00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:22.630
This here says Nahesi.

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:25.110
Nahesi just means
those to the south.

00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:26.940
So it's interesting
that the people

00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:30.340
in Egypt, the artist in
this case, in a royal tomb--

00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:31.770
this is not some side artist.

00:54:31.770 --> 00:54:33.910
This is a royally
trained artists,

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:36.890
depicted the people in Egypt
jet black and identical

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:40.060
to other Africans
from the South.

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:43.660
So KV 11, if you get a chance to
go, you want to check that out.

00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:44.490
You can see.

00:54:44.490 --> 00:54:47.880
But not only that, but
there's other things too.

00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:50.160
Someone said, well,
those images don't exist.

00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:51.310
Are you kidding me?

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:53.540
This is inside of
the tomb itself.

00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:56.160
And you still have the
same black skin images.

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:59.159
So KV 11.

00:54:59.159 --> 00:55:00.450
Now, what do you think this is?

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:02.491
I want to end by just
showing you a couple slides

00:55:02.491 --> 00:55:03.566
and I'm done.

00:55:03.566 --> 00:55:05.320
I just want to show
you the identity.

00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.290
What do you think this is?

00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:07.790
Comb.

00:55:07.790 --> 00:55:08.550
What kind of comb?

00:55:12.030 --> 00:55:12.680
It has a pick.

00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:13.860
Afro pick.

00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:16.729
And our hair-- sometimes
the teeth are broken.

00:55:16.729 --> 00:55:17.770
You know in the old days?

00:55:17.770 --> 00:55:20.890
You know when people--
so just if you

00:55:20.890 --> 00:55:24.240
look at one line of evidence,
you can indicate the identity.

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.880
Sometimes, people say, yes,
I agree it's a high culture,

00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:29.470
but I don't think it has
anything to do with Africans.

00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:32.320
Well, let's address that issue.

00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:35.020
If you just look
at combs and hair,

00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:36.650
we can address that as we close.

00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:38.540
Here is sister [? Hanoop ?].

00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:39.480
What is she doing?

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:41.030
She's braiding hair.

00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:44.650
This is the hieroglyphic image
for just that, braiding hair.

00:55:44.650 --> 00:55:46.840
This is an African hairstyle.

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:48.877
People often say, I
love your French braids.

00:55:48.877 --> 00:55:51.460
Well, it actually doesn't have
anything to do with the French.

00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:53.090
This is African hairstyle.

00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:56.670
It goes back many thousands
of years as you see here.

00:55:56.670 --> 00:56:00.600
Take a look at this beautiful
image of a princess.

00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:02.920
Notice she has her
jewelry, a bouquet,

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:05.660
the almond-shaped
eyes, and, yes, you

00:56:05.660 --> 00:56:08.260
have the beautiful
braided hair, and a linen

00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:13.930
outfit because people wear
linen a lot when it's very hot.

00:56:13.930 --> 00:56:17.490
Not only that, take a
look at Queen Thepu.

00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:21.450
Notice the beautiful
skin tone, the jewelry,

00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:23.630
almond-shaped eyes.

00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:26.780
And they wore wigs sometimes.

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:30.040
This is more likely her hair,
but when they did wear wigs,

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:32.400
it is always human hair.

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:35.970
And notice how
beautiful it is here.

00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:40.530
Not only that, but you
can look at other images.

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:42.930
Here, this one is a wig here.

00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:45.630
But it's Ahmose-Nefertari,
She is always

00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:47.650
depicted in this manner.

00:56:47.650 --> 00:56:49.260
Notice her symbols of authority.

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:53.130
This is her name, so
a high-level queen.

00:56:53.130 --> 00:56:55.424
But the wigs are
always human hair.

00:56:55.424 --> 00:56:56.840
But not only that,
but take a look

00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:59.320
at how kings are represented.

00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:01.740
This is Amenemhet III.

00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:07.600
And so running the nation, he
was a king of the 12th dynasty.

00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:11.080
He has on locks
here, very powerful.

00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:13.630
And so tell rasta that we
appreciate the culture,

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:16.640
but the rasta didn't
originate the dreads.

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:18.430
You them right here.

00:57:18.430 --> 00:57:20.910
This is in the Cairo museum.

00:57:20.910 --> 00:57:23.960
Amenemhet IIII, a
very powerful ruler

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:26.600
who ruled doing a very
important time period.

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:28.630
This is the image
of the first known

00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:31.340
dentist in the
history of humanity.

00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:35.330
The first known dentist
by name, Hesy-Re.

00:57:35.330 --> 00:57:37.580
And notice he had--
this is not a wig.

00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:38.800
This is his hair.

00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:40.570
This is fro.

00:57:40.570 --> 00:57:43.380
And Hesy-Re, when you go
into the Cairo Museum,

00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:46.310
he is off to the side.

00:57:46.310 --> 00:57:50.260
Most of the guys walk
right past Hesy-Re.

00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:51.750
And unless the
person is curious,

00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:55.460
they have to actually
go behind a little area

00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:56.980
to look at the
Hesy-Re paintings.

00:57:56.980 --> 00:58:00.472
There are 6 of these that
have been found from his tomb.

00:58:00.472 --> 00:58:02.870
Third dynasty, this
is about 2,800 BCE.

00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:05.220
He's the first known
dentist that we

00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:09.230
know of by name in the
history of the world.

00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:11.650
Notice the helical
structure of the hair.

00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:13.980
This is clearly
in Africoid image.

00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:16.400
There's a couple
more images here.

00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:19.700
You have wigs in the Cairo
Museum worn by priests.

00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:22.020
Notice these Afro wigs.

00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:27.060
Notice even the dolls they
played with, even the beads

00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:27.910
representing what?

00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:30.910
Braided hair.

00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:34.780
This one line of evidence
here, just hair, combs.

00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:36.460
And this is a man.

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:38.140
Here's King Tut.

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:39.660
These are statue in his tomb.

00:58:39.660 --> 00:58:45.300
This is original golden
mask of Tutankhamen.

00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:48.157
[INAUDIBLE] gold found
on his mummy about 3,300

00:58:48.157 --> 00:58:52.480
in-- Did anybody go to the King
Tut exhibit at the de Young?

00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:53.120
Yes.

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:56.290
And so you went to the--
so this is Tutankhamen.

00:58:56.290 --> 00:58:58.510
This is his mother Queen Tiye.

00:58:58.510 --> 00:59:00.277
Now, if the new DNA
tests are correct,

00:59:00.277 --> 00:59:01.610
and we don't know that they are.

00:59:01.610 --> 00:59:03.930
But if they are, that,
instead of his mother,

00:59:03.930 --> 00:59:05.790
this would be his grandmother.

00:59:05.790 --> 00:59:08.740
Either way it's still all in
the family, Africoid family.

00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:10.960
I'm just showing you
someone that everybody

00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.850
is familiar with.

00:59:12.850 --> 00:59:14.710
If this is not his
father, Amenhotep III,

00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:19.090
it would be his grandfather,
still all in a family.

00:59:19.090 --> 00:59:24.010
And then, this is Tutankhamen,
original images of him.

00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:28.500
And then, finally, this is
what was in the exhibit.

00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:31.360
You might recall this
image of Tutankhamen.

00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:37.060
This is like a mannequin
of Tutankhamen.

00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:42.675
And finally, this is just a
brief, very brief information

00:59:42.675 --> 00:59:46.070
that I wanted to share with
you about African contribution

00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:47.520
in math and science.

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:48.660
And thank you very much.

00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:49.997
I'm Professor Manu Ampim.

00:59:49.997 --> 00:59:50.830
Thank you very much.

00:59:58.312 --> 01:00:00.020
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank
you all for coming.

01:00:04.683 --> 01:00:05.974
Did anybody have any questions?

01:00:05.974 --> 01:00:06.474
Yeah.

01:00:06.474 --> 01:00:08.100
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
have a question.

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:09.835
You said a couple
time, yeah this

01:00:09.835 --> 01:00:13.228
is the first book or the
first stone building.

01:00:13.228 --> 01:00:14.715
When you say it,
you mean like this

01:00:14.715 --> 01:00:16.131
is the first one
that you know of?

01:00:16.131 --> 01:00:18.611
Or, you actually
have people who are

01:00:18.611 --> 01:00:20.360
saying oh this is
literally the first time

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:21.755
anybody's seen this here.

01:00:21.755 --> 01:00:25.110
We have the record of that
this was created, [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:26.770
MANU AMPIM: The
first we know of.

01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:28.230
Yes, the first we know of.

01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:30.640
And that's how I typically
try to explain it.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:33.050
But yeah, good ques--
first we know of.

01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:35.240
It's like because--
Like, for example,

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:40.779
when we see Imhotep as
the first known architect,

01:00:40.779 --> 01:00:42.820
but he just pops up and
there's a great building.

01:00:42.820 --> 01:00:45.362
So we have to assume there has
to be some period before that.

01:00:45.362 --> 01:00:46.570
AUDIENCE: We just don't know.

01:00:46.570 --> 01:00:48.534
MANU AMPIM: Yeah, we
just don't know exactly.

01:00:48.534 --> 01:00:49.490
Yes?

01:00:49.490 --> 01:00:51.980
AUDIENCE: It's just the
color in the paintings

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:54.842
really didn't
necessarily represent

01:00:54.842 --> 01:00:56.750
the color [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:00.895 --> 01:01:01.520
MANU AMPIM: OK.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.335
With this--

01:01:03.335 --> 01:01:04.980
AUDIENCE: Like the
red and the black.

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:13.450
MANU AMPIM: But this,
as you see, is pixelated

01:01:13.450 --> 01:01:15.210
and the colors are all off.

01:01:15.210 --> 01:01:16.667
But outside of that,

01:01:16.667 --> 01:01:19.000
AUDIENCE: I mean that the
people that are in the-- yeah.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.041
MANU AMPIM: Yeah, I know.

01:01:20.041 --> 01:01:22.120
And I just wanted to say
that so-- the colors are

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.420
off of what you're seeing here.

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:24.628
I don't know what's going on.

01:01:24.628 --> 01:01:29.760
But anyway, people like to
say that this is stylized.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.825
In other words, it's
stylized or idealized.

01:01:32.825 --> 01:01:35.200
It's not really how
the people looked.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.200
And so people like
to-- actually,

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.640
if you take a look at--
maybe it's my eyes.

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:44.780
That one looks closer
to the original here.

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:46.280
It's not just me, is it?

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:47.444
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:01:47.444 --> 01:01:48.390
AUDIENCE: That one's
probably redder.

01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:50.200
MANU AMPIM: Yeah, this
is more authentic.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.937
I should have been--
should have turned

01:01:51.937 --> 01:01:53.850
a-- I should have
walked to the back.

01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:55.270
So that's more accurate.

01:01:55.270 --> 01:01:58.170
But that argument
that oh the people

01:01:58.170 --> 01:02:00.700
were depicted that way,
that it's idealized.

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:04.080
No, because of if you see
one image of Tutankhamen,

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:04.680
you can tell.

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:07.150
If we had a collage
of different images,

01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:09.020
you would always be
able to pick him out.

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:12.292
Because these people try
to say they idealized him.

01:02:12.292 --> 01:02:13.500
People didn't look like that.

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.820
No.

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:17.040
You can see, specifically,
in the paintings

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.980
and the sculpture.

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:20.290
It's exactly how they look.

01:02:20.290 --> 01:02:21.530
Mummies have been found.

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:23.620
They've been depicted
by other groups as well.

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:25.390
It is very consistent.

01:02:25.390 --> 01:02:27.390
People try to get around
that because they would

01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:29.910
like the public to think
that this had nothing

01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:33.990
to do with Africa, and
these dark skinned images

01:02:33.990 --> 01:02:35.520
are really not the reality.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:39.490
So now what people tried
to do is use forensic art

01:02:39.490 --> 01:02:41.420
to come up with some
brand new images

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:42.880
of how the people looked.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.130
And it's not necessary to
do that because we have

01:02:45.130 --> 01:02:49.300
from his tomb, for example,
there's more than 5,000 items.

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:51.440
And most of them have
images of Tutankhamen.

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:52.815
And they're very,
very consistent

01:02:52.815 --> 01:02:58.680
not only from his tomb, but from
other images of him as well.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.616
So the idea-- this argument
that this is idealized

01:03:01.616 --> 01:03:04.790
and they just happen to
look African is really not.

01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:06.995
AUDIENCE: That wasn't
really where I was going.

01:03:06.995 --> 01:03:07.742
MANU AMPIM: OK.

01:03:07.742 --> 01:03:08.242
All right.

01:03:08.242 --> 01:03:09.908
AUDIENCE: Where do
you feel [INAUDIBLE]?

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.870
I'm trying to think
of the one shown where

01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:17.533
was sort of like some of them
were black, and some of them

01:03:17.533 --> 01:03:20.523
were red, and some
of them were yellow.

01:03:20.523 --> 01:03:22.856
In those pictures, and you
were saying that [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:26.279 --> 01:03:30.338
And so I was just-- I have heard
that that represents patience.

01:03:30.338 --> 01:03:32.780
It doesn't necessarily
represent the color

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:36.467
that the people that wrote
them colored them to be.

01:03:36.467 --> 01:03:36.966
[INAUDIBLE].

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:41.444
You know what I'm
talking about now?

01:03:41.444 --> 01:03:42.610
MANU AMPIM: Yeah, let's see.

01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:44.020
You might be-- let
me show you two.

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.980
I think you might be familiar
with the Table of Nations.

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:47.025
This is the one on Kush.

01:03:47.025 --> 01:03:49.820
You're not talking
about that one, right?

01:03:49.820 --> 01:03:51.725
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's
a pretty good one.

01:03:51.725 --> 01:03:52.000
MANU AMPIM: OK.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.470
If we use this one, this is
exactly how the people look.

01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:55.750
Exactly.

01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:59.510
In fact, if anybody goes to
Sudan today, or the heartland

01:03:59.510 --> 01:04:01.780
of Kush, people look
exactly like that.

01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:03.890
There is various
shades of brown.

01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:06.480
There is like the black color.

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.850
It's various shades of black.

01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:08.700
There's chocolate.

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:13.190
There's a gray black blue, a
blue black, super black, wild

01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:15.604
black, amazing
black, perfect black.

01:04:15.604 --> 01:04:16.270
I mean in Sudan.

01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:18.000
AUDIENCE: The color is
also better back there.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.333
MANU AMPIM: This is much better.

01:04:19.333 --> 01:04:20.920
Yeah, that's much, much there.

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:25.090
But that's exactly how-- so
when I first went to Sudan,

01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:26.900
I really didn't
know what to expect.

01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:30.140
So it makes sense
to me-- and besides,

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:34.170
the people who named the
place the Lot El Sudan, that's

01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:37.159
an Arab phrase meaning
land of the blacks.

01:04:37.159 --> 01:04:38.450
That's literally what it means.

01:04:38.450 --> 01:04:41.040
Even the term Ethiopia,
is a Greek term which

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.230
means burnt face, blackface.

01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:44.760
or kissed by the sun.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:48.920
So those images that you
actually see are very accurate.

01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:52.540
The people in Sudan
and Nubians-- Nubians

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:54.650
are in southern Egypt
and northern Sudan.

01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:57.880
You can see those
variations even today.

01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.690
And not only that,
but, the other one

01:04:59.690 --> 01:05:03.487
that you mentioned,
they're very specific.

01:05:03.487 --> 01:05:04.570
They're very specifically.

01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:07.160
The artists were
very, very detailed

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:11.300
in how they portrayed
things, not only people,

01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:15.280
but they are so specific you
can see the species of plants,

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:18.450
the species of fish,
because they were very, very

01:05:18.450 --> 01:05:20.530
detailed in how they present it.

01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:24.970
So here, when you
see-- there's better,

01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:28.810
but how the people dress,
their attire, the details,

01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:32.110
their beards, all these
things are very accurate.

01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:33.640
And this is how
we're able to tell

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:39.240
not only from the inscriptions,
but how they're depicted.

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:42.660
So they really didn't-- They
were not loose with how they

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:44.090
portrayed people.

01:05:44.090 --> 01:05:46.929
But some have said these
are just generalized.

01:05:46.929 --> 01:05:47.970
They are not generalized.

01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:49.460
They are very specific.

01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:51.760
And that's why a person
goes to a museum,

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.890
they can see that,
in many cases,

01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:58.960
you go to different museums,
there's no name of the person.

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:02.140
And the location, it will
say provenance unknown.

01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:04.030
In other words,
there are assuming

01:06:04.030 --> 01:06:06.540
that this statue represents
that person because

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:10.640
of the stylistic--
specific stylistic details.

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:13.310
And because of that, they
say it must be this person.

01:06:13.310 --> 01:06:17.497
You see that many times, assumed
to be King such and such.

01:06:17.497 --> 01:06:19.830
And they say provenance unknown
because they don't know.

01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:22.190
They bought it from somebody.

01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:25.600
And how could they assume who
it is if they all look alike.

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:27.680
No, it's very specific.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:31.540
And you can see the variations
of skin tone, dress.

01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:33.060
So that's a whole
other argument,

01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:35.422
but it's actually a
great question though.

01:06:35.422 --> 01:06:37.902
Yes, sir.

01:06:37.902 --> 01:06:41.374
AUDIENCE: You said no one knows
how the pyramids were erected.

01:06:41.374 --> 01:06:45.164
Then, you also said that it
wasn't constructed by slaves.

01:06:45.164 --> 01:06:46.830
Is there evidence
some way or the other?

01:06:46.830 --> 01:06:47.705
MANU AMPIM: Oh, yeah.

01:06:47.705 --> 01:06:51.870
There's clear evidence that it
was not constructed by slaves.

01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:53.600
And let me show you here.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:54.490
Good question.

01:06:54.490 --> 01:06:56.560
Let me show this place here.

01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:02.030
I took out a lot of
slides, but this place here

01:07:02.030 --> 01:07:04.910
Nazlet El-Semman And
this location here,

01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:11.330
as of 1992, the Giza mapping
project led by Mark Lehner,

01:07:11.330 --> 01:07:16.830
we now know the tombs have been
found of the actual pyramid

01:07:16.830 --> 01:07:17.720
builders.

01:07:17.720 --> 01:07:20.480
We know their titles,
what days they worked,

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:21.700
what days they had off.

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:25.040
So they would work 7 days
and then have 3 days off.

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:25.790
That was a week.

01:07:25.790 --> 01:07:28.220
So a week was a 10 day period.

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:29.550
So there were 3 10 day weeks.

01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:33.160
They worked 7 days, 3 days
off, work 7 days, 3 days off,

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:34.760
work 7 days off.

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:37.120
We know they were paid with
grains of wheat, grains

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.980
of barley, and with linen cloth.

01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:41.760
So the records were very clear
that these were paid laborers,

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:45.020
that no one was involved
in forced labor.

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:49.450
So the place of Nazlet
El-Semman since '91-- actually,

01:07:49.450 --> 01:07:54.240
since '92, now, the slavery
argument it has no weight.

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:56.520
Before that, people argued
it without evidence.

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.920
Now, the argument can't
be advanced anymore

01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:01.800
because of the evidence
at Nazlet El-Semman

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:05.600
and knowing when people were
paying and how they were paid.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:06.469
Yeah?

01:08:06.469 --> 01:08:08.010
AUDIENCE: So there's
evidence for all

01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:09.470
the different positions?

01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:10.913
MANU AMPIM: Yes.

01:08:10.913 --> 01:08:12.746
AUDIENCE: I thought
that's why they depicted

01:08:12.746 --> 01:08:15.500
the different or other
people pulling the sled.

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.860
And there's the
keeper or something.

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:20.922
But I thought that all
the people were paid.

01:08:20.922 --> 01:08:22.130
MANU AMPIM: Yeah, absolutely.

01:08:22.130 --> 01:08:25.020
So you have evidence of--
because there's tombs.

01:08:25.020 --> 01:08:27.100
Because when
somebody has a tomb,

01:08:27.100 --> 01:08:31.010
the tomb is the person--
like a tombstone today,

01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:33.680
it would have the person's
name, when they were born,

01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:35.010
when they passed away.

01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:38.149
But there is a big tomb where
it indicates all their life

01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:40.270
achievements, but
also their titles,

01:08:40.270 --> 01:08:41.630
the titles of family members.

01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:44.180
So we know the titles,
what they claim

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:45.550
to accomplish in their life.

01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:47.770
And you see that at
that location there,

01:08:47.770 --> 01:08:52.024
there's-- what's been found
is the bakery, the brewery,

01:08:52.024 --> 01:08:55.010
the tombs, their titles.

01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:56.069
So they're all laid out.

01:08:56.069 --> 01:08:58.020
And not only their
titles, but also

01:08:58.020 --> 01:09:03.880
how the-- they call it
a [? zha ?] or people

01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:07.042
translate it as a gang,
not a gang of thugs,

01:09:07.042 --> 01:09:08.340
but a gang of workers.

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:11.229
How they were organized
to do the work.

01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:13.370
So, usually, they would
work in 3 month shifts.

01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:15.819
And then, they would go
back into their communities.

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.819
So that it was a
public works project

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:19.760
built by Africans stonemasons.

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:23.220
And in fact, there was communal,
cooperative, and collective

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:24.699
public works projects.

01:09:24.699 --> 01:09:25.990
It had nothing do with slavery.

01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:29.285
But those tombs, and the
titles, and how and when people

01:09:29.285 --> 01:09:33.816
were paid, that sealed
the case of '92.

01:09:33.816 --> 01:09:34.649
AUDIENCE: --comment.

01:09:34.649 --> 01:09:37.649
Wasn't there a documentary
made when they were excavated?

01:09:37.649 --> 01:09:39.080
MANU AMPIM: Yes, it was.

01:09:39.080 --> 01:09:41.939
And if you look up
Mark Lehner, they had--

01:09:41.939 --> 01:09:44.020
So Mark Lehner's
got these theories

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:45.620
of how the pyramids were built.

01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:49.790
And so this is when the
Discovery Channel showed it.

01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:52.890
They had a bunch of men
like pulling these stones.

01:09:52.890 --> 01:09:55.910
They wanted to see how to
build a miniature pyramid.

01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:59.484
So the camera showed
the men, heave ho heave.

01:09:59.484 --> 01:10:00.900
And so they're
pulling the stones.

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:04.760
So they showed the
men and the ropes.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:07.830
And then, when I went to
Egypt a few months later,

01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:10.200
I'll learned that
what they didn't show

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:13.750
was the tractor that was
really pulling in the stone.

01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:16.190
So this is a joke,
but nevertheless, that

01:10:16.190 --> 01:10:20.810
was because they did find the
evidence of the actual pyramid

01:10:20.810 --> 01:10:21.370
builders.

01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:24.747
Now, as I said,
that argument really

01:10:24.747 --> 01:10:26.080
doesn't have any weight anymore.

01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:28.200
But if you look up
Mark Lehner, you

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:32.610
can actually see
some of their evidece

01:10:32.610 --> 01:10:34.720
because he's the one
that's really over the site

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:38.540
now, Mark Lehner.

01:10:38.540 --> 01:10:42.660
But that really just
helped slay the argument.

01:10:42.660 --> 01:10:43.803
AUDIENCE: A follow up here.

01:10:43.803 --> 01:10:45.860
So there still
were slaves, right?

01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:49.100
So was there [INAUDIBLE]
edition that--

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:51.350
who actually got
a part at the job,

01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:53.360
and then, slaves
had other roles?

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.610
MANU AMPIM: Slaves.

01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:58.240
The slave idea comes
from two sources,

01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:00.866
from the biblical idea
and then some of the later

01:11:00.866 --> 01:11:02.990
Greek writers, who had no
idea how they were built,

01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:04.890
so they made up
a lot of stories.

01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:09.920
So many people think that
there were slaves in the Bible

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:10.950
that built pyramids.

01:11:10.950 --> 01:11:14.060
The problem is the very
first Hebrew was Abraham.

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:19.310
Abraham was dated to
about 1600 or 1650 BCE.

01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:22.840
The problem is that that's 1,000
years after these were built.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:25.570
So how could Abraham
leap through history,

01:11:25.570 --> 01:11:29.890
1,000 years before him,
and build pyramids?

01:11:29.890 --> 01:11:33.060
So there's no evidence
of any slaves whatsoever.

01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:35.080
What you do see
though is that when

01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.240
Egypt-- when other nations
tried to invade Egypt,

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:40.530
you do see captors.

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:42.340
You see prisoners of
war, but you never

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:45.240
see them being employed
into any kind of labor.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.250
So you see that.

01:11:46.250 --> 01:11:47.637
You see bound captives.

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:50.220
And then, the Greeks came around
and made up a lot of stories.

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:53.220
Herodotus is a very good
source for Greek myth

01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:56.500
like, for example, Herodotus
is saying that-- Herodotus

01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:59.010
is a good source
because he reports what

01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:04.010
he saw at the time, at 500 BCE,
and he reports what he heard.

01:12:04.010 --> 01:12:05.827
And so Herodotus relays myths.

01:12:05.827 --> 01:12:08.160
And he said, look, I'm just
going to say what the Greeks

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:08.680
say .

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.840
So according to the
Greek mythology,

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:16.060
Khufu-- those smaller pyramids
were built because Khufu's

01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:20.290
daughter, supposedly, was
involved with prostitution.

01:12:20.290 --> 01:12:22.290
And for every man
that she slept with,

01:12:22.290 --> 01:12:25.570
she asked that
they bring a stone.

01:12:25.570 --> 01:12:26.390
Incredible.

01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:28.379
And that this is how
the monument was built.

01:12:28.379 --> 01:12:30.170
First of all, there is
no evidence of this.

01:12:30.170 --> 01:12:30.740
This is silly.

01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:31.900
This is the king's daughter.

01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:33.210
He has tons of
wealth, so why would

01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:34.450
she need to engage in that.

01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:36.310
But it almost seems
like Herodotus

01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:38.870
is half embarrassed
by reporting this.

01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:40.940
But this is the Greek--
the Greek's made up

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:43.040
stories for things
they didn't understand.

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:44.330
But those are the two sources.

01:12:44.330 --> 01:12:48.610
And, of course, the
Ten Commandments

01:12:48.610 --> 01:12:51.080
and all these other things
have come out over the years.

01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.320
This is what has
presented to the public

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:54.690
that there's slavery.

01:12:54.690 --> 01:12:56.445
But there is no
slavery whatsoever.

01:12:56.445 --> 01:12:57.945
I didn't say that
they were perfect.

01:12:57.945 --> 01:12:59.500
I said there's no slavery.

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:02.870
Because all we do see
is we see captives

01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:05.500
that are bound in warfare.

01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.170
But there's nobody employed.

01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:08.020
There's is no text.

01:13:08.020 --> 01:13:09.380
There's no images of it.

01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:11.240
But the idea of slaves
building the pyramid,

01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:13.600
that's been in the
public mind for awhile.

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:16.320
And then, when the evidence
was found at Nazlet El-Semman

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:19.104
and you had people writing about
slavery, then, they say, uh-oh.

01:13:19.104 --> 01:13:20.020
The evidence is there.

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:21.300
We'd better back up.

01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:24.230
So they backed away
from those claims.

01:13:24.230 --> 01:13:25.740
But a lot of the
specialists were

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:28.610
the ones promoting
the slavery idea.

01:13:28.610 --> 01:13:31.220
So that's where we are.

01:13:31.220 --> 01:13:32.997
And if we had time,
I would really

01:13:32.997 --> 01:13:34.330
show you the evidence from here.

01:13:34.330 --> 01:13:37.460
I didn't include these slides
because it's interesting

01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:42.720
when you actually see the
evidence of the actual workers,

01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:45.550
and the city that they worked
in, and how they were paid.

01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:46.443
You can see it.

01:13:46.443 --> 01:13:48.552
It shows you.

01:13:48.552 --> 01:13:52.286
Any other-- Well, thank
you for your time folks.

01:13:52.286 --> 01:13:53.680
I really appreciative it.

01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:56.080
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.230
I can give you guys--
