00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.049
Congratulations, you made it to the finish line and covered a ton of ground.

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:07.855
In this course, we've learned about focus,

00:00:07.855 --> 00:00:10.375
semantics, ARIA, and styling,

00:00:10.375 --> 00:00:11.699
and how they all fit into wuh-kag,

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:13.254
and web, and checklists.

00:00:13.255 --> 00:00:16.234
These are really important tools in our accessibility tool belt,

00:00:16.234 --> 00:00:19.554
but it can be easy to get caught up in the low level implementation details,

00:00:19.554 --> 00:00:21.969
and forget that accessibility is really all about making

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:24.489
sure all of your users can access your content.

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:29.059
Throughout the course, we met some users with various forms of impairments,

00:00:29.059 --> 00:00:33.384
including the Laura, a program manager on Chrome who has low vision, Attah,

00:00:33.384 --> 00:00:36.429
a software engineer with motor impairment, Josina,

00:00:36.429 --> 00:00:39.924
who is blind and manages a team of test engineers, Sam,

00:00:39.924 --> 00:00:42.242
a recruiter at Google who is also deaf,

00:00:42.243 --> 00:00:43.495
and of course our good friend Victor,

00:00:43.494 --> 00:00:47.799
who is a blind technical program manager working across several product areas.

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:50.695
It's important to remember that no matter what your product is,

00:00:50.695 --> 00:00:53.230
there's a whole range of users out there,

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:56.769
not just the narrow spectrum that we might be designing for.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.130
Building only for that subset of users is excluding

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.199
not only anyone with a permanent disability or impairment,

00:01:03.198 --> 00:01:05.375
but also means our product may fail

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:09.730
any user when they're in a context which impacts the way that they use technology,

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.755
such as trying to use a phone one handed while wrangling a screaming toddler.

00:01:14.754 --> 00:01:19.659
So, having empathy is a huge part of creating an accessible product.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.185
Another really important aspect is to make it part of the process from the beginning,

00:01:23.185 --> 00:01:25.034
and make it part of everyone's job.

00:01:25.034 --> 00:01:26.524
And by that, we mean everyone.

00:01:26.525 --> 00:01:28.870
Developers obviously have a really important role to

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.225
play in making sure that we implement interface

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:35.938
in a way which maximize accessibility and takes advantage of the HDMI platform,

00:01:35.938 --> 00:01:37.989
but designers also have responsibility to

00:01:37.989 --> 00:01:40.584
ensure that accessibility is considered from the beginning,

00:01:40.584 --> 00:01:42.969
both in terms of ensuring that the visual design is

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.450
accessible as Rob laid out in this lesson,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.075
but also considering keyboard usability and semantics and rebuilding,

00:01:49.075 --> 00:01:51.700
and project or product managers have a responsibility to

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.490
ensure that accessibility is a walking criterion for launch,

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:57.519
and to make sure that it's scheduled appropriately.

00:01:57.519 --> 00:01:59.750
Have all of that is a best case scenario.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.969
We know the real world is messy than that.

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.164
So, what can we do to try and make things better right away?

00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:07.795
Remediating accessibility like any time,

00:02:07.795 --> 00:02:10.534
you're trying to reduce the number of bugs in your software.

00:02:10.534 --> 00:02:13.245
It's best looked at through the lens of impact.

00:02:13.245 --> 00:02:17.469
How can you have the most impact on users with the least amount of effort?

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.900
And this boils down to three main things.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.950
First, how frequently is this piece of UI used?

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:26.004
Is it a critical part of the application like the sign in form

00:02:26.004 --> 00:02:29.924
or something that might be a handy feature but less commonly used?

00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:34.385
Second, how badly does this accessibility issue affect our users?

00:02:34.384 --> 00:02:36.250
For example, is it something which is just going to

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.555
stop screen reader users in their tracks?

00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:43.050
Or is it something which maybe is annoying but can be worked around?

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.365
And finally, how expensive is it going to be to fix this issue?

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:49.480
Could we fix three other critical accessibility bugs

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:52.689
in the time it takes to fix this one?

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:54.069
In the end, the only true measure of

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.859
accessibility is whether users can use that products,

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.660
well designed and built product again to make for

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:02.234
a very broad range of uses in a very broad range of situations.

00:03:02.235 --> 00:03:05.305
So, ultimately, good accessibility equals good UX,

00:03:05.305 --> 00:03:09.000
and making it a part of your process is going to benefit everyone.
