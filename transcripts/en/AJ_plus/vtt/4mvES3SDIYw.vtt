00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:08.840
In 2016, a fierce, Indigenous-led movement emerged at Standing Rock. The world

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.040
watched while a powerful oil company and police teamed up to unleash violence on

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.300
protesters. Ultimately, the pipeline
company won. Now, Energy Transfer Partners

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.119
is extending that pipeline to Louisiana.
And another resistance is brewing. This

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.800
time, it's out in the swamps of Cajun
country, across Indigenous lands and

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.340
waterways, and in communities of color.
Waging war on Big Oil isn't easy, but

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.960
people here are not going down without a fight.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.980
Oil and gas is king in Louisiana.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.500
We are gonna fight every inch of this pipeline going into the ground in whatever way we can.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.980
They're profiting off of our pain.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.120
My fight is clean water, clean soil and clean air.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.120
Activists here call the pipeline the “black snake.”

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.800
We call it kicking the snake in its a**.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.120
We're driving across Louisiana to talk to the people affected and

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.500
see what they're doing to resist. Our
first stop: Indian Bayou.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.180
This is the land of refugees and survivors and thrivers.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.220
I’m with Cherri Foytlin, who runs the L'eau Est La Vie (louie la vie) protest camp,

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.640
which means “Water Is Life.” They travel to different locations to disrupt pipeline construction.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.780
We're resisting one of the largest Goliath-type beasts in the world, which

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.570
is the oil and gas industry. It didn't
start at Standing Rock that people were

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.869
fighting, especially Indigenous people.
Indigenous mothers and grandmothers have

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.259
been fighting for ourselves and for this
land, and for the water and the safety of

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.789
the people who live here, for generations
upon generations upon generations. Energy

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:54.420
Transfer Partners has spilled every 11
days on average for the past 15 years.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.800
The camp bought an 11-acre piece of land in the pipeline's path, which serves as

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.420
its headquarters. The pipeline company
was forced to change its plans and reroute

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.160
around the camp because of the holdout. Protesters have had run-ins with police and pipeline security.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.300
The intimidation has been pretty intense at times. There is some sort of shadowy group that's around, that's in

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.080
very dark, tinted cars.
I'll be in Piggly-Wiggly and they'll be taking

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.300
pictures of me and my kids, you know, shopping for food. Or they'll be outside my house or whatever.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.800
[Police] stop us for a traffic ticket with their guns drawn it's almost like they want to see something happen.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.380
Just being at camp is pretty difficult. It’s 98 degrees right now and oppressively humid.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.120
It's the mosquitoes you got to worry about, because they will eat you up.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.350
Since colonization happened, Indigenous
peoples here in Louisiana, what's now

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.819
called Louisiana, were pushed back
further and further into the swamps, and

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.090
not only did they find a way to thrive there,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.310
they also found a way to resist there. It is a gorgeous place worth protecting, and

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.190
there's so much more to protect. I
worry about the idea that it's

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.780
all gone, that it's all refineries and chemical plants.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.080
Our next stop is out in Cajun Country, where a huge point of contention is the pipeline running

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.019
through the Atchafalaya Basin, the
biggest wetlands area in the United

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:25.230
States. Many Cajun people, like Jody Meche, depend on it to make a living. He's suing the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:33.000
Army Corps of Engineers for allowing ETP to come into the basin, given the damage past pipelines have done.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.180
These people make billions and billions of

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.870
dollars, and there's no reason why they
should destroy such a sensitive

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.269
ecosystem and a sensitive world we live in. You know what I'm saying? I'm telling y'all,

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:53.320
when I get a trap full of dead crawfish, that ain't no good. It's an indication of like the canary in the mine shaft.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.860
Jody has been fishing here all his life.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.480
It was a trade that was passed down by
his father and his grandfather before that.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.220
That’s what it’s all about. There's too much at stake.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.700
There's people's livelihoods at
stake, there's numerous species of fish

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.689
and birds, I mean, all types of marine
animals that survive out here. The Cajun

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:19.520
people and the Cajun way of life, we were
born and we followed our parents and

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.050
watched them do their living, by fishing
and making their way of life in the

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:30.320
Atchafalaya Basin, you know, catching fish, crawfish, hunting stuff to eat. And you

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.520
adapt to that way of life. You're born into that.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.980
A judge put a temporary halt on pipeline construction due to Jody's case. The ruling was appealed and

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.020
now construction is back on.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.940
This is the newly cleared right-of-way for the Bayou Bridge pipeline.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:55.300
I'm worried about the risk of a 20-inch oil pipeline potentially obstructing – and leaking.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.919
Should that oil leak to a capacity that it spreads across these thousands of acres

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.420
of critical habitat, I mean, you definitely have a major disaster.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.780
Oil companies have changed the Atchafalaya Basin

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:14.160
already. They clear large areas of trees,
and bore down into the swamp bottom.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.700
The excess dirt dams up certain areas and creates pockets of dead swamp where nothing can survive.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.280
There's creatures that are relying on

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.210
this water. It should have been better
taken care of than what it was. And I

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.710
want to make sure that it's done better
in the future so we don't continue to

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.120
lose areas like what we've lost. And none
of those creatures can give

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.340
interviews or can go to
legislatures and cry out to the

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.460
people who are supposed to be doing the
job to represent the environment and

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.840
represent the people and represent them.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.040
Another issue, which is all too real in

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:54.620
Louisiana: flooding. Dredging has caused
sediment buildup, and the basin now has

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.280
less capacity to hold floodwaters.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.640
The water, as it comes into the basin, it has

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.040
to go higher up on the levee systems,
putting our levee systems, which

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.150
are not up to par, at greater risk of
breaching or topping and flooding

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.290
millions of people in countless
communities. We're not opposed to the oil and

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:16.130
gas industry, we're not opposed to your
jobs, your jobs being

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:22.100
related to the oil and gas industry. We just
know the job can be done better.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.960
75 miles east, there's another waterway that could be seriously damaged.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:32.180
We're meeting with Monique Verdin, a
tribal councilman for the Houma Nation.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.220
This water body behind me, the Bayou Lafourche, provides over 300,000 people

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.330
south of here with their drinking water,
their bathing water, their everything

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:46.940
water. This really is the lifeline for
the United Houma Nation.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:53.260
The Houma dodged the Trail of Tears by going deep into the delta, to the ends of the bayous,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.260
where they had everything they needed because they were able to provide for themselves.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.950
If the pipeline were to burst, or if there was

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:06.920
to be an accident, that's not only the
water for the Bayou Lafourche, that's the

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.920
water for everybody in New Orleans.
That's the water for everybody south of New Orleans.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.380
Monique is part of a coalition of

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.430
Indigenous women who focus on divestment,
so they urge big banks to stop funding

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.580
companies that build pipelines on sacred land.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.540
When you look at this legacy of

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:30.260
colonialism here and then you follow the
pipeline money, it leads back to Europe,

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:34.400
to these big banks that are investing in
these corporations.

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:43.440
At the endpoint of the pipeline, our final stop is the town of St. James, where residents are pushing back.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:50.240
Harry Joseph, who pastors a tiny Baptist
church, is, like Jody, suing the pipeline company.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.980
The Bayou Bridge pipeline, you saw how they twisted and how they turned it.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:08:00.300
Till they got to St. James, through a lot of black areas, through a lot of Hispanic areas, a lot of Indians.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.580
They ain't went through none of the white folks' area.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:10.280
For years, oil and gas companies have run rampant on this low-income black community. People live with huge

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:15.120
fuel tanks in their backyards. Refineries and pipelines are everywhere.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.620
They need to move up the road somewhere, and let people there store their oil,

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.720
because it ain't going to get here. I'll make sure of that. We got enough tanks in now. We got 118

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.960
tanks. That's enough.
But with the Bayou Bridge pipeline, that

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:30.250
mean more tanks. That mean more oil is going to be stored here. That mean more

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.240
leaks going to be here. That mean that more smell's going to be here. You know,

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.320
we got oil leaking now and nobody want to take the responsibility.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.400
St. James is in the heart of Cancer Alley, a stretch of Louisiana with

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.660
some of the highest rates of cancer rates in the country.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:49.300
Eventually, if you stay here, you going to die. My church is a family. I

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.560
don't look at my members as my members, I look at them as my family, because we

00:08:53.560 --> 00:09:00.260
are very close. And one of my members is
sickly. She got cancer. So that's why I'm

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:07.140
involved, because when my people hurt, I
hurt. When my people suffer, I suffer.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:11.800
Previous pipeline companies have closed off a road that served as an evacuation route

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.970
for a part of the community.
People worry if there was leak or

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.420
explosion, they would have no way out.

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.360
This is not a want. This is a need. We need

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:26.860
an evacuation route. I'm going to fight, I'm gonna do whatever I got to do. But I don't

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:32.500
think we can overcome, because once you let one in, and you let another one in,

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:39.300
and you let another one in, and you let a Bayou Bridge pipeline in, you done let too much come in already.

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:42.000
Louisiana already has over 50,000

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:46.870
miles of pipelines, and they're second
only to Texas in refineries. While the

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.410
industry props up their economy, they
also have the most to lose to the

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:54.720
effects of climate change, which is
caused by these fossil fuel industries.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.150
We lose a football field of land
every 45 minutes in south Louisiana. And

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.960
any land that goes into water becomes
property of the state, and the state

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.520
leases it back to the oil and gas industry.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:12.160
One third of the nation's oil and gas is either being produced or transported via south Louisiana. But I

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.680
always like to remind people that we're
the best-worst example. When it comes to

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.820
poverty in America, we're at the top of
the list. When it comes to quality

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.720
education and healthcare, we're at the
bottom of the list.

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:32.940
Louisiana has powered all of the United States – to great sacrifice of ourselves. We, at

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:37.270
this point, are like a stage-four lung
cancer patient that's continuing to

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:41.940
smoke. You know, it's time to make that
change so that we are actually able to survive.
