00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.600
[music playing]

00:00:02.734 --> 00:00:04.800
Sometimes nature
plays tricks on us.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.533
What we think we know
to be true may not be.

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.367
Animals, for example,
have lots of secrets,

00:00:10.367 --> 00:00:11.934
like their remarkable
use of color

00:00:11.934 --> 00:00:16.300
to attract mates or disguise
themselves from predators.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.367
Well, it turns out
they've been using

00:00:18.367 --> 00:00:22.600
colors in ways that have been
tricking us humans as well.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.300
We reached out to the Explorer
and [inaudible] communities

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.200
to crowdsource this special
Explorer segment, True Blue.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.433
[music playing]

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:38.734
NARRATOR: White, black,
red, green, yellow.

00:00:38.734 --> 00:00:41.133
Animals have evolved to
come into every color

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.266
of the rainbow.

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:44.200
But with few exceptions.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.734
Animals are not blue.

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:50.900
For animals most color
comes from pigments,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.567
color chemicals that are
produced by special cells.

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:57.867
Pink, orange,
chartreuse, animals

00:00:57.867 --> 00:01:00.500
can produce many different
types of color pigment,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.700
but blue is a problem.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.133
NARRATOR: Some
animals appear blue,

00:01:05.133 --> 00:01:07.500
but they're deceiving you.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.967
SARAH GARRET: Instead
of using pigments,

00:01:08.967 --> 00:01:11.734
most blue animals have developed
a way to trick your eyes

00:01:11.734 --> 00:01:14.700
and play with light,
using physical structures

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.033
to appear blue.

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:19.200
Most of the blues you think
you know really aren't blue.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.667
[music playing]

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:22.066
NARRATOR: Humans can only
see light in what we call

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:25.133
the visible spectrum,
a narrow band

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:27.433
of electromagnetic wavelengths.

00:01:27.433 --> 00:01:29.734
Color is how we perceive
different wavelengths

00:01:29.734 --> 00:01:31.400
of light in that spectrum.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.200
And that visible spectrum
contains all the colors

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.567
that we see in this world.

00:01:36.567 --> 00:01:39.200
SARAH GARRET: This is the
blue morpho butterfly.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.300
Yes, the emoji one.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.333
It is the perfect example of
an animal that only appears

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:46.800
blue because of the
clever way that its wing

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.000
scales interact with light.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.166
Similar to how a prism disperses
different wavelengths of light,

00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:56.467
a blue morpho wing has
microscopic structures

00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:59.367
that scatter light to
cancel out other colors,

00:01:59.367 --> 00:02:01.433
reflecting only blue.

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:04.033
This is based on how
the light reflects.

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:05.967
As you change your
viewing angle,

00:02:05.967 --> 00:02:07.700
different colors
appear stronger,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.133
giving us an
incredible iridescent

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:13.900
effect, the tell tale
sign of a fake blue.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.433
And because that reflection
is based on the structure

00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:19.233
of the wing, if you filled
that structure with something

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:24.000
different, say, alcohol,
that color would change.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.900
Don't worry.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.867
It dries back to blue.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.166
Many other animals use
physics to deceive us.

00:02:32.166 --> 00:02:35.433
For example, there are no
blue feathers on birds.

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:38.400
All birds that appear
blue have some structure

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.066
in their feathers that
reflects only blue light.

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:44.900
And almost all fish
use light scattering

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.767
to create their vibrant blues.

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:52.233
Less than 1% of the animals
that you perceive as blue

00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:54.266
actually have any
blue pigment in them.

00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:57.967
That 1% with blue are very rare.

00:02:57.967 --> 00:02:59.834
They are true blues.

00:02:59.834 --> 00:03:01.734
[music playing]

00:03:01.734 --> 00:03:04.600
NARRATOR: This is the
olivewing butterfly.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.200
It's one of very few insect
species on Earth known

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.934
to have a true blue pigment.

00:03:10.934 --> 00:03:13.066
This is the blue
poison dart frog,

00:03:13.066 --> 00:03:17.100
one of the only vertebrates
known to contain blue pigment.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.266
No matter how you look
at them, they're blue.

00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:24.800
All of the other animals
only appear blue.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.934
You may perceive blue, but it's
because these animals have all

00:03:27.934 --> 00:03:30.166
evolved a way to
trick your eyes,

00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:33.767
using the physics of light
to control what you see.

00:03:33.767 --> 00:03:35.300
But why blue?

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.200
Maybe it's to let predators
know that you're poisonous.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.367
Maybe it's to impress a mate.

00:03:40.367 --> 00:03:43.433
Maybe it's because blue
pigment is so rare,

00:03:43.433 --> 00:03:46.367
and evolving a way to fake blue
simply allows certain animals

00:03:46.367 --> 00:03:48.066
to stand out from the crowd.

00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:51.433
We don't yet know
why blue is so rare.

00:03:51.433 --> 00:03:55.233
But the rarity of blue is
not just limited to animals.

00:03:55.233 --> 00:03:58.166
Blue pigments are uncommon
everywhere in nature.

00:03:58.166 --> 00:04:00.300
There are no blue foods.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.600
Less than 10% of
flowers are blue.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.500
And the two things
that most of us

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.934
think of as quintessentially
blue, the sky and the sea, also

00:04:08.934 --> 00:04:14.233
only appear blue because of the
physics of light scattering.

00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:15.600
NARRATOR: They say you
have to see something

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.700
with your own eyes
to believe it.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.100
But nature shows that your
eyes are easily deceived.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.934
We may not know why
blue is so rare,

00:04:23.934 --> 00:04:27.734
but now we have to wonder, if
you can't trust your own eyes,

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:29.800
what can you trust?
