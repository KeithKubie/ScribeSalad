00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.252
(children talking)

00:00:13.252 --> 00:00:14.623
- What were you all discussing?

00:00:14.623 --> 00:00:15.560
- Nothing.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.840
- [Whitney Holland] I've seen 
a lot of my kids this year,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.350
instead of just exploding,
getting really upset

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.120
they are aware of their emotions

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.150
and before lashing out they will be like,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.180
"Okay, I need to go to the peace corner."

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.290
- [Mathew Portell] At Fall Hamilton 
we have students

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.870
who are currently experiencing

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.080
some serious tragedy in their lives.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.020
When they walk through the door they don't

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.750
leave everything at the door,
they bring it with them.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.930
- Do you need to take a break?

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.763
Yeah?

00:00:45.763 --> 00:00:47.120
- [Mathew] We're trying
to build the capacity

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.920
for them to be able to know what to do

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.520
when they're frustrated
or when they're angry.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.310
So we're using peace corners.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.400
- [Madisien Steele] There is a 
peace corner in every classroom.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.840
That is a place that a student
can go if they need a break.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.690
If they just need a time out,
they're having a hard time.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.040
There's gonna be some comfy
pillows or a bean bag.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.340
There'll be some fidgets.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.830
Different things to help
de-escalate the student.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.030
- [Abby] If I get really frustrated 
and feel like

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.000
I'm gonna yell or get mad at somebody,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.040
I go to the peace corner
and just calm down.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.270
- [Whitney] We set a five-minute 
timer so they

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.090
know that they have five
minutes to cool down.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.080
If it's really bad and
they need some extra time

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.580
I said they can flip it
again and take their time.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.500
- [Abby] My teacher has this
sheet that you fill out.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.860
It tells you how you feel,
what choice you made,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.930
and what should you do to
make it better next time.

00:01:50.134 --> 00:01:52.330
- [Madisien] There's also gonna be
some charts that talk about

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.300
breathing or counting or
different things a student

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.810
can do to de-escalate in the moment.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.430
At the end of that time it's time to

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.530
reintegrate with the rest of the students.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.950
- [Mathew] Every kid uses it so
it's not a place of stigma.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.620
It's a place that we allow students

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.460
to utilize the strategies
that we're teaching them.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.750
- Ready to go?

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.060
- [Whitney] We've seen a huge shift 
in behavior.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.320
There's not as many outbursts,

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.610
there's not as many arguments

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.990
'cause they've realized their emotions,

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.990
they're understanding
them, and they're able to

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.424
make that decision to go sit
down at the peace corner.

00:02:25.424 --> 00:02:28.341
