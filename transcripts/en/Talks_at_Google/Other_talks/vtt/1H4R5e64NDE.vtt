FEMALE SPEAKER: I'd like
to introduce Mikaila Ulmer.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.460
She is our 10-year-old
entrepreneur.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.980
And Mikaila is going to start
off today with a presentation.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.790
And then she'll show us a couple
of videos that she's done.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.731
And then we'll go
into a Q&amp;A. And I just

00:00:18.731 --> 00:00:20.230
want to start by
saying that I think

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.110
Mikaila's a fantastic
example that you're never

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.490
too young, like Mikaila,
or too old to come up

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.320
with a great idea
and take a risk

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.430
and be daring and do something
that you've always dreamed to.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.565
So with that, I'll let
Mikaila take it away.

00:00:33.565 --> 00:00:34.606
MIKAILA ULMER: Thank you.

00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:41.485
So again, my name
is Mikaila Ulmer.

00:00:41.485 --> 00:00:43.414
And thank you for inviting me.

00:00:43.414 --> 00:00:44.455
And thank you for coming.

00:00:44.455 --> 00:00:46.930
Again, I'm 10 years old,
and I'm in the fifth grade.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.395
I'm from Austin, Texas and
I am the founder and CEO

00:00:50.395 --> 00:00:52.870
of Bee Sweet Lemonade.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.820
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.702
I'm also a bee
ambassador, student

00:00:59.702 --> 00:01:03.478
and social entrepreneur.

00:01:03.478 --> 00:01:10.116
So today, I'm going to tell you
a little bit about my business

00:01:10.116 --> 00:01:12.440
and some really interesting
facts about the bees.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.633
And then I'm going to
show you some lessons

00:01:14.633 --> 00:01:16.424
that I've learned on
being an entrepreneur.

00:01:16.424 --> 00:01:22.705
But first, let's start
with a couple of bee jokes.

00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:24.478
What did the bee
say to the sushi?

00:01:24.478 --> 00:01:29.458
Or what did the
sushi say to the bee?

00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:30.952
Take three guesses.

00:01:30.952 --> 00:01:32.942
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:32.942 --> 00:01:33.442
Yes!

00:01:33.442 --> 00:01:35.434
You got it right.

00:01:35.434 --> 00:01:43.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.906
Where do bees shop?

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.533
AUDIENCE: Where do bees shop--

00:01:48.533 --> 00:01:49.366
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:02:02.158 --> 00:02:03.142
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:02:03.142 --> 00:02:04.618
Where?

00:02:04.618 --> 00:02:06.586
MIKAILA ULMER: Bee [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:06.586 --> 00:02:09.538
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:13.474
So Bee Sweet Lemonade is
lemonade sweetened with honey.

00:02:13.474 --> 00:02:14.458
And it has flax seed.

00:02:14.458 --> 00:02:17.340
And it's currently
bottled in glass.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.800
We currently have four
flavors, mint, prickly pear,

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.330
half and half tea
lemonade and ginger.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.155
Right now, something
really big is

00:02:25.155 --> 00:02:27.310
that Whole Foods
carries our product

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.729
throughout the southwest
region of the United States.

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:34.986
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:02:34.986 --> 00:02:38.080
And we went from selling it
out of our lemonade stand

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.992
in a very small business
to actually selling it

00:02:41.992 --> 00:02:45.712
through Whole Foods throughout
the southwest region.

00:02:45.712 --> 00:02:48.936
And I started Bee Sweet
Lemonade when I signed up

00:02:48.936 --> 00:02:52.160
in two kids entrepreneurial
events, Acton Children's

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.136
Business Fair and
Austin Lemonade Day.

00:02:55.136 --> 00:02:58.608
And so I signed up in those two
events, and I needed a product.

00:02:58.608 --> 00:03:01.088
So while I was trying to
come up with a product,

00:03:01.088 --> 00:03:02.080
two things happened.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.064
I got stung by two
bees in one week,

00:03:04.064 --> 00:03:06.544
and my great granny,
Helen, sent me

00:03:06.544 --> 00:03:10.512
a 1940 cookbook with her
favorite recipe of flax seed

00:03:10.512 --> 00:03:11.070
lemonade.

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.398
I was very, very
scared of the bees.

00:03:14.398 --> 00:03:18.878
And I would overreact and freak
out when they came anywhere

00:03:18.878 --> 00:03:19.378
near me.

00:03:19.378 --> 00:03:23.060
So my parents wanted me to just
do some research on the bees

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.610
to see if would be a little
bit less scared of them

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.530
And I did that research
and I found out

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.620
how incredibly important
pollinators they are

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.273
and how they're dying.

00:03:33.273 --> 00:03:36.460
So I decided to create a product
that helped save the bees,

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.410
and used my great granny
Helen's recipe as well.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.270
And that's how Bee
Sweet was born.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:47.100
Now, I save the bees because
bees pollinate a third out

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.635
of all the food we eat.

00:03:48.635 --> 00:03:52.435
And they also contribute
over $14 billion

00:03:52.435 --> 00:03:56.155
to the US agricultural
economy a year.

00:03:56.155 --> 00:03:58.510
So that's a lot of
money, if you realize

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.996
how special the bees are.

00:04:01.996 --> 00:04:05.910
And I also try to save
them because they're

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.510
dying of chemical pesticides.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.751
And here's some ways that
we can help save them.

00:04:12.751 --> 00:04:14.579
So you can support
your local beekeepers

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.410
by buying local honey.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.413
Or you could visit
local beehives

00:04:18.413 --> 00:04:20.818
and learn a little bit
more about the bees.

00:04:20.818 --> 00:04:24.235
You can plant flowers in
different colors, shapes

00:04:24.235 --> 00:04:27.976
or sizes to give the
bees something to eat.

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.456
You can avoid using pesticides.

00:04:30.456 --> 00:04:33.432
And chemical pesticides
harm the bees,

00:04:33.432 --> 00:04:36.904
so you can use natural
and organic pesticides.

00:04:36.904 --> 00:04:41.570
Or even ladybugs and praying
mantises will keep pests away.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.420
So try to avoid pesticides
because they harm the bees.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:47.420
And then share the buzz.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.880
If you find anything
about the bees,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.848
you can share it
with your friends

00:04:51.848 --> 00:04:54.308
and tell your friends to
share it with their friends.

00:04:54.308 --> 00:04:55.784
And so we can
spread the awareness

00:04:55.784 --> 00:04:58.367
that the bees are dying
and make more of an impact

00:04:58.367 --> 00:04:59.720
on saving the bees.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.648
So I've been an
entrepreneur for five years.

00:05:03.648 --> 00:05:04.148
And so--

00:05:04.148 --> 00:05:06.116
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:06.116 --> 00:05:11.036
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:11.036 --> 00:05:14.250
Here are some lessons that
I've learned while being

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.888
an entrepreneur for five years.

00:05:15.888 --> 00:05:21.041
And so the first lesson
is, working hard is a must.

00:05:21.041 --> 00:05:23.300
In order to start
and grow my business,

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.290
I had to work very hard.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.258
In other words, as
people like to say,

00:05:27.258 --> 00:05:29.226
I had to wear a lot of hats.

00:05:29.226 --> 00:05:32.340
I had to wear a marketing
hat, finance hat.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.407
I did workshops, teaching
families on the bees.

00:05:35.407 --> 00:05:36.740
And I still had to be a student.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:39.324
So yes, in order to
even start a business,

00:05:39.324 --> 00:05:41.710
you have to work hard.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.680
Lesson two is, you need
passion and a lot of it.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.310
As I mentioned
earlier, one thing

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.360
that helped me start Bee
Sweet Lemonade was that I got

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.574
stung by two bees in one week.

00:05:53.574 --> 00:05:56.410
And again, I was very
afraid of the bees,

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:59.550
and so my parents wanted
me to do some research.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.702
And doing that
research, again, I

00:06:02.702 --> 00:06:06.490
found out how incredibly
important pollinators they are.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.231
And I developed a passion
for saving the bees,

00:06:10.231 --> 00:06:12.480
learning about the bees, and
just the bees in general.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.360
And so with that
passion, I think

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.760
that passion helped
me create my business,

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.080
a growing, successful
and thriving business.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.380
And here's a little [INAUDIBLE]
that I made up on passion.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.720
You need passion and a lot of
it, because the more passionate

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.913
you are about what you
do, the more fun you

00:06:34.913 --> 00:06:36.118
have while doing it.

00:06:36.118 --> 00:06:39.410
And so, with that quote,
that reminds me how important

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:40.741
passion is to my business.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:49.250
Lesson three is inspiration
comes from many places.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.166
As I mentioned earlier,
another thing that helped

00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:55.850
start Bee Sweet Lemonade was
that my great granny Helen sent

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:59.498
me a 1940s cookbook with her
favorite recipe of flax seed

00:06:59.498 --> 00:06:59.998
lemonade.

00:06:59.998 --> 00:07:03.902
And we didn't know that
that-- well, of course,

00:07:03.902 --> 00:07:05.366
we thought it was
special, but we

00:07:05.366 --> 00:07:09.758
didn't know that that cookbook
would help start a business.

00:07:09.758 --> 00:07:12.220
We didn't know it would be
an inspiration or anything,

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.044
but actually, that cookbook
was the inspiration

00:07:16.044 --> 00:07:17.502
behind the product I chose.

00:07:17.502 --> 00:07:21.105
And we became inspired by,
one, just how the flax seed

00:07:21.105 --> 00:07:24.830
lemonade was made, and it
was such a special way,

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.681
and two, how they had and
utilized flax seed back

00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:31.650
in those days, and three,
just the recipe, how

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.104
it was old and special and
passed on from our family.

00:07:36.104 --> 00:07:39.970
So I just think that
inspiration helped

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.190
create my business, a growing,
successful and thriving

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.946
business.

00:07:44.946 --> 00:07:47.480
And the last
lesson, lesson four,

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.610
is you can be sweet and
still be profitable.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:51.606
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:51.606 --> 00:07:57.993
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:57.993 --> 00:07:59.076
I'm a social entrepreneur.

00:07:59.076 --> 00:08:02.064
My business is focused
on giving back.

00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:07.542
And I donate my time and
money to saving the bees.

00:08:07.542 --> 00:08:09.907
And Bee Sweet
Lemonade is very proud

00:08:09.907 --> 00:08:13.020
to say that we are making a
measurable impact on saving

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:16.506
the bees, and we're
profitable at the same time.

00:08:16.506 --> 00:08:19.494
So with that, I want
everybody to conclude

00:08:19.494 --> 00:08:22.978
that we don't have to choose
between being sweet and being

00:08:22.978 --> 00:08:23.478
profitable.

00:08:23.478 --> 00:08:24.144
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:08:24.144 --> 00:08:28.956
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:28.956 --> 00:08:30.948
MIKAILA ULMER: Again,
thank you for coming,

00:08:30.948 --> 00:08:32.940
and thank you for inviting me.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:36.308
If you'd like to learn more
about my business or my mission

00:08:36.308 --> 00:08:38.992
to save the bees, you

00:08:43.628 --> 00:08:45.580
YouTube.

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.990
So that, and I think we're
going to do videos now.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.560
Thank you.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.110
[APPLAUSE]
