00:00:00.509 --> 00:00:01.824
- [Voiceover] We have other videos that go

00:00:01.824 --> 00:00:03.796
into some depth on the Calvin cycle,

00:00:03.796 --> 00:00:05.490
and we'll refer to that in this video

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.406
as the normal Calvin cycle,

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:09.681
and the focus of this
video is really a quirk

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:12.296
that diverts us from
the normal Calvin cycle,

00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:15.149
and it's a quirk due to
this enzyme right here

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:18.077
whose shorthand name is rubisco.

00:00:18.077 --> 00:00:20.176
So to get an appreciation for that quirk,

00:00:20.176 --> 00:00:22.414
let's first do a very quick overview

00:00:22.414 --> 00:00:24.709
of a normal Calvin cycle.

00:00:24.709 --> 00:00:26.229
So we can start at any point,

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:27.866
but I'll start at the
point that is typically

00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:28.983
started at,

00:00:28.983 --> 00:00:32.983
and we can start with
this five carbon molecule.

00:00:34.394 --> 00:00:37.464
And we're visualizing just the
carbons here for simplicity.

00:00:37.464 --> 00:00:40.784
So each of these grey
circles represent a carbon.

00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:43.450
There's other atoms a
part of this molecule,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.869
but we're not drawing them,

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:46.918
and that's because the
carbon accounting is

00:00:46.918 --> 00:00:48.739
what is interesting in--

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.340
Well, not only the Calvin cycle,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.651
but also this variation, this diversion

00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:54.484
that we're going to see,

00:00:54.484 --> 00:00:57.140
that we're gonna call photo-respiration.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.658
So, right over here, I've set it up so

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:02.879
that I have six molecules of this.

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.907
We call this ribulose
one, five, bisphosphate,

00:01:06.907 --> 00:01:08.876
but because it's a mouthful,

00:01:08.876 --> 00:01:11.648
the shorthand notation is R-U-B-P.

00:01:11.648 --> 00:01:14.220
Sometimes people might say Roo-B-P,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.575
or I guess you could
even say Rube-P somehow,

00:01:17.575 --> 00:01:20.825
but each of these six Rube-P, or RuBPs,

00:01:22.246 --> 00:01:24.977
can then react with a carbon dioxide.

00:01:24.977 --> 00:01:26.894
So if I have six RuBPs,

00:01:28.443 --> 00:01:31.587
well, they're gonna react
with six carbon dioxides,

00:01:31.587 --> 00:01:33.215
and so one way to think about it is,

00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:36.957
it's fixing the carbon
in that carbon dioxide.

00:01:36.957 --> 00:01:38.524
It's taking this carbon that's part

00:01:38.524 --> 00:01:41.506
of this gaseous carbon dioxide,

00:01:41.506 --> 00:01:44.437
and fixing it as part
of an organic molecule.

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:45.891
Now, you might be tempted to say,

00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:50.247
well, it's gonna create
six carbon molecules,

00:01:50.247 --> 00:01:52.251
but then those will immediately become

00:01:52.251 --> 00:01:54.833
12 three carbon molecules.

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:56.656
And notice, and it's
important to keep doing this.

00:01:56.656 --> 00:01:58.277
Pause the video if you need to.

00:01:58.277 --> 00:02:01.282
You can make sure that the
carbons are all accounted for.

00:02:01.282 --> 00:02:03.041
Right over here, how
many carbons do we have?

00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:04.507
Well, we have six times five,

00:02:04.507 --> 00:02:06.545
so that's 30 carbons right over here,

00:02:06.545 --> 00:02:08.600
and here we have six times one carbon,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.685
so that's six carbons right over here.

00:02:10.685 --> 00:02:12.890
So if we wanna account
for all of our carbons,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.945
we should have 36 carbons right over here,

00:02:14.945 --> 00:02:15.778
and we do.

00:02:15.778 --> 00:02:18.093
We have 12 three carbon molecules.

00:02:18.093 --> 00:02:19.450
This three carbon molecules,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.574
when we go into some detail here

00:02:22.574 --> 00:02:24.102
in the video on the Calvin cycle,

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:27.069
it's called three phosphoglycerate,

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.678
but that's not what the
focus is on this video.

00:02:29.678 --> 00:02:32.138
The focus of this video is the enzyme

00:02:32.138 --> 00:02:34.607
that actually does the fixing

00:02:34.607 --> 00:02:37.440
of the carbon along with the RuBP.

00:02:38.906 --> 00:02:40.581
And that enzyme, that character,

00:02:40.581 --> 00:02:42.313
the character with the
quirks that we're going

00:02:42.313 --> 00:02:44.240
to talk about, the shorthand, its name,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.959
you could call it ribulose
one, five, bisphosphate

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.429
oxygenase-carboxylase,

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:53.289
but that's even more of
a mouthful than RuBP,

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:56.503
so people call it the nice
friendly name rubisco,

00:02:56.503 --> 00:02:58.003
rubisco for short.

00:02:59.017 --> 00:03:01.999
But you can learn a lot
about what rubisco does

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:03.602
from its name right over here,

00:03:03.602 --> 00:03:05.593
and you can even learn a
little bit about its quirk

00:03:05.593 --> 00:03:07.272
that we're about to talk about.

00:03:07.272 --> 00:03:12.122
So it obviously involves
ribulose one, five bisphosphate,

00:03:12.122 --> 00:03:14.858
and it does indeed involve that,

00:03:14.858 --> 00:03:19.072
and then you see oxygenase,
dash, carboxylase.

00:03:19.072 --> 00:03:22.012
Well, the carboxylase is what tells us

00:03:22.012 --> 00:03:26.179
that it can deal with the
carbon dioxide right over here.

00:03:27.158 --> 00:03:29.857
The carbon dioxide can
be one of the substrates

00:03:29.857 --> 00:03:34.024
in a reaction with the ribulose
one, five, bisphosphate.

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:37.963
And so that's exactly what
it's doing in this reaction.

00:03:37.963 --> 00:03:39.815
In a normal Calvin cycle,

00:03:39.815 --> 00:03:42.905
it's acting as a carboxylase.

00:03:42.905 --> 00:03:44.382
It is fixing that carbon.

00:03:44.382 --> 00:03:46.396
It's making it part of,

00:03:46.396 --> 00:03:48.452
if you view, you know,
if you view that carbon--

00:03:48.452 --> 00:03:49.395
Actually, I won't do it that way

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:51.599
because here we have 12 as many.

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.371
But it's taking these carbon molecules,

00:03:53.371 --> 00:03:56.338
and it's fixing them
into organic molecules,

00:03:56.338 --> 00:03:58.386
some of which can eventually be used

00:03:58.386 --> 00:04:00.009
to create glucose.

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:02.338
And that's what happens
in a typical Calvin cycle.

00:04:02.338 --> 00:04:05.000
We use up some NadPhs.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.756
We use up some ATPs,

00:04:06.756 --> 00:04:08.054
and we go down.

00:04:08.054 --> 00:04:10.508
Through this cycle, eventually,

00:04:10.508 --> 00:04:13.425
we create some G3Ps, which are also

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.227
three carbon molecules.

00:04:16.227 --> 00:04:20.698
G3P is short for
glyceraldehyde three phosphate,

00:04:20.698 --> 00:04:22.413
for those of you who are interested,

00:04:22.413 --> 00:04:26.653
and then, if we use this
accounting of those 12,

00:04:26.653 --> 00:04:29.313
10 go back through the Calvin cycle

00:04:29.313 --> 00:04:33.879
to regenerate our ribulose
one, five, bisphosphate,

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:36.695
and two of them exit the Calvin cycle,

00:04:36.695 --> 00:04:38.460
and then can be used to produce

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.377
one six carbon glucose.

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:42.919
And so that's what happens

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.557
when everything is fine and dandy.

00:04:44.557 --> 00:04:46.601
That's what the Calvin cycle's purpose is,

00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:48.815
is to be able to have a store of energy

00:04:48.815 --> 00:04:50.898
in the form of a glucose.

00:04:51.826 --> 00:04:54.313
Now, you might have
already gotten a little bit

00:04:54.313 --> 00:04:57.479
of the foreshadowing from rubisco's name.

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.526
Well, maybe it sometimes
acts as an oxygenase.

00:05:01.526 --> 00:05:03.236
So instead of fixing carbon,

00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:05.788
maybe sometimes it fixes oxygen,

00:05:05.788 --> 00:05:08.406
and that is indeed the
quirk that I'm talking

00:05:08.406 --> 00:05:10.589
about of rubisco.

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:12.550
So in photo-respiration,

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.544
instead of fixing carbon,

00:05:14.544 --> 00:05:17.794
it fixes oxygen along with the ribulose

00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:21.498
one, five, bisphosphate.

00:05:21.498 --> 00:05:23.775
And you might say, "Why does it do that?"

00:05:23.775 --> 00:05:26.426
And the answer is, well,
that's a really good question.

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:28.431
Some folks think, well,
that's just one of these

00:05:28.431 --> 00:05:30.694
inefficiencies of a biological process.

00:05:30.694 --> 00:05:31.830
It really shouldn't do it.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.630
It's in some ways
detrimental to the plant.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.985
It could be a side
effect, a legacy feature,

00:05:38.985 --> 00:05:42.068
or side effect from ancient evolution

00:05:43.021 --> 00:05:45.905
when there was very little
oxygen in the atmosphere,

00:05:45.905 --> 00:05:47.432
and so this didn't seem like that bad

00:05:47.432 --> 00:05:48.553
of an inefficiency.

00:05:48.553 --> 00:05:50.846
But it does happen, and in particular,

00:05:50.846 --> 00:05:54.179
the times where photo-respiration
is more likely to happen

00:05:54.179 --> 00:05:57.834
with typical plants, often
referred to as C three plants,

00:05:57.834 --> 00:06:01.315
and C three is referred to
because the first product

00:06:01.315 --> 00:06:05.877
when you fix the carbon is
a three carbon molecule.

00:06:05.877 --> 00:06:08.244
But this typically
happens, or this happens

00:06:08.244 --> 00:06:12.046
with typical plants in
hotter than normal weather.

00:06:12.046 --> 00:06:13.393
So let me write this down,

00:06:13.393 --> 00:06:15.222
and I'll write it in a hot color.

00:06:15.222 --> 00:06:16.889
Hot, hot conditions.

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:19.478
That's where it typically happens

00:06:19.478 --> 00:06:21.974
with typical plants,

00:06:21.974 --> 00:06:23.881
and why hot conditions?

00:06:23.881 --> 00:06:26.278
Well, in hot conditions, first of all,

00:06:26.278 --> 00:06:28.361
rubiso has more affinity.

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:30.892
Rubisco's affinity,

00:06:35.025 --> 00:06:37.108
affinity to O2 increases.

00:06:39.918 --> 00:06:41.171
So under normal conditions,

00:06:41.171 --> 00:06:43.651
it tends to have more
affinity for carbon dioxide,

00:06:43.651 --> 00:06:44.856
but under hot conditions,

00:06:44.856 --> 00:06:46.281
these proteins are--

00:06:46.281 --> 00:06:47.636
No protein is perfect.

00:06:47.636 --> 00:06:49.211
It can morph a little bit,

00:06:49.211 --> 00:06:52.677
so it has more affinity
to molecular oxygen,

00:06:52.677 --> 00:06:55.886
and also, under hot conditions,

00:06:55.886 --> 00:06:58.587
plants are worried about conserving water,

00:06:58.587 --> 00:07:01.148
and so they will close their stomata,

00:07:01.148 --> 00:07:03.148
stomata, stomata closed,

00:07:06.616 --> 00:07:09.665
to preserve water, but when
the stomata are closed,

00:07:09.665 --> 00:07:12.165
you have CO2 can't diffuse in,

00:07:13.746 --> 00:07:15.163
can't diffuse in,

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:20.533
and O2 can't diffuse out,

00:07:21.624 --> 00:07:23.124
can't diffuse out.

00:07:27.339 --> 00:07:30.737
So your ratio of O2 to CO2 increases.

00:07:30.737 --> 00:07:32.320
So O2 to CO2 ratio,

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.231
ratio increases.

00:07:38.231 --> 00:07:39.943
So under hot weather,

00:07:39.943 --> 00:07:43.787
the rubisco just wants to
work with the oxygen more.

00:07:43.787 --> 00:07:46.663
It typically wants to work
with the carbon dioxide,

00:07:46.663 --> 00:07:48.946
and also, because the stomata's closed,

00:07:48.946 --> 00:07:50.747
and you don't have as easy diffusion,

00:07:50.747 --> 00:07:52.508
well, this ratio is going to increase.

00:07:52.508 --> 00:07:54.732
And so, things are just
more likely to react

00:07:54.732 --> 00:07:55.565
with the oxygen,

00:07:55.565 --> 00:07:57.057
especially the rubisco's
more likely to bump

00:07:57.057 --> 00:07:58.051
into it in the right way

00:07:58.051 --> 00:08:01.036
than it is with the carbon dioxide.

00:08:01.036 --> 00:08:03.172
But let's think a little bit about why

00:08:03.172 --> 00:08:04.987
this is inefficient.

00:08:04.987 --> 00:08:08.570
Well, in this case,
it's fixing the oxygen,

00:08:10.476 --> 00:08:12.524
and so it's not gaining those carbons

00:08:12.524 --> 00:08:16.239
like we just saw in the typical
or the normal Calvin cycle,

00:08:16.239 --> 00:08:18.852
and so here, and you can account--

00:08:18.852 --> 00:08:20.460
I encourage you to keep pausing the video

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.004
and account for the carbons,

00:08:22.004 --> 00:08:25.485
but here, you can no longer produce

00:08:25.485 --> 00:08:28.666
your 12 three carbon molecules,

00:08:28.666 --> 00:08:31.676
'cause you're not getting
these six carbons over here,

00:08:31.676 --> 00:08:34.919
so instead, you can only produce six

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:37.834
of those three carbon molecules,

00:08:37.834 --> 00:08:41.637
and then another six of
a two carbon molecule

00:08:41.637 --> 00:08:44.254
called phosphoglycolate,

00:08:44.254 --> 00:08:46.193
and once again, I'm not
showing all of the oxygens

00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:47.552
and I'm not showing all the phosphates.

00:08:47.552 --> 00:08:49.445
I'm just accounting for the carbons.

00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:51.748
And so, this seems like a pretty bad loss.

00:08:51.748 --> 00:08:55.462
You're not able to use those
carbons right over there.

00:08:55.462 --> 00:08:57.932
Well, evolution has given us pathways

00:08:57.932 --> 00:09:00.204
to at least start to salvage some of it.

00:09:00.204 --> 00:09:03.309
But it's a pretty intense pathway

00:09:03.309 --> 00:09:05.733
to get back some of those carbons,

00:09:05.733 --> 00:09:07.188
and the reason why it wants to get back

00:09:07.188 --> 00:09:08.460
some of those carbons is because,

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.864
remember, at the end of the day,

00:09:09.864 --> 00:09:13.531
you want to attempt to
produce some glucose,

00:09:14.522 --> 00:09:16.807
and you wanna have the
typical or the normal

00:09:16.807 --> 00:09:19.951
Calvin cycle continue to happen,

00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:22.832
but just so you get a sense
of what the salvage pathway

00:09:22.832 --> 00:09:23.942
looks like,

00:09:23.942 --> 00:09:27.359
this two carbon molecule right over here,

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.916
it has to be converted to glycolate,

00:09:30.916 --> 00:09:33.989
then that has to go to the peroxisomes

00:09:33.989 --> 00:09:35.446
where it becomes glycine

00:09:35.446 --> 00:09:36.404
to the mitochondrion,

00:09:36.404 --> 00:09:37.948
and you see this whole process here

00:09:37.948 --> 00:09:39.449
just to be able to salvage it

00:09:39.449 --> 00:09:43.742
into a few more of the
three carbon molecules,

00:09:43.742 --> 00:09:46.558
and that's essentially what
happens right over here.

00:09:46.558 --> 00:09:49.736
We get three more of the
three carbon molecules,

00:09:49.736 --> 00:09:53.121
but we do lose, for the
way I've accounted of it,

00:09:53.121 --> 00:09:55.954
three molecules of carbon dioxide,

00:09:56.929 --> 00:09:58.668
and this one way that why it's called,

00:09:58.668 --> 00:10:00.259
or one reasoning for why it's called

00:10:00.259 --> 00:10:02.524
photo-respiration.

00:10:02.524 --> 00:10:04.748
Respiration, we use oxygen,

00:10:04.748 --> 00:10:06.476
and we produce carbon dioxide,

00:10:06.476 --> 00:10:07.878
and that's exactly what's happening.

00:10:07.878 --> 00:10:11.788
We're using oxygen, and we're
producing carbon dioxide.

00:10:11.788 --> 00:10:14.085
And so, as you see, the mechanism,

00:10:14.085 --> 00:10:16.260
it kind of makes the Calvin cycle--

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:18.967
It disrupts it, or
makes it less efficient.

00:10:18.967 --> 00:10:21.129
And so, once again, why does this happen?

00:10:21.129 --> 00:10:23.156
Well, it could just be a biological quirk

00:10:23.156 --> 00:10:26.157
that has not been selected
strongly enough against,

00:10:26.157 --> 00:10:28.421
or some people believe
it actually has some

00:10:28.421 --> 00:10:30.470
not so well understood mechanism,

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.541
and it somehow helps
the plant in some way,

00:10:33.541 --> 00:10:35.770
but it's a really interesting
thing that goes on,

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:38.222
and, you know, rubisco is not just some

00:10:38.222 --> 00:10:40.194
very fringe molecule.

00:10:40.194 --> 00:10:43.060
As you see, it's central
to the Calvin cycle,

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.620
and if you look at plant matter,

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:46.021
in particular plant leaves,

00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:48.204
it'll represent roughly 20%

00:10:48.204 --> 00:10:51.972
of the protein mass in those plant leaves.

00:10:51.972 --> 00:10:55.555
So it's a very common
protein slash enzyme,

00:10:57.632 --> 00:10:59.054
but it's got this quirk,

00:10:59.054 --> 00:11:01.643
this quirk that takes
the plant down the path

00:11:01.643 --> 00:11:03.476
of photo-respiration.
