00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.290
Washing your hands may be the best way to
keep from getting sick, but in some ways,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.530
DIRT does a body good.

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:07.920
We’ve all been taught that dirt is bad for
us.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.849
In my Grandmother’s house “Cleanliness
was next to Godliness” and everything was

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.300
scrubbed clean and disinfected, but now with
new research on the superpowers of the microbiome

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.609
it may be time to rethink our relationship
with filth.

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.310
You may think dirt and soil are interchangeable,
(they are both a grainy collection of minerals,

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.300
oils, water, and organic matter.)

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.660
BUT soil stays in your backyard while dirt
is what follows you back into your house.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.660
BOTH have microbes.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.580
Germ theory tells us that these microbes can
infect our bodies and make us sick, but we

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.840
are starting to understand that in our haste
to eliminate and defend against disease we

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.140
may have unintentionally “protected” ourselves
against the collaborative relationships we

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.180
need most.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.480
Yes, over exposure to some microorganisms
will make us sick, but of the thousands of

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.610
species and up to 6lbs (yes POUNDS of bacteria
that are living in and on our bodies RIGHT

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.550
NOW some are critical for our health and happiness.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.040
The bacteria that live in our bodies, sometimes
called our microbiome, help us digest food,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.460
respond to pathogens, and may even influence
our moods.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.220
Getting dirty once in a while can help repopulate
“friendly” bacteria that have been killed

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.560
off or washed away by our hygiene practices.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.280
Commonly, we’re taught to clean ourselves
thoroughly to prevent illness *but* we could

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.680
be killing off too much good bacteria.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.670
Studies show that we need exposure to both
friendly and unfriendly bacteria to maintain

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.910
health and a strong immune system.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.810
Some exposure to disease causing pathogens
early in life, helps to build our body’s

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.590
defences keeping us healthy as adults.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.900
When our body “fights” a disease, it is
activating immune cells in response to a remembered

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.900
disease agent.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.190
The Hygiene Hypothesis suggests that the right
amount of exposure to germs and dirt builds

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.270
our body’s library of known diseases, and
teaches our immune system to remember which

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.110
microbes, proteins, and viruses are dangerous.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.080
Without this training, our immune system may
become hyperactive, looking for diseases to

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.409
fight and it may find innocuous aspects of
our own biology instead.

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.849
When the body attacks itself, it can cause
autoimmune disorders such as asthma and Inflammatory

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.909
Bowel Disorder.

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.400
An example of this was seen in a study of
germ-free mice that had been raised in a sterile

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.400
environment.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.349
The mice were compared to normal mice living
in a microbe rich environment.

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.090
The germ-free mice were found to have several
immune disorders such as inflammation of the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.019
lungs and colon which resemble human asthma
and colitis.

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:34.709
These conditions were caused by hyperactivity
of a type of immune cell that had been previously

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.389
linked to these diseases in both mice and
humans.

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:42.340
Most importantly, the researchers discovered
that exposing the germ-free mice to microbes

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.269
when they were babies, led to development
of a regular immune response and proper defense

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.599
against disease.

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.709
So, playing in the dirt as a kid is good for
you and adults it’s not too late!

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.260
Put that hand sanitizer away, go hiking, pet
that dog, explore different environments and

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.019
all that good bacteria.

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.099
GET MESSY!

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.580
Remember, in our haste to make our living
conditions more sterile, we may be making

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.639
ourselves sick.

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.779

Make sure you subscribe and check out some
of these microbes living in the driest place

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.230
on earth on our sister show, Science in the
Extremes

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.019
Fun fact: If you’re craving dirt, you might
be pregnant!

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.230
The desire to eat dirt is called geophagy,
and it is commonly observed in children and

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.220
pregnant women.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.320
Weird!
