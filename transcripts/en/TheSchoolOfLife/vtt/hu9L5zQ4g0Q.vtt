00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:09.560
One of the hardest things to describe or to be properly aware of is what it feels like to be inside our own minds.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:14.420
The second-by-second flow of images, words, feelings and sounds

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.100
inside our heads that philosophers call: our Consciousness.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.700
All day, this consiousness is filled with a tangle of material that flashes by an observing eye

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:35.900
so fast and in so multi-layered and dense array; we can generally only rest and focus on a minuscule part of what is before us.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:44.020
There are waves of sensations, fog-banks of moods, collisions of ideas and swirls of associations and impressions.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.300
Consciousness doesn't just unfold on a single cinema screen of the mind either.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.260
We can think of it more like a multi, multi-plex where a dozen or more moods and emotions

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.780
are projected at once in a fractured collection of images, reminiscent of a puzzling collage of Avant Garde videos.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.560
Most of what we have felt and have been, will disappear before it can ever be held and examined.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.660
Furthermore, little of the richness of consciousness ever makes it out into public discussion.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.980
When we open our mouths and tell other people, for example:

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.760
what we think or how we're feeling. We have no option but to radically simplify the nature of experience

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:31.440
like a journalist filing a 100 word piece on a battle or political revolution to an indifferent, domestic audience a continent away.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.980
We might say we've had a "quiet day so far" or are "fairly cheerful at the moment."

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:45.780
And a generous social code means we don't remind one another of what an inaccurate portrait this must necessarily be.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.380
Part of the reason why we're not quite aware of the true nature of consciousness is the fault of literature.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:01.580
In most of the novels we read, characters are attributed an utterly implausible, yet superficially beguiling, clarity of mental functioning.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.700
For example: the influential, 19th Century, English novelist: Anthony Trollope,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.640
liked to offer his readers a snapshot of what was supposed to be going on in his characters' heads.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:19.700
In his novel: Phineas Finn, a man is elected to parliament and Trollope describes him travelling by train to the capital to take up his post

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.020
and musing moodily on his political prospects.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.320
He had many serious, almost solemn thoughts on his journey to London.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.620
He wondered if he would make a failure of the great matter he had taken in hand.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.420
He could not but tell himself that the chances were twenty to one against.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.900
Now that he looked at it, the difficulties loomed larger than ever!

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:47.720
Trollope gives us the sincere impression that this really is how human beings think when they sit down on trains and consider their futures.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.600
The sort of novels that Trollope wrote have even been described as extremely "realistic".

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:59.940
And yet the problem is that, of course, no human who has ever existed, actually thinks or feels remotely like this.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.760
It took until the early 20th Century of writers to focus on and respond to this foreshortening.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.300
In 1918, in his great novel Ulysses, the Irish writer James Joyce, for the first time, made the move of putting

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.580
a kind of microphone inside his characters' minds

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.620
to pick up on what became known as: 'The Stream of Consciousness'.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.020
It sounded radically different from anything Trollope or past novelists had ever described.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:33.540
At one point in Ulysses, we hear the stream of consciousness of a heroine Molly as she lies in bed beside her husband Bloom in the middle of the night.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.380
Is he dreaming?

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.020
Am I in it?

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.000
He smells of some kind of drink not whiskey perhaps the sweety kind of paste

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.960
they put posters up with. I'd like to sip green and yellow expensive drinks staged or Johnny's drink.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.560
I tasted one with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel. He must have eaten oysters.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.660
I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel fuller.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.580
What's the idea of making us like that with a big hole in the middle.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.800
I hate people who come at all hours, answer the door and you're all undressed.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.900
We come to know more about our own consciousness via Joyce's unusual portrait of Molly's.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.120
Like ours, Molly's mind moves extremely fast from one topic to another.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.900
At one moment she's thinking about liqueurs, then about an American she met at the theter then a second later

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.180
she's wondering if her husband's been eating oysters.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.060
Then she thinks about his penis. Then she wonders about her own body.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.020
Then gets irked by the idea of people coming around to the house when she's not ready to open the door.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.320
There's no dominant central theme that gets carefully explored.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:35.040
Despite the monstrous complexity, Ulysses, arguably, still amounts to a radical simplification of the true nature of experience.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:40.700
After all, the novel exists only as words, wheras our real stream of consciousness includes

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.540
a disjointed and random streaming of films and pictures.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.320
Images constantly flit across consciousness.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:54.320
Sometimes we'll see something extraordinarily specific, a door handle from 27 years ago or an image of a boat on a canal in Western France

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.680
or remember looking out of a train on a journey through Germany,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.900
but there'll be no further details or real sense as to why this has come into our heads right now.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:11.860
Nevertheless, Joyce's work is hugely significant because it helps us to start to see what we're up against when we try to understand our own minds.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.460
It is not a case of just opening up a hatch and finding a welter of well-formulated thoughts.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:25.080
When we turn our attention to ourselves, we won't be able to locate crystalline attitudes and precise ideas.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.120
We will discover only chaos and illusive thoughts.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:37.660
More significantly, it's from this prime-evil mulch, that we will have to assemble the solid and serious plans we need to navigate through existence.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.320
We have to decide: What we care about? How we should direct our lives? Who we should try to be?

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:52.060
Knowing more about the stream of consciousness prepares us for the work that we have to do to pull out from the stream, the decent and accurate thoughts we need.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:59.820
The mind won't automatically yield clear answers when we ask ourselves what we think or where we might direct our energies.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:06.700
There can naturally be a temptation to avoid the hard work and there are some alternatives to proper introspection.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.340
Some of the content we hold in our minds is coherent and very easy to grasp,

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.420
but it suffers from a marked draw-back: it isn't really ours.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.900
It's second-hand, stale and a derivative bank of ideas and plans.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.320
We have certain notions in our heads that come, not from our deeper resources of feeling and intuition

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.100
but from what we have sucked in uncritically from outside

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.200
from what we've read in the newspaper or heard about from parents or friends.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.720
These are: our received ideas.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.560
We don't need to think hard at all to regurgitate them.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.820
They're just waiting in prepackaged form in the reception room of our minds.

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:48.480
An yet, it's only the thoughts and feelings that are originally unprocessed that come from the caverns in ourselves

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.900
that are the ones richest in information.

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.700
Even if they're also, painfully, the hardest to make sense of.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:04.120
Knowing a little more about the stream of consciousness shows us that our brains are a more delicate, messier organ than we're normally allowed to imagine.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:11.820
Many of the introspective tasks we set ourselves turn out to be more fiddly and are going to need more resources than we typically allow for.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.740
Yet the rewards for mastering introspection correctly are immense.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:23.220
For it's by becoming experts in our own streams of consciousness that we have the chance truly to understand who we are.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:31.340
and thereby to align our lives with the way we really feel and with the goals that can truly satisfy us when we reach them.
