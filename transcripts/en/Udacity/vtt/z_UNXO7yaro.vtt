00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.010
All of us routinely use file systems. Quite often, not the one that is

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:11.480
on our local machine, be it a desktop or laptop, but one that is on a local area

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.770
network, connecting us to a workplace or university.

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.910
NFS, which stands for Network File System. And

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:26.190
just like the word xerox is used often as a verb, to denote copying, NFS has

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.680
become a generic name to signify any file

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.540
system that we access remotely. So here is

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.466
a trivia quiz for you. NFS is a name given to the first network file system that

00:00:37.466 --> 00:00:42.700
was ever built. In this question I want you to name the company and the year

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.570
that NFS was first built. And the company

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.600
choices for you are all familiar names: IBM, Sun

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.410
Microsystems, HP, Apple, Microsoft, and

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.684
Google. And here are the choices of years for you 1975, 85, 95, 2005.
