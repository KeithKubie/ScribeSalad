Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad. And I'm Robert Krulwich. And this is radiolab,

2
00:00:03.091 --> 00:00:07.800
the podcast and not Radiolab the, the real show. Other one.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.161
No,

4
00:00:08.161 --> 00:00:11.040
this is a shorty in this podcast we're gonna take you to New York City to the

5
00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:14.850
92nd street y where I do a series called giants of science.

6
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:19.830
And on one night something very cool happened with Amy answer.

7
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.010
I thought you were, I thought I saw you there in row three,

8
00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.380
but I can't remember anything I tell him. Tell him I'll set up the guest is,

9
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:29.670
well, I'm not even, I don't have to,

10
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.360
let's just go to the hall and Robert on tape. We'll take over from here.

11
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.440
The, the man you are about to me is,

12
00:00:37.441 --> 00:00:40.020
he's a professor at Columbia University of mathematics.

13
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.750
He's also a professor of Physics at Columbia University.

14
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.990
He's also the director of the Institute for Strings,

15
00:00:45.991 --> 00:00:49.350
cosmology and Astro Particle Physics at Columbia University.

16
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.570
He's also a best selling author.

17
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.820
He's also done work in what's called mirror symmetry,

18
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:57.630
which means I'm not sure what exactly, uh, it involves my,

19
00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.050
my relating to different Columbia manifolds or letting the kind of fold to one

20
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:04.290
of the orbit folds, which I'm sure you know all about. He's a road scholar.

21
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.210
He's the author of the elegant universe of basically, he's not a dumb person,

22
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.320
not at all, but he does however,

23
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.940
believed the most peculiar things. So if you ask him, and I will,

24
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.600
he believes that if you travel from this room,

25
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.980
from this auditorium on 92nd street and Lexington Avenue in pretty much any

26
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:26.700
direction at all, but if you have to go really, really, really far,

27
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:31.020
light years upon light, years upon light, years out, you will,

28
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.670
if you travel far enough, eventually find a galaxy and,

29
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.910
but let it looks and I mean exactly like our Milky Way.

30
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.930
And in that galaxy you will find a planet that is an absolute copy,

31
00:01:42.931 --> 00:01:44.700
a dead ringer for our planet earth.

32
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.900
And on that planet you will find a city that is uncannily down to the hairs on

33
00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:49.950
the city rats.

34
00:01:49.951 --> 00:01:54.240
Exactly like this city in New York City and in that city there will be another

35
00:01:54.241 --> 00:01:58.350
92nd street, y, W Y, m, h. A.

36
00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.260
Were they building it as another auditory minute?

37
00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.530
That is exactly like this auditorium here and if you think that's an unlikely

38
00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:04.981
coincidence,

39
00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:08.910
I'm just getting started because I think Brian can will also tell you that in

40
00:02:08.911 --> 00:02:12.570
that distant distant distant auditorium on the other side of the cosmos

41
00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:15.270
backstage waiting to come on stage,

42
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.600
there is a nother professor who also teaches both mathematics and physics at his

43
00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:23.670
school. That just happens to also be called Columbia University,

44
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.920
who's also the director of Written Institute for Strings,

45
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:30.921
cosmology and Astro particle physics who also just happens to be named Brian

46
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.900
Green with an e on the end. Like this one,

47
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.680
the one out here who happens to have an identical set of also two sisters and

48
00:02:37.681 --> 00:02:40.620
the same mother and the same father with the same memories down to what he ate

49
00:02:40.621 --> 00:02:41.580
this morning for breakfast,

50
00:02:41.581 --> 00:02:44.700
which would not be an egg because the far away Brian Green,

51
00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:49.530
like the nearby Brian Green are both of them vegans and we're not. We're not,

52
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.210
we're not favoring vacants tonight we're just mentioning Vegas and in these two

53
00:02:54.211 --> 00:02:58.140
rooms, these two identical professors with their identical paths are going to be

54
00:02:58.141 --> 00:03:01.610
talking to yes and identical audience watching. What'd you do?

55
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.320
The exact copy of every one of you sitting here in this room right now with all

56
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:07.210
your histories and all your memories,

57
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.110
your exact copies are sitting in that other room on the other side of the

58
00:03:11.111 --> 00:03:13.150
universe, including you.

59
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.010
You in particular and you [inaudible] and if you think no self-respecting

60
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:20.980
Columbia University professor would actually, I don't mean this poetically,

61
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:25.690
but actually believe that there's a copy of us on the other side to make it even

62
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:26.524
crazier.

63
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.550
Brian Green believes there's not only one doppelganger room with a doppelganger.

64
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.710
Brian meaning the doppelganger audience, he leads.

65
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:36.640
There are countless doubles of us in every direction out there in the great

66
00:03:36.641 --> 00:03:37.660
beyond and what's more,

67
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.200
there are rooms exactly like this one with just you missing or just me missing

68
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.240
or the color of my shirt. Slightly different. In other words,

69
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.560
any big enough cosmos in an infinite cosmos, Brian Green, things that,

70
00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.060
anything you could imagine,

71
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:57.061
almost anything that can be out there will be out there really out there to

72
00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:01.990
which I say, oh good,

73
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.960
cause you really believe this. And if so, why? So let's ask him.

74
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:08.890
Let's welcome the local homegrown version of a man. I like to call Brian Green.

75
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.353
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

76
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:24.770
<v 0>so far so good. Did I get it right? More or less?</v>

77
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.830
There's an assumption you left out, but we can get to that. Okay.

78
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.580
Let's talk about two words, infinite and universities to infinite.

79
00:04:31.581 --> 00:04:36.200
First we're going to start by discussing what you have in a manuscript you're

80
00:04:36.201 --> 00:04:38.180
working on. Now you've described it as the amalgam,

81
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.090
Imelda Marcos wardrobe problem. So we, we, we,

82
00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.970
we have a woman here who does not like c being seen in the same outfit twice.

83
00:04:46.971 --> 00:04:48.650
So tell us what, how she solved it.

84
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.470
<v 2>Ah, that's an interesting way to get into the subject.</v>

85
00:04:51.471 --> 00:04:55.820
I didn't anticipate that that is where we would begin, but that's good. Um, the,

86
00:04:55.821 --> 00:04:58.430
the issue that you're referring to is the following.

87
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.880
If you have a finite number of distinct ways in this particular case of

88
00:05:05.691 --> 00:05:06.800
dressing, right,

89
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.280
and you have say an infinite number of days and evenings on what you have to

90
00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:13.580
step out,

91
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.180
then it's pretty clear that you're going to have to repeat an outfit once,

92
00:05:20.151 --> 00:05:20.631
twice,

93
00:05:20.631 --> 00:05:25.631
in fact innumerable times because you only say had 10 different outfits.

94
00:05:25.671 --> 00:05:29.120
Or in the case of Emelda, the example there,

95
00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.920
I forget how many hundred dresses and 1000 pairs of designer shoes, right?

96
00:05:33.921 --> 00:05:34.460
There you go.

97
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.750
So you can envision the number of distinct combinations of dresses and shoes.

98
00:05:38.751 --> 00:05:41.570
Very easy to figure it out just 500 times a thousand.

99
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.450
And then if they're more than that many days,

100
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:48.710
then that individual that Amelda is going to have to repeat is going to have to

101
00:05:48.711 --> 00:05:52.700
repeat a given outfit if they're say infinitely many days and only find it

102
00:05:52.701 --> 00:05:57.010
number of outfits. Simple idea. So just to make it simpler,

103
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.240
still are clear as still, let's do it as a coin toss.

104
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:04.270
The odds against me getting say a thousand heads in a row if we're be

105
00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:10.490
infinitesimal. But if I kept tossing and tossing, and if I tossed infinitely,

106
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.700
then of course I'm going to hit. That's right.

107
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:18.080
You do a thousand coin tosses over and over and over again,

108
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.420
and look at all of the outcomes.

109
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:25.400
Then even the most strange kind of outcomes will appear such as all heads.

110
00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.290
And in fact, if you flip those coins enough times, say infinitely many times,

111
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.730
then that strange outcome will actually appear rarely,

112
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:36.230
but infinitely many times.

113
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:42.890
So now let's just use that logic and apply it to just a different kind of

114
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:47.120
system. Imagine a cosmos, which has into infinite space.

115
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.800
Now the key thing here I think is that, um,

116
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.880
the stuff in the cosmos you believe has some kind of finite set of rules.

117
00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:00.980
So let's take a her, this woman in, in what do you, are you in the pinkish?

118
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:02.960
Kind of, yeah. Rip. Okay.

119
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.910
So she is a compilation of Adams,

120
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.920
which follows certain rules. Her memories are, I assume,

121
00:07:12.921 --> 00:07:15.980
you think also Adam's. I do not.

122
00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:20.981
Everybody agrees that every aspect of your personality and your conscious being

123
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.330
is reduceable to a configuration of the atoms that make up your brain.

124
00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.590
But I certainly believe that. And that's [inaudible] memories. That's right.

125
00:07:30.591 --> 00:07:31.550
There's nothing else.

126
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:34.850
All you are is a bag of particles acting out the laws of physics.

127
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:39.020
That to me is pretty clear. However, it does tasteful you,

128
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.540
the kiss of God. We just don't include in this story. You can if you'd like.

129
00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:47.660
I just don't see any particular need for it. So for this discussion,

130
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.480
oh well come on, we got to applaud. Uh, so,

131
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.910
so if she is just a large number of atoms,

132
00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:03.140
any particular array, but let's say she can,

133
00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.600
um, we can travel infinitely and look at all of,

134
00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:13.190
and we're talking here what I guess about particles are about forces or about,

135
00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:16.710
you can reduce everything, basically two particles. That's a,

136
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.760
that's a fine way of phrasing the whole conversation.

137
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:24.050
And the idea that you're getting at is indeed the fact that if the universe is

138
00:08:24.051 --> 00:08:27.770
infinitely big, the rough idea that we can make precise in a moment.

139
00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:29.030
If it's infinitely big,

140
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:33.260
then the number of distinct configurations of particles,

141
00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:37.580
like the number of distinct possible coin tosses actually is finite.

142
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:41.840
And if the universe is infinitely big than just as your coin toss is have to

143
00:08:41.841 --> 00:08:46.310
repeat, the configurations of the particles will have to repeat.

144
00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.660
So you go sufficiently far out there and the configuration of particles will

145
00:08:50.661 --> 00:08:55.661
repeat and will indeed make a configuration of particles that looks just like

146
00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:56.400
this room

147
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.920
<v 0>looks on the outside or is so.</v>

148
00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.880
So she had a dream last night about a black cat walking on a,

149
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.140
on a fire escape.

150
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.790
She is also deeply in love with the men next to her and they share an enormous

151
00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:13.710
number of of, of experiences together and she's wearing the pink thing,

152
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.440
the red. So we have a lot of Adam's,

153
00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:19.980
they're doing very different things if indeed they're doing these things at all.

154
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.000
You say that that combination,

155
00:09:24.001 --> 00:09:29.001
the intimate inside and outside come into here will be found elsewhere again and

156
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:30.114
again and again?

157
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.280
<v 2>Yes. Has Mattress saying both?</v>

158
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:36.430
I'm saying that the outside will be found with a distinct inside many places out

159
00:09:36.801 --> 00:09:37.634
there,

160
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:42.140
but the outside would the same inside will also be found out there because

161
00:09:42.141 --> 00:09:42.351
again,

162
00:09:42.351 --> 00:09:45.860
it's just another configuration of the particles and since there are only a

163
00:09:45.861 --> 00:09:49.160
finite number of distinct possibilities, that's a huge finite number.

164
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:51.410
It's the Gargantuan finite number,

165
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.220
but it's a finite number and if he goes sufficiently far out,

166
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.580
there's just so many distinct configurations that there can be if they're

167
00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.600
finally many, so if he goes to efficiently, far out, you have to repeat,

168
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:09.490
but won't you run into a trillion people almost like her [inaudible] much easier

169
00:10:11.301 --> 00:10:13.280
to reproduce this,

170
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.450
this woman in the first row with one particle in a different place or two

171
00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:21.140
particles in different, those are much easier because there's less constraint.

172
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.400
If you want to reproduce this individual completely.

173
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:28.910
Every single particle has to be in the right place.

174
00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:34.150
<v 0>That just means you have to go a little further. Now you,</v>

175
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.610
I know we're speaking here and this is, this makes perfectly logical sense.

176
00:10:39.611 --> 00:10:42.100
It just makes absolutely no practical sense obviously,

177
00:10:42.101 --> 00:10:45.610
but I'm also wondering whether it makes sense to you as a person.

178
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.920
Do you seriously think,

179
00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:52.690
do you literally think that there are two people exactly like us with our

180
00:10:52.691 --> 00:10:53.111
dreams,

181
00:10:53.111 --> 00:10:57.090
our thoughts a little bit about it in some other stage right now or whatever you

182
00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.760
would call now over and over again right now,

183
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.460
all over the universe or you just say that

184
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.633
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

185
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:09.291
<v 2>well,</v>

186
00:11:09.291 --> 00:11:13.340
there's a key element that we have been assuming and we've been assuming that

187
00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:17.480
the universe is infinitely big and we don't know that the universe is infinitely

188
00:11:17.481 --> 00:11:21.780
big. It could be that you go on for some distance and you walk in,

189
00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:24.290
you walk and you wind up coming back from that direction.

190
00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:27.140
Sort of like the surface of the earth. It has a certain size.

191
00:11:27.141 --> 00:11:30.350
It's not infinitely big. It doesn't have an edge. You can't fall off,

192
00:11:30.351 --> 00:11:33.770
but nevertheless, when you keep on going, you return to your starting point.

193
00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:36.770
It could be that the universe has that kind of a shape.

194
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:41.060
The data seems not to support that at all. At the moment. The best.

195
00:11:41.061 --> 00:11:44.870
Astronomical data does not support that as the parts of the universe that is

196
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:48.740
flat as opposed to curved. And if that's the case,

197
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:53.890
it's still possible that the universe could be sort of like a surface of the

198
00:11:55.061 --> 00:11:59.680
earth in the sense that it might be like the surface of a video game screen.

199
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.320
If anybody who plays pac-man or any of the other video,

200
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:06.580
you know that you know when Ms Pacman falls off the right side of the screen,

201
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.820
you know she doesn't disappear. She comes back on the left side of the screen.

202
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.310
That's another possible shape for the university has a,

203
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.300
it's called the Taurus and our universe might have that particular shape. Again,

204
00:12:16.301 --> 00:12:19.030
it's a finite shape, but you can't fall off.

205
00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.010
We don't believe you can fall out of the universe.

206
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:24.160
So that would be a way to have a finite universe where you don't fall off.

207
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:25.683
However,

208
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:30.880
the other possibility is simply that it goes on forever and we don't know which

209
00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:35.320
is right. The simplest one mathematically is that it's simply goes on forever.

210
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:38.890
And if that's the shape of the universe, then yes,

211
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.950
I fully believe that we are out there in some notion of now having this

212
00:12:44.531 --> 00:12:49.390
conversation not once, not twice, infinitely, many times.

213
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.810
Well, aside from the deep creepy news, well let's talk about the creepiness. It,

214
00:12:55.150 --> 00:12:59.710
I mean there is an, uh, a notion that we all have,

215
00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:03.820
that we are unique individuals and that there is a real version of us,

216
00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:08.290
in my case, you're looking at him. So you just said that a million,

217
00:13:08.291 --> 00:13:12.610
billion times over in the other universities. Uh,

218
00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:16.180
well, so where does that leave you?

219
00:13:16.181 --> 00:13:18.970
Do you just feel like personal identity is very odd?

220
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:24.760
418 or personal identity in this context is very, very strange.

221
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:29.790
There's literally no difference between me and the other guy out there.

222
00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:35.380
And that's okay with me. I don't really have a problem with that.

223
00:13:35.381 --> 00:13:40.381
But I do agree that it challenges your sense of what your personal identity is

224
00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:44.680
all about. You're the collection of your memories,

225
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:49.780
which are ultimately just to collection of impressions in your brain,

226
00:13:49.781 --> 00:13:52.600
just the collection of particle configurations.

227
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.470
And if that other individual has the same brain configuration because the

228
00:13:56.471 --> 00:13:59.680
particles are in a identical state as they are in my head,

229
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.970
that person is as much me as I am me.

230
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.200
So it doesn't that automatically make you want to quickly run off the stage,

231
00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:09.220
hide under a pillow,

232
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.520
do something that the other guy could never find out and then be different.

233
00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.540
Well, I know that he'll have exactly the same thought,

234
00:14:16.541 --> 00:14:18.220
so it won't help me very much.

235
00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.850
But that's really creepy to be chased around by the, by the,

236
00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.520
by the infinite number of doppelgangers so that what you,

237
00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.260
everything you will to do,

238
00:14:26.261 --> 00:14:29.890
they also will to do simultaneously and there are infinitely others that will do

239
00:14:29.891 --> 00:14:33.820
something slightly different. So there's just a richness to the world,

240
00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:37.150
but his complexion is somewhat different than what you had in mind.

241
00:14:37.151 --> 00:14:40.210
I think most of us have in mind that if the universe is infinitely big,

242
00:14:40.211 --> 00:14:44.020
you keep on going. You'd see new landscapes keep on going,

243
00:14:44.021 --> 00:14:46.390
you'd see new stuff, new stuff, new stuff.

244
00:14:46.391 --> 00:14:51.380
That's our picture of what reality is and that kind of a universe, our universe.

245
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:56.180
And I'm saying that the laws of physics don't support that notion.

246
00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.060
The Laws of physics support, yes, it's a rich world out there,

247
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:02.570
but the distinct landscapes, the distinct environments,

248
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:05.030
the distinct configurations that you can see are limited.

249
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:10.850
What about how far away is the nearest one to me? Well,

250
00:15:10.851 --> 00:15:14.570
that's a good question. You can actually calculate that.

251
00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.120
And as you might imagine,

252
00:15:17.121 --> 00:15:21.860
it's a pretty big number because I'll give you a number from a guy named mark

253
00:15:21.861 --> 00:15:23.990
Tegmark at MIT. I have no idea what this means.

254
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:28.880
What is 10 to the power of 10 to the 29th meters?

255
00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:34.980
Uh, that's a big number. And um, you know,

256
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:39.030
you, you know what it means. It's not like high, it's not, not, uh, well, just,

257
00:15:39.031 --> 00:15:40.090
just to quickly say what they mean is,

258
00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:43.490
I think you're familiar with what tend to the two means. It's a hundred,

259
00:15:43.491 --> 00:15:46.490
just a one with two zeroes following it. In this particular case,

260
00:15:46.491 --> 00:15:51.320
you take 10 to the 29, that's a big number. One with 29 zeroes after it.

261
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.200
And then you take 10 to that number,

262
00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:00.160
which is that many zeroes following tend to the 29 Zeros following the one and

263
00:16:00.681 --> 00:16:04.240
it's so big that we don't have a name for, I mean called the Krulwich.

264
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:04.861
What I mean it's a,

265
00:16:04.861 --> 00:16:09.861
it's a huge number and it just is commensurate with the fact that even though

266
00:16:09.951 --> 00:16:12.680
we're saying that there are finite number of ways that my particles,

267
00:16:12.681 --> 00:16:15.050
my electrons, my protons, my corks,

268
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.410
there's a finite number of distinct ways that they can be configured.

269
00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:23.300
It's a huge number. So you have to flip that coin many, many,

270
00:16:23.301 --> 00:16:27.320
many times before you reproduce that particular sequence,

271
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:30.920
this particular configuration. But in an infinite universe,

272
00:16:30.921 --> 00:16:35.090
let me just stress and an infant universe tend to attend to the 29 is really

273
00:16:35.091 --> 00:16:35.924
small.

274
00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:41.020
I mean infinity is a hard concept to wrap your mind around.

275
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.470
I mean, you take half of infinity, you've got infinity,

276
00:16:45.471 --> 00:16:48.230
you take a third of infinity, you take attempt of infant,

277
00:16:48.231 --> 00:16:51.020
you've got infinity still. So this number,

278
00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.930
however big it may seem by human standards,

279
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.500
it's just a little tiny blip in this infinite cosmos. Well,

280
00:16:57.501 --> 00:17:00.200
there was one other assumption that we made and I just maybe I should call

281
00:17:00.201 --> 00:17:00.800
attention to it.

282
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:05.800
You said that all of the particles that make her up and all of the forces that

283
00:17:06.501 --> 00:17:10.400
join those particles are a finite group.

284
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.793
Um,

285
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:17.630
and how do you know that all you know is what you can see here where we are.

286
00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:23.240
Why wouldn't you know w who says, well again,

287
00:17:23.241 --> 00:17:26.780
there are underlying assumptions that the laws of physics that we know about

288
00:17:26.781 --> 00:17:29.930
here are the laws of physics that govern the universe everywhere.

289
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.120
That's again a, a rather simple assumption that we don't know to be true.

290
00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:38.930
Certainly our observations of the universe suggests that the parts that we can

291
00:17:38.931 --> 00:17:43.931
see visually are governed by the same laws of physics that govern the phenomenon

292
00:17:44.301 --> 00:17:45.710
that we can see the world around us.

293
00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.040
That doesn't prove that if he goes sufficiently far out, the laws might change.

294
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.140
Simplest assumption is that they don't change.

295
00:17:52.141 --> 00:17:55.680
And that's certainly what I am assuming. And then the idea is, you know,

296
00:17:55.681 --> 00:17:59.430
perhaps it's slightly confusing focusing on one individual's particles.

297
00:17:59.431 --> 00:18:03.510
What we really mean is all of the particles in the observable universe,

298
00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:08.620
that part of the universe that can influence itself by virtue of exchanging

299
00:18:08.731 --> 00:18:10.830
particles and exchanging forces.

300
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:16.100
This particular part of the universe has a certain large number of particles and

301
00:18:17.671 --> 00:18:21.420
that large number of particles has a large number of possible arrangements,

302
00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.810
but a finite large number of possible arrangements.

303
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.280
So in most of those arrangements,

304
00:18:26.281 --> 00:18:30.060
there won't be people at all because the particles will be haphazardly arranged

305
00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:34.470
and they want to have coalesced into structures that we call humans and some of

306
00:18:34.471 --> 00:18:37.470
those universities, there'll be one lonely human,

307
00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.730
the only person that's formed out of the particles in that universe and a very

308
00:18:41.731 --> 00:18:45.930
tiny fraction. There'll be universes that look like ours. Well,

309
00:18:45.931 --> 00:18:49.770
since you've slipped in this pleural for universe, now, universe says,

310
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:52.290
let let's cause I don't know that. I should just let you do that.

311
00:18:52.291 --> 00:18:56.850
Let's just do that. When you use the word, when I used the word universe,

312
00:18:56.910 --> 00:19:01.590
I use it in the common sense that it includes everything that we know of or that

313
00:19:01.591 --> 00:19:06.220
we can imagine. That seems to not be even remotely what you're doing. Uh,

314
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:11.310
well, we found that that notion of universe, however,

315
00:19:11.311 --> 00:19:13.650
all encompassing it sounds,

316
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:18.980
is a little too coarse to accurately describe modern thinking about how the

317
00:19:21.211 --> 00:19:23.070
physical universe actually works.

318
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.400
And we find it more useful to have words that delineate the universe with finer

319
00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:35.220
characteristics than lumping it all together into everything that you can

320
00:19:35.221 --> 00:19:37.920
imagine. Everything that's out there. So for instance,

321
00:19:37.921 --> 00:19:42.720
we imagine the observable universe that's the part of the universe that you can,

322
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:47.580
in principle see with a sufficiently powerful telescope with a sufficiently

323
00:19:47.581 --> 00:19:48.630
powerful receiver,

324
00:19:48.631 --> 00:19:52.740
you'd be able to exchange signals with those parts of the universe.

325
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.940
We believe that there are parts of the universe that are just beyond our ability

326
00:19:56.941 --> 00:20:01.140
to see because there's not enough time since the beginning for light or any

327
00:20:01.141 --> 00:20:04.500
other influence to travel from that distant location to us.

328
00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:08.040
So that's a part of the universe that's kind of separate from us.

329
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:10.170
It's not within the observable universe.

330
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:14.790
So some people like to think of our observable universe as one contained

331
00:20:14.791 --> 00:20:18.900
universe and those other regions, as in some sense other universes,

332
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.850
they're not that distinct. In principle,

333
00:20:20.851 --> 00:20:23.970
you can get to them if you travel sufficiently far.

334
00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:27.990
They're just regions that are beyond our ability to exchange influence with

335
00:20:27.991 --> 00:20:31.020
today in a Christopher Columbus sort of way, you get on a boat,

336
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:33.240
you ride to the rise, and you go over the horizon,

337
00:20:33.241 --> 00:20:36.630
you keep going and you'll see something that no one has seen before that you

338
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.690
knew. Yes, hugely. So. In fact, we use the same word horizon,

339
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.420
so just as you mentioned,

340
00:20:42.421 --> 00:20:46.560
Christopher Columbus can look to the horizon and knows that there's something

341
00:20:46.561 --> 00:20:49.180
beyond horizon but can't actually see it.

342
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:54.190
We look out into the cosmos as far as we can and we believe that there's stuff

343
00:20:54.191 --> 00:20:57.640
beyond what we can see beyond our cosmic horizon.

344
00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.890
<v 0>How much space can we see?</v>

345
00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.590
What's the observable? Oh,

346
00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:09.990
roughly 42 billion light years in any given direction. 40 to go. That's the,

347
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:14.460
that's the the entire diameter. I mean, that's all the way across.

348
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:17.640
You turned to the left, you look some number that way.

349
00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.750
<v 2>Exactly right. So you look out this way,</v>

350
00:21:19.751 --> 00:21:21.980
you can see about 42 billion lights going to light years,

351
00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:26.170
the best 6 trillion miles. So it's again, it's far, but it's a finite size.

352
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.960
What is your hunch if you do a Columbus,

353
00:21:28.961 --> 00:21:32.890
you go over the horizon and you travel or oh no, let's, let's stay.

354
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:35.380
<v 0>If you're in the, the observable universe,</v>

355
00:21:35.381 --> 00:21:39.850
but you move over 800,000 light years to the right.

356
00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.590
Right. Um,

357
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.520
so can you now see stuff that people from here couldn't see cause you're now

358
00:21:45.521 --> 00:21:46.690
over there. Oh, absolutely.

359
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:51.040
You have any sense of whether the stuff you're going to see will be America big

360
00:21:51.041 --> 00:21:53.440
surprise or just more of the same?

361
00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:58.170
<v 2>Uh, it will in that small motion that you described,</v>

362
00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.960
say 42 billion plus light years,

363
00:22:01.410 --> 00:22:04.320
we believe that will be particles,

364
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.680
entities that obey the same laws of physics,

365
00:22:07.681 --> 00:22:12.120
that particles and entities in our observable part behave according to the same

366
00:22:12.121 --> 00:22:14.850
rules. But there'll be configured somewhat differently.

367
00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:18.120
You won't see another America if that's what you're asking out there because

368
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:23.390
it's so unlikely you need to go far enough away that you sample more possible

369
00:22:24.181 --> 00:22:27.060
configurations and then just one the neighbor next door.

370
00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.380
That's as if you said to me,

371
00:22:28.381 --> 00:22:33.360
if I take a coin and I flip it once and I get a particular sequence, heads,

372
00:22:33.361 --> 00:22:36.300
tails, heads, heads, tails. If I flip it a second time,

373
00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.210
will I get exactly the same sequence? That's unlikely.

374
00:22:39.211 --> 00:22:44.010
It's possible but unlikely. But if I flipped that five coins sequence,

375
00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:48.030
if I do it a billion times, will I ever get that same sequence? Yes,

376
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:49.103
<v 0>very likely.</v>

377
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:55.640
So if w w is there a place out there where conceivably what is predictable over

378
00:23:00.031 --> 00:23:04.980
here, changes out there. Is there, is there any neighborhood

379
00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:09.070
<v 2>the laws actually might condemn? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So in fact,</v>

380
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:13.090
when we studied modern cosmology with greater intensity,

381
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:18.390
we find that it's probably likely that if you examine the universe from say a

382
00:23:19.301 --> 00:23:24.220
God's eye view, so using that capital u universe that you started with,

383
00:23:24.221 --> 00:23:26.860
if you can sort of see in some sense the whole thing,

384
00:23:26.861 --> 00:23:29.520
not just what we individual humans have access to it.

385
00:23:29.530 --> 00:23:30.880
Because see the whole thing.

386
00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:35.440
Then you'd probably find according to a theory called inflationary cosmology

387
00:23:35.441 --> 00:23:38.290
that we can discuss if you'd like, but according to this theory,

388
00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:42.880
the likely complexion of the universe is that there are a variety of bubbles,

389
00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.040
bubble universes.

390
00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:49.880
Ours is just one of this vast cosmic bubble bath of universes and in the

391
00:23:49.881 --> 00:23:50.900
different bubbles,

392
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:55.100
the laws of physics can appear to be somewhat different from the laws that we

393
00:23:55.101 --> 00:23:58.400
are familiar with. When you say the they can be different.

394
00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.710
So are you talking about Oh,

395
00:24:00.711 --> 00:24:03.890
hydrogen but no oxygen or are you talking about,

396
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:07.610
oh actually we don't have gravity here and we don't, we don't do gravity.

397
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:13.070
You know, they don't actually have a weak, for us it's more the former.

398
00:24:13.071 --> 00:24:18.071
But actually the distinction between those two examples is not as clear cut as

399
00:24:19.431 --> 00:24:21.770
you would envision. So for instance,

400
00:24:21.771 --> 00:24:25.070
if you talk about not having the nuclear forces,

401
00:24:25.071 --> 00:24:26.720
which is what you are alluding to,

402
00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:31.250
it's possible that the nuclear forces can be an our universe as we measure them

403
00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.730
and in that other bubble universe. But in the other bubble universe,

404
00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:39.940
they might be so weak compared to their strength in our universe that they don't

405
00:24:41.271 --> 00:24:42.470
have much of an impact.

406
00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:46.790
The impact might be infinite Tesla really small compared to the impact in our

407
00:24:46.791 --> 00:24:48.920
world. So for all intents and purposes,

408
00:24:48.921 --> 00:24:52.010
there might not be a nuclear force in that universe compared to the nuclear

409
00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:55.760
force an hours. Although this is getting a little complicated.

410
00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:57.640
So all right,

411
00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:02.000
we're here with a set of rules and a set of operating systems that we have

412
00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:04.400
somehow magnificently begun to figure out.

413
00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:09.500
And then you say they might be a neighbor where all of the principles that we,

414
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:13.760
that we that have organized life in existence here may not be operating quite

415
00:25:13.761 --> 00:25:14.594
the same way.

416
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:19.810
But I guess I kind of thought that we here eventually attached to them.

417
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.310
There are these bubbles you talk,

418
00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:26.450
these are different kind of bubble bubbles where we don't attach.

419
00:25:26.451 --> 00:25:30.440
So before when we were talking about the laws of physics here being the same as

420
00:25:30.441 --> 00:25:34.220
the laws of physics, way out where we can see and them beyond the horizon.

421
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:38.360
Think of that as taking place in one big bubble, right?

422
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:42.860
When we get to this be easy, ordinary, regular, ordinary. But,

423
00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:46.730
and the thing I really want to stress is these ideas do not come because we

424
00:25:46.731 --> 00:25:48.590
don't have enough to think about.

425
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:53.570
And the imagination runs wild when we study cosmological data.

426
00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.760
And again, I'd be happy to talk about the data,

427
00:25:55.761 --> 00:25:57.620
but I'm not sure how detailed we want to get.

428
00:25:57.621 --> 00:25:59.240
When we study the cosmological data,

429
00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:04.480
it leads us almost an extra bubbly to this picture where there are more than one

430
00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:09.380
bubble and these bubble universes are not talking to one another.

431
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.100
They're not touching each other. You can't reach the other bubble.

432
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:16.700
You can't traverse the space in between in a meaningful way.

433
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:21.500
So does that mean that over here, let's say we live here, so we have,

434
00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:26.630
I love this thing, so we are over here,

435
00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:27.913
so that's us.

436
00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:33.670
Now does something come out of this and do it again or does this happen?

437
00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.540
And then over there your guy happens.

438
00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:46.050
It's a little high being technical, technically accurate in these questions.

439
00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:48.490
That's like, well let me, let me just say another way of thinking about it that,

440
00:26:48.491 --> 00:26:48.791
that,

441
00:26:48.791 --> 00:26:51.900
that may help and then we can sort of come back to that if you think that will

442
00:26:51.901 --> 00:26:55.890
clarify things. Um, yeah.

443
00:26:56.010 --> 00:27:00.300
The way I thought I was startlingly clear myself. Yeah.

444
00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:04.140
The way I like to think about it is this picture, this inflationary picture,

445
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:08.340
it's as if the universe is a big block of Swiss cheese.

446
00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.030
And I'll just stop right there. Thank you. No,

447
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:17.660
it's like a big block of Swiss cheese where the holes are the universes that

448
00:27:17.911 --> 00:27:18.840
we're talking about.

449
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:23.490
So everything that we know about is one hole in the cosmic Swiss cheese.

450
00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.630
But there are many other holes in the cosmic Swiss cheese. And the point is,

451
00:27:27.631 --> 00:27:32.100
when we study this picture that emerges from studying the cosmological data,

452
00:27:32.130 --> 00:27:34.050
not from an overworked imagination,

453
00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:37.560
we find that the meaty part of the cheese,

454
00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:42.090
it's sort of a bad vegan man metaphor there, but you know the, um, the white,

455
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:47.120
the white part of the cheese expand so quickly that the bubbles,

456
00:27:47.221 --> 00:27:52.221
the holes in the cheese are pushed apart at an enormously fast rate,

457
00:27:52.591 --> 00:27:53.970
faster than the speed of light.

458
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:58.890
And that's what prevents one from even in principle, going from one hole,

459
00:27:58.891 --> 00:28:02.850
one bubble, our universe to another whole another bubble.

460
00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.610
So our universe and the other universe is,

461
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:09.450
they're all embedded in this environment. This cosmetics was cheese,

462
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:13.620
but we can't traverse the cheesy part because it's growing so enormously

463
00:28:13.621 --> 00:28:16.950
quickly. But oh dear, sweet. Now

464
00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:23.700
let's go with your metaphor here. So we have this big Swiss cheese of,

465
00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:28.750
of a mega something of the place versus is actually the way. Alright,

466
00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:33.000
so now I, we're inside, we're in space. So

467
00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:37.790
this is your cheese hole. Okay.

468
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:42.840
So I'm living in there, you know, and my universe is getting bigger and bigger.

469
00:28:42.841 --> 00:28:46.650
So this Swiss cheese has he a hole.

470
00:28:46.651 --> 00:28:47.950
That hole is growing.

471
00:28:48.490 --> 00:28:51.960
[inaudible] is growing and you're saying that the cheese but the right part of

472
00:28:51.961 --> 00:28:55.980
the cheese is also growing and it's growing faster than the rate of which that

473
00:28:56.370 --> 00:29:00.480
whole is growing. So there's bigger holes but more cheese.

474
00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:06.770
So if your in this particular thing,

475
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:10.500
it's brought to you by the American [inaudible] and we'll be doing it in

476
00:29:10.501 --> 00:29:11.490
Wisconsin next week.

477
00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:16.800
So the reason I can't talk to you,

478
00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:18.540
if you're in your hole and I'm mine,

479
00:29:18.541 --> 00:29:22.050
is I'm here growing your over there growing. But the space between us,

480
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.780
we would be flying to either side of this stage. Yes.

481
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:27.570
Faster than the speed of light. Yes. Fastening the speed of light.

482
00:29:27.571 --> 00:29:28.980
Sometimes people say, well, how's that possible?

483
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.960
And nothing goes faster than the speed of light.

484
00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:35.010
And the thing to remember is that when Einstein established that nothing goes

485
00:29:35.011 --> 00:29:36.270
faster than the speed of light,

486
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:41.480
but he really established is that nothing can traverse space at a speed greater

487
00:29:42.701 --> 00:29:43.720
than the speed of light.

488
00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:48.930
But as equations full well allows space itself to grow at any speed bigger than

489
00:29:49.991 --> 00:29:53.500
the speed of light is perfectly fine. Okay.

490
00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:56.320
I'm going to keep the keeps coming up because otherwise I'll get completely

491
00:29:56.321 --> 00:29:56.710
lost.

492
00:29:56.710 --> 00:30:01.710
So the universe then is a series of expanding empty spaces inside a web of some

493
00:30:04.751 --> 00:30:09.550
kinds, kind of, we'll call it the big cheese and uh, the, the webs are growing.

494
00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:15.060
What I don't still understand is where did these holes come from in Swiss

495
00:30:16.961 --> 00:30:19.270
cheese? I have no idea where those holes come from me.

496
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:25.090
I consider this the dual hole problem myself.

497
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.250
What could you address please?

498
00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:31.120
The spacial holes and believe the dairy holes for another occasion. Yeah. So,

499
00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:35.620
so in, in this version of cosmology, again, it's called inflationary cosmology.

500
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:38.020
What happens is in the beginning,

501
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:42.910
whenever that means spaces filled with something that we call a field,

502
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.130
an inflow Tom field as the name of it,

503
00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:48.910
and the field is very much like an electromagnetic field that think we're all

504
00:30:48.911 --> 00:30:52.930
pretty much familiar with that idea that there are electromagnetic waves going

505
00:30:52.931 --> 00:30:53.561
through this room.

506
00:30:53.561 --> 00:30:56.680
That's how you can use your cell phone to talk to somebody far away.

507
00:30:56.681 --> 00:30:59.230
The electromagnetic waves are suffusing space.

508
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.920
Those electromagnetic waves are fields, electromagnetic fields.

509
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:05.710
This inflationary theory invokes a new field,

510
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.530
not the electromagnetic field that fills all of space,

511
00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:12.610
and it has the amazing property that by virtue of filling space,

512
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:16.150
it causes space to be filled with repulsive gravity.

513
00:31:16.630 --> 00:31:20.620
That's what this field does. Repulsive gravity pushes everything apart.

514
00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:25.090
So this is gravity. Normal gravity brings things together.

515
00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:28.470
This is the ugly twin that's right out of my way, right?

516
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:31.750
And Einstein himself is the one who found this. This is an old idea.

517
00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:35.740
Repulsive gravity goes back to 1917 even though it's not widely appreciated,

518
00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.750
the gravity can be repulsive.

519
00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.580
And in this environment of this field filling space, gravity is repulsive,

520
00:31:42.581 --> 00:31:46.420
drives space apart. As space is driven apart.

521
00:31:46.421 --> 00:31:51.421
It turns out that there are regions where this field drops to zero value it.

522
00:31:52.391 --> 00:31:57.340
Quantum fluctuates to zero value, and those are the holes. So we,

523
00:31:57.341 --> 00:32:02.341
our universe is simply a fluctuation in this field where it had a high value and

524
00:32:04.031 --> 00:32:05.380
it dropped to a low value,

525
00:32:05.381 --> 00:32:09.700
thankfully then giving rise to the universe that we are familiar with and as,

526
00:32:09.701 --> 00:32:11.230
let me just close it. As it drops to zero,

527
00:32:11.231 --> 00:32:14.890
it gives up its energy to the familiar particles that make up you and me in the

528
00:32:14.891 --> 00:32:15.640
world.

529
00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.790
So all the particles that we know about and this version of cosmology come from

530
00:32:18.791 --> 00:32:21.100
this field dropping down to zero,

531
00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:26.080
releasing its energy to particles that give rise to the stuff that we are

532
00:32:26.081 --> 00:32:26.651
familiar with.

533
00:32:26.651 --> 00:32:31.450
Now that field can drop to zero all over the place giving rise to a bubble

534
00:32:31.451 --> 00:32:34.510
universe here, a bubble universe. They are a bubble universe there.

535
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:39.010
But in between the fields still has a finite value driving space to expand.

536
00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:42.170
Well, I understood about 5% of that, but,

537
00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:46.040
but maybe 10 so let me say it back to you and tell me how closely here.

538
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:50.990
So under epic, underneath everything,

539
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.950
there's this Whoa, whoa, Whoa, Whoa, whoa thing.

540
00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:58.850
Sometimes it gets hot, sometimes it gets cold, it's in flux anyway.

541
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:03.860
And sometimes it's, it's out this space, get out of my way and create space.

542
00:33:03.861 --> 00:33:04.970
And sometimes it just, I don't know,

543
00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:08.960
it goes home and has a sandwich or something. So, so sometimes you get

544
00:33:10.670 --> 00:33:12.290
an explosion of nothing,

545
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.890
which then melts down into us and sometimes you don't get very much at all.

546
00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.930
So you just, and there's this,

547
00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.070
this sort of thing underneath everything it's doing as long as by fingering

548
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:25.130
everything you mean the region of the universe in which this field has a

549
00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.520
repulsive gravity effect and drive space to expand.

550
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:33.260
So the cheesy parts of the Swiss cheese or the places where the field has a

551
00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:37.580
finite value and the holes in the Swiss cheese are where the field has dropped

552
00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:39.170
to zero value. Okay.

553
00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:45.050
So this leads me then infinity, I get on the universe side,

554
00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:46.370
we,

555
00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:51.230
what we end up with then is very distinctly different neighborhoods.

556
00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:54.050
Each of these bubbles can have its own character.

557
00:33:54.051 --> 00:33:59.051
So some of them you could have a Adams that come together happily and form

558
00:33:59.791 --> 00:34:03.800
chains and inform us and they even give rise to intelligent things and other

559
00:34:03.801 --> 00:34:07.490
things you just get like sand or I don't know.

560
00:34:07.491 --> 00:34:10.580
We really boring for us. Yup. Yup. Exactly.

561
00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:15.560
So then the universe is it. Got It. Is this an infinite universe?

562
00:34:15.561 --> 00:34:18.050
This is multi-variable that that's it. That's a good question.

563
00:34:18.051 --> 00:34:21.380
So there are a number of kinds of infinities that now come into the story.

564
00:34:21.381 --> 00:34:23.750
Number one, you can ask how many different bubbles are there,

565
00:34:23.751 --> 00:34:26.720
how many different holes in the cosmetics with cheese are there?

566
00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:31.130
And indeed this is a process that we believe to be eternal and therefore there

567
00:34:31.131 --> 00:34:34.130
would actually be an infinite number of these little bubbles with our bubble

568
00:34:34.131 --> 00:34:37.070
being just one. And now you might say, but wait a second,

569
00:34:37.071 --> 00:34:41.690
you started off this conversation talking about space that we have access to

570
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:46.550
going on infinitely far. If our universe is a bubble, no matter how big,

571
00:34:46.551 --> 00:34:49.460
it doesn't go on infinitely far, it has some size to it.

572
00:34:49.910 --> 00:34:54.910
And in a way that I urge you not to try to describe in any detail here because

573
00:34:56.151 --> 00:34:59.270
it's pretty tough to someone on the outside.

574
00:34:59.271 --> 00:35:03.950
It looks like this bubble has finite size to anybody on the inside.

575
00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.690
It looks like it has infinite size,

576
00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:10.640
so the conversation that we had 15 minutes ago about a universe that goes on

577
00:35:10.641 --> 00:35:14.840
forever applies here even to each of those individual bubbles.

578
00:35:14.841 --> 00:35:17.950
So in each bubble space goes on infinity.

579
00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.650
So there are an infinite number of copies of us having this conversation inside

580
00:35:21.651 --> 00:35:24.590
our inside a single one of these bubbles and then you've got infinite number of

581
00:35:24.591 --> 00:35:29.510
bubbles where anything else can be going on. Could there be,

582
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:33.080
and again again there's a danger, there's a danger that people say, oh my God,

583
00:35:33.081 --> 00:35:36.530
this is so far out and nuts. This is pretty far out. This is,

584
00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:38.130
this is a very minimal,

585
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:42.960
a very minimal approach to describing observations that we have.

586
00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.830
Observations of the cosmic microwave background, radiation,

587
00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:51.900
observations of the early universe by looking deeply into space can only be

588
00:35:51.901 --> 00:35:56.901
understood largely speaking in the context of the frameworks that we're

589
00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:01.110
discussing here. You're saying to me that all these muddy ideas come from very,

590
00:36:01.111 --> 00:36:04.020
very serious premises. Yes. They don't come from people saying,

591
00:36:04.021 --> 00:36:08.010
let's think of another, the idea and examine its consequences.

592
00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:09.540
They come from people saying,

593
00:36:09.690 --> 00:36:13.320
let's do measurements of the universe and try to come up with theories that

594
00:36:13.321 --> 00:36:15.180
explain those measurements.

595
00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:18.980
I'm not even gonna ask you what measurements those were. No,

596
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:21.300
literally that's not hard to describe.

597
00:36:21.301 --> 00:36:25.770
It's literally measurements of the temperature of radiation that we believe is

598
00:36:25.771 --> 00:36:28.860
leftover from the early stages of our bubble universe.

599
00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:30.540
You measured the temperature over there,

600
00:36:30.541 --> 00:36:34.380
the temperature over there and so forth and you get certain numbers and you try

601
00:36:34.381 --> 00:36:39.381
to explain them with theoretical equations and the framework that is able to

602
00:36:39.451 --> 00:36:44.100
best describe them winds up entailing all of the additional structure that we're

603
00:36:44.101 --> 00:36:47.190
talking about. It comes along with the theory.

604
00:36:47.191 --> 00:36:50.220
It's not something that you put in from the outside. Well,

605
00:36:50.221 --> 00:36:52.440
I want to get as weird as I know how to get here

606
00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.830
<v 0>based on what you've told me before. I, in addition,</v>

607
00:36:56.610 --> 00:37:01.230
imagining now the universe in which there's a bubble in which we have carbon and

608
00:37:01.231 --> 00:37:05.190
hydrogen and oxygen and all the forces that we're familiar with and we have

609
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:10.430
planets and mass and clouds of gas and you and me over and over and over again,

610
00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:11.693
that universe.

611
00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.580
And then we have another universe not too far over on that direction,

612
00:37:14.581 --> 00:37:16.170
which in which very little happens.

613
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:18.870
And another one in which we get halfway there. And another one,

614
00:37:18.871 --> 00:37:22.260
which is a very odd things happen. What about this?

615
00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:28.400
One of these bubble universes produces super intelligent computer geeks,

616
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:34.020
intelligent beings. And what they do is they do the matrix.

617
00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:37.350
They come up with a super computer,

618
00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.710
a fabulous supercomputer that creates a universe.

619
00:37:40.711 --> 00:37:45.711
So spectacularly realistic that the critters in that phony fake universe think

620
00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:49.560
there are a lot, if you can make,

621
00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:54.150
give me our universe and weird universes and weird or universes,

622
00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.940
can you eliminate the possibility of totally fake universe?

623
00:37:57.230 --> 00:38:00.430
<v 2>Not only can't you eliminate it, it's actually quite likely.</v>

624
00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:09.080
I mean you see in our universe just using that as a benchmark that we're getting

625
00:38:09.211 --> 00:38:12.840
closer and closer to being able to do exactly what you're talking about.

626
00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:18.030
Imagine technology a thousand or 10,000 years or a hundred thousand years down

627
00:38:18.031 --> 00:38:18.864
the road.

628
00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:23.930
One presumes that if progress continues a pace that we will be able to create

629
00:38:24.451 --> 00:38:25.800
the kind of simulations,

630
00:38:25.801 --> 00:38:30.801
computer simulations that to those bits that are being manipulated and that

631
00:38:31.861 --> 00:38:36.130
simulation appears to have a reality in much the same way that you're familiar

632
00:38:36.131 --> 00:38:40.450
from the matrix, you anticipate that that's likely to happen. In fact,

633
00:38:40.451 --> 00:38:44.080
you can go one step further just to what we make sure you show.

634
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:49.470
The people in this fictive universe would be creatures or fiction made up by a

635
00:38:50.681 --> 00:38:54.850
computer program, but the fiction would be so specific,

636
00:38:54.851 --> 00:38:58.210
so beautifully detailed that these creatures,

637
00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:03.540
fictional creatures in someone's mind to a computer would think they were alive,

638
00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:07.390
would think they fell in love with think that they were having sandwiches,

639
00:39:07.391 --> 00:39:11.140
would think they want it to be Vegas and sure,

640
00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:15.990
but bear in mind that it has nothing specific to do with any of the work that we

641
00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:19.510
physicists and string theorists and cosmologists are working on.

642
00:39:19.900 --> 00:39:24.760
I'm going to take that as a given that the natural progression of technology can

643
00:39:24.761 --> 00:39:27.160
lead to that kind of an outcome.

644
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:30.820
I have no particular expertise to say that that will happen,

645
00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:36.060
but a glance at the trajectory of technology suggests that that's a possibility.

646
00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:43.450
Now the place where the ideas that we're talking about come in is the following.

647
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:46.450
If you ask yourself the following question,

648
00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:52.140
is it more likely that if I'm a being that sees a reality,

649
00:39:52.930 --> 00:39:57.280
is it more likely that that's a real reality that came from the universe

650
00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:02.230
creating it and say one of these bubbles or is it more likely that I'm in a

651
00:40:02.231 --> 00:40:03.064
simulation

652
00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:09.250
and all we're talking about here leads to a rather interesting conclusion?

653
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:15.030
Because for the universe to create a reality that we're familiar with is a

654
00:40:15.281 --> 00:40:19.720
relatively unlikely course of events because the universe is creating all these

655
00:40:19.721 --> 00:40:22.690
bubbles. The particles are coming together in one way or another,

656
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:27.490
randomly joined together according to the laws of physics and only in some real

657
00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:32.491
tiny fraction will the configurations give rise to human beings say that see a

658
00:40:33.311 --> 00:40:36.580
world akin to the one that we see that's rare.

659
00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:41.890
In one of those bubbles though, if you do have these super intelligent beings,

660
00:40:41.891 --> 00:40:43.090
maybe they're not even super intelligent,

661
00:40:43.091 --> 00:40:46.450
just super expert at dealing with the technology of their time.

662
00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:49.270
If they can create simulated universes,

663
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:54.750
it's much more direct route to a reality that we would consider akin to what we

664
00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:01.030
experience is not random. It's individuals actually creating the simulation.

665
00:41:01.031 --> 00:41:04.720
In fact, they can create simulation after simulation after simulation,

666
00:41:04.721 --> 00:41:08.590
after simulation. So in that universe, there are many, many,

667
00:41:08.591 --> 00:41:13.120
many simulated worlds that beings in those worlds consider real.

668
00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:14.740
And therefore from that perspective,

669
00:41:14.741 --> 00:41:18.220
they're more simulated worlds that appear like the one that we see around us.

670
00:41:18.221 --> 00:41:21.490
Then there are real ones. Oh No.

671
00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:28.650
So the chances of us being in a naturally occurring real world might be smaller

672
00:41:30.881 --> 00:41:35.881
than the chances that we belong to the fifth grade project of a Geeky kid in the

673
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:38.063
planet Zan Tar

674
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:41.570
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

675
00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:46.570
<v 2>I don't know how you live with this stuff and we've only just sat down and</v>

676
00:41:46.851 --> 00:41:51.530
you've already told me that we are doppelganger it up the Gazoo.

677
00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:55.730
We therefore seem to have no real identity. Um,

678
00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:00.740
freewill is an open question and we're probably a fake.

679
00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:07.530
Why didn't you want to become like a soccer player or something were normal?

680
00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:12.760
[inaudible] oh, actually it's a serious question. I mean, do you actually,

681
00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:14.800
uh, do you actually

682
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:20.820
assuming that you believe these things to be true? Doesn't it get you down?

683
00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.160
No, I think it's incredibly exciting. I mean,

684
00:42:27.161 --> 00:42:32.161
to me the most wondrous thing about signs and physics in particular is the fact

685
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:36.910
that through the power of thought and calculation and observation,

686
00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:42.160
you can be led to conclusions vastly at odds with what you would think based

687
00:42:42.161 --> 00:42:43.150
upon experience.

688
00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:47.920
I don't think there's anything more wondrous in that moment when you think the

689
00:42:47.921 --> 00:42:51.910
world is one way and your equations, your math, your ideas,

690
00:42:51.911 --> 00:42:55.060
your theories begin to convince you that it is another way.

691
00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:58.330
And we've seen this played out in the history of science over and over again.

692
00:42:58.540 --> 00:42:58.941
I mean the,

693
00:42:58.941 --> 00:43:02.740
the gentleman developing quantum mechanics in the twenties and thirties from

694
00:43:02.741 --> 00:43:04.930
Heisenberg to board is Schrodinger and so forth.

695
00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:09.700
They began by thinking that the world was basically a Newtonian world,

696
00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:12.310
a clock work universe as it was called,

697
00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:16.510
where things evolve according to a very precise set of laws.

698
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:20.140
You tell me how things are today and the clockwork universe tells you how they

699
00:43:20.141 --> 00:43:25.030
will be tomorrow and in a generation they realized that that picture however

700
00:43:25.031 --> 00:43:26.200
compelling was wrong.

701
00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:31.300
They realize that the world arises and develops according to probabilistic

702
00:43:31.301 --> 00:43:32.050
rules.

703
00:43:32.050 --> 00:43:35.500
Where the best you can do is say it's a 30% chance that things will be this way

704
00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:38.980
in an hour, 4% chance of that and 22% of that.

705
00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:43.360
That was such a paradigm shaking way of thinking about reality.

706
00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.990
It's not something that gets you down. It's something that pumps you up.

707
00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:48.183
And if we,

708
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:53.170
and if we are now perhaps learning that the very nature of reality at least

709
00:43:53.171 --> 00:43:54.340
needs to be questioned,

710
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:59.140
it doesn't in any way stablish that we are in some simulation because it's more

711
00:43:59.141 --> 00:44:03.220
likely perhaps that we are in one. We could still be in a real universe.

712
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:07.810
But to me it's wonderful to get your sense of reality kicked to get a kick in

713
00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:12.670
the head and to at least be able to contemplate the real possibility that the

714
00:44:12.671 --> 00:44:16.840
laws of physics are suggesting that reality is not what you think it is.

715
00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:21.760
Although if you're seeking to be pleased by what you see,

716
00:44:21.761 --> 00:44:26.600
if you want to feel joy, but I'll give you a joyous image. If,

717
00:44:27.810 --> 00:44:32.010
if I shoot a cannon ball into the air, Newton and wolf physicists can

718
00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:35.640
<v 0>tell me if they knew enough exactly where the cannon ball is going to go.</v>

719
00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:38.280
And it's fixed and it's understood.

720
00:44:38.281 --> 00:44:40.320
And there the Cannibal has no freewill in this matter.

721
00:44:40.321 --> 00:44:43.710
If you know what the image I like to think is, if I were,

722
00:44:43.711 --> 00:44:45.510
if I took a dead bird and threw it in the air,

723
00:44:45.511 --> 00:44:50.130
it would fall predictably to a place on the ground. But if I took a live bird,

724
00:44:51.020 --> 00:44:51.290
<v 1>yeah.</v>

725
00:44:51.290 --> 00:44:52.670
<v 0>And threw it up in the air,</v>

726
00:44:54.850 --> 00:44:58.510
<v 2>I could in principle predict where it will land. Oh,</v>

727
00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:01.150
but you'd have to know so much. I need to know so much,

728
00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:05.440
but that's a fine detail. That's the fine print you, you,

729
00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:09.670
I think have in mind that the bird has some freewill to go where it wants you to

730
00:45:09.671 --> 00:45:14.290
go. And uh, as far as, as I certainly can tell,

731
00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:19.620
there is no place for free will in our understanding of the laws of physics.

732
00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:24.490
However, diminishing that may make some people feel,

733
00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:29.730
I think we need to perhaps face up to the real possibility that the notion of

734
00:45:29.921 --> 00:45:33.220
having free will is an illusion. It's a useful illusion.

735
00:45:33.221 --> 00:45:37.750
It makes life interesting and it's one that you need to put to the side because

736
00:45:37.751 --> 00:45:40.480
you need to live as though you do have free will.

737
00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:43.630
But all there is is physics.

738
00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:52.900
<v 0>Um, don't you have, there are a lot of people, uh, Paul Steinhardt, David Gross,</v>

739
00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:56.530
Martin Garden who have some real problems with this multi-verse concept and I'm

740
00:45:56.531 --> 00:45:59.350
just to run a few of them by you. One of them is

741
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:06.030
to conjure up a universe in which everything that could happen is happening,

742
00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:10.540
you know, so there are lots of Brians in Robertson,

743
00:46:10.541 --> 00:46:12.510
there were lots of almost Brian's in Robertson,

744
00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:16.360
lots of very almost imposed almost in all this kind of thing. Um,

745
00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:20.920
doesn't that break one of the basic rules of science that you to keep it simple

746
00:46:20.921 --> 00:46:24.430
rule outcomes raiser? I mean, if you can, I'll just quote Martin Gardner.

747
00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:29.050
Surely the conjecture that there's just one universe in its creator is

748
00:46:29.051 --> 00:46:33.310
infinitely simpler and easier to believe that there are countless billions upon

749
00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:34.240
billions of worlds.

750
00:46:36.850 --> 00:46:39.250
<v 2>It does sound simpler in some ways and I have to say,</v>

751
00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:41.110
I'm going to give you two answers to this issue.

752
00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:46.770
If it turns out that our future understanding eliminates this idea of parallel

753
00:46:48.581 --> 00:46:49.414
universes,

754
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:53.050
multi-verse theory and winds up showing us the way to think about is this,

755
00:46:53.051 --> 00:46:55.060
there's one universe we can calculate everything.

756
00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:57.340
It's uniquely determined by the laws of physics.

757
00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.310
I think I'd be happier with that outcome,

758
00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:05.550
so don't get the misunderstanding that I have some emotional connection to this

759
00:47:06.311 --> 00:47:07.090
idea.

760
00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:10.770
It's where we're naturally led by a variety of interesting ideas and therefore

761
00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:12.250
needs to be taken seriously.

762
00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:17.460
But in terms of it being simpler to have one universe versus many,

763
00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:21.190
it really depends on how you define simpler, right?

764
00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:26.370
Is it simpler to have one number versus many or all numbers?

765
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:31.150
In fact, if I give you a 22 digit number,

766
00:47:31.151 --> 00:47:32.980
just one 22 digit number,

767
00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:37.540
and I ask you to repeat it to me versus I simply say,

768
00:47:37.541 --> 00:47:40.060
think of all numbers and just count them off for me.

769
00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:43.840
Which tasks do you think you will succeed at? Oh, come on,

770
00:47:43.841 --> 00:47:46.420
you make 22 how about working this way? No, no, no.

771
00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:51.190
Give me a two digit number or give me a, but that's the thing.

772
00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:54.190
Our universe is not characterized by a two digit number.

773
00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:59.490
Our University is characterized by a great number of distinct features.

774
00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:03.400
The mass of the electron, the mass of the Cork, this strength of gravity,

775
00:48:03.401 --> 00:48:05.320
the strength of the electromagnetic force.

776
00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.900
They gauge symmetry of the standard model,

777
00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:10.480
the equations of general relativity and on and on.

778
00:48:10.481 --> 00:48:15.481
It goes a long list of ingredients that need to be just so for the universe as

779
00:48:17.591 --> 00:48:18.760
we know it to appear.

780
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:22.780
You get the massive electron a little bit wrong when you repeat it. To me,

781
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:24.220
the world is different.

782
00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:27.460
You get the strength of gravity a little bit off when you repeat it. To me,

783
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:31.690
the world is completely different. So there really is a tight analogy.

784
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:34.960
There's a long number if you will,

785
00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:40.020
that characterizes this data versus their being all universes versus there being

786
00:48:41.831 --> 00:48:46.831
all numbers and in some sense it's much easier from a complexity standpoint to

787
00:48:48.191 --> 00:48:53.191
describe all numbers than it is to describe this one particular 22 or 44 digit

788
00:48:53.291 --> 00:48:54.400
number. In fact,

789
00:48:54.401 --> 00:48:57.400
you can make this precise as a notion of algorithmic complexity,

790
00:48:57.610 --> 00:49:02.610
which is the amount of information necessary to say give to a computer to spit

791
00:49:03.131 --> 00:49:05.710
back a piece of data that you're interested in.

792
00:49:06.220 --> 00:49:10.390
Now I can write a very short computer program that will spit out one, two three,

793
00:49:10.391 --> 00:49:12.760
four, five, six at one line computer code.

794
00:49:13.090 --> 00:49:16.000
If I want to spit out some particular number,

795
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:20.350
well I may need to actually type in every single digit of that number for it to

796
00:49:20.351 --> 00:49:24.550
spit it back to me. That has greater complexity, not less complexity.

797
00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:28.270
And I'm only trying to emphasize the fact that even though you think of one

798
00:49:28.271 --> 00:49:30.070
universe as being more simple than many,

799
00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:33.820
that reasoning need not actually hold up under close scrutiny.

800
00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:38.410
So just so I give you your due, you are saying that,

801
00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.710
and I'm not even gonna ask you what the problems are,

802
00:49:41.711 --> 00:49:46.540
but serious people trying to figure out things that they can measure and things

803
00:49:46.541 --> 00:49:51.541
that they can see and things that they can examine when they look to the math

804
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:56.830
because I looked behind the math leads them to these two,

805
00:49:56.831 --> 00:50:00.820
this multiple universe concerts directly or over and over and for many,

806
00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:04.330
many different directions from classical physics, from quantum physics.

807
00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:07.060
There are a variety of different ways of having multiple universes.

808
00:50:07.061 --> 00:50:10.090
We've actually described to tonight the idea that if he goes sufficiently far

809
00:50:10.091 --> 00:50:13.420
out, the universe repeats as if there are many worlds out there,

810
00:50:13.421 --> 00:50:17.290
much like ours or there can be these many bubbles where there are many universe

811
00:50:17.291 --> 00:50:19.420
out there that may be like ours or not,

812
00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:24.810
and these are naturally coming from simple ideas that we allow to run their

813
00:50:24.881 --> 00:50:29.270
course. I should emphasize this is not a certainty by any means.

814
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:30.590
Physics, science,

815
00:50:30.591 --> 00:50:35.360
we all know is that dynamic subject where new ideas come in and force us to

816
00:50:35.361 --> 00:50:37.400
reevaluate and to rethink things.

817
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:42.670
And I would be thrilled if ultimately we do find that there's one unique

818
00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:46.670
university we can sit down and calculate everything about it that would be

819
00:50:46.671 --> 00:50:47.504
thrilling.

820
00:50:47.990 --> 00:50:51.890
But it's also thrilling to imagine that that isn't how the world is really put

821
00:50:51.891 --> 00:50:55.610
together and that the data that we now have and the ideas that we're coming up

822
00:50:55.611 --> 00:50:59.990
with may be revealing the true underlying reality.

823
00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:05.180
All right, so, so we were left with a bunch of choices. We are,

824
00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:09.170
uh, infinitely duplicatable.

825
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:13.160
We live in cheese and expanding holes.

826
00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:18.740
He, we might be a reflection of a computer.

827
00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:21.620
We might be a pale reflection of mathematics.

828
00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:26.860
We might be actually made of real stuff in the here and now or not.
