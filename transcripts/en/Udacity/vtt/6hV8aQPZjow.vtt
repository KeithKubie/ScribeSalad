00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.130
So my name is Nikolas Blanchet, I'm thirty

00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:04.550
one years old. I currently live in San Francisco,

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.790
California though I have lived all over the

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.086
United States, and I am di, have been diagnosed

00:00:09.086 --> 00:00:11.910
with Bipolar II Disorder. Bipolar II Disorder is

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.784
characterized by long periods of depression like symptoms. so

00:00:16.784 --> 00:00:21.350
lethargy, lack of motivation, lack of ambition. periods that,

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.450
periods of hopelessness, periods of sadness, although not everyone

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.558
had, experiences it in the same way. in addition to that, Bipolar II

00:00:30.558 --> 00:00:32.200
has a fun little twist, where you've

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.120
also got periods of what's called Hypomania.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.195
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:38.550
&gt;&gt; Hypomania is like a less extreme form of

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.004
mania. Mania being, where you have a complete break

00:00:42.004 --> 00:00:46.958
from reality, and you are hyper-energetic, hyper-optimistic. you usually

00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:50.450
take a lot of risky behavior. For example sort of

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.450
the characteristic that my doctor always tells me

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.820
to watch out for is, give me a call

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.550
if you decided that you're going to Vegas, and

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.090
going to buy a yacht for the weekend, because

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.550
it might seem like a lot of fun, so bring me in on the fun. Hypomania in

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.960
my case, manifested as periods of extreme sociability hypersexuality

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.560
extreme productivity at work, and less sleep than normal.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.584
Also, with Bipolar II disorder, the hypomanic periods

00:01:18.584 --> 00:01:20.670
are rare. So one to two time a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.566
year, and fairly brief. somewhere between three and

00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:27.570
seven days, which is very different than standard mania.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.200
&gt;&gt; I see. And when were you diagnosed?

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.510
&gt;&gt; I was diagnosed Bipolar II Disorder in November of 2012.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.340
&gt;&gt; Okay, so you've only known then for a little bit of time.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.840
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.350
&gt;&gt; And how, how's that affected you? How did,

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.320
how, how did that come about?

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.130
&gt;&gt; So I had been diagnosed with depression for, and this is apparently, by the

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.470
way, a very typical story. I had been

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.420
tia, diagnosed with depression for about five years.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.560
I was going to a psychiatrist and a

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.580
psychologist regularly. and they would prescribe various antidepressants,

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.120
none of which would work. And in fact,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.570
my symptoms over time gradually but, but noticeably,

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.610
trended worse and worse and worse. after I

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.380
moved to the Bay area my psychiatrist that I

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.540
got out here, pointed out that I might

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.890
actually not be responding well to the medication, because

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.490
it was treating something that I didn't have.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.880
And, instead, he su, suggested that I switch to

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.980
mood stabilizers. Well, the confirming fact came after I

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.760
was taking a very high dosage of an antidepressant,

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.360
and through the end of November and through most December, I had a very,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.830
very bad period of depression. I had

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.430
no motivation to do anything, I stopped going

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.390
to work, it was pretty bad. And then when I went back in and saw

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.520
him again, he prescribed a, what's called

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.820
a mood stabilizer, which is different than antidepressant.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.890
&gt;&gt; Well, that leads me to another

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.360
question about sort of advantages, and disadvantages here.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.190
You've touched on them briefly, but from your

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.040
own perspective, I mean, are there any advantages

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.600
to being or having showing symptoms of bipolar

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.090
and, and, and I'm also curious in the disadvantages.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.710
&gt;&gt; So, the advantages. I've never really thought of it that

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.312
way. one thing they don't tell you, is that hypomania is awesome.

00:03:09.312 --> 00:03:09.942
[LAUGH]

00:03:09.942 --> 00:03:10.942
&gt;&gt;

00:03:09.942 --> 00:03:10.584
[LAUGH]

00:03:10.584 --> 00:03:13.830
&gt;&gt; It feels really good. you're, you're an animal in

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.160
bed, you are hyperproductive at work. You have a lot of

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.320
energy. You are really social. You're really charming. You're really dynamic.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.440
you can be a little bit more risky with your behavior,

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.460
but not so much so that people around you are like

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.310
scared for you. So, people just think, wow Nick's really on

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.470
par this week. You basically feel like you are king of

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.400
the world, for a period of time. The disadvantages are obviously,

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.000
work disruption. Right? So, that's the biggest one. With me

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.690
these long drawn out periods of silence. And you know as

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.100
a, as a friend of mine, like I would go

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.670
through periods where no one would hear from Nick. Where is

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.300
Nick? I would just disappear, because keeping up appearances and

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.840
and making sure that people around me are comfortable and having

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.960
a good time, is important to me. And so when

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.050
I was in a bad place, I instead of like being

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:04.410
the negative guy around everyone all the time, I just sort

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.680
of removed myself from the situation. And, of course, there's social

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.080
stigma and stuff attached with it, too, which makes it complicated.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.660
It makes it difficult to have relationships. It makes it difficult to

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.730
stick to tasks. I stopped and started college a, a number

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.829
of times, and looking back, it probably had a lot to

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.930
do with this. I don't want to blame this for all

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.940
of my problems. Right? I still have good days and bad days,

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.500
I'm still mortal, I still make mistakes. But I suppose

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.010
now that I think about it, another advantage of Bipolar

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.900
Disorder, and having had it diagnosed, is I get insight.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.130
I know a little bit more about why things happen,

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.200
why am I this way, why. Why? It gives context.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.080
It doesn't excuse things. I still things that I need

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.510
to work on. But it gives a little context about

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.990
what my struggles might be, about the things that I need

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.570
to watch out for. It also makes

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.850
sure that I exercise, because that's very helpful.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.909
&gt;&gt; How do other people perceive you as someone who is

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:03.560
Bipolar? What's the general reaction? How, how is it perceived by

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.530
others, both strangers, just say, the general public, but also your

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:12.110
friends. Have they responded and, and what's your reaction to their reactions?

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.740
&gt;&gt; When people who I know, and have known for

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.670
a period of time, find out that I'm Bipolar, I

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.970
tend to get one of two reactions. One is generally

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.680
supportive. And saying oh, well, I'm glad you're just getting this

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.780
managed, I'm glad you've got some stuff. And the other one's

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.290
sort of like a duh, I could have told you that!

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.428
Not because it manifested, because, but because you know, their because

00:05:33.428 --> 00:05:36.129
they have noticed these trends that I have. And they knew

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:38.808
that there was something up, but they never knew what it

00:05:38.808 --> 00:05:42.820
was. And so, okay, this makes sense that you've got this.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.190
&gt;&gt; We're curious in knowing, what is your family history of Bipolar,

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.810
and any other mental health condition that you think might be related.

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.450
&gt;&gt; So, my Mom, my Mom was diagnosed with Bipolar II

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.710
Disorder and she's, she was actually on the same medication that

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.770
I am on now, for a while, but she never told

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.980
me this. My sister one of my younger sisters suffers from depression.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.880
my Dad is the, actually, on that side of the family, he is the most ADD

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.390
person I have ever met in my entire

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:15.440
life. Like, you know the Wikipedia hole, where

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.090
you just keep clicking on hyperlink, after hyperlink,

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.870
after hyperlink, until you've got a million tabs

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.143
open? Yeah, like he can't use Wikipedia because

00:06:23.143 --> 00:06:25.900
it's paralyzing. His, his weekend will be gone.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.640
&gt;&gt; What do you think about the portrayal of

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.010
mental health in general, both in the media, and

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.020
in society at large? How we deal with it as a

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:40.060
population? Do you think we take mental health seriously? Do you think

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:43.600
it's portrayed in a meaningful way that gets the right kind of

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.410
attention, or do you think we still have some work to do?

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.840
&gt;&gt; I definitely believe that in the area of portrayal of mental health well,

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.130
in the area of how the average person thinks of mental health, we have

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:03.120
some work to do. Because it's one, it's, it's easy to look at someone and

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.330
say, you have a broken leg. You have a scratch. You've been burned. But when it

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:12.200
permeates the mind. When it permeates the thing

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.510
that's sitting behind the eyes, and looking back

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:23.760
at you. It's hard to say, well you're an asshole versus you have an issue. And,

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.080
because it's so difficult to recognize in the first

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:32.600
place, we tend to overlook it, minimize it, and,

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:38.200
and not give it the type of treatment that we should. If I had to have

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.840
a message for somebody who's Bipolar II I

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:47.020
would definitely say, seek medical assistance. this is

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.310
something that responds very well to treatment. And

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:53.560
once you've gotten that proper treatment, once you've

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.040
been able to help yourself out, then you

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.480
can live a very, very satisfying and happy life.
