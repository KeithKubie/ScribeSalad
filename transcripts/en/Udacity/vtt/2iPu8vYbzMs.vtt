00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.424
We know that this distance here is this distance on the number line. So if we

00:00:04.424 --> 00:00:08.288
go all the way to x2 and subtract off x1, we'll be left with the part in

00:00:08.288 --> 00:00:14.026
between them. For the vertical distance this part we want to look at the y

00:00:14.026 --> 00:00:19.280
values. We start at y1 and then we climb all the way up to y2. So if we want to

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.155
find this vertical distance, we really want to find this vertical distance on

00:00:24.155 --> 00:00:31.676
the number line. So, we'll go all the way up to y2, and we'll subtract off y1.

00:00:31.676 --> 00:00:37.298
This will leave us with just this distance here. So, this is how we know that

00:00:37.298 --> 00:00:42.034
the horizontal distance is x2 minus x1, and the vertical distance is y2 minus

00:00:42.034 --> 00:00:43.852
y1.
