Today on Dnews, we answer one of life’s
greatest mysteries: why do people go bald?

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:16.360
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and something
I guarantee every man watching this has thought

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.519
at one point or another - is, am I losing
my hair?

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.369
Which is totally understandable.

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.390
Over a third of all men in America suffer
from hair loss, but why is that?

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.789
What causes someone to go bald - and is there
an evolutionary reason for why it happens?

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.410
Well, male pattern baldness is essentially
a product of two factors: genetics and hormones.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.269
On the hormone side, you have testosterone
- over time, about 5% of all your testosterone

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.570
breaks down and gets converted into di-hydro-testosterone
- DHT.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.579
All men have some amount of DHT in their bodies,
from the moment an egg gets fertilized, until

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.579
they die.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.010
And it does different things depending on
what stage of life you’re in.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.100
When you’re still in the womb, DHT is what
helps form the male genitalia.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.010
But once a man reaches adulthood, it starts
to play a role in prostate regulation, and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.070
it can cause the hair follicles to miniaturize.

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.460
So men who experience male pattern baldness,
likely have a sensitivity to DHT.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.790
That’s the hormone explanation.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.980
But most baldness, especially baldness that
happens early on in life - is due to genetics.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.580
And we’ve always been taught that it’s
a maternal disorder, right?

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.880
So if you’re a guy, and your mom’s father
was bald - then you’ll be bald too.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:23.920
And sometimes, that is the case.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.220
But not always.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.820
Recent research has shown that it’s likely
a result of multiple genes, from both your

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.350
mother and your father.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.270
But just because they lost their hair quickly,
doesn’t necessarily mean you will.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.780
You also have to account for things like stress,
medications, diet, smoking, and sleeping habits

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.540
- all of which can contribute to hair loss.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.570
Interestingly, the fact that there is some
genetic basis for it, does imply that it provides

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.580
at least some evolutionary advantage.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.010
The current leading theory is that baldness
is a sign of physical and social maturity,

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.811
which indicates that he’s past the stage
of high sexual activity, and thus less of

00:01:57.811 --> 00:01:59.150
a threat to other males.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.490
It also stands to reason that a mature man
would be more nurturing to younger groups

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.220
- which in turn, would be a selling point
for women.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.230
Not to mention the fact that he’d be less
likely to seek out other women, and vice versa.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:14.200
It makes sense when you think about it, but
most guys would probably still prefer to have

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.200
their hair back.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.100
And unfortunately, once you go bald, the only
surefire way to do that - is a hair transplant.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.230
Which isn’t cheap.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.830
But hey - at least it’s your own hair.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.350
What do you guys think about this?

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.210
And if you are bald, do you embrace it - or
try to hide it?

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.410
