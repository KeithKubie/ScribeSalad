00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.000
In today's video,

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.460
we're showing you a simple recipe
to make your own air dry clay.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.500
It only has a couple of ingredients.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.300
You can easily change the colors
using food coloring,

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.420
and you can sand it and
paint it beautifully.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.600

[Music]

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.980
[Music]

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.539
To get started, of course,

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.070
we'll need a bag of baking soda,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.300
and some corn starch.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.500
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.780
You cook baking soda, cornstarch,
and water on the stove for a few minutes,

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.740
and it turns into a soft clay.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.200
That clay can be dyed with food coloring,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.680
and shaped into whatever you want.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.120
Let it sit out for a couple days,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.040
and it will dry completely hard.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.600
Let's start out with 1/2
of a cup of corn starch.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.280
[Music]

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.719
After half a cup of corn starch,

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.960
we need one full cup of baking soda.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.400
[Music]

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.340
Now, to finish this off,
we need 3/4 cups of cold water.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.780
[Music]

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.050
Now, without putting it on the stove yet,

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.480
stir this all together until it's
one smooth consistency.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.200
I think we've probably
all seen what happens

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.059
when we mix water with cornstarch,

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.160
and so it's going to be
a little lumpy at first.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.520
[Music]

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.579
After your mixture is all smooth,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.840
it's time to throw it on the
stove at medium heat.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.680
They ask you how you are,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.200
you just have to say that you're fine,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.640
and you're not really fine.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:24.399
[Music]

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.340
After a few minutes of stirring,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.639
your mixture will get to something that
looks almost completely indistinguishable

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.980
from mashed potatoes.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.720
Transfer it to a heat safe surface
to let it cool down.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.480
While you're letting it cool down,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.320
cover it with a wet paper towel.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.980
This clay dries out,

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.040
and that makes it hard and unworkable,

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.700
and you don't want it to dry out
before you get a chance to sculpt it.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.960
After our clay has cooled off,

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.620
we now have something that
can easily be sculpted,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.859
molded, shaped and colored.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.860
This really does look a lot
like mashed potatoes.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.200
It doesn't smell like mashed
potatoes of course.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.640
Mostly, it smells like the corn starch.

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.719
It doesn't have as much of
the baking soda smell.

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.480
I think corn starts just has
a stronger smell in general.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.460
[Music]

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.660
It's non-toxic.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.780
It's not going to do anything to you.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.439
It's just baking soda and cornstarch,

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.440
but it's bad.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.660
Let's try adding a little bit of
color to some of our clay.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.880
Just one drop of yellow.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:31.880
[Music]

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.460
There we go.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.040
I'm really just going to run
with that mashed potatoes look,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.840
and this little pad of butter.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:52.140
[Music]

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.480
Gently mixing a couple of colors together
can give you a cool marbled effect.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.160
If you're trying to make larger
pieces out of clay,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.700
it can crack a little bit as
it dries if it's too thick.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.940
So, I recommend using
some foil as a base shape,

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.980
and then, sculpting the clay around that.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:35.880
[Music]

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.660
Let's see if we can't use this clay
to try and make a casting.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:04:04.360
[Music]

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.780
It's been a few days and our baking soda
cornstarch clay has had time to dry.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:10.440
Let's see how things turned out.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.320
[Music]

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.540
Our Lego brick molded fairly well,

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.280
but it did curve a little
bit as it was curing,

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.640
so, I'm not sure if we'd be able to get
that to clip onto a real Lego brick or not.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.700
Let's give it a test.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.420
That's a, slightly attached right there.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.720
The curve I think is going to make it

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.260
have a harder time
attaching to an entire brick.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.820
This clay does shrink a
tiny bit as it dries,

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.100
so it's not quite the same
shape as it was before.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.640
[Music]

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.400
It It has some grip though.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.660
It's kind of like knockoff brand Lego,

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.360
just not as good.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.260
Doesn't fit quite as well.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.180
See how R2D2 is doing.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.500
[Music]

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.419
Ooh! R2D2 turned out great.

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.680
This silicone mold is meant for
making R2D2 shaped ice cubes.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.000
We've made a nice little
plastic-like figure instead.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.340
Picked up some really
good details in there as well.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.560
Again, these are molds
designed for making ice cubes.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.980
These ones are of course shaped
like little Lego figures,

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.860
and again, did a good job getting the details.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.500
It's a, it's a pretty good casting right there.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.740
Tool holder for my individual drill bits.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.660
[Music]

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:33.980
Let's try sanding this clay,

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.060
and see how well that works.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.879
[Music]

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.440
It sands really nicely.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.080
Very smooth grain,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.700
takes it down pretty fast.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.340
[Music]

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.340
That gets pretty nice and smooth.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.960
So, sandpaper does
a very good job with this.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.960
Now, this piece,

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.699
I actually just made to
do a strength test.

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:55.640
So, I'm going to see how
easily it can break this.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.520
[Music]

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:01.640
It's harder than a cookie.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.120
I would say that
it's decently hard to snap.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.440
Something like this would,

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.199
I'd say you can count on
that to be durable,

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:13.050
unless you're deliberately
trying to break it,

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.830
even dropping it a little bit,

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.020
don't really have to worry
too much about it.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.480
It's not super fragile.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.480
One final test,

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.120
let's see how well this stuff takes paint.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.949
We're going to hit with
layer of spray paint,

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:24.480
and see if it takes the color nicely.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.180
[Music]

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.979
I would say that the paint
worked pretty well.

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:32.471
I only did a couple of layers of it,

00:06:32.471 --> 00:06:33.930
and it's nice and covered.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.400
It really does a good job of going on top
of the color of clay you already have.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.020
If it's already starting with white,

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.360
I'm sure you can get even better
coverage than if you're trying to

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.300
go over a contrasting color.

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.020
Baking soda, cornstarch, and water,

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.020
It's easy to make.

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.020
Only takes a few minutes.

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.630
You can add colors with food coloring.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.000
You can add colors with paint.

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.140
It's pretty durable.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.520
It sands really well.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.740
You can make decorative pieces.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.120
You can make useful pieces.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.720
This stuff is pretty neat all around.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.960
Guys, the fun doesn't have to end.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.620
That box up at the top will transport
you directly to our last video,

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.630
and you should go check that out.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.290
The box at the bottom will show you what 
YouTube thinks you need to be watching next,

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.379
and this bomb in the middle
will subscribe to the channel,

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.720
so you never miss out on a video.

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.740
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.920
and we'll see you in the next one.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.640
Talk to you then.
