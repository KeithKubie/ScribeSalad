00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.982
- [Voiceover] Let's say
that we have the equation

00:00:01.982 --> 00:00:06.841
six plus three w is equal to

00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:11.822
the square root of two w plus 12

00:00:11.822 --> 00:00:14.207
plus two w.

00:00:14.207 --> 00:00:17.648
See if you can pause the
video and solve for w,

00:00:17.648 --> 00:00:19.248
and it might have more than one solution,

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:20.877
so keep that in mind.

00:00:20.877 --> 00:00:22.779
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:23.836
So the first thing I'd like to do

00:00:23.836 --> 00:00:25.274
whenever I see one of
these radical equations

00:00:25.274 --> 00:00:28.112
is just isolate the radical
on one side of the equation.

00:00:28.112 --> 00:00:31.492
So let's subtract two w from both sides.

00:00:31.492 --> 00:00:33.696
I want to get rid of that two
w from the right-hand side.

00:00:33.696 --> 00:00:35.266
I just want the radical sign.

00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:38.133
And if I subtract two w from both sides,

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.552
what am I left with?

00:00:39.552 --> 00:00:42.276
Well, on the left-hand
side, I am left with

00:00:42.276 --> 00:00:45.343
six plus three w minus two w.

00:00:45.343 --> 00:00:47.300
Well, three of something
take away two of 'em,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.910
you're going to be left with w.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.144
Six plus w is equal to,

00:00:51.144 --> 00:00:52.955
these cancel out, we're left with

00:00:52.955 --> 00:00:57.242
the square root of two w plus 12.

00:00:57.242 --> 00:00:58.660
And to get rid of the radical,

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.743
we're going to square both sides,

00:01:00.743 --> 00:01:03.158
and we've seen before that
this process right over here,

00:01:03.158 --> 00:01:04.063
it's a little bit tricky,

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:04.949
because when you're squaring a radical

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.911
in a radical equation like this,

00:01:06.911 --> 00:01:11.016
and then you solve, you might
find an extraneous solution.

00:01:11.016 --> 00:01:12.133
What do I mean by that?

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:13.370
Well, we're going to get the same result

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.068
whether we square this or
whether we square that,

00:01:16.068 --> 00:01:18.454
because when you square a
negative, it becomes a positive.

00:01:18.454 --> 00:01:21.080
But those are fundamentally
two different equations.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.800
We only want the solutions that satisfy

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.672
the one that doesn't
have the negative there.

00:01:24.672 --> 00:01:26.181
So that's why we're going
to test our solutions

00:01:26.181 --> 00:01:29.260
to make sure they're valid
for our original equation.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:31.041
So, if we square both sides,

00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:34.995
on the left-hand side,
we're going to have,

00:01:34.995 --> 00:01:37.319
well, it's gonna be w squared

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.459
plus two times their product.

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:43.603
So, two times six times w, so that's 12 w,

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:46.476
plus six squared, 36,

00:01:46.476 --> 00:01:50.159
Is equal to, now, if
you take the square root

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.962
and square it, you're going to
be left with two plus twelve.

00:01:53.962 --> 00:01:58.429
Now, we can subtract two
w and 12 from both sides,

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:59.648
so let's do that.

00:01:59.648 --> 00:02:02.385
So then we can get it into
a standard quadratic form.

00:02:02.385 --> 00:02:05.827
So let's subtract two w from both sides

00:02:05.827 --> 00:02:09.479
and let's subtract 12 from both sides.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.562
So, subtract 12 from the right.

00:02:11.562 --> 00:02:12.558
Subtract 12 here.

00:02:12.558 --> 00:02:13.795
And once again, I just
want to get rid of this

00:02:13.795 --> 00:02:15.104
on the right-hand side,

00:02:15.104 --> 00:02:17.670
and I'm going to be left with,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.266
I am going to be left with,

00:02:20.266 --> 00:02:22.259
on the left-hand side, it's gonna be

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:23.677
w squared.

00:02:23.677 --> 00:02:27.300
See, 12 w minus two w is plus ten w,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.700
and then 36 minus twelve is plus 24,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.112
is equal to zero.

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:35.440
Now, let's see, to solve this,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.427
let's see, is this factorable?

00:02:36.427 --> 00:02:38.892
Are there two numbers that up to ten

00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:40.734
and whose product is 24?

00:02:40.734 --> 00:02:43.299
What jumps out at me is six and four.

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.318
So we can rewrite this as w plus four

00:02:46.318 --> 00:02:50.393
times w plus six is equal to zero.

00:02:50.393 --> 00:02:52.476
And so, if I have the
product of two things

00:02:52.476 --> 00:02:53.713
equaling zero,

00:02:53.713 --> 00:02:55.856
well to solve this,
either one or both of them

00:02:55.856 --> 00:02:56.732
could be equal zero.

00:02:56.732 --> 00:02:58.301
Zero times anything is gonna be zero.

00:02:58.301 --> 00:03:01.848
So, w plus four is equal to zero,

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:05.572
or w plus six is equal to zero.

00:03:05.572 --> 00:03:07.835
And over here, if you
subtract four from both sides,

00:03:07.835 --> 00:03:10.401
you get w is equal to negative four.

00:03:10.401 --> 00:03:12.811
Or, subtract six from both sides here.

00:03:12.811 --> 00:03:14.678
w is equal to negative six.

00:03:14.678 --> 00:03:17.847
Now let's verify that these
actually are solutions

00:03:17.847 --> 00:03:18.873
to our original equation.

00:03:18.873 --> 00:03:20.141
Remember, our original equation was six.

00:03:20.141 --> 00:03:22.073
I'll rewrite it here.

00:03:22.073 --> 00:03:25.001
Our original equation was six plus three w

00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:29.981
is equal to the square
root of two w plus 12

00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:32.125
plus two w.

00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:35.022
So let's see, if w is
equal to negative four,

00:03:35.022 --> 00:03:38.571
if w is equal to negative four right over,

00:03:38.571 --> 00:03:40.050
let me do something different,

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.680
is equal to negative four.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.574
So, that's going to be six
plus three times negative four

00:03:45.574 --> 00:03:50.574
is equal to the square root
of two times negative four

00:03:50.705 --> 00:03:54.599
plus 12 plus two times negative four.

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.644
So this would be, this
is, negative twelve here.

00:03:58.644 --> 00:04:00.867
This is negative eight here.

00:04:00.867 --> 00:04:02.937
This is negative eight here,

00:04:02.937 --> 00:04:06.789
so you have six plus negative
twelve, which is negative six,

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:11.769
is equal to the square root
of negative eight plus 12,

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.814
is four, plus negative eight.

00:04:15.814 --> 00:04:17.565
So that would be negative six is equal to

00:04:17.565 --> 00:04:19.647
two plus negative eight,

00:04:19.647 --> 00:04:21.187
which is absolutely true.

00:04:21.187 --> 00:04:23.602
So this is definitely a solution.

00:04:23.602 --> 00:04:26.952
And let's try w is equal to negative six.

00:04:26.952 --> 00:04:30.303
So, we is equal to negative six.

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:33.100
So, we're gonna get, if we look
up here, we're going to have

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.469
six plus three times negative six

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:40.819
is equal to the square root
of two times negative six

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:45.083
plus 12 plus two w.

00:04:45.083 --> 00:04:47.888
So, this is gonna be negative 18.

00:04:47.888 --> 00:04:49.929
This is going to be negative 12.

00:04:49.929 --> 00:04:50.663
This is negative 12.

00:04:50.663 --> 00:04:51.925
Negative 12 plus 12 is zero.

00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:54.483
Square root of zero, this is always zero.

00:04:54.483 --> 00:04:55.896
And then two times,

00:04:55.896 --> 00:04:58.432
and actually let me, I shouldn't
have written a w there,

00:04:58.432 --> 00:05:00.364
I should have written
two times negative six.

00:05:00.364 --> 00:05:01.662
So back to what I was doing,

00:05:01.662 --> 00:05:04.559
this right over here is negative eighteen.

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:08.000
This is two times negative six plus 12.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.351
This is all zero.

00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:11.474
Square root of zero is zero.

00:05:11.474 --> 00:05:14.552
And then this is negative twelve.

00:05:14.552 --> 00:05:16.193
So you get six plus negative of eighteen

00:05:16.193 --> 00:05:17.844
which is negative 12.

00:05:17.844 --> 00:05:19.806
Is equal to zero plus negative 12.

00:05:19.806 --> 00:05:20.923
Negative 12.

00:05:20.923 --> 00:05:22.643
Which is absolutely correct.

00:05:22.643 --> 00:05:24.485
So these are actually both solutions

00:05:24.485 --> 00:05:27.453
to our original radical equation.
