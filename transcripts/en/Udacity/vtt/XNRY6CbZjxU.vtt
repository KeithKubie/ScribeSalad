00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We have our second postulate that the speed of light and empty space

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is always c regardless of the frame of reference.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now, this seems like a pretty incredible postulate.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We still don't see any good justification for why this must be the case.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
For example with the train situation, why wouldn't the speed of the light increase

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
if it's coming from a moving train?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Well, there are a few answers for why we believe this.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
One reason is that well it's a mathematical reason--Maxwell's equations

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
which are the equations that describe light.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
These actually seem to predict a constant speed of light, though we won't go into exactly why,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
but the reasons for believing this weren't just mathematical.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Einstein also had empirical evidence.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
One important piece of empirical evidence came from an

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
ingenious experiment done by Michelson and Morley.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm not going to go into that right now but feel free to check out the link

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
below this video if you're interested in reading more.

00:00:53.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The events I want to talk about came from Willem De Sitter.
