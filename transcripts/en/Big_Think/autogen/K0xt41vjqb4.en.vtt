we're continuing to push into the

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170
we're continuing to push into the
 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.480
we're continuing to push into the
meaning of environment so we've gone

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490
meaning of environment so we've gone
 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.070
meaning of environment so we've gone
from physical environments to virtual

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080
from physical environments to virtual
 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.629
from physical environments to virtual
environments and I'm very very

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639
environments and I'm very very
 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.340
environments and I'm very very
interested in these new emerging

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350
interested in these new emerging
 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.800
interested in these new emerging
environments such as social networking

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810
environments such as social networking
 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.750
environments such as social networking
sites which are places which are very

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760
sites which are places which are very
 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.880
sites which are places which are very
interesting places for us projecting our

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890
interesting places for us projecting our
 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.620
interesting places for us projecting our
identity but also reflecting our

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630
identity but also reflecting our
 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.450
identity but also reflecting our
behavior so the sorts of behaviors that

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460
behavior so the sorts of behaviors that
 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.009
behavior so the sorts of behaviors that
go on there I think are very interesting

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019
go on there I think are very interesting
 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.529
go on there I think are very interesting
not you know not frivolous and trivial

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539
not you know not frivolous and trivial
 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.110
not you know not frivolous and trivial
as they often are claimed to be and also

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120
as they often are claimed to be and also

virtual spaces to what's going there

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370
virtual spaces to what's going there
 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.130

because there we don't have constraints

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140
because there we don't have constraints
 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.410
because there we don't have constraints
most of us have constraints in what we

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420
most of us have constraints in what we
 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.060

in the source of places we can create

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070
in the source of places we can create
 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.510
in the source of places we can create
virtual spaces less so and so I think

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520
virtual spaces less so and so I think
 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.880
virtual spaces less so and so I think
looking the connections between people's

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.290
looking the connections between people's
real environments in the virtual

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300
real environments in the virtual
 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.819

opportunities to understand what's going

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149
opportunities to understand what's going
 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.729

on inside our heads you know people

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739

often say well why do what do people use

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989

for a whole bunch of different things

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579
for a whole bunch of different things
 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.219
for a whole bunch of different things
you know there are many different

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229
you know there are many different
 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.490

it's reasonable to to predict that

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
it's reasonable to to predict that
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.580
it's reasonable to to predict that
people in these spaces will both try to

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590
people in these spaces will both try to
 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.210
people in these spaces will both try to
create extensions of themselves but also

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220
create extensions of themselves but also
 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.370
create extensions of themselves but also
experiment with other other possible

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380
experiment with other other possible
 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.740
