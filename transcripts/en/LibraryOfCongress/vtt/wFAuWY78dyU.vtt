Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.350
&gt;&gt; Fenella France:
I'm Fenella France,

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.540
chief of Preservation Research
and Testing Division and I want

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.580
to welcome you to this series of
one of our talks presentations.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.980
We are absolutely
delighted today to be able

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.410
to introduce Randy Silverman,

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.920
who is well known
to many of you.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.740
Randy served as the head of
preservation at the University

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.780
of Utah Marriott
Library since 1993.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.040
He teaches workshops on disaster
planning for the Western States

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.680
and Territories Preservation
Assistance Service WSTPAS

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.670
and is recognized for
his national disaster

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.970
recovery efforts.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.110
He has 80 professional
publications

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.460
and has presented professional
lectures or workshops

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.760
in 30 states and 13
foreign countries,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.400
we'll ask for a list later.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.890
He was given the American
Library Association Banks Harris

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.660
Preservation award in 2013,

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.980
received a Fulbright
specialist award in 2014,

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.890
and was awarded the Utah
Academy of Sciences,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.590
Arts and Letters Gardner prize

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.960
for outstanding academic
contributions in 2016.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.950
When I spoke with Randy last
year and we were starting

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.900
to talk about some
collaborative research

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.200
and he mentioned this project.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.070
And we were talking about you
know some of the challenges

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.730
with some of these
larger projects

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.850
and he very graciously
agreed to come

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.310
and talk with us about this.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.130
So, his presentation today is
a mold outbreak in Tbilisi,

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.850
Georgia, technical and
interpersonal challenges

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.510
and please help me
welcome him today.

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.500
[ Applause ]

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.370
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman:
It's all right,

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:57.950
it's only cords we're fine.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.820
Hello everybody, hello at home.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.020
I'm so glad that you're here.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.210
This is a really wonderful
opportunity, so for the people

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.260
at home today I'm speaking

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.720
from the lovely Mary
Pickford Auditorium.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.070
Do you all remember
Mary Pickford?

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.950
And I'd like to thank
Fenella France who's the chief

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.830
of Preservation Research and
Testing here at the Library

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.750
of Congress for inviting me

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.490
and for this opportunity
to speak today.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.160
I'd like to thank Alberta Comer
who is my dean at the University

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.710
of Utah's Marriott
Library for her support

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.910
because that's why I'm here.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.700
And I'd like to dedicate
this talk to my mom

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.600
who died last year while I was
in Georgia, so there's that.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.200
And of course, my better
half, Eileen Hallett Stone,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.090
who is maybe watching
from home, we don't know,

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.820
and to our colleagues on the
ground doing disaster recovery

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.690
in Puerto Rico after
hurricane Maria.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.750
I'm pleased that the
earthquake yesterday

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.220
in Honduras did not
cause a tsunami,

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.730
which would have further
complicated things.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.040
And for everybody who
has or will spend time

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.590
as Gary Frost puts it
in the disaster fields,

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.180
thank you very much
for your service.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.200
I first met Zurab who's
the library director

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.200
at the University of Tbilisi

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.260
on a US State Department
familiarization tour in 2013.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.660
He and other Georgian library
directors toured the University

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.320
of Utah's Marriott Library

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.170
and when I showed him our
conservation lab he asked me

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.540
questions about mold

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.180
and I didn't know then what
he was really talking about.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.520
But two years later when
this picture appeared

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.870
in the New York Times captioned
zoo animals on the loose

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.360
in Tbilisi after
flooding I was concerned

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.270
and so I contacted
the library to find

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.750
out if the flood
had affected them.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.480
And while the collection
was unharmed

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.130
by that flood this mold
problem was still going on

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.940
and it was still a big issue.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.180
So, the Blue Shield of Georgia
identified grant possibilities

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.960
and along with the library's
conservation department

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.890
at the university wrote a
cultural heritage emergency

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.340
stabilization grant to the
Prince Claus Fund in Amsterdam.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.790
And the first grant was
not successful, but a year

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.030
and a half later the
second one [audio cuts].

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.440
So, I arrived in Tbilisi
on January 27th, 2017,

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.180
which is like a year
ago for a 10-day visit

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.030
and my hosts were Menana
[phonetic] who is pictured

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.010
on your left and who is the
head of Blue Shield and Marie

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.540
who is the paper conservator

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.380
at Tbilisi State
University Library.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.930
Georgia for I had weak
geography as a child,

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.830
so I'm always curious like
on a map falls under Russia

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.600
and is situated near
Turkey and Armenia.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.480
And I mention for the
people viewing from Georgia

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.240
that those striped areas
are the territories

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.030
that were lost during the
2008 Russo Georgian war,

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.760
that war lasted five days,

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.830
and the occupation still
affects 20% of the country.

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.070
When I first arrived,
it had snowed in Tbilisi

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.120
which is unusual
for them and coming

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.770
from Florida I thought
it was great to see snow

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.100
on the palms, this is unusual.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.310
I was also able to see some

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.000
of their wonderful
historic buildings

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.160
like this 12th century
Orthodox Church

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.780
and these 19th century
hot baths,

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.830
which is kind of
a wonderful thing.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.820
And there were carts in the
streets selling colorful spices

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.360
and churchkhela which are
traditional homemade Georgian

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.720
candle-shaped candies.

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.100
It's a really great place,
you should go see it.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.690
So, the main library at Tbilisi
State University was built

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.250
in 1987 and it was out
at the edge of town.

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.720
This is a part of the
city that was new in 1987

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.560
and it was anticipated to grow,

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.490
but the growth never
materialized after the collapse

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.620
of the Soviet Union
December of 1991.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:27.400
So, there was a persistent
lack of maintenance money

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.820
and that's left this
30-year-old building which is

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.840
about 400,000 square
feet largely unheated

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.370
and very run down.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:42.610
In this slide the yellow
parts are the rooms

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.500
where the rare books are
stored, the top one is

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.950
on the first floor belowground

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.230
and the other one is the
second floor above that,

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.170
but it's still belowground.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.630
And there's actually another
room on the second floor sort

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:01.270
of toward the core of the
building, I'm pointing for those

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:05.970
of you at home, I don't
know if you can see that.

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:08.970
So, those rooms were used
for storing rare books

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.970
for a very long time and
they were the problem.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.580
So, we suited up to
go see the rare books.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:21.390
The young woman who's
holding the key was not amused

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.180
by our use of personal
protection equipment she thought

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:27.740
it was weird and was kind of
put out that it took us so long

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.730
to prepare to enter this space.

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:32.690
She's waiting tapping
her foot you know.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:35.520
Notice that at the base
of the walls there's signs

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.120
of moisture damage, that
was prevalent throughout

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.420
the building.

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.880
So, I would constantly see signs

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.410
that there had been
water damage over time.

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.320
So, we entered this space and
it's kind of dark and mysterious

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:53.920
and inside we found 80,000
rare books and that's 80,000

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.280
in these multiple rooms,
that were stolen from Germany

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:01.710
by the retreating Soviet Army
at the end of World War II.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:06.180
So, in the 1970's Germany
asked for the books back

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.060
and they were stored at
two places in Georgia

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.240
and the other library
gave their books back,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.810
they were happy to do it.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.110
However, the University

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.520
of Tbilisi's books
were badly molded.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.810
And so, Germany really wanted
to help, so they offered

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:22.750
to come there and they reviewed
the problem several times

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.730
and finally said you
know it would be easier

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.950
to bring the books to
Germany and treat the problem

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.540
where we have a lot of
equipment and facilities.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.140
And so, they ran with
that idea for a while,

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.990
but there was a glitch because
shipping cultural property

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:40.110
out of Georgia is against
the law, so then they had

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:42.640
to change the law
to be able to do

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.190
that even though the
books belonged to Germany.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.000
And eventually, it just
took years and after

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.290
like a decade Germany said we
actually, we don't care anymore,

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.140
we relinquish our hold

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.270
on the books they're
yours, have a nice day.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:03.180
So, they now legally belong
to Tbilisi State University

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.330
and they're in good shape
when you open the book.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.520
You know they're rare
European imprints

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:13.280
and the paper quality looks
great, there's no problem

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.410
until you see the outside.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:19.450
And the outside was coated
with a thick layer of mold

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:23.370
and the molds changed,
there was different types,

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:26.950
there's dark molds and
light molds and a kind

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:32.260
of patterny [phonetic] mold,
molds like you've never seen.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.390
In fact, I was speaking
with people at the Centers

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:39.310
for Disease Control in the
US and they halfhearted,

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.280
it was half serious in their
jokes saying you know it's a

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:44.860
shame to destroy
such a rare example

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:51.530
of a mature mold
ecosystem and it was.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.580
They were really interesting.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:59.020
And in fact, so I'm
there in in January

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.380
and this is a largely
unheated building,

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.420
it was freezing cold everywhere
except for a few offices.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:09.660
But I was surprised to see
that this ancient stand

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:15.030
of old growth mold was dry
and powdery to the touch

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:18.830
in some cases, you could
just like push it away.

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:22.350
So, it seemed to me
on first observation

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:27.500
that it's actually growing
and thriving in the summer

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.770
and hibernating in the winter
and I didn't know mold did that,

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:34.560
so that was interesting to see.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.750
So, we started looking for
the source of the water

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:42.550
and that orange stripe
represents a 12-inch city

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.260
watermain that's running
underneath the street

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.390
and parallel to the library

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:50.770
that has been leaking
apparently for years.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:54.520
And the university claims that
the city water department needs

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:57.260
to repair their leaking
pipe, that's how it's done

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.120
in Utah at home right.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.160
But the city takes the position
that the pipe is running

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:05.480
through university property and
so it's the university's problem

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.360
and there's been a standoff.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.590
So, the willingness
to ignore a problem

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.410
that was actually causing
standing water in the library

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:17.780
at some points made me realize
that the lack of resources was

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:22.630
so serious for everyone that
not dealing with problems

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.650
like this is what
you have to do,

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:30.240
so that's still taking some
adjustment I have to say.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.950
So, we examined the
building from the basement

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:36.390
to the rooftop looking
for water sources.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:39.520
Don't you love it I'm in a
basement with my suit on,

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.890
this is typical for
tourists right.

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:47.450
And we used a moisture meter,
which is a really great tool

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:48.750
for defining whether

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:51.610
or not there is water
active in the walls.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:52.910
So, some of the damage

00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:55.840
in the walls would not set
off the moisture meter,

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.640
it was just old damage as
opposed to actively being wet

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.460
and in some places, there
was active mold growing

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.150
which was you know
a little weird.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:08.870
And interestingly,
what we were looking

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:13.070
for originally was the source
of water coming from the street,

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:15.890
from that you know because all
the mold damage seemed to be

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:18.860
in those rooms that were on
that side of the building except

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.410
for that other room
that I mentioned,

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.690
which is in the core
of the building.

00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.640
And so, it seemed suspicious

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.580
that the water could reach
the middle of the building

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.880
without having a central source.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:34.770
So, we checked inside the
plumbing chase for the building

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:37.880
which runs parallel to
the stairs, so going up

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:41.040
and the plumbing chase
walls were soaking wet.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.660
So, the plumbing in
the middle of the core

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.780
of the building is
leaking, it's like 30 years

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:50.910
of not fixing the pipes right,
it's a bad problem at home,

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.700
it's a bad problem when you
have a big library like this.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:57.540
So, the Georgian National
Center for Disease Control

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.840
and Public Health
sampled the air

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:04.480
and counted the colony forming
units in these Petri dishes,

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.000
they did lots of testing.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.620
The primary fungi
were Aspergillus

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.720
and the bacteria was nocardia.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:15.200
Their findings though indicated
that and this is a quote,

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.270
the number of colony
forming units

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.980
in the library does
not pose a health risk.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.430
I was kind of surprised, in
the US we'd shut the building

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.670
down right, no question
shut it down.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:32.050
And yet, this is kind of the
response that you might get

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:34.960
if there's actually not
a way to deal with this

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.580
and everybody agrees what
can we do, we can do nothing,

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.570
we have to accept this.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:43.480
So, I kept running into things
that were a little peculiar

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.300
in my orientation, but
it was a little scary

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:50.770
because in fact the library
is the testing center

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.990
for the university, there
were about 2,000 people

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:55.580
in the building a day and
I talked to some people

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.780
and they got, they had
gotten sick or were sick

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:00.680
and they were worried.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.460
So, I met with the
library's administration,

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:09.290
this is Zurab again
back in Georgia

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:12.580
and I expressed my concerns
about the health issues

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:15.400
and agreed to help diagnose
the problem, try and look

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.480
for the source of water
and to define a protocol

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.300
that would allow them to
recover the rare books

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.640
because in fact the books
looked pretty good except

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:25.020
for the outside coating of mold.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:31.420
And so, Marie and Menana helped
assemble a team of local people

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.090
that included Lowry
[phonetic] who's here sketching

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.450
because he's the one of the
buildings original architects,

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:42.780
he was always sketching and
now retired, but he wanted

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.080
to be part of the project

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.530
because he still
loved the building

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:48.620
and it just it broke his heart
it had not been cared for,

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.750
which is pretty wonderful.

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:52.420
And Lasha [phonetic]
whose got his back

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.340
to us who's a really
wonderful man

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.870
and he's a preservation
architect.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.730
So, we started thinking
about the problem and we met

00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:04.960
for several days trying to work
out you know what an affordable,

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:08.420
underline affordable, culturally
appropriate solution would

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.720
look like.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.520
So, here we see the back
of Menana's head and Lowry

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.780
and Lasha and in this picture,

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.330
we have Giorgi [phonetic]
who's the heating, ventilating

00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:21.270
and air-conditioning engineer
who's joined us and members

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.050
of the preservation department.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:29.360
I have to hurry now,
that was my mother.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.820
Other people who contributed

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:37.750
to a proposed solution long
distance included Kirk Lively,

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:41.560
who's the director of
technical services at Belfor.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.590
Bernard Mayer, whose Belfor's
major loss operations person

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:49.490
in Europe who actually
volunteered to come to Georgia

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:54.590
and set up the drying and
the air ventilation solution

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.270
for just his travel costs.

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:58.760
He was going to come on his
own time and just volunteer

00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:01.700
to do that, which is
really extraordinary.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.090
Allen Rogers at a company
called Zentox in Canada,

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:08.380
which is an air purification
company.

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:12.390
Ian Poole Corroventa, a supplier

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.820
of dehumidification
equipment in England.

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:16.210
Because there's a big
problem how are we going

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:18.920
to get this stuff to Georgia.

00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:23.220
And Doctors Cox, Ganser
[phonetic] and Park

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.010
at the Centers for
Disease Control

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:28.130
and Prevention in
the United States.

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:32.540
So, we all agreed as Kirk Lively
put it that the building had

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:36.300
to be dried first to stop
the mold bloom, makes sense.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.060
So, vacuuming mold off the
books and then returning them

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.360
to a humid environment only
provides a temporary solution

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.820
and will allow the mold
to continue thriving.

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.510
So, Lawry recommended we
dig an architectural gallery

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:50.980
on three sides of the building

00:16:50.980 --> 00:16:53.880
and that's what the yellow
arrow is pointing to.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.330
And a gallery which is
a term I didn't know is,

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:02.640
this is an example of a
gallery I found someplace else,

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:03.980
they're using these.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.220
This is an architectural
gallery in this case designed

00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.800
to allow people to see historic
foundations of a building

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.890
so you could use it
for that purpose.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:16.200
The library's gallery
would be graded on top,

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.540
so it would get air ventilation
and people could walk over it.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.100
Be bricked on one side so the,
you know, to keep the dirt

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:25.640
from caving in and
allow this airspace

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.030
where the airflow would dry
the walls of the building

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:31.120
and prevent moisture from
coming in direct contact

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:34.230
with the basement walls
and if it did it would dry

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:35.540
because of air circulation.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.540
It seemed like a pretty
neat idea, we're talking

00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:41.260
about digging a hole around the
building right, pretty simple.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.880
So, we took that idea
and presented it to Nunu

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:47.020
who is the chancellor for
Tbilisi State University

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:49.670
in an hour-long meeting.

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.500
And we kept the proposal
as simple

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.350
and cost-effective as possible.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:55.470
So, here I'm presenting
a PowerPoint summation

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:58.680
of our recommendations
and I'm using a laptop

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:01.780
so that was the most
straightforward way to do that.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:06.570
And in in the room are
also Zurab and there's Nunu

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:10.710
in the background, Marie
and other administrators.

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:13.760
So, while I was there the
library people also asked me

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.240
to give a public lecture on
the causes of mold and ways

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.430
to mitigate those
kinds of problems.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:22.900
And so, the talk
was well attended,

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.730
you kind of like
you guys showing

00:18:24.730 --> 00:18:26.030
up that's really wonderful.

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.900
And it was a Saturday
afternoon and we were

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.960
in the other library, it turned
out there's another library

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.360
in the main campus in the
middle of Tbilisi which was neat

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.370
as a pin right, so
that was also a clue

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.320
that maybe this other
library wasn't loved

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.240
for some reason, I don't know.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.660
So, I gave a talk about what I
think we know as a profession

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.910
about mold and if
you'll permit me I'd

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:50.880
like to share those
ideas with you.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.000
Actually, it's the core of what
I want to talk about today,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.430
it's the meaningful
part, the takeaway.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:19:01.680
So, while nobody knows
for certain how many types

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.000
of mold there are, it's
estimated that there are

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.760
between 100,000 and 300,000
species of mold on earth along

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.820
with the ants and
the buzzards okay.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:18.520
The fungi represent
approximately 3 1/2%

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.820
of all living species,
so it seems clear to me

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:26.310
that mold is not
an afterthought.

00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:32.520
Common indoor mold species
include Cladosporium,

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:36.680
Penicillium, Alternaria
and Aspergillus,

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.550
they're here, they're around us.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:42.220
What you may not know this and
this is an interesting thing

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:47.530
to consider, one cubic meter of
outdoor air may contain as many

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:50.160
as a million spores okay.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.320
And a grown person at
rest inhales about two

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.800
and half gallons
of air per minute.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.170
So, what that means is on
average people inhale close

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:05.480
to 600,000 spores per
hour all the time okay,

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.780
interesting right.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:10.700
But inside a moldy building like
that it could be 10 times that,

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:17.300
so 600,000 is your minimal
daily dose per hour okay,

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.500
that's normal, a normal day.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:24.720
Mycelium is a vegetative part of
the fungi consisting of a mass

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.210
of branching threadlike hyphae.

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:32.390
The white or transparent hyphae
may be minute forming a colony

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:34.540
that's too small to see

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.750
or the mycelium might
be extensive appearing

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:42.530
like very fine fluffy white
threads over the surface.

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:46.390
Mycelium is considered
a single organism.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:51.210
Typically mold secrete
hydraulic enzymes mainly

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:56.610
from the hyphae tips to
degrade complex biopolymers,

00:20:56.610 --> 00:21:00.460
biopolymers such as starch,
cellulose and lignin,

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:03.230
our stuff right into
simpler monomers

00:21:03.230 --> 00:21:05.550
that can be absorbed by hyphae.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:09.000
Molds play a vital role in
causing the decomposition

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.990
of organic matter
that enables recycling

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:16.590
of nutrients throughout the
ecosystems, it's good for us.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:22.070
When mold is ready to reproduce
small treelike fruiting bodies

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:24.480
form on the ends of the hyphae.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:27.690
The dusty texture of
many molds is caused

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:31.990
by the profuse production of
asexual spores called conidia

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:34.740
that grow on the
tree-shaped hyphae.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.820
The mode of formation
and the shape

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:39.720
of these spores is
traditionally used as the method

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.700
for classifying molds.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.060
These spores come in a variety

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:48.020
of colors making the fungus much
more obvious to the human eye

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.290
at this stage in its lifecycle.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:53.070
So, we like it when it's pretty
or we don't really don't like it

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.660
when it's pretty, it depends.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:57.740
When we think of
mold germinating

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:01.930
in dark warm damp humid
places we tend to forget

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:05.140
that mold also grows in
the refrigerator right.

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.920
So, the question is and this is
the question for you guys right,

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.800
how long will a jar
of applesauce stored

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:16.320
under Saran wrap be
good to eat right.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.220
Three days, a week?

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.950
Do you have a teenager?

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:24.550
If your refrigerator is
working right it's probably fine

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:25.850
for a week right,

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.850
but if applesauce is forgotten
behind the other groceries

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:33.210
for three weeks there might
be a tipping point somewhere.

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:37.150
The deal is if food is sitting

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:40.390
around for some time it can
cause an activation trigger

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.440
for mold when the storage
environment is right.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.740
Environmental factors

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.210
that affect mold growth
include the standard

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:49.930
environmental factors.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.640
Temperature, a refrigerator
in good repair hovers

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:58.560
around 37 degrees Fahrenheit or
3 degrees Celsius for my folks

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:02.420
at Georgia, but cold,
it's cold but not frozen.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:07.030
The relative humidity of
applesauce is very humid.

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:10.610
Light levels in the refrigerator
are nice and dark right

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:13.110
and airflow which is restricted

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:17.870
by the Saran wrap
may be an issue okay.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:23.960
So, our Finnish colleagues Hukka
and Vitanen developed a model

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:28.140
that characterizes six
stages of mold growth.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.660
Of these the first two stages
include no visible sign

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:35.540
of mold except under
magnification right,

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:38.600
it's among us but we
can't really see it.

00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.780
That leads us to remember that
mold may be actively growing

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:46.610
around us, but we
are not aware of it.

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:47.980
So, if you allow me

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:52.450
to anthropomorphize
the question a little.

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:55.130
What is the tipping point
at which mold decides

00:23:55.130 --> 00:23:58.990
that an open jar of applesauce
is fair game all right,

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:01.220
when will that occur?

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.830
And for that I think we
need to call in the experts.

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:09.310
So, I'm going to tap into Monty
Python who will try and answer

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:11.920
for us the age-old
question, how can you tell

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.760
when an object is really dead.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.740
&gt;&gt; Here's one, nine pence.

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:19.370
&gt;&gt; I'm not dead.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:20.760
&gt;&gt; What?

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.400
&gt;&gt; Nothing, here's
your nine pence.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:23.830
&gt;&gt; I'm not dead.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:25.660
&gt;&gt; Here, he says he's not dead.

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:26.960
&gt;&gt; Yes, he is.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.260
&gt;&gt; I'm not.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.560
&gt;&gt; He isn't.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.860
&gt;&gt; Well, he will be
soon, he's very ill.

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:32.160
&gt;&gt; I'm getting better.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:37.740
&gt;&gt; No, you're not, you'll
be stone dead in a moment.

00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:42.180
&gt;&gt; Oh, I can't take him like
that, it's against regulations.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:44.670
&gt;&gt; I don't want to
go in the cart.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.650
&gt;&gt; Oh, don't be such a baby.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:48.310
&gt;&gt; I can't take him.

00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:49.610
&gt;&gt; I feel fine.

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:50.910
&gt;&gt; Oh, do us a favor.

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:52.210
&gt;&gt; I can't.

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.030
&gt;&gt; Well, can you hang
around a couple of minutes?

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.330
He won't be long.

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:56.730
&gt;&gt; Nah, I got to go

00:24:56.730 --> 00:24:58.130
on to Robinson's
they've lost nine today.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:59.430
&gt;&gt; Well, when is
your next round?

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:00.730
&gt;&gt; Thursday.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:02.030
&gt;&gt; I think I'll go for a walk.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:03.330
&gt;&gt; You're not fooling
anyone you know.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:04.630
Look, isn't there
something you can do?

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:05.930
&gt;&gt; I feel happy, I feel happy.

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:07.230
&gt;&gt; Ah, thanks very much.

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:08.530
&gt;&gt; Not at all.

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:09.830
See you on Thursday.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:11.130
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:12.430
[ Laughter ]

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:13.730
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman: The earth
does not leave dead things lying

00:25:13.730 --> 00:25:15.030
around for long.

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:16.900
Buzzards and ants and
mold all work to clean

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:21.340
up mother nature's dead to
recycle them back to carbon.

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:27.630
It's part of the complex balance
the governs our lovely blue

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:31.770
jewellike and very
hungry planet.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:38.450
For mold the rules are
really quite simple,

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:43.160
if it's breathing it's not
dead and it's not food,

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.660
where there's breath
there's life.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.400
Wind is just the
planet breathing

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.650
as far as mold is concerned.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:53.760
So, we should remember it's when
things get out of equilibrium

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.540
that mold feels invited
to the feast.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.150
So, let's look at
a couple examples.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:02.630
This is Lascaux Cave some
drawings from Lascaux Cave

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:06.660
in southwestern France, we're
not in France now I'll clarify

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:10.590
that point, though you at
home may be I don't know.

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:13.680
So, the cave contains some
600 paintings believed

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:16.370
to be 17,300 years old.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:20.310
It's among the most significant
cultural artifacts on earth

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:26.000
and was inscribed in UNESCO's
World Heritage list in 1979.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.580
Lascaux Cave was discovered
by 18-year-old Marcel Ravidat

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:34.660
and three friends who were
trying to rescue their dog

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.660
who had fallen through a
foxhole in September of 1940.

00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:42.280
You had to be a kid
to find those drawings

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:45.320
because they were nowhere
near the entrance of the cave

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:49.580
and they were hidden in complete
darkness right, teenagers.

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:54.850
Like most caves Lascaux was
perpetually cold and very humid

00:26:54.850 --> 00:27:00.170
above 95% and it was
free of visible mold.

00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:04.360
Wanting to share this important
find a large-scale earthwork was

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.480
begun in 1947.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:09.010
And so, they redesigned
the cave's entrance

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:11.940
to permit visitor access.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.640
This permanently

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:17.790
and irreversibly changed the
natural equilibrium inside the

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:21.460
cave and black mold was
first reported on the walls

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:24.920
in 1947 in that same year.

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.250
The cave opened to the
public July of 1948

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:45.460
and by 1955 Lascaux received
30,000 visitors per year.

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:50.360
By 1960, that was 100,000
people which works out to

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:57.650
about 1,800 visitors per day
at its peak and an average

00:27:57.650 --> 00:27:59.750
of 70 people per hour right,

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:01.870
things were really
crowded there.

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:07.540
In 1950, they put a stairway
and a double access door in

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:11.660
and it was designed as
an airlock specifically,

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.040
that's indicated
by the blue arrow.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:20.770
During the 1955 tourist season
the cave experienced abnormally

00:28:20.770 --> 00:28:24.770
high levels of carbon dioxide,
condensation on the walls,

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:26.530
and high temperatures.

00:28:26.530 --> 00:28:28.560
So, what would you do?

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:32.710
They put in an HVAC system
in 1958 and it was able

00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:34.420
to maintain the cave's
temperature

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:41.620
at 57 degrees Fahrenheit which
is 14 degrees C and 95% Rh,

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:46.960
normal is 95% Rh right,
that's interesting right,

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:50.710
it doesn't mold all the
time just because it's wet.

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:52.460
Although this prevented
condensation

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:56.180
on the walls discrete green
spots however described

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:59.270
by the curator as green
disease were noted

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:03.500
in 1960 near the artwork
in the axial gallery.

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:07.260
By 1963, this mold
outbreak became denser

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:09.700
and extended to the
hall of bulls.

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:12.060
The cave was closed to
the public that year

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.950
and the committee convened
to study the problem.

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:18.500
Antibiotics and formalin
were used to kill the mold

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.380
on the floors and the walls,

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:24.370
including the painted
surfaces themselves.

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:29.990
That original HVAC system
failed in 1998 after 40 years

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:31.680
of service and it was replaced

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:36.860
by an improved hydrothermal
regulator in 1999.

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:40.000
This precipitated the active
mold event now referred

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.350
to as the crisis of 2001.

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:46.130
Here we see air sampling
being conducted

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:48.830
in Lascaux Caves axial gallery.

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:52.260
The mold species
determined to be responsible

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.710
for the outbreak was
identified as Fusarium Solani

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:59.740
and here we see visible signs
of the active mold growth

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.580
in the axial gallery in 2001.

00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:07.180
So, treatment options were
explored for killing the mold

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:11.150
on the walls and paintings
during the crisis of 2001

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:14.230
and these included,
this is radical,

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:19.160
gassing Lascaux methyl bromide
raising the carbon levels

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:22.090
so the environment would
become lethal to the mold

00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.130
and other biological measures.

00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:25.730
Each of those ideas
was determined

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:27.630
to be too risky for the artwork.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:31.970
In the end, quaternary ammonium

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:35.510
which is alkyl dimethyl
benzyl ammonium chloride,

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:36.810
which is a fungicide used

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:40.280
in the papermaking
industry proved effective.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.610
This was used in conjunction

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:44.370
with spreading quicklime
on the floors.

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:49.000
Quicklime is a caustic
calcium oxide and it was used

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.130
to raise the cave's Ph and
dehydrate the microorganisms.

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:58.320
Here we see a poultice
containing the fungicide being

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.560
used directly over the artwork.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.050
You'll be comforted to know

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:05.440
that a literature search assured
the participants this approach

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:09.000
would prove harmless
to the rock art.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:13.210
A second example of mold
getting its signals crossed due

00:31:13.210 --> 00:31:15.720
to an environmental
imbalance occurred

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:19.940
after Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:24.480
I visited Biloxi Public Library
with my friend Gary Frost

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:28.370
where we found some of the
windows broken in the library

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.930
so there was airflow
inside the building

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:33.560
and there were pine
needles on the floor

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:37.080
about a foot and a half deep.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:40.480
It was surreal to walk on it,
it's like walking on mattresses.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.910
So, we're padding lightly
inside of the library,

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:47.480
which in fact showed no visible
signs of mold three weeks

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.640
after the storm, though
it was summertime,

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.230
it was really hot, very humid.

00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:55.610
Eventually the building would
be lost to mold however.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:01.180
We did find, however, in the
basement a glass exhibit case

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:04.110
that did not get directly
wet, was raised up,

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:08.710
but it's a closed
glass, locked glass case

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:11.510
and it contains these baskets
that are completely covered

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:14.910
in gray mold, that gray is
not the way the baskets looked

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:18.550
before the mold this is after.

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:21.990
The rare book room which was
kind of a sequestered space

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:26.990
in the building had map drawers
that were when you pulled them

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:29.570
out the mold was thriving.

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:31.610
And this is an interesting
one okay,

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:36.190
inside of a storage cabinet
Gary found this Tyvek envelope

00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:37.800
that was molding badly,

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:41.820
but inside the same storage
cabinet there were paper

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.860
envelopes with similar books
in them in the same drawer

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:46.620
that were not molding.

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:51.300
The Tyvek envelope made the
book look like that right,

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:57.700
what does that tell us, do
you think I'm leading you?

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.640
I'm glad you're a
bunch of smart folks.

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.180
So, I'd like to look at some
preventive concepts right,

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.570
to balance that out
a little bit.

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:08.870
So, here let's start with
the great pyramid of Khufu.

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:11.900
This is the oldest and
largest of the three pyramids

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.330
in the Giza pyramid complex
and it's also the oldest

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:17.550
of the seven wonders
of the ancient world

00:33:17.550 --> 00:33:20.890
and the only one still
remaining largely intact.

00:33:20.890 --> 00:33:23.250
A unique feature
of this pyramid is

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:27.000
that the king's burial
chamber is cross-ventilated.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.040
Here we can see in the image
air vents that penetrate

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:33.680
from the pyramid's north and
south faces and all the way

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.070
into the king's burial chamber.

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:41.740
The queen's chamber also has air
vents and while they're longer

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.620
than the vents for the king's
burial chamber they were

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:45.940
never completed.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.460
So, they're 20 feet short
of reaching the outside

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.240
of the pyramid interesting.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.270
But that room was
never used so maybe

00:33:53.270 --> 00:33:55.720
that explains why they didn't
bother to complete them

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.710
or they're waiting you know.

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:01.630
The air vents into the king's
chamber supply a fresh flow

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:05.220
of air in the otherwise
stagnant space.

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.700
but they're not straight
channels.

00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.500
The northern air duct for
instance, measures 5 by 7 inches

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.350
and begins as a dome-shaped vent

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:18.180
that penetrates the granite
wall horizontally for 6 inches,

00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:20.760
changes shape to an
oval that angles upward

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:23.580
for another 8 inches, and
then changes shape again

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:27.510
to a rectangle that
passes through 160 feet

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:30.830
of granite masonry to the
exterior of the pyramid.

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:34.880
Additionally, with each
shape shift the duct changes

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:40.420
direction, so it first heads due
south, then it heads southwest

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:43.090
and then further southwest.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:47.500
So, these air ducts that's the
actual, it's a picture it's hard

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.510
to make it out until
you focus on it right,

00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:52.800
but that's a picture of the
air duct that I just described

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.320
where it begins in
the king's chamber.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.200
So these, you know, realize
how intentional this is.

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.280
You had to cut the ducts

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:04.130
in the granite blocks before
you laid them in place.

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:09.910
This is all preliminary to
actually setting these stones.

00:35:09.910 --> 00:35:13.750
So, one might argue that this
natural cross-ventilation was

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:16.970
needed to provide fresh air
during the pharaoh's funeral

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.700
rites which were performed

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.690
by porch light inside
the core of the pyramid.

00:35:22.690 --> 00:35:27.830
It's also a possibility, this is
what I'm proposing we consider

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:30.030
you conservation types,

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:32.920
that this is a thoughtful
architectural feature designed

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:36.300
to provide appropriate
environmental storage conditions

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.890
for the ages.

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:41.170
Can we have a vote, can
we have a show of hands?

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:47.340
So, there are other more recent
examples, let me show you.

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:51.550
This is a classic
18th-century cedar hope chest,

00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:54.420
notice it's raised off
the floor and the lid

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.360
which is you know cut
from wood is not airtight,

00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.640
so we get airflow below it
and through that little gap

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.410
in the lip of the cover.

00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:08.730
This effectively promotes
slow, steady ventilation

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:12.270
and a stable environment,
it's in the human comfort zone

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.590
at the foot of the bed.

00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:17.180
This is a 19th-century
iron bookshelf

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:19.720
that has a screen
grate at the bottom

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:25.180
and it promotes air circulation
behind and around the books.

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:28.170
This is one from the US
Department of Agriculture,

00:36:28.170 --> 00:36:32.200
freshly picked and shelled high
moisture corn can present a mold

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.770
problem in storage.

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:37.790
The alternative is
and this is from 1969,

00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:42.250
is to use unheated outside
air forced through a grate

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:45.480
at the bottom of the storage
container, which then filters

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:52.250
up through the top of the unit,
so airflow equals no mold,

00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:54.620
long-term grain storage.

00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:57.970
Elementary schools closed for
the summer lock all the doors

00:36:57.970 --> 00:36:59.480
and windows and they're trying

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:02.790
to prevent vandalism makes
sense except this can lead

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:04.930
to a mold outbreak by the
time they come back to open

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:07.340
up the building in the fall.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:12.350
So, a way to prevent a mold
bloom could be as simple

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:15.880
as opening up the windows a
crack and allowing the building

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.820
to breathe like a cave.

00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:22.260
But I think the most
telling example is

00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:26.530
that I am breathing
600,000 mold spores an hour

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:30.160
and I'm not breaking
out in mold.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.590
Those conidia are
certainly landing in a warm,

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:36.680
dark and humid environment
right.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.880
But I think in each of these
examples we can see the

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:43.000
usefulness or the
necessity of allowing airflow

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.410
to prevent mold growth right,

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:52.390
what if we could actually
communicate with it, maybe not.

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:57.010
But there are triggers for mold
events and that's what we have

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:58.490
to wrap our head around.

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:02.690
When do we see it coming
right, when is it a possibility

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:05.090
that we're going to actually
have this thing happen

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:06.760
because the moment
before it's happened

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:10.480
like the Biloxi public library
things are good and eventually

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:12.430
that building was torn down.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:16.170
So, ways that we can deal with
it include conservation heating,

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:21.240
dehumidification and
adaptive ventilation.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:25.680
Heating right, it's a kind
of counterintuitive thing,

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.890
in the summertime and Biloxi
would we actually turn

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:34.330
up the heat, but warm air holds
more moisture than cold air

00:38:34.330 --> 00:38:36.870
so there's an option
in some circumstances.

00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:41.230
But alternatively, the one
I like the most is desiccant

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.640
or refrigerant dehumidification,

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.590
which can effectively lower the
relative humidity inside great

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:50.860
big buildings to 25%
and rapidly dries

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:54.660
out everything, everything.

00:38:55.740 --> 00:39:01.290
Adaptive ventilation promotes
drying, so air passing

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:03.930
over a wet surface
retains water.

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:07.870
According to a 2004
study by Tim Padfield,

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:11.110
moving air becomes completely
saturated when it passes

00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:15.230
over wet material
regardless of the air's speed.

00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:19.190
So, airflow changes surface
tension causing evaporation

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:22.090
that can prevent
fungal growth in caves,

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:25.310
elementary schools
and in my lungs.

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:29.020
Tyvek envelopes, sealed
glass exhibit cases,

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:30.340
and locked doors intended

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:33.730
to protect rare books prevent
airflow that can readily lead

00:39:33.730 --> 00:39:35.990
to an environmental imbalance.

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:39.630
As noted by Monty Python and
now I'm quoting the best,

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:41.790
the difference between
the living and the dead is

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:45.370
so tenuous that it can
be easily mistaken.

00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:48.790
This is an essential
truth for mold.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:53.300
In situations where there's
no ready access to electricity

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.970
as with this Historical Society

00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:58.410
in rural Mississippi flooded
during Hurricane Katrina,

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:02.320
the only option may be to
simply open the windows right,

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.690
it makes sense.

00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:06.460
There are conditions where we
would find that very difficult,

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:10.580
but in theory this will
change the environment inside

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.130
and it might help.

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:15.180
The problem in this particular
case was the curators were more

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:18.210
concerned about vandals
than they were about mold

00:40:18.210 --> 00:40:20.600
and so they kept shutting
the windows, they would leave

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.280
and they would shut the windows.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.940
Sterilization is a technical
option when we're dealing

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:30.380
with mold and so it
should be discussed,

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.480
but we should not
use it casually.

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:35.760
The caption on this cartoon
reads wanting his picnic

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:39.620
with Gwen to be perfect Hal made
sure they would not be bothered

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.600
by ants.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.720
Sterilization is expensive, it
can damage cultural property,

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:46.760
but when flooding
involves sewage

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:51.790
or other biological human risks
it may be necessary to consider.

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:56.650
So, let me touch on it
briefly, due diligence right.

00:40:56.650 --> 00:40:58.250
The image of a commercial,

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:00.720
this image of a commercial
ethylene oxide chamber was

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.050
provided by Sterigenics.

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:06.880
The effectiveness of ethylene
oxide sterilization is dependent

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:10.280
on load density,
gas concentration,

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:12.990
steam inject, and
the cycle time.

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:15.890
Each of these factors have to
be correctly applied in order

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:19.150
for the sterilization
process to be effective.

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:23.330
Ethylene oxide is non-damaging
to paper as verified

00:41:23.330 --> 00:41:25.560
in the 1960's by
Francois [inaudible].

00:41:25.560 --> 00:41:31.530
This is a schematic of a
gamma radiation chamber

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:35.030
that was also provided
by Sterigenics.

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:37.450
You can see that it's a
simple system actually,

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:44.180
it's a lead shell with a core
of nuclear material inside.

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:47.980
And the stuff that you need
to sterilize passes by that.

00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:51.630
Gamma radiation sterilization
is a simpler process

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:53.360
than ethylene oxide.

00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.370
The density of the product
determines the cycle time

00:41:56.370 --> 00:42:00.150
and the dosage required
in the radiator.

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:01.850
The validation process
is shorter,

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:04.850
so it may cost less
than ethylene oxide.

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:09.900
However, gamma radiation
cleaves covalent bonds,

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.660
which makes it absolutely
damaging

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.960
to cultural property,
just a heads up.

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.800
At the end of the
day killing mold

00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:20.560
by sterilization is a little

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.540
like bringing pesticides
to a picnic however.

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.560
Whether mold is dead or merely
inactive due to the lack

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.270
of moisture it's
the same effect,

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:31.520
it doesn't really matter.

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:34.630
Inactive mold stops
consuming organic material

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:36.560
and it desiccates.

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.860
It could do no further harm

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:41.510
if environmental conditions
prevent its recurrence

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:46.770
and the desiccated mold can
be vacuumed up with a HEPA vac

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:48.790
or it can just simply
be brushed away.

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:50.910
And you should do this
outside with the wind coming

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:53.300
over your shoulder so you
don't actually get a face full

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.440
of desiccated mold.

00:42:55.440 --> 00:43:02.120
So, thank you for that detour,
back on the point of the talk.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.840
I got back to the United States
after my trip to Georgia,

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:07.540
a wonderful place
you should visit,

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:10.940
it really was great,
I loved it actually.

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:13.790
And I wrote a final
report defining the source

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:16.100
of the mold problem and
providing the library

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:19.170
with a protocol for
recovery of its rare books.

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:22.460
In summary, you know,
we can summarize,

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:28.230
in our easy armchairs
we can summarize.

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:31.250
The way to deal with
this problem in Georgia

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:34.830
in my estimation and
that of colleagues was

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:38.560
that the free water must be
eliminated in the building

00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.920
and to do that we would
need to construct a gallery

00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:44.970
on three sides of the
building to provide a barrier

00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:48.430
between the groundwater
and the basement walls.

00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:52.560
We would need to repair the
culinary water pipes in the core

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:55.970
of the building and realize
those are running in the walls,

00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:58.540
that may be really difficult.

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:06.050
And we decided we really needed
to add downspouts to be able

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:10.260
to move the rainwater away
from the base of the building.

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:11.560
Everything we could do

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:13.270
to eliminate water
into the building.

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:17.610
The mold spores need to be
prevented from spreading

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:19.670
into the rest of the building
while we're trying to deal

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:22.580
with these really,
really moldy rooms.

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:26.500
So those rooms need to
be positively ventilated,

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:30.230
that's kind of a trick because
they're down in a subbasement.

00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:33.710
But what we need to
do is exhaust the air

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:39.330
from the room while we're
drying it through HEPA filters

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:42.290
and exhausted to the outside,
not through the building

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:45.330
or get the hoses to go
through the building.

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:47.210
So, it's a little
complicated, it's the kind

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:49.900
of equipment we wouldn't
have lying around.

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.540
But we could bring equipment
in and I talked to people

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:54.920
who are willing to do it.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:58.660
So next, the storage rooms
needed to be dehumidified

00:44:58.660 --> 00:45:00.680
and that would dehydrate
the mold

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:03.760
and once it was dehydrated
it would be inactive

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:07.740
and so the desiccated mold
could be cleaned simply enough

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:13.000
by HEPA vacuuming it up, we
could just HEPA vac up the mold

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.070
and on the books on the
walls on the shelves.

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:18.890
Whether we did the books in
the same room or not was open

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:22.200
to discussion, but we could
even start there just vacuuming

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:23.500
them up.

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:25.580
And then the walls
and the shelves needed

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:27.720
to be washed with
soap and water.

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:30.090
That was from the CDC
and I was fascinated

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:32.740
because they're not talking
about the use of chlorine

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:35.330
at all, soap and water.

00:45:35.330 --> 00:45:37.790
Because in fact adding chlorine

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:40.800
to the environment
might bother people

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:43.790
who have already got
sensitivities going on because

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:45.970
of all that mold and
of course all this has

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:49.360
to be done wearing personal
protective equipment.

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:53.370
And afterwards we need to
judiciously aerate the rooms

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:58.310
and the building, find
a way to create airflow.

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:00.900
But now a year later I am sorry

00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:05.460
to report mold is
still on the books.

00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.740
I've had a report from Georgia

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:13.400
that they had some
success repairing that pipe

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:18.280
out on the street and so maybe
that source of water is gone,

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:22.260
but I think the water inside
the building is still a

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:24.200
major problem.

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:27.270
I was actually really, I'm
still really disappointed

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:30.840
with this outcome and
maybe that's the way I want

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:34.550
to leave this talk this
morning or this afternoon,

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:37.230
it's still morning where I live.

00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:44.380
If we come from out of
country and offer up solutions

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:45.680
that seem simple enough,

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.560
seem reasonable it doesn't mean
they're actually affordable,

00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:53.790
it doesn't mean that they're
within the scope of the kind

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:56.720
of work people can
actually take on

00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:59.730
or that they meet the
priorities of the people.

00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:04.990
And I don't know what those are,
but I don't think they're books.

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:09.700
And this is a historic
building that's being preserved

00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:12.380
by just leaving it in spaces.

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:15.030
They've protected it in
that it's identified as such

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:16.840
in this whole region of town,

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:21.100
including this next slide
behind Marie, those are supports

00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:25.680
for a historic part of town,
18th and 19th century buildings

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:29.140
that they're preventing from
falling in by having put braces

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:32.040
in place, but there's no
money for repairing them.

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:35.780
So, at this point in
the history of Tbilisi

00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:40.530
and of Georgia there are
bigger issues then dealing

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:43.500
with some things like
cultural property.

00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:50.320
And so, we have to delay our
ambition to see a solution,

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:54.330
it would make me happy, it would
make her happy, and I don't know

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:57.450
when it's going to happen.

00:47:57.450 --> 00:48:00.650
I'd like to thank a
whole bunch of people,

00:48:00.650 --> 00:48:05.460
the people in Georgia, people
of the CDC, Kirk Lively,

00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:11.020
the bunch of folks at Belfor,
for people at Sterigenics.

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:15.030
And Jeff David who actually
decorated this paper,

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:21.020
that's a splatter design on
paper that's not actually mold,

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:22.950
well you knew that right.

00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:25.510
So, I'll leave it with
that, thank you very much.

00:48:25.510 --> 00:48:32.500
[ Applause ]

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:36.460
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: Do we
have questions for Randy?

00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:38.230
I'm actually going to
ask Randy for the benefit

00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:41.620
of our people offsite to repeat
and rephrase the question.

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:42.920
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman: Thank you.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.220
&gt;&gt; Fenella France:
Any questions?

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:45.740
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman: Oh, I can
rephrase it, so I'll tell lies.

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:47.780
Now is my chance,
I'm in Washington.

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:52.730
Oh wait, that was not
nice sorry, sorry.

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:54.030
Who's got a question?

00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:55.330
Yes.

00:48:55.330 --> 00:49:02.180
&gt;&gt; Randy, just for clarification
the galleries were not built

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:03.480
for this [inaudible]?

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:04.780
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman:
Correct, we were not able

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.080
to build the galleries, at least

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:07.610
to this point they
have not built.

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:12.700
&gt;&gt; I imagine that would be
pretty expensive to undertake?

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.000
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman: Every --

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.300
so, the is you know
would it be prohibitive

00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:16.600
because it's expensive.

00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.640
It's a big building,
but honestly the beauty

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:22.200
of the idea was that
it was digging a hole

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:26.310
and that manual labor or
a backhoe was within scope

00:49:26.310 --> 00:49:29.680
of the kinds of things
people could imagine doing.

00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:34.510
Bringing dehumidifiers was not
necessarily and so there's sort

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:40.430
of you know levels of buy-in,
but it didn't seem strange

00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:42.460
to the local people,
to the architect

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:46.780
and to the preservation
architect to be able to dig

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:49.640
that gallery, and they've
done other similar projects.

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:53.870
I think, however, at this
particular moment in the history

00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:56.600
of Georgia it's not as possible

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:58.990
as it might've been
10 years ago,

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:03.700
so I think it's actually the
time at which this is occurring.

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.590
Does that help?

00:50:05.590 --> 00:50:06.890
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:08.190
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman: Thank you.

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:09.490
Please Andrew.

00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:13.450
&gt;&gt; So, is there some
impediment to moving the books

00:50:13.450 --> 00:50:16.320
like it seems like the
building is the problem,

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:20.370
so you have moldy books,
the books could be moved

00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:23.820
to another location, but
undoubtedly there's a reason

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:25.790
that this, I mean were not.

00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:28.490
But it just seems
like [inaudible].

00:50:28.490 --> 00:50:30.450
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman: So, Andrew's
question for those of you

00:50:30.450 --> 00:50:32.010
at home I'll try
and do a better job,

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:34.380
I'm a reporter on the scene.

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:37.590
Andrew suggests that
it would be reasonable

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:42.630
to move the moldy books to a
different space and clean them

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:45.970
up and keep the books there.

00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:48.110
It's a good idea and let me say

00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:50.450
that we talked about
it at length.

00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:53.940
We actually identified a
different place in the building.

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:58.860
The problem with the building
itself is a lack of controls,

00:50:58.860 --> 00:51:01.280
but the part that we
visited seemed to be dry,

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:04.810
but again they were locked rooms
right, a series of locked rooms.

00:51:04.810 --> 00:51:08.410
But we talked about
actually putting a fume hood,

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:11.740
a new fume hood in this place
and using that as a staging area

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:16.470
and then keeping the books
in that part of the library.

00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:19.750
There was a hesitation
to jump ahead

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:23.740
and not cure the mold problem
in the basement for fear

00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:26.520
that it would not be cured and
that the building would remain

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:29.720
so unhealthy and that it
would affect the people.

00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:32.260
But I think it's a
very real possibility

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:33.560
and I think the director

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:36.800
of the library really
wanted the books treated

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:39.280
because they're valuable books.

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:42.270
So, it's completely possible
to actually move the books

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:46.370
to a dry space, rehab the space
so that it would be safe to work

00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:51.130
in to eliminate the mold,
and leave those rooms moldy.

00:51:51.130 --> 00:51:53.030
But there is a hesitation

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:56.560
about whether they would then
just be forgotten as like moldy,

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:59.760
you know, and maybe the
CDC would then be happy

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.320
that they're growing,
they're still going nicely

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:05.670
as a study so.

00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:06.970
Please.

00:52:06.970 --> 00:52:08.270
&gt;&gt; These are [inaudible],

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:20.330
not indigenous culture heritage
they were actively collected

00:52:20.330 --> 00:52:21.630
and [inaudible].

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:24.600
Have they thought about
pragmatically going

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:31.880
through what they have, if they
had any, this is what they have,

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:38.130
cleaning up and selling some
to fund the work [inaudible]?

00:52:38.130 --> 00:52:40.950
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman:
That's interesting yeah.

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:44.210
We didn't really talk, I think
there's a desire to keep them

00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:46.310
because of their value,
but I think the idea --

00:52:46.310 --> 00:52:49.170
I will pass it along,
the idea of cleaning them

00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:50.470
and selling them to be able

00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:52.540
to clean the building
is interesting.

00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:56.440
They're not indigenous
books, they are, you know,

00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:00.180
they're I think of interest
because they are not in Georgian

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:02.840
or Russian, but actually
Latin books.

00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:07.110
And I think it's a
very interesting idea

00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:08.920
because there's a
real lack of money.

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:11.840
The other cultural problem is

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:16.990
that you know f A plus B does
not necessarily get us to see.

00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:19.440
In effect, it might
be that if we figured

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:22.320
out that they were valuable
and started to sell them

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:24.800
that the money might not come
back to the library anyway,

00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:27.290
that the priorities
are still greater.

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:29.690
And we don't know what they are,
they could be health issues,

00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:32.400
they could be human
issues that you

00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:36.030
and I would probably agree they
are the most important issues.

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:39.730
So, I think it's just a time
in the history of this project

00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:43.320
that it's not particularly
going to work.

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:44.620
Yeah.

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:45.920
&gt;&gt; And a related note.

00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.220
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman: Yes.

00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:48.520
&gt;&gt; You said they were
originally in Germany,

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:51.160
do you know anything
[inaudible]?

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:54.130
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman: I don't
I actually was told Germany

00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:57.650
as a generic, I tried
to press a little bit

00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:59.510
and I didn't get any
information about that.

00:53:59.510 --> 00:54:03.380
I don't know which library they
were dealing with or which group

00:54:03.380 --> 00:54:06.950
of people, you know,
were the Germans,

00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:09.730
but the Germans were very
generous in trying to deal

00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:12.350
with the problem but there
was a lot of difficulty.

00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:14.280
And so, there were
people getting involved.

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:17.340
What's been wonderful is I have
not met anybody who's aware

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:20.220
of this problem who
wasn't willing to you know,

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:23.570
give of themselves to try
and help make it better and.

00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:27.500
&gt;&gt; I was just wondering
if [inaudible]?

00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:29.620
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman:
So, the question is

00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:31.980
where were those original books,

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:33.820
where were they housed
in Germany.

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:37.860
I don't know that, I
don't know that sorry.

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:40.860
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: One
question from offsite.

00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:45.170
Are there preservation
service programs in Georgia?

00:54:45.170 --> 00:54:46.470
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman: The question

00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:49.460
from offsite is are there
preservation service programs

00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:50.760
in Georgia.

00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:53.700
The program is basically Menana,

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:58.590
this Georgian Blue Shield
is a very active group

00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:01.800
and they've had a series of
disaster training workshops

00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:06.730
that I'm aware of and they
are trying to coordinate,

00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:09.600
but I don't know that
there's very much funding

00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:11.040
to support these things.

00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.130
I'm very proud of the
work that they've done.

00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:15.510
And the kinds of
cultural property you know

00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:20.420
when I show you these European
books it pales compared

00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:21.910
to the Georgia books
I was shown,

00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:24.710
I was shown some
astounding stuff,

00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:26.990
amazing things, really gorgeous.

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:30.010
There's great cultural
property there to be cared for

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:32.410
and people are concerned.

00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:35.250
I saw another hand, where?

00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:45.500
&gt;&gt; This just on one of
the slides [inaudible]?

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.510
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman:
A series of stamps.

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:55.050
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:55:55.050 --> 00:55:57.260
Stadsbibliotek was identified

00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:00.110
as maybe what the stamp
said inside the book.

00:56:00.110 --> 00:56:01.410
I've actually not
looked closely,

00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:03.560
but I think that's true.

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:09.330
So, you know, the Germans tried
to help make the problem better,

00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:11.830
they really did and I think
they would've been happy

00:56:11.830 --> 00:56:16.380
to take the books back at one
point, but too much red tape.

00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.000
Yasmine.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.980
&gt;&gt; You went into the space also,

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:29.590
how do the library
staff access the space,

00:56:29.590 --> 00:56:30.890
do they use the books,
what is [inaudible]?

00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:32.190
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman:
So, the question

00:56:32.190 --> 00:56:38.350
from Yasmine is what does
the library staff do relative

00:56:38.350 --> 00:56:40.230
to going in and out
of that space

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:43.730
and how are they using
the books currently.

00:56:43.730 --> 00:56:46.070
I was shocked to
see some people,

00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:50.020
I mean I made it a big part of
my report I didn't note this.

00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:51.760
But anyone going in there,

00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:54.530
I mean it's the most severe
mold outbreak I've seen

00:56:54.530 --> 00:56:56.290
and anyone going in there needs

00:56:56.290 --> 00:56:58.470
to have personal
protection equipment.

00:56:58.470 --> 00:57:00.930
But the person with the
key for instance thought

00:57:00.930 --> 00:57:02.710
that was hooey she didn't care,

00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:06.250
it was like a ridiculous
you know Western attitude,

00:57:06.250 --> 00:57:09.580
what was I bringing to the
problem, what was I thinking.

00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:13.910
I was you know obviously and
she did wander in and out

00:57:13.910 --> 00:57:15.740
of it, I mean and others.

00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:20.490
So, I know there are people
who react differently to mold

00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:24.820
and she was hardy,
there's no question.

00:57:24.820 --> 00:57:28.690
There are people in the
library, so the answer

00:57:28.690 --> 00:57:31.360
to the book question,
they're not using the books

00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:35.230
and there's a little effort
to vacuum off the mold

00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:37.930
and so we went through that
protocol, but it's very slow.

00:57:37.930 --> 00:57:41.330
These are 80,000 books,
so it's a slow process

00:57:41.330 --> 00:57:43.700
and they were trying to
vacuum every single page.

00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:45.430
I suggested we focus just

00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:48.730
on the exterior mold
and let it be enough.

00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:50.760
It's a question you
know what's enough.

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:54.790
But the people in the library
is a really interesting question

00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:59.400
because one person who was
doing digital scanning got sick

00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:01.990
and so he went to the doctor

00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:07.370
and the doctor said you
have a respiratory thing,

00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:10.620
take this whatever
this was, and don't do

00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:12.380
that work for three weeks.

00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:15.480
And so, he came back to work,
but kind of was not working

00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:18.700
and I said well do I mind
if I use you as an example

00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:20.940
to plead the case that there
are health problems here

00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:23.060
and he said oh that'll be fine.

00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:24.710
And then he thought
about it overnight

00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:29.190
and he said tomorrow said no
way, don't do that because

00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:30.490
and he left it at that.

00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:33.870
But others explained to me
that if you put your job

00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:36.100
in jeopardy you might
never get another job

00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:39.320
and that there were young
people caring for their parents

00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:42.160
and their parents at
home were in their 40's

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:44.010
and they were essentially
retired

00:58:44.010 --> 00:58:46.530
out because there
were limited jobs.

00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:50.460
So, people are not willing to
openly say we have a problem

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:54.850
because there's consequences so.

00:58:54.850 --> 00:58:56.630
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: We have
a couple more questions

00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:58.430
from offsite, they're
quite long ones.

00:58:58.430 --> 00:58:59.860
Do you want to speak?

00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:01.160
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: Let me just.

00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:02.460
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman:
Yeah, just say it.

00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:03.760
&gt;&gt; Fenella France:
So, one question is,

00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:05.930
would there be a problem
from a health standpoint

00:59:05.930 --> 00:59:07.230
for future access

00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:10.780
of the collection post-mold
cleaning due to the scale

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:13.280
of the problems, so it's
a wee bit supposition.

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:17.890
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman: Yes, good
for you, that's a great question

00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:22.980
and it enters in an area that we
don't really know definitively

00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:24.580
how to define.

00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:27.930
For cost reasons
it's fair to assume

00:59:27.930 --> 00:59:31.830
that just removing the mold on
the books is probably the extent

00:59:31.830 --> 00:59:33.890
of the treatment that
would be possible.

00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:36.050
One of the hesitations
to doing that

00:59:36.050 --> 00:59:38.190
and then putting the books
back in the storage place

00:59:38.190 --> 00:59:42.950
in the building is it's maybe
not environmentally dry enough

00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:46.730
for us to get away with
just having vacuumed it off.

00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:51.200
But we could monitor them and
we could monitor the Rh in rooms

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:53.980
that they chose to
house them in.

00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:57.740
And if things were improved
or kept to a minimum,

00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:03.840
basically the number we think of
is below 65% relative humidity,

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.310
we're probably going
to be all right.

01:00:06.310 --> 01:00:10.580
But the question you know
if you're probing me to say

01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:14.990
if a person was really sensitive
to molds and the people who are

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:19.360
for instance have just had
children, they've given birth,

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:23.940
they have immune deficiency
problems, they've had surgery,

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:29.870
they have AIDS, that category of
person tends to get a reaction

01:00:29.870 --> 01:00:32.960
to mold more easily than say me.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:36.720
And that being the case, it
would be difficult to say

01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:40.060
that for everyone just having
vacuumed off the mold will

01:00:40.060 --> 01:00:41.360
be enough.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:45.280
I think so, however, I feel
pretty good about that saying

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.650
that would be a solution in
most cases, but I'd really

01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:54.080
like to see ventilation, outdoor
air coming into a building

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.300
that had this kind of problem.

01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.680
I was involved, if I could
just say, I was involved

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:03.210
in a different disaster in 1997
at Colorado State University

01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:05.670
and because of that
very thing every book

01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:09.480
that was damaged, it
was 450,000 books.

01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:13.560
Got a little slip inside it that
said this is a copy of a book

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.750
that was in that flood and
so it's like a heads up.

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:20.160
This space because it was an
entire floor of the building,

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:24.440
this space in theory is maybe
different and maybe you should.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:29.790
I suggested to the university it
would be wise to just post that.

01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:31.220
&gt;&gt; Fenella France:
One more [inaudible].

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.520
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman: Sure.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.020
&gt;&gt; Fenella France: What
was the interest or buy-in

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:37.490
for the community to
support the stabilization

01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:43.250
and conservation of
the books on site?

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:45.090
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman: I don't
think the community generally

01:01:45.090 --> 01:01:47.680
knows about this
book collection,

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:51.610
so I don't know what the
status of that information is.

01:01:51.610 --> 01:01:54.820
But when I told people of
course everybody is sympathetic

01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:57.400
to the idea that we
should fix this problem.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:01.400
But I don't think it was widely
known that there are books

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.570
and certainly not
in that condition.

01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:07.870
And I would think for instance
when the Center for Disease

01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:10.940
and Health from Georgia
got involved

01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:13.620
that they would've been kind of
shocked by things and the fact

01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:17.820
that they weren't makes me think
there's a different standard

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:21.470
than I'm aware of at play.

01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.260
One and two good.

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:28.670
Hi, hi Nora.

01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:36.750
&gt;&gt; Hi, could you tell us
how you got CDC involved

01:02:36.750 --> 01:02:38.550
and the [inaudible]?

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:39.850
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman: It's
a wonderful question,

01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:41.150
so Nora [inaudible] asked

01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:46.770
when did I get the CDC
involved, how smart am I.

01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:50.490
The question actually is it's
a really interesting answer.

01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:54.050
I left Georgia on a plane
like some, you know,

01:02:54.050 --> 01:02:55.950
five in the morning
kind of flight

01:02:55.950 --> 01:03:01.690
out of you know small countries
and I was so frustrated,

01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:05.110
I knew we didn't quite get
there and I was desperate.

01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:07.660
And so, I was talking
to my seatmate,

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:10.920
a woman sat down one seat
over and we talked all the way

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.370
to Germany who was from the CDC.

01:03:13.370 --> 01:03:18.340
You know there is
goodness and mercy

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:21.100
in the world, but it's hiding.

01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:24.120
But she sat down
and she connected,

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.180
I told her how desperate
the situation was

01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:29.680
and she connected me with people
in Atlanta who connected me

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:34.040
with specialists in West
Virginia who deal with mold.

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:37.490
And so, it was by
virtue of serendipity,

01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:40.050
a great research tool.

01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:42.840
Andrew.

01:03:42.840 --> 01:03:44.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I'm thinking
now about the ventilation

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.780
and the shafts to
the king's tomb and.

01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:48.080
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman:
There you go.

01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:50.030
&gt;&gt; And clearly that
was planned out ahead

01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:52.930
of time you know for
whatever reasons.

01:03:52.930 --> 01:03:56.840
Are there anyone that you know

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:59.290
of [inaudible] planning
these kinds of things

01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:02.910
into future building
designs for libraries,

01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:05.060
for cultural heritage
divisions to say let's put

01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:06.670
in an architectural gallery,

01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:09.930
let's put in an [inaudible]
system that we can hook

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:14.460
up to any interior space
in the building as we need

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:16.260
to do this kind of thing?

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:17.560
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman: So.

01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.210
Andrew is asking for
those of you at home,

01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:23.670
you know the king's
ventilation shafts,

01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:29.880
the pyramidal ventilation
shafts is such an ideal use

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:34.190
of existing technology that
it leaves me stunned frankly.

01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:37.270
And you're observing
that there's a real merit

01:04:37.270 --> 01:04:41.520
in capturing ideas like
that and applying them

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:45.630
in the present day is
absolutely a theme I have going

01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:46.930
in the back of my head.

01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:48.790
What do we know that
we've forgotten right,

01:04:48.790 --> 01:04:54.780
what as a culture have we like
eliminated for whatever reason

01:04:54.780 --> 01:04:56.610
and simply overlooked
at this point.

01:04:56.610 --> 01:04:59.030
Because when I found
those shafts just looking

01:04:59.030 --> 01:05:01.870
through literature I was
shocked, it was like look

01:05:01.870 --> 01:05:04.460
at what they thought
of back then.

01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:07.060
And Andrew asked are thinking

01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:09.950
about applying those
in modern buildings.

01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:12.770
I don't know enough about
architecture, this is a --

01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:15.430
I'm out of my depth,
but there are people,

01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:18.010
especially planning
conservation environments

01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.020
who know an awful
lot about this.

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:22.500
But what you're leading
to is a very key point

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.720
and then I probably
have to wrap up.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:28.060
But the idea that if
we build buildings

01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:29.480
that are hermetically sealed

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:33.710
because we can do HVAC
control that's great as long

01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:35.360
as it's working and the day

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:38.540
that it's not working we don't
have a second option right.

01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:41.890
It's a completely sealed system
on purpose, which puts us

01:05:41.890 --> 01:05:46.270
at a huge disadvantage and or
when there's something wrong

01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:48.840
in the building, it's just
a little out of whack.

01:05:48.840 --> 01:05:51.970
Getting to a place that we
could ventilate the book storage

01:05:51.970 --> 01:05:54.570
in Georgia was going to be
difficult, we would have

01:05:54.570 --> 01:05:56.960
to ventilate upstairs and out.

01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:01.320
You'd have to have a mile of the
tubing and or cut a hole right

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.760
through the wall, which I
doubt they were interested

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.280
in doing below-grade.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:10.250
So, when we build modern
buildings are we thinking

01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:11.550
this way.

01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:14.190
I think there's a group
of people who are aware

01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:17.310
of this stuff, but we should be
harvesting and I'll leave this

01:06:17.310 --> 01:06:21.430
at the last note, we should
be harvesting the bright ideas

01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:25.020
in every way that we can and
some of them are ancient.

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:27.110
And to ignore these old ideas

01:06:27.110 --> 01:06:30.420
because they're outdated is
not really paying attention.

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:33.620
When we get into a fix and
we're desperate for an answer,

01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:36.260
when we start clutching
at straws and we come

01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:39.680
across something like this we
should be talking to each other,

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:43.090
we should be harvesting
these ideas because it's not

01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:48.680
out of its own time now, it's
still time for us to come

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:51.370
up with alternatives
and variations

01:06:51.370 --> 01:06:53.910
on the way we're
approaching things.

01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:56.150
&gt;&gt; Can I ask a final question?

01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:57.450
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman: Yes, I
would love one more question.

01:06:57.450 --> 01:06:59.480
&gt;&gt; Just to return to
the university library.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:03.340
Obviously, they're operating
on a different reality,

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:09.570
but despite that were there
any lessons learned for you

01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:10.870
that you could share with us?

01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:16.340
If you had to do it again, would
you do anything differently

01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:20.280
and [inaudible] forward
to the next time

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:21.580
or are you [inaudible]?

01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:27.620
You know there are going to be
limitations on their reality.

01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:29.600
&gt;&gt; Randy Silverman: Mary Oi
[phonetic] just asked the

01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:33.560
million-dollar question,
what did I learn.

01:07:38.730 --> 01:07:43.960
I approached the problem with a
sense of being able to solve it.

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:49.730
I was so convinced the answer
was intellectually within grasp

01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:55.600
and I was so knocked off center
by my inability to do that.

01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:56.950
And the thing I would
like to share

01:07:56.950 --> 01:08:00.570
with you is we can
know how to fix it

01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:03.720
and we can still not
be able to fix it.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:08.860
It's a terrible position to
be in, it's really terrible

01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:12.330
and you know what it's like
a combination of things.

01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:17.340
But in answer to your question,
I failed pure and simple.

01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:26.480
I don't know that I could
have won, I don't know how.

01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:29.850
I begged the people on
the ground you know six

01:08:29.850 --> 01:08:33.300
and eight months later to tell
me how I could've done better

01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:37.250
and they said you did fine,
you know, what are they going

01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:38.620
to say, they're going
to insult me

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:40.960
and tell me what an
idiot I am, I doubt it.

01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:45.080
But I have to say I
think they were sincere

01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:47.570
and I think all we
can do is try,

01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:49.910
I think the best
we can do is try.

01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:54.160
And the idea of harvesting
old ideas that still are valid

01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:56.540
or looking more carefully
at things

01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.560
that we have rejected
along the way

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.920
so that I can bring
a cheap answer.

01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:03.870
The answer was cheap, if I
could have just found a way

01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:05.170
to do it for free.

01:09:05.170 --> 01:09:08.710
I was conning people into, you
know, goading people into coming

01:09:08.710 --> 01:09:12.440
for nothing if they would just
show up on site and ventilate

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:15.150
that room appropriately so
it wasn't a health risk,

01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:18.650
I had a man committed to doing
several trips if he had to,

01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:21.370
to work for nothing
to make this better,

01:09:21.370 --> 01:09:24.380
and there was not
money to do that.

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:32.470
So unfortunately, I'm actually
having to swallow the raw pill

01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:36.740
that it's not possible in
every case to fix these things

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:41.590
and we all live with failures
in little ways all of the time,

01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:47.700
it's humbling, it's frustrating,
and we can do better.

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:51.340
I would hate to say, to leave
this on a negative note,

01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:56.110
but optimism is not necessarily
going to be able to fix it.

01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:58.510
So, thank you very much.
