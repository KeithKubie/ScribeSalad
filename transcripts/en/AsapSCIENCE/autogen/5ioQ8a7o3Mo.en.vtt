00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.660
 Despite being an amazing but almost universal phenomenon 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.740
 There are still many speculations about the role and value of orgasm here. 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.580
 But which is better for the climax of what we know about women and men? 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.960
 Female orgasm is longer than men, probably lasting 20 seconds or more 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.660
 But most men last for three to five seconds. 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.520
 But men will have more orgasms 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.120
 In the Australian National Survey, heterosexual sex investigators found that male orgasm would last for 95% of the time. 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.300
 When women only lasted for 69% 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.560
 In any case, the climax may not have much to do with gender. 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.580
 A greater relationship with it is the type of sex 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.920
 For example, a study by a single American from the age of 21 to 26 found 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.480
 The orgasm ratio of straight men and men is similar. 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.460
 The ratio of female orgasm is clearly related to sexual orientation 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.700
 Sexually, females have a 20% climax 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.080
 Twenty-five percent of lesbians say 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.240
 They will climax every time they experience 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.360
 Almost half said they climaxed 75 percent of the time 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.520
 This may be related to the length of sexual contact 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.040
 When the lesbian couple reports an average length of thirty to forty-five minutes 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.100
 In contrast, the average length of a straight girl is fifteen to thirty minutes. 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600
 Other explanations for genes 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.140
 A study on the discovery of female twins 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.320
 Genes predict the possibility of one-third of female orgasms 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 So how to explain the continuation of the climax 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.840
 University students let men and women describe a climax 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.680
 Then extract two specific words related to the genitals 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.780
 This finds that there are only a few distinguishable differences between sexes 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.500
 Regardless of your gender 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.720
 The brain stimulates blood flow to the genitals and accelerates breathing 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.480
 When pets show significant differences in exercise patterns in sexual arousal 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.480
 Brain activity at the climax is the same as that of men and women 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.380
 The area of ​​the lateral forehead brain area that controls self-assessment will be closed 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.460
 All genders will be closed 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.040
 This makes it difficult to lose control at the climax 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.440
 Similarity is that people will feel tired after the climax 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.540
 Due to a surge in sleep prolactin 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.760
 Interestingly, four times prolactin is released after sexual intercourse. 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.020
 Meet orgasm and masturbation 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.600
 Means you won't feel tired when masturbating 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.160
 We used to think that spontaneous climax is sleeping 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.200
 At the same time, I think that spring dreams are only for men. 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.580
 An academic survey indicates 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.080
 37% of women have had a night climax 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.280
 Thirty percent have had a night climax in the past few years 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.740
 Multiple orgasms, one is considered a woman to have a phenomenon 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.140
 Because of their tolerance during menstruation 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.740
 Usually no male orgasm cumshot occurs at the same time 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.700
 Studies have shown that men can climax without ejaculation 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.040
 Ejaculation can be before or after climax 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.180
 The sharing of this climactic experience makes it more rational from an evolutionary perspective 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.500
 Just like when you see a person crying and feeling sad for him 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.940
 Because you understand observation or as part of your partner's climax can enhance your desires and your own experience. 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.320
 If we have completely different climax 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.920
 Then the same connection will not have 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.820
 End of the day 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:10.340
 Sexual excitement between men and women 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.480
 The main difference is that the climax experience is more like the difference to the individual level. 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.980
 Physiological anatomy and psychology have played a big role 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.060
 Understand your body and optimize your experience 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.020
