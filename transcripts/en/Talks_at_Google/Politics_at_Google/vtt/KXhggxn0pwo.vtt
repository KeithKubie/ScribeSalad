00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.430
RICHARD GINGRAS: Well, thank
you for joining us today.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.520
I'm Richard Gingras with our
eminent guest, Marty Baron.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:18.530
So thank you for joining us,
those here and on the GVC.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.240
Marty Baron, I think
you probably all

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.560
know to some extent.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.170
I'll just give you a
little bit more background.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.140
I didn't dig up anything
interesting is the truth.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.280
I'm disappointed in my
reportorial abilities

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.870
in that regard.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.387
Marty has basically
spent his career

00:00:35.387 --> 00:00:36.470
in the newspaper business.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:39.905
He's worked for basically
all the major national papers

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:40.780
in the United States.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.460
You worked for the "LA
Times," "Boston Globe,"

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.187
"Washington Post," "New
York Times," "Miami Herald."

00:00:47.187 --> 00:00:48.770
You were editor of
the "Miami Herald."

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.680
That was your first editor
gig, was the "Miami Herald."

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.220
Then Marty went on
to the "Boston Globe"

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.170
from what was it?

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.670
2002 to--

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:58.550
MARTY BARON: 2001.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.667
RICHARD GINGRAS: 2001 to 2012,
where, among other things

00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:04.250
that were accomplished
at the "Globe,"

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.500
was the large expose of sex
abuse in the Catholic church

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.750
of the archdiocese of Boston,
which the "Globe" obviously

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.770
led and won Pulitzers
for and got you

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.980
to the point of being portrayed
by Liev Schreiber in the movie,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.920
"Spotlight."

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.200
So congratulations on that.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.040
MARTY BARON: Thanks.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.720
Thanks.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.761
RICHARD GINGRAS: You've
dined off that one a bit,

00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:30.320
I'm sure, the last two years.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.736
MARTY BARON: Well,
I appreciate it

00:01:31.736 --> 00:01:33.440
when people think
of him instead of--

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.080
his image comes up instead of
mine when they hear my name.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.705
It's all right.

00:01:36.705 --> 00:01:42.260
He's better looking,
more fit, and that's fine

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.219
if they think of him.

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.010
RICHARD GINGRAS: When
I meet at the "Post,"

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.680
I would often refer to
him as Liev and not Marty,

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.910
just to stump things a bit.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.660
And then, of course, came
to the "Post" in 2012.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.460
So it's obviously
been a great run,

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.040
and I would suggest-- in
fact, you admitted to me this

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.290
recently-- that the current
administration is likely

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.449
the most fascinating
story you will

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:12.740
have covered in your career.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.170
I, personally, was not
going to load this up

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.040
with political questions,
but I did have one.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.580
And I'm sure others
might have others.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.830
Obviously, this
administration seems

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.150
to be different in more ways
than anyone can get comfortable

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.690
with, whether it
be Trump's ability

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.490
to go direct to the
people via Twitter,

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.640
his significant attacks
of the Fourth Estate,

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.651
so on and so forth.

00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:47.900
Now, I know you've said that--

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.680
your answer to this is you
just do more hard work.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.630
Just do more hard reporting.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.300
But on the other hand, this
is a different environment.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.380
And how has it
changed, if it has

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.180
changed, some of the
approaches that you

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.820
take in reporting stories?

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.344
Do you guide your reporters in
a different way on this story?

00:03:11.344 --> 00:03:12.260
MARTY BARON: Well, no.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.051
I think that we rely
on the same approaches

00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:16.310
that we've always
had, and that is

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.500
that I think at the
core of our profession

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.030
is the process of verification.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.340
We have to find out
what the real facts are,

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.790
what the truth is, and present
them in an honest, honorable,

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.270
fair, and accurate way.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.930
And also, I believe,
an unflinching way.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.000
Tell people directly
and straightforwardly

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.920
what we've found.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.870
This is an
administration that has

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.950
sought to discredit the press,
to marginalize the press,

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.440
to de-legitimize the press.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.810
And I think even to
dehumanize the press,

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.890
with the language of calling us
scum and garbage and the lowest

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:49.930
form of humanity.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.360
And when that wasn't enough, he
said the lowest form of life.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.090
And I thought he had
reached the limit there,

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.650
but then he came out with the
enemy of the American people.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.580
So I don't know what's
next after that one.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.960
But I think that
that's a strategy

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.500
to try to position
us as not being

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.050
an independent arbiter
of facts and truth,

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.780
but to position us as
a political opponent.

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.860
Not just an opponent
of him, but an opponent

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.631
of the American people.

00:04:20.631 --> 00:04:22.089
I think that's
dangerous territory.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:25.490
That's the kind of territory
that authoritarians

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.630
have typically
traveled, and I don't

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.160
think it's helpful to anybody.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.120
What is our response?

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.920
Our response is to
keep doing our jobs.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.390
Try to do them the
way that they're

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.540
supposed to be
done, and continue

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.930
to give the public the
facts that we feel they need

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.670
and deserve to know.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.740
And then we'll see what happens.

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.900
The American people have to
make those kinds of decisions.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.950
But we did that last
week with our look

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.160
at General Flynn, the
National Security Adviser.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.020
We disclosed that
he had not told

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.430
the truth to the
American public,

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.760
nor to the Vice President,
when he said that he had never

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.550
discussed the potential
lifting of sanctions

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.500
with the Russian ambassador
to the United States.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.910
We had nine sources
on that story,

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.800
and we published the story.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.410
And initially, he had actually
denied to us-- when we first

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.660
talked to him, he
denied flatly that he

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.890
had had such a discussion.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.180
And then we waited a
day, and on the next day,

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.630
his spokesman said he'd like
to revise his statement.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.720
He'd like to say that he doesn't
remember whether it came up.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:38.156
So then we published, and
it led to his departure

00:05:38.156 --> 00:05:40.030
from the administration,
which, at first, was

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.660
described as resignation, and
then was described as a firing.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.590
And then the President said--
after the President's spokesman

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.770
said that he was fired,
the President himself

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.870
said that the media had
treated him unfairly.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.140
Now how you reconcile
our treating him unfairly

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:00.560
with the fact that he was fired
by the President, I don't know.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.860
But somehow, they say that.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.230
RICHARD GINGRAS: Well,
interestingly, in a sense,

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:14.080
the attacks that he's making
are beating a very wounded

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.640
horse, as it were.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.590
You've made a point of
saying that the biggest

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:23.690
challenge facing news
organizations today

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.420
isn't the disruption
of the internet,

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.410
isn't the ability
to monetize news,

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.340
as challenging and important
as those questions are,

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.375
that it's really the
decline of trust.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.360
So given that--
and I know you've

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.190
been deeply involved in this.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.800
You've agreed to join
the Trust Project

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.340
effort, which is superb.

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.187
But what do you
think is the answer?

00:06:51.187 --> 00:06:53.020
MARTY BARON: I think,
ultimately, the answer

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.811
is for us to continue
doing our job the way

00:06:54.811 --> 00:06:56.450
that it's supposed to be done.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.110
I know what the answer
is not, and that

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.920
is that it's not our job to
pander to any particular group

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.530
because we think that
that's our constituency.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.410
And it's not our job to
placate any group because we're

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.300
under attack from them.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.940
I think that we have
to be independent.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.770
I don't think that
being independent

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.040
is a hostile act, as the
administration portrays it.

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.870
It's not an act of war.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.930
I've said before we're not at
war with the administration.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.720
We're at work doing our jobs.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.800
And certainly, the
press has suffered

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.810
a decline in confidence.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.270
That's true of pretty much
all major institutions,

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.130
except the military
in the United States.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:39.790
But we've taken a particular
hit, and particularly

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.680
among Republicans,
over the last two years

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.550
when we've been under severe
attack from Donald Trump.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.860
But I think that you
look back in history,

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.280
the press was under attack
during the Watergate

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:52.930
investigation.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:57.160
And at that time,
there was actually

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.410
an ACLU report that
said the press had

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:01.570
gone from a position
of extreme security

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.475
to extreme vulnerability.

00:08:03.475 --> 00:08:05.350
And they were very
concerned about the future

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.016
of the press in that environment
when it was coming under attack

00:08:08.016 --> 00:08:10.480
from the Nixon administration.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.400
Well, it turned out
that the investigation

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.980
of the administration, of
course, led by the "Washington

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.850
Post" in the Watergate
investigation,

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.117
turned out to be true.

00:08:20.117 --> 00:08:22.450
There turned out to be all
sorts of bad things happening

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.660
in that administration,
and ultimately, Nixon

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:26.950
had to leave office.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.100
And confidence in the press
soared to record levels

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:32.289
after that work.

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:37.690
So I think there are rewards
for us in just doing our jobs

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.130
and sticking to our
central purpose.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.950
And that's what, certainly,
we at the "Washington Post"

00:08:42.950 --> 00:08:44.405
intend to do.

00:08:44.405 --> 00:08:46.030
RICHARD GINGRAS:
Let's probe into that.

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:48.070
And you're right.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.840
At least in the United States'
history, trust in the press

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.810
hit pretty much an all-time
high around Watergate,

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.120
but has been declining
pretty steadily since then.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.820
And interestingly,
it didn't drop off

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.020
a cliff with the internet.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.160
It didn't drop off a
cliff two years ago.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.140
It's been on a pretty
steady decline.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.470
And I appreciate you saying that
we just need to do our work.

00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:13.600
I guess the question
I would pose is,

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.630
do people understand your work?

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.160
Do they understand how
you approach your work?

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.310
And is there opportunity
to do things differently

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:22.200
in that regard?

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.700
MARTY BARON: Well, I don't think
people understand our work.

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.070
We have a whole generation,
maybe multiple generations,

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.111
of people who've grown up
essentially not reading

00:09:29.111 --> 00:09:32.560
a newspaper, not
reading or turning

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.700
to other sources of information,
rather than those of us who

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.610
are in what is sometimes
derisively called the MSM,

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.200
or the mainstream media.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.410
And so I don't think people
have an understanding

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:49.240
of how hard it is to do our
work, how much time it takes.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.190
We can't just go
out and, forgive me,

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.700
Google all the information
that we publish.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.140
It's not there.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.210
Bob Woodward, of
Watergate fame, talks

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:02.140
about how he spoke to a class
at a very prominent university

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.400
once and said, how would
you do Watergate now?

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.160
And people said they would
go Google the information.

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:09.990
Well, that information
wasn't available on Google

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.140
until they unearthed it.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.980
And so I don't think that
people understand just how

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.300
difficult it is to do this.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.800
Because now so much information
is available instantly,

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.470
thanks to companies
like this one,

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:27.380
primarily a company
like this one.

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:32.250
But to unearth information
takes a lot more work.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.500
And I think that is a problem.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:37.280
And I worry about
people not understanding

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.010
just how much effort really
needs to go into this.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:41.960
Now, how should we change?

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.280
As we've discussed on
any number of occasions

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:46.970
as part of this Trust
Project, we probably

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.460
need to show more of
our work to people,

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.460
show the original documents,
talk a little bit more

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:57.980
about who we spoke to, almost
in a footnotey kind of way.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.490
That takes time.

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.820
It's typically not--
we haven't invested

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.747
in doing that sort of thing.

00:11:03.747 --> 00:11:05.330
We've certainly
become more accustomed

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.640
these days to putting
original documents up,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.790
to annotating those
documents, things like that.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:13.910
But I would say that it's
a small portion of the work

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.830
that we do, and
it probably needs

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.380
to be a greater portion
of the work that we do.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.940
That we, as news organizations,
need to be more transparent.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.430
Now, that's difficult to do
that in all circumstances.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:29.660
You take the investigation of
General Flynn, for example.

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:33.200
Those were nine confidential
sources and nobody

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.090
there is going to
go on the record

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:36.777
to tell you who they are.

00:11:36.777 --> 00:11:38.360
And we're not putting
it on the record

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.990
because that was the
basis of our agreement.

00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:45.230
And that's how we were
able to obtain the story.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:46.540
And it's all true.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.520
But in other
circumstances, I do think

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.840
that we have a greater freedom
and a greater necessity

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.837
of showing our work more fully.

00:11:57.837 --> 00:11:59.420
RICHARD GINGRAS:
Let's go a little bit

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:03.340
beyond that because it certainly
has been my sense that,

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:08.770
given the dramatically different
ecosystem that we're in,

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:13.270
the massively larger ecosystem
of sources of content

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.340
that might be news,
might not be news,

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.230
and I don't mean that
in a fake news sense.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:21.610
There's Joe Blogger and
there's the "Washington Post."

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:22.900
Vastly different environment.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:26.230
People consume information,
form opinions in different ways,

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:31.240
which, to me, says, does
journalism, in its form

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:35.260
and substance and approach,
need to rethink itself,

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:37.840
given this different context?

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.424
I mean, in a sense,
more dramatically.

00:12:39.424 --> 00:12:40.881
Because one of the
things I look at

00:12:40.881 --> 00:12:42.530
and I see-- you've
got all of those.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:45.622
You've got Joe's blog.

00:12:45.622 --> 00:12:47.860
You've got a news
outlet that might

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.170
be known to be leaning
left and another

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.820
known to be leaning right.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.000
And I go even to an
individual publication,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.220
say, like the "Post," and I
see your fact-based coverage,

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.930
and I see opinion columns,
and I see the editorial page.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:06.380
It leads to a lot
of mixed messages.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.140
Are we at a time
and place when we

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:12.850
need to get even more
structured and rigorous in what

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:18.010
a credible, respected news
institution can or should be?

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:19.600
Not that everyone
will follow that,

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:21.160
but someone needs to start.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.076
MARTY BARON: Well, we're
beginning to do that.

00:13:23.076 --> 00:13:26.020
As you know, we've started
labeling pieces more

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.890
as opinion or analysis
or a review or something

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:33.460
like that to distinguish
them from news.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:37.600
And this became ever more
urgent as so much of our work

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.520
is appearing on a lot
of different platforms.

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.520
And even if we were to
have labeling, let's say,

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.590
in the newspaper, it
didn't become apparent.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:46.900
It wasn't visible on all
these other platforms

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.640
where we were appearing.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.790
So not just on Google,
but on, let's say,

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:56.260
Apple News or on Twitter
or on Facebook or Snapchat

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.070
or wherever we are, and we're
pretty much everywhere--

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:02.700
and that's our desire to
be pretty much everywhere--

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:04.900
is to make sure that
these labels actually

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.530
travel with the story and
are visible, regardless

00:14:08.530 --> 00:14:10.150
of where they're appearing.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.950
And so we've worked
very hard to do that.

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:13.720
So that provides some
level of structure.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:16.030
I'm not suggesting that
that's the total answer,

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:20.680
but it's one step
in the process.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:23.140
AUDIENCE: What role
can and should schools

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:27.910
play in empowering students
to be media literate?

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:29.500
And what does
media literate even

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.620
mean when you go to a middle
school or a high school?

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.430
MARTY BARON: Right.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.388
Well, that's a subject
of great interest to me.

00:14:35.388 --> 00:14:37.690
I'm involved, in
an informal way,

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.270
with something called the
News Literacy Project.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:44.170
And there are others, but that
is a prominent one and one

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:48.880
which I have a great belief
in their mission and the way

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.280
that they're going
about their work.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.920
And that is to help
students really

00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.711
understand how to be
more critical judges

00:14:55.711 --> 00:14:57.460
of the information
that they're receiving,

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.440
to ask the right questions.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.210
And that's all we
can really expect,

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.120
is that people ask the
questions and try to get answers

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.290
to those questions.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:07.840
And to question the
sources that they have

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.844
and what is the
documentation that they have?

00:15:09.844 --> 00:15:11.260
What is the basis
for saying that?

00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.390
Are they providing
actual evidence?

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:15.740
Things of that sort.

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:18.400
So they've now-- they're
starting to scale up.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.690
They have online tutorials.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.460
They're making those available
to teachers at schools

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.170
throughout the country.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.730
Fortunately, they've
been able to get

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:31.060
some additional foundation
support to do that.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.300
But boy, is that a long process
and a difficult process,

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:38.050
and a process that doesn't
have any certain results.

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.010
We'll have to see
how that works.

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:44.720
I'm concerned about what's
happening more immediately

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.980
and how do we deal with that?

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.670
Now, to that, I'm
concerned about it,

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.310
but I don't really have any
answers to it, unfortunately.

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:52.690
I think that's a real--

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.940
we're hoping that maybe
Google can figure out--

00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:58.480
working with us to figure
out how to sort out fact

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:03.820
from fiction and to give more
visibility to things that

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.860
are fact-based as opposed
to those that are not,

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.300
that are outright falsehoods.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.300
It's tricky territory.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:10.870
No question.

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.660
We were having a discussion
earlier today about that.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:16.360
It is not easy to
do, especially when

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:20.710
you're considering free speech
issues and things of that sort.

00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:22.870
But it's a worthy cause.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.270
But certainly, we do
have to think long run

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:26.770
and we do have to
think about what's

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:30.400
being taught in middle schools
and high schools, colleges,

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.600
as well, and maybe for adults.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:39.370
How to be more critical
evaluators of the information

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.170
that they're receiving.

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:42.670
RICHARD GINGRAS:
You're sitting here

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.180
in the home of Google
search, so what would

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:49.050
you suggest that we
do in this regard,

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:52.349
from our product experiences?

00:16:52.349 --> 00:16:54.640
MARTY BARON: Give greater
prominence to the "Washington

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.140
Post."

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.940
I don't know.

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:01.120
Look, obviously,
that's just a joke.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.107
But I--

00:17:02.107 --> 00:17:03.940
RICHARD GINGRAS: And
it's not the first time

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:04.450
that joke has been said.

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:06.366
MARTY BARON: Although
feel free to follow my--

00:17:06.366 --> 00:17:07.324
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:07.324 --> 00:17:08.990
RICHARD GINGRAS: Ezra
Klein, your buddy.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:10.240
MARTY BARON: Well, he
recommended the "Washington

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:10.960
Post," too, I hope.

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.430
RICHARD GINGRAS: He said
the only reason he was here

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.388
was he felt it would get
him more Google juice.

00:17:14.388 --> 00:17:16.060
MARTY BARON: I see.

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:16.790
Good for Ezra.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:23.170
In any event, I don't really
know the answer to that.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:26.290
I think that we've talked
about being more transparent,

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.030
that that should help.

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:29.700
Perhaps that can
actually elevate us

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:32.560
in the world of Google search.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.100
More information about
the writers, who they are,

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.340
how they can be
contacted, things of that

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.420
sort being available to people.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:46.360
Perhaps greater
weight given to people

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.380
who are actually in the region.

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.460
So why shouldn't-- let's
say, if the "Washington Post"

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.870
has a correspondent in Iraq,
who's putting his or her life

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:58.840
at risk to cover what's
happening there and is actually

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.920
providing information back
to the American public

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.810
and the public
throughout the world,

00:18:04.810 --> 00:18:07.720
perhaps be given a bit more
authority than someone who is

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.020
sitting in a television studio,
who's never left the comfort

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:13.900
of a television studio, and
is not witnessing anything

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.940
firsthand.

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:20.410
Now how do you do that, it's
hard to do, hard to evaluate.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:23.080
Because anybody can put
a dateline that says

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.120
they're from somewhere.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.610
And they may or may
not actually be there.

00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.100
There are very few news
organizations, relatively

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:32.440
few news organizations,
that actually have people

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.030
in conflict zones as we do.

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:42.019
But that could be a means
for giving greater weight,

00:18:42.019 --> 00:18:44.560
because there should be greater
trust for people who actually

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:45.762
are eyewitnesses to events.

00:18:45.762 --> 00:18:46.720
RICHARD GINGRAS: Right.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.300
AUDIENCE: What's your
opinion on these third party

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.160
fact-checking organizations
and the approach that Facebook

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.420
has taken, for example, in
trying to farm out, I guess,

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.420
the quality assessments?

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.530
MARTY BARON: Yeah,
what Facebook is doing?

00:18:56.530 --> 00:18:57.020
Right.

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.728
Well, we were invited
to be part of that.

00:18:58.728 --> 00:19:00.500
We decided to wait
and see how it goes.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.460
We have a very substantial
fact-checking organization.

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:05.980
We actually, just yesterday,
posted every fact check

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:11.330
on Donald Trump in the four
weeks since he took office.

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:12.680
There are a lot of fact checks.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:18.760
I think it's interesting.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:20.710
They obviously want
to do something.

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:24.190
I'm all in favor of
people doing something.

00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:26.530
Readers are able to
tag things and say,

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.130
this should be checked.

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:31.000
And then that gets farmed out to
the fact-checking organizations

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.350
and they decide whether
they're going to pick that up.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:36.460
And if they do,
and they question

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:44.430
the veracity of a story, then
that gets flagged in some way.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:46.720
I don't think it covers a
lot of stories out there,

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.110
so I think it's going to
get a very small percentage

00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:53.980
of the falsehoods that
are floating out there.

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.210
But it's a step.

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.295
We'll see how it goes to see
whether we would participate.

00:19:59.295 --> 00:20:01.420
We're a little bit different
from these independent

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.420
fact-checking organizations,
because we're an actual news

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.280
organization.

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:09.400
And I think we--

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.235
it's interesting, as
is often the case,

00:20:11.235 --> 00:20:12.610
it's just a
grievance from people

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:15.250
in the news organization-- is we
would make all the investment.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.291
We would do all the work.

00:20:16.291 --> 00:20:19.090
We would do the risk of being
targeted because of the fact

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:20.890
check that we did.

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:24.250
And outfits like Facebook
would not suffer.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:26.130
They would not do
any of the work,

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:29.290
not make any of the
investment, but would

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:32.470
be able to say that they did
something about this problem.

00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:35.530
Now I don't know that there's
another answer for them.

00:20:35.530 --> 00:20:39.190
So I'm in favor of anything that
we can do that draws attention

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:40.240
to falsehoods.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.460
But it's only going
to get a small--

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.060
it's only going to reach a
small portion of the problem.

00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:48.269
RICHARD GINGRAS: Another
question from a Googler.

00:20:48.269 --> 00:20:49.810
"What are your
thoughts on the future

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.840
of long form and
investigative journalism,

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.340
given the increasing
torrent of content

00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.330
and decreasing attention spans?

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.850
Who will fund it and who,
demographically, will

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:02.612
consume it?"

00:21:02.612 --> 00:21:04.570
MARTY BARON: I actually
think it's pretty good.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.486
I think there's actually
an increased interest

00:21:06.486 --> 00:21:09.040
in investigative reporting.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.580
Certainly, I'm hopeful that
the movie about the Spotlight

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.590
team's investigation
of the Catholic church

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:17.330
created interest in
the general population.

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.390
I've seen a lot of
interest in what we did.

00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:21.310
But more importantly,
I think what's

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:24.430
happened during the election
and subsequent to the election

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:27.670
is that there is an appropriate
demand on major news

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.910
organizations like ours to
do investigative reporting.

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.980
And also for there to be
investigative reporting

00:21:32.980 --> 00:21:37.360
by regional news
organizations, as well.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:40.690
I happen to think that that's
absolutely core to our mission,

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:44.860
that we have, as our central
purpose and our highest

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.660
purpose, holding
powerful institutions

00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.240
and powerful
individuals accountable.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.570
And certainly, that
includes the President

00:21:51.570 --> 00:21:54.070
of the United States, who holds
the top position in the most

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:56.350
powerful country on Earth.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:59.330
But what we should be doing
that across for politicians

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:01.730
and policymakers and other
powerful institutions

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:02.694
that are out there.

00:22:02.694 --> 00:22:04.610
So there's, I think, an
increasing expectation

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:06.800
on the part that news
organizations should be doing

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.650
that work and an
increasing willingness

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:11.960
on the part of people to
actually pay for that.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.930
And we're seeing that in
a surge of subscriptions

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.689
to the "Washington Post,"
and other news organizations

00:22:18.689 --> 00:22:19.730
are seeing that, as well.

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.580
"The New York Times" has
reported the same thing.

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.810
And there these
are people who say,

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.860
I want you to do
this kind of work.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:29.100
I am willing to support you
to do this kind of work.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.016
In fact, I think it's
important that I support

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:33.440
you to do this sort of work
because otherwise, it's

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:34.380
not going to get done.

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.140
And the truth is
it's not going to get

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:41.780
done unless people support
news organizations that do it.

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:46.480
And so we do see that
that kind of reporting,

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.850
that in-depth reporting,
that's investigative

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:53.420
is well-read across the spectrum
by people of all age groups

00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.580
and all demographic groups.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.860
And that is really encouraging.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:02.240
And it gets shared dramatically
through social networks

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.420
and has a very powerful effect.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.040
But it is very expensive.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.540
It's incredibly expensive to do.

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.630
It takes a lot of time.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.580
We're in an
environment and a time

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:16.430
where people expect that they
can get information instantly,

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:20.380
no matter what, on about any
subject, thanks to you guys.

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:24.650
And the truth is,
that is not possible.

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:27.200
Not all information can
be obtained instantly.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.540
There actually is work
that goes into obtaining

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:30.870
that information.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:34.190
And so I think people have to
have an appreciation for how

00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:37.220
much time, how much effort,
how much energy really needs

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:40.400
to go into doing
investigative work,

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.730
and understand that it takes
resources, including money,

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:46.330
to do that.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:49.670
But I do think that there
is a surge of interest

00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:55.190
in investigative reporting
and an increased expectation

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:59.180
that news organizations, like
ours, will do that and do it

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.025
consistently.

00:24:00.025 --> 00:24:01.400
RICHARD GINGRAS:
How carefully do

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:06.620
you study consumption
patterns of your readers,

00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.962
including to the point of, do
they read the full article?

00:24:09.962 --> 00:24:10.920
How do you assess that?

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.050
What are you learning?

00:24:14.274 --> 00:24:16.190
MARTY BARON: We do a
tremendous amount of-- we

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:17.150
have a tremendous
amount of data.

00:24:17.150 --> 00:24:18.960
We have a tremendous
technology team, which

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.870
works closely with Google.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:24.680
And we have a lot of data
about consumption patterns.

00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:28.250
In fact, it's up on a board
in the center of our newsroom.

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:32.520
Not just the traffic, but
also the speed of a site,

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.660
very important.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.960
How deeply people are scrolling
into stories, on average.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:42.920
And we also look at that
across individual stories.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.960
In fact, we're developing,
or have developed,

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.280
a new metric, which
we'll continue to develop

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.159
to judge the value of stories.

00:24:50.159 --> 00:24:51.950
And one of them is,
how deeply into stories

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:53.600
are people actually reading?

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:55.392
So it's really important to us.

00:24:55.392 --> 00:24:57.350
RICHARD GINGRAS: Has that
changed significantly

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:59.090
over the last few years?

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:02.630
Do you see patterns different
between mobile consumption

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:04.529
and desktop consumption?

00:25:04.529 --> 00:25:06.320
MARTY BARON: I don't
know the data on that.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.790
But our latest data
overall is that people

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:12.290
are spending more time on site.

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:14.180
So that's positive.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.610
In terms of scroll depth,
I don't know the answer

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:17.990
to that question.

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:21.680
AUDIENCE: You said
earlier that there are

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.650
rewards in just doing our jobs.

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:26.660
I'm interested in
what that means

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.940
when the job of
journalism is changing

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:33.410
so much with digital
media and the internet.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:36.170
MARTY BARON: Well, I think
there are all sorts of rewards.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:41.750
Look, there are rewards in
terms of how many people

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:42.830
are subscribing to us.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:46.210
When we're seeing an increase
in subscribers, that's one.

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:47.330
And we are.

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:49.700
Traffic-- we've seen
a surge in traffic

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:50.750
to the "Washington Post."

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:54.650
We are well over 100 million
unique visitors per month.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:55.511
We were in November.

00:25:55.511 --> 00:25:57.260
We actually surpassed
"The New York Times"

00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:00.140
for domestic
traffic in November.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:04.500
And that shows tremendous
progress for us.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:11.240
But then there are other
rewards that are different.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.850
And at the time, I was obviously
involved in this movie,

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:16.610
the "Spotlight" thing.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:18.362
And I wrote a piece.

00:26:18.362 --> 00:26:20.570
My colleagues demanded that
I write a piece about it,

00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:21.910
so I did write a piece about it.

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:25.010
And the whole
premise of the piece

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:28.940
was that there are
awards like the Oscars.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:30.920
Fortunately, it won the
Oscar for Best Picture.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.000
But there are rewards.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.460
There are rewards.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.850
And the rewards were
the impact that it

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:40.160
had on ordinary people's lives.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.620
And it had an enormous
impact on people's lives.

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.990
And I was at a
convention of survivors

00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:51.770
of clerical sexual
abuse last year

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.260
and they asked me to be
their keynote speaker.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:57.432
And normally, in
past years, they

00:26:57.432 --> 00:26:58.890
would've had very
few people there.

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.590
But they had 300 people
attending the convention.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:03.900
And person after
person came up to me

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:06.060
to tell me that the
reason that they showed up

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.220
for that convention
was because of the work

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:11.280
that "The Boston
Globe" did and that it

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.780
made an enormous difference.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:14.910
That and the movie
persuaded them

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:18.000
to go public with the abuse
that they had suffered

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.750
and to see it as their
own personal obligation

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:25.470
to hold the church
accountable for its behavior

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:27.570
and not to keep
it secret anymore.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:30.150
That's called a reward,
and setting aside

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:33.210
traffic and subscriptions and
monetization models and all

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:36.960
that stuff, to me, that's
the most important reward.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.725
And it's exactly why
I'm in this business.

00:27:39.725 --> 00:27:41.100
RICHARD GINGRAS:
In a sense, what

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.750
happened there is that
community saw "The Globe"

00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:49.070
and that coverage
as their advocates.

00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:52.560
And interestingly,
you tend to shy away

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.716
from that term in
journalism, of advocacy,

00:27:54.716 --> 00:27:56.340
because it suggests
that somehow you're

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.540
taking a position on things.

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.540
I actually sometimes
wonder whether we shouldn't

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:03.240
go in the other
direction of, how

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.890
do you establish
that relationship

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:07.740
with your community such that
they understand that you are

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.930
advocates for their
interests, problems,

00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:14.320
challenges in the community?

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.780
Particularly given how people
perceive the media today,

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.230
which is basically, you're
just bashing everybody

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:21.030
because you like to
have fun with it.

00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:23.760
MARTY BARON: Yeah, right.

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:24.720
I agree with you.

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.130
I think that, as a
profession, as an industry,

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:29.310
we've done a terrible job
of explaining how we have

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:31.890
been advocates over the years.

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:33.420
Local newspapers
all over the place

00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.010
have done incredible
work, in terms

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:39.180
of bringing to light
environmental dangers,

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:42.810
dangers to public
safety, abuse of power,

00:28:42.810 --> 00:28:46.110
corruption, things like
that, across a whole range.

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:48.105
We don't tend to--

00:28:48.105 --> 00:28:51.750
we give ourselves awards, but
we don't advertise what we did.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:57.520
We don't have an advertising
campaign to talk about it.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.300
And people tend to start
taking that for granted.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.220
And they shouldn't
take it for granted

00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.970
because if they
take it for granted,

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:05.980
it's not going to
happen anymore.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:09.574
And there are politicians at
the local and state level today

00:29:09.574 --> 00:29:11.490
who know that there's
absolutely nobody paying

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:13.710
any attention to what they do.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:16.570
If you go to state houses
across this country,

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:18.810
the major newspaper
in the state,

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:22.020
which is the organization that
has the largest, the greatest

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:25.170
resources for news coverage,
may have only one person

00:29:25.170 --> 00:29:26.340
in the state house.

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.920
And that individual is
in charge of covering

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.770
the governor, both houses
of the legislature,

00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:35.080
all state agencies,
politics, and policy.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:37.950
And now, how that
person can do one bit

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:41.304
of investigative reporting,
it's hard to know.

00:29:41.304 --> 00:29:43.140
It's impossible to do
what they're expected

00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.822
to do and to do it well.

00:29:44.822 --> 00:29:46.530
They do it the best
they can, but they're

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:48.360
completely overloaded.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.600
And so we have-- traditionally,
news organizations,

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:55.410
particularly "legacy" newspapers
that aren't "just newspapers"

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:58.980
anymore, have done
that kind of work

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:01.860
and they have not gotten
the credit for the work

00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.030
that they did.

00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:06.390
And they have been an
advocate for the public.

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:11.700
The notion that people
in this profession

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:15.070
would be described as an
enemy of the American people,

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:18.900
it so dishonors not just
them as individuals,

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:22.710
but the work that they have
done on people's behalf.

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:23.980
I can tell you that--

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:28.290
let's just take the church
investigation, the sexual abuse

00:30:28.290 --> 00:30:29.580
investigation--

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:32.070
the people who were
survivors of sex abuse,

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:34.710
they did not view the
investigative team

00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:37.770
at "The Boston Globe" as an
enemy of the American people,

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:38.640
as their enemy.

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.110
They viewed them
as their advocate

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:42.526
and they're very grateful that
they did the work they did.

00:30:42.526 --> 00:30:43.650
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:30:43.650 --> 00:30:46.860
You mentioned earlier
moving towards trying

00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:50.430
to footnote more and provide
source documentation to provide

00:30:50.430 --> 00:30:55.170
more clarity into what went into
the investigative reporting.

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.450
To what end, or
what does that do

00:30:57.450 --> 00:31:01.500
for you and for the paper,
in the sense that people that

00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:06.480
don't already, I guess,
understand or believe

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.430
that what you've
report was correct,

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:10.320
are they actually
going to go and look

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:13.160
at the footnote and the source?

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.960
RICHARD GINGRAS: Can
I jump in on that?

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.730
To me, here's why
I think it matters.

00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:21.290
It's not whether you
look at the footnote.

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:24.180
The comparison I would make is
you go read an academic article

00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.570
in an academic journal and
you see the peer review

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:29.640
and you see all the
footnotes and so on.

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.120
You get a different sense
of the amount of seriousness

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.490
that went into that effort.

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:37.340
I think it's just about that.

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:39.340
It's not whether I delve
into the footnotes.

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.630
But does the very presence
of the footnotes or artifacts

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:45.200
of the effort that
went into the story

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.820
an important message in itself?

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:49.230
Feel free to disagree.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:51.420
MARTY BARON: Well,
I agree, but it's--

00:31:51.420 --> 00:31:55.740
well, I agree, and Richard
pressured me on this issue.

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.800
But I think there's merit in it.

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.390
And I think that,
look, not everybody

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:00.890
is going to read
every story and not

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:02.420
everybody is going to
read every footnote.

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:03.770
And that's just the way it is.

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:06.754
Not everybody does
a lot of things.

00:32:06.754 --> 00:32:09.170
But for the people who want
to, who feel that they should,

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:12.470
then why would we not
make that available?

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:17.500
And if we can, why not do it?

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.250
I'll take this occasion
to mention that we

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:21.350
use annotations on documents.

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:26.070
And so we use Genius, actually.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:31.580
And so here's this thing, and
it was created to annotate rap

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:35.000
and we use it to annotate Donald
Trump's press conferences.

00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:41.030
But it doesn't
work on Google AMP.

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:44.021
And so you got to work on that.

00:32:44.021 --> 00:32:45.860
It would be really
helpful if this thing

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:46.790
worked on Google AMP.

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:47.873
RICHARD GINGRAS: So noted.

00:32:47.873 --> 00:32:49.644
MARTY BARON: OK.

00:32:49.644 --> 00:32:52.310
AUDIENCE: You had spoken earlier
that you guys have incorporated

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:53.640
a lot of data.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.560
So I wanted to know, especially,
what role that has in

00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.610
affecting what's being
put out on the front page,

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:06.200
especially in the
editorial department.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.360
Are you guys, as
editors, drawing a line

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:12.510
from AB testing to not
go towards clickbait?

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:17.870
And also prioritizing news,
especially longer issues that

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:21.300
aren't quite sensational
anymore like Fukushima or Flint

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.640
or things like that?

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.030
How are you drawing
that balance,

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:26.060
and how are you prioritizing?

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:29.421
Are you victims towards
marketing and advertising for--

00:33:29.421 --> 00:33:30.170
MARTY BARON: Yeah.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:31.460
No, we don't.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:34.290
We make our news decisions
based on our editorial judgments

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:35.750
and our experience.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:37.790
Look, we have a brand.

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:39.800
We have an identity.

00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.960
We can't do anything that
undermines that brand.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.027
If we were to revert
to just clickbait,

00:33:44.027 --> 00:33:45.860
then people would say,
the "Washington Post"

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.710
isn't what the
"Washington Post" is.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:51.920
That is not a successful
business strategy for us.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:57.380
We do want to understand, what
are the qualities of the story?

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.760
Which ones actually succeeded?

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:02.210
We do want to reward people
who are producing stories

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:06.080
that might actually do well,
let's say, in terms of traffic.

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:10.340
Because that's just
part of who we are now.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:13.517
We also-- for example,
we use data to--

00:34:13.517 --> 00:34:15.350
one of the things that
we're doing right now

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:17.389
is trying to anticipate
which stories

00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:20.150
are likely to be popular to
look at momentum indicators

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:21.260
and things like that.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:22.551
And what's the purpose of that?

00:34:22.551 --> 00:34:25.159
The purpose is, did we
build that story out?

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:27.763
We can't always anticipate which
story is going to be popular.

00:34:27.763 --> 00:34:29.929
Have we built that story
out the way that we should?

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:31.909
Are there interstitial
links in there?

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:33.894
Are there other elements?

00:34:33.894 --> 00:34:37.029
How have we--
what's the best way

00:34:37.029 --> 00:34:39.320
to build that story out so
that somebody might actually

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.969
click on another story?

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:43.210
We also have a big data team--

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:44.659
it's not my area--

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:48.170
but a big data team that works
on the recommended stories

00:34:48.170 --> 00:34:50.780
after you've read a story.

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.719
They're the ones who come up
with the recommended stories

00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:55.639
based on reading patterns.

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:59.870
And basically, we took the
humans out of the picture

00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:04.730
and they use whatever
algorithm it is and they

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:05.990
present the stories.

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:07.790
And it's improved
our performance.

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:10.280
We actually can anticipate
what people want to read better

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.117
than a human can.

00:35:11.117 --> 00:35:13.700
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much for
coming to speak with us today.

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.110
It's been great.

00:35:15.110 --> 00:35:18.080
And it's been really encouraging
to see how subscriptions

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.820
have surged at the "Post."

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.520
Hiring for investigative
journalists has also gone up.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.080
And I guess my
question is more about

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.060
reaching Trump supporters.

00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:28.610
You saw John Oliver
about two weeks ago.

00:35:28.610 --> 00:35:32.579
He bought ad time on Fox to
reach Trump and his supporters.

00:35:32.579 --> 00:35:34.370
And I just was wondering,
does the "Post--"

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.786
maybe not as blatant-- but
does the "Post" have a strategy

00:35:36.786 --> 00:35:40.730
to reach his supporters in the
areas where they consume news?

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:44.060
Not necessarily on Fox, but
just a strategy in general?

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:47.912
MARTY BARON: We don't really
have a strategy for that.

00:35:47.912 --> 00:35:49.370
The reality is that
there are a lot

00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:51.980
of Trump supporters who read
us, if only to criticize us.

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:55.210
So that's OK.

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:57.080
And there are a lot
of conservative sites

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.290
that actually pick
up our stories.

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:02.540
Drudge is a big driver
of traffic and they

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.130
pick up our stories
all the time,

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:08.060
the ones that conform to
their particular worldview.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:10.640
So they are reading us.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:13.710
We have a wide variety of
opinion people, as well.

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:17.150
And we have, in a
very determined way,

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:20.592
sought out people who have
opinions that are more in line

00:36:20.592 --> 00:36:22.800
with Trump so that we have
a wide variety of opinion.

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:25.850
We have people across the
spectrum, as I think we should.

00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:31.940
So that's really
what we're doing.

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:36.140
And we also, very
systematically,

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:38.990
are talking to Trump supporters
to hear their voices.

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:41.930
So a couple of weeks
into the administration,

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:45.440
we went out to a rural area in
Maryland, which is generally

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.375
Democratic, but it is now.

00:36:47.375 --> 00:36:48.250
It didn't used to be.

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:52.130
But rural Maryland, where
it was a center of Trump

00:36:52.130 --> 00:36:55.170
support, to listen to
what they had to say.

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:58.010
And what they had to say was
quite different from what

00:36:58.010 --> 00:36:59.780
you might hear elsewhere.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:02.870
In fact, Trump himself
read the piece.

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:06.800
He wrote a note to the
reporter on the story.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.350
Somebody must have taken
a picture of what he wrote

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:11.210
and then he sent
it to the reporter

00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:14.090
and thanked her for
doing this story.

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:16.160
And I told her, by the
way, that autograph's not

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.576
worth anything
unless he sends you

00:37:17.576 --> 00:37:20.200
the original piece of paper.

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:26.970
And then when he did his
rally in Florida, afterwards,

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:29.570
we talked to the people
there and gave voice

00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:32.190
to their point of view,
which I think we should.

00:37:32.190 --> 00:37:35.060
These are all American
citizens, people

00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.995
who live in the United
States who are entitled

00:37:36.995 --> 00:37:38.120
to have their voices heard.

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:40.160
And we should, as a
news organization,

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.639
make sure that we're listening
to all voices out there.

00:37:43.639 --> 00:37:45.680
AUDIENCE: I read a lot of
news and I consistently

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.640
read the "Washington Post."

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.190
It's my favorite
newspaper, so thank you.

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:49.148
MARTY BARON: It's what?

00:37:49.148 --> 00:37:51.500
AUDIENCE: It's my very favorite
newspaper, so thank you.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:55.310
I'd love to hear about
how-- what is it--

00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:58.160
how is your approach different
than other news organizations

00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.060
in the United States?

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:00.476
For example, "The
New York Times."

00:38:00.476 --> 00:38:03.950
What is it that you feel sets
your news organization apart?

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:07.040
MARTY BARON: For one, I
think that we've adapted,

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:10.310
and I should say embraced, the
web in a way that I think--

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:12.880
perhaps more quickly
and more fully

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:15.530
than other news
organizations have.

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:18.800
And that extends to--

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:23.000
we've felt that we need
to be true to our values

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.840
and our principles, but that
the current digital environment

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.210
requires us to find new
forms of expression,

00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:31.590
to tell stories
in different ways.

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:34.550
So we have now, for years,
been telling stories

00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:37.280
and incorporating all the
tools that we have today--

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.200
audio, video,
original documents,

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.720
annotations of documents,
interactive graphics--

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.590
all within the corpus
of an individual story.

00:38:45.590 --> 00:38:49.280
We also tell those stories in
a much more conversational way.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:52.010
I think a much more accessible
way, where you're not just

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:53.760
hearing an institutional
voice, but you're

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:57.740
getting the authentic
voice of the author.

00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:00.120
I think people now want
a sense of authenticity,

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.570
and I think that that kind
of writing style actually

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:04.482
is more authentic.

00:39:04.482 --> 00:39:06.440
We've paid a lot of
attention to our headlines.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:08.420
We were talking
about that earlier.

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:11.000
They're written in a much more--

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.370
they're not what I call
"newspaper headlinese," which

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:16.520
has to be squeezed
into a defined space.

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:19.820
But they are intended to
get people's attention.

00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:23.120
I was in Spain a few weeks
ago, and some of the students

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.000
there at the
University in Pamplona,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.612
they said, well, a
lot of people now

00:39:27.612 --> 00:39:28.820
will only read the headlines.

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:31.340
How do you get them
to read a whole story?

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.319
And I said, write
a good headline.

00:39:33.319 --> 00:39:34.610
And they'll click on the story.

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:37.040
But the headline has to be
true to the actual substance

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.329
of the story.

00:39:38.329 --> 00:39:39.620
So we've really worked on that.

00:39:39.620 --> 00:39:43.220
And I think that you're
now seeing "The New York

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:45.740
Times" begin to change
its style of headlines.

00:39:45.740 --> 00:39:48.770
You're beginning to see them
do stories that incorporate all

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:51.590
the tools that we have, that
look less like a newspaper

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.660
story and more like
something that's

00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:55.500
actually native to the web.

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:59.990
I think we recognize
that the web is

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:05.390
its own medium, in the same way
that newspapers were a medium.

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:07.310
Then radio came along
and you didn't just

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:09.394
read newspaper stories on radio.

00:40:09.394 --> 00:40:11.810
And then television came along
and you didn't read a radio

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:13.214
script on television.

00:40:13.214 --> 00:40:15.380
And then the web came along
and we, in the industry,

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:16.940
we just put up
newspaper stories.

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.410
And we said, ah-ha,
we're digital now.

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:20.472
It didn't work that way.

00:40:20.472 --> 00:40:22.680
And then we said, ah, we'll
let's put them up faster.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.776
Well, it helped, but
it wasn't the answer.

00:40:24.776 --> 00:40:26.150
And now we're
saying, no, there's

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:29.840
actually a distinct way of
writing and communicating,

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:33.530
that this new medium has
its own medium, as well.

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:37.710
And as has been pointed out to
me, it's not just a new medium,

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:39.380
it's new mediums.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:41.690
Because now we're having
to think about, well,

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:44.720
how do we disseminate
news and information

00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:48.980
on Google Home or Amazon
Echo or something like that?

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.010
What about podcasts,
which, at one point,

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:54.610
died out and now have
seen a huge resurgence?

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:55.610
It's a different medium.

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:56.545
It's not radio.

00:40:56.545 --> 00:40:57.170
It's different.

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:58.490
It's distinct.

00:40:58.490 --> 00:41:01.580
What about when you have
some outfit like Snapchat

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:02.204
comes along?

00:41:02.204 --> 00:41:03.620
OK, what are we
doing on Snapchat?

00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:05.870
And we just started on
Snapchat a couple of weeks ago.

00:41:08.562 --> 00:41:12.540
It's a very different way
of telling that story.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.880
And so I think we've done that.

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.950
I also think that we are just--

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:22.220
I hope that we're more
unflinching in the way

00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:24.040
that we tell the stories.

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:26.440
That after we've done
all this research,

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:29.480
that we don't hesitate to just
say, this is what we found.

00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.520
This is what we've concluded.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.527
We're not beating
around the bush.

00:41:33.527 --> 00:41:35.360
We're just going to
tell it to you straight,

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:40.600
and I think we do that
more than, perhaps, most.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.430
RICHARD GINGRAS: In
your mind, I hear

00:41:42.430 --> 00:41:47.830
a lot of comments these days
of there's too much news.

00:41:47.830 --> 00:41:49.690
I don't have time to consume it.

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.850
Article's too long.

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:53.910
I don't know whether
these are representative.

00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:57.740
But these are expressions.

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.920
And I, myself, aren't sure.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.900
I think one interesting
dynamic of the web

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.930
is this paradox of numbers,
where if everything doesn't

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:08.410
get to the hundreds of millions,
then somehow it's not working.

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:11.050
Whereas newspapers have
been very effective

00:42:11.050 --> 00:42:12.970
getting the right
information into the right

00:42:12.970 --> 00:42:16.240
heads, historically.

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:19.920
What's your take on
evolution of form?

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.090
And there are the
Snapchat explorations

00:42:22.090 --> 00:42:23.770
and you're just
getting started there.

00:42:25.795 --> 00:42:27.670
MARTY BARON: I think
that we just don't know.

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:29.461
I think that people
are getting information

00:42:29.461 --> 00:42:30.940
in all sorts of
different ways now.

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:33.370
It's a real challenge for those
of us who are in the business.

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:34.420
We're finding
that, first of all,

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:36.070
people don't want
to go look for news.

00:42:36.070 --> 00:42:37.420
They want the news to find them.

00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:39.253
They don't want to have
to go find the news.

00:42:39.253 --> 00:42:42.530
And so that's a lot of
what's happening right now.

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:47.347
It's an old fashioned
way of delivering news,

00:42:47.347 --> 00:42:49.930
but we have email newsletters,
which are incredibly effective.

00:42:49.930 --> 00:42:51.471
People sign up for
these newsletters.

00:42:51.471 --> 00:42:54.910
They end up in their inbox
and if they're done well,

00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:56.890
they're very
attractive to people.

00:42:56.890 --> 00:43:00.400
And we get a lot of
traffic out of that.

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:04.300
And we like it, frankly, because
it's direct to the reader

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:06.760
and we don't have to go through
an intermediary, not even

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:07.260
Google.

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:08.950
RICHARD GINGRAS: Not even us.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:11.650
MARTY BARON: And so that's nice.

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:14.710
But also, video is becoming
incredibly important.

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:17.440
People seem drawn to getting
information off of video, so

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.080
explanatory videos.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.580
We're doing a lot of them,
just as Ezra Klein at Fox

00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.340
is doing those sorts of things.

00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:25.810
Animations, you name it.

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:28.900
Two-minute videos that help
explain complex subjects.

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:32.740
With Snapchat, we're taking
stories that we've already done

00:43:32.740 --> 00:43:35.920
and breaking them down
into their essence

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:39.490
and then presenting
those in a Snapchatty

00:43:39.490 --> 00:43:43.090
kind of way, whatever that is.

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:49.810
And we just started, so
we'll see if it's working.

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:52.832
They liked what we
presented as our proposal.

00:43:52.832 --> 00:43:54.790
They said it was the
fastest onboarding they've

00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:57.520
done for any organization ever.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:59.850
And we'll see how it works.

00:43:59.850 --> 00:44:03.882
And so we just recognize that
people are getting information

00:44:03.882 --> 00:44:06.340
in all sorts of different ways
and we want to be everywhere

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.180
they are.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:08.890
And we will adapt.

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:10.060
They don't have to--

00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.130
we're not expecting people to--

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:14.080
well, here we are,
the "Washington Post."

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:16.180
You're just going to
have to come to us

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.370
and adapt to us, who we are.

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:20.950
And if you don't, then
we're going to scold you.

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:22.360
That's not our view.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:25.360
And say, you're not
performing your duty

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:27.552
as an American citizen
or something like that.

00:44:27.552 --> 00:44:29.510
Our view is that people
want to get information

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:32.950
in lots of different ways
and we will adapt to the ways

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:34.900
that they want to get
information, while still

00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.737
staying true to our
values and our principles.

00:44:37.737 --> 00:44:38.820
RICHARD GINGRAS: Are you--

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.280
I can remember a
call a while back,

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.590
I was telling the
folks at ProPublica.

00:44:41.590 --> 00:44:43.881
And one of the things they
did with their investigative

00:44:43.881 --> 00:44:46.120
journalism pieces, which
I thought was clever,

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:48.790
was they basically
said, all right.

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:52.960
This is a 3,500-word piece
here, or an 8,000-word piece.

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.450
They would basically
chunk it out.

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:56.180
They almost meme-ified it.

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.090
And they would do
a series of tweets,

00:44:58.090 --> 00:45:00.640
a series of social posts,
the whole point being,

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.890
can I use every one to
get some little nugget

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:04.455
into people's heads?

00:45:04.455 --> 00:45:05.830
Have you played
around with that?

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:06.790
MARTY BARON: We
haven't done that yet.

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:07.760
It's a good idea.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.310
I think we should
think about that.

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:12.350
One of the things-- we have a
large audience engagement team

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:14.380
and we do need to
think about, when

00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:18.160
we're doing major
projects, how are we

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.140
alerting people to
what's in that project

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:22.450
and finding points of entry?

00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:24.730
So yeah, I think
it's a good idea.

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:27.310
AUDIENCE: If you look at a
media outlet as an information

00:45:27.310 --> 00:45:30.910
processing system, then things
like Donald Trump timing

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:32.980
communications to
dominate the news cycle

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:35.590
starts looking like a
denial of service attack.

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:37.810
And things like
Pizzagate start looking

00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:39.580
like a man in the middle attack.

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:42.160
Have y'all thought about any
kinds of procedural changes

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:45.100
to make media outlets more
secure against these kinds

00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:47.889
of manipulations?

00:45:47.889 --> 00:45:48.555
MARTY BARON: Hm.

00:45:53.370 --> 00:45:56.910
I'm trying to information
process that one myself.

00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:58.680
RICHARD GINGRAS:
In other words, is

00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:01.120
Jeff going to buy Twitter
so he can shut it down?

00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.880
MARTY BARON: No.

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:05.050
I have no idea what
Jeff is going to do.

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:07.570
He doesn't tell me
what he's going to do.

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:10.980
But I think that's
highly unlikely.

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:12.720
Look, we do have--

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:16.020
every politician wants
to manipulate the media.

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:18.750
Not just politicians, but
companies and individuals,

00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:21.840
and everybody out there
is trying to manipulate us

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:24.180
in one fashion or another.

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.610
This President has certainly
used the early morning

00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:33.120
hours and the evening hours
and, I don't know, all hours

00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:34.410
to put out tweets.

00:46:34.410 --> 00:46:36.697
There was a-- a lot
of the suggestions

00:46:36.697 --> 00:46:38.280
at the beginning
were, you should just

00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:39.560
ignore these tweets.

00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:41.050
Pretend they didn't happen.

00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:44.920
The problem is that
it turns out that we--

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:47.220
and we didn't ignore
them, because guess what?

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.345
They were coming from the
President-elect, and then

00:46:49.345 --> 00:46:50.290
the President.

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:52.290
So we thought, maybe they
actually have meaning.

00:46:52.290 --> 00:46:56.730
And it turns out they actually
are declarations of his policy.

00:46:56.730 --> 00:47:00.540
They are reflections of
what he really thinks

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:02.520
and what's going to
appear in policy.

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:06.010
So we should be paying
attention to these tweets

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:07.890
and we should not
be ignoring them.

00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:10.660
And we obviously want
to put them in context.

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:12.960
We want to do more
reporting around them.

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.960
But I don't think that
we can ignore them.

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:22.980
Now covering these things,
these denial of service attacks,

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:26.490
as you might call them, that's
not the end of the line.

00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:29.590
There's a lot more work for
us to do, and we do that work.

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:33.830
So the investigations,
the fact-checking,

00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:36.090
exploring the impact on
ordinary people, which

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:38.940
is of surpassing
importance-- those

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:41.520
are things that we
do all the time.

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:45.180
So I don't know that we can--

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:48.810
he is the President
of the United States.

00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:51.450
He does hold the top position
in the most powerful country

00:47:51.450 --> 00:47:52.740
on Earth.

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:54.420
I don't think that we can--

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:57.000
it's going to be
pretty hard to--

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.430
and I don't think we
should be shutting down

00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:05.380
that source of information
or whatever it is.

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:07.290
And we have to
cover it and then we

00:48:07.290 --> 00:48:10.384
have to put context around it.

00:48:10.384 --> 00:48:12.550
AUDIENCE: The brand of the
"Post" and the mainstream

00:48:12.550 --> 00:48:16.540
media, in general, is these
elite, old institutions

00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:19.324
that lean left, which I
don't have a problem with.

00:48:19.324 --> 00:48:19.990
I read you guys.

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:21.040
I'm a big fan.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.950
But I'm curious if, from
a branding perspective,

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:27.790
you feel that there is a vacuum
in the conservative media

00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:32.080
for voters to turn to
outlets that they trust.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:36.976
And since there aren't as many
reputable conservative outlets,

00:48:36.976 --> 00:48:39.730
most voters turn towards Fox.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:43.630
And so I'm curious if you
think that maybe you guys could

00:48:43.630 --> 00:48:48.250
partner or somehow help
new organizations spring up

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:53.260
to provide news to these
people that isn't just

00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:57.900
from your editorial page
from a right-leaning source.

00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:58.900
MARTY BARON: Well, look.

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:01.870
I mean I don't know that we
can create some sort of spinoff

00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:03.340
for them.

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:10.150
We try to provide trustworthy,
verifiable news on our site

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:12.790
and on our pages and
on various platforms.

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:14.590
That's what we do.

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:18.132
I think that there are news
organizations that they trust,

00:49:18.132 --> 00:49:18.840
as you point out.

00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:22.030
Fox-- they trust Fox a lot.

00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:25.690
Breitbart has come up and
that's actually posing

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:28.810
a competitive challenge to Fox.

00:49:28.810 --> 00:49:31.360
And so I don't know
how much room there is.

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:35.350
And I don't think that it's our
job to try to pander in any way

00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:37.170
to any group, as I said before.

00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:40.990
I don't think that
we should do that

00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:44.560
in order to create a
business for ourselves.

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:48.280
We have a business
today, where we

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:51.490
think that we are, in a
very honorable, honest,

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:54.580
straightforward way, trying
to gather information,

00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:56.800
to verify that information,
and to present it

00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:01.000
in an unvarnished way
to the American public

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.134
and to the public of the world.

00:50:03.134 --> 00:50:04.550
And that's what
we're committed to

00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:05.966
and that's what
we're going to do.

00:50:05.966 --> 00:50:07.150
We know-- I know--

00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:08.980
that we are not going
to make everybody

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:10.630
happy all of the time.

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:13.030
That is just not possible.

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:16.430
We would be absolute mush
if we tried to do that.

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:19.810
And so we're not going
to get everybody.

00:50:19.810 --> 00:50:22.612
But we do, actually-- over
the course of a month,

00:50:22.612 --> 00:50:25.780
given that we've surpassed
100 million unique visitors

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:27.580
in the month, we're
reaching about--

00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:29.371
in any month-- we're
reaching about a third

00:50:29.371 --> 00:50:34.100
of the US adult population,
which is pretty good.

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:36.640
It's pretty good.

00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:39.190
I think it's more
than Fox, actually.

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:41.710
And it's more than
most news outlets.

00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:45.381
We come in a bit under
CNN and sometimes we

00:50:45.381 --> 00:50:47.380
pass "The New York Times,"
but most of the time,

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:49.540
they're a little
bit ahead of us.

00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:52.360
So we're up there and growing.

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:54.880
And we would hope
that by doing what

00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:57.460
we think we ought to be
doing that we would just

00:50:57.460 --> 00:50:58.270
reach more people.

00:50:58.270 --> 00:51:03.250
And we believe in
our independence.

00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:06.250
AUDIENCE: Any changes from
the Jeff Bezos acquisition

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:08.170
of the "Washington Post?"

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:10.720
MARTY BARON: Yeah.

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.690
Quite a few.

00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:13.460
Look, he came in.

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:15.070
He changed our
strategy immediately.

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:18.010
We were a paper that defined its
mission as being for and about

00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:21.100
Washington, so largely
regional, with a recognition

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:26.030
that within our region was the
capital of the United States.

00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:28.450
And he said, look,
I think it should

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:31.570
be a national strategy and
even an international strategy.

00:51:31.570 --> 00:51:34.396
He said, the internet has beaten
up this business really badly

00:51:34.396 --> 00:51:35.020
over the years.

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:37.010
It's taken away
a lot of things--

00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:39.280
our security, things like that.

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:43.120
But it also offers gifts, and
the primary gift that it offers

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:44.950
is free distribution.

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:47.410
And why would we not take
advantage of its gifts

00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:49.870
if we're going to
suffer from the things

00:51:49.870 --> 00:51:51.676
that it's taken away from us?

00:51:51.676 --> 00:51:53.050
And here we had
that opportunity.

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:54.340
We were the "Washington Post."

00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:57.360
It was a well-known brand
that hadn't actually

00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:00.910
exploited that brand on
a national scale or even

00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:02.142
an international scale.

00:52:02.142 --> 00:52:03.850
And when you think
about internationally,

00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:05.620
when people talk about
the United States,

00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:08.770
they often substitute,
as a synonym, Washington.

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:11.650
So there were great
opportunities for that.

00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:14.650
On top of that, I think Jeff--

00:52:14.650 --> 00:52:17.920
first of all, I would say
he brought two main things.

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.060
He brought, obviously,
financial capital,

00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:22.150
which we needed in order
to experiment in the way

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:25.480
that I think is necessary
in the current environment.

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:27.940
And a lot of people have
just focused on that.

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:30.340
But he also brought
intellectual capital.

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:31.810
He brought new
ideas and a new way

00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:35.380
of thinking, which we sorely
need in this business.

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:38.140
And it was not just a
knowledge of technology

00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:39.890
and the internet, which
is very important,

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:42.130
and he obviously has a
sophisticated understanding

00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:45.100
of that, but a knowledge
of consumer behavior.

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:47.140
We happen to be a
consumer-facing business

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:49.447
and he has a big
consumer business.

00:52:49.447 --> 00:52:51.280
And it's really helpful
to have somebody who

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:54.610
has that kind of experience.

00:52:54.610 --> 00:52:59.770
He also forced-- he pushed
us, I should say, to embrace--

00:52:59.770 --> 00:53:03.410
not just adapt to the internet,
to actually embrace what it is.

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:05.530
So that involved
a lot of things.

00:53:05.530 --> 00:53:07.750
These new forms of
storytelling that we're doing,

00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:10.152
greater use of aggregation
when appropriate.

00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:17.460
Create a rigor of thinking
about what kind of initiatives

00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:18.917
we undertake.

00:53:18.917 --> 00:53:20.500
I remember our first
meeting with him.

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:23.482
He was like, well, what are
the parameters for our--

00:53:23.482 --> 00:53:24.440
he asked for our ideas.

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:27.630
And he said, well, what were
the parameters you used?

00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:31.252
And our very limp answer
was, well, we just

00:53:31.252 --> 00:53:32.460
thought they were good ideas.

00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:36.530
And he basically
said, well, what will

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:37.780
appeal to a national audience?

00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:40.020
And frankly, what might
appeal to a younger audience?

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:43.150
Because if we don't have a
younger audience in the future,

00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:45.400
we're not going to have
any audience in the future.

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:47.970
And he was somebody who
thought very long term.

00:53:47.970 --> 00:53:50.830
So that was really important.

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:53.340
And so I think,
across the spectrum--

00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:57.110
and also, our investments,
the investments that were made

00:53:57.110 --> 00:53:59.560
were in, I would say,
two primary areas.

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:04.170
One was the editorial work
that we do, our news coverage.

00:54:04.170 --> 00:54:07.257
And the other-- journalistic
work that we do.

00:54:07.257 --> 00:54:09.090
And the other was
technology, that we really

00:54:09.090 --> 00:54:12.690
needed to be leaders
in technology,

00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:14.190
which I think we have become.

00:54:14.190 --> 00:54:16.890
We've been consistently rated
in the last several years

00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:22.360
as among the most innovative
media companies in the world.

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:25.860
And I think if you talk
to the people many of you

00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:28.950
have dealt with, I think it's
a pretty impressive crew.

00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:31.110
We are actually now
selling our technology

00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:33.390
to other media companies.

00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:36.510
So he's really emphasized that.

00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:39.930
A greater use of data,
like we talked about,

00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:41.610
how we might use that.

00:54:41.610 --> 00:54:42.850
It's really important.

00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:45.330
We are becoming much more
of a technology business

00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:47.650
than we ever were in the past.

00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:50.710
And if we are not
leaders in technology,

00:54:50.710 --> 00:54:55.170
I don't believe that we will
thrive, or even survive.

00:54:55.170 --> 00:55:00.310
And so he's put a lot
of emphasis on that.

00:55:00.310 --> 00:55:02.732
And I would add--
and certainly, this

00:55:02.732 --> 00:55:04.440
was true of our previous
ownership, which

00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:05.560
everybody revered.

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:07.980
The Graham family ran
the "Washington Post"

00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:13.929
brilliantly for the 80 years
in which that family owned us.

00:55:13.929 --> 00:55:15.720
But the time came where
things had changed,

00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:19.060
and we really did need new
ideas and we did need capital.

00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:28.500
And Jeff is incredibly committed
to our mission of holding

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:30.750
government accountable.

00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:35.670
And he says all the time,
democracy dies in darkness.

00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:40.350
We need to shine a light in
dark corners, things like that.

00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:41.900
He believes in that very firmly.

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:44.820
He's talked about
that very eloquently

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:48.390
and he has lived up to
that mission every day

00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:50.597
that he has owned us.

00:55:50.597 --> 00:55:52.680
RICHARD GINGRAS: And that's
a pretty fabulous end,

00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.846
though I actually am tempted
to ask the audience one

00:55:54.846 --> 00:55:56.040
question before you depart.

00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:59.980
How many of you are subscribers
to the "Washington Post" today?

00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:00.480
Excellent.

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:04.128
How many of you subscribed
in the last three months?

00:56:04.128 --> 00:56:05.100
Very good.

00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:07.500
How many of you are going to
go home and subscribe today?

00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.792
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:10.759 --> 00:56:13.050
MARTY BARON: There are some
really good deals out there

00:56:13.050 --> 00:56:15.150
for those of you--

00:56:15.150 --> 00:56:16.474
very good introductory deals.

00:56:16.474 --> 00:56:18.015
RICHARD GINGRAS:
Well, Marty, I thank

00:56:18.015 --> 00:56:21.780
you hugely for coming and
spending the time with us.

00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:23.310
I know it's been
beneficial to us.

00:56:23.310 --> 00:56:26.650
And it has been an excellent
partnership with the "Post"

00:56:26.650 --> 00:56:28.120
and I look forward to that.

00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:31.200
But most importantly, thank
you for doing what you're doing

00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:32.689
at such an extraordinary time.

00:56:32.689 --> 00:56:33.480
MARTY BARON: Great.

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:34.380
Thank you.

00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:37.730
