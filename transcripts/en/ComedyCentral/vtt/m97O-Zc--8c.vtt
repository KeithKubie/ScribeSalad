(piano tinkling)

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:07.207
- Wait.

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:09.208
(piano music)

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:10.243
Wait.

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:12.745
(piano music)

00:00:12.745 --> 00:00:14.614
- Okay, thank you.

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:15.548
- Wait.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:16.749 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Thank you.
- Wait.

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:17.550 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Professor] Thank
you, thank you.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.384
- [Piano Player] Wait.

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:19.218
- Thank you, thank you.

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:20.787
(dissonant piano music)

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:22.355
(clapping)

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:24.357
- Yeah, you did a thing.

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:27.559
- Thanks, it's just
a work in progress,

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:29.228
but I think it's pretty good.

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:30.696
- I thought it was great.

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:35.267
It was so much better than I've
ever seen Professor Rich do.

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:36.569
You just threw a cymbal at me.

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:39.572
- It's a fucking
tambourine, okay?

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:42.275
So, as we're talking
about music today,

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:43.710 align:start size:84% position:16%
who can tell me where
music comes from?

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.644
(laughing)

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:46.912
Oh, well, well, well, well.

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:49.582
If it isn't the two late guys.

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:51.584 align:start size:84% position:16%
I would've come up
with something funnier

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:53.052
if I had more time.

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:54.921 align:start size:84% position:16%
- We were at Professor
Leafminder's class.

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:56.322
That guy's amazing.

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:57.590 align:start size:81% position:19%
You know he speaks
forty different

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.891
Native American languages?

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:01.227
Yeah and he lets us go
into his sweat lodge.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:05.598 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Oh, you mean a sauna and
anybody can make up languages.

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:06.932
(speaks gibberish)

00:01:06.932 --> 00:01:09.102
That's a language.

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:11.604 align:start size:84% position:16%
Anyway, let's get
back to music, okay?

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:14.507 align:start size:88% position:13%
So, who can tell me
where music comes from?

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:17.910
- Professor Leafminder
plays 23 instruments.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.447 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Yeah and he's got this
eagle's claw in his man bag.

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:23.616
- Oh wow, I didn't know that.

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:25.919
He's the greatest guy ever.

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.921 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm gonna go over there
right now and suck his balls.

00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:30.924
Yeah, he's the greatest!

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:33.626
- Check please.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.663
- I'm Professor Rich,
expert in science.

00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:39.832
These are my devoted students.

00:01:39.832 --> 00:01:42.335 align:start size:84% position:16%
Together, with the
aid of harmless drugs,

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:46.372 align:start size:97% position:3%
we explore science's greatest
hypothetical questions.

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:49.876
(upbeat electronic music)

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:03.189
What if music dictates
evolution, underline.

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:06.125
What does that mean?

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.695 align:start size:84% position:16%
Is there music which
actually dictates

00:02:08.695 --> 00:02:10.830
how we adapt and survive?

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:14.733
For example, what if the
prevalence of baroque music

00:02:14.733 --> 00:02:16.236
made us more smart

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:21.007
or rap music brought
about more violence?

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:24.143
What do you think?

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:25.345
(sighs)

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:27.180
(mystical music)

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.848
What's this, a bird?

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:33.919
Native American Studies:
Your Kick Ass Spirit Guide

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:36.189
by Prof. Carmen Leafminder.

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:41.361
(sighs)

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:42.595
Son of a bitch.

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:46.533
(drumming)

00:02:50.603 --> 00:02:54.440 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Let us be one with
coyote and roam the earth

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.211
on our paws.

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:02.248
(chanting)

00:03:06.252 --> 00:03:07.720
(howling)

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.554
- Coyote!

00:03:08.554 --> 00:03:10.623 line:0%
(chanting)

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:11.891 line:0%
- What a dick.

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:13.960
I had to examine
the roots of music

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.895 align:start size:81% position:19%
with an expert
who knew his shit.

00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:19.798
How does the brain affect music?

00:03:19.798 --> 00:03:23.802
I mean, you know, the
music affect brain?

00:03:23.802 --> 00:03:26.539
How does music affect the brain?

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:27.807
You know what I mean.

00:03:27.807 --> 00:03:29.142 line:0%
- Uh, wow, okay.

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:33.246
Your ear, of course,
basically filters out

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:35.381 align:start size:94% position:6%
a bunch of vibrations
and produces a series of,

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.817
I guess, neuron,
you know, impulses.

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:41.787
- Right, like that song, I'm
Picking Up Good Vibrations.

00:03:41.787 --> 00:03:43.322
- Yeah.

00:03:43.322 --> 00:03:45.592
- What kind of behavioral
aspects does certain types

00:03:45.592 --> 00:03:47.093
of music have?

00:03:47.093 --> 00:03:50.430
- Well, I think at
a very primal level

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.133 line:0%
music with a steady beat,
a regular steady beat,

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:57.469 line:0%
there's a phenomenon
that, yes, like that.

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.440 align:start size:94% position:6%
There's a phenomenon
where we are, it appears,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.910 align:start size:94% position:6%
predisposed to get in
sync with a regular beat.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.914 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
You can think back to, you
know, working on the railroad,

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.114 line:0%
right, you know.

00:04:09.114 --> 00:04:10.416
- [Together] I've been
working on the railroad.

00:04:10.416 --> 00:04:11.250
- Right.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.451
- All the live long day.

00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:13.419
I've been working
on the railroad

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.620
just to pass the time away.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:15.288
Can't you hear the
whistle blowing.

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:16.489
That one.

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.289
- Right, it's a song
you sang while you were

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:18.491
working on the railroad.

00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:20.626 align:start size:88% position:13%
What you were doing
was hammering spikes in

00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:22.295
and it needed to be
done rhythmically.

00:04:22.295 --> 00:04:25.764
- So, if you're saying
that that primordial beat

00:04:25.764 --> 00:04:29.368
caused us to work and sort
of dictates our behavior,

00:04:29.368 --> 00:04:34.173 align:start position:0%
would you say that music
actually dictates our evolution?

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:35.608
- Oh, I don't know.

00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:39.378 align:start size:97% position:3%
I mean, most of the
hypotheses go the other way.

00:04:39.378 --> 00:04:42.448
Music is what you might
call auditory cheesecake.

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:45.317
We need food to survive,
but nobody needs cheesecake

00:04:45.317 --> 00:04:46.385
to survive.

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:48.988
- Perhaps music is cheese.

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:49.955
- Just cheese?

00:04:49.955 --> 00:04:52.124
- We all need a slice of cheese.

00:04:52.124 --> 00:04:54.560
I know I do before I go to bed

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.728
with a cheese.

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:02.168 line:0%
(upbeat electronic music)

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:05.337
(mystical music)

00:05:05.337 --> 00:05:08.675
- Sitting Bull turned
to the great skies

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:14.247
and said, "Give me a home
where the buffalo roam."

00:05:17.416 --> 00:05:20.586
It is the call of
the ancient Sioux

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:24.590
when we ruled the earth
and played in the grass.

00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:28.026
When we were just two.

00:05:28.026 --> 00:05:29.528
(breathes deeply)

00:05:29.528 --> 00:05:31.731
(chanting)

00:05:32.998 --> 00:05:33.900
- Bullshit.

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:37.870
- Who said that?

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:38.871
- I did.

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:40.606
(gasps)

00:05:40.606 --> 00:05:43.442
- Professor, this
isn't your class.

00:05:43.442 --> 00:05:45.044
This is a different class.

00:05:45.044 --> 00:05:46.445
I'm sorry noble one.

00:05:46.445 --> 00:05:50.582
- I'll have you know
I am 1/75th Chippewa.

00:05:50.582 --> 00:05:54.286
So, let's dance the
dance of the buffalo.

00:05:54.286 --> 00:05:56.421
Tatonka, tatonka!

00:05:56.421 --> 00:05:57.590
- [Group] Tatonka,
tatonka, tatonka.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.025 align:start size:84% position:16%
- That's from
Dances with Wolves.

00:05:59.025 --> 00:06:02.561 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Group] Tatonka,
tatonka, tatonka, tatonka,

00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:05.398
tatonka, tatonka,
tatonka, tatonka.

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:11.270
(creepy music)

00:06:13.072 --> 00:06:14.206
- He's fine.

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:15.808
Just a few scratches.

00:06:15.808 --> 00:06:17.143
- No, he's dead.

00:06:19.878 --> 00:06:22.281
- Hey, did you see
Empire last night?

00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:25.284 line:0%
(guitar rock music)

00:06:26.451 --> 00:06:28.554 line:0%
- Now, first of all, I
want to congratulate you

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:31.990 line:0%
on being inducted into the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.259 line:0%
- Thank you.

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.094
- When you look at
Deep Purple now,

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:38.764
do you feel that music
has changed considerably?

00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:41.967 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I think, technically,
it's changed from, you know,

00:06:41.967 --> 00:06:43.770
let's just, for instance, take--

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.603
- Nickleback.

00:06:44.603 --> 00:06:45.838
- Look at those chaps.

00:06:45.838 --> 00:06:47.072
How good have they done?

00:06:47.072 --> 00:06:49.007
- So, would you say
in many respects

00:06:49.007 --> 00:06:52.111
that music dictates evolution?

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:53.912 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It won't change
evolution, but I think

00:06:53.912 --> 00:06:56.615
it definitely has some purpose.

00:06:56.615 --> 00:06:58.150
Glad to be a part of that.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.021 align:start position:0%
For me, I was playing trombone,
nine and 10 years old.

00:07:02.021 --> 00:07:02.955
I came home--

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:04.490
- Short pants.

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.159 line:0%
- Short pants, black and white
TV in the corner of the room,

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:11.330 line:0%
turn the TV on and I saw four
little chaps from Liverpool.

00:07:12.464 --> 00:07:14.100 line:0%
And I got the trombone out--

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.634
- Herman's Hermits.

00:07:15.634 --> 00:07:16.835
- They're playing guitars
and I've got the trombone

00:07:16.835 --> 00:07:20.439
and I'm going, what if
I held it down here?

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:24.143
And that moment,
unknowingly for me,

00:07:24.143 --> 00:07:28.380 align:start size:88% position:13%
that was the moment
that the switch went on.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.715
- This is even more special

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:33.719
because you turned a
trombone into a guitar

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:35.154
and that's magic.

00:07:36.655 --> 00:07:38.824 line:0%
(upbeat electronic music)

00:07:38.824 --> 00:07:41.393
- I can't believe
he's really gone.

00:07:41.393 --> 00:07:44.130
- I was gonna have his baby.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:45.698
- Guys, I'm really.

00:07:46.832 --> 00:07:47.667
What?

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:52.671
Guys, I'm really
sorry about this.

00:07:52.671 --> 00:07:55.707
I guess if I were to put
it into a teaching moment,

00:07:55.707 --> 00:07:59.511 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'd say, music
dictated his evolution

00:07:59.511 --> 00:08:01.546
and he didn't survive.

00:08:01.546 --> 00:08:04.917
(electronic music)

00:08:04.917 --> 00:08:06.585
- Professor, while
you were undergoing

00:08:06.585 --> 00:08:09.321
psychiatric evaluation,
the class got together

00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:11.023
and made this music video.

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:13.526
- It sorta just
says how we feel.

00:08:13.526 --> 00:08:15.027
- That's great.

00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:16.428
Let's have a look.
