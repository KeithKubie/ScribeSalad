00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.620
Hi there, everyone.

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.770
Now I've got a video coming
up, probably next week, in

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.650
which I wanted a short clip
of a Yahtzee being rolled.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.050
A Yahtzee is when you roll five
dice and they all come up

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:13.950
with the same number.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.290
So it could be five ones,
five fours, five sixes.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.640
You get the idea.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.520
Now, I know there are lots of
ways I could cheat, and I

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.460
don't really have to film
it, but I've got the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.980
idea in my head now.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.810
So I've set everything up here,
and what I'm going to do

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.020
is I'm going to keep
rolling these dice

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.250
until I roll a Yahtzee.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.370
I've actually got my old
counting machine here, and I'm

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.390
going to use that to count
up the numbers.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.920
I've got a few cameras here, so
hopefully when the golden

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.690
moment arrives, I'll have
some footage of it.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.630
So I'll get these
cameras rolling.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.240
And let's see how many
rolls it takes me.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.840
So there's one thing that's
pretty obvious.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.080
And that's just the straight
probability.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.900
Let's quickly talk about that.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.270
I'm rolling five dice.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.610
When the first one comes out,
that can be a one, two, three,

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.900
four, five, or six.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:04.870
It doesn't really matter.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.530
I've decided any combination
is going to be fine.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.490
So the probability of that
first one's irrelevant.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.130
But the second dice
has to match.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.380
So it's a one in six.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.210
Then the next one
has to match.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.130
The next one, and
the next one.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.820
All one in six.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.600
Multiply them all together.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.750
And we've got a one
in 1,296 chance of

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.520
me rolling a Yahtzee.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.580
That's what I'm up against.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.768
Let's give it a go.

00:01:47.408 --> 00:01:50.030
Do you know what's funny?

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.850
Part of me was convinced that
I'd get it really early.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.660
That it wouldn't take as long
as it should really take.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.030
I guess that's why casinos
make so much money.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.340
[DICE ROLLING]

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.300
People always think they're
going to beat the odds.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:10.770
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.540
It's a funny thing because each
time I roll, I know I am

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.930
getting closer to the finish.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.480
Because I am getting closer
to the point where

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.765
it's going to happen.

00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:20.270
But I have the same
chance each roll.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.100
It's not like the probability
is getting better.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.230
The dice don't have memory.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.430
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.980
So that's 50 rolls.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.810
Now I have spoken to some of the
maths guys about all this

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.890
and asked them about what
my probabilities are.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.830
And I was told there's a 63%
chance that I'll do it within

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.590
that 1,296 rolls.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.270
That also means there's a 37%
chance that I'll get to 1,296

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.890
and I still won't have
rolled a Yahtzee.

[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.190
There was another number
I was given.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.070
And that is to have a 90% chance
of rolling a Yahtzee, I

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.990
would have to do 2,920 rolls.

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.110
I'm on 160.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.160
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.040
I know I'm supposed to be a
numbers man, but it just seems

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.980
counter-intuitive.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.720
This is so difficult.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:35.300
[CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.590
We will be going into
probability a lot more on

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.000
Numberphile, I think, in the
second half of the year.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.300
So don't treat this as some
authoritative video about

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.070
probability.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.060
It really is just me rolling
dice because I

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.100
want that one shot.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.410
[DICE ROLLING]

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.490
Of course in the real game of
Yahtzee you don't have to

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.780
throw an exact Yahtzee.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.830
You get three throws.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.420
And you can keep dice you want
to keep in the playing area.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.490
I think the probability of
getting a Yahtzee that way

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.140
drops to something
like about 4%.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.050
Or should I say, increases
to 4%.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:10.460
Not really sure what
I should say.

If anyone wants to email me
legitimate footage of them

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.190
throwing a Yahtzee, I will also
use that in my video and

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.900
be quietly impressed.

So I've reached that point now
where I no longer even think

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.235
I'm going to roll one.

is gone.

Five threes, it was.

so I came in--

well, I came in a lot quicker
than I probably should have.
