00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.030
In the last video I was a little
formal in defining what

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:09.010
Rn is, and what a vector is,
and what vector addition or

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.610
scalar multiplication is.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:12.760
In this video I want to kind of
go back to basics and just

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.280
give you a lot of examples.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.130
And give you a more tangible
sense for what vectors are and

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.320
how we operate with them.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.490
So let me define a couple
of vectors here.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.290
And I'm going to do, most of my
vectors I'm going to do in

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.390
this video are going
to be in R2.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.480
And that's because they're
easy to draw.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.070
Remember R2 is the set
of all 2-tuples.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:41.580
Ordered 2-tuples where each of
the numbers, so you know you

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:48.910
could have x1, my 1 looks like a
comma, x1 and x2, where each

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.990
of these are real numbers.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:58.290
So you each of them, x1 is a
member of the reals, and x2 is

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.580
a member of the reals.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.040
And just to give you a sense
of what that means, if this

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.880
right here is my coordinate
axes, and I wanted a plot all

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.710
my x1's, x2's.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.740
You know you could view this
as the first coordinate.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.500
We always imagine that
as our x-axis.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.460
And then our second coordinate
we plotted on

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.350
the vertical axis.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.380
That traditionally is our
y-axis, but we'll just call

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:20.930
that the second number
axis, whatever.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.630
You could visually represent all
of R2 by literally every

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.030
single point on this plane if
we were to continue off to

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.820
infinity in every direction.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.200
That's what R2 is.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.740
R1 would just be points
just along one of

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.760
these number lines.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.460
That would be R1.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.740
So you could immediately
see that R2 is

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.670
kind of a bigger space.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.720
But anyway, I said that I
wouldn't be too abstract, that

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.020
I would show you examples.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.840
So let's get some vectors
going in R2.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.005
So let me define my vector a.

00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:57.000
I'll make it nice and bold.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.010
My vector a is equal to,
I'll make some numbers

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.210
up, negative 1, 2.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.520
And my vector b, make it nice
and bold, let me make that, I

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.710
don't know, 3, 1.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.440
Those are my two vectors.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.950
Let's just add them up
and see what we get.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.180
Just based on my definition
of vector addition.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.460
I'll just stay in one color
for now so I don't have to

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.590
keep switching back and forth.

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.320
So a, nice deep a, plus bolded
b is equal to, I just add up

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.440
each of those terms.
Negative 1 plus 3.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.520
And then 2 plus 1.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.000
That was my definition
of vector addition.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.730
So that is going to be
equal to 2 and 3.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.310
Fair enough that just
came out of my

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.780
definition of vector addition.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.530
But how can we represent
this vector?

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.060
So we already know that if we
have coordinates, you know, if

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.230
I have the coordinate, and this
is just a convention.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.610
It's just the way
that we do it.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.840
The way we visualize things.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.880
If I wanted to plot the
point 1, 1, I go to

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.870
my coordinate axes.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.510
The first point I go along
the horizontal, what we

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.620
traditionally call our x-axis.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.450
And I go 1 in that direction.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.670
And then convention is, the
second point I go 1 in the

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.560
vertical direction.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.090
So the point 1, 1.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.880
Oh, sorry, let me
be very clear.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.950
This is 2 and 2, so one
is right here, and

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:31.960
one is right there.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.790
So the point 1, 1 would
be right there.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.750
That's just the standard
convention.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.090
Now our convention for
representing vectors are, you

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.160
might be tempted to say, oh,
maybe I just represent this

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.000
vector at the point
minus 1, 2.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.560
And on some level
you can do that.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.400
I'll show you in a second.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.330
But the convention for vectors
is that you can

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.350
start at any point.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.880
Let's say we're dealing with
two dimensional vectors.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.460
You can start at any
point in R2.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.820
So let's say that you're
starting at the

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.720
point x1, and x2.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:14.850
This could be any point in R2.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.630
To represent the vector, what
we do is we draw a line from

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.120
that point to the point x1.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.360
And let me call this, let's say
that we wanted to draw a.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.630
So x1 minus 1.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.160
So this is, I'm representing
a.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.250
So this is, I want to represent
the vector a.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.470
x1 minus 1, and then
x1 plus 2.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.020
Now if that seems confusing to
you, when I draw it, it'll be

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.530
very obvious.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.480
So let's say I just want to
start at the point, let's just

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.900
say for quirky reasons, I just
pick a random point here.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.340
I just pick a point.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.160
That one right there.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.410
That's my starting point.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.560
So minus 4, 4.

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.700
Now if I want to represent my
vector a, what I just said is

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.240
that I add the first term
in vector a to my first

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.570
coordinate.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.350
So x1 plus minus 1
or x1 minus 1.

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.150
So my new one is going to be,
so this is my x1 minus 4.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.880
So now it's going to be, let's
see, I'm starting at the point

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.980
minus 4 comma 4.

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.960
If I want to represent a, what
I do is, I draw an arrow to

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.220
minus 4 plus this first
term, minus 1.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.890
And then 4 plus the
second term.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.990
4 plus 2.

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.790
And so this is what?

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.640
This is minus 5 comma 6.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.220
So I go to minus 5 comma 6.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.670
So I go to that point right
there and I just draw a line.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.210
So my vector will
look like this.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.410
I draw a line from
there to there.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.070
And I draw an arrow
at the end point.

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.330
So that's one representation
of the vector minus 1, 2.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.510
Actually let me do it
a little bit better.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.760
Because minus 5 is actually
more, a little

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.560
closer to right here.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.240
Minus 5 comma 6 Is right
there, so I draw

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.220
my vector like that.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.660
But remember this point minus
4 comma 4 was an arbitrary

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.440
place to draw my vector.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.000
I could have started
at this point here.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.740
I could have started at the
point 4 comma 6 and done the

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.380
same thing.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:19.040
I could have gone minus 1 in
the horizontal direction,

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.190
that's my movement in the
horizontal direction.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.030
And then plus 2 in the
vertical direction.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.570
So I could have drawn, so minus
1 in the horizontal and

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.200
plus 2 in the vertical
gets me right there.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.710
So I could have just as easily
drawn my vector like that.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.890
These are both interpretations
of the same vector a.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.360
I should draw them in the
color of vector a.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.070
So vector a was this light
blue color right there.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.300
So this is vector a.

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.520
This is vector a.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.710
Sometimes there'll
be a little arrow

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.050
notation over the vector.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.850
But either of those vectors.

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.540
I could draw an infinite
number of vector a's.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:55.210
I could draw vector a here.

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.840
I could draw it like that.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:01.280
Vector a, it goes
back 1 and up 2.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.650
So vector a could
be right there.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.160
Similarly vector b.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.200
What does vector b do?

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:11.790
I could pick some arbitrary
point for vector b.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:16.930
It goes to the right 3, so it
goes to the right 1, 2, 3 and

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:17.820
then it goes up 1.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:20.970
So vector b, one representation
of vector b,

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:23.630
looks like this.

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:24.420
Another represention.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.390
I can start it right here.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:31.840
I could go to the right 3,
1, 2, 3, and then up 1.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:36.820
This would be another
representation of my vector b.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.790
There's an infinite number of
representations of them.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.160
But the convention is to often
put them in what's called the

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.530
standard position.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:47.490
And that's to start
them off at 0, 0.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.740
So your initial point, let
me write this down.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:59.280
Standard position is just to
start the vectors at 0, 0 and

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.720
then draw them.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.100
So vector a in standard
position, I'd start at 0, 0

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:10.240
like that and I would go
back 1 and then up 2.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.490
So this is vector a in standard
position right there.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.930
And then vector b in
standard position.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:15.450
Let me write that.

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:16.100
That's a.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:21.200
And then vector b in standard
position is 3, go to the 3

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.950
right and then up 1.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.220
These are the vectors in
standard position, but any of

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:31.140
these other things we drew
are just as valid.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:32.860
Now let's see if we can get
an interpretation of what

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.669
happened when we
added a plus b.

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:42.429
Well if I draw that vector in
standard position, I just

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:44.630
calculated, it's 2, 3.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.935
So I go to the right
2 and I go up 3.

00:08:47.935 --> 00:08:50.030
So if I just draw it in
standard position

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.280
it looks like this.

00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.370
This vector right there.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.270
And at first when you look at
it, this vector right here is

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:05.730
the vector a plus b in
standard position.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.300
When you draw it like that,
it's not clear what the

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.220
relationship is when
we added a and b.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.020
But to see the relationship what
you do is, you put a and

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.190
b head to tails.

00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:18.090
What that means is, you put
the tail end of b to the

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.210
front end of a.

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.780
Because remember, all
of these are valid

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.800
representations of b.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.380
All of the representations
of the vector b.

00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:28.620
They all have, they're all
parallel to each other, but

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.720
they can start from anywhere.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.990
So another equally valid
representation of vector b is

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:37.310
to start at this point right
here, kind of the end point of

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:40.010
vector a in standard position,
and then draw vector b

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:40.620
starting from there.

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:41.860
So you go 3 to the right.

00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:46.470
So you go 1, 2, 3.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:48.970
And then you go up 1.

00:09:48.970 --> 00:09:52.210
So vector b could also be
drawn just like that.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:56.210
And then you should
see something

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.760
interesting had happened.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:01.070
And remember, this vector b
representation is not in

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.650
standard position, but it's just
an equally valid way to

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.350
represent my vector.

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:06.630
Now what do you see?

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:13.320
When I add a, which is right
here, to b what do I get if I

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.220
connect the starting point of
a with the end point of b?

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.830
I get the addition.

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:23.340
I have added the two vectors.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:24.300
And I could have done
that anywhere.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.870
I could have started
with a here.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:29.000
And then I could have
done the end point.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.010
I could have started b here and
gone 3 to the right, 1, 2,

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.940
3 and then up 1.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:39.560
And I could have drawn b
right there like that.

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.600
And then if I were to add a plus
b, I go to the starting

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.380
point of a, and then
the end point of b.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:48.220
And that should also
be the visual

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:52.420
representation of a plus b.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.580
Just to make sure it confirms
with this number, what I did

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.520
here was I went 2 to
the right, 1, 2 and

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.730
then I went 3 up.

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:03.300
1, 2, 3 and I got a plus b.

00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:04.870
Now let's think about
what happens when

00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:06.740
we scale our vectors.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:12.180
When we multiply it times
some scalar factor.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.860
So let me pick new vectors.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.670
Those have gotten monotonous.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.860
Let me define vector v.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.550
v for vector.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:25.620
Let's say that it is
equal to 1, 2.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:28.980
So if I just wanted to draw
vector v in standard position,

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.130
I would just go 1 to
the horizontal and

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.180
then 2 to the vertical.

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:34.870
That's it.

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.210
That's the vector in
standard position.

00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:39.620
If I wanted to do it in a non
standard position, I could do

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:40.160
it right here.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.980
1 to the right up 2,
just like that.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.810
Equally valid way of
drawing vector v.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:48.950
Equally valid way of doing it.

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:51.740
Now what happens if I
multiply vector v.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:58.570
What if I have, I don't know,
what if I have 2 times v?

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:03.060
2 times my vector v is now going
to be equal to 2 times

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.740
each of these terms. So it's
going to be 2 times 1 which is

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:11.800
2, and then 2 times
2 which is 4.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.120
Now what does 2 times
vector v look like?

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.650
Well let me just start from
an arbitrary position.

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.390
Let me just start
right over here.

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:22.940
So I'm going to go 2
to the right, 1, 2.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:23.880
And I go up 4.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.220
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:30.530
So this is what 2 times
vector v looks like.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.970
This is 2 times my vector v.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.160
And if you look at it, it's
pointing in the exact same

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.690
direction but now it's
twice as long.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:42.180
And that makes sense because we
scaled it by a factor of 2.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.910
When you multiply it by a
scalar, or you're not changing

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:45.550
its direction.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.180
Its direction is the exact same
thing as it was before.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.250
You're just scaling
it by that amount.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.530
And I could draw
this anywhere.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:52.270
I could have drawn
it right here.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:54.580
I could have drawn 2v
right on top of v.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.780
Then you would have seen it,
I don't want to cover it.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:13:00.330
You would have seen that it
goes, it's exactly, in this

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:01.570
case when I draw it in standard

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:03.100
position, it's colinear.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.630
It's along the same line,
it's just twice as far.

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:06.750
it's just twice as long
but they have

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.700
the exact same direction.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:15.450
Now what happens if I were
to multiply minus 4

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.880
times our vector v?

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:23.060
Well then that will be equal
to minus 4 times 1,

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.440
which is minus 4.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:28.720
And then minus 4 times
2, which is minus 8.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.000
So this is on my new vector.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.270
Minus 4, minus 8.

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.020
This is minus 4 times
our vector v.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.500
So let's just start at
some arbitrary point.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.630
Let's just do it in
standard position.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.850
So you go to the right 4.

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:41.910
Or you go to the left 4.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:45.460
So so you go to the left
4, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.890
And then down 8.

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:48.520
Looks like that.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:52.140
So this new vector is going
to look like this.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.670
Let me try and draw a relatively
straight line.

00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:56.000
There you go.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.290
So this is minus 4 times
our vector v.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:00.730
I'll draw a little arrow
on it to make sure

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:01.540
you know it's a vector.

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.110
Now what happened?

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.640
Well we're kind of in
the same direction.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.480
Actually we're in the exact
opposite direction.

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.970
But we're still along the
same line, right?

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:11.940
But we're just in the exact
opposite direction.

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:16.370
And it's this negative right
there that flipped us around.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:18.850
If we just multiplied negative
1 times this, we would have

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:21.680
just flipped around to
right there, right?

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.150
But we multiplied it
by negative 4.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.150
So we scaled it by 4, so you
make it 4 times as long, and

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.830
then it's negative, so
then it flips around.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.070
It flips backwards.

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:35.500
So now that we have that notion,
we can kind of start

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:40.510
understanding the idea of
subtracting vectors.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:44.320
Let me make up 2 new
vectors right now.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:51.800
Let's say my vector x, nice and
bold x, is equal to, and

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.140
I'm doing everything in R2, but
in the last part of this

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:57.210
video I'll make a few examples
in R3 or R4.

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:04.170
Let's say my vector x
is equal to 2, 4.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:06.720
And let's say I have
a vector y.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.750
y, make it nice and bold.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:16.410
And then that is equal to
negative 1, minus 2.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:20.460
And I want to think about
the notion of what x

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.110
minus y is equal to.

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:30.970
Well we can say that this is the
same thing as x plus minus

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:34.250
1 times our vector y.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:34.980
Right?

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.230
So x plus minus 1 times
our vector y.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:38.700
Now we can use our
definitions.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.260
We know how to multiply
by a scalar.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:42.540
So we'll say that this
is equal to,

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:43.200
let me switch colors.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.760
I don't like this color.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.440
This is equal to our
x vector is 2, 4.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.480
And then what's minus
1 times y?

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.070
So minus 1 times y is minus
1 times minus 1 is 1.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:16:00.160
And then minus 1 times
minus 2 is 2.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.030
So x minus y is going to be
these two vectors added to

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.620
each other, right?

00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:05.340
I'm just adding the
minus of y.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:09.500
This is minus vector y.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:16.430
So this x minus y is going to
be equal to 3 and 3 and 6.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.500
So let's see what that looks
like when we visually

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.690
represent them.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:22.160
Our vector x was 2, 4.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.980
So 2, 4 in standard position
it looks like this.

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:31.720
That's my vector x.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.420
And then vector y in standard
position, let me do it in a

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:37.610
different color, I'll
do y in green.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:39.865
Vector y is minus 1, minus 2.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.980
It looks just like this.

00:16:56.105 --> 00:16:58.980
And actually I ended up
inadvertently doing collinear

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:01.570
vectors, but, hey, this
is interesting too.

00:17:01.570 --> 00:17:03.540
So this is vector y.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.020
So then what's their
difference?

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.020
This is 3, 6.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.720
So it's the vector 3, 6.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.030
So it's this vector.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.720
Let me draw it someplace else.

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.130
If I start here I go 1, 2, 3.

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:16.800
And then I go up 6.

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.920
So then up 6.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.440
It's a vector that
looks like this.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.050
That's the difference between
the two vectors.

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.900
So at first you say,
this is x minus y.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.550
Hey, how is this the difference
of these two?

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.170
Well if you overlay this.

00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:34.040
If you just shift this over
this, you could actually just

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.190
start here and go straight up.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.710
And you'll see that it's really
the difference between

00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:39.310
the end points.

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:41.250
You're kind of connecting
the end points.

00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:44.250
I actually didn't want to
draw collinear vectors.

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.860
Let me do another example.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.120
Although that one's kind
of interesting.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.700
You often don't see that
one in a book.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:57.450
Let me to define vector x
in this case to be 2, 3.

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:09.870
And let me define vector y
to be minus 4, minus 2.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:11.980
So what would be x in
standard position?

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:13.950
It would be 2, 3.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:15.250
It'd look like that.

00:18:15.250 --> 00:18:18.710
That is our vector x if we
start at the origin.

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:19.990
So this is x.

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:21.640
And then what does vector
y look like?

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.580
I'll do y in orange.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:26.740
Minus 4, minus 2.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.500
So vector y looks like this.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.325
Now what is x minus y?

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:44.020
Well you know, we could
view this, 2 plus

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.410
minus 1 times this.

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:47.090
We could just say
2 minus minus 4.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:48.700
I think you get the idea now.

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.320
But we just did it the first
way the last time because I

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.540
wanted to go from my basic
definitions of scalar

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.030
multiplication.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:19:01.420
So x minus y is just going to
be equal to 2 plus minus 1

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:04.390
times minus 4, or
2 minus minus 4.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:07.610
That's the same thing as
2 plus 4, so it's 6.

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:13.420
And then it's 3 minus
minus 2, so it's 5.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:13.740
Right?

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.360
So the difference between the
two is the vector 6, 5.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.870
So you could draw it
out here again.

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:23.670
So you could go, add 6 to 4, go
up there, then to 5, you'd

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:24.360
go like that.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:26.850
So the vector would look
something like this.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:31.260
It shouldn't curve like that,
so that's x minus y.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:33.850
But if we drew them between,
like in the last example, I

00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:36.540
showed that you could draw it
between their two heads.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.770
So if you do it here, what
does it look like?

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:45.510
Well if you start at this point
right there and you go 6

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:50.780
to the right and then up 5,
you end up right there.

00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:55.240
So the difference between the
two vectors, let me make sure

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.300
I get it, the difference
between the two

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.610
vectors looks like that.

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:01.440
It looks just like that.

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.173
Which kind of should make
sense intuitively.

00:20:04.173 --> 00:20:05.900
x minus y.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.710
That's the difference between
the two vectors.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.780
You can view the difference as,
how do you get from one

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:12.300
vector to another
vector, right?

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.860
Like if, you know, let's go
back to our kind of second

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.310
grade world of just scalars.

00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:21.410
If I say what 7 minus 5 is, and
you say it's equal to 2,

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:25.210
well that just tells you that
5 plus 2 is equal to 7.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:27.950
Or the difference between
5 and 7 is 2.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.410
And here you're saying, look the
difference between x and y

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:33.710
is this vector right there.

00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:35.680
It's equal to that vector
right there.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.980
Or you could say look, if I
take 5 and add 2 I get 7.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:43.850
Or you could say, look, if I
take vector y, and I add

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:47.780
vector x minus y, then
I get vector x.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.750
Now let's do something else
that's interesting.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.640
Let's do what y minus
x is equal to.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.630
y minus x.

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:56.780
What is that equal to?

00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.380
Do it in another color
right here.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:03.760
Well we'll take minus 4, minus
2 which is minus 6.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.850
And then you have minus
2, minus 3.

00:21:05.850 --> 00:21:08.190
It's minus 5.

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:11.810
So y minus x is going to be,
let's see, if we start here

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:13.430
we're going to go down 6.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:16.210
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:21:16.210 --> 00:21:17.470
And then back 5.

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:20.350
So back 2, 4, 5.

00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:23.530
So y minus x looks like this.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.860
It's really the exact
same vector.

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.480
Remember, it doesn't matter
where we start.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.590
It's just pointing in the
opposite direction.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:34.360
So if we shifted it here.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.460
I could draw it right
on top of this.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.990
It would be the exact as x
minus y, but just in the

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.290
opposite direction.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:42.500
Which is just a general
good thing to know.

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.930
So you can kind of do them as
the negatives of each other.

00:21:46.930 --> 00:21:48.760
And actually let me make
that point very clear.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.790
You know we drew y.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:57.120
Actually let me draw x, x
we could draw as 2, 3.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.280
So you go to the right
2 and then up 3.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.250
I've done this before.

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:02.980
This is x in non standard
position.

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:04.450
That's x as well.

00:22:04.450 --> 00:22:06.160
What is negative x?

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.760
Negative x is minus 2 minus 3.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.280
So if I were to start here,
I'd go to minus 2, then

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.220
I'd go minus 3.

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:17.560
So minus x would look
just like this.

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.100
Minus x.

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:19.260
It looks just like x.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:20.100
It's parallel.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.590
It has the same magnitude.

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:24.140
It's just pointing in the exact
opposite direction.

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:26.790
And this is just a good thing
to kind of really get seared

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:29.360
into your brain is to have an
intuition for these things.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:35.510
Now just to kind of finish up
this kind of idea of adding

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:37.410
and subtracting vectors.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:39.400
Everything I did so
far was in R2.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:41.270
But I want to show you that
we can generalize them.

00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:44.920
And we can even generalize them
to vector spaces that

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:50.010
aren't normally intuitive for
us to actually visualize.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:52.470
So let me define a couple
of vectors.

00:22:52.470 --> 00:23:03.210
Let me define vector a to be
equal to 0, minus 1, 2, and 3.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:13.790
Let me define vector b to be
equal to 4, minus 2, 0, 5.

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:16.350
We can do the same addition
and subtraction

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:17.210
operations with them.

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:18.600
It's just it'll be hard
to visualize.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.220
We can keep them in
just vector form.

00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:25.320
So that it's still useful to
think in four dimensions.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.470
So if I were to say 4 times a.

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:35.670
This is the vector a
minus 2 times b.

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:36.930
What is this going
to be equal to?

00:23:36.930 --> 00:23:38.290
This is a vector.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.190
What is this going
to be equal to?

00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:44.310
Well we could rewrite this as
4 times this whole column

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:47.980
vector, 0, minus 1, 2, and 3.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.390
Minus 2 times b.

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:55.106
Minus 2 times 4,
minus 2, 0, 5.

00:23:55.106 --> 00:23:57.650
And what is this going
to be equal to?

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:04.130
This term right here, 4 times
this, you're going to get, the

00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:07.040
pen tablet seems to not work
well there, so I'm going to do

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:07.900
it right here.

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:14.040
4 times this, you're going to
get 4 times 0, 0, minus 4, 8.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:14.830
4 times 2 is 8.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.140
4 times 3 is 12.

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:24.600
And then minus, I'll do it in
yellow, minus 2 times 4 is 8.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.560
2 times minus 2 is minus 4.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:30.030
2 times 0 is 0.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:33.240
2 times 5 is 10.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:37.730
This isn't a good part of my
board, so let me just. It

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:39.430
doesn't write well
right over there.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:41.910
I haven't figured out the
problem, but if I were just

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:45.410
right it over here,
what do we get?

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.270
With 0 minus 8?

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:48.460
Minus 8.

00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.240
Minus 4, minus 4.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.760
Minus negative 4.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.000
So that's minus 4 plus
4, so that's 0.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.170
8 minus 0 is 8.

00:24:58.170 --> 00:25:01.150
12 minus, what was this?

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:03.140
I can't even read it,
what it says.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:04.400
Oh, this is a 10.

00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.510
Now you can see it again.

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:07.270
Something is very bizarre.

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:09.160
2 times 5 is 10.

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:13.110
So it's 12 minus
10, so it's 2.

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:16.940
So when we take this vector
and multiply it by 4, and

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:20.020
subtract 2 times this vector,
we just get this vector.

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:23.050
And even though you can't
represent this in kind of an

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:25.740
easy kind of graph-able format,

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:26.920
this is a useful concept.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.860
And we're going to see this
later when we apply some of

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.000
these vectors to
multi-dimensional spaces.
