1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:02,400
All right.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,540
So today I'm going to give my second
and final lecture on the human stain,

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,080
my first lecture focused on identity.

4
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:15,081
And my final argument about the novel in
relation to the question of identity is

5
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:20,301
that the first half of the novel comes
down on the definition of identity

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,070
through secrecy.

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,050
That what makes you who you are anyway,

8
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:33,051
what makes Coleman the
person he is is his secrecy,

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,960
who he really was,
was his secrets.

10
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:38,610
So I did that little
reading of that phrase.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:44,240
Today I want to talk about what happens
in the second half of the novel to the

12
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:50,661
question of secrecy and how that relates
then into the question of desire and

13
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,610
narratives. So that's
where I'm going today. Um,

14
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,290
if you'll recall on page 47 I don't
think we need to turn to this. Um,

15
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,070
desire is said to be generated by the,

16
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,330
the human discrepancies,

17
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,470
the difference between Fanya with her,
uh,

18
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:18,471
illiterates vocabulary and Coleman
with the vocabularies have to ancient

19
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:21,780
languages and his language of English.

20
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,030
So discrepancy difference is
understood as the engine of desire.

21
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:33,140
So this shouldn't be surprising
when you think about what desire is.

22
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,110
Uh, many psychological
theories of desire, uh,

23
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,140
agree on one thing and that is that desire
is reaching towards a lack of desire

24
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:44,760
is generated by lack.

25
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,140
So you can think of difference as one
version of what it means to lack what you

26
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:49,974
are not.

27
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,070
You then desire what you have not you
then desire so you don't desire that thing

28
00:01:56,761 --> 00:01:58,440
which you already have.

29
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,940
So it's just a simple structure of
desire that I want you to keep in mind.

30
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,860
Now I want to note in the second half
of the novel something that you probably

31
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:09,780
noticed at the beginning of chapter four,

32
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,990
we are plunged back into
Nathan's first person voice.

33
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,470
So that I have Nathan comes back very
strongly at the very beginning of that

34
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:24,450
chapter.
We haven't seen it for a while.

35
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:29,451
We've been embedded in Fanya and less
and Delphine and Coleman inside all their

36
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:36,471
minds using that technique of free and
direct discourse where the narrative

37
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:41,400
voice just sort of seamlessly allows
you to look at the world through that

38
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:44,580
character's eyes and in
that character's mind.

39
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,020
So that technique is highlighted as a
technique in chapter four when we are

40
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:56,190
reminded. So suddenly that this
is all being written by Nathan,

41
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,910
that the illusion of these characters
is just that it's an illusion.

42
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,460
The second half of the novel then
sets up the source of the story.

43
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,120
How does Nathan know all that
he knows to give us that story,

44
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,400
sets up the problem of that source.

45
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,660
And then it finally answers it in
the person of Ernestine's. Silk.

46
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,250
Yeah.

47
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:24,250
Ernestine Coleman sister answers some
of those basic questions about Coleman's

48
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:27,950
background.
First of all,

49
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:32,870
revealing his racial secret simply by
her presence at the funeral and her

50
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:34,760
resemblance to his daughter,
Lisa.

51
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:40,510
So her body is a kind of revelation to
Nathan and then she fills in some details

52
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:46,750
that we can see recapitulate material
that has come in an imaginative form,

53
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:51,110
different imagine a two
form earlier in the novel.

54
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,940
So I would note, and I
will come back to this, uh,

55
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:59,210
this point,
Ernestine is kind of a stock character.

56
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,530
There are some characters in this novel,
uh,

57
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:07,620
Delfin to some extent less and Ernestine
who are stereotypes of one kind or

58
00:04:09,531 --> 00:04:10,364
another.

59
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,773
Okay.

60
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,120
There are various ways of thinking
about this problem in Roths fiction.

61
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,080
Uh,

62
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,610
the critical way of thinking about
it is that his fiction is uneven,

63
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:28,540
that he cannot somehow truly inhabit the
complexity of some kinds of characters.

64
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:35,140
And he has said about his own work that
he writes novels about the lives of men

65
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,650
very clearly masculine fiction.
So that should come as a prize,

66
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:44,810
as a surprise to none of you. Um, so
that's one way of understanding the,

67
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:49,040
uh, sort of cliched quality
of characters like Ernestine.

68
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:51,810
I'm going to offer a slightly different
way of understanding that, uh,

69
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,380
by the end of the lecture,
so be looking for that.

70
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,150
But for now I just want to focus on
the structure of the second half of the

71
00:04:59,151 --> 00:04:59,481
novel,

72
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:04,460
setting up the problem of knowledge and
then producing it a part of an answer to

73
00:05:04,461 --> 00:05:07,700
it. But even though you
have that partial answer,

74
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:12,820
there's still a residue of functionality
within the logic of the novel.

75
00:05:12,861 --> 00:05:15,890
Of course it's all fiction,
but within the logic of the novel,

76
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,800
we know that there's a lot
that Nathan is making up.

77
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,920
So Ernestine story doesn't get you
Stena dancing at the end of, so,

78
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,080
uh, Coleman's bed, for instance,

79
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,190
a very important scene in
Nathan's construction of Coleman.

80
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,550
Yeah.

81
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:37,320
Um, so there are scenes like that that
are purely the product of Nathan's

82
00:05:37,321 --> 00:05:38,154
imagination.

83
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:43,700
You have the final spasm of this kind
of imagining when Nathan's stands at

84
00:05:45,121 --> 00:05:50,121
Coleman's grave and asks him to speak
to him one last time and tell him the

85
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:57,210
story of telling Fanya his racial.

86
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:03,500
So you have that last scene where we
enter fully into the minds and voices of

87
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:04,370
those characters.

88
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:05,883
Okay.

89
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,790
One question that you want to ask here
is how we should understand this move.

90
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,110
Is there something perhaps duplicitous
about the way Nathan root suggests he's

91
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:24,640
related to this enterprise of imagining?

92
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:30,090
We're told on page three 37 right
before that grave side scene that it was

93
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,260
Ernestine's

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,000
speaking to him that caused
him to be seized by his story.

95
00:06:42,911 --> 00:06:45,400
This is in the middle of the page.
Um,

96
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:51,700
I was completely seized by his story
by its end and by its beginning.

97
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:55,120
And then in there I began this book.
So we get an account of it start.

98
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,280
So he seized by the story.

99
00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:02,550
It puts him in a position much like he
is at the very beginning of the told

100
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:08,041
story that you've just arrived
at the end of when Nathan,

101
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,100
when,
um,

102
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,510
Coleman shows up at his door demanding
that he write the story of the unjust

103
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,850
dismissal from Athena College.

104
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:21,540
So there are two moments when Nathan
claims to be seized by Coleman and his

105
00:07:22,091 --> 00:07:25,840
story,
it puts Nathan in a very passive position.

106
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,770
It suggests that he's not
the active party here,

107
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,510
that somehow he has been
drawn into this enterprise,

108
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,930
into this narrative,
maybe against his will.

109
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,060
I think you can see this as duplicitous.

110
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:49,710
So I want to look a little bit at how
this is duplicitous and this is where

111
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,700
desire comes back into
the braid of my argument.

112
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,250
Is that a sentence on page one 60 a four,
I want to direct your attention to,

113
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,443
okay.

114
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,880
Desire that

115
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:11,980
urge to and habit or fill
the lack of whatever it is.

116
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:17,330
How's a structural relation
to language in Roths work?

117
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,880
So desire has a structural relation to
language and I think there's no better

118
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:27,881
example of it and there's perhaps
no better example of Roths,

119
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,700
um, uh, ecstatic sentence structure.

120
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:36,380
Then this sentence on one 64
and I will read the whole of it.

121
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,700
Um, it starts the kid, you see it
about a quarter of the way down,

122
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:42,740
halfway through a line.
The kid,

123
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:48,670
this is about [inaudible] the kid whose
existence became a hallucination at

124
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:54,641
seven and a catastrophe at
14 and a disaster after that,

125
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,160
whose vocation is to be neither
a waitress nor a hooker,

126
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,080
nor a farmer nor a janitor, but forever
the stepdaughter to a lascivious,

127
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:08,910
his stepfather and the undefended ops
offspring of a self obsessed mother.

128
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,120
The kid who mistrust everyone sees the
con in everyone and yet is protected

129
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:15,600
against nothing.

130
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,310
Whose capacity to hold on
on intimidated is enormous.

131
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,050
And yet who's purchased on life is minute
misfortunes, favorite embattled child,

132
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,120
the kid to whom everything loathsome that
can happen has happened and who's luck

133
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:35,121
shows no sign of changing and yet who
excites and arouses him like nobody since

134
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:39,630
Stina not the most, but morally
speaking, the least repellent person.

135
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:44,631
He knows the one to whom he feels drawn
because of having been aimed for so long

136
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:50,210
in the opposite direction because of all
he has missed by going in the opposite

137
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:54,540
direction and because the underlying
feeling of rightness that controlled him

138
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:59,541
formerly is exactly what is propelling
him now the unlikely intimate with whom

139
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,181
he shares,

140
00:10:00,181 --> 00:10:05,181
no less spiritual than a physical union
who is anything bought a play thing upon

141
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:10,200
whom he flings his body twice a week
in order to sustain his animal nature,

142
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:15,350
who is more to him like a comrade
in arms than anyone else on earth.

143
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,060
Wow.
That's quite a grammar.

144
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,270
What you see in that sentence

145
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:29,030
is language trying to embody
desire by its very excess.

146
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,730
It's acting out formally,

147
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,760
just how far Coleman has to reach
from where he was to arrive at steam,

148
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:46,550
at a Fanya as his object
of love and desire.

149
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,910
And you see that missing

150
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:57,700
lack is thematized in the middle of this
sentence because of all he has missed

151
00:10:57,921 --> 00:11:01,220
by going in the opposite direction.
She embodies everything he isn't.

152
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:07,330
And the grammar of that
sentence relentlessly tries
to fill in to reach towards

153
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:11,870
who she is.
And that's why I think it's this.

154
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:14,660
It's a repeated noun phrase.

155
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:17,240
That's the grammar of the
sentence and repeated noun phrase.

156
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,600
So you just have piles of descriptions
of Fanya and now let me see if there's

157
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,960
any, if there is a no, there
is no verb, there is no verb.

158
00:11:29,961 --> 00:11:34,860
This is a sentence fragment people,
this is a sentence fragment.

159
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,670
You can't find a verb for the subject.

160
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,800
So it's quite a remarkable feat of grammar
and it embodies the formal quality of

161
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:50,430
language as desire.

162
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,370
But it's more than

163
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:58,930
just at the level of grammar or at
the structural level of language.

164
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:01,660
That desire and language, um, coincide.

165
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,640
It's also there in the
way sex is imagined.

166
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,810
As auntie metaphorical.
If you look on page two or threes is one.

167
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:15,090
Fanya is dancing, uh, for Coleman.

168
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:23,380
And she insists when Coleman
wants it to mean something,

169
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,230
I guess she's just about to dance for him.
When,

170
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:32,180
when he wants their sex to mean something.
Uh,

171
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,120
she says, no, it's just
what it is. He said to her,

172
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:39,320
this is more than sex and flatly,
she replied, no, it's not.

173
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:44,180
You just forgot what sex is.
This is sex all by itself.

174
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,630
Don't fuck it up by pretending
it's something else.

175
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:54,220
What Coleman's urges is to use language
to make sex into something other than it

176
00:12:55,281 --> 00:12:57,710
is to make meaning out of it.

177
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:02,980
That's a fundamentally
linguistic enterprise by
insisting that it can't be made

178
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:10,550
into something else. It puts sex not, uh,

179
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,980
so much,
uh,

180
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:17,050
outside of language as it elevates
sex to the equal of language.

181
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:25,050
So just as the grammar of the sentence
reaches out to fill that lack sex does

182
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:27,670
that too,

183
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,830
but it doesn't require the resources
of language to be successful.

184
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,050
So you don't need language.
Really.

185
00:13:38,051 --> 00:13:42,310
All you need is sex to
produce that human connection,

186
00:13:42,311 --> 00:13:44,590
that desire, uh, seeks.

187
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:47,820
So it elevates sex.

188
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:50,350
Okay.

189
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,120
Um, sex is the analog to
writing and other ways to,

190
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,750
uh, on page 37, um,

191
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:02,820
he talks about Nathan talks about
sex as the mania to repeat the act.

192
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:09,390
And he also talks about the language
tasks that go along with it.

193
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:16,180
This is on the top of 37 when he's
talking about why he withdrew from life.

194
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:21,280
Uh, I couldn't meet the cost
of its clamoring anymore,

195
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:25,510
could no longer marshaled the wit, the
strength, the patients, the illusion,

196
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:27,450
the irony,
the art or the egotism,

197
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,570
the resilience or the toughness or
the shrewdness or the falseness,

198
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:33,280
the dissembling,
the dual being,

199
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,870
the erotic professionalism to deal
with its array of misleading and

200
00:14:37,871 --> 00:14:39,850
contradictory meanings.

201
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,290
So sex always comes along
with those meanings.

202
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:50,010
And Nathan could not separate out the
two in the way that Coleman succeeds in

203
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:54,820
doing with Fanya in finding an
illiterate woman. I think it's,

204
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:59,830
it's her illiteracy in a sense
that enables the separation
of sex from language.

205
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,940
Uh, but that may need to repeat.
The act looks a lot actually like,

206
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,590
like Roth's writing.

207
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,290
Roth is an extremely repetitious
writer across his novels.

208
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:15,890
His novels often engage the
same kinds of characters,

209
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,880
sometimes the same character, lots
of Nathan Zuckerman novels, uh,

210
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:22,700
even the ones that are not
Nathan Zuckerman novels. Uh,

211
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,620
look like Nathan Zuckerman novels.

212
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:29,540
You usually have someone who looks like
Nathan. Um, the women are often, uh,

213
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,540
often look the same.
They often rant in similar ways.

214
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:37,810
So there is something about Ross writing
that is close to that mania to repeat

215
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,540
the act.
So there you get that parallelism again.

216
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:43,843
Okay.

217
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,760
So the distance between one person and
another is crossed by language and by sex

218
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,450
in two equal tracks.

219
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,700
But it's also crossed in this
novel by the imagination.

220
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,940
And this is where the entering into
a Coleman story comes into play.

221
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:12,210
Now you will have noticed
at a few jarring points that

222
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,950
suddenly you'll be in free and
direct discourse in the third person.

223
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,330
And suddenly the eye of that character
appears. And there's an example on one 65.

224
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,510
This is Fanya at the bottom of the page.

225
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,390
She's thinking about the crow.

226
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,890
Yeah,

227
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:37,750
that cruise voice, she remembers it
at all hours, day or night awake,

228
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:41,140
sleeping or insomniac had a strange voice,

229
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,030
not like the Voice of other crows,

230
00:16:43,031 --> 00:16:46,120
probably because it hadn't
been raised with other crows.

231
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,450
Right after the fire I
used to go and visit.

232
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:54,010
You see that I coming very suddenly there.
So why does it appear?

233
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:54,821
Well,

234
00:16:54,821 --> 00:16:59,821
this is a moment when Nathan as the
writer takes an unusual liberty,

235
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,700
makes an unusual claim on us as readers
by entering directly into the first

236
00:17:07,061 --> 00:17:08,350
person of this character,

237
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:13,650
violating what has been the formal habit
of the novel up until that moment where

238
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:17,200
the formal habit of that scene
and happens on a few occasions.

239
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,160
So he becomes the,
I have fanya

240
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,660
now you might say that this is just to
emphasize the imaginative work that's

241
00:17:29,741 --> 00:17:32,590
required for Nathan to tell this story,

242
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:37,480
but I want to suggest that there's a
structural relationship between Nathan and

243
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:41,680
fauna that we have to attend
to and to to excavate this.

244
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:46,980
I want to go back to that first dance
scene on page 27 with Coleman and Nathan.

245
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,640
This is when they start to talk about sex.

246
00:17:58,641 --> 00:18:01,850
And this is Nathan's reflection.

247
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,160
The moment a man starts
to tell you about sex,

248
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:10,820
he's telling you something
about the two of you.

249
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,720
I'm going to,
man starts to tell you about sex.

250
00:18:14,721 --> 00:18:17,420
He's telling you something
about the two of you.

251
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,370
It's quite a remarkable statement.

252
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:22,880
It's homoeroticism should
not be lost on you.

253
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,240
He's telling Nathan about sex with Fanya.

254
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,920
But how Nathan here is it is
that it's about him and Coleman.

255
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:35,931
Now,

256
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:40,931
I don't mean to say that it literally
becomes about the fantasy of sex between

257
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:47,420
literal sex between Coleman and Nathan.

258
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:52,790
But I will point out a couple of things.
One is that Nathan,

259
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,450
if you recall,
has been rendered impotent by his surgery.

260
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:02,560
So his only relation in
that physical way to,

261
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,190
uh,

262
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:09,110
to Coleman is not really
as a man has such,

263
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,190
I think he's imagined to
be unmanned in this scene.

264
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,853
So

265
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:22,330
then you get on page 43 and
even fuller description of this.

266
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:27,783
Yeah,

267
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:32,700
he's talking,
Coleman is talking again about Fournier.

268
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,730
And Nathan is very much
responding in the conversation.

269
00:19:38,731 --> 00:19:40,500
We were enjoying ourselves now.

270
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,570
And I realized that in my effort to
distract him from his rampaging peak by

271
00:19:45,571 --> 00:19:47,670
arguing for the primacy of his pleasure,

272
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,550
I had given a boost to his feeling for me.

273
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:53,400
And I exposed mine for him.

274
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,400
I was gushing and I knew it.

275
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:01,230
I surprised myself with my eagerness
to please felt myself seeing too much

276
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:05,070
explaining too much over involved and
overexcited and the way you are when

277
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:08,760
you're a kid and you think you've found
a soul mate in the new boy down the

278
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:12,930
street, and you feel yourself drawn
by the force of the courtship.

279
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,880
And so act as you don't normally do and
a lot more openly than you may even want

280
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:20,310
to.
But ever since he had banged on my door,

281
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:24,660
the day after IRS is death and propose
that I write spooks for him. I had,

282
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,820
without figuring or planning on it,

283
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,750
fallen into a serious
friendship with Coleman silk,

284
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:37,070
the language of courtship and of gushing
of that overeagerness suggest to crush

285
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:41,521
it,

286
00:20:41,521 --> 00:20:46,521
reinforces the homo erotic
charge of their dance.

287
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:52,170
And the way Nathan observes his
[inaudible] body as they danced together.

288
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:57,850
And it gives it that, um,
that emotional dimension.

289
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:04,180
So we're told of Coleman in
another spot in this, uh,

290
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:09,340
basic scene that he's
contaminated by desire alone.

291
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:11,681
Nathan,

292
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:16,630
if he is seized by Coleman story as
we're told at the end of the book,

293
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:22,170
is contaminated to by that
story and by desire for Coleman.

294
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:30,090
So just as that stepping over into the
first person from free indirect third

295
00:21:30,531 --> 00:21:31,420
person discourse,

296
00:21:31,421 --> 00:21:36,370
stepping over into the eye
of his character represents
crossing a certain kind

297
00:21:36,371 --> 00:21:37,204
of boundary.

298
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:42,390
So does the erotic charge that is
given to his relationship with Coleman.

299
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,680
Now there are a couple of ways of
thinking about that homoerotic structure.

300
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:57,110
One is through the work of a
critic named Eve Sedgwick. Um,

301
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,760
and if you've taken any women's and
gender studies courses are studied, um,

302
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,570
a feminist interpretations or queer
interpretations of literature,

303
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,620
she should be a familiar name. She
wrote a famous book called between men.

304
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,990
And her argument is that in a lot of,

305
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:15,130
I think her subject was Victorian
fiction in a lot of Victorian fiction,

306
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:20,490
the homo erotic or the homo social
bond between men is channeled through a

307
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:22,444
woman.

308
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:29,100
And the perfect example of that in this
novel is when Coleman and Nathan go to

309
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:32,860
the dairy farm to watch Fanya.

310
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:38,440
So it's as if by both watching
funny together through her,

311
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,690
their desire for one another is channeled.

312
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,960
So they're able to experience
desire together and it
safely, not for each other.

313
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,240
Because funny is right there
as a mediating a f, uh,

314
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,780
point of the triangle.

315
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:58,410
But I think we can say some other
things about this structure to, um,

316
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,560
and not just that it's there.
Essentially Sedgwick's um,

317
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,880
theory allows us to see how it
works to see that it's there.

318
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,740
But then we want to ask why,

319
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:12,070
and this is related to what another
feature of the texts that you might have

320
00:23:12,071 --> 00:23:16,480
noticed. And that is the repeated
reference to Thomas Mons death in Venice.

321
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,460
Did you notice that it comes back?

322
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:23,580
Todd Zeo and Aution Bach are the two
characters from Mons death in Venice.

323
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:28,090
This is a mid 20th century
German novelists. This is
a small novel will develop.

324
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:28,990
Um,

325
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,990
it's about an older man named Ashton Bach
who goes to Venice for a vacation and

326
00:23:36,011 --> 00:23:37,630
he's a scholar and a writer.

327
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:42,990
And he goes to Venice and he suddenly
finds himself transfixed by a beautiful

328
00:23:44,471 --> 00:23:46,580
young boy that he sees at the hotel.

329
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,890
And he spends the novel chasing Todd Ceo,

330
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:57,190
the boy all around the city
and trying to get close to him.

331
00:23:57,321 --> 00:24:02,030
And the mother realizes the mother of
Tazio realizes there's this sort of

332
00:24:02,031 --> 00:24:06,920
lecherous man coming after
her boy and warns him the, uh,

333
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:11,720
Todd CEO to stay away from
Austin Bach. Uh, in the end, I,

334
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:16,790
Bach is, uh, is taken
with a, I think it's,

335
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:21,410
um, a tuberculosis or some disease.
I can't remember what the diseases,

336
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,630
and he dies in Venice.

337
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:29,380
This passion for the boy is
described. And this is the, the,

338
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:34,070
the part that Roth quotes in this novel
as a late adventure of the feelings.

339
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,980
So in those quotations,

340
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:41,930
Roth is directing us to think about
the lateness of that desire as its

341
00:24:41,931 --> 00:24:43,430
characteristic quality.

342
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:49,720
It's an older man suddenly waylaid
by an unexpected surge of passion.

343
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:53,991
Now,

344
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:58,991
what I find interesting about that is
that rock could have chosen any number of

345
00:25:00,201 --> 00:25:05,150
romantic stories to characterize.
This Hummer would be one,

346
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:09,500
uh, late adventure of the feeling.
An older man, younger woman,

347
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:14,360
why does he take a homo erotic structure?

348
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,190
Why does he choose this story?

349
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:22,300
A story of same sex desire rather
than a heterosexual desire?

350
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,480
Why is this the model that he chooses?

351
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:32,890
So I would suggest it's important that
the novel is called death in Venice that

352
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,360
[inaudible] dies.

353
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,970
There is something about homo
erotic desire and this is, you know,

354
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,600
a characteristic of fiction
that features it, uh,

355
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,410
over the centuries that it seems deadly.

356
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,800
Somehow it's deadly.

357
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,510
It's imagined as being deadly.
Of course,

358
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:03,860
this is a product of its
unconventionality in older times.

359
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:05,090
Um,

360
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:10,090
the fear that a heterosexual person or
a person who conceives themselves as

361
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:16,181
heterosexual might experience if
they are taken by a homoerotic urge.

362
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,320
So there's somehow that death gets wound
into stories of homo erotic desire and

363
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,920
the human scene is no different.
Um,

364
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,710
just want to point out,
uh,

365
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,040
a couple of examples.
Um,

366
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:43,900
you can see it in the difference between
the way Nathan describes his decision

367
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,660
to dance with Coleman and the
way funnier describes hers. Um,

368
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,680
this is funny.
A on two 26.

369
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,413
Okay.

370
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,970
Uh, this is just right in
the middle of the page.

371
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:18,490
She's playing with her hair. Um, and
thinking that her hair is like seaweed,

372
00:27:18,491 --> 00:27:20,380
a great trickling sweep of seaweed,

373
00:27:20,381 --> 00:27:25,030
saturated with Brian and what's it
cost her anyway? What's the big deal?

374
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,830
Plunge in, pour forth. If this
is what he wants, abduct the man.

375
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:34,540
Ensnare him won't be the first one
that's Fanya sort of thinking why not?

376
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,800
Why not dance as he's asking me?
Why not?

377
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,580
What's the big deal?
What does it cost her?

378
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:47,790
Contrast that with on 25 and
26 the way Nathan thinks,

379
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:53,800
what the hell?
I thought we'll both be dead soon enough.

380
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,330
And so I got up and there on the Porch
Coleman's silk and I began to dance the

381
00:27:58,331 --> 00:28:01,820
Fox trot together.
And if you look on 26th,

382
00:28:01,821 --> 00:28:06,821
do you get another description where
death comes back up as a reason?

383
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:08,043
Um,

384
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,180
maybe why it didn't even cross
my mind to laugh and let him,

385
00:28:15,181 --> 00:28:18,210
if you wanted to dance
around the porch by himself,

386
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,880
just laugh and enjoy myself watching him.

387
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,650
Maybe why I gave him my hand and let him
places arm around my back and pushed me

388
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:29,970
dreamily around that old blue stone floor
was because I had been there that day

389
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,890
when her corpse was still warm,

390
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,460
that's irises corpse and
seen what he looked like.

391
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:40,700
The corpse pops up in the middle of
this reflection on why he's dancing.

392
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,250
So two times in the space of a page,

393
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:48,390
death accompanies his decision
to dance with Coleman.

394
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,980
So why then

395
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,323
is

396
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:00,780
homo erotic desire such a threat,
a threat in this way? Well,

397
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,840
one structural reason could be that homo
erotic desire threatens to collapse the

398
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:09,090
engine of desire,
which is difference.

399
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,750
The novel has set up difference
being the engine of desire.

400
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,280
So if its desire for the
same understood as gender,

401
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,130
the important sameness being gender,

402
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,773
then

403
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,910
it looks like a self canceling desire,

404
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,850
a desire that can sustain itself
somehow or that lacks that fundamental

405
00:29:32,851 --> 00:29:35,880
structure of difference that
the whole novel seeks to set up.

406
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,050
If desire is the engine of the sentence,

407
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,970
as well as the engine of the narrative,

408
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:47,500
as well as the engine of
human connection in the novel,

409
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:51,130
it's collapse is a great threat,

410
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:56,290
not just to human connection to
human life, but to write him.

411
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:02,950
So this was one way to understand the
problem and it goes back to speak to my

412
00:30:03,411 --> 00:30:06,890
point about inhabiting
or being a parasite.

413
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,260
Upon Coleman story,

414
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:16,680
Nathan inhabits the eye and finally
begins to conflate himself with Coleman

415
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:24,090
or with Coleman's lovers.
And we get various versions of this.

416
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,340
So while,
um,

417
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:30,420
while Fanya and Coleman Dance,

418
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,480
he replaces, uh, let's see,

419
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:42,420
he replaces less.
So while they're dancing in the cottage,

420
00:30:42,421 --> 00:30:45,750
do you remember the scene? I can't find
my page number on my notes right now. Um,

421
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,870
while he is,
while he,

422
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:53,500
while they are dancing in Coleman's house
privately, this is after Coleman, uh,

423
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,930
stopped seeing Nathan.

424
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,580
He's outside in his car
lurking on the road.

425
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,970
The only other person who
does that is less Farley.

426
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:10,010
So he comes to be in the position
of Fournier's other lover.

427
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:15,120
Okay. So that's one way he enters into
his characters as he starts to occupy

428
00:31:15,121 --> 00:31:20,030
structurally the same spot as they do,
but it actually gets much more, um,

429
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:24,030
complicated.
This is on three 26

430
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:29,430
in Ernestine's conversation in her scene.

431
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:37,020
She is very helpful to say,
well then,

432
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:42,540
because Coleman Nathan has said, I've
been, uh, trying to figure out Coleman,

433
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:46,800
well then she says, you are now an
honorary member of the silk family.

434
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,670
So there he is,
taken right into the silk family.

435
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:56,270
So he starts to replace Coleman after
Coleman's death at the very end,

436
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,970
as he's getting

437
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:06,330
into the car to drive down to New
Jersey for dinner with the silks,

438
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,940
he says,
um,

439
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,253
let's see.

440
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,680
Uh, let's see. Like Stina
Polson before me, uh,

441
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:21,250
he was going to sit with his east orange
family as the white guest at Sunday

442
00:32:21,251 --> 00:32:25,030
dinner.
He become Stena in that passage.

443
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:28,450
He becomes funnier when
he dances with Coleman.

444
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,770
He leeches into all the
aspects of coalmines life.

445
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:39,040
So it's not just inhabiting imaginatively,
but there are these structural ways.

446
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:42,140
He comes to double Coleman

447
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,650
and also to double his lovers.

448
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:56,780
It's by virtue of a blankness that Nathan
sees in Coleman and in Fanya that he

449
00:33:01,761 --> 00:33:02,690
can pull this off.

450
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,790
And this is very noticeable in my
favorite scene of the novel that the

451
00:33:07,791 --> 00:33:10,370
Tanglewood scene,
which I think is quite beautiful.

452
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,730
This is on two nine to 10.

453
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,510
He's running about, um, music here

454
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,250
and the feeling that all
the people in the audience,

455
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:30,410
we're going to be swept away by deaf.

456
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,660
That's sort of an overwhelming sense
of mortality in the beginning of the,

457
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,820
at the beginning, in the middle of
the page there, and he says, um,

458
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:41,990
and yet what a lovely date is today.
A gift of a day, a perfect day,

459
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:46,610
lacking nothing in a
Massachusetts vacation spot
that is itself as harmless and

460
00:33:46,611 --> 00:33:48,740
pretty as anything,
as any on earth.

461
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,700
I would suggest that it's precisely
that lacking nothing that makes it

462
00:33:52,701 --> 00:33:57,440
definitely, because if you lack
nothing, there is no desire.

463
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,760
So it's very status of the day and the
solidity of that music that brings him

464
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:05,090
into this mood.

465
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:11,680
And then Bronfman appears the pianist
and you get this wonderful description of

466
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:13,731
what he does,

467
00:34:13,731 --> 00:34:18,731
how he attacks the piano and banishes
death with his contention with the piano.

468
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:25,810
And it should remind you of all that
sad about life being an argument.

469
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:30,320
I remember I mentioned last time Coleman
saying that all Western literature

470
00:34:30,321 --> 00:34:34,430
begins with a fight, with an argument
between Achilles and Agamemnon.

471
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:39,970
Coleman's fight with the College Coleman's
fight against the racial contract

472
00:34:41,031 --> 00:34:43,190
drawn up for him at birth.

473
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,260
Nathan's contention in the world of,
of desire,

474
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,730
which he then withdraws from,

475
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,350
he implants in his own
narrative of his thoughts.

476
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:02,660
What Nathan, what Coleman will
later say. This is on two 11.

477
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:06,230
Uh, he's Coleman says, I was
telling funny that he took 10 years,

478
00:35:06,231 --> 00:35:10,660
at least out of that
piano. Nathan had said, uh,

479
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:15,170
on the previous page that they would
have to throw that thing out after

480
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,820
Bronfmans finished with it.
He plants in the narrative.

481
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:25,210
The shared thought asserting that
somehow Kohlmans mind is Nathan's mind.

482
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:34,010
That collapse is written right into
the realest assumption of the novel.

483
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:38,250
We sort of read along in those
passages thinking, oh, you know,

484
00:35:38,251 --> 00:35:41,820
let's take this at face value. Oh
yes, they're thinking the same thing.

485
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:47,250
But of course it's Nathan who plants that.
It's Nathan who's making it up.

486
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,590
We don't know how honest Nathan is.

487
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,910
So he claims to have the same thoughts.

488
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:02,630
It's the blankness.
He describes Nathan,

489
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:07,250
I mean a Fanya and Coleman as a pair of,
of blanks.

490
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:08,823
Um,

491
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:14,890
and it's precisely that blankness
that allows Nathan to inhabit Coleman.

492
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:20,740
This is in fact a quality that
he finally attributes to the,

493
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:27,620
as he says, negroes in the
photograph of Coleman's family.

494
00:36:27,621 --> 00:36:29,150
And this is on three 37.

495
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,383
Okay,

496
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,960
very bottom of three 36. They
were Pale, but they were Negros.

497
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:48,580
How could you tell they were
negros by little more than that,

498
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:51,010
they had nothing to hide.

499
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,070
This is quite an astonishing sentence.

500
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:00,720
If identity is in its ideal form secrecy,

501
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,780
if you have nothing to hide,

502
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,990
then you don't have an identity.

503
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:14,320
There are two things, two implications
that flow from that. One is,

504
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,053
uh,

505
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:21,270
that racial secrecy is really the
only kind of secrecy that matters

506
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,700
because being Negro is the
only thing that one would hide.

507
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:32,943
Yeah.

508
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:38,150
It also means that these people are
just as blank as fornia and Coleman.

509
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:48,120
So there is a somewhat pernicious
racial simplification going on here.

510
00:37:50,290 --> 00:37:54,940
It's somewhat related to the
simplification of thinking
that homeowner erotics

511
00:37:54,941 --> 00:37:56,650
is the desire for the same.

512
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:02,550
What both of these logics leave out
is that point that is insistent upon

513
00:38:02,981 --> 00:38:04,540
actually earlier in the novel,

514
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,110
which is that the other
fellow always has a life.

515
00:38:08,111 --> 00:38:13,111
You can't know that it's simply the
otherness of any individual person that

516
00:38:14,201 --> 00:38:19,201
keeps you from knowing more
than you can see on the surface.

517
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:25,690
It's the otherness, not the
racial otherness necessarily,
but just the otherness.

518
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:29,050
So in these last pages,

519
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,760
otherness gets collapsed
back into racial otherness.

520
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:39,430
And I think this is why Ernestine
emerges as a stereotyped character.

521
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:45,690
He is a folding and analysis of
identity back into racial stereotype

522
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:52,060
and analysis of identity as as blank.

523
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,880
They have no interiority.

524
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:02,220
One question that you could ask is
whether this constitutes a critique of

525
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:03,124
Nathan.

526
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:09,780
Is Nathan being brought to task for
stealing the story of Coleman Silk?

527
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:17,850
Is this making passing racial passing
into the ultimate form of identity?

528
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:23,470
That to be interesting as a character,

529
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:26,740
you've got to be passing a,

530
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:29,500
is it indicting Nathan?

531
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:35,550
Is it suggesting that Nathan
really does Desire Coleman?

532
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:39,760
These are all kinds of questions
that you can think about.

533
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:45,030
One thing I think it does
do though is highlight the

534
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,620
constructiveness of the
narrative across the board.

535
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:56,610
Coleman says about his spooks narrative
that he could not do the creative remove

536
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:04,270
that the pros do calls
the creative remove.

537
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:06,850
He says it's still the Ra thing.

538
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,000
It's a bad book because
it's still the raw thing.

539
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,220
He has no self distancing,

540
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,050
so what the critique of Nathan does,

541
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:22,650
the implicit critique of Nathan does is
distant sauce from him to some degree.

542
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:28,780
It allows us to see him
as an unreliable narrator.

543
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,470
It also,
I think models,

544
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,830
Roths own relation to Nathan Zuckerman.

545
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,800
Nathan's Zuckerman is the creative remove
is the medium of the creative remove

546
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:51,400
that Roth requires in order
to write about his own life.

547
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:58,080
Most of the Nathan Zuckerman novels
draw very heavily on Roths life.

548
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:04,450
And in fact, at one point, Roth
writes an autobiographical, uh, um,

549
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:09,440
nonfiction book called the facts
and it's all mostly about, um,

550
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,990
complaining about the,
uh,

551
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:17,040
response to Portnoy's complaint and
also [inaudible] against his ex wife.

552
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:21,130
Very happy habit that a Roth has.
Um,

553
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:26,940
at the end of the facts there is a letter
to Roth from Nathan Zuckerman where he

554
00:41:29,651 --> 00:41:34,070
says, idiot, why are
you doing autobiography?

555
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,630
This is not your style facts. It's just
not your thing. Forget it. It's terrible.

556
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:43,550
Don't publish this. Go back to what
you do best, which is making stuff up.

557
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:49,990
Roth has played with this dynamic between
autobiography and fiction throughout

558
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:54,770
his career.
And I think the threat,

559
00:41:55,610 --> 00:42:00,610
the deathly threat of the collapse that's
figured in the homo erotic element of

560
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:05,860
this novel is the threat of it.
It's sort of,

561
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:06,800
um,

562
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,800
doubles the threat of Roth
collapsing into Nathan Zuckerman.

563
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,453
Okay.

564
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,240
And in another sense,

565
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,930
it doubles the threat of
writing really only about men.

566
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:29,990
That what's weak about the novel is the
way that it inhabits the subjectivities

567
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:36,450
of women, especially Delphine
room is just a character really.

568
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:42,960
Um, and in many small ways
Fanya is a character too.

569
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:44,460
Um,

570
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:49,460
I've talked about Ernestine less
can be seen as a caricature.

571
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,253
Uh,

572
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,920
so it's not something exclusive
to his female characters,

573
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:01,330
but it does suggest, as I mentioned
a little while back in the lecture,

574
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:04,120
certain kind of limit to Roths project.

575
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:09,870
So I will finish by saying Roth is an
extremely important writer in this period

576
00:43:11,951 --> 00:43:16,840
because of the very complexity with
which he makes the texture of his novels.

577
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:20,860
Speak to the question of fictions,

578
00:43:20,861 --> 00:43:24,130
relationship to life writings,

579
00:43:24,131 --> 00:43:29,131
relation to life and the relationship
between the writer and what he or she

580
00:43:29,591 --> 00:43:32,260
writes the writer in the work.

581
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:37,750
These are questions that
vacs writers in this period.

582
00:43:37,751 --> 00:43:42,520
We've seen many writers in this
syllabus who worry about these things.

583
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:47,170
Barth, Morrison, um, so many of them,

584
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,680
Maxine Hong Kingston Roth does it in a
way that nobody else particularly does.

585
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:59,610
He's also widely admired when the New
York Times had this feature a few years

586
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:05,230
ago. I think it was 2004 on the
best novels of the last 25 years.

587
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,580
And they pulled about 125
public intellectuals, writers,

588
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:13,990
professors of literatures,
um, reviewers and asked who,

589
00:44:13,991 --> 00:44:17,440
what is the one best novel they
asked? They made it hard. He said,

590
00:44:17,441 --> 00:44:21,850
what's the one best novel of the last
25 years? Well, number one was beloved.

591
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:24,730
Number two was blood meridian.

592
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:30,630
But if you added up all
the rough novels together

593
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,030
that people chose Roth was the winner.

594
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:35,760
Yeah.

595
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,530
So he's highly regarded,

596
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,640
although there is split opinion as you
can see there about which of his novels

597
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:43,650
is really, uh, the best one.

598
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:50,400
So I will say to you that we're tracking
in what we're reading writers who are

599
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:57,541
making an enormous impact on what American
fiction looks like in the latter part

600
00:44:57,581 --> 00:44:59,560
of the 20th century.
Um,

601
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:04,540
it's very interesting to me to see the
very ambivalences that are at the heart

602
00:45:04,541 --> 00:45:09,010
of this fiction. Now I'll
stop there for, uh, for Roth.

603
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,850
Let me just say as we go
into Edward P. Jones, um,

604
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:16,660
the novel that I don't have
on the syllabus is beloved.

605
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:21,130
It's always a novel that,
um, I hope that you've read.

606
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,660
I used to teach it routinely,

607
00:45:22,661 --> 00:45:27,340
but it's fun to shake it up and put some
different things on knowing that a lot

608
00:45:27,341 --> 00:45:32,260
of you will have read it when you read
Edward P. Jones. If you have read,

609
00:45:32,261 --> 00:45:33,094
beloved,

610
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:38,430
I'd like you to think hard
about the relationship
between those two writers and,

611
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:41,740
and the two novels. If you
haven't read beloved, I urge you,

612
00:45:41,741 --> 00:45:46,240
just go to Wikipedia and just get a
plot summary or open it up even better.

613
00:45:46,241 --> 00:45:49,940
I won't ask you to read it on the side
extra. Uh, although I would love to, um,

614
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:53,590
find out a little bit about it just
so that you, you have it in your,

615
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:57,400
in your head, uh, as you begin
to read. Okay. Thank you.
