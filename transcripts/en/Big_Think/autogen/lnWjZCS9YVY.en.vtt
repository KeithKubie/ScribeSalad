00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 align:start position:0%
can do a lot more complicated things
 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
can do a lot more complicated things

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 align:start position:0%
than a point is this kind of loop of
 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.710 align:start position:0%
than a point is this kind of loop of

elementary matter or whatever it is and

elementary matter or whatever it is and

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 align:start position:0%
so it gives you a very different kind of

this trouble is that people kind of

this trouble is that people kind of

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:09.470 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:10.750 align:start position:0%
wanted to

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:10.760 align:start position:0%

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:14.510 align:start position:0%

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:16.390 align:start position:0%
motivation for them and so they promoted
them<00:21:14.600><c> by</c><00:21:14.690><c> saying</c><00:21:14.840><c> well</c><00:21:15.049><c> in</c><00:21:15.260><c> principle</c><00:21:15.440><c> you</c>
