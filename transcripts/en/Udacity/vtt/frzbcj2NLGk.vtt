00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.560
Two advantages of sampling in genome rather than

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.900
sequencing the whole thing are that the cost is

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.039
lower and the data collection is faster. Now

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.540
overall, this is because we're analyzing less information and

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.260
we're measuring less information. Unfortunately, one of the

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.150
disadvantages is that since we're not looking at the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.100
whole genome,.We may be missing large regions of variation.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.550
We're limited to the subset that we actually choose

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.080
from our collection. So deciding on the subset will be important.
