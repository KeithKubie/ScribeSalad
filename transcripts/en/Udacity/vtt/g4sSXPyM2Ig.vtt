00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.470
What do you think, David?

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.351
&gt;&gt; So
like with our example of the arches,

00:00:03.351 --> 00:00:06.611
the main thing here is that the bricks
here are touching each other.

00:00:06.611 --> 00:00:09.259
And that's the only real difference
between this and our previous example.

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:12.625
So we're going to add a new forbidden
link here that says the two bricks

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:14.250
cannot touch each other.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:14.930
&gt;&gt; Good job, David.
