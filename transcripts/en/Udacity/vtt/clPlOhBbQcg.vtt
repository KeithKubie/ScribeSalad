00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.770
So let's see now if we can design a better search tree for Bob and Carol as well

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.830
so that they also can look happy.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.250
As you'll remember, Bob was working on the clique problem,

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.460
finding a set of vertices in a graph that all were connected as much as possible,

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.680
so a set something like this. All vertices are connected to all other vertices.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.720
And Carol was looking for the opposite thing, so a number of vertices

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.680
that were not connected to each other at all in a network.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.650
So I'm going to draw this dashed line here to show that there's no connection.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.070
We're actually going just to look at independent set

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.060
because as you'll remember, clique and independent set are so closely connected

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.360
that it's actually once you have an algorithm for independent set,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.380
it's not that difficult to design a very similar algorithm for clique.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.750
You can basically use the same techniques.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.460
So in order to design a good search tree for Carol, how do we design this?

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.630
Actually, it's quite similar to vertex cover.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.150
Remember how we defined an independent set.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.450
In an independent set, no 2 vertices can be connected to each other.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:10.800
We can actually play the same game that we played for vertex cover in a search tree.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.630
So let's say you have 2 vertices, and we're going to call this one here v and this one u,

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.820
and the 2 vertices are connected by an edge,

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.830
and we're now trying to assign values of 0 and 1 to those vertices.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.530
So 1 and 0 here, 1 and 0 here, same as for vertex cover,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.580
only this time we are looking at assignments that would be valid for independent set

00:01:32.580 --> 99:59:59.000
as opposed to vertex cover.
