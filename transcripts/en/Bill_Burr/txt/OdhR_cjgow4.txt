Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr. It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcasts. And I've just checking in on you. All right? I can't even tell you what a great mood I was in seven minutes ago, seven minutes ago. Everything was fucking fine. And then what happens? What happens in my whole technology fucking worlds? It just, you know, Internet's not working. I got to go into the one room in my house where the Internet works for whatever fucking reason. Uh, you know, it's a cloudy day. Uh, you gotta upgrade your fucking something or other, you know, all I wanted to see, you know, I found out that Liverpool lost the cup final and I know what all you assholes and of folk do you find out now you know why? You know, I just found out now because I have American Internet.

Speaker 1:          00:00:55       Okay? Do you know how many pages I have to scroll through to find fucking soccer highlights? Immediates it's after the German scat films. Okay. That's where the fuck it is in this country. And by the way, I found out that most solid guy got his shoulder yank out by some content on the other team. And, and good luck trying to find a video of the actual goddamn play. I swear to God, I want to fucking find every content out there that is acting like they have the video. Do you don't, one of the websites I went to head it had the silence of the crowd. That was the video. I don't want to fucking see that. I want to see the injury. Fuck. I will sit there and look at some fat cunt crying over his fish and chips. I want to see what happened. Cause this, the picture that I saw looked like that guy grabbed it. Pulled the Kelly Olynyk.

Speaker 2:          00:01:47       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:01:48       you fucking grabbed onto the thing and fucking yanked it out.

Speaker 2:          00:01:52       MMM. [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:01:54       anyways, uh, let me look. What kind of fucking world do you live in? Okay. We are trying to get more money off of advertising by pulling some shit like that. Swear to fucking gold again. Legal. We'll have flooded edge babbled. We'll have them walking out of the stadium with his fucking arm in a sling. Hey, yeah, you got, you got, you got the Zapruder film. Ah, yeah, we got it. You know, what do they do? Huh? They show somebody fucking with the, their hand over their mouth. They don't show the actual fucking assassination.

Speaker 1:          00:02:33       Um, God, I was in such a good fucking mood since such a great mood. You know, I woke up, daughter woke me up. Who's kidding? Who Right. Made a breakfast as I always do. We had a great time. We sang the Etsy petsy spider 5,000 times. I was in a great mood. And then for whatever reason, my stupid recorder, the metronome got turned on. I did not to turn that off. So, uh, rather than relaxing and trying to figure it out, I broke my headphones. Can you believe it like this? This all all unraveled. You don't, my wife loved me seven minutes ago.

Speaker 1:          00:03:10       I'm turning 50 and I'm still behaving like this. I just broke one of my toys, like a goddamn toddler. Do you guys realize that that's you're listening to a child? Maybe that's why God had me go bald because I was acting like a baby. He wanted me to look like one big old baby, a big old bearded baby. I should be down in Coney island. Right. And they should just have me and one of the cages next to the bearded lady and just have me trying to fucking figure out something that involves any remote basic technology. You know, look at that big old angry baby. He's 50 years old, but you wouldn't know it. And just watching me break in fucking headphones and recorders. Ah God. And I'd love to tell you that turn 50th is profound thing and that I'm going to change, but I swear to God I'm not, I'm going to be, I'm going to be breaking my walkers when I'm fucking 90 and I'm gonna sit 80 and then I bumped it up to 90 cause I just said walkers, there's no fucking way, you know, speaking of which, um, I'm back to working out again yet another time attempting with the shoulder.

Speaker 1:          00:04:14       Cause I, I'm impatient and I, I moved to up too quickly in weight and I re aggravate my shoulder. I don't hurt it again. I just aggravate it. But, uh, I really do miss, I miss working out and lifting weights and all that shit. Getting a little pump going, you know. So I'm doing it with very lightweight, like put it this way, this is how light the dumbbells are. Uh, my dumbbells are, are like pink baby blue. I have one pound, it's a girls. I have uh, three pounds. It's a boy, right? Are those, no, I don't wait. No two pound, two pounds or purple.

Speaker 1:          00:04:58       I got the purple rain to pounders the, it's a girl, one pounder. And then I got the, it's a boy five pounder and then I got a six pound that the color their orange. Right. It's like I'm living, I'm working out with Fisher price weights here. Um, anyways, but I got that TRX band and that things kind of been saving me a little bit. Um, it's weird. I can't, like, I can't bring wait up to the side out and up to the side. W like much more than three pounds is Henri aggravate my shoulder. But for some reason I can do 50 pushups. Um, and I don't know why I just told you that because now every person who is even remotely a personal trainer, you know, they're going to start giving me advice. You can't bring up dogs working out or uh, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:05:54       Something else. How to shade your beaver. I don't, I don't fucking know. You always need three examples. I'm sorry, I choked. I ran out of, out of thinks they're anyways, did you, have you guys been watching the Stanley Cup final? Not Finals, the NBA finals start tonight, but the standing Stanley Cup final, the first two games in Las Vegas. And I got to tell you something I really wanted to hate on the intro that the vikings, the Vikings, the, the nights the Vegas Knights had that game of Thrones shit that they were doing. Uh, but I get it. I get it. It's Vegas. They got to put on a show. They can't have strippers out there because there's kids there. It was a kid friendly Vegas show. I thought that shit that they were doing on the ice was amazing. But uh, it was kind of funny how, I remember in the NBA when guys would dunk, Aka black guys would dunk and then they would do make that, that motion across the neck.

Speaker 1:          00:06:48       Like we just slit your throat and they will like that. Still violate that a is that a gang side? They can't deal that any by right. And then you turn on hockey. It's a, basically a bunch of white people there are out there dressed like nights than not even Miami and going across the neck, they literally have a fucking sword right across the neck. Does all those kids there? You know what I mean? Maybe because he's dressed up like a, a night or something. Maybe, you know, I have no fucking idea. But anyways, uh, the games have been outstanding. Uh, it's really hard to root against the Vegas Knights with that story, whatever that GM or that coach said at the beginning of the year than being an expansion franchise. He said to the players, all of you are here for the same reason. Whoever you were just playing with didn't think you were worthy of being protected.

Speaker 1:          00:07:39       Something like that. And that's like the beginning of all those fucking movies. Well, you know, they're going to win the championship, you know, sneak away from the Nazis like that Sylvester Stallone movie where they played soccer. Right. That's what the, how this whole thing's playing out. But uh, I've become a capitals fan just because I've been hanging with Josh, Adam Meyers all these years, so I got to root for is capitals plus they've been waiting since 1974. Who gives a shit? It's been great. Hockey. I loved, uh, the shootout in game one. Um, as far as 10 goals being scored, I was blown away by how fast, uh, Vegas was and just how relentless there for check was. But, um, and I did like that the uh, capitol stuck up for a Tj, Yoshi and knocked that one guy in the nights on his fucking ass, which he got off easy by the way, compared to what the fuck you guys had been doing at to a Tj Oci.

Speaker 1:          00:08:40       They just decided that we're going to going to fucking go after this guy. Huh? Is that what it is? Because he's getting facewash slash boarded crosscheck. Then he finally fucking snaps and takes a dump penalty. What's that guy? Well, set needs to come out and beat the fuck out of somebody. But I loved how the capitols in the second game played a really physical game and they slowed them down and um, and Jesus Christ, that fucking safe. That is the save of that might've saved like if the capital's win the Stanley Cup, he got us to say right there that, that, that fucking saved. They go, they go back to Washington. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say really obvious stuff out there. They got a big uphill climb to skate.

Speaker 1:          00:09:26       Although the Cavaliers were down o two to the Celtics and came back and won four out of five. Oh God, am I see when the red sox lost to the mets in 86 we won the first two. You realize that if you win the first two, the other team has to have to win four out of the next five and all you gotta do is go two and three and you're fucking blow it. Oh, it hurts. Um, hats off to the Vegas crowd. I got to give it up. You know, the NHL chose so many wrong cities throughout the years, you know, to try to get excitement going. You know, Carolina, Phoenix, Atlanta, I mean, you know, Miami, it just, you know, and I just was, I was of that mindset of what the fuck are they doing? You know, why don't you just put one in mobile, Alabama?

Speaker 1:          00:10:18       Nobody gives a fuck about this shit. You're going down into basketball and football, country stock, car racing and moon moon, Shannon w you know, I mean they, they would rather stand along the Appalachian trail and cheer on a hiker than go to a fucking hockey game south of the Mason Dixon line. That was my, my belief. Oh my God, am I fucking a, I'm quoting Bon Scott. That's mad damaged gym. Um, but I, I stand corrected because I got to tell you something. Fucking Nashville in Las Vegas, the level that the fans are going crazy in the stands that they'd go in more nuts than a, anybody in the original six. Granted we understand the game more so we don't have to fucking scream and yell like that, but I think the Trifecta is going to be Seattle as much as I trashed him earlier. Those are great fans in Seattle.

Speaker 1:          00:11:16       They don't need any help to be any louder than they already are. But I will always contest the volume of that football stadium cause I went to a home game there and people just chatting before the game and I was like this is really fucking loud. And people just talking normally. Um, anyways, it was like that fucking Metallica album where they made it like louder than 10. The one that looked like a coffin in a pussy on the, on the, on the, uh, the album cover you had to like halfway up and it was still blowing your eardrums out to the owner of the Seahawks produced that one better. Um, anyways, uh, I don't know. I'm just think that that's, that's gonna be this resurgent and resurgence after some missteps and some of these cities by the NHL in.

Speaker 2:          00:12:09       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:11       I don't think that it will ever quite go mainstream though. You know, I actually watch game one at this cigar bar. Oh, look who's here. The lovely Nia. What's that? Who's that from when the one of the batteries for her little, uh, toy gonna come.

Speaker 2:          00:12:30       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:12:31       Yeah, they like watch batteries. She has this little creepy little purple monkey that she absolutely loves and it just freaks me out. It's like this, it's something you'd see in a horror movie, right, with that high pitch voice. Yeah. It's fucking head spinning around. Stays on your finger. Can you, can you close the door, Nia, so she doesn't hear all my filthy, filthy talking here. Oh, bring her in. Bring her rent. Oh, it's the kid hour

Speaker 1:          00:13:03       she's coming in. Oh, the itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout of saying this thousand times today down came the rain and washed the spider out. Hi. Can you say hi? Can you say hi? There you go. Can you say, can you say Dada? Say Mama. Yes. Right. You know where your bread's buttered. Can you say Mama? There you go. Can you say baby, you go.

Ah, that's right. I wake, I wake you wake me up a change your diaper. If we give you your Baba, right. And then I always make her breakfast. She eats her breakfast and after every bite she has to go. Mm. Yeah. Um, yeah. What did you think about what the capital's didn't game to how they, uh, oh my God, that was a real showing tell you they got out there and they played that game and I was like, whoa. He say whoa. Wow. Yeah. She likes it. The bubbles, those little bubble things. She likes you blow the bubbles. She likes to run into them and break them with their face and go and go, whoa. Being bubbles, right? Like bubbles.

Speaker 1:          00:15:11       Yeah. Actually getting shy. Um, all right, so nia, can you, can you break down for the white audience? What's going on with Drake and Pusha t? I actually listened to the song, I'm like, all right. So you know, he knocked up a porn star, allegedly, allegedly, uh, this isn't going to end with a gun battle, is it? No, that is not, no, that's not who those guys are. Those days are over by the, Oh, it is. Okay. No more gangster. You, you shot me in my live or you shot me. You shot me. Oh Jeez. Like I, that guy drives me up the wall. No, push it. See had such, I can't listen to Drake that took shots at Drake, Drake shop back, Pusha t shot back and Pusha t shot back in a way that was even more devastating than Drake's. Okay. Do you ever listen to white music when that happens?

Speaker 1:          00:16:10       Uh, white music when, what happens? Uh, answer songs in a whatever, giving each other crap at whatever. Do you know what the original one was as far as I know, the original one? Uh, well maybe it was the Flinstones when they had bugged music. Bug Music. I can't stand bug music. Yeah. Yeah. He said, yeah. Yeah. You remember episode? Yeah, they will. They would trash in the Beatles and the Beatles never answered it. They were above. I'm kidding. The, uh, the first, the first one was a Neil young made a song called southern man. Okay. And Tom Petty trashing them? No, no, no, no, no, no. Sweet Home Alabama. Okay. Is An answer song. Okay. It's all in the thing. I hope Neil young will remember. Southern man don't need him around. Anyhow. Sweet home, Alabama, you know, and they, they never, they never shout at each other or anything. Why? Why are you being an asshole? Because you're like wow. Yeah. Wow. Oh Huh. You repeatedly, that's why are you being in a hole? I don't know what happened. Neil young and who's saying all right, I'm done with you. Okay. Leonard Skinner. Oh, lynching and skin of what does it, you're always [inaudible] did you hear her? She just talked to me. That's the way she talks to like waitstaff, people going out to eat with you. It's just like, oh my God.

Speaker 3:          00:17:37       Hello.

Speaker 1:          00:17:37       I'm telling you. Oh my gosh. P You, you get so upset when I say that. Lou you off. I think, uh, yeah. Jesus. What just happened but what happened?

We've got a kid and it's costing me a lot of buddy. Anyways, I still got enough. My own Lamborghini. I Dunno what, what? What do you say? What do I have no idea? What am I talking about here? Why? Why can somebody please send me the video of this most Salah guy getting a, this, this cheap shot here. That is what happened, right? Because I was thinking, how the hell do you separate your shoulder playing soccer? You're not allowed to use your hands.

Speaker 1:          00:19:04       I would think like the one thing that never happens is you don't have any fingers, hands, wrists, any of that type of stuff. Injuries in soccer, right. Although with all the diving, I'm sure you know, if you dove a little too hard, maybe you could break your wrist. Why do I trust soccer? I actually really, I'm really starting to enjoy it. I have no idea why. You know, why I started off? I was in a crabby mood. I just tease my wife about the fact that she, um, you know, is less than cordial to waitstaff. You know what's funny is when she goes into a restaurant, she becomes me, which is she has expectations of people and when they're not met, she like, you know, gets a fucking attitude. I'm not saying she starts throwing plates or anything like that, but good Lord. Um, anyways, uh, let me read some of the advertising here for this this week. This is an offer Thursday, isn't it? Hey.

And how much money is fucking costing. They're kind of the ever see like one of those talk shows where the husband's at work or something. And he finds out his wife ran up all this credit card debt, you know, then of course it's a talk show so they still side with the woman. Ah, you need to work longer to pay off all of her yoga pants.

Speaker 1:          00:30:24       It's my doctor felt. Um, right now I'm copying and pasting that wine advice, uh, wine town advice to my wife too, my wife. Um, why did I give a shit about being rude to the wait staff? You know, why? Cause she always trashes me and my behavior. I'm going to use that in the future when you start treating the people and in and out burger a little nicer. Maybe I will work on my attempt, but you know what's so weird about FTE FTE a flip out and then you calm down and then you just looking at your broken headphones on the floor.

Speaker 1:          00:31:00       It's just that sadness, you know, why did I do that? Where's the other piece of plastic that used to hold this thing in? Um, anyways, that's 31 minutes. I wouldn't say it was inspired, wasn't inspiring podcasting today. It was kind of, you know, I kind of fed off the energy of the weather, which is a little bit fat. Um, I'm going to be running my hour around La, wherever I can get up. I'll be doing 10 minutes spots, 20 minutes, boy, fuck, I can do it. Getting ready next week for Dublin in London, England. Um, some people have asked me, why aren't you playing more cities over there? Uh, it's because I'm going over there for my birthday. That's why. And I'm doing two quick shows and um, and then I'm going to just, you know, turn 50, I guess. I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, but I'm definitely going to come back and um, I dunno, maybe a next year or something like that.

Speaker 1:          00:32:08       I want to go back and do a, a toy like I did the last time. Um, except I don't know, I just, you know, I got the kid now, so I don't know how long I could go over there for. And there is just something weird leaving the country with your wife and kid, you know, maybe I could bring them along. Maybe I'll do that. Maybe that's the fucking move. Maybe I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll do it that way. Um, you know what, I'm getting off the phone and I'm talking to my agent right now. How about look at that. It just that out right in front of you guys. Uh, that's how much thought I put into my career. I just talked to myself while talking to you guys and there you go. Look at my broken headphones. I'm sorry, headphones. Now I'm going to have to throw you out because you know, they don't make that plastic piece there.

Speaker 1:          00:32:54       It's going to end up in the fucking ocean floating around. They didn't even have to be out there. I kept these things so long that they like, like the shit was flaking off, you know, that goes up and over your head and people would always be like, you got something on your head. It's like, oh, just the spongy shit from my old headphones. I'm sorry, old headphones. You know, this is like when somebody kills their wife, like fucking 50 years into the marriage, you know, the fit of rage. I feel really bad right now. Are you comparing women to inanimate objects? Uh, yes, I am. All right, that's the podcast. I have a great weekend. You [inaudible] can somebody please send me the video d if you've got a flip phone video of most solid and his fucking shoulder yanked out. I just want to see if it's his filthiest the pictures look all right. That's it.

Speaker 7:          00:33:42       Have a wonderful day. [inaudible] back is turned from [inaudible] said that it was from Gazans masters, so

Speaker 8:          00:34:27       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:34:29       mmm,

Speaker 6:          00:34:31       here's something that I, uh, I actually read a quote from one of these magazines. I guess evidently a Clint Eastwood was hyping that movie. Gran Gran Torino. I don't know if you guys have seen that movie. I'm sure you've seen the ads for it. Where he basically is, I get up late a lot and you fucking person of another race and I'm a white man and I represented my car represents back when America was good and the early seventies. Um, I guess when he was, uh, doing the interview for that movie, uh, he calls, I guess the current generation, the pussy generation. And at first it made me laugh and I'm thinking like, yeah, Clint Eastwood obviously has earned the right to call people pussies. And I'm thinking, wait a minute, [inaudible] is an actor.

Speaker 6:          00:35:25       Okay, who plays tough guys who never loses a fight really? And even if he does lose a fight in a movie, it's a fake fight. So at the risk of making second sack religious comment, first trash in the Great Mickey Mantle, uh, now I'm going to go out to Clint Eastwood. Unlike where his Clint Eastwood, I want, this is my question for you guys this week. Where's Clint Eastwood got off like where's he earned the right that he's this tough guy. Cause like he plays a tough guy. I've known understand that with like actors. Like I remember like after nine, 11, like, um, for some reason they wheeled out Tom Hanks and like that was supposed to make me feel relaxed as an American. And I remember during that time I was doing a joke on stage going and talking about Tom Hanks saying he's done so many army movies. He thinks he's a veteran.

Speaker 6:          00:36:20       You know what I mean? It's not like you did army movies, but he played an astronaut. He was in saving private Ryan. You know what I mean? And like all of a sudden, like, he becomes like a, all these guys, like I said, you know, here's, here's one for you. I've got fucking, you know, friends out here. Some were doing the touristy shit out here in La and I take them down to Mann's Chinese theater or grooming's, whatever the fuck they calling it now. And they got those, uh, they got the hand prints in the feet, prints in the, uh, footprints there in the, uh, the cement. And I found John Wayne. I swear to God, John Wayne had the smallest fucking feet I've ever seen him. I couldn't believe it. This is the Duke John Wayne. This is the guy. Everyone was one. Just thought if even breathed on you, he fucking knocky into next week.

Speaker 6:          00:37:10       This guy had like, I think he went to fucking lady gap to buy his cowboy boots. He's six fucking the smallest fucking things. He could've fit both his boots and his cowboy hat. That's how small is fucking Fida. If you ever go to La and you go to Mann's Chinese theater, it's on the right hand side. He had tiny little ass feet, you know, actors are fucking annoying, you know what I mean? Sit there. And they put on fucking leather jackets and they play these bad asses and it's just like, dude, you're fucking, you're an actor. If you had any real fights, Clint, Huh? Somebody of a fucking rear engine, the drive through at Burger King and he got out and you settled the score maybe. Yes. I don't know what, but you know, I dunno. I don't fucking let it just fucking annoyed me. And moving on from that, somebody actually sent me an email that kind of ties into this, right? I'm not saying Clin isn't a tough guy. The guy's fucking ridiculous. He's 80 years old. He's still lifting weights, you know, the way his eyes are squinted. He definitely seems like a bad ass. But you know, I want to see his fight card. I want to see his arrest record. You know, maybe he was a juvenile delinquent before he came up. I Dunno. I haven't Wikipedia'd him yet.

Speaker 8:          00:38:35       So, and

Speaker 7:          00:38:36       change with [inaudible].

Speaker 9:          00:39:15       Hey, what's going on? It's built burger and it is the Monday morning podcast for Monday, May 31st, 2010. How the hell are you happy Memorial Day. Let's start. Let's, let's start with that. Let's show a little bit of respect. Okay. What are you doing right now? Why don't you get off the fucking Treadmill, Huh?

And uh, Iraq, Afghanistan. Where else do we have troops? Germany, right. Still got people over there just in case they start acting up again. You know them. That's what you get. Germany starting a couple of world wars, you know, I'm glad you did it. I'm glad you did it. It gave us a nice rain at the top after you lost for the second time.

Speaker 9:          00:40:12       And then us in Russia. We carved it up and stared at each other for fucking 40 years going, oh yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And then we just like, all right, fuck it. Yeah. And Russia just to forget it. I think my mom's calling me, I got to go, but you know, fuck you. Anyway. All right. And then they walk away and then we're standing there like, Holy Shit. You mean this is all ours may technically it's not ours, but there's nobody stopping us. Right. It's like Bo Jackson when he comes around and all of a sudden he just sees 80 yards a fucking green. You know Kenny Easley ain't gonna catch you, even though he's got the fucking right angle. It ain't happening. That's what our corporations did. They were like, we're going to put a fucking best buy and every God damn corner, this fucking planet. And we're starting in Iraq because as far as I can tell on my map that looks about the middle. Everybody go with that, Huh? Show her hands. All right then. Oh, right. Dead. Let's fucking rally the troops. This is the best one out of all the socks. No disrespect to the air force army and Navy

Speaker 9:          00:41:30       Udo shores of Tripoli. I'm a stupid fucking ah man. Red Cans. So I don't know where triple Lee is. What the fuck is Tripoli? That's it. A fucking awesome name. They really picked the right fucking city town or country when they said triple. I know it's not a country. Go Fuck Yourself. A European snobs. Listen to this shit who think you're better, right? Cause you had, you know more about geography and your jeans are tighter. You think you're impressing me? You're not all right. A bunch of fuck ups. Really. Amy Winehouse, that fucking Pete Doherty Douche bag who's never done anything. His big claim to fame is he looks like paste stumbling down the fucking street and you guys can't get enough of them and you have the fucking balls to look at us like we're a bunch of fat fucks. All right. Stand Down Europe. This is our day.

Speaker 9:          00:42:32       Ah Shit. So anyways, I was actually supposed to go over to Japan, right? Little fuck he sucky. No, I wouldn't do that. I would not do that. Um, I was going to go over there to go entertain the troops and I don't know what the fuck's going on with that Gig. It's supposed to be a nice three base. Bing, Bang, boom. Brian. I was gonna come land in, in a chopper. I was going to do it up just like an apocalypse now have a couple of chicks coming out. These boots are made for walking right tassels on their titties. America throw some place stations out into the crowd, play a drum solo with some fucking chop sticks, you know, little America. That's what I was going to do. And I don't know what happened. All of a sudden now it's like I'm playing a rec room on a fucking Navy reserve base in Rhode Island.

Speaker 9:          00:43:17       I don't know what happened to the tour, but I was supposed to be going over there and I was going to go over there and I was going to give it my all and I was going to hang for next to, you know, four or five days eating Sushi, hanging out in Tokyo. You know, just looking at a city like what if all of New York looked like times square. I want to see it go to what? Go to a Japanese garden. You not, you probably don't call it a Japanese garden. When you go over to Japan, you know, kind of like when you go to Philadelphia, you don't go, can I get a Philly cheese steak? It's like, dude, you're in Philly. Just say, can I get a cheese steak? All right, everything is officially here. See that yogurt? That's Philly yogurt. How come it says, Yo play? I don't give a fuck what it says. All right, you're in Philly. So all this food is ours. Um, yeah. So I guess you say, I want, I want to go see a garden. So I go see a garden and then be like Eisai Dai, Dai, Dai. I don't speak English. And then I'd be an asshole American. Like he don't speak English. Learn the fucking language. You know?

Speaker 9:          00:44:21       How fucking, how bad would that be if you just walk down the streets of Tokyo? Just sort of yelling out to nobody in general and just sort of over everybody's English. All right. I think I've been ignorant enough on this podcast. I right now you're probably wondering, you're probably wondering going bill last week according to the MM podcast.com the one and only official fan page of the Monday morning podcasts. For those of you who like to follow along at home with every reference that I make when I bring up youtube videos, you want to at your fingertips when I mentioned old actors, when I Talk About Yo play yogurt and you want to look at the carton. Oh yeah, that is what it looks like. It's all up on the mmp.mm. podcast.com. All right, actually made a little video there. Uh, let's see. Like Archie bunker.

It's not even up on youtube or maybe it is. I don't know. I don't handle that shit. I just see the red light and I just start talking to people cause I'm a professional just like all those band members on fucking Lawrence Welk. Okay. The light comes on. I start doing whatever it is that I do to pay the fucking rent. I didn't know what I'm talking about, but anyways, I told you guys that I was going to be interviewing the, uh, the wonderfully talented Nicholas Swartzman. Is it Schwartzen or Swardson or Swartzman? I think it's Swartzman with the Real Nicholas Swartz. And please stand up. Um, Minnesota's own nick Swardson grandma's boy. Don't mess with the Zohan Blades of glory.

Speaker 9:          00:46:12       All those fucking, all those movies that fucking every college kid and immature 41 year old, soon to be 42 year old like myself. Absolutely fucking loves. I love those movies. Okay. First of all, I didn't even know, I didn't even, somehow grandma's boy went under my radar. I Dunno what I was doing, but I miss when that movie came out and I started watching some clips on it. It's fucking, it's funny as hell. And I'm going to rent it this week. So anyways, I was supposed to, um, and that's what I was doing. I was ready for an inside the actor's studio. You know, I was, I was looking at his body of work and all that Shit, getting ready, you know, I wanted to have a good interview. And then, uh, you know, when you have everything all planned out and then just, you know, this is what happened.

Speaker 9:          00:46:55       Okay. I called Nicholas and uh, and I said, you know, are we good for today? He goes, yeah, no problem. Uh, gimme and whatever. We were supposed to meet in like an hour or something. So I'm sitting there and my fucking, you know, my boxers play in my guitar, right? Doing what I do. I'm trying to learn these fucking surfing, all that Surf Guitar, you know, for those of you trying to learn guitar, you know, try to learn to play by ear, so then you're not like, you know, borderline retarded in an instrumental kind of way, instrumental in an instrument kind of way.

Speaker 9:          00:47:31       salt, one fucking string. You can figure it out. You know, you'll learn some courts. I'm fucking doing that shit and I'm a girl goes up.

Speaker 11:         00:47:38       Okay. How I get to take the dog out.

Speaker 9:          00:47:42       So she walks down the street and just like in life when tragedy strikes, you have no idea it's coming. All right. Yeah. I'm sitting there trying to learn how to play. Waiting on a friend went, Eh, Eh, eh, boo Doo Doo Doo, Doo doot boop beauty you, you know, and knowing my neighbors, having the window open, not giving a fuck, right. Trying to slowly kill the old man who lives down below me on a holiday weekend. I might add fucking three minutes goes by. My girl is taking the dog around the block. What could happen, right? All of a sudden she comes in

Speaker 11:         00:48:21       opposite dawn. She looks, look at me and she's like, I just got bit by a dog food, cheese

Speaker 9:          00:48:26       freaking out. And I was like, I couldn't even fucking, I couldn't, I couldn't process it. I was like, you just walked outside to go take the dog for walking out. You're bleeding on your leg. What? What's, what's going on? She had a little, was a nip. Fortunately she didn't need stitches, but now my whole day is in shambles. It's like, what the f what did you get bit by? Was it a coyote? Was Was it? What was, it was a dog. It was a dog. Okay. Who's dog was it? I don't know. They weren't around. It was some lady there. She helped me out all his shit. The next thing you know, I go from sitting in my underwear trying to learn some bill Haley and the comets. Next seen on walking up the street. I fucking don't even have socks on him walking up on my stupid old sneakers with my feet squishing in my old new balance. Right. Why am, why are you staring at me? Nia and I talking about, I'm telling you the story as to why Nick Schwartzen isn't on this podcast. Come over here. Huh? What did I do? What? Come here. What did I say? What? Why did you go? Oh, I got bit by a dog. Like I'm some sort of jerk or Dork or something. No, I wasn't. I was trying to act like you crying.

Speaker 11:         00:49:30       Hey, let's go. Whoo dog.

Speaker 9:          00:49:33       That's, I'm making fun of me. I'm not making fun of you fucking told Nick a goddamn movie star. I couldn't do the podcast. I have to take my girl to get her to get up a little booster shot. Well, I mean, what the fuck is wrong? You don't realize I'm recording right now. I'm sorry. Yes, yes. Easy. Why don't you go over on your laptop and go on Youtube? He's clearly in more movies than I've ever been in, so I should probably shut up. Right? This is ladies and gentlemen. If you ever wanted to look up back pedaling and the dictionary. Oh, that's my tetanus arm. Oh, sorry. Sorry, I'm just explaining this. All right. I thought you were mocking me. I wasn't. I was mocking the situation where you just sit there and like nothing's going on and you know, you walked out to to fucking take the dog out. What could happen? Remember I was sitting in my underwears oh, he's on my leg. Ripped out. Well, yeah, not that chomped on chomped on what you did was you broke up a rape in progress. Yes, that's right.

Speaker 5:          00:50:32       That's right. This dog was trying to, you know, take advantage of my dog's necessarily rape. She tried to rape her and she wasn't having it. And you know, dogs can't hold pepper spray because they don't have index fingers. Thumbs. That's right. And so they bare teeth and they go at it and a fight ensued. I was proud of her. She's not one of those dogs that just lets other dogs come up and have their way. She's a fucking slut. She's not a slut. She's a dominant female and she's not taking it. Right. Well that's what I was, that was the story I was telling. Okay, well will you draw a parallel to what happened to me earlier in the day at the farmer's market when you get to, I know it's not about me.

Speaker 9:          00:51:11       Oh, and the creepy homeless guy hit on you. Yeah. You hadn't yet an awful day.

Speaker 5:          00:51:14       I told him, you know, I, you know, this guy came up to me, I was at the front, I'm sorry, I'm gee, you're really just taking this over. And he came up to, it was like, Yo, yeah I was, I was, I was buying bread from the farmer's market and this guy comes up to me and he's right in my ear, like all breathing on my neck really close. And he's like, Yo, can I get some bread or a water or something like, like it was, it was so awful.

Speaker 9:          00:51:40       What is that? Some new street slang for pussy. Yo, let me get someone at bread, sugar, 1972 slang solid.

Speaker 5:          00:51:50       It was terrible. And so I'm like, what? And he kind of mumbled something and I'm like, alright, you need to step off and whatever. Then he's trades getting close to me again. And I said, if you don't get out of my face, I'm going to punch you in the fucking face. I was so pissed.

Speaker 9:          00:52:03       You say face twice, cause that really kills your momentum. If you don't get out of my face, I'm going to punch you in your face because you're in my face with your face. And I'm not having that with your face.

Speaker 5:          00:52:15       No, I think I said, if you don't get away from me, I'm gonna Punch you in your fucking face. That's what I said. If you don't get away from me, I'm gonna Punch you in your fucking face. And he was a Ho Ho you're not that pretty. You are not that pretty in any way.

Speaker 9:          00:52:29       Hang on, hang on one second. You just sounded like you don't get out away from me. I'm gonna Punch you in the fucking face. Do you remember the cop and reservoir dogs? One of the most underrated performances ever in the bathroom with Tim Roth is in there. I said, buddy, I am going to shoot you in the fights. You don't put your fucking hands in that dashboard, that classic cop speak buddy. That's what you just sounded like. All right, so, so you almost got raped. The dog almost got raped. Go Nice.

Speaker 5:          00:53:02       Both bared our teeth and fought off. You know these fucking advances. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 9:          00:53:08       All right. I'll write, go write the script. It's going to be a nice lifetime movie. Okay. You taking over the podcast, they want to hear about me. Yeah, that's what happened to Johnny Carson. All of a sudden you let a couple people, guest host, next thing you know, you're playing golf. Wondering what happened. Yeah. Beat it. All right. So anyway, so that was the story. Somebody tried to, uh, adult let some person left the gate open, uh, up to street. And, uh, this dog came out with another dog. One was the lookout and the other one fucking, you know, came running up, you know, probably there's a little pink dog. He, Dick and, you know, tried to mount my dog. You know, I gotta tell you, I got to respect the dog up the street for its belief in itself that it could rape a pit bull.

Speaker 9:          00:54:01       You know, you know, when they make those movies about the fucking, you know, the, uh, the, the white guy from the suburbs who wrongly convicted, you know, and he, and he goes, uh, he goes to prison. You know, I just realized in those movies, when it's the black guy who wrongly goes to prison, who's wrongly convicted and goes to prison, there's never any issues about him getting raped. You know it, he's a black guy. He'll fucking, you know, kick the shit out of everybody in there, you know, and then dunk on the fucking warden when they have the annual fucking warden prison fucking whatever game. Right? But the white guy goes to jail. It's always worried about getting raped. So anyways, if, because they've made that movie so many goddamn times and you couldn't make it any better than Shawshank redemption. But Tom Selleck made that movie.

Speaker 9:          00:54:47       Somebody else made them. I came up with who the fuck else made it and Tom Selleck went to jail and he fucking, you know, he ended up running shit and he respected his intelligence and all in all this fucking stupid white guys shit that they do. Right? So I'm saying if you want to write that movie, okay, if you want to bring that genre back, if you're sick of seeing to a boyfriend and a girlfriend who are actually secretly hit men are spies. Okay? If you're not tired of that genre yet. When the fuck did that start, by the way, was it Mr and Mrs. Smith and they've made like 52 of them. Ashton Kutcher has one coming out with some other broad and they're standing back to back with guns in the, in the titles written in like pink lipstick. Okay, I'm digressing here. But anyways, this is how you, this is how you take that one to the next level.

Speaker 9:          00:55:34       This is a tip for all you Hollywood screenwriters out there. This is how you fucking do it. You, uh, you have the white guy not only be able to handle himself in the prison, but he rapes the toughest guy in the prison. Basically the pit bull version of, of, of a fucking human being, whatever, the big, the big fucking just jacked, you know. Do you ever see a dude just so big? It's like you look at the, you know, had an aluminum baseball bat anywhere on his body that I hit. He wouldn't even feel it, you know, even as head. It would be like three times he'd be like banging them on the head as he slowly turned around doing that. That cheesy Bruce Bruce Willis. Look, you know Bruce Willis has one. Look when something's going to happen, he makes his eyes a little wide. He makes his eyebrows tents.

Speaker 9:          00:56:27       One of them goes up a little high and then he, he makes his mouth like a little round. Oh. And he turns around. That's what he does. That's what he did all through pulp fiction. He did it and die hard. And uh, why am I shitting on Bruce Willis? I like his movies. What am I trying to tell? I'm trying to explain why a Nick Swardson's not on the podcast right now. So yeah, I was playing guitar. Try and learn some fucking, you know, whatever the fire, you know, the names of the bands. I'm so new to the shit. Next thing I'm going up the fucking street and uh, with Nia who still bleeding. Okay. I did try to, you know, clean it up a little bit, but we also have to figure out, you know, if she's slowly getting rabies. So long story short, we get in the vicinity now we have to start knocking on fucking doors to try to figure out, uh, whose dog it was and I'm opening the gates and the gates of creaking, easy to walk into these people's house we live on, like one of those streets are everybody's house looks like the monsters, you know, so we, you know, to a much lesser degree rather than the gates being like, you know, 10 feet high, they're like sort of waist, chest height depending on your height, you know.

Speaker 9:          00:57:34       So I'm walking in there worrying that this rapist dog is going to attack me, so I have this fucking stick that has a ball on the end of it. I look like a fucking wizard that doesn't know how to walk with the cane. You know, I got it upside down. I basically look like some blue collar guy who was wronged and he's about to take the law in his own hands, but I'm not going to get fucking bit right. I got a weapon Memorial Day, weekend, hand to hand combat. I grabbed the shovel out of my pack, so I'm walking up, I ring the doorbell and I hear Wu on the other side. I'm like fucking great. Right. And then this, you know, and then I'm waiting for the sound of the feet. Boom, boom, boom. Come walking up on the hardwood floors. This lady upstairs door.

Speaker 9:          00:58:17       Hi, I'm Mike. Yeah, your uh, your girl. Your dog just attacked my, my girlfriend and then she does just, you know, ah, oh my God. I'm thorough thigh that fucking la shit. We get lazy by the end of the sentence and you can't even finish the word. Oh my God. That's my favorite. You're what? My favorite. Your your favorite? Favorite. Favorite? Yeah. Rit. Not Raw as my favorite anyways, so she wasn't really like that. You know what she was, it's the way fucking, I don't know, I can't speak for other countries, but the way this country is right now where everybody is just so fucking sue happy, she can't even express concern or like a sorrow or apology apologetic, whatever that fucking word is in whatever tents and supposed to use that. She can't express it because she's worried about a

Speaker 1:          00:59:20       fucking, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       yeah. Incriminating yourself. Like we're just going to sue the shit out of her because of, cause my girlfriends got bit, you know, and all I'm trying to do is find out if it has rabies. And my girlfriend told me that the dog was either black and white or brown and black turned out was brown and black that she said, and I couldn't remember what the fuck she said. And I knew that she had two dogs and now I can't say to her the black and white one. And then she'd be like, I don't have one. You have the wrong dog. [inaudible] you just fucking a unintimidated me and that she slams the fucking door. So anyway, so I had to figure it out. They had fucking rabies. Long story short then you know, and then I got to call Nick and say, ah, you know, remember how we were going to do that three seconds ago.

Speaker 1:          01:00:01       Well since then my dog almost got raped and my girlfriend got a chunk of her leg taken out so she's got to go get a tetanus shot. Whatever. Long story short was, I cleaned up the fucking cut, you know, little peroxide, little bass Treyson I'd fucking covered the shit up. And then it went back up the street cause I realized I didn't even get their names and their phone numbers and crap. And I know that the doctors are going to be like, well did you get proof that it doesn't have rabies? So I had to do that and the next time I went up the street, the husband was there and he was actually cool as hell. He said, sorry about that. Uh,

Speaker 9:          01:00:30       don't worry about it. You know, I'll pay for the trip to the hospital and that's all I wanted to hear. You know, not trying to get in a second Prius out of a Goddamn nip on, on the inside, you know of a kneecap. I'm not trying to do that but I understand. I understand why the fuck they did it. But that's basically the reason why um, the reason why that uh, Nicholas isn't on it. And this week I'm going to try, I'm going to actually try to hook up and do a very special version. You might, you might get lucky. It's either going to be next Monday or maybe sometime this week you might get lucky. Am I doing next to one? Uh, and if I am going to do an extra one, just keep checking in with the uh, the Mlm, podcast.com the second I've, I figured out that we are going to do what I will let, I will let you know the powers that be know over on that page and uh, they will put it up and you'll have the inside fucking scoops. So maybe you'll get something on a Thursday or a Friday this week.

Speaker 1:          01:01:23       Huh?

Speaker 9:          01:01:24       How much you guys love in life? It's a short work week.

Speaker 9:          01:01:28       Well you gotta do is Olympia way through fucking Tuesday through Friday. You might get an extra podcast with sliding into June here. Good Times, good fucking ties. But I was really looking forward to, uh, I was actually watching a ton. If you get, if you guys for some reason are familiar with nick, uh, Swarts and you really should just youtube some of his stuff and then go out by all this comedy DVDs because like I said, I'm not putting anybody on this podcast that I don't think is a, you know, is fucking hilarious. And I was seriously watching his stuff just fucking die laughing by myself. Even like the quick little videos that he makes, he's just, he's hilarious. And I'm renting a, that's your homework assignment this week. Rent Grandma's boy. So you're up to speed and a or any of the other ones that he's in, but grandma's boy, it seems like he has the most lines in it.

Speaker 9:          01:02:18       And uh, I don't know. He's got a bunch of movies coming out. God dammit. I had a fucking movie star coming on despite what my girlfriend, thanks. And I was just me sitting here under my goddamn ceiling fan again. So anyways. Yeah. So what do you guys disappointed? It's just me again. I understand that. Think I'm fucking thrilled. Thought I'd get a God damn week off somebody else talk. Somebody else talk for a while, do some shit jokes. Um, anyways, anyway. Oh, I got an email this week. Um, remember the old Douche bag of the week award number that I haven't given one of those out in awhile. Um, I got this really bizarre email from somebody the other day. He said, uh, it said, hey man, I sent you an email about a year ago and it was something to the effect of, fuck you, you really turned into a pussy, et cetera.

Speaker 9:          01:03:16       I think though that I was wrong for saying that I will continue listening to your podcast and look and looking forward to any new shit you come out with. Um, I wasn't thrilled with your California dog loving bullshit. I mean, we all love dogs, but we really don't, don't all talk about it. You know, this is like one of these guys. This is what fucking annoying me about those emails. You know, those people where they realize they're wrong and then they apologize to you and it starts off as, as an apology and then you quickly realize that it's really just an excuse to start reiterating the shit that fucking pissed you off to begin with. Hey, listen, dude, uh, you know, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah. Listen, man, I got am I got, don't know. I was in, I was in a bad mood yesterday.

Speaker 9:          01:04:01       I was, you know, I've been dealing with flood of stuff, a lot of personal stuff and I, I just figured, you know, I just, I just want to say sorry. You know, I, uh, got a little out of line yesterday and, um, I, you know, it was totally my fault and nothing to do with you, you know, uh, just, you know, you're doing that faggy shit that I can't stand, you know, acting like it was like, wait a minute. Whoa, Whoa, wait, what? This is an appalling, just stop right there to say you fucking sorry. Don't, don't, don't bring it around again and start shitting on me. So the guy's like, you know, but fuck it. Everyone's entitled to their own opinions, speech, et Cetera. What the fuck ever. I will think it's cool. You actually write people back now. He's being nice to me again.

Speaker 9:          01:04:43       And you're also out there. I actually like your material. Thanks again. You know, and you won't really annoyed me about his fucking email is that he wrote I'm back. That was the name of the title. Like I'm actually like, I fucking like, he's the only guy who shits on me in emails. Like I've been sitting around going, gee, whatever happened to that guy. I don't even remember when this fucking happened. Why not? Why couldn't you just fucking come back and start a listening to the podcast? I don't give a shit what you're doing. I mean, he told me to go fuck myself. A called me a pussy, you know? Do you know how many of those I get? The only one I remember was with somebody gave me shit for supporting. So take two for taking the side of a celebrity. He was like supporting celebrities and what the fuck did he said, uh,

Speaker 1:          01:05:34       fuck you. Bye.

Speaker 9:          01:05:36       Like he was all done with me and I just wrote back, alright, take it easy.

Speaker 1:          01:05:47       And I just cracked it.

Speaker 9:          01:05:49       We up. The people are so like, you know, I'm the supposed to be the guy that thinks the world is wrapped around him, not you.

Speaker 1:          01:05:56       Right?

Speaker 9:          01:05:59       I mean, these people make me feel better about myself. It's fucking guys think like, you know. Yeah. Listen, I know you're still fucking, uh, you know, emotionally distraught about that time. I told you, go fuck yourself in November of 2006. I don't remember that.

Speaker 1:          01:06:15       All right.

Speaker 9:          01:06:16       Or if you're going to apologize, just apologize. Just sales guys kind of being a cunt. Sorry about that. All right.

Speaker 9:          01:06:23       And then, and then just fucking star. Listen again. I don't eat Annalise and you listen to your fucking explanations. Douche bag of the week right there. God bless you. Welcome back, sir. Welcome back. Okay. And you became part of the podcast. Is that stroke your ego? Hope you get run over by that fire truck at the end of the parade. Today. I never understood the fire truck. Is that because it's always during the day and they don't have money for fireworks or you couldn't really see the fireworks? So in the end they got to have those poor fucking firemen in their raincoats sweating their asses off. Huh? Sweating off that fucking hooker funk that half of them have on their body, those heroes. That's one thing I've learned about firemen after talking to the cops. Firemen love hookers. They love him. You know? I'm telling you right now, half the time you see a fucking fire truck going down the street. Half the time they go on and get hookers. So what they're doing, I think they have all those extra seats. Why do you think they have that? That debt fucking intense. Look in their face.

Speaker 1:          01:07:29       The site, the site, they're going to go get their dick sucked. You know what was the last time you even saw a fire? Every fucking three seconds. You see a fire truck going down the Damn Street. There's no fire. They're getting hookers, but everybody comes down on the cops. Happy

Speaker 9:          01:07:51       Memorial Day, everybody. I'm winging this one. I'm winging this one. I thought I was going to ask somebody else talk for the entire fucking time. Um, you know, in my, my youtube research, everybody, when I was sitting there in my lab coat, my safety goggles doing youtube research, um, you know, lately we've been talking about, you know, bad covers and people actually started sending me some covers that were bad, but they actually thought were good. Like A, there's some Ukrainian group that does like this sort of a, I don't know what it is, old school, old school, like European folk, um, version of highway to hell. So just search Ukrainian highway to hell, you know, the Malcolm and Angus parts or run an accordion and Phil Rudd's part is basically an empty suitcase and somebody hitting a, an empty water bottle against it and somehow it's actually pretty bad ass, pretty bad ass.

Speaker 9:          01:08:45       Those guys, like they really, they bring a great energy to it and I gotta admit, I kind of enjoyed it because you would think it would be a train wreck. So that's your first video to watch Ukrainian highway to hell. And, um, anyway, so I was kind of looking up that uh, that some of that surf guitar stuff and uh, they all use those fender strats and I got one of those this year and I was never really a fan. I always like the Gibson sound with the Marshall amp cause I, you know Zeppelin Ac DC like that's what I came up on. You know Joe Perry always had that 59 Les Paul, he used, you know the deal and um, I don't know. I was into the beach boys for like two seconds and then they just annoyed the shit out of me. Um, but I don't know, just trying to learn how to play guitar.

Speaker 9:          01:09:28       I grabbed, you know, he listened to a little blues. It's funny when you go back and listen to those old blues guys like Lightening Hopkins is can, you know, called lightening cause he was so fast and compared to how fast guys are today, he's not that fast. So you kind of go back to those guys because you can at least figure out the rhythm. I'm just explaining if anybody out there is trying to learn how to play guitar, I'm really trying to learn how to play by ear. So I'm not like one of those Douche bags you see on youtube where somebody shows you how to play the guitar, but in they still want the tabs, you know what I mean? Um, so anyways, so then I graduated to two other Surf Guitar and like I said, he's a lot of the thought of the rips are all on one string.

Speaker 9:          01:10:07       But what I noticed in it was a, I came across this group called the shadows and they got a song called Fbi and you just have to see the synchronized dancing, the choreography that they're doing. Um, you know, you guys can keep sending me the bad covers. But a whole nother level of funny is some of the bad choreography because nowadays when you look at the choreography that people do, it's like a, I mean the, the, the dancers nowadays are so good. They'll have 20 people on stage and you're watching them and they're all moving. They're doing the exact same move at the exact same time. And back then in the 60s it was basically, as long as you were doing the same movement within three seconds of the person to either side of you, it was considered a, it's considered, I guess, decent. So check out a search shadows, FBI, this is some of the worst choreography I've seen.

Speaker 9:          01:11:11       And a, if you want some heavy metal, this is a whole nother genre and I haven't even tip even even like tapped the surface of this. Look up Brittany Fox and Brittany's B R I t n y Fox girls' school live. And just watch the first 10 seconds of their stupid and back and forth that I thought was fucking cool as hell. I literally saw it and was like, oh my God, this is, this is, uh, I was like, oh my God. No. I was like, I literally said, Oh my God, I know a fucking ditzy girls have ruined saying, oh my God. But it used to exist, you know, like when you saw a Zeppelin fucking burning back to the goddamn earth with people on fire jumping out of it. Oh, that was all the humanity. Um, and then the last one isn't even synchronized dancing.

Speaker 9:          01:12:00       But this is the main reason why it took me so long. And I never really got into Dave Matthews was that stupid dance, that White Guy, James Brown fucking dance that Dave Matthews used to do. Just search Dave Matthews dance and it's, it's, you know, you really just want John Belushi to come back from the dead and do that animal house scene where he smashes the guy's guitar except you really want, I'm just hit Dave right over his fucking head. And the only reason why I ever got in to listening to Dave Matthews was, uh, their drummer. And then I really liked, there was a saxophone solo that I just thought was the shit on one of their earlier, uh, earlier ones. Other than that, I just, I don't know, I just haven't been into them. So you know a few, you know now, right there. That's a lot of work. That's a lot of shit to go look up.

Speaker 9:          01:12:57       What? You know what? Why don't you take the express checkout line? Okay. The automated checkout line and just go to the [inaudible] podcast.com we'll have all those fucking videos right up there. You can watch them. We'll have them in order. The highway to hell, right? The Dave Matthews, I mean very little times in life. Do what would I ever be on the side of a bully, but I swear to God if right in the middle of his dance, if the stereotypical high school football player walked up to him with his jersey, still on with two of his other meathead friends and they just stuffed them into some locker that they brought on stage and smashed his guitar, you could hear me laughing from the back of the fucking stadium that they were playing. I would completely enjoy it and I don't know what that says about me. Oh, we're 34 minutes in.

Speaker 9:          01:13:45       I want to give a shout out to all the joggers on the treadmill. You only got another word or another fucking 13 minutes left. 13 minutes left. All right. How smelly is the person next to you? You know, are you on a treadmill right now? You know what I love is those, those fucking people who don't even need to do cardio and yet they still get on the machines and they always get on like that. That old school stair master, you know those people who just cheat? They have like a magazine open in their reading and then they'll look, they'll like hunched over looking like a question mark and that just sort of moving their feet like flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip, flip that. It's like, what do, what are you doing? Are you trying to burn fat off of your ankles? Is that all you're doing?

Speaker 9:          01:14:28       You're not doing anything. You have full makeup on? Maybe that's just La. Do you know one time I was at the gym, I'm actually going to go outside the outside the bounds of a, this podcast. I actually did. I'm going to, I'm going to sort of name a name here. I was on a, I was on the fucking the elliptical, you know, cause I want to have a hip replacement when I'm 55. I wanted to dual the fucking Earl Campbell special. That's what the fuck I want. Right? Actually like don't, I don't universe. I don't. Okay. I've learned that. Be careful what you say your word is your wand. Um, so I'm at the fucking gym. All right. And uh, there's this girl in front of me, this beautiful girl, but she's got tattoos all over a cell phone. I'm just going, why the fuck did this gorgeous girl get all those goddamn tattoos right there.

Speaker 9:          01:15:18       Fucking sweatpants. They're hanging down. They can see about a 16th of an inch of fucking ass crack. And I'm just going like that girl, I swear to God, if you just erased all those tattoos, okay. And you put her in a address that that showed off, you know, the beauty of a woman, but it wasn't trashy. Like this girl is like a classy gorgeous woman. Right. But she didn't know. She said you met sweating, fucking sweat pants hanging off her and everything. And like four days later, she's in the exact same one. I'm fucking sitting there, I'm doing the elliptical. There she is against sweat pants hanging off and just so happened I was done before and I'm walking by or cause I gotta go, you know, get the little fucking bottle of whatever and spray down the machine I just used, I looked at her and it was a, Oh, this is such a Kathy Griffin moment.

Speaker 9:          01:16:11       I can't add Jesus. I, you know, I can't tell. I can't fucking name names that would, that would ruin the podcast. All right, I can't do that. I can't do that. I'll fucking annoying is that I couldn't do it. Kathy Griffin has already ruined the reputation of redheads. No one's ever going to trust us with this secret again. She fucking hangs out with famous people, right? And they're all going, oh wow. Isn't this cool? I'm hanging out with a fucking comedian. And then she goes on TV and rats out everything. Then she picked her nose and I was like, ah man, God, Michael Landon just picked his fucking nose. I know he's dead.

Speaker 9:          01:16:47       What the fuck? Right. So what am I going to do? I'm going to do that on my podcast. I can't do it. All right. I gave you enough of a description. There's a beautiful girl with way too many tattoos. Figure it out, you know. Do you know any movie stars who are beautiful with way too many tattoos? You don't. All right, so now out we're out of the movies. It wasn't a musician to TV star. Beautiful. Too many tattoos. There you go. You figure out what, are you laughing at me or am I totally given it away? Now I'm not, I don't name names.

Speaker 9:          01:17:33       She just said you're ridiculous. The amateur thrill I get because I have no idea if I'm making people laugh. If you actually left knee, I know that I'm not wasting my time here. Yeah, let's see that. I just got an AH, um, all right. What am I reading here? Uh, all right. He did anybody notice last week when you watch that, that Sabbath fan going crazy? How much he sounded like he could do a dead on Sam Kinison. I really thought that that guy was awesome. Somebody actually sent me in a fucking hilarious email going like, come on bill, you think that that because I said that that guy is actually probably a parent cause he's at that age. And he was like, dude, do you really think anybody's fucking that guy? I mean look at him. And uh, I would say this, if there was an even amount of men and women on this planet, I would say that he would be in trouble.

Speaker 9:          01:18:25       All right? There would be a pussy shortage in his life that would rival what the fuck we went through in the early seventies with the gas, with the, with the gas crunch. All right. There was a long fucking way to go. Um, but no, fortunately there's three women to every one guy. So as a man, if you're dating a loser chick or someone who's just a total content, you really have no excuse. But women, they actually, they have an excuse, you know, when they say a good man is hard to find out that they're right. I would think a man would be hard to find if there's fucking, you know, you know, three who has every fucking a hang down there paying down over there, you know? All right, let's read this fucking question here on, you know what? I don't want to do that. I don't want to do, I don't want to do that just yet.

Speaker 9:          01:19:12       Beautiful woman, not a movie star with a lot of tet, not a musician. She also does not own an ice cream store. Okay. That's it. I'm done with it. I'm done with the hints. Um, anyways, and I'm not going to confirm or deny him either, but I do know the answer, Huh? He like, I just went political. It was one of the greatest quotes ever heard some lawyer for some fucking guy or worked in Congress or whatever the fuck it was. Came walking out and they go, they go, is it true that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And this guy just looked at the camera. He goes, I can neither confirm nor denied it. I can either. I fucked it up. He goes, I can neither confirm nor deny that, but I do know the answer. And he walked away. All right. Put that one in your back pocket.

Speaker 9:          01:19:58       Next time you're in a fucking jam. When the cops are asking you a question when your girlfriend or lay your, oh, you're cheating on me. You know, give her Bruce Willis. Look from die hard. Just look over your shoulder and then just do that. Alec Baldwin sort of whisper. I can neither confirm nor deny that, but I do know the answer. And then just sort of look off right over a shoulder, staring at something and don't break a gaze and just walk right by the side of her face. And I'll tell you, yeah, you completely mind fucked you. You know, you mind fucked her. Okay. And then run down to the corner and try when the fucking fire trucks come down the street, grab the side and jump on. Go down the street. Get yourself a blow job. Celebrate Memorial Day weekend. All right, let's get into the questions for this week.

Speaker 9:          01:20:44       Um, I want to remind me to talk about the 1958 Oldsmobile 88. That's my new fucking car, you know, fuck it. You know what? I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna put some pictures up there and some of my favorite old cars and uh, the Malibu, the fucking Chevy impalas, those early 60 Chevy impalas, the Lincoln continental error, JFK getting his brains blown out. That fucking Eric car. The uh, I have never been a big Oldsmobile guy. Even like the muscle cars. For me it was either the Mustang and there was certain years of the, uh, certain years of the um, the Camaro that I really liked. Like as much as I liked the late sixties one, I think that 19 seventy's Camaro where they get like death fucking sharp nose on it is the meanest looking God damn car. And it's got the corvette round brake lights, the cars, the shit and always seem like whenever, I don't know, cause it was a little bigger.

Speaker 9:          01:21:42       It always just seemed like the gear heads always figure out how to put like some fucking 700 cubic fucking whatever the fuck. I don't know about engines. They put a Goddamn jet engine in the thing. Oh, and here's another thing too. Jay Leno, I'm fucking obsessed with his car collection and I'm always going on his website. Jay Leno's garage or whatever. We'll have the link on the [inaudible] podcast.com. Um, he has a fucking look up Jay Leno. Here's another youtube video. Look up Jay Leno tank car, this fucking maniac. But uh, uh, an engine, he took it out of a tank, never get dentally Chrysler Dodge made it cause it's a Hemi, but it's like a fucking 58 cylinder and he made a hot rod out of it and open wheel hot rod. The fucking car is like, I swear to God, it's like 25 feet long. It's longer than the 58 continental right near one of the longest production cars of all time.

Speaker 9:          01:22:42       I was actually talking to my dad about all cars. He knows all about old cars. You know, he used to do that when we were kids all the time. Be driving down the street. We see a car [inaudible] car. I'd be like, dad is a 1955 Buick special at a three 50 God, that was a beautiful car. That's all we always ended with guy. That was a beautiful car actually, when one time watching one of those Dudley movies where he plays a drunk and you know, he drives his Rolls Royce and he comes screeching in hammered and he rear ends another car. And my dad loves cars so much. He's literally watching it and as, as the dude is coming in in that screeching in the car and it's so clear, he's going to hit a fire hydrant or whatever with that, that $5,000 grill, remember that 16 candles?

Speaker 9:          01:23:27       You got five grand and I've got five grand, right? He comes flying. My Dad is literally going, making that noise, you know, liquid. Something precious is going to break and it fuck he rear ends the car. Then my dad's like, well, why did they have to do that? I'm just sitting there laughing. Go ahead dad. It's probably a fake Royal Rolls Royce, you know? And he goes, yes, but I know, but whatever the fuck that means. My Dad's hilarious and he and I and I, whatever is in his DNA about loving cars from the 50s, forties and, and uh, the 60s I got that. I don't know what happened. I tapped into that shit. But like I said, I'd never been an Oldsmobile guy, but there is a fucking 1958 Oldsmobile 88 that this guy really did. That is um, it's gold and uh, just if those front four headlights, it's amazing because the Chevy's went from, from two headlights to, for between 57 and 58.

Speaker 9:          01:24:29       And I always hated that. I hated how the Bel Air looked cause it just ended up looking like a checker cab. I like the 55 to 57 Bel air when it had the single head light. We want to just the classic, you know, from Memorial Day American car designs, how the fuck we went to that. And I was actually thinking, you know, I have a kid here, you know, am I really going to drive down the street going, that's a fucking 1987 Chevy Lumina. God, that was a beautiful car. I'm not even gonna know what the fuck it was. Ford Astro. I'm not going to know what it was. They all look the same, but back then they had like, it was a man like, you know what I liked about the cars back then, and I might be wrong here because this is a, you know, like I said, I'm not, I'm not a fucking mechanic obviously and shit, but like back then the way they had things broken down was, you know, nowadays like, um, I like how can I put this like it like Toyota, we'll make everything from uh, from a, uh, like a Prius, low end car.

Speaker 9:          01:25:35       Like what? I drive all the way up to a high end car that'll still say Toyota. I know they have Lexus and all that, but Toyota we'll make like a, like a 50,000, $60,000 car and they'll make like an 18,000, $20,000 current and all. It's all under the brand name. Toyota, we're back in the day as far as my understanding of it was Canada. They went Cadillac, Buick, Oldsmobile, Plymouth, Chevrolet, and Chevy's were like bottom and cars, you know, and then if you drove up, it's, it was like the status was like, what? Uh, what make you a drive? And I believe, at least that's the way I kind of understand if you drove a Chevy, you kind of a young guy, you know, um, making your way up the ladder and you go back to your high school reunion and be like, what? What's he driving?

Speaker 9:          01:26:25       Striving a Plymouth, a fucking shitty was driving a Chevy in high school. The fuck, how old is he? You know, but if you, if you got up to, you know, Buick and Oldsmobile, you're doing are right, but if you're driving a Cadillac, you will fucking run and shit. And I think that work the same way with like Chrysler where when Chrysler, the Sodo Plymouth and then dodge, I don't know, I just remember when I was in, when I was sitting and was in a bar in Colorado and they had this old school poster that said, buy your wife a Chevy, which is funny. It's like, Hey, buy one of those low end cars that'll shut her the fuck up. Probably doesn't even mean that. It's just how my chauvinist stick mine took dead. Anyways, let's, let's, uh, well, well, we'll have a picture of like, I'll say like, uh, like three or four of my most favorite American cars in celebration of a memorial day weekend and all the troops, you know, uh, you know what I mean?

Speaker 9:          01:27:19       I can barely handle being in Arizona. I don't know how the fuck I would ever survive. You know, if I was ever going to go to war, I should have gone to war back in the day when we were, uh, well, I guess we used to fight in the tropics. Jesus Christ. That would have been, you know, I probably could do they let red heads into the fucking army. You probably, that's is it, can I get a deferment for having no pigment? I've never seen an albino marine, you know what I mean? Can I get, that's like having flat feet. I've got a bad back. I'm a red head. What? W what are you going to stick me? All right. You want to fucking have hand to hand combat and Greenland? I'm there baby. I'm fucking right there. I'll have a knife from my teeth. I'll take out a polar bear. I swear to God I won't cower. And my little fucking Igloo crying is someone else's going private Burke. Get your shit together. I don't want to go out there. It's scary me. I am killing with you this week.

Speaker 9:          01:28:21       I'm fucking funny today. See how women, they always got to clarify it. Why can't you just say your fucking funny? I'm funny today. You know what? That's what God made you. So beautiful. You'd come in here with your hair looking all glamorous. I was really mad at you twice. I saw you come walking in here like some old school movie star. See that? See how I do that? I insult him and then I quickly compliment him and then I get the yard. What do you have in your hand? I am. That's why you like me and women like the assholes they do, right? Cause you know we know how to fuck. Wow.

Speaker 9:          01:28:57       Anyways. Oh, whatever. I'm shit talking. It's a holiday. Somebody rubbing my balls. Drinking a beer in a minute cause I'm an American. You think I'm going to read, I'm not that extra day. Going to get dumber. That's what I'm doing and be puking in a fucking BFI. Been behind Dennis. All right, here we go. Um, here's a question for a week, a bill. Let me start by saying this. This question stems from event spanning over the last six years or so. About six years ago at the age of 20, I was about a year and a half into what at the time seem to be a really great relationship. Coincidentally, my job and money situation was also doing really well. Um, so I decided instead of throwing my money away on rent, I buy a house. There you go. This guy's making the moves. He's doing well in life. He's buying a house.

Speaker 9:          01:29:47       Everything's good. So far, being that I always plan ahead. I purchased a rather nice house for a first home, even though I thought, uh, he said, even thought I knew it, even though I knew it was a little too much money. Um, now I didn't decide I didn't buy this to start a family or for her. I just wanted a fucking house. I'm in the year or so after the relationship really went downhill, mainly because I was working more in spending less time and money on her. Um, okay. Uh, long story short, we split about two years later. Since then, I've had many encounters with girls. Okay. So let me, let me fix this with my awful reading. All right. Basically, this guy's dating a girl. He's making good money. He doesn't want to throw his money down the toilet, pay in rent. So he goes and he buys in house and then now he's got a nut to fucking crack.

Speaker 9:          01:30:40       Every month he works a little bit more. He's not spending time with his woman and it goes downhill. Plus he's younger. That's pretty normal, except the fact that he owns a house. So now he's in this situation, he's single. He has this really nice house and this is what's been happening since. All right. Since then, I've had many encounters with girls. The one thing they have all had in common is their hatred and animosity towards my ex-girlfriend and my house. I've even heard them say things about sleeping in a bed I bought with her or how they don't like it that I did all this with uh, with the other girl. I'd been dating a girl for about two years now and she's the same way. Uh, she even has problems with my dogs because she says they were her dogs, meaning the ex. My question is this, why is it never good enough?

Speaker 9:          01:31:28       Well, if you're a fan of this podcast, you've already asked that question, but I think it's timeless. So I'm going to, that's why I'm reading this again. Am I supposed to start my life over every time I want to begin a new relationship or is it that girls are really always want to have what they can. They cannot have half the country nowadays are just waiting for some guy to put them up in a house and take care of everything. But when you give them the chance, the they bitch because they didn't get to pick the fucking drapes.

Speaker 9:          01:32:00       Ah, this guy's making some good points near, I'm going to need your help pair. He said, uh, I don't, uh, I don't get it. I've done really well for myself and I've done it on my own. None of that had anything to do with who I was dating at the time. And I hate the feeling bad because I'm trying to make, because I'm trying to better myself. What's your take? All right, Nia, what, what did you say on this? You actually summed it up really well here. What do you, what do you think about this guy? Just to, just to reiterate, you know, the deal. What, what, what is, uh, what is his problem?

Speaker 5:          01:32:29       I think the problem is the kind of people that he dates cause I don't think that there mature enough. So like let go of the past, you know what I mean? It's like, of course he's dated other women, of course. You know what I mean? It's not, yeah, but let me ask you this. If, if when I met you already had a house, right.

Speaker 9:          01:32:48       And uh, it was, you know, it had a little bit of the female touch to it, you know what I mean? Yeah. You know what I mean? It's not like you walked in and there was just a coffee table and like fucking a playstation, you know, popcorn in the cushions or whatever. Right. I'm not saying this house looks like that, but you know.

Speaker 5:          01:33:02       Right. Yeah. No. If it looked like, and I still had the bed that I used to bang the other one me, then I'll say at least she can do it. Dude, you can least switch out the bed. You know what I mean? Bed though. I thought, I think that's a little, I think that's a little much, honestly. What a little much to still have it. Yeah. He's going to buy it. Do you? How much bets? Cause you don't have him buy a whole new bed just cause he's slept with somebody else on it. Ladies. Can you see why this is my girl? You're the shit. Yeah, because I mean how many, when you're dating somebody and you have sex with them in their house, chances are they've had sex with somebody else in their bed before you anyway. So now all of a sudden it's like a big deal because no, he needs to date some more mature girls, but he's been dating someone for two years. I don't know what he's been doing. I thought you said he, I just focus on saying the words, right?

Speaker 5:          01:33:54       Yeah. He says, you know what? You know what this, this house could be like the lock, the lock, the door test in them in a Bronx tale. Oh yeah, that's true. Yeah. Like if they can't deal with it and they start giving me shit and you give him the heave Ho. Exactly. I think they should get the heave Ho this is my house. This is where I fuck you want in the, not quite so asshole. But if anything he could, you know, get some new sheets or something, you know, obviously. Yeah, the bed bath and beyond. I was thinking about some new sheets. You want to help me pick out? Some girl would love that. Love it. Yeah. There you go. Yeah, there you go. Yeah, and what point in the relationship should he do that? You know, cause we don't like being tied down. I want to send the wrong message. I don't want to say that I love you, but I want you to still bang me. Like at what point? I think when it's like official date, like a monogamous type thing is when you can say, hey, let's you know. Okay. All right. That's really, you answered the question, don't oversell it. You answered it. It gets really annoying that these girls would be like, oh my God, I can't

Speaker 9:          01:34:58       believe you that you know this is already decorated and these are her dogs and this is her house. And I can tell that she said that there. That's stupid. That's really how la girls say. Favorite after that fabric. All right. All right. I think that's going to be the podcast this week. So I guess so that's your answer right there when you know, I'm not going to always defer those, uh, Tinea, but I just think sometimes you're really asking me what women are thinking and I think I've done enough trashing of women and uh, shut up. Um, I've done enough trash, one of them. And you know, that's actually a serious question here because still you don't want to get that in a situation where, I mean you have to, I mean literally sell the house. What if it's a bad fucking market just to appease her.

Speaker 9:          01:35:48       That's ridiculous. But, uh, I, I w I, you know something, yeah, I would actually say that if they were actually going to be getting married, you know, if they take it to that level and uh, there'll be a weird thing because when you do get married and you want to pick out a house, it's the house that for both of you that you want to live in. And you know, this houses out there that I just don't get like that though. You know that gingerbread looking house sits up to fucking street? Yeah. Like you know, if I met the girl and my dreams and she lived in that house and every everyday driving, ah, I hate this fucking house. You know all those ones that look like the castles, that employee. But they're, they're just a house so it looks stupid. You know, Rapunzel let down your hair or just sort of hop out that window.

Speaker 9:          01:36:35       No, I, I do. I know, I respect that, but I'm saying I, this is what I was saying like, you know, come on in and live here. I get that. But then you know, I'm sure we didn't buy a house that's big enough to have like a, like a big family. I don't know if he does. I don't know. I'm just trying to kind of balance it out. Allow, what the fuck am I trying to do? Nia, are you going to be designated driver? Because I'm going to get hammered today. A drag. Why? I was designated driver last time. Last time when last time. Last time, like fucking three weeks ago when we were in Boston. And you guys all got Hamad is they say, oh yeah, we're going to somebody. We don't know these people. We can't go get hammered. I can. I'm going to, you know, my mission is I'm going to make you look good today. I'm going to, you're going to people gonna feel bad for you. No, I don't want that.

Speaker 9:          01:37:25       We'll figure it out. Come on then I send you those songs that I make up. You don't want to get drunk. Yeah. Be Fun. I'll be, I'll be asleep halfway, halfway with my mouth open. Looking like the ass hole next to you on a fucking transcontinental flight. All right. That's it. Happy Memorial Day to everybody. Sorry. The uh, nick Swardson thing didn't work out. I'm going to try to sneak in an extra podcast this week. Um, I'm, I'm going to figure this shit out. Okay? I promised you a movie, goddammit. I'm going to bring you one and a, that's it. A Happy Memorial Day to everybody. Have a nice, safe, happy holiday. Get to where the fuck you going to be at and just start boozing. All right. Okay. Don't be that asshole. I'm fine. I'm fine. You're not fine. All right. Two Sec. You, you have grass stains on your face. Okay. You're not fine. Have you been drinking tonight? I had a couple Saad hanging off your fucking left here. All right, everybody, that's it. Have a great weekend and a happy holiday and

Speaker 7:          01:38:32       ah, that's it. God bless the troops. Okay.
