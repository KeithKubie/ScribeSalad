1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
It's one of the cool things about travel,
right?

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,430
You broaden your perspective and your
understanding of what it means to be a

3
00:00:05,431 --> 00:00:08,580
person. Go to these different
environments and yourself too. Yeah, yeah.

4
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:11,280
There are different and they're
different foods or different art.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:15,300
There are different architecture and he
goes, oh, this is also possible to, yes,

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,040
people can live like this.
Yes.

7
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,980
And do you even begin to see why
they live like that? You know,

8
00:00:19,981 --> 00:00:23,580
like you initially you go to Greece
and you have resin flavored wine,

9
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,410
you have it at Siena and a,

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,040
you wondering why would these crazy
Greeks put pine resin in there ruining

11
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:32,520
perfectly good white wine. And then
after awhile you start to say, Hey,

12
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:35,940
actually this is pretty good. Uh, you
know, this is not a crazy thing after all.

13
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:40,200
And he acquired case. Yes.
You know, the first time,

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,640
the first time I had
scotch whiskey, I, I, uh,

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,760
I didn't know what I thought about
it. And now I love whiskey. Right.

16
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:50,880
It's an acquired taste. So the first
time you drink something like that,

17
00:00:50,881 --> 00:00:52,360
you think, you know?
Yes. They put resident,

18
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,660
they put pine resin in their white wine.
They chill it.

19
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,300
I should've brought you some.
Maybe I'll send you on an acquired taste.

20
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,140
What's not Ouzo Koolaid. It's delicious.
Just from the beginning. Yeah.

21
00:01:01,141 --> 00:01:05,610
I just write out a job cold
and it's a sweet good. Yes,

22
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,160
yes, yes. We'll have to convince
anybody. Yes, that's right. That's right.

23
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:12,360
Somethings that's right.

24
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:15,120
Some things are just good right
out of the budget is good. Yes.

25
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,390
Koolaid is just good. Yeah. I mean, I
don't recommend you drink it all the time.

26
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:22,070
It's full of Shit. It's terrible for
you. But damn, this stuff, it's like,

27
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,370
it's like a, it's like fried
foods, you know? Yeah, sure. Yummy.

28
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,810
A lot of them. Yeah. French
fries. Yes. I mean, come on
man. Salt and catch up. Yeah,

29
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:34,050
I like that line. I like that. No, I'm uh,

30
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,800
I'm not sure about what I should mention,
but anyway,

31
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:41,760
I love Popeye's fried chicken. I do
as well. I love it so bad. It's awful.

32
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:45,790
And my wife, my wife is unlikely to
listen to this full podcast, so, or I'll,

33
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:48,210
I'll skip over this part so she
doesn't hear this part, but,

34
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,850
and my sister will be listening probably,

35
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:55,020
and so she will laugh when she gets to
this part because whenever I see about my

36
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:59,520
eyes, I just pull over and indulge
myself and then I terrible. Terrible.

37
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:01,040
The top eyes is good,
but you know what?

38
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,170
If you really want to indulge
and you like chicken. Yeah.

39
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:08,570
Roscoe's is [inaudible]. No, you
don't know. No, I don't know.

40
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,230
Chicken and waffles. Oh Dude. I tried
to go the chicken and waffle family.

41
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,000
We tried it.
Don't you make that face?

42
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,140
Tried to go there the other day with
my family on a Sunday, hour and a half.

43
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:23,580
Wait on the same plate. Sunday chicken
and walls course on the same plate.

44
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,660
What are you a communist? Yeah, man, it's,

45
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:30,870
it's La Syrup on them to
hell. Yeah. And butter. Yeah.

46
00:02:30,871 --> 00:02:34,470
You mean the shooting is put
it on there. Yes. It perfectly.

47
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,600
It's this damn delicious in my
mind. You're from another planet. I,

48
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,840
I make maple syrup.
I live in Vermont and I make Maple Syrup.

49
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:46,440
I tap my own trees and, wow. What a
freak I have. I have a, yeah, exactly.

50
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:50,280
Giving people a hard time for waffles
and chicken again. The colonel,

51
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,860
the colonel is a liar. He does
not have it. Get out of here.

52
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,490
It's not even the colonel.
The colonel is norm Macdonald's.

53
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,120
I saw it's not no.
The old one kernel.

54
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,510
It's normally very like promotion or
something. That is nonsense. Yeah.

55
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,380
But they do not,
oh my gosh.

56
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:11,390
I can waffle syrup goes on top of the
chicken that chicken and waffles and

57
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,650
chicken tastes like cat litter compared
to Roscoe's. Also sweet chick La.

58
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:18,430
He could try to get this
out of here. Uh, so, uh,

59
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:22,600
it's stuff can go fuck off Roscoe's
chicken and waffles and you get the Greens

60
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:27,070
to the Collard Greens. Collard Greens.
Yeah, that's fine. Damn good. That's fine.

61
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:28,600
But that's a waste of maple syrup.

62
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,660
Take it from a man who makes it up to
put her sweet chick is good. I'm sure.

63
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:35,650
Sweet. It's not this place. I get it.
I love it. I've been there. It's great.

64
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,080
Roscoe's. Okay, I'll have a look fuck off.

65
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,960
Cause the reason why there's an hour
and a half wait on a Sunday. Okay.

66
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,470
How long you in town for a just
a day babe. I'll be back though.

67
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,930
I'll be back in a couple of weeks
over there right after this show.

68
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,250
Maybe I'll go there for a little one on
Gower. Okay. Oh man, it's good. All right.

69
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,840
Maybe I'll try that.
It's so good.

70
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,960
And it's also one of those places has
been there forever. We used to get it.

71
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,370
I found out about it from 19 Oh
1994 when I was doing news radio.

72
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:04,930
95 ish I guess. Been in La since
you left the Massachusetts? No,

73
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:06,970
I went to New York for a couple
of years then I moved down here,

74
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,380
moved down here in [inaudible] 94 okay,

75
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:11,680
so you've been here a long time and
when I was on news radio they got it for

76
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:14,870
like you could order lunch
and someone ordered Roscoe,

77
00:04:14,871 --> 00:04:17,800
she became addicted and I was like,
what is this like waffles?

78
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:21,160
And it was just like you waffles and
chicken. There it looks. That's, that's,

79
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,440
that doesn't look as good as
it looks when you're there.

80
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,010
When you're there and you smell
it, it's damn good. Sorry,

81
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:29,820
I'm doing a Roscoe's commercial
here with an incredible, I'm a fan.

82
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,950
It's an incredible
combination of items based,

83
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,110
so it's so good.

84
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:39,910
And afterwards you better have nothing
to do, man, into a food coma son.

85
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:46,500
Anyway. Um, how do we get to that? W W
I know, try you. Maple Syrup stories,

86
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,960
different countries, different countries
in opening your mind. So you resident.

87
00:04:50,961 --> 00:04:51,071
Yeah.

88
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:55,670
So you are counteracting my resin flavored
white wine with these maple syrup,

89
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,760
syrup and gas chicken.
