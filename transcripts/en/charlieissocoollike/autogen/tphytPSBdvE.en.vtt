fit for me really when you think charlie
is so cool like you think submarines

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000
is so cool like you think submarines
 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.189
is so cool like you think submarines
don't you it make sense well actually

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199
don't you it make sense well actually
 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.590
don't you it make sense well actually
they also do a roadshow here in the UK

part of that they have a bunch of cool

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939
part of that they have a bunch of cool
 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.550
part of that they have a bunch of cool
experiments that they do on stage and

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560
experiments that they do on stage and
 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.220

they have been nice enough to lend me

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230
they have been nice enough to lend me

they have been nice enough to lend me
some of their experiments so I can play

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060
some of their experiments so I can play
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.640
some of their experiments so I can play
around with them and show them to you so

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650
around with them and show them to you so
 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.780
around with them and show them to you so
yeah let's get experimenting all right

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790
yeah let's get experimenting all right
 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.450
yeah let's get experimenting all right
there hello what we have here is Bell

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460
there hello what we have here is Bell
 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.970
there hello what we have here is Bell
and it's in a bell jar the jar looks

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980
and it's in a bell jar the jar looks
 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.040
and it's in a bell jar the jar looks
like a bell and that's why it's called a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050
like a bell and that's why it's called a
 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.779
like a bell and that's why it's called a
bell jar but it just also happens to

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789
bell jar but it just also happens to
 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.430
bell jar but it just also happens to
have a bell in sight here you don't

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440
have a bell in sight here you don't
 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.810
have a bell in sight here you don't
always have to put a bell in a bell jar

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820
always have to put a bell in a bell jar
 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.430
always have to put a bell in a bell jar
you know you can put whatever you want

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440
you know you can put whatever you want
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.229
you know you can put whatever you want
in whatever you want as long as it's

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239
in whatever you want as long as it's
 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.689
in whatever you want as long as it's
consensual and this turns on doesn't it

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699
consensual and this turns on doesn't it
 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.049
consensual and this turns on doesn't it
there you go that's the sound of a bell

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059
there you go that's the sound of a bell
 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.150
there you go that's the sound of a bell
it's quite annoying isn't it Gideon yes

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160
it's quite annoying isn't it Gideon yes
 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.860
it's quite annoying isn't it Gideon yes
it is Gideon - my cat just in case

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870
it is Gideon - my cat just in case
 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.959
it is Gideon - my cat just in case
you're not aware of the full context so

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969
you're not aware of the full context so
 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.509
you're not aware of the full context so
you can hear that relatively well while

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519
you can hear that relatively well while
 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.190
you can hear that relatively well while
it's underneath the bell jar but what

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200
it's underneath the bell jar but what
 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.020
it's underneath the bell jar but what
this experiment is designed to show you

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030
this experiment is designed to show you
 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.990
this experiment is designed to show you
is that sound only can travel through

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
is that sound only can travel through
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.120
is that sound only can travel through
air which is what this thing is for this

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
air which is what this thing is for this
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.270
air which is what this thing is for this
is a vacuum like a way less efficient

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280
is a vacuum like a way less efficient
 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.580
is a vacuum like a way less efficient
version of my vacuum cleaner so we're

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590
version of my vacuum cleaner so we're
 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.560
version of my vacuum cleaner so we're
gonna do is going to try and use this to

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570
gonna do is going to try and use this to
 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.690
gonna do is going to try and use this to
take the air out there and we'll see

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700
take the air out there and we'll see
 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.130
take the air out there and we'll see
what happens to the sound of the Bell

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
what happens to the sound of the Bell
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.429
what happens to the sound of the Bell
attaching it there see you can't hear

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439
attaching it there see you can't hear
 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.170
attaching it there see you can't hear
the bell because all you can hear is

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180
the bell because all you can hear is
 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.640
the bell because all you can hear is
this thing now let's just wait a while

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650
this thing now let's just wait a while
 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.219
this thing now let's just wait a while
for the air to come out of that jar and

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229
for the air to come out of that jar and
 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.580
for the air to come out of that jar and
then we'll check back in

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590
 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.090
see now really all I can hear is this

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100
see now really all I can hear is this
 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.490
see now really all I can hear is this
it's this thing let's turn that off for

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500
it's this thing let's turn that off for
 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.550
it's this thing let's turn that off for
a moment you can still hear it probably

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560
a moment you can still hear it probably
 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.630
a moment you can still hear it probably
because there's a gap in the bell jar

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640
because there's a gap in the bell jar
 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:57.730
because there's a gap in the bell jar
somewhere but if we let the air back in

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740
 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.959
still annoying alright that one did work

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969
still annoying alright that one did work
 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.910
still annoying alright that one did work
perfectly but hopefully it gave you an

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
perfectly but hopefully it gave you an
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.469
perfectly but hopefully it gave you an
idea of what was going on try another

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479
idea of what was going on try another
 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.219
idea of what was going on try another
shall we oh wow oh God

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229
shall we oh wow oh God
 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.290
shall we oh wow oh God
so a little bit less high-tech than the

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300
so a little bit less high-tech than the
 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.029
so a little bit less high-tech than the
last one but still very cool to promise

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039
last one but still very cool to promise
 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.190
last one but still very cool to promise
before I show you before your very eyes

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200
before I show you before your very eyes
 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.900
before I show you before your very eyes
how I could make this glass stick turn

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910
how I could make this glass stick turn
 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.270
how I could make this glass stick turn
invisible first we need to talk a little

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280
invisible first we need to talk a little
 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.259
invisible first we need to talk a little
bit about refraction

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269
bit about refraction
 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.240
bit about refraction
everyone loves refraction so what this

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250
everyone loves refraction so what this
 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.460
everyone loves refraction so what this
is is when light travels through a

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470
is is when light travels through a
 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.680
is is when light travels through a
specific substance like glass or water

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690
specific substance like glass or water
 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.990
specific substance like glass or water
that light is slowed down a little bit

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000
that light is slowed down a little bit
 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.850
that light is slowed down a little bit
and it causes the light to bend this is

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860
and it causes the light to bend this is
 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.680
and it causes the light to bend this is
why when I put this little glass stick

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690
why when I put this little glass stick
 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.870
why when I put this little glass stick
inside of this bowl of water it kind of

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880
inside of this bowl of water it kind of
 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.920
inside of this bowl of water it kind of
looks like it's coming into the wrong

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930
looks like it's coming into the wrong
 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.990
looks like it's coming into the wrong
angle and looks a bit bent at the bottom

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000
angle and looks a bit bent at the bottom
 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.819
angle and looks a bit bent at the bottom
and that is because of how the glass and

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:37.829
and that is because of how the glass and
 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.559
and that is because of how the glass and
the water are bending the light however

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569
the water are bending the light however
 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.930
the water are bending the light however
what might happen if we were to put

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940
what might happen if we were to put
 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.490
what might happen if we were to put
glass inside a slightly different

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500
glass inside a slightly different
 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.520
glass inside a slightly different
substance like glycerin really thought

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530
substance like glycerin really thought
 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.110
substance like glycerin really thought
that was gonna ding then why is enough

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120
that was gonna ding then why is enough
 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.430
that was gonna ding then why is enough
there's another experiment to be done

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440
there's another experiment to be done
 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.619
there's another experiment to be done
there isn't now glycerin is really

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:54.629
there isn't now glycerin is really
 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.140
there isn't now glycerin is really
annoying and sticky but the interesting

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150
annoying and sticky but the interesting
 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.030
annoying and sticky but the interesting
thing about it is it has the same

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040
thing about it is it has the same
 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.180
thing about it is it has the same
refractive index as glass which means it

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190
refractive index as glass which means it
 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.059
refractive index as glass which means it
slows down light at the same speed the

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069
slows down light at the same speed the
 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.460
slows down light at the same speed the
glass does and makes it Bend in exactly

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470
glass does and makes it Bend in exactly
 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.020
glass does and makes it Bend in exactly
the same way well pretty much exactly

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030
the same way well pretty much exactly
 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.210
the same way well pretty much exactly
it's exact enough anyway that if I am to

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220
it's exact enough anyway that if I am to
 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.039
it's exact enough anyway that if I am to
put this glass stick inside of the

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049
put this glass stick inside of the
 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.150
put this glass stick inside of the
glycerin you can see that it does what

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160
glycerin you can see that it does what
 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.830
glycerin you can see that it does what
you can't see it I mean you can say if

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840
you can't see it I mean you can say if
 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.240
you can't see it I mean you can say if
you look if you'll meet and if you like

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250
you look if you'll meet and if you like
 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.559
you look if you'll meet and if you like
this and you're looking really closely

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569
this and you're looking really closely
 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.559
this and you're looking really closely
then you can vaguely see it but you

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569
then you can vaguely see it but you
 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:25.849
then you can vaguely see it but you
aren't gonna be able to say anything I

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859
aren't gonna be able to say anything I
 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:27.589
aren't gonna be able to say anything I
see I just explained it and I'm already

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599
see I just explained it and I'm already
 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.629
see I just explained it and I'm already
just like how the hell does that work

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639
just like how the hell does that work
 

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.759
just like how the hell does that work
that's refractive indexes for you okay

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769
that's refractive indexes for you okay
 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.460
that's refractive indexes for you okay
last experiments

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470
 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.110
so what I have here is some sand a

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120
so what I have here is some sand a
 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.539
so what I have here is some sand a
little metallic plate which is attached

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549
little metallic plate which is attached
 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.449
little metallic plate which is attached
to this machine which will create any

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459
to this machine which will create any
 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.030
to this machine which will create any
frequency I want it to so so pretty

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040
frequency I want it to so so pretty
 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.009
frequency I want it to so so pretty
annoying isn't it so what I need to do

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019
annoying isn't it so what I need to do
 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.780
annoying isn't it so what I need to do
is I need to just put a little

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790
is I need to just put a little
 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.770
is I need to just put a little
sprinkling of sand onto the plate season

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780
sprinkling of sand onto the plate season
 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.030
sprinkling of sand onto the plate season
the plates and then there are some

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040
the plates and then there are some
 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.460
the plates and then there are some
specific frequencies I can hit with this

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470
specific frequencies I can hit with this
 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.069
specific frequencies I can hit with this
that will make that send turn into a

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079
that will make that send turn into a
 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.750
that will make that send turn into a
lovely pattern which will let us

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760
lovely pattern which will let us
 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.479
lovely pattern which will let us
visualize sound I just have to find out

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489
visualize sound I just have to find out
 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.150
visualize sound I just have to find out
what those frequencies are Gideon is

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160
what those frequencies are Gideon is
 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.210
what those frequencies are Gideon is
well pissed off at me right now they can

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220
well pissed off at me right now they can
 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:21.770
well pissed off at me right now they can
need more sand heavily season looking at

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780
need more sand heavily season looking at
 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.409
need more sand heavily season looking at
one Oh someone's moving let's get some

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419
one Oh someone's moving let's get some
 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.790
one Oh someone's moving let's get some
more sand on there there's something

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800
more sand on there there's something
 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.640
more sand on there there's something
happening there quite as impressive as I

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650
happening there quite as impressive as I
 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:29.270
happening there quite as impressive as I
was hoping

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280
was hoping
 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.460
was hoping
god that is so annoying Oh oh my go

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470
god that is so annoying Oh oh my go
 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.460
god that is so annoying Oh oh my go
ahead did it look at that what are we

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470
ahead did it look at that what are we
 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.839
ahead did it look at that what are we
actually seeing here well this is the

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849
actually seeing here well this is the
 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.700
actually seeing here well this is the
sound that's coming out of the center is

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710
sound that's coming out of the center is
 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.190
sound that's coming out of the center is
causing this this shape is pattern so

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200
causing this this shape is pattern so
 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.290
causing this this shape is pattern so
the higher we go the more intricate

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300
the higher we go the more intricate
 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.240
the higher we go the more intricate
these patterns will get come on show me

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250
these patterns will get come on show me
 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.960
these patterns will get come on show me
show me this good stuff I believe oh
