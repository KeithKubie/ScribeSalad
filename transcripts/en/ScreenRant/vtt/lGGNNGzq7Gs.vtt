00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.530
In the world of movies, a budget can only
be stretched so far to create hulking green

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.850
monsters, realistic-looking spaceships, or
add an extra layer to crazy action sequences.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.789
That means film crews occasionally need to
cut corners hoping the viewers won't notice

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.060
– a plan that doesn’t always work out.
And some terrible effects are too big to miss.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.109
Here are Screen Rant's 10 special effects
fails in popular films.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.350
The Mummy Returns
Although the first movie in the series featured

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.800
the reverse-decay of a 3,000 year old mummy,
biblical plagues, and flesh-eating beetles,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.140
it's the film's sequel, The Mummy Returns,
that makes this list. The movie features large

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.850
CGI set pieces like a hundred-foot high tidal
wave and a massive jungle, but the graphics

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.980
weren’t as polished when it came to rendering
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson as the part-human,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.960
part-insect Scorpion King. The computer-generated
creature was criticized for looking more like

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.199
a video game character than a movie's villain,
especially considering the effects of the

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.629
movie that came before it.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.110
Star Trek Insurrection

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.330
The 1998 Star Trek movie relied on a mix of
practical sets, make up and computer generated

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.869
effects to create the alien planets and outer
space needed for its sci-fi storyline. But

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.240
the movie is best remembered for its shortcomings,
starting with its villains, who practice a

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.450
strange form of skin-stretching to keep looking
young. When the same machine is used against

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.380
a Starfleet officer’s will, the result is…
terrible. Besides not making any real sense,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.439
the face-stretching is so out of place and
ugly, the movie simply NOT showing him being

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.659
killed would have been a better idea.

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.820
Star Wars

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.700
Plenty of moviegoers took issue with George
Lucas’ use of green screen for the Star

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.759
Wars prequels, or tweaking scenes from his
original trilogy for no real reason. But one

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.470
scene sticks out in all re-released versions
of the first movie. In 1997, Lucas decided

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.340
that computer effects would finally let him
use a deleted scene where Han first crosses

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.610
paths with Jabba the Hutt. A CG Jabba was
painted in over the human actor, and things

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.439
only got worse from there. Whether you like
the scene or not, it’s obvious that technology

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.190
wasn’t where it needed to be to make the
CG Jabba match the original puppet. And when

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.250
Han had to be artificially raised and lowered
over Jabba’s tail, fans completely forgot

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.430
they were watching a billion-dollar property,
not an amateur computer class.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.480
King Kong

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.700
You would think that a movie capable of delivering
ONE amazing CG creation should be able to

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.230
keep that standard across the board. But Peter
Jackson’s King Kong wasn’t up to the task.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.250
The work done with actor Andy Serkis to bring
the giant gorilla to life was incredible,

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.819
but the dinosaur chase scene… wasn’t.
The first few shots of a brontosaurus stampede

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.340
can be forgiven, but as the sequence went
on – and on, and on – the effects went

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.379
from bad to worse. Mismatched effects that
know they’re bad are one thing, but the

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:53.330
movie seemed to have no idea how many eyes
would be rolling. And that can never be forgiven.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.190
Robocop

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.709
The modern reboot of RoboCop put its $100
million budget to good use, but the original

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.860
1987 film only had $13 million to work with.
Fans can be thankful that a good chunk of

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.019
that budget was spent on the practically-built
RoboCop suits alone, and relying on practical

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.890
effects to make officer Alex Murphy into a
crimestopping cyborg. But the final face off

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.190
between RoboCop and the movie’s corporate
villain turned to computers for an added punch,

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.290
sending him crashing through a window and
falling to his death. Apparently there wasn’t

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.959
time to take a second crack at the shot when
they realized the man’s limbs were completely

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.379
out of proportion with a normal human’s.
Considering the magic the crew pulled off

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.610
with practical effects, this laughable finale
sticks out like a sore thumb.

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.610
Blade II

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.810
Out of the three films in the Blade series,
Blade II became the most critically well-received

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.140
and financially successful of the trilogy,
though the sequel is far from perfect. Despite

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.860
his years of martial arts work, director Guillermo
del Toro thought a CG version of Wesley Snipes

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.360
would work best, taking a fight with two masked
vampires to even more superhuman levels. It

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.470
was an interesting idea, but once the real
swordplay was handed off to CG characters,

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.030
the sequence became one that fans would soon
want to forget, with effects that looked like

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.900
they belonged in a video game, not a movie
– in the worst way possible.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.120
The Fugitive

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.939
Harrison Ford starring role as Dr. Richard
Kimble helped guarantee that the story of

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:13.959
a man wrongfully accused of murdering his
wife would be a hit, with U.S. Marshall Sam

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.120
Gerard - played by Tommy Lee Jones – stacking
the odds even further. But when the men first

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.160
come face to face, Gerard leaves his target
with no choice but to leap to the uncertain

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.500
waters below. The movie managed to stage an
impressive train crash, but their dummy budget

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.300
was apparently scaled back as a result. We’re
not saying Ford, or even a stuntman, should

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.970
have made the jump, but maybe finding a dummy
with arms that actually bent would have been

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.100
a good place to start.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.570
Escape from L.A.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.160
After rescuing the President from the island-turned-prison
of Manhattan in Escape from New York, Snake

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.840
Plisskin returns in Escape from L.A. to save
the president's daughter from the island of

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.259
sin that Los Angeles has become. Unlike the
first film, Escape from L.A. had a relatively

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:56.040
massive budget of $50 million. But all that
cash couldn’t save the movie’s now-notorious

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.340
surf scene in which star Kurt Russell pretends
to ride a poorly realized tidal wave, while

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.900
actually acting against a green screen. It
may have helped the movie's campy sci-fi fun,

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.610
but the scene wasn't on the level that any
fan could have reasonably hoped for.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.000
Jaws 3-D

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.220
It was a very real shark puppet that led Steven
Spielberg to huge success with the first Jaws,

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.280
but by the third movie in the series, there
weren’t any reservations about using CGI

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.919
to render the great white shark in three dimensions.
Jaws 3-D probably planned to use the effect

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.470
to enhance the tension, and as a gimmick to
lure in audiences. But the result was at best,

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.550
cheesy, and at worst, possibly one of the
most ridiculous shots to ever make it into

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:43.150
a blockbuster hopeful. To make things worse,
the motionless shark and stunned actors were

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:50.520
highlighted in slow-motion, so audiences wouldn’t
miss a single terrible frame..

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.400
Star Wars: Attack of the Clones

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.729
One of the biggest complaints about the&nbsp;Star
Wars&nbsp;prequel trilogy is George Lucas' use

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.720
of CGI - favoring fake green screen over actual
sets of costumes. There are plenty of bad

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:07.970
effects to picks as a result,&nbsp;but the worst
in the prequel trilogy has to be the Republic's

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.639
clone troopers. Unlike the CGI aliens and
impossible sets in the other&nbsp;prequels, George

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:16.639
Lucas could have filmed actors in trooper
armor, but instead, not a single suit of the

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:21.530
stormtrooper-precursors was ever made. The
CG troopers were a perfect study in the uncanny

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.199
valley, looking and acting almost human, but
falling short, leaving audiences turned off

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.810
or taken out of the film completely. Since
some investment in their ranks was needed

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.789
for the emotional twists of the entire trilogy...
it was probably a bad call in the long run.

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:39.330
