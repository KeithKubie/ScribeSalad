00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.440
To get acquainted with R,
let's do some basic

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.850
calculations.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.560
We can add numbers, multiply
numbers, and we can invoke

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.510
built-in functions to do more
complex calculations.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.980
So R is good at calculations,
but we don't want to type in

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.810
all of our data.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.510
Instead, we'll often store
our data into R objects.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.070
In a later video, we'll load
in larger data objects, but

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.425
for now let's create some
simple R objects.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.620
Let's save the value 4 to
an object called x.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.970
Usually we use a less than
symbol followed by a dash to

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.060
communicate that we want to save
something like a number

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.370
into an R object.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.870
Now we can use x to do some
basic calculations.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.660
For example, x times x, or
we can calculate the

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.980
square root of x.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.040
Note that sometimes people might
call x a variable, so

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.260
think of the terms "object" and
"variable" as meaning the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:16.160
same thing in R. The names of R
objects can include letters,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.530
numbers, underscores,
and periods.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.480
However, the name should always
start with a letter,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.080
usually one that is lowercase.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.350
If you'll be sharing your code
with others, check with your

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.200
group to see if there's a style
guide that you should

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.450
follow for your R code.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.750
One last tip--

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.220
if you want to review an earlier
command you made,

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.870
click the command line on the R
console and then hit the up

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.060
arrow on your keyboard.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.640
When you do this, you will be
able to see earlier commands

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.000
you have run, and if you desire,
you can re-run them.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.910
In the next video, we'll create
and work with the

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.010
vectors in R.
