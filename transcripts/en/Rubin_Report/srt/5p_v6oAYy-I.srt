1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,330
[inaudible] joining me today is the man
that I have dubbed the Willy Wonka of

2
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:12,510
politics. It even says so on
the back of his book right here.

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,690
Michael Malice. Welcome back to the
Ruben report. Get to be back again. Dave,

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,910
we have a lot to do, my friend. Uh,

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,440
now most of it obviously is going to
have to deal with your choice of wardrobe

6
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,030
at general persona and being,
you've really done it this time.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,340
If I read this jacket,
pendant,

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,010
this is the actually the same
thing that Johnny Depp War,

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,130
but it's a w for him and that's an
m and now it's an m for Michael.

10
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:39,390
Although if you flipped it upside down,

11
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:43,500
it would be a w for William or
Willy Wonka. There you go. Uh,

12
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:46,780
that's actually the, the one that I didn't
see that one. It's not that either one.

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,290
What it is, it is the better one. Yeah.

14
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,960
So you're going to tell me the Charlie
and the chocolate factory with Johnny

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:54,780
Depp is better than Willy Wonka and
the chocolate factory with gene wilder.

16
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:57,230
And I'm not trying to be a contrarian
and I'm trying to block it.

17
00:00:57,231 --> 00:01:01,920
If it's much better. I haven't seen it,
but there's no way it's better. Well,

18
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,770
it's pretty good. I'm telling you
how could it possibly be better?

19
00:01:04,771 --> 00:01:07,380
You're telling me he was better.
He was better than gene wilder.

20
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:09,600
That's what you're telling me.
I'm in a position to make this call,

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,580
I suppose at some level because of the
great honor that I've bestowed upon you

22
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:17,250
by calling and either Willy
Wonka go out, but I just, I mean,

23
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:20,170
I just don't think anything could possibly
be better than gene wilder as Willy

24
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,080
Wonka.
Watch it and tweet out the answer.

25
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:27,900
This is a really disturbing start to
this thing. Okay, so let's do this.

26
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,591
So first off,

27
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:31,230
I'm going to do this interview completely
in a different way than I've ever done

28
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:33,960
before, which is that you may
notice I have no notes here.

29
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,890
Now my policy is that when it's a good
interview, I don't have to look down once,

30
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:40,140
but I thought,
you're so bananas.

31
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,070
Your political theories are so out there.

32
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,670
I thought I'm just going to sit down
and completely see what happens.

33
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:51,420
I am literally not going to write
down one thing beforehand. Uh,

34
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,910
so the reason that I call you
the Willy Wonka of politics,

35
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:58,540
he's not just because of your,
uh, high fashion style. Yeah. Uh,

36
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,590
but you actually do strike me
as a unique political thinker,

37
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,330
which is pretty freaking rare these days.
That's a huge compliment. Thank you.

38
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:14,740
That's all I have for you.
Okay. Good shot. Let's got
to know. All right. So, but,

39
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,510
but you really do. And even the way you
tweet, the way you use trolling, um,

40
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,830
you know, you're, you're out
there, political thoughts,
all of those things. I mean,

41
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:27,180
the way you present yourself, it's all
like just this really bizarre package.

42
00:02:27,181 --> 00:02:29,210
So for people that didn't
see our first interview,

43
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,810
just give me Michael Malice one o one.

44
00:02:30,811 --> 00:02:33,040
Let's just get the history
out of the way and then we'll,

45
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,510
then we'll go into the new right. And
the topics of the day, the Glib answer,

46
00:02:36,511 --> 00:02:39,600
he sees the ball. You hate to
love. Uh, the longer answer is,

47
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:43,230
my background is with North Korea
was my last book with your reader.

48
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:48,670
The New Right happen as a consequence of
so many of my friends who were in to a

49
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:52,640
trolls who are anarchists fell down
these rabbit holes of what they were,

50
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,590
what was called at the time and he
and reaction and later became like the

51
00:02:55,591 --> 00:03:00,130
outright and dark enlightenment.
So I watched the scene from build up from

52
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,060
the ground floor and then to have it
culminate to some extent in the Trump

53
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:06,820
presidency and contemporary cultural wars.

54
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,990
I had a bird's eye view so I knew
someone was going to have to write a book

55
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,690
about the subculture.
And I also knew that you know,

56
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:16,630
any reporter is not going to be able to
understand the scene cause at the very

57
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:18,520
least they're going to
be an outsider secondary,

58
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:20,470
they're going to have
their own prejudices.

59
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:24,310
So since my job had been to make North
Korea, you know, before I started,

60
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:25,150
when North Korea work,

61
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:29,020
the idea was they're crazy and crazy
means I don't understand you. It does.

62
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:30,860
It can mean, I don't understand
your can mean that your random,

63
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:33,220
but now everyone understands
North Korea is not crazy.

64
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:36,370
They have a very coherent logical
approach to their evil dictatorship.

65
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,760
And the same thing with this
scene. Everyone would like
to dismiss it. Jump ever.

66
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,970
Just loved everybody in. They're
all nuts. They're all Nazis.

67
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:46,900
And it'd be really convenient if you
could paint everyone with the same brush.

68
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,230
They'd be a lot less efficacious.
A, it'll be a lot easier to dismiss.

69
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:54,700
But that's not the way it is. And people
understand that any subculture, even the,

70
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,890
you know for the Republicans,
they think, oh the less the same,

71
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,800
the Hillary Clinton hate the Bernie
people, they really hate them.

72
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:03,400
So there's a lot of different
groups in what I call the new right.

73
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:06,890
And often though they're United in what
they regard as their oppositions possess

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,360
for progressivism between them,
they do not have much agreement.

75
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,280
Okay. So with that as the
backdrop to all of this,

76
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:18,840
and this also explains why when buzzfeed
and Huff Po and vox and the rest of

77
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:23,020
them are writing about you guys,
whatever that collective things here,

78
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,750
they always get it all sort
of wrong because as you
said, they're not part of it.

79
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:29,940
So they just look at the,
Oh, they must be racist.

80
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,750
Well, they also have an agenda. Yeah.

81
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,330
So racist means that which
is against progressivism.

82
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:36,700
And I have a list in the books of
things that have been called racist,

83
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:39,290
which includes moving into
minority neighborhoods and
moving out am I never did

84
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,250
in our neighborhoods.
Noticing races and not noticing races.

85
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:46,860
Milk a certain time of
dinosaurs. I mean picnics. Wait,

86
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,560
what type of dinosaurs? Racist. Uh,
there was the, in Jurassic Park,

87
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:52,860
one of the dinosaurs was called racist.
Uh,

88
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,580
I'm not sure exactly why I didn't follow
up meeting through the article. Yeah.

89
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,690
So I dunno. Um, and possibly a, um, um,

90
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,660
what's that? What's his name? Fred
Flintstones. Pet. Oh, Dino. Yeah,

91
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:09,010
he's a bit of a white supremacist. Just,
just [inaudible]. It's unfortunate. Um,

92
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,630
so I thought someone has to write
this book. And also it's a dark space.

93
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,910
So I wanted to have people be able to
explore it in an interesting way and in a

94
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:19,744
nonthreatening way.

95
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,230
Okay.

96
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,820
So for people that know nothing about
this and the couple groups that you just

97
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:27,700
mentioned, they are dark and light
and mint, the troll community,

98
00:05:27,701 --> 00:05:31,810
all of this stuff. Can you just kind of
break down all of it? How did this start?

99
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:34,690
How did you even start caring about it?
Were you part of it?

100
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,390
What the Hell is going on?
I was on, cause even for me,

101
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:39,760
and I have some basic
understanding of this stuff,

102
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,980
I'm actually not totally clear on all the
sort of markers and where everybody is

103
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:45,814
online and all that.

104
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:48,640
So it starts, I grounded in, uh,

105
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,970
1992 when Pat Buchanan who is
regarded as a paleo conservative,

106
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,720
we teamed up with Marie Rothbart who
was regarded as a Paleo Libertarian.

107
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,430
So between those two men,

108
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,360
you basically have everything that
is happening today within this scene.

109
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:06,590
Meaning nationalism, a
trolling, flirting with racism,

110
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,670
um, you know, contempt for authority,
skepticism toward the establishment.

111
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:15,440
The two of them had many disagreements
and at what point, you know,

112
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:18,770
Pat Buchanan and turned on Murray Rothbard
and later he asked Murray Rothbard's,

113
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,590
um, executor for
forgiveness, literally, um,

114
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,190
getting on his knees and
asked me for forgiveness. I
broke that news in the book.

115
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,790
And that has come down to contemporary
terms where the Internet with social

116
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:32,810
media allows, and this is both a positive
and a negative, is back in the day,

117
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:35,810
if you were that one person in your
town with these rude fringe views,

118
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:36,644
you're the freak.

119
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,520
But now that one person with their weird
fringe views in that town can talk to

120
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:43,880
the other person with the rouge printer
using the other town or in Denmark or in

121
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:47,060
Asia, or can put on a purple jacket
and show up at the Rubin report.

122
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,680
It's all very busy. They can't pull it
off. Um, uh, you have to earn this jacket.

123
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,340
So,

124
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,340
but now they have a community
and discussion and they
can develop an ideology.

125
00:06:57,681 --> 00:07:01,760
So what I saw happening as a result of
hanging out with the trolls is people

126
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:05,870
falling into this group called what was
called at the time near reaction or the

127
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:09,690
dark enlightenment. And it was things
like we need to return to monarchy. Uh,

128
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:14,330
America is this decadent Weimer Republic
that's on the verge of destruction and

129
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,850
where was this happening on the
Internet? So I'll need to know. I know,

130
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:17,690
but like where,

131
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,540
what do you mean w forums chat exactly
for him through all these blogs. You know,

132
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,500
it's very HP Lovecraft things you're
not supposed to know. It's especially,

133
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,010
it was, it was blogs, uh, not really
Twitter at the time and Facebook groups.

134
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:35,450
Those are the big ones back then.
So this would have been about like 2013,

135
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,910
2012. Okay. So now some of this
stuff starts bubbling up, right?

136
00:07:40,911 --> 00:07:45,911
And you start seeing these communities
that sort of don't really align but have

137
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,820
some weird touchpoints. And what do
you make of those touch and, well,

138
00:07:49,821 --> 00:07:53,720
what I knew from my, you know, I'm
a big pop culture person obviously,

139
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,910
and I knew how culture develops,

140
00:07:55,911 --> 00:08:00,800
which is it starts at the fringe with
the Weirdos and then the edgy people,

141
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:03,680
the cool people like, hey, have
you heard about this thing?

142
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,250
Then it becomes more mainstream and
then like kind of the nerds get it.

143
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:10,370
Then the corporations appropriated
and kind of tone it down, right?

144
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,520
So all of the intellectual momentum I
saw on the right was a result of this

145
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:19,640
stuff. These are the people talking
ideas, both nefariously and positively.

146
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,510
These are the ones asking the
big questions and basically
the radical questions.

147
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,060
And one of the big differences
between conservatives than you,

148
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:30,080
right is this conservatives take what
is given and this isn't a slight against

149
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:34,160
conservatives and regarded as all right,
basically what we have, how do we fix it?

150
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,590
Then you write often has
a more radical approach.

151
00:08:36,591 --> 00:08:39,650
Meaning just because something exists
doesn't mean it can't be destroyed

152
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:41,660
completely and started from scratch.

153
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:44,840
So these are two different approaches
and we see it regarding the press.

154
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:47,840
I got into an argument with Sean
Davis who writes for the federalists.

155
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,620
And his whole point is that, you
know, the media, they're all there.

156
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:54,380
They're all dumb. And my point is none
of these people are very, very bright.

157
00:08:54,381 --> 00:08:57,210
And if they're all making the same
mistake in the same exact way,

158
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:00,630
that is not a function as to petty stupid
people are all going to agree this is

159
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:04,470
a function of something more nefarious. So
that, so it's not a bug, it's a feature.

160
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,510
Correct.
Because they're,

161
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,580
they do have a certain specific agenda
and everyone has a certain specific

162
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:12,940
agenda. So this is a big
separation between conserves
and you're right, is this a,

163
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:17,210
uh, you know, part of society
salvageable or is it inherently, uh,

164
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,380
impure and,
and beyond redemption?

165
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,780
So when Trump was being elected ahead,
Eric Weinstein sitting in that seat,

166
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:25,670
and what I said to him was,

167
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,510
what most people seem to want
is a panther in a China shop.

168
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:31,370
We know something's wrong with the system,

169
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,780
but we don't want to blow up the system.

170
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:35,840
We want a panther to walk in there
and knock something off with its tail.

171
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,580
And Bang one thing off with the Ted,

172
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,380
but then closed the door
behind it and we'll, you know,

173
00:09:39,381 --> 00:09:41,300
a couple things we'll have broken,
but we'll be okay.

174
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,000
But there's no such metaphor as a,
a panther to try and copy.

175
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,000
It's a bull in a China shop,
but you just can't get it.

176
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,080
I sense that a lot of what you're talking
about is these people want the bull

177
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:54,600
in the chain. No, these people
want a bomb in a touch on the shop.

178
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,730
They want the China shop to be destroyed.

179
00:09:56,731 --> 00:10:01,731
And the phrase China shop is pretty apps
here because it's talking about foreign

180
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,520
influence in America and that's China's
not their big villain specifically.

181
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,550
But basically the idea like this
store needs to be torn down.

182
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,850
We're not breaking some dishes this we're
way past the point of breaking stuff,

183
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,590
but they want to blow up the
whole store to [inaudible].

184
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,910
It's not just about breaking
the China that's in the store.

185
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:20,660
They actually want the entire
structure and to change

186
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,970
and salted the earth. Yeah. To make
sure nothing can be built there again.

187
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:27,400
But so, so where, where
do you fall on that?

188
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,210
Because I sense there is this weird
thing of there's this weird thing on both

189
00:10:31,211 --> 00:10:31,841
the left and the right,

190
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:35,080
the left seems to really want to destroy
the whole thing too in a weird way.

191
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:35,680
But then you're,

192
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,170
you're talking about people on the new
right that want to destroy the whole

193
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,210
thing. They wanted to destroy
it for different reasons.

194
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,800
But what do you think the
left wants to destroy?

195
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:46,120
The left wants to destroy capitalism and
they want to destroy the basic way our

196
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:48,190
democracy has functioned
and things like that. Yeah.

197
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,450
Uh, I don't, I don't know that
they want to destroy capitalists.

198
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:55,010
And what should they think of it as
something that can milk and harness? Um,

199
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,050
Bernie, even Bernie, you
know, has said, you know,

200
00:10:57,051 --> 00:10:59,510
vaguely positive things to
say about capitalism, but,

201
00:10:59,511 --> 00:11:01,190
and I don't know that
they would ever admit.

202
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,880
Well, I think it's a slow,
it's a slow slope to get there.

203
00:11:03,881 --> 00:11:06,510
You don't just come out with day one
and say you want to destroy capitalism.

204
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,440
You just keep right.
But undermining it over election after.

205
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,430
I agree with you, but what I'm saying
is then you write is saying, yes,

206
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:15,520
we want to destroy this chapter for
this book is called the case against

207
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:16,210
democracy.

208
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,410
So in the scene there is a huge
question of how is it that democracy is

209
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:23,230
inherently good,
let alone inherently legitimate.

210
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:27,730
So lay out a case. Sure.
So the base, the, you know,

211
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:31,120
people say that communism works
in theory, not in practice, right?

212
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,160
Well that doesn't mean anything because
everything works in theory. You know,

213
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,360
theory means he practices how you
figure out something actually works.

214
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,060
Democracy is one of the few things
that doesn't even work in theory.

215
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,980
And here's why.
If you have with,

216
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:43,750
they talk about voter
turnout being a good thing,

217
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,410
well at what point does it become
legitimate? If 70% of people vote,

218
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,000
they can speak for the 30% who don't vote.
What if it's 40% vote in 60%?

219
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,490
Don't at what point it that you can say,

220
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:59,170
this group of the population can dominate
this other group, uh, who haven't voted.

221
00:11:59,171 --> 00:12:02,560
That's one example. But even
more technical terms, the purest,

222
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,980
I use an example from this book called
the Machiavellians, the purest, uh,

223
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:09,250
exemplar of democracies. The town
hall, you have a bunch of people,

224
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,820
everyone's there to kind of speak their
mind, put their point of view across.

225
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:16,060
Even in the town hall, you're going
to have to have limits on time.

226
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,030
You're gonna have an agenda,
what issues we're going to discuss.

227
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,570
So even in the most
democratic system a moment,

228
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,600
you're going to have an elite
setting the rules and boundaries.

229
00:12:25,601 --> 00:12:28,540
So one of the ideas behind the new
right is this theory of this old school

230
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,820
theory a hundred years ago called
the circulation. The elites,

231
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:34,780
meaning Hillary Clinton will always
have more in common with George W. Bush,

232
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:38,050
then she will have with the janitor,
and you can't get rid of an elite.

233
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:40,120
So much is replace it with another elite

234
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,920
[inaudible]. So this is a little bit of
the way game of Thrones ended, sort of.

235
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,240
I, I, I'm not, I'm not

236
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,240
right. Okay. Okay.

237
00:12:47,241 --> 00:12:49,640
There's a funny moment at the end where
they're trying to figure out how to rule

238
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:53,030
and in the future, and one of the
guys says, well, what about democracy?

239
00:12:53,031 --> 00:12:55,140
Let the people vote. And then there's
a moment where you're like, oh,

240
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,160
where are they going to end with
democracy? And then everyone laughs. Yeah.

241
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,620
Well isn't there was another new right
moment early on because didn't some

242
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,030
person hold up like a PCP,

243
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:05,390
a piece of paper that says you promised
them they basically ripped in left.

244
00:13:05,391 --> 00:13:05,870
Right?

245
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,050
So this idea that the constitution is
somehow going to start working and save us

246
00:13:09,051 --> 00:13:10,730
is another thing that
they're very skeptical of.

247
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,280
So what, what are you politically,
if you had to give yourself

248
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,070
I am label. Sure. I'm an
anarchist or that adjectives.

249
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,010
An anarchist without adjective. Yes,
sir. Explain the adjective part of me.

250
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,260
There's different schools of
anarchism. Yeah. Um, and I am more, uh,

251
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,410
there's an arco capitalism this and
[inaudible] and Arco. Communism.

252
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,360
I like it all. My point is essentially
is that government is not legitimate.

253
00:13:36,361 --> 00:13:40,050
It cannot be made legitimate. And you
have to start with that recognition. Now,

254
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:43,200
some people think, okay, if you take away
government, everyone's going to be equal.

255
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:45,270
You're going to have wage
equality. Some people think, okay,

256
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:47,550
it's going to be hyper capitalistic.
Sure.

257
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,210
I'm a lot more comfortable defending
anarchy than I am defending capitalism or

258
00:13:51,211 --> 00:13:52,110
communism or cynical.
Yeah.

259
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,983
Awesome.

260
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:58,180
So I think most people here
anarchist and they just think,

261
00:13:59,271 --> 00:14:02,630
well I mean I say this all the time,
it's just you want to end up in Mad Max.

262
00:14:02,631 --> 00:14:04,880
You just want sort of warring factions,

263
00:14:04,881 --> 00:14:09,881
constantly trying to take each other
out and that there is no sort of social

264
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:10,761
cohesion.

265
00:14:10,761 --> 00:14:15,110
There's no way to build big projects and
things like that because we don't have

266
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,380
something that sort of bringing us all
together that the government kind of

267
00:14:18,381 --> 00:14:20,330
sucky. I mean a lot of people
think this is kind of Sucky,

268
00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:21,230
but it's the best we got.

269
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:26,250
It's the best criticism [inaudible] are
actually descriptions of the status quo.

270
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,710
Meaning what you're
describing is the status quo.

271
00:14:28,711 --> 00:14:32,020
You have governments who are trying to
take each other out. China has, you know,

272
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,250
hacked our systems. Russia, you
know, is interfering in our election.

273
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:39,720
So other right now nations have a state
of anarchy with regard to each other to

274
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:41,200
some extent.
Um,

275
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,430
what Anik is and would do it provide more
security because you wouldn't have to

276
00:14:44,431 --> 00:14:45,810
have a government monopoly.
Uh,

277
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,920
the idea that you need the government
to kind of build a big project is really

278
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,740
not necessarily true.
Uh,

279
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:54,920
and if anything the government is probably
the biggest hindrance towards people

280
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:57,740
working together because they have to run
things through some bureaucrat who has

281
00:14:57,741 --> 00:14:58,670
no accountability.

282
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,700
Okay. But wait, want, I want to back
up before we go to down that road.

283
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:06,090
So just break down in a couple of these
other groups that were sort of in this

284
00:15:06,091 --> 00:15:07,230
trolling community.

285
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:10,230
And can you just explain like free for
someone of a certain age that really

286
00:15:10,231 --> 00:15:10,830
doesn't even under,

287
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:14,850
that's not on Twitter and then not on
four Chan or wherever the hell is going on

288
00:15:14,851 --> 00:15:19,050
or discord. Sure. Like what is
actually going on with the trolls?

289
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,470
Like what is the goal of the,

290
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,930
the older people actually
know trolling quite well.

291
00:15:22,931 --> 00:15:25,930
Cause the example I use in the book,
the first trial was Andy Kaufman.

292
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,740
So Andy Kaufman, right? He was the great
troll of all gray trial of all time.

293
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:33,910
He was on taxi as Laca,
which is not what he's proud of stuff.

294
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,660
And he would do things like,
he had this character called Tony Clifton,

295
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,260
who was basically, it's like old
lounge singer and a pink salmon blazer.

296
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,770
And he'd come down and sing terribly
and just be rate the audience. And,

297
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,460
and one most trolling moment is
he had this, he was performing,

298
00:15:48,461 --> 00:15:50,500
I think in Atlantic city. And
he says, oh, well, you know,

299
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:53,170
my wife died a few years ago.
And when I look at my daughter's eyes,

300
00:15:53,171 --> 00:15:54,700
I see my wife come on out here,
honey.

301
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,290
And she sits on his lap and they sing
and her voice cracks any slaps her across

302
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,230
the face.
And it goes with all you're doing,

303
00:16:01,231 --> 00:16:03,760
or I'm part of the audience is
booing. And he goes, oh, don't go.

304
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:06,580
You're just making her cry more.
Well, not only was in his daughter,

305
00:16:06,581 --> 00:16:08,110
it wasn't even a child who is an actress.

306
00:16:08,111 --> 00:16:11,650
So trolling correctly is forcing a party,

307
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:14,530
exploiting a party's weaknesses in
order to turn them into an unwitting

308
00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:17,170
performer. So other examples of
this, there was a little kid,

309
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:18,070
it's a little autistic kid,

310
00:16:18,071 --> 00:16:22,570
was on the late show in the UK or
Ireland and they asked him, Hey,

311
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,690
what do you want to do Huey Huey,
what do you want to do when you grow up?

312
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,370
And he goes, um, I want to fly planes
into buildings. And the guy goes, what?

313
00:16:30,371 --> 00:16:33,310
He goes, I want to fly planes, the
skyscrapers. And he's like, okay,

314
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:34,540
if you can't do that,
what would you want to do?

315
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:36,220
I'll move to Iraq and be a terrorist.

316
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:41,320
Now it's this little 10 year old boy and
the host now doesn't know what to do.

317
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:43,510
I think he's put on the
spot that is trolling.

318
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:47,710
Now trolling is often used on the internet
to be like being a jerk. That's not,

319
00:16:47,711 --> 00:16:49,090
to me a definition of trolling.

320
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,180
There's plenty of words for that and just
go into the cell and saying, you know,

321
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,830
you're this or you're that.
That's not clever. Trolling
is an art. So troll. Okay,

322
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:59,590
so how is it the Trump understood this?

323
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:02,560
Do you think that's because this is where
people say, well, he's just an idiot.

324
00:17:02,561 --> 00:17:03,230
He just says whatever.

325
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,830
Free lunch. There's no filter
that Tara, Tara, and it's like,

326
00:17:05,831 --> 00:17:09,550
if that really is the truth,
if that really is the truth,

327
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,290
then everyone else must be hyper
idiots. You know what I mean? I just

328
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,360
can't accept plausible truth,
which perhaps,

329
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,510
let me give a great example of Trump
trolling. Okay. Again, trolling,

330
00:17:18,511 --> 00:17:21,540
meaning you're forcing someone to
become a performer by exploiting their

331
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:22,230
weaknesses,

332
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,440
which it seems like now all the media
has become all with his enemies have

333
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:28,440
become the, he'd get them
to take any position on any,
here's the perfect example.

334
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:33,120
Yeah. For one year he's yelling at
Elizabeth Warren, take a DNA test,

335
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:36,090
take a DNA test, take a DNA
test. She takes it in secret,

336
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,190
doesn't even test for
native American blood.

337
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:43,020
It says she's at most 100024th
she releases it and she goes, Huh,

338
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,470
Mr President? I took the test and you
know what? He goes, who cares? Yeah.

339
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:51,750
So now she's made a fool of, he is not
at all engaging with her and she's left.

340
00:17:51,751 --> 00:17:55,590
You can even hear the curb, your
enthusiasm, music playing as she talks,

341
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,070
and this moment has become a broken woman
as a consequence of his clouding her

342
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:02,850
so thoroughly. What is it about him
that you think made him understand this?

343
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:07,851
How did this guy understand
this psychological trick
or whatever you want to

344
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:11,360
scenarios, right? Scott Adams,
who I know you've had on risk,

345
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,860
describes the Lucky Hitler phenomenon,
right?

346
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,640
That somehow it's just he always manages
to say that what he needs to to upset

347
00:18:17,641 --> 00:18:18,180
people.

348
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,690
The other scenario is like there's some
kind of rain man thing going on that he

349
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:23,010
just sees people's weaknesses.

350
00:18:23,011 --> 00:18:26,820
He knows exactly what to say and despite
him themselves, they lose their minds.

351
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,430
Another example of this was I
think it was pixelated, both.

352
00:18:29,431 --> 00:18:33,590
There's some Twitter account and they
made this fakes a screenshot from Michael

353
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,470
Wolfe's book fire and fury about
how Trump watches TV all the time.

354
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:40,830
And the staff at the White House made
something called the guerrilla channel.

355
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,190
And he talks to the gorillas on TV and
he says, oh, that goodwill is good.

356
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,800
And people are, and it was clearly
a joke. It was meant to be a joke.

357
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,950
People repeated this like,
oh my gosh, Trump is so dumb.

358
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,690
He talks to television like,
wait a minute,

359
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,400
you can think he's as dumb as you want.

360
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,550
You're telling me this man
who is 70 who's had a TV show,

361
00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:00,390
doesn't understand that you can't
talk to gorillas on a screen.

362
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,410
But that is the level that he's driven
them to. So it's hilarious to watch.

363
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,860
And it's beautiful from the [inaudible]
perspective because he's diligent

364
00:19:07,861 --> 00:19:10,830
organizing the political
process and the presidency.

365
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:15,270
So the reverence that people have for
the presidency has deadly consequences

366
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:17,310
because it allows them to get
away with things like war.

367
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:21,330
And if you think the guy in
the Oval Office is a clown
and that clown is getting

368
00:19:21,331 --> 00:19:25,440
ready to send your kids overseas to
possibly die or possibly kill people,

369
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,250
you're going to be a lot more
skeptical. God, there's a lock there.

370
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,930
So you think it's the whole book worth.

371
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,200
If only if only someone would write
a book about this sort of thing.

372
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:36,870
There's a lot there.
So you think in an odd way,

373
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:41,610
his behavior is
delegitimizing the presidency,

374
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:44,880
let's say the office of the presidency
or more broadly government in general.

375
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,290
And you ultimately view that as a good
thing because you don't think that really

376
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,420
has legitimate power to begin with.
Right.

377
00:19:51,421 --> 00:19:55,980
One of the big views of the Murray
Rothbard school is that the two political

378
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:58,440
parties are literally rival gangs.

379
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,340
And just like a gangster
has the nice rings and the
suits, they wear their suits,

380
00:20:02,341 --> 00:20:07,050
they go to the Senate. But these are at
base murderers who are plotting, you know,

381
00:20:07,051 --> 00:20:09,330
fighting with each other.
But it's in fighting. Um,

382
00:20:09,331 --> 00:20:13,590
so anytime the mask is dropped and you
realize these people aren't stealing your

383
00:20:13,591 --> 00:20:17,760
money, they're trying to control your
lives, they're causing massive, you know,

384
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:20,490
harm around the world often.
Uh, that's a good thing.

385
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:24,120
What's the ratio element that
comes out of all of this?

386
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:28,230
It's because for as much as I get a lot
of this and I like a lot of the trolling,

387
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,740
the good natured stuff
that's really getting the,

388
00:20:30,741 --> 00:20:34,010
the people that I don't like to flip
their lids. Like I love all that stuff.

389
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,440
And then there's this
other piece of it that,

390
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,750
that strikes me as it's hard to tell it
or they just intentionally inflammatory.

391
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,640
Do they really believe this?
What kind of power do these people have?

392
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:49,450
Are they coordinating all of that? Yes.
Jared Taylor is the head race realist,

393
00:20:49,451 --> 00:20:52,720
right? These are the people who you
racism as the most important issue,

394
00:20:52,721 --> 00:20:55,600
the outright, and I interviewed
him for the, for the book.

395
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:58,180
I went to his house and you know,

396
00:20:58,181 --> 00:21:01,150
even he was confused and
there's this great moment,

397
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:02,650
he's got this very weird accent.
He goes,

398
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,850
are you telling me these people
really believe this Hitler stuff?

399
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,560
Like he couldn't wrap it
and I go, yeah. And he goes,

400
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:13,800
the idea in this day and age that
Hitlerism would be a model for America is

401
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:19,150
simply fantastic. And I go, you
mean crazy, right? He goes, Oh yes,

402
00:21:19,151 --> 00:21:22,240
thank you for the clarification.
So even in that group though,

403
00:21:22,241 --> 00:21:25,310
they're the racists,
but he is your approach.

404
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,490
You then you have the people
who are full blown. Yes.

405
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,460
Well what does that mean?

406
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:33,350
So there are the racist meaning there are
just people who just full blown racism.

407
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,610
They just actually racist.

408
00:21:34,611 --> 00:21:37,670
They want people based on the color is
going to have different laws or not be in

409
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,420
this country.
You are

410
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,100
correct.
And they say if you're not,

411
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:44,240
if you don't see that as the most
important issue, you're blind.

412
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:48,050
So I, you know, had to engage
with that, writing this book.

413
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,120
Then they're the ones who
are, everything's about the
Jews, the Jews, the Jews, you,

414
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,300
I was, I was in Charlottesville.
I saw everything happening.

415
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,990
I couldn't go to all the events because
my contact was told don't bring the Jew

416
00:21:56,991 --> 00:22:01,940
to the party. I was not
wearing the blazer. Uh, but uh,

417
00:22:01,941 --> 00:22:06,941
so there is this whole subculture and
they disagree with themselves and it was

418
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:12,260
important for me to engage with them and
express what their point of view is and

419
00:22:12,261 --> 00:22:13,400
show how they're wrong.

420
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:17,120
Because what happens is when
you drive people to the margin,

421
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,610
it's like telling an,
especially when deal with young males,

422
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:23,690
it's like when you tell kids
if you smoke the principal,

423
00:22:23,691 --> 00:22:27,200
your parents and everyone's going to
get upset and then you can't get a pall

424
00:22:27,201 --> 00:22:29,420
mall fast enough.
So that the same thing here,

425
00:22:29,421 --> 00:22:33,590
it's like if you talk to these people and
say certain things people you hate are

426
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:35,810
gonna get upset, it's like, sign me up.

427
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,860
So the point I make in this book is you
take one red pill, not the whole bottle.

428
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,910
Because once they realized that the
corporate press is often dishonest and has

429
00:22:43,911 --> 00:22:46,130
an agenda,
they fall down this rabbit hole.

430
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:48,090
And unless someone grabs him
by the collar and said, yeah,

431
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:52,490
you don't have to go all the way,
uh, we, we can stop right here. Uh,

432
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,570
there are often lost.

433
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:54,360
So this is,

434
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,110
you would argue then the
reason why sensoring these
people in suspending people

435
00:22:58,111 --> 00:23:01,260
on Twitter and booting people off Facebook
and the rest of it is actually the

436
00:23:01,261 --> 00:23:04,560
worst possible thing that you could do.
I don't know if you become,

437
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,423
you just feeding it,

438
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,980
I don't know if it's the worst,

439
00:23:06,981 --> 00:23:11,950
but if they're going to say there is
an elite agenda designed to drive us

440
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,980
underground and keep the truth from
coming out, now they have evidence. Look,

441
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,850
we're being blocked. They don't want
to hear the truth. So that is a,

442
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,300
and the fact that David Duke,
for example, is still on Twitter,

443
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:27,170
is very curious to me. And again,
with the Internet and technology.

444
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,820
So, wait, what do you
think that's about then?

445
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,990
Well, I think David Duke is a
very useful foil for the left, uh,

446
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,280
because when he endorses people at Keith
Ellison or Johana Mar, it's crickets,

447
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,530
right? But when he says something positive
about somebody else, like, oh my God,

448
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,310
David do about Trump.
Yeah.

449
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:43,010
I don't think he likes Trump too much
cause Trump all Trump the kids married

450
00:23:43,011 --> 00:23:46,580
except for one marriage Jews.
So, you know, I, I it's, it's uh,

451
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,380
he's not that fond of the president. Uh,
everything's about Israel. David Duke. Um,

452
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,020
and I told him once on Twitter. So that
was a fun moment. You took out the Duke,

453
00:23:54,050 --> 00:23:57,200
like I don't know if I, I know I did.
He's still there and that's the problem.

454
00:23:57,201 --> 00:24:00,080
Like why is David Duke there while
people like Laura Loomer art?

455
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,100
I think that is very
odd, uh, um, a situation.

456
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,480
And you would say that really is just
because of the power dynamic within

457
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:10,480
Twitter or,
or within something bigger than,

458
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:14,410
I can't speak to why I'm not in the side.
Jack's mind Jack Dorsey's mind. Yeah.

459
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,920
I do think there's something here that's
not adding up and I think the more

460
00:24:17,921 --> 00:24:20,260
transparency the better.
Uh,

461
00:24:20,261 --> 00:24:22,480
and I think Jack and some level
would agree with that. Yeah.

462
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,600
What's your position on what to do
with the tech companies at this point?

463
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,210
Related to all of this in the
censorship and everything.

464
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,240
I think the solution is going to be just
like back in the day we had cupid and

465
00:24:33,671 --> 00:24:37,660
now you have Tinder and and, and all
these other sites and they separate out.

466
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,770
You're going, there's no reason everyone
has to be in one site. So the more,

467
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:46,780
if Twitter wants to say we're a site for
progressive ideas, they have that right?

468
00:24:46,781 --> 00:24:48,160
And,
and that's perfectly fine.

469
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:52,030
They're going to lose a huge market
share because when you drive out fringe

470
00:24:52,031 --> 00:24:54,010
ideas, whether evil, fringe,

471
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,900
you're also going to be driving
out the good fringe idea.

472
00:24:55,901 --> 00:24:57,040
That's where innovation happens.

473
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:00,310
So if you're going to have this
bourgeois middle of the road,

474
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,410
I don't want weirdness, uh, you're going
to lose the interesting people also.

475
00:25:05,411 --> 00:25:07,090
So this is a very big double edged.

476
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,200
So then why hasn't this
problem been fixed?

477
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:12,470
There's enough people frustrated
with it all over the political map.

478
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,940
Good old classical liberals are just
as frustrated as perhaps more nefarious

479
00:25:16,941 --> 00:25:18,920
characters and nobody has solved

480
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:22,180
this. But your frustration might be
a feature because they say, look,

481
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:26,030
we're obviously doing things right. We've
got Dave Ruben upset. So if there, uh,

482
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:30,580
if we live in a culture that's heavily
dominated by the progressive ideology,

483
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,940
so for them, if they are getting
certain people upset, they can say, hey,

484
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,990
we're doing our job.
Right.

485
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:38,230
The euphemism they currently use as
the quality of the conversation. Right.

486
00:25:38,231 --> 00:25:41,110
So yeah, I mean this is the
most Orwellian thing ever.

487
00:25:41,111 --> 00:25:44,720
Like you are going to be judging quality.
So it's, it's, it's a very, it's very,

488
00:25:44,721 --> 00:25:46,390
and which is a very different
thing from free speech,

489
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:51,430
which is messy and ugly and, and, and you
know, often reprehensible. [inaudible].

490
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,290
How do you think that the new
right then is supposed to,

491
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:59,220
I know you don't like boundaries and you
don't like gate keeping in any of those

492
00:25:59,221 --> 00:26:01,000
things,
but how do you think it anything,

493
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:04,430
I like gates. I'm a, I'm, I'm
not an inclusionist person.

494
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,730
I'm very much for freedom of association.
If I didn't want to talk to someone,

495
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,290
I'm not I black people liberally,

496
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,230
but how, but all right, so, but you know,

497
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:15,790
in a wider group outside of just
what's happening in your mind and your

498
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,380
interactions with people,

499
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,910
how do you think that this new sort of
group of people that are all over the map

500
00:26:21,911 --> 00:26:26,260
politically, right? Um, how do they,
how do they keep the fringe people,

501
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:29,110
the truly bad people out of the way?
This seems to be the biggest

502
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,410
yes. That nobody's solving. Uh, the Pr,

503
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,870
I don't think you can
because technology has made,

504
00:26:34,871 --> 00:26:38,170
it used to be you had three
networks, right? ABC, NBC, CBS,

505
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,440
and between the three of them, you
get the news. Then drudge came along.

506
00:26:41,441 --> 00:26:44,820
I talking about in the book and the
networks, like he's a lot legitimate.

507
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:46,020
He's not legitimate.
He's not legitimate.

508
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,870
He breaks one of the biggest
stories of all Todd Monica Lewinsky.

509
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,520
They didn't know what to do.
He still,

510
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,400
he's not legitimate and
illegitimate is like, he broke news.

511
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:55,440
Who are you to say he's now Jim.
And so this,

512
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,640
this orthodox idea of legitimacy has no
inherent meaning other than tribalism,

513
00:26:59,641 --> 00:27:02,790
right? So once you have technology and
thanks to Twitter, Facebook, whatever,

514
00:27:02,791 --> 00:27:06,030
everyone has their own Mike and there
are more and more mikes being built every

515
00:27:06,031 --> 00:27:06,810
day.

516
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:10,740
I don't see how you're going to be able
to put that genie back in the bottle so

517
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:15,290
you just have to let it be.
Then you'd say there's just no option.

518
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:20,390
It's just is correct and you have to
engage with bad ideas if you want to

519
00:27:20,731 --> 00:27:23,700
diffuse them because you're
not thanks to technology,

520
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,850
you're not going to be able to censor
anyone. Let me give you another example.

521
00:27:26,851 --> 00:27:29,940
I have this in the book.
Let's suppose this is like 1990 right?

522
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,330
And you're having an argument
censoring books and one guy's like,

523
00:27:33,331 --> 00:27:36,270
we need to censor books like mine. Calm
has bad consequences. Someone else like,

524
00:27:36,271 --> 00:27:37,440
no,
you need to hear free speech.

525
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:41,370
I come from 2019 teleport
back in time and I say, look,

526
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:45,930
someday you're going to be able to
copy a book infinitely at no cost.

527
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,190
You press one button,

528
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,190
you send it anywhere on earth
at the speed of light for free.

529
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,530
I would sound like a lunatic,
but that is the status quo. Oh,

530
00:27:52,531 --> 00:27:55,800
and also you could you say a magic word?
No, but orange and read it a password. Oh,

531
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:57,810
okay. Crazy person. That's the status quo.

532
00:27:57,930 --> 00:28:00,660
And technology is only going to increase
more and more and more to empower the

533
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:03,480
individual at the expense
of big conglomerates.

534
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:06,270
It becomes cheaper and cheaper to make
your voice heard. Back in the day.

535
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:09,180
You'd have to be like, if you don't like
it, make your own network. Well you did.

536
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:13,710
Yeah. Now, now it's going to be, I
mean, we're still using their pipes.

537
00:28:13,711 --> 00:28:17,640
I'm still dependent on, at least for
the moment on, correct. There's tech,

538
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:21,600
there's a great book called the goal
and the point of this book is what's the

539
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:24,120
goal there? Was to go for business
and he says to make money.

540
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:29,300
So how you do this is you look at the
pipeline from conception to production and

541
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,230
you look at what's
slowing up your profits.

542
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:32,970
So maybe you don't have
enough shipping boxes,

543
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:36,280
maybe you're not producing enough bottles,
maybe you have too much inventory.

544
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,500
So you gotta have more marketing.

545
00:28:37,501 --> 00:28:40,680
Maybe youtube is not sending your
videos out to your subscribers, right?

546
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:44,910
So you look at what the issue
is, the bottleneck, you fix that.

547
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:48,180
Once that's fixed, there's gonna be
another worst thing and you fix that.

548
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:53,010
So Twitter in many ways is a rear guard
movement right now because people are

549
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:55,780
realizing it's paypal
and it's the banks that,

550
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,900
and it's the fact that
there's domain registrars,

551
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,690
those are the next three that people
are going to build alternatives to.

552
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:03,330
Cause that's where the banks are
shutting down accounts right now.

553
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:04,800
And that's what's being underreported.

554
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:07,590
So Twitter is kind of a little bit of
a distraction because you'll always be

555
00:29:07,591 --> 00:29:11,370
able to make some rival to Twitter,
banking and paypal.

556
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:12,900
That's what's something
people have to look at now.

557
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:16,290
And do you think the right
people are looking at it, uh,

558
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:19,140
I think in your world or
are people looking at it?

559
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,910
I don't think this is
an ideological thing.

560
