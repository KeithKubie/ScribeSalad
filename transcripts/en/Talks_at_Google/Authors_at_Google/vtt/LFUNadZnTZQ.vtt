00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:04.729
&gt;&gt;Mike Oswall: Hello, my name's Mike Oswall.

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:08.200
I'm going to introduce my friend Rafe Sagarin.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:16.180
Rafe is a marine ecologist and an environmental
policy analyst at the University of Arizona.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.670
He was in my class at Stanford in 1994 and
he has a Ph.D. from UC Santa Barbara in marine

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.960
biology.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.289
And he's a Guggenheim fellow.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.560
He was previously at Google.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.510
In 2008 he gave a talk from his first book,
"Natural Security", which he co-edited with

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.350
Terry Taylor when they were both here.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.030
That was a very entertaining talk, so feel
free to go back and watch that later if you

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.030
like.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.790
Rafe is an avid runner.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.770
Yesterday, he was in Monterey and ran the
Monterey Marathon in 3 hours and 18 minutes.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.809
He lives in Tucson where he runs a lot in
the desert.

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.559
He lives with his wife, Rebecca, and their
two daughters Zella and Rosa, and their dog

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.559
Raina.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.500
They have a lovely house that's very desert-friendly.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.690
[laughter] He'll be speaking at the Commonwealth
Club this evening and we'll find out when

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.340
the broadcast of that will be as well.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.090
And without further ado, here's Rafe Sagarin.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.090
&gt;&gt;Rafe Sagarin: Cool.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.090
All right.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.770
Great to be back at Google.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.069
[pause]
Normally, I walk around a lot, but I'm kinda

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:24.710
stiff today, so I'm just going to hold on
to this pedestal for dear life.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.700
My email is up there.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.700
Often, some of the things I talk about take
a little while to kinda percolate through,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.210
and I get often emails from people a couple
days or couple weeks later, like, "Oh yeah,

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.100
wait, I was thinking about this that applies
to things."

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.400
Between the "Natural Security" book that I
did in 2008, which was sort of an academic

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.770
volume, and this book, a lot of what's gone
into this book are stories from people in

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.770
all kinds of fields, from business to soldiers
in Iraq and Afghanistan who have talked to

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.610
me about this adaptable process and then gotten
back to me with their stories.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.620
I really appreciate a lot of feedback, and
I really learn a lot in that mode.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.810
[pause]
The basic idea of what I'm talking about in

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.680
this book is: how can we learn from nature
about how to be more adaptable?

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.210
The way I see it, adaptation is really about
leaving your comfort zone or being forced

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.920
from your comfort zone.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.160
So if you think about these earliest amphibians
dealing with a sea full of predators, they

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.560
were both forced out of that comfort zone
that they were originally in, but they were

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:50.430
also drawn out by the opportunity that new
niches or new ways of living afforded them.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.760
As for me, my own adaptation into a marine
biologist who talks about national security

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.180
and other security issues really started when
I left my own comfort zone.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.400
My own comfort zone has always been tide pools
of the California coast.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.400
This is the Hopkins Marine Station, where
I did a lot of my work.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.930
It's right next to Monterey Bay Aquarium.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.200
My work has been on learning how natural systems
like tide pool organisms are responding to

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.220
climate change.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.290
But on 9/11 I found myself feeling very disconnected
because I was down in these tide pools.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.590
I had very close family who were in the capitol
building and other government buildings on

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.240
the morning of 9/11.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:41.320
And less than a year later, I found myself
very far outside my comfort zone, working

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.100
for Congresswoman Hilda Solis as a congressional
science advisor.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.100
Ms. Solis' issues -- you may know she's the
Labor Secretary now, but she was just starting

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.630
off as a Congresswoman back then in 2002 -- her
main issues are labor and environmental issues,

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:05.110
neither of which were going anywhere in that
particular Congress, which was very much like

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.240
our current Congress.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:14.970
That gave me a lot of time on my hands to
sort of look at the Washington D.C. ecosystem.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:21.330
As if I were a naturalist, 'cause that's what
I do in my day job: I look at these tide pools

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:27.660
and I try to figure out patterns in them and
really understand them from an observational

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.720
sense.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.420
That's really all I could do in D.C., so I
spent a lot of time looking at this ecosystem.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:41.500
What I discovered in this year wasn't hard
to see was what I call an "ecology of fear".

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.000
Everywhere in D.C. at the time you're seeing
New Jersey barriers popping up around, monuments

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.050
like fungus in a ring, and you're seeing new
metal detectors everywhere, and new guards

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.050
everywhere.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.320
But what disturbed me about it, which was
so unlike the tide pools that I'm so used

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.880
to studying, is that these things came up
and then they just didn't change.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.210
Every time I go to those tide pools in Monterey,
where I spent thousands of hours, they're

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.210
always different.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.070
They're always changing.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.770
That got me into this mode of thinking about
biological systems and how they always change

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.040
in response, say, to the defenses of their
prey, or to the new armaments of their predators.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.030
This is constant escalation and change.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:33.260
So I thought, "What else can we learn from
nature about how to deal with security threats?"

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.280
Right away, I came up against an impasse which
is actually one of the things I really like

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.780
about being a biologist, which is that my
biological expertise, such as it is, which

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:50.030
may be condensed to the tide pool life of
the central California coast, is such a tiny

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:56.520
sliver of the massive biological world that
I knew I needed a lot of help to really understand

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.640
biological adaptation.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.460
And if I understood very little of biological
adaptation, I obviously understood even less

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.639
about security.

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:12.490
What I did is I brought together these massively
interdisciplinary working groups at a place

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.240
called the National Center for Ecological
Analysis and Synthesis in Santa Barbara.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:24.340
It's an NSF funded think-tank, which usually
focuses on bringing people together to tackle

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:30.639
big scale environmental and ecological issues
like "What is the state of the world's fisheries?",

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.740
"How sustainable are timber harvests around
the world?", things like that.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.979
But they took a chance on funding my working
group, which simply said, "What can we learn

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:42.510
from nature about security in society?"

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:49.010
I brought together this wide range of life
scientists, anthropologists, biologists, evolutionary

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:57.850
biologists, psychologists, and as well I brought
together a very wide range of security experts,

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:04.740
which were practitioners, which were former
spies, which were public health officials,

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:08.470
and put them all together in a room simply
seated with this question about what we can

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.160
learn from nature.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:16.970
The discussions just took off from there and
became these very exciting discussions where

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:23.820
we touched on just about everything that there
is to look at at the inner face of security

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.310
and biological life.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:32.320
What surprised me after a while of doing this
is that I thought we'd be completely overwhelmed

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:40.000
with the diversity of life, but in fact, we
started to converge on a few fairly simple

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.729
rules of nature, rules of adaptable systems,
that I felt we could start to translate into

00:07:45.729 --> 00:07:48.070
things we could apply in society.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:53.330
I'll go through those high level ideas, and
then we'll drill down into the specifics of

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.610
adaptable systems.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:01.350
The basic problem as we see it, the basic
opportunity as we see it, is that nature faces

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:08.590
the exact same problems that all of us do,
which is that risk is completely ubiquitous.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.380
It's almost entirely unpredictable.

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.380
All natural organisms have to deal with that,
just like we have to deal with that.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:20.410
The difference being that nature has dealt
with it for 3 and 1/2 billion years, and it's

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:26.210
been surviving and thriving across that whole
range of biological evolution on Earth.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:29.110
I'll break that down a little more.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:33.490
We say that the world is full of unpredictable
risk, but a fish doesn't try to turn a shark

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.620
into a vegetarian.

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:40.009
By that, I mean the fish will do everything
in its power to avoid getting eaten by that

00:08:40.009 --> 00:08:47.779
shark, but it doesn't implicitly understand
that it can get rid of the threat of predation.

00:08:47.779 --> 00:08:54.869
We spend a lot of time in society trying to
assure ourselves, and spend a lot of resources

00:08:54.869 --> 00:08:58.550
assuming that we can eliminate risk in our
world.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:01.179
We declare a war on terror.

00:09:01.179 --> 00:09:03.660
We declare a war on drugs.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:09.330
In my own field, we declare a war on invasive
species, as if we could ever sort of fully

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:15.069
take care of these problems which are actually
just generalized risks rather than specific

00:09:15.069 --> 00:09:16.389
things we can do.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:20.509
The organisms, folks, focus on the specifics,
not on the generalities.

00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:24.720
I'll get into that a little more.

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:30.170
Another set of high level ideas from nature
is that nature doesn't plan.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:31.759
It doesn't predict.

00:09:31.759 --> 00:09:34.319
It doesn't try to be perfect.

00:09:34.319 --> 00:09:40.680
What nature does is it adapts to solve problems
in its environment, whatever form it takes.

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.920
I'll break that down a little bit.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:50.329
My exhibit A on this point is this very strange-looking
fish called the mola mola, or the ocean sunfish.

00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:53.510
If you go down to the Monterey Bay Aquarium,
you can see them.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.839
You have to see them to believe that they're
real.

00:09:56.839 --> 00:10:00.759
It's the most bizarre looking fish, but if
I asked any of you to plan a fish for me,

00:10:00.759 --> 00:10:05.459
give me a plan for a fish, you would never
come up with a fish that looks like this.

00:10:05.459 --> 00:10:08.129
And yet, this has been one of the most successful
fishes on Earth.

00:10:08.129 --> 00:10:09.360
It's lived for millions of years.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:14.540
It's the largest bony fish, because it's exploited
a niche that was available to it.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:19.170
It solved problems in its environment and
continues to do so.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:25.399
Likewise, we spend a lot of time and a lot
of resources doing predictive modeling.

00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:30.149
Trying to fool ourselves into this sense that
we can predict the future, and then we'll

00:10:30.149 --> 00:10:31.819
be better prepared for it.

00:10:31.819 --> 00:10:33.880
But nature doesn't do that at all.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:39.410
Natural selection has weeded out any waste
of resources, trying to predict a completely

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:40.910
unpredictable future.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:47.850
And as for perfection, we often hear about
the perfection of nature.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:52.730
If you watch Discovery Channel during shark
week, they'll say, "Here's the Great White

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:55.410
Shark, nature's perfect predator!"

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:56.459
And I always say, "You know what?

00:10:56.459 --> 00:11:00.510
It'd be a lot more perfect if it had laser
beam eyes, but it doesn't."

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:04.119
There's no way to actually measure perfection
in nature.

00:11:04.119 --> 00:11:10.310
All natural organisms have to be good enough
to survive and reproduce themselves, so it's

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:15.230
survival of the good enough, not really survival
of the fittest.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:20.089
[pause]
So here's the thing: okay, they do all this

00:11:20.089 --> 00:11:22.019
by being adaptable.

00:11:22.019 --> 00:11:26.110
They live without planning, without prediction,
without trying to be perfect, just by being

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:29.309
adaptable, and everyone's talking about being
adaptable now.

00:11:29.309 --> 00:11:34.820
We always hear, "Oh, that company should have
been more adaptable to changes", "That organization

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:38.749
should have been more adaptable", "This government
agency needs to be more adaptable."

00:11:38.749 --> 00:11:43.230
But people don't really understand at the
fundamental level what it means to be adaptable

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:45.389
or how you actually do it.

00:11:45.389 --> 00:11:50.929
It just becomes a corporate buzzword: adaptability,
yay.

00:11:50.929 --> 00:11:55.889
What I'm trying to do here is break down that
natural adaptability into component parts

00:11:55.889 --> 00:12:01.779
that you can then apply into whatever realm
you're in where you have to deal with risk

00:12:01.779 --> 00:12:03.310
and unpredictability.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:07.410
[pause]
The first rule of adaptable systems that comes

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:10.019
to us from this remarkable guy, Geerat Vermeij.

00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:12.129
He was one of my working group members.

00:12:12.129 --> 00:12:14.199
He's a paleobiologist at UC Davis.

00:12:14.199 --> 00:12:16.339
He's one of these amazing naturalists.

00:12:16.339 --> 00:12:20.939
He can identify any species.

00:12:20.939 --> 00:12:27.259
He is even more amazing because he's been
blind since he was 3 years old.

00:12:27.259 --> 00:12:35.089
He picks up a fossil and he can tell you everything
about what it is, how it lived, how it died.

00:12:35.089 --> 00:12:41.239
Through this incredible observational sense
and a very broad mind as to thinking about

00:12:41.239 --> 00:12:50.459
how trends in biological history have worked,
he has concluded that the most adaptable species

00:12:50.459 --> 00:12:54.110
are those that are fairly decentralized.

00:12:54.110 --> 00:13:03.079
They allow a number of independent parts to
sense and respond to the environment.

00:13:03.079 --> 00:13:06.871
That's one of the reasons the octopus is the
central metaphor in this book because octopuses

00:13:06.871 --> 00:13:09.370
are a great example of this.

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:12.019
Octopuses have a wonderful central brain.

00:13:12.019 --> 00:13:13.420
They're very intelligent.

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.019
They're cognitive.

00:13:15.019 --> 00:13:16.160
They think about things.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:19.420
They can actually think in advance about things.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:24.929
They probably have a sense of self, which
is very rare in non-human organisms.

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:29.929
Nonetheless, if they're swimming over a coral
reef, they don't have that wonderful central

00:13:29.929 --> 00:13:36.850
brain say, "Okay, arm one turn blue now and
arm two turn kinda purple and arm three turn

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:38.269
kinda pinkish."

00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:44.639
What they have is millions of skin cells spread
out over their body, each individually responding

00:13:44.639 --> 00:13:47.420
to changes in their environment.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:52.230
By doing so, they give the octopus as a whole,
this sense of camouflage.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:57.230
This is not unlike our immune system, which
is a bunch of cells running around our body,

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:01.759
looking for invaders and responding to them
without any back and forth to our central

00:14:01.759 --> 00:14:02.829
brain.

00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:10.240
This decentralized mode in nature is very
common, and it gives you a way to adapt to

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.269
changes very quickly.

00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:16.639
Now in society, we tend to do almost the opposite
when we're threatened.

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:20.940
After 9/11, the first thing we did was create
the Department of Homeland Security which

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.929
is almost the opposite organization.

00:14:22.929 --> 00:14:28.949
It's a top down, stacked up organization where
everything has to run up and down this org

00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:31.139
chart to get anything done.

00:14:31.139 --> 00:14:36.519
We certainly saw this problem in the first
major security test after 9/11, which was

00:14:36.519 --> 00:14:37.829
Hurricane Katrina.

00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:40.800
The thing was, there everyone's asking, "Where's
FEMA?

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.800
What's going on?

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.540
FEMA should be here responding and we're not
getting a response."

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:45.790
Well, where's FEMA?

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:47.209
Look at the org chart.

00:14:47.209 --> 00:14:50.279
It's down there, buried in this stack of boxes.

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:52.240
These boxes are not trivial little things.

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.410
One whole box in this chart is the Coast Guard.

00:14:55.410 --> 00:15:00.610
So it's buried in there, nonresponsive.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:06.540
Another related idea from adaptable systems
in nature is that nature uses redundancy to

00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.939
solve many types of problems.

00:15:08.939 --> 00:15:15.079
In society, we tend to think of redundancy
as wasteful or as inefficient, but it's everywhere

00:15:15.079 --> 00:15:16.609
in nature.

00:15:16.609 --> 00:15:20.449
Over 3 and 1/2 billion years have to tell
you that there's not going to be a lot of

00:15:20.449 --> 00:15:22.049
waste and inefficiency in nature.

00:15:22.049 --> 00:15:25.249
It doesn't have abundant resources to throw
at a problem.

00:15:25.249 --> 00:15:29.040
And nonetheless, redundancy survives again
and again.

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:34.119
There's simple redundancy in nature, which
like this centipede, has multiple walking

00:15:34.119 --> 00:15:36.319
legs all doing the same thing.

00:15:36.319 --> 00:15:38.209
That's fine, that gets you somewhere.

00:15:38.209 --> 00:15:39.829
Centipedes are fine organisms.

00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:41.290
They've survived.

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:46.439
They haven't really diversified that much,
but when some lines of these arthropods became

00:15:46.439 --> 00:15:49.239
beetles, they massively diversified.

00:15:49.239 --> 00:15:53.970
So much so that about 100 years ago when the
biologist J.B.S.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:59.290
Haldane was asked, "What do all your studies
of nature tell you about the Creator?" and

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:04.169
he said, "Well, he must have an inordinate
fondness for beetles."

00:16:04.169 --> 00:16:06.089
Beetles are everywhere.

00:16:06.089 --> 00:16:10.810
They've been incredibly successful because
they turn that redundancy into again what

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:16.929
Geerat Vermeij calls a "creative redundancy"
where individual parts are specialized into

00:16:16.929 --> 00:16:22.370
wings for solving problems, into claws and
devices for shooting chemical weapons and

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:23.869
walking legs.

00:16:23.869 --> 00:16:29.730
You get this combination in adaptable systems
of multiple ways of seeing a problem with

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:37.470
those independent eyes and independent skin
cells and independent immune cells, and multiple

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:39.629
ways of solving those problems.

00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:46.259
That gives you a lot of ways to respond to
unpredictable threats.

00:16:46.259 --> 00:16:50.410
[pause]
Here's a shout out to you guys.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:57.679
A good example of how this would work in society
is Google Flu Trends.

00:16:57.679 --> 00:17:03.189
Google Flu Trends maps out when we're all
searching flu-related terms like "Does my

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:07.020
kid have flu?", "What are flu remedies?" all
that.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:11.910
What you see in this paper that was published
in "Nature" on it is that it tracks extremely

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:19.140
closely to the Center for Disease Control's
flu trends data, with one major difference.

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:25.850
The CDC, big, top down centralized organization,
sends out surveys to doctors and hospitals,

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:31.830
gets them back to Atlanta, has statisticians
crunch through them, and publishes a report,

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:35.930
on average about two weeks later than you
can get virtually the same data from Google

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:41.540
Flu Trends, which is just using those independent
sensors out there: all of us searching on

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.540
Google.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:46.900
Two weeks when you're talking about a potential
flu epidemic is a massive advantage.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:52.750
It just shows a contrast between that centralized
approach to seeing how the world's changing

00:17:52.750 --> 00:17:58.990
to that decentralized approach.

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:06.870
The next major thing is that all adaptable
organisms run up to their limits of adaptability.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:12.890
When they run up to their limits of adaptability,
they have to reach out to other organisms

00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:14.710
to extend what they can do.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.750
This is called symbiosis.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:22.910
It's various types of partnerships that all
organisms make with other organisms to extend

00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:23.960
their adaptability.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.830
Symbiosis is everywhere in nature.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:31.030
It occurs between the most unlikely of organisms.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:36.160
For example, this little cleaner wrasse is
swimming into the mouth of a large predatory

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.370
grouper to clean out its teeth from parasites.

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:47.860
Symbiosis also creates what we call emergent
properties: things you wouldn't expect from

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.530
this immediate interaction.

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:54.440
It's been shown that these large predatory
fish are actually much less aggressive to

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:59.050
all the fish on the reef patch when they're
set up in these cleaning stations that the

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:03.270
little wrasse has made.

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:09.790
Oftentimes, throughout biological history,
long term symbiotic partnerships have emerged

00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:14.470
out of relationships that were conflictual.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:19.370
You have this pattern of conflict leading
to cooperation.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:21.360
We tend to do the opposite.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:24.860
We tend to put up walls between our conflicts.

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:28.160
This is the border wall near my home in Tucson.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.010
This is down in Nogales.

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:38.150
But I have seen human symbiotic partnerships
that can blow right through these walls.

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:45.490
An example comes from my partner in this research,
Terry Taylor, who's shown up top here.

00:19:45.490 --> 00:19:51.100
Terry Taylor has helped to facilitate partnerships,
symbiotic partnerships.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:57.120
In this case, between Israeli, Palestinian
and Jordanian doctors and health ministers

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:03.250
who are all working together to identify and
neutralize emerging infectious diseases no

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:09.250
matter what side of the border wall or the
disputed territories that they arise on.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:14.970
These partnerships show some of the same characteristics
of natural adaptable systems.

00:20:14.970 --> 00:20:21.140
Most notably, these guys are not in this to
create peace in the Middle East.

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.220
They're not trying to create a perfect solution.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:27.720
They're looking at the immediate problem and
trying to solve that problem.

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.920
That's brought together the energy behind
this symbiotic partnership.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:36.990
[pause]
Also, Terry has had such success with this

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:43.610
group that he's then replicated these partnerships
in the six countries around the Mekong River,

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:48.250
which are no less friendly towards one another
politically, and now in countries in southern

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:49.270
Africa.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:58.200
That leads to another system rule of adaptable
systems, which is that the most adaptable

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.140
organisms learn from success.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:07.450
We're hearing a lot of buzz these days in
management literature and organizational literature

00:21:07.450 --> 00:21:11.760
about how important it is to learn from failure,
and isn't it great to learn from failure,

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.860
and it sounds very self-effacing and clever.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.010
In fact, learning from failure is an evolutionary
dead-end.

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.060
It means you die.

00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.270
It means you don't reproduce.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:28.860
Learning from success is that seed that creates
a creative, recursive feedback cycle that

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:32.280
leads to all the development of evolutionary
systems.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:37.360
It leads to continual adaptation built off
a past success.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.180
It's important enough to learn from failure.

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:44.770
You don't want to repeat the same stupid failures
again and again, but we focus way too much

00:21:44.770 --> 00:21:45.980
on learning from failure.

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:50.890
For example, in the Townsend after action
report, the government's report on what went

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:58.100
wrong with Hurricane Katrina, there were over
100 different failures identified.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:59.100
That's important.

00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.750
You want to recognize "Here's what we did
wrong.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:02.370
Let's not do this again."

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:08.840
But the most important success of the Hurricane
Katrina response was completely ignored.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.420
We didn't look at what went right.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:16.390
That success was the Coast Guard cleaning
up a 9 million gallon oil spill.

00:22:16.390 --> 00:22:22.760
When would it be useful to have information
about how to clean up oil in difficult circumstances

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.460
in the Gulf of Mexico?

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:29.850
Well, in the very next Gulf of Mexico disaster,
which was the Deepwater Horizon.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:34.460
Because we had focused so much on failure
and trying to learn from failure, we had lost

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:39.290
an opportunity to learn from success in a
way that may have been useful during Deepwater

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.440
Horizon.

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:48.140
Taking these ideas together, you can use them
as a spotlight to analyze past situations,

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:53.860
or you can use them as a map to look for it:
how can we become more adaptable going forward?

00:22:53.860 --> 00:23:00.580
I'll take a security example as an example:
the spotlight approach.

00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:07.400
This is the unfortunate case of improvised
explosive devices killing soldiers in Iraq

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:08.490
and Afghanistan.

00:23:08.490 --> 00:23:17.080
What I show in these charts is the monthly
real deaths of US combat soldiers due to IEDs.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:22.580
In Iraq shown in red and Afghanistan shown
in green.

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:27.130
Here's a case where the Department of Defense,
this big centralized organization, went into

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:31.900
Iraq with a plan, with a lot of predictions
about what it was going to look like.

00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:36.690
But it was these grunt soldiers on the ground,
essentially your independent eyes looking

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:42.210
at change and seeing what's going on, who
immediately recognized that the war they were

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:47.790
facing was nothing to do with the plans, nothing
to do with the predictions, but that these

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:55.090
unexpected IEDs, improvised explosive devices,
were going to be the biggest threat to them.

00:23:55.090 --> 00:24:01.110
So much so that very early in the war, this
young specialist from the Tennessee National

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:07.540
Guard, Thomas Wilson, whose picture is shown
up there, had the audacity to confront Secretary

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:11.380
Donald Rumsfeld at a big press conference
and said, "You know what?

00:24:11.380 --> 00:24:15.800
We're going around, we're strapping hillbilly
armor onto our vehicles", which was scrap

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.800
metal.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:20.580
In other words, these soldiers adapting as
best they could because the vehicles they

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:22.520
had weren't going to do it.

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:27.090
And Rumsfeld tartly retorted, "Well, you go
to war with the army you have" which is a

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.820
very nonadaptable statement.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:34.160
Nonetheless, Congress got word of this, got
very upset, said "We've got to provide armor

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:40.010
for our troops out there, so crank up the
DOD procurement machine."

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:46.400
And in what DOD considered a very fast deployment,
three years later these heavily armored vehicles

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:51.760
known as MRAPVs, mine resistant ambush protected
vehicles, were sent out in the country.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:25:00.640
Over those three years, over 1300 US soldiers
died due to IEDs in Iraq.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.200
In the intervening time, soldiers weren't
just sitting there getting themselves killed.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.110
They were doing all sorts of things to try
to adapt.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:14.150
But it turned out that the most important
thing they did was create symbiotic partnerships

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.200
with the enemy.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.730
There were people that were previously shooting
at them, people that were previously making

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:24.770
bombs and putting them out, and soldiers on
the ground and their commanders figured out,

00:25:24.770 --> 00:25:27.730
"What do these people really need?

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:32.930
If we can exchange that for a little bit of
peace in our realm and a little bit of information,

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:34.070
we could go a long way."

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:41.100
What you see pointed out here is actually
underneath this curve is more and more intel

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:46.160
from local populations going to soldiers on
where the bombs are.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:51.200
That peaks right around this time, and right
after that, the IED deaths just plummet well

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.750
before these up-armored vehicles came into
the country.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:26:01.220
Now we've got these huge up-armored vehicles
that we've made thousands of and luckily enough

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:07.080
for the DOD, things are heating up in Afghanistan
again, so let's send those vehicles over there.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:12.610
Well, a 15-25 ton vehicle can go almost nowhere
in Afghanistan.

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:17.100
It had some mobility in Iraq, but there's
very few roads that can handle these vehicles

00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.330
in Afghanistan.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:24.390
If you're in the Taliban and you've got a
1 ton Toyota pickup truck, probably the most

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:31.110
adaptable vehicle ever made, you can go anywhere
at will and you also know exactly where the

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:35.720
US forces are going because they are limited
to certain routes.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:41.500
And Taliban then start using the IED approach
and being unfortunately quite successful,

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:48.750
learning from their successes, and getting
more and more successful killing with IEDs.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:52.980
Now for thinking about taking these ideas,
moving forward, one stumbling block for a

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:59.780
lot of people is this idea that we're totally
different from the rest of the natural world.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:05.750
I continually try to point out the fact that
yes, we are different, we have a wonderful

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:10.800
cognitive mind that's better than any other
organism, and we're extremely social and that

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:16.420
has given us a lot of power to adapt, and
that's been really good, but we're not that

00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:17.910
different in the end.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:22.920
We have the same genetic architecture and
we do the same fundamental things.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:28.180
For example, one of the things that we do
that all living organisms do since the beginning

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:34.750
of biological time is organisms have to identify
what is like themselves and what's not like

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:35.750
themselves.

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:38.720
It's called self-nonself recognition.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:43.141
It takes on all kinds of different forms,
whether you're a bacteria or a salmon, for

00:27:43.141 --> 00:27:48.221
which it takes on the form of having a really
good chemical sense of your home stream, so

00:27:48.221 --> 00:27:53.170
much so that you will battle your way past
anything to get back to that home stream to

00:27:53.170 --> 00:28:00.260
reproduce and then die: essentially a suicide
mission to send your genes onward.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:02.990
Based on this self-nonself recognition system.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:04.950
Now in humans, it's much more complex.

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.610
It's behaviorally mediated, but it's the same
thing.

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:14.410
It's the same reason why we develop such strong
group identities, identities that are so strong

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:20.190
that in extreme cases, we'll kill ourselves
for a cause if we believe it will benefit

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:22.720
our group.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:28.280
Evolution goes beyond, in humans, just the
simple "replicating my own genes", but it's

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.440
also mediated in group dynamics.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:36.810
All that is to say that we are this evolutionary
species.

00:28:36.810 --> 00:28:41.860
We've actually been an incredibly adaptable
species for most of our existence on Earth.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:47.880
And yet we've buffered ourselves almost through
our successes from the relentless push of

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:48.880
evolution.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:53.200
The question is: how can we start becoming
adaptable again?

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:58.010
Taking these systems we have, that have become
somewhat unresponsive, and making them much

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:01.040
more adaptable and responsive again.

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.840
I never say anywhere in this book or anywhere
I talk about like, "Yeah, we've just got to

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:10.390
tear down the Department of Homeland Security"
or "Tear down the Department of Defense and

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:15.070
build them up as this adaptable organization"
because I'm not into perfect solutions.

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:17.090
Nature isn't into perfect solutions.

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:22.480
What you want to do is identify problems within
those organizations, within your own organization,

00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:28.100
within your own lives, and figure out: how
can I solve that problem more adaptively?

00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:34.140
The main shift that needs to happen is to
shift from a mode of giving orders to issuing

00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:36.070
challenges.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:41.040
Giving orders is when a small group of experts
or a single leader, single organization says,

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:43.230
"This is what you all need to do.

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:45.240
Follow me."

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:49.110
Issuing challenges is when you say, "Here's
a problem we're all facing.

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:52.940
Who among you can help us solve this problem?"

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:56.450
An early precedent for this is in the 17th
century.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:30:00.360
Ships were crashing all over the place because
no one knew their longitude at sea.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:04.290
It was a huge problem.

00:30:04.290 --> 00:30:09.240
Everyone thought, "Oh, our great astronomers
will figure out how to navigate using astronomy

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.540
so that we'll figure out our longitude."

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:15.550
But rather than relying on that, English Parliament
issued a challenge.

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:22.050
They said, "Anyone who can solve this longitude
problem: we'll give you a big prize."

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:26.080
It turned out it wasn't an astronomer, but
a watchmaker who figured out if they could

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:31.890
make a very accurate chronometer that could
keep time very accurately at sea relative

00:30:31.890 --> 00:30:35.559
to the home port, you could calculate your
longitude.

00:30:35.559 --> 00:30:38.050
That's what solved the problem there.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:43.320
[pause]
The thing about challenges is they're not

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.790
just if they're done right.

00:30:45.790 --> 00:30:50.020
They're not just a one-time thing that gives
you some good solutions to a problem.

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:57.880
They can be set up to be a perpetual adaptive
machine or what I call an "adaptive cascade"

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:04.880
that goes from activating these independent
sensors, which is what happens when you issue

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:10.050
a challenge broadly and a whole bunch of people
are trying to respond to this problem.

00:31:10.050 --> 00:31:15.330
And that gives you these multiple creative
redundancies that you want.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:20.090
So you get a lot of different solutions coming
from all over the place, not just the astronomers

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:23.190
but the watchmakers out there.

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:26.860
That creates opportunities for symbiosis.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:30.880
You have someone responding to part of a challenge
and saying, "Why, I could really knock this

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:35.790
thing off if I just work with someone like
this to figure out the challenge."

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:41.429
It creates a natural seed for symbiotic partnerships.

00:31:41.429 --> 00:31:46.630
If the challenges organize correctly and if
the incentives are in place in the right way,

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:50.550
you get this learning from success because
you reiterate challenges, maybe make them

00:31:50.550 --> 00:31:55.470
more difficult the next generation, and take
those successful designs and put them back

00:31:55.470 --> 00:32:01.059
into this machine so that overall, you get
this system that is continually generating

00:32:01.059 --> 00:32:05.370
new adaptive responses.

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:12.800
And so I'm going to close with a few quick
examples of how this is being done.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.770
You've probably heard of DARPA's grand challenges.

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:20.450
Here's a small arm of the Department of Defense
that, instead of trying to develop some new

00:32:20.450 --> 00:32:25.860
technology by going to a single contractor
and waiting 30 years and going over budget

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:30.690
by bazillions of dollars and getting something
that doesn't actually solve the original problem,

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:37.040
which is the case time and time again with
military procurement programs, they just go

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:43.490
out and say, "Here's a challenge: design us
a completely remotely operated vehicle."

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:50.070
I know that that's recently been merged into
the Google vehicle idea.

00:32:50.070 --> 00:32:53.470
Those are challenges that attracted a ton
of attention.

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:56.150
They started several years ago.

00:32:56.150 --> 00:33:00.890
The amazing thing, which is important to recognize
about challenge-based problem solving, is

00:33:00.890 --> 00:33:04.890
the prize initially for their first grand
challenge was $1 million.

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:08.570
That's what I call couch change to the Department
of Defense.

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:14.770
Probably most of the respondents spent more
than $1 million responding to these challenges.

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:19.390
When the challenge is designed right, people
want to solve the challenge.

00:33:19.390 --> 00:33:25.170
It does not take a lot of resources to make
it work.

00:33:25.170 --> 00:33:31.230
3M discovered this, so 3M is by no means some
kind of huge adaptable great company that's

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:33.790
an exemplar of how to make an adaptable company.

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:37.880
They're a pretty traditional company, but
when they wanted to reduce their environmental

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:43.130
footprint, they didn't have the CEOs say,
"Everyone recycle 20% more.

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:44.500
Do it."

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:50.130
They had a challenge where they said, "Anyone
who can reduce our environmental footprint

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:52.050
in any way, give us your ideas."

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:55.820
So you had administrative assistants over
here saying, "Oh yeah, we could reduce a lot

00:33:55.820 --> 00:34:00.800
of paper if we did this" and you had chemists
over there each responding in their own little

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.941
part of that world and saying, "Oh yeah, we
could reduce our chemical waste a lot if we

00:34:04.941 --> 00:34:08.020
just reconfigured these fume hoods" or something
like that.

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:14.990
3M got over 8,000 different successful responses
to this challenge, saved them hundreds of

00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:16.399
millions of dollars.

00:34:16.399 --> 00:34:18.659
They massively reduced their environmental
footprint.

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:23.509
And really all employees got for participation
was a certificate.

00:34:23.509 --> 00:34:26.789
Again, not a lot of motivation needed.

00:34:26.789 --> 00:34:29.780
We've seen it in the environment.

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:33.769
Instead of having the government say, "All
fishermen reduce your by-catch" -- that's

00:34:33.769 --> 00:34:38.700
a wasteful species that are caught that are
not the targeted species, that fishermen have

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:44.450
to throw back, usually to die, because they've
taken up their nets.

00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:48.739
Environmental groups and fishermen groups
issued a challenge: $50,000 to anyone who

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:53.450
could come up with better technology, gear
technology, or ways of fishing that will reduce

00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:56.480
your by-catch without reducing your value
catch.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:00.410
This is a challenge that's gone on year after
year, so you're getting better and better

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:05.309
designs, and they're coming from the people
who are experiencing the problem out where

00:35:05.309 --> 00:35:11.089
the problem is occurring, not back in Washington
where the rule makers are.

00:35:11.089 --> 00:35:17.749
Finally, as a last example, in my own classes
as a professor, I have for years been putting

00:35:17.749 --> 00:35:21.810
up this mocking diagram of the Department
of Homeland Security and chuckling about it

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:24.289
with audiences: "Look how inadaptable that
is!"

00:35:24.289 --> 00:35:26.619
And then I realized, "Wait a second.

00:35:26.619 --> 00:35:32.660
My classes look just like the Department of
Homeland Security" because in a typical class,

00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:38.170
if the circle is me as a professor, and the
triangle is the class period, I'm bringing

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:40.539
in a little bit of information.

00:35:40.539 --> 00:35:44.270
Information I've decided on.

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:46.220
I'm feeding that into the classroom.

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:50.650
[pause] [noise in background] It's really
noisy.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:57.259
[pause] I'm feeding that into the classroom
and all my students are expected basically

00:35:57.259 --> 00:35:59.829
to follow what's going on.

00:35:59.829 --> 00:36:02.650
And I wonder why most of my students are checked
out.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:06.869
I get a few Chatty Cathy's who are talking
all the time, and then the rest are just texting

00:36:06.869 --> 00:36:09.309
under their table.

00:36:09.309 --> 00:36:14.720
So what I started to do is go into class on
the first day of the semester and I rip up

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.319
the syllabus.

00:36:17.319 --> 00:36:18.920
And I say, "You know what?

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.430
You guys all took this class on marine conservation,
say.

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:25.839
You want to know something about it, and I
don't know exactly what that is, so you tell

00:36:25.839 --> 00:36:30.670
me what you want to know about marine conservation,
and you also tell me what you can share with

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:33.369
me about marine conservation.

00:36:33.369 --> 00:36:34.530
We'll build the class from that."

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:39.680
The first day, we build the entire semester,
what we're going to talk about.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:45.109
I have students leading every class period
with some lead topic.

00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:51.700
For every class period, I have the rest of
the students put on a riff off that main topic

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.420
onto a course wiki site.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:59.059
So there might be a main topic, and then students
just, before midnight, on the night before

00:36:59.059 --> 00:37:04.260
class, have to add something: a YouTube video,
a paper, some personal experience that they

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:07.089
had that relates to the main topic.

00:37:07.089 --> 00:37:10.589
What happens then is you get a class that
looks like this.

00:37:10.589 --> 00:37:15.670
Now the class is gathering information from
all kinds of different sources, not just the

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:18.339
one or two that I've selected for that day.

00:37:18.339 --> 00:37:24.349
But we're getting government reports, we're
getting artworks, we're getting personal experiences,

00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:28.569
more literature, we're getting information
from other professors, other classes they

00:37:28.569 --> 00:37:29.569
took.

00:37:29.569 --> 00:37:33.609
It's all feeding into this class, and I'm
just sitting out here on the side, not really

00:37:33.609 --> 00:37:38.500
needing to do everything because everyone
in that class is fired up and ready to talk

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.170
about it.

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:44.839
This idea of just ripping up the syllabus
and letting those independent sensors work

00:37:44.839 --> 00:37:49.430
on the problem, if you will, is exactly the
same as going into a meeting and ripping up

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:53.009
the agenda, and saying, "We're in this room
together.

00:37:53.009 --> 00:37:57.089
If there's a reason we should be in this room
together, let me know what it is.

00:37:57.089 --> 00:38:01.190
And if not, let's not have this meeting."

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:05.239
The other little tricky thing about that,
the reason I have a syllabus in the first

00:38:05.239 --> 00:38:09.000
place, is because my dean requires me to have
a syllabus.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:15.109
That's the last lesson about imparting these
adaptable ideas into a system that may not

00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:18.920
be so adaptable: you want to do it like a
virus.

00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:23.050
Like a virus that has a protein coat when
it comes into the body which is protecting

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.279
it from an immune response.

00:38:25.279 --> 00:38:26.619
Like a cloak.

00:38:26.619 --> 00:38:30.660
You want to sneak in there, get it started.

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:37.130
By the time you're discovered, you're proliferated
enough that you're beyond reproach.

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:39.460
I've run these classes for several years now.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.500
I dutifully put in my syllabus.

00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:46.710
But I've also been evaluating them every year
with an independent evaluation so that now,

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:51.299
when my dean finally discovers that I've been
ripping up the syllabus, I have a body of

00:38:51.299 --> 00:38:54.010
work and I can say, "Look, I've learned from
my success every year.

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:55.910
The students love this kind of class.

00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:57.420
They're way more into it.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:00.059
My evaluations are off the charts."

00:39:00.059 --> 00:39:04.109
That's how you want to build it up, rather
than trying to break it all down to begin

00:39:04.109 --> 00:39:05.109
with.

00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:09.249
This is exactly what soldiers in Iraq and
Afghanistan that I talked to did.

00:39:09.249 --> 00:39:13.329
They did a lot of things that were outside
the standard operating procedure.

00:39:13.329 --> 00:39:17.930
But they cloaked what they were doing until
they were successful, and then they shared

00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:20.259
that success with other commanders.

00:39:20.259 --> 00:39:24.279
And it started spreading like that.

00:39:24.279 --> 00:39:29.270
The basic idea here is that it's not just
about security.

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:34.609
It's about anywhere where the future is unpredictable,
where there's risk, that using ideas from

00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:39.390
nature about how to be adaptable can be extremely
helpful.

00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:43.010
There's lots of other examples in the book
and on my websites there.

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:45.560
And I'm happy to discuss them with you now.

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:50.450
Thank you so much.

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:55.059
[applause]
And I think there's a microphone because we're

00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:57.529
being filmed, if you have questions.

00:39:57.529 --> 00:39:59.140
[pause] [water bottle opening]

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.749
&gt;&gt;male#1: I'll start with--.

00:40:00.749 --> 00:40:03.579
Hello, I'll start with one quick question.

00:40:03.579 --> 00:40:06.749
Did you do all of the drawings and sketches
for your presentation?

00:40:06.749 --> 00:40:13.609
&gt;&gt;Rafe Sagarin: Yes, I used to [laughs] I
used to use Google images to steal my drawings

00:40:13.609 --> 00:40:15.920
and images from the internet.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.779
I don't know if any of you do that.

00:40:17.779 --> 00:40:26.200
But I discovered that I do have some paid
speaking gigs, and suddenly my life of being

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:32.920
within what I consider fair use at the university
and in various talks that I usually give didn't

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.039
seem quite so justifiable anymore.

00:40:35.039 --> 00:40:39.859
So I just said, "I'm just going to draw my
own stuff so it's copyright -- so I own the

00:40:39.859 --> 00:40:42.930
copyright."

00:40:42.930 --> 00:40:46.630
And that has been a long process because,
let me tell you, it's been a lot of years

00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:50.400
of downloading images from Google.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:54.499
I'm building up back a legal library of images
to use.

00:40:54.499 --> 00:40:57.599
&gt;&gt;female#1: Hi, I'm Alex.

00:40:57.599 --> 00:41:03.799
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Rafe Sagarin: Alex, you have a question?

00:41:03.799 --> 00:41:04.799
[laughs]

00:41:04.799 --> 00:41:09.220
&gt;&gt;male audience member: I love Alex!

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:10.769
[laughter] [pause]

00:41:10.769 --> 00:41:13.099
&gt;&gt;Rafe Sagarin: Yeah.

00:41:13.099 --> 00:41:20.280
&gt;&gt;male#3: I'm curious to hear how, as you've
been learning in the book, and just, I guess

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.280
studying this, what the policy makers' reception
has been?

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:22.280
And I think some of what you hear in the past
about the counter-insurgency during war has

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:27.480
been about being a lot more adaptable and
listening more, so you can already see some

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:33.250
of this stuff but I'm just curious now what
the reaction you've gotten was.

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:38.499
&gt;&gt;Yeah, so the question was, "What's the reaction
from policy makers and such?"

00:41:38.499 --> 00:41:43.460
From the very beginning of this project, which
was quite a few years ago, to the present,

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:49.700
I have been getting an unbelievably positive
and enthusiastic and interested response,

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:56.640
especially from policy makers and people who
are on the ground dealing with security threats

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.210
because, again, they've all been hearing this
charge.

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:02.190
Some of them have been ordered to be more
adaptable.

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:06.239
And yet, they don't really know where to start
with that.

00:42:06.239 --> 00:42:11.239
So I've really tried, especially in this book,
to put it into terms where you can do it no

00:42:11.239 --> 00:42:14.920
matter where you are in an organization or
where you are in your life.

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:20.170
You don't have to be the Secretary of the
Department of Homeland Security to implement

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:21.170
these things.

00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:26.220
You can be the kind of middle manager that
I frequently talk to.

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:33.299
Just by changing into this challenge-based
mode, you can start to inoculate these ideas,

00:42:33.299 --> 00:42:39.869
so I've got actually a very positive response,
especially from the security world.

00:42:39.869 --> 00:42:40.869
Yeah.

00:42:40.869 --> 00:42:50.349
&gt;&gt;male#4: So, you talked a lot about adaptability
and a lot about dynamic systems, but it's

00:42:50.349 --> 00:42:55.480
not really clear what exactly the definition
of adaptability is.

00:42:55.480 --> 00:43:01.430
I mean, we have a naive understanding of it,
but I can't really think of a formal definition

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:03.079
that fits in with everything.

00:43:03.079 --> 00:43:06.700
&gt;&gt;Rafe Sagarin: Yeah, you can make a formal
definition for adaptability.

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:07.700
There's been a bunch.

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:13.260
It's changing in response to changes in the
environment or something like that.

00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:21.200
But I much prefer to define it by showing
how it's been done in many different cases

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:29.270
over billions of years, because part of getting
value out of the concept of adaptability is

00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:36.990
to see all the diverse ways in which adaptable
systems have used it.

00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:43.079
A ground squirrel does it completely differently
than an octopus, but they both run around

00:43:43.079 --> 00:43:48.839
these same basic themes of decentralized approaches
and how to use information and how to use

00:43:48.839 --> 00:43:51.460
symbiosis.

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:56.680
It's a simple concept, just changing in response
to a changing environment, but it's that diversity

00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:01.829
underneath the concept, and the fact that
that diversity coalesces around a few key

00:44:01.829 --> 00:44:08.819
themes that makes it such a powerful concept
for use.

00:44:08.819 --> 00:44:16.190
[pause]
You think you want to ask another question?

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:20.650
[laughs] Yeah.

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:31.400
&gt;&gt; male#5: I guess one question is about the
speed of adaptability or the speed of change.

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.400
We think about the Department of Defense,
or RIAM, or Google as fairly large organizations

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.470
who take a long time to adapt.

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:40.690
Species generally take a long time to adapt.

00:44:40.690 --> 00:44:48.059
You could argue the octopus changes in a few
minutes underwater.

00:44:48.059 --> 00:44:49.412
As you mentioned, there's different ways of
defining adaptability, but it seems like it

00:44:49.412 --> 00:44:50.412
can often take centuries.

00:44:50.412 --> 00:44:51.412
I guess I'm curious to hear how organizations
often just don't have that kind of time on

00:44:51.412 --> 00:44:52.412
their hands.

00:44:52.412 --> 00:44:53.520
&gt;&gt;Rafe Sagarin: I'm glad you raise the issue
of the timing of adaptation, because there's

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.470
a lot of misconceptions out there.

00:44:55.470 --> 00:45:01.289
We often think of adaptation as this huge
multigenerational thing that will only be

00:45:01.289 --> 00:45:05.890
apparent once you look back in millions of
years at the fossil record.

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:12.230
But in fact, like most biological systems,
and I talk about this in the book a lot, biological

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:14.960
systems are nested in every way.

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:20.650
The same kind of things you see at the genetic
level occur at the cellular level, at the

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:23.460
organismal level, at the ecosystem level.

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:27.519
They're nested, and it's likewise nested in
time.

00:45:27.519 --> 00:45:30.869
Adaptability occurs on all these different
nested time scales.

00:45:30.869 --> 00:45:33.400
It occurs virtually instantly.

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:36.210
It occurs fairly quickly like the octopus
changing color.

00:45:36.210 --> 00:45:39.839
And yes, it occurs over multiple multiple
generations.

00:45:39.839 --> 00:45:45.329
But the more we've looked into, as biologists,
adaptable systems, the more we're understanding

00:45:45.329 --> 00:45:47.910
that it's spread across this full spectrum.

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:53.109
We're just learning, right now literally,
that even our genetic structures are adapting

00:45:53.109 --> 00:46:01.099
in real time and doing some very radical changes
in real time with gene jumping kind of things.

00:46:01.099 --> 00:46:06.190
So there's really no limits on the timing
of adaptation.

00:46:06.190 --> 00:46:11.869
[pause]
All right.

00:46:11.869 --> 00:46:16.490
Like I said, please contact me with other
ideas.

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:20.059
Some of them will pop up as you read the book.

00:46:20.059 --> 00:46:21.190
Please tell your friends about it.

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:22.739
Thanks for coming.

00:46:22.739 --> 00:46:23.889
[applause]
