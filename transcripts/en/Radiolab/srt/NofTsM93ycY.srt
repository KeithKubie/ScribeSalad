1
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:08,440
It's time now to practice some very
useful phrases. I'll say them first.

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:11,620
You repeat, I will learn
together. That's begin.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,560
This is radio lab today. Translation.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,680
It's time to begin.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,700
We'll have eight experiments
in translation. Transcreation

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,540
lesson number one. The
best poem was by my mother.

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,410
[inaudible] people would
be my mom. No, you try it.

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,960
Hello. Hi there. Hi. Is
that dog? Yes. Oh boy.

9
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,030
So, uh, this episode was inspired
by a guy named Doug Doug Hofstadter,

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,060
professor of cognitive science,
Indiana University Bloomington. Uh,

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,060
you may know him as the guy
who wrote Godel Escher Bach,

12
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,620
which was a hugely influential
book in certain circles, uh,

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,010
published in I think 1979 but we
actually got interested in him. Uh,

14
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,610
thanks to our producer Lynn Levy
because of an obsession of his,

15
00:00:56,611 --> 00:00:59,490
which predates that 16, I was 16,

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,980
the year 1961.

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,840
I was taking a French literature class
on one day. I came across this poem,

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,710
a tiny little poem that kind of sat
right in the middle of the page,

19
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,780
like a long thin sausage vertical. Ah,

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,840
three syllables per line.

21
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:23,700
So it was super skinny and 28 lines
long and long and it was delightful.

22
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:25,740
It was very cute and funny.

23
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,590
I fell in love with a poem
immediately and memorized that.

24
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,650
I still know it by heart. The
poem is basically a Getwell card.

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,570
It was written by this guy, Clemon morrow,

26
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,800
who was a poet in the early 15
hundreds the court of a queen.

27
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,770
And he wrote the poem for
a, this Queen's daughter.

28
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:45,420
She was seven or eight and she had gotten
sick of flu or something and this poem

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,780
was supposed to cheer her up and,
and her thought was very sweet.

30
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,350
Could you say it in French? Let's just
hear it first. Yeah. Okay. It's called,

31
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:58,070
uh, Yoon dumb. Was that in
Malad to a sick demos El,

32
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,430
so to speak, like young
lady, a sick young lady, Mami

33
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,740
[inaudible], Lucy [inaudible], [inaudible]

34
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,420
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] at the taboo. Shh.

35
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,880
[inaudible] Emoji comfy too. You see,

36
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,150
you do your Tomala cooler fat
two pound a paradol on bone.

37
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:26,180
Poor Joe to Diwan Asante Burn Armenian.

38
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,960
Oh my God. You must have gotten so
many chicks when you were six, seven.

39
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:35,920
That was really crazy.
Exactly the opposite. I was,

40
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:40,600
I was a wish. Okay, so he reads the poem,

41
00:02:40,601 --> 00:02:43,990
files it away deep in the corner of
his mind. Fast forward about 20 years,

42
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:45,250
he publishes his first book.

43
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:50,110
He becomes very popular and the publisher
decides to have it translate into a

44
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:53,950
number of languages, including French.
And that process, which took years,

45
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,230
it put me into the frame
of mind of thinking,

46
00:02:56,231 --> 00:03:01,231
what kinds of crazy things can happen
when you crazy texts and all of a sudden

47
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:07,060
one day that poem popped
into his mind and I said, ah,

48
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:12,430
there's a challenge. Let's try to
do this. And when you say challenge,

49
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:14,950
like what was it? What is it?
What is the challenge? Okay,

50
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,820
what I meant was to say, here's the
thing. He says, you got this poem.

51
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,870
[inaudible] if you just
focus on the words,

52
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:26,290
it's basically just this guy talking to
a younger girl saying, hello my dear.

53
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,500
I'm sorry you're sick.
Being sick is like prison.

54
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,930
I Claremont wish you to open your doors,

55
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:35,410
get out into the world clean loaned of
women. Get out of bed, eat some jam.

56
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:39,670
If you too, so you don't look so
pale, loose your plump shade pill dog,

57
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,680
you know, it's sort of like get better.

58
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:45,100
Here's to your good health due
to the [inaudible], I mean young,

59
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:50,170
but just saying those words in English
misses the whole spirit of the poem,

60
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,030
the tone, the lightheartedness.
And, and this is key for Doug.

61
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,800
It also ignores the poems form.

62
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:01,120
It's wonderfully catchy little
sausage shape on the page.

63
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:05,410
The fact that the lines rhyme,
you know, a, B, B, c, c, d,

64
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:10,600
and uh, the first line [inaudible]
is identical to the last line.

65
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,150
I mean, young sorta has
the feel of a palindrome.

66
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,800
It has the poet's name in the middle of
the poem. [inaudible] oh, and I forgot,

67
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:20,530
did I say three syllables per law?
You didn't that, yeah, of course.

68
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:25,270
Three syllables per line. I mean, that's
crucial. And then also 28 lines long.

69
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,390
So all of those things added up to a
set of constraints you might say on me.

70
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,230
So Doug sat down and got to work and uh,

71
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,710
quickly became embroiled
in the question of like,

72
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:38,630
how do you translate this poem? You know,

73
00:04:38,631 --> 00:04:43,400
along the way he even began to make
a little grids of possibilities for

74
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,860
different lines of the poem. For example,

75
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,900
who yawned at the top Bush like this
line that basically says don't wallow in

76
00:04:50,901 --> 00:04:55,230
bed. I had a lot of possibilities
and I'll just read you the uh,

77
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,980
little diagonal display here.

78
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,720
Instead of spurting blood in bed
instead of burping in your bed,

79
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:06,750
instead of bursting out in bed instead
of lurking in Europe instead of hurtling

80
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,320
out of instead of hurting there and
instead of squirming and your instead of

81
00:05:11,321 --> 00:05:16,321
slurping slop and instead of burning up
in bed instead of turning blue in bed on

82
00:05:17,281 --> 00:05:22,200
and on. And I came up with, you want
me to read my first translation please?

83
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,060
My sweet dear. I sent you
all the best. You're forced.

84
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:31,200
Rest is like jail, so don't
ale very long. Just get strong.

85
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,010
Go outside, take a ride,
do it quick. Stay not sick.

86
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:40,020
Ban Your ache for my sake. Buttered
bread while in bed. Makes a mess.

87
00:05:40,021 --> 00:05:42,510
So unless you would choose that bad news,

88
00:05:42,511 --> 00:05:46,920
I suggest that you'd best soon
arise so your eyes will not glaze.

89
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,680
Douglass. Praise health. Be
Near my sweet dear. So whoa.

90
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,770
So claymores now Douglas clean
all became Douglas and I,

91
00:05:56,771 --> 00:06:00,750
I the word John Jam became bread though.
Buttered to bread. Buttered bread.

92
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,540
Buttered bread. Yes. Well I just
figure jam and Jelly. They are words,

93
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,100
but the words represent concepts and
the concept have a kind of a halo around

94
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:11,930
them. I mean when you talk about Jelly,

95
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,790
you're implicitly talking about bread
and things that you spread it on.

96
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,730
Oh, how interesting. People like
just stick their fingers in Jelly.

97
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,730
No bread needed. Okay. Okay, fair enough.

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,650
Feeling like he hadn't quite nailed it.

99
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:28,100
Doug sent the poem to one of the guys
that translated his first book into

100
00:06:28,101 --> 00:06:31,160
French. Yeah. A guy named oddly enough,

101
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:36,230
Bob French and Bob was and I said,

102
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:40,360
hey Bob, can you do it?
And uh, Bob said, wow,

103
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,750
give it a try. Fairest friend
letting me send my embrace.

104
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,940
Quit this place. It's dark
holes and dank walls in soft,

105
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:54,380
still regain health dress and
flea off with me. Clement,

106
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,530
who calls for you,

107
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,170
very different in tone and
really quite marvelous.

108
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,580
He got the a pale face in there. He got
the gym claimant's name in the middle,

109
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:07,400
but at the same time it
didn't have the lightness.

110
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:12,170
The tone is much more ancient, which you
could argue, well it's an ancient poem,

111
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,920
but Doug says, no, no, no, there's a
big a problem that was 30 lines long.

112
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:20,950
So extra long and 28
was a sacrosanct number.

113
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,990
That's just two lines
though. No, no, no, no, no.

114
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:28,730
Klemow Maho wrote a three syllable poem
of 28 lines that rhymed wonderfully.

115
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:33,500
And the essence of his poem
was a form rather than a,

116
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,940
uh, than a message that is, the message
was get well, which is pretty simple.

117
00:07:37,941 --> 00:07:40,130
But Doug would argue no, it was the form.

118
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,010
That's what made the
thing funny and charming.

119
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:47,300
And so the question for him was who
could get the feel but nail the form?

120
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,470
To make a long story short, he ended up
sending the poem out to like 60 people,

121
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,340
doctoral students, whom I,
sweet. I entreat one regard,

122
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,960
Otis hard dear recluse
colleagues, friends chickadee.

123
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,340
I decree a fine day.

124
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,930
Even got his wife to do one dart away
from your cage and engage in brave flight

125
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:10,340
so you might flee the croup. That was
all bird themed. Hope you swoop into ham,

126
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,240
apple jam and French bridge. You go
running around from town to town saying,

127
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,740
hey, I got a little poem.

128
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:19,550
Anybody want to [inaudible]
I am a person of binges.

129
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,370
This began a binge.

130
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,520
She might say in that binge ended up
becoming a 700 page book filled with

131
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:30,620
translations of this poem. Go ahead and
read the last one. Now this is the bell,

132
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:32,630
right? Right. No, this
is not the best one.

133
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:37,250
This is just that one and I'll
stop it. Okay, here we go. Okay.

134
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:41,990
Okay. This is also one of his, but like
the 20th one he did POW petite Gal.

135
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:46,010
So sweet hug from duck, some
dumb bug dragged you down.

136
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,420
Zap that fram feel the urge
bugs to purge from the scourge.

137
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:55,290
You'll emerge in a Trice sound
advice from ham dunk slash. Clem.

138
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:00,710
So smash flu come you who come
you who lived at you sheets.

139
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,440
S eschew sweet. Let's Chew Papa Tart.

140
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,300
Make your heart palpitate. Klemm's
mandate. Sure. Hope God cures your body.

141
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,160
Head to feet. Pound
there, hub got your mind

142
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,530
set in the red. It's humorous,
although not the best. He says,

143
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,700
I do want to get to my
mother's translation speakers.

144
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,570
My mother's was somehow, I'm
going to have to look it up here.

145
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:31,590
Where it was. It was that this
book is long and complicated than

146
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,460
this one from his mom. He says came
along years after he started. Sure it is,

147
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:41,640
and he thinks that might be the winter
high. Twits get well, hospitals,

148
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:44,460
prison and prisons. Hell,
get well. Flea yourself.

149
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,050
Clements orders in a nutshell.
Go pig out. Open wide your mouth.

150
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,270
Keep those sweetmeats going south. Unless
you're hail, you'll turn Pale loose.

151
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:58,440
Ooh, la La. That wiggles your tail.
God restore good health to you.

152
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,710
My little flower.

153
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,510
Oh, that's cool.

154
00:10:04,511 --> 00:10:09,030
I noticed that she doesn't begin the
poem and end the poem with the same line.

155
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:12,830
She doesn't have 28 lines. She
has maybe about 16 lines. Uh,

156
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,430
she doesn't pay any attention
to syllable counts. I did.

157
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:22,320
My first reaction was, oh
mom, no mom, come on, come on.

158
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:25,710
I didn't pay any attention to
the form and, and she said,

159
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,480
I did what I wanted to do. This is my
feeling, you know, that's what I did.

160
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,610
And actually, you know,

161
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:36,450
I have to say it has
stood the test of time.

162
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:40,560
It has some kind of pizazz
that no other one ever had.

163
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,560
But if she didn't respect the
form, he didn't do the syllable.

164
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:46,480
She didn't rhyme it the way it's supposed
to rhyme. She didn't give you 28 line.

165
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:50,910
She even like have that practically set
a translation then or is that just a

166
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,150
mom? I left a hundred flowers bloom.

167
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,080
As I got more and more deeply into this
poem and my philosophy started to become

168
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:05,580
Chairman Mao's statement, let 100
flowers bloom. In other words,

169
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:10,790
you can look at it from so many angles
and each new angle enriches it and makes

170
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:12,840
it more fun.

171
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:17,160
But you can't read a hundred versions of
every poem that you want to read. Okay?

172
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,400
Okay. I agree. You're right. It
does make me question though.

173
00:11:20,401 --> 00:11:24,510
The rules of engagement in a way.
There are no rules. There are no rules.

174
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,340
It's all informal. Okay?

175
00:11:26,341 --> 00:11:30,780
But there's jam in one of the translations
and ham in the other and they're

176
00:11:30,781 --> 00:11:31,020
like,

177
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,910
they're factually different foods and
substances somehow like the facts of the

178
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:39,390
poem shouldn't be negotiable should
they? What is, what do you mean by fact?

179
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:44,220
I mean, the fact about the poem is that
it was written by somebody in French.

180
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,190
It's not in French anymore. Now,

181
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:49,310
here's what Jared I think
was really wondering is, uh,

182
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,600
the mission we thought was,

183
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,640
what was he saying?

184
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:57,100
Not what do we make of what he's saying?

185
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:58,450
What are the flavors of what he's saying?

186
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,570
What are the variants of what
he's saying beyond that? Like,

187
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,610
isn't the expectation that you as
a translator are giving me him?

188
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:07,781
Like, hey this,

189
00:12:07,781 --> 00:12:12,580
this man has lost to time and now
suddenly I get to experience him,

190
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,800
but if a hundred flowers are blooming,

191
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:17,350
that somehow feels like
I'm not getting him at all.

192
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,640
Obviously you're getting to the
question of what is translation and Ah,

193
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,410
can it be done? My,

194
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:28,060
my feeling is that even though these
translations that we've heard are all very

195
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:32,860
different, they all show something about

196
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:38,380
Clayman Moho Doug's basic point is that
like any person is kind of a universe,

197
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:41,500
they're too big to
comprehend in their entirety.

198
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,450
And so any translation of say,

199
00:12:43,451 --> 00:12:47,290
a poem or whatever is only going to
get you a tiny piece of that person.

200
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:51,370
A tiny refraction. I mean, look, we
have one photograph of Fredrick Chopin

201
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:52,670
[inaudible]

202
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:57,660
one photograph, and in that
picture he says, ah, he scowling.

203
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:02,940
What did Fredrick Chopin really look
like? What was his smile? You know,

204
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:05,610
you look at a photograph
of Chopin and you say, oh,

205
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:09,750
this is what Chopin looked like. Well,
no, Chopin looked like many things.

206
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,720
Even the very day that
that photograph was taken,

207
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,020
he had thousands of different
expressions on his face.

208
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,380
But then what about a year earlier
or 10 years earlier? I mean,

209
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,160
knowing Chopin is a very complex
thing. It's not one thing.

210
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:28,200
It's a millions of different
things that we're United by analogy

211
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:30,890
[inaudible]

212
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:33,740
into something that we
refer to as one thing.

213
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:43,560
[inaudible] [inaudible]

214
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,220
we should say we looked into it and there
are actually two pictures of Chopin,

215
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,980
but he's kind of scowling and both are,

216
00:13:49,981 --> 00:13:53,250
you can't really tell him the second
one to disintegrate. No smiles.

217
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,263
[inaudible] [inaudible]

218
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,033
