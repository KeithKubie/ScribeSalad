the neurology of reading is another

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040
the neurology of reading is another
 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.710
the neurology of reading is another
thing that people are writing about and

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720
thing that people are writing about and
 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.950
thing that people are writing about and
investigating a lot that is what happens

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960
investigating a lot that is what happens
 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.999
investigating a lot that is what happens
in your brain when you rage it turns out

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009
in your brain when you rage it turns out
 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.379
in your brain when you rage it turns out
because I know a friend who had this

kind of stroke you can have a kind of

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820
kind of stroke you can have a kind of
 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.170
kind of stroke you can have a kind of
stroke that makes it possible for you to

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180
stroke that makes it possible for you to
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.630
stroke that makes it possible for you to
write you can still write but you can't

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640
write you can still write but you can't
 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.140
write you can still write but you can't
read what you've just written so reading

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150
read what you've just written so reading
 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.460
read what you've just written so reading
and writing you would think would be in

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470
and writing you would think would be in
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.939
and writing you would think would be in
the same little little box in the brain

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949
the same little little box in the brain
 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.810
the same little little box in the brain
but but they're not anything that we do

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820

platform or program which is then

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780
platform or program which is then
 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.050
platform or program which is then
adopted for other uses so language is

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060
adopted for other uses so language is
 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.750
adopted for other uses so language is
pretty old and it's also built in some

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760
pretty old and it's also built in some
 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.990

children arrive in the world and then

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000
children arrive in the world and then
 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.760
children arrive in the world and then
they pick up language just by being

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770
they pick up language just by being
 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.920
they pick up language just by being
around other people who are talking

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930
around other people who are talking
 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.399

nobody sits down and teaches them

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409
nobody sits down and teaches them
 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.840
nobody sits down and teaches them
reading on the other hand you will not

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850
reading on the other hand you will not
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.889
reading on the other hand you will not
pick up unless somebody will spend some

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899
pick up unless somebody will spend some
 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.859
pick up unless somebody will spend some
time with you and writing is even

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869
time with you and writing is even
 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.010
time with you and writing is even
writing by hand as apparently even even

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020
writing by hand as apparently even even
 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.950
writing by hand as apparently even even
harder so what are the platforms that

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960
harder so what are the platforms that
 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.050
harder so what are the platforms that
that these things are built on and it

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060
that these things are built on and it
 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.510
that these things are built on and it
has been proposed that reading is built

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
has been proposed that reading is built
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.969
has been proposed that reading is built
on a very ancient program that had to do

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979
on a very ancient program that had to do
 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.239
on a very ancient program that had to do
with with reading animal tracks

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:34.249
with with reading animal tracks
 

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:36.260
with with reading animal tracks
so what you're doing is you're looking

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270
so what you're doing is you're looking
 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.010
so what you're doing is you're looking
at visual signs made by somebody else

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020
at visual signs made by somebody else
 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.069
at visual signs made by somebody else
and you are interpreting those back into

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079
and you are interpreting those back into
 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.830
and you are interpreting those back into
a story that originally of course

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840
a story that originally of course
 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.499
a story that originally of course
allowed you to track the animal or to

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509
allowed you to track the animal or to
 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.669
allowed you to track the animal or to
figure out if an animal was tracking you

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679
figure out if an animal was tracking you
 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:53.620
figure out if an animal was tracking you
equally important

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630
equally important
 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.450
equally important
you were able to tell what was around in

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460
you were able to tell what was around in
 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.300
you were able to tell what was around in
your vicinity by reading those tracks so

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310
your vicinity by reading those tracks so
 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.569
your vicinity by reading those tracks so
what are those marks we make what are

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579
what are those marks we make what are
 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.840
what are those marks we make what are
those marks on a sheet of paper piece of

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850
those marks on a sheet of paper piece of
 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.529
those marks on a sheet of paper piece of
stone clay tablet they're like animal

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539
stone clay tablet they're like animal
 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.870
stone clay tablet they're like animal
tracks and that we look at them we and

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880
tracks and that we look at them we and
 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.300
tracks and that we look at them we and
we translate them back into something

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310
we translate them back into something
 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:15.740
we translate them back into something
which which

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750
which which
 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:22.430
which which
language and that language can be put

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440
language and that language can be put
 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.360
language and that language can be put
together in our brains to tell a story

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370
together in our brains to tell a story
 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.740
together in our brains to tell a story
create a poem

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750
create a poem
 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.760
create a poem
whatever the writing may have been as

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770
whatever the writing may have been as
 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.390
whatever the writing may have been as
for the writing those are the tracks we

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400
for the writing those are the tracks we
 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.990
for the writing those are the tracks we
make so that's probably based on some

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000
make so that's probably based on some
 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000
make so that's probably based on some
sort of display or marking program and

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010
sort of display or marking program and
 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.520
sort of display or marking program and
that too is pretty old if you go back to

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530
that too is pretty old if you go back to
 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.070
that too is pretty old if you go back to
cave painting so the handprints on the

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080
cave painting so the handprints on the
 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.800
cave painting so the handprints on the
cave drawings on the cave the markings

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810
cave drawings on the cave the markings
 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.210
cave drawings on the cave the markings
the pieces of stone or bone that they've

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220
the pieces of stone or bone that they've
 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.880
the pieces of stone or bone that they've
now found with rhythmic scratches on

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890
now found with rhythmic scratches on
 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.920
now found with rhythmic scratches on
them they're they're all forms of

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930
them they're they're all forms of
 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.660
them they're they're all forms of
signaling so it took a while for that to

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670
signaling so it took a while for that to
 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.280
signaling so it took a while for that to
to become what we now know as as

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290
to become what we now know as as
 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.670
to become what we now know as as
alphabets or language systems but it

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680
alphabets or language systems but it
 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.660
alphabets or language systems but it
probably all had its origins in that

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670
probably all had its origins in that
 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.729
probably all had its origins in that
form of marking and somebody has a

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739
form of marking and somebody has a
 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.680
form of marking and somebody has a
theory that all of the alphabets are

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690
theory that all of the alphabets are
 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.350
theory that all of the alphabets are
taken from from natural that they had

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360
taken from from natural that they had
 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.750
taken from from natural that they had
their origins and natural signs from

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760
their origins and natural signs from
 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.880
their origins and natural signs from
pictographs of depicting natural things
