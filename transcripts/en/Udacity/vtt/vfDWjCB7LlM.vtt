00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, we're going to need to use one of our equations.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We're going to need to use the one that involves all of the variables

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
except for final velocity.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And that would be this equation.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Okay, using only numbers from the right column,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Δx, well that's actually Δy, 50 = V0  t, but that's 0  t. That's just 0.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Plus ½, I can use my 10 for the a, times t².

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Solving this, we get a result of 3.2 seconds.
