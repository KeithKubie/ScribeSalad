00:00:06.611 --> 00:00:08.545
When we think of classic works of art,

00:00:08.545 --> 00:00:12.364
the most common setting we imagine them in is a museum.

00:00:12.364 --> 00:00:14.815
But what we often forget is that much of this art

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:17.528
was not produced with a museum setting in mind.

00:00:17.528 --> 00:00:19.221
What happens to an artwork

00:00:19.221 --> 00:00:22.807
when it's taken out of its originally intended context?

00:00:22.807 --> 00:00:26.302
Take the example of Michelangelo's Statue of David,

00:00:26.302 --> 00:00:29.931
depicting the boy hero who slew the giant philistine, Goliath,

00:00:29.931 --> 00:00:33.051
armed with only his courage and his slingshot.

00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:37.291
When Michelangelo began carving a block of pure white marble

00:00:37.291 --> 00:00:39.558
to communicate this famous Biblical story,

00:00:39.558 --> 00:00:42.351
the city of Florence intended to place the finished product

00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:44.620
atop their grand cathedral.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.880
Not only would the 17 foot tall statue

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.995
be easily visible at this height,

00:00:48.995 --> 00:00:51.895
but its placement alongside 11 other statues

00:00:51.895 --> 00:00:55.055
of Old Testament heroes towering over onlookers

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.659
would have a powerful religious significance,

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.722
forcing the viewer to stare in awe towards the heavens.

00:01:01.722 --> 00:01:05.255
But by the time Michelangelo had finished the work, in 1504,

00:01:05.255 --> 00:01:08.381
the plans for the other statues had fallen through,

00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:11.729
and the city realized that lifting such a large sculpture to the roof

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.196
would be more difficult than they had thought.

00:01:14.196 --> 00:01:17.432
Furthermore, the statue was so detailed and lifelike,

00:01:17.432 --> 00:01:19.689
down to the bulging veins in David's arm

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.013
and the determination on his face,

00:01:22.013 --> 00:01:26.089
that it seemed a shame to hide it so far from the viewer.

00:01:26.089 --> 00:01:28.056
A council of politicians and artists

00:01:28.056 --> 00:01:31.436
convened to decide on a new location for the statue.

00:01:31.436 --> 00:01:34.928
Ultimately voting to place it in front of the Palazzo della Signoria,

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:38.564
the town hall and home of the new Republican government.

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:41.439
This new location transformed the statue's meaning.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.660
The Medici family, who for generations had ruled the city

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.386
through their control of banking, had recently been exiled,

00:01:48.386 --> 00:01:50.746
and Florence now saw itself as a free city,

00:01:50.746 --> 00:01:54.026
threatened on all sides by wealthy and powerful rivals.

00:01:54.026 --> 00:01:58.200
David, now the symbol of heroic resistance against overwhelming odds,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.290
was placed with his intense stare,

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.134
now a look of stern warning, focused directly towards Rome,

00:02:04.134 --> 00:02:06.819
the home of Cardinal Giovanni de Medici.

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.403
Though the statue itself had not been altered,

00:02:09.403 --> 00:02:12.267
its placement changed nearly every aspect of it

00:02:12.267 --> 00:02:15.106
from a religious to a political significance.

00:02:15.106 --> 00:02:18.524
Though a replica of David still appears at the Palazzo,

00:02:18.524 --> 00:02:21.415
the original statue was moved in 1873

00:02:21.415 --> 00:02:25.676
to the Galleria dell'Accademia, where it remains today.

00:02:25.676 --> 00:02:28.660
In the orderly, quiet environment of the museum,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.832
alongside numerous half-finished Michelangelo sculptures,

00:02:31.832 --> 00:02:35.205
overt religious and political interpretations fall away,

00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:38.220
giving way to detached contemplation of Michelangelo's

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.454
artistic and technical skill.

00:02:40.454 --> 00:02:43.118
But even here, the astute viewer may notice

00:02:43.118 --> 00:02:46.563
that David's head and hand appear disproportionately large,

00:02:46.563 --> 00:02:49.561
a reminder that they were made to be viewed from below.

00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:52.995
So, not only does context change the meaning

00:02:52.995 --> 00:02:55.680
and interpretation of an artwork throughout its history,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.136
sometimes it can make that history resurface

00:02:59.136 --> 00:03:01.172
in the most unexpected ways.
