00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.680
Let's see, these are those extra default things you were talking about?

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:06.090
&gt;&gt; Those are the extra tabs for us to be able to, you know, load some

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.310
files, run, make some reports on festivals if

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.620
we want to. but, what about in the upper-right

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.050
hand corner, you can see that we are in our festival application. If we were to

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.540
toggle between any of the other apps, it

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.750
would change the different tabs that we see because.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.030
&gt;&gt; What are these other apps. Those are just the standard ones

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:23.205
that come out of the box with your developer edition of the account.

00:00:23.205 --> 00:00:24.550
&gt;&gt; So are we going to use those or?

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.790
&gt;&gt; We aren't going to use

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:26.975
them no, probably not.

00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:27.360
[LAUGH].

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.990
But you can see how you can track different types of data

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.200
relevant to that app. So in sales, it's accounts, contacts, that kind of stuff.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.420
&gt;&gt; Okay, sorry. Festival App, right, stay focused.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.380
&gt;&gt; Let's create a new festival Okay, have O, right? Should, the new button?

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.700
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.190
&gt;&gt; Good. There's a lot of buttons. Sorry. festival name. What

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.530
do you think? Any good idea for a fake festival name?

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:49.170
&gt;&gt; Cloudstock.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.520
&gt;&gt; Cloudstock? That's a good one. Okay, it's like Woodstock in

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.165
the clouds.

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:55.040
[LAUGH].

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.340
Save.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.510
&gt;&gt; So, that's pretty awesome. You know, it's, it's

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.330
storing information about Cloudstock already, has some other fields

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.180
that we didn't even create ourselves, like who was

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.400
it created by, and who was it last modified by?

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.720
&gt;&gt; I don't see, sorry, created by? Oh

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.770
yeah, over here. Owner, last modified by, gotcha.
