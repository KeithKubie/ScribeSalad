&gt;&gt;Male Announcer: Hello Everyone.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.020
Thank you so much for coming.

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.860
This talk is part of the Authors @ Google
Series.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.850
We have a couple of other talks going on this
week, they are both actually tomorrow.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:18.190
Um, we have Gail Soalid talking about communication
and positive limit setting with young children.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.290
And we have a conversation with Nolan Bushnell
tomorrow.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.480
You can learn more about these at go/@google.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.539
But today we have Patricia Curtan and we are
proud to present her.

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.720
Patricia is an artist, designer and print
maker.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.110
She has a long association with Chez Panisse
Restaurant in Berkeley as a cook, a cookbook

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.250
co-author, designer and illustrator.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.760
She has designed and printed letter press
and linoleum blocks, special occasion menus

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.300
for Chez Panisse for several decades.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.760
The menus have been collected into her recently
published book Menus for Chez Panisse, which

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.210
will be on sale in the back for fifteen dollars.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.260
In addition to cookbooks and specialty printing
Patricia has designed images and typography

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:09.729
for logo identity, wine labels, product packaging,
calendars, note cards, book covers and tattoos.

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.670
Please join me in welcoming Patricia Curtan.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.250
&gt;&gt; Patricia: Hello, Thank you for inviting
me.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.740
It's really exciting to be at Google.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.729
I came to talk to you about my book and before
I get into exactly showing you all these things

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.529
I want to tell you a little bit about my background
and relationship to Chez Panisse, how this

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:36.100
came about.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.840
I actually started working at Chez Panisse
the first year it was opened in 1971, which

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.270
was forty years ago.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.310
The restaurant just celebrated it's 40th Anniversary.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:55.299
And at the time I was an intern at the print
shop of poster artist Davis Lance Goines in

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:01.119
Berkeley and that's how I come to know the
people, Alice, and the people at Chez Panisse

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.979
and ended up working there in the dining room.

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.170
And so for a time I worked at the day time
at the print shop and in the evenings at the

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.550
restaurant.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.629
And then I got very sort of swept up, and
very interested in all that was going on at

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.430
the restaurant.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.890
The incredible food and the energy there,
what was going on and I sort of started spending

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.840
less time at the print shop and morning then
in the pastry kitchen and then in the other

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:36.200
kitchens and eventually ended up spending
up most of my time in the kitchen and cooking.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.890
Which was a great, wonderful, adventure.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:49.660
And after a time I ended up then starting
a family and wanted to change that and so

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.530
I stopped cooking.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.719
And about that time Alice started getting
contracts to doing cookbooks and we worked

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:57.719
on the first drawing.

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:04.490
And then I just sort of flipped over from
cooking and went back to printing and design

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:11.939
and cookbooks but still working with Chez
Panisse and still working with Alice.

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:18.629
The, it's all still about the same thing which
is really about the beauty of food and but

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.370
now I work mostly in two dimensions.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.159
In printing and designing and in making images.

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:38.639
So this book, um, here's the dining room at
Chez Panisse about 5:30 before dinner begins.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:47.480
Itâ€™s a little small place, its very intimate
and these menus that are collected here were

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.519
made for primarily the downstairs dining room.

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:59.819
For special occasions such as birthdays, I'm
going to come back to these images, but birthdays,

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:10.180
anniversaries; there is an annual Bastille
Day dinner; there's New Year's Eve celebrations.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:18.090
And the book is organized chronologically,
so the menus start actually in 1972 and alongside

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:23.710
the menus are short text that tell sort of
different stories about maybe the events or

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:34.460
the person it was made for or some visiting
luminary or some other occasion.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:43.120
And, uh, before we get into me really showing
you those menus I want to tell you a little

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.642
bit about the process of how they are made.

00:04:44.642 --> 00:04:53.200
There are letter press menus and I have a
beautiful old cast iron letter press that

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:02.800
is called the Chandler and Price, C and P,
and it is a, it has a clam shell action that

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.780
sort of opens and closes like this.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:15.310
And the paper is fed into the press by hand,
it sits on the area called the platen, it's

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:22.569
a flat area of metal and that's the part that
closes and meets with the block or the type

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:23.720
or whatever is being printed.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.740
You can see the block there vertically.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:34.889
It's a one color press, prints one color of
ink at a time.

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:41.629
That's the ink plate and the rollers are spreading
the ink on the ink plate and the ink plate

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:46.560
slowly turns with each cycle of the press
and will distribute that ink evenly.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.460
Then it comes down and rolls over the surface
of the block and the press closes and prints

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.150
and paper comes out and new paper comes in.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:01.000
And [clears throat] it was built, and this
press is about one hundred and twenty years

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.610
old, still as solid as the day it was made.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:13.419
It was mainly built to print type, metal type,
hand-set and this is a sample of a little

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.169
bit of type setting.

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:24.069
Um, and that's a process that is pretty much
outdated now, purists still do it but it's

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:30.599
putting the type together letter by letter,
space by space, space between the lines, very,

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.840
very laborious and handmade.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:40.050
But recently, the last twenty years or so,
the advent of polymer plate technology has

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.960
really regenerated and revitalized letter
press printing.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.860
And that is still the same principle of relief
printing, printing from a raised service-like

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.560
type.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:07:00.490
But this material is a thin layer of metal
and on that is another layer of polymer material

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:09.110
that has a photo ground coating on the top,
and to make the plate digital type setting

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.389
or some other form of image that can be output
as a negative.

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:21.939
The negative and the polymer plate are sandwiched
together, it's exposed to light and where

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:26.919
the light hits the photo ground on the polymer
surface it hardens.

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:30.990
And then the polymer plate is washed in warm
water, it's a great thing because there is

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:34.889
no toxic photo chemicals, it's a pretty benign
process.

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:41.040
And then the softer polymer material just
rinses away and you are left with that relief

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:49.840
surface, so it's a very wonderful, easy technology
that means you don't have to set type and

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.599
put the type all back in the box.

00:07:54.599 --> 00:08:01.270
So it then locks up in the press, it sits
on a magnetic base so that thin layer of metal

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:07.069
on the back sits on a magnetic base and then
those two things together, the base and the

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:14.430
plate equal a measurement that is type high,
which is the universal height of type, metal

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:15.430
type.

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.039
And so that means anything you can make a
plate out of you can lock that up in the press

00:08:19.039 --> 00:08:20.219
and print from it.

00:08:20.219 --> 00:08:25.569
So a lot of small letter press shops have
come up because you don't have to have all

00:08:25.569 --> 00:08:29.340
the equipment and all the type and all of
that, you just need a press and access to

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:33.920
a plate maker and it's done something pretty
wonderful.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:43.600
But how I make images primarily is linoleum
block and similar to the polymer material,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:50.140
linoleum block is a thin layer of linoleum
mounted on wood and it's approximate type

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:51.140
high.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.570
I usually have to build up the back of it.

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:58.070
And linoleum is a natural material, this kind
is called battleship linoleum.

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:02.920
It's created out of powered cork and linseed
oil, it was developed by the military just

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:09.100
before World War II to use as flooring for
their battleships and submarines.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:14.950
And which, you know, it's impervious to water
and it's soft enough to stand on so your legs

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:19.790
don't get tired and it has a sort of a little
porous surface.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:27.090
It's not flat like metal or polymer and so
when it's printed it has a sort of stippled

00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:34.420
texture that I find really beautiful and you
can really identify linoleum from that look

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.770
once you know what it is.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:44.370
And the process of making them, the prints,
the blocks themselves, is I start with a drawing

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.780
and then, a pretty simple drawing like this
as you can see.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:54.580
And then you have to, I use drafting paper,
turn it over and trace it on the back because

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:58.870
when you are working in printing you have
to work in reverse.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:04.310
And then I put a sort of graphite crayon on
the back and taped that onto the block and

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:09.650
then trace through the drawing onto the block
and that leaves something that looks like

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.530
a pencil line on the block.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:16.940
And I do that for, one block for each color
in the print, cause press prints one color

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.070
at a time.

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:26.690
And so if the image has four colors then there
are four blocks and then once that drawing

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:33.850
has been transferred to the linoleum then
it's cut and carved and that's a process of

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:39.040
removing all the negative space in the print.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:45.560
So as you can see with this leaf the block
on the bottom, you can see the lines of the

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:52.161
gouges where the linoleum has been removed
so that only that part that I want to print

00:10:52.161 --> 00:10:53.750
is there.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:11:03.080
Here's an example of this violet image, the
image is made from four blocks and the first

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:11.740
one on the left is the dark green leaves of
the image so that was printed first.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:17.950
And then the second block is of the area under
the leaves, just the solid, and that's a lighter

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:24.540
green so that's coming through the lines that
are cut in the first image, the veins and

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:27.450
inside the stalks there.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:31.920
The third one is another line image of these,
sort of outlines and interior lines of the

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:38.710
violets and then the last one is the tint,
the purple tint color of the violets.

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.610
So those are printed one at a time.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:44.550
There is also a little bit of an orange that
you will see in the image that is the center

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:50.180
of the flowers that I just added by water
color, it's a little hard to cut those tiny

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.360
little spaces and get them in the right place.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:12:00.300
So that's the basic process , here's the finished
menu that that was made for, a New Years Eve

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.620
menu.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:08.611
So usually when I am making these menus that
have text I will print the image first and

00:12:08.611 --> 00:12:13.940
the last thing that happens is the type is
added at the end, a separate run.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:21.450
So, as I say, the organization of the book
is the menus are chronological and the first

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:25.850
ones that I made early on were really typographical.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:32.260
I didn't know how to do this linoleum work
at that time, so I was setting this by hand,

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:37.350
and metal type and using little type ornaments
and that sort of thing.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:43.650
And another aspect that is sort of fun about
this book is reading what's actually on the

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:44.650
menus.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:51.270
There, it's kind of a snapshot of the history
of Chez Panisse as well and really what was

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:55.120
being served when and in this case for how
much.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:13:01.190
It's pretty astonishing, homemade pastries
for seventy five cents.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:05.080
Lindsay Shere , who was the pastry chef, the
starting pastry chef at the restaurant, made

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:11.890
fantastic, fantastic desserts and you could
just go in and get wonderful little cappuccino

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:20.380
or a cup of coffee and a slice of her almond
tart and pay one dollar which is pretty amazing.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:26.380
When the restaurant first opened with their
four course meal, and they just became famous,

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:31.020
I don't know if you know about Chez Panisse
but they became famous for serving one prix

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.430
fixe dinner menu a night.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:37.690
So it was either four or sometimes on weekends
it would be five courses, but when they first

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:42.540
started it was four dollars and fifty cents
for a four course dinner in 1971.

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:48.940
Of course they were losing a lot of money
so [audience laughs] after about six months

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.870
I think it went up to six fifty or six twenty
five or something like that.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:57.160
But now it's far from that.

00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:03.610
So I didn't really start making too many menus
until after I stopped cooking.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:09.620
I would dabble in it a little bit and I did
acquire a press during that time but I didn't

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:12.580
really have time, I was too busy in the kitchen.

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:16.870
But then afterwards when I started working
on the books and I wanted to print more and

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:24.910
I wanted to add images to the type and so
I decided I maybe I would try to do learn

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:26.820
to do this linoleum work.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:35.080
So this is one of the first blocks I cut,
a single color and it's really pretty simple.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:41.990
But I was thrilled by it and I thought maybe
I can do this.

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:48.990
And the other way that I was making menus
at the time, was in collaboration with my

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:55.240
husband, Stephen Thomas, who is a print maker
and prints etchings and Intaglio printer.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:00.860
And so we would collaborate and I would do
a drawing on a copper plate that he would

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:07.540
etch or something else and then combine it
with type and so these are etchings.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:12.240
And when we were doing these, because it's
a really time consuming process printing etchings,

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:18.420
so it was usually a small number for maybe
that particular party, one table of four or

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:21.200
six or eight or something.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.420
Very small number.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:33.440
This menu on the left, the menu for the potato
king was for a friend of ours who had an absolute

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.530
obsession with potatoes and he always wanted
potatoes with every meal.

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:41.160
It wasn't a meal unless there was some kind
of a potato dish.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:48.850
So for his birthday we made him a menu that
had potatoes with every course and put together

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:54.360
quickly just this little menu in a couple
of days and Stephen printed it.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:59.560
The other was for a dinner for James Beard
who didn't often come to the restaurant but

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:05.570
he came this one spring and it was a time
we were just harvesting green garlic, the

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:08.350
young garlic that you only get right in the
spring.

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:11.680
At the time that was a really new thing, now
you see it in all the farmers markets but

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:18.420
that was kind of a big deal to have this young
green garlic so that's what decorated the

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.420
menu.

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:28.120
And Stephen and I did a number of New Years
menus together for a few years in a row and

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:34.420
we liked to focus on the celestial theme,
sort of the big picture.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:40.590
And took some inspiration from some photographs,
NASA photographs that were coming back of

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:45.180
the Earth from space for this one.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:53.990
Here's another etching, its a mezzotint actually
and this was an astronomical occurrence of

00:16:53.990 --> 00:17:00.120
a blue moon, the second full moon within on
calendar month.

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:07.199
And it was that night of the New Years Eve
dinner so we couldn't resist that.

00:17:07.199 --> 00:17:16.299
But then I started working on this linoleum
thing and I tried to get better at it doing,

00:17:16.299 --> 00:17:22.140
getting a little more ambitious and the images
start out very simple.

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:26.689
These are sort of just shapes with a little
line work in them.

00:17:26.689 --> 00:17:33.410
And often the imagery that I would do is,
I was working at the limitations of what I

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:35.309
could manage so they had to be simple.

00:17:35.309 --> 00:17:42.919
But sometimes they were inspired by literally
something on the menu that was an ingredient

00:17:42.919 --> 00:17:46.530
or something being served.

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:54.510
Or often times it would be something that
represented the season or the time or the

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:55.510
moment.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.240
This one is kind of both.

00:17:58.240 --> 00:18:03.779
And here is another sample of the kind of
menu I would do sometimes and often times

00:18:03.779 --> 00:18:08.840
if there was somebody special coming in, there
was two days notice that Elizabeth David or

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:15.720
Richard Olney or Julia Child or someone was
coming and Alice really wanted a special menu.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:23.029
So, in those cases, I would do something very
fast, just set the text in type and print

00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:26.110
that and then do hand decorations.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:33.080
A little drawing and in this case a water
color filling in, for just that small group

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:41.370
of people, that table of four or that table
of six.

00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:48.909
This was a special lunch for Richard Olney
again, he is no longer with us but he was

00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:56.210
very influential cookbook writer, an American,
an ex-pat who lived in France for most of

00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:05.350
his life and wrote about French food and wrote
for an American audience.

00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:12.549
He wrote about the Cuisine du Bonne Femmes,
which is just the ordinary wonderfully household

00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:18.620
cooking of French homemakers.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:24.049
And he elevated that and really broke it down
really fantastic books.

00:19:24.049 --> 00:19:31.020
So here, this was an important breakthrough
for me, this particular menu because the imagery

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:35.370
is really simple but I drew it from life.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:43.509
Hadn't been doing that and I got these leaves
and I wanted to somehow get this color and

00:19:43.509 --> 00:19:51.890
so I drew the leaves and figured out this
composition and then I had this kind of light

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:56.710
bulb go off and thought well maybe on my press
that has this ink plate that turns around

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.730
and spreads the ink, maybe I could disconnect
that.

00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:05.070
I disconnected the device that turned the
ink plate and then mixed different colors

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:11.070
and just spread them on the ink plate by hand
and then just let the rollers blend them a

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:17.799
little bit so that if you picture this menu
turned on its side so that the block is ninety

00:20:17.799 --> 00:20:24.100
degrees you can see stripes of color; red,
yellow, orange and then more yellow.

00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:29.510
And so with one pass through the press, all
these different colors on the ink plate, it

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:31.650
was like, wow this could work.

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:37.370
And it's a little rough, you can see where
those lines aren't there and they are not

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:44.990
blending perfectly, but it was really an exciting
moment and I thought this, this could really

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.990
lead to something.

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:51.210
I could play with this.

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:58.029
So then I decided I need to get better at
this drawing thing and I have always been

00:20:58.029 --> 00:21:05.509
very influenced by both typographically and
with images and visually by older books.

00:21:05.509 --> 00:21:10.149
And I really, really loved old botanics and
herbals.

00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:18.580
This is an image from John Gerarde's Herbal
printed in 1633 which was the height of a

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:24.029
scientific text at the time of identifying
plants and what their properties were and,

00:21:24.029 --> 00:21:26.389
um, huge, big book.

00:21:26.389 --> 00:21:32.910
And these are wood cuts, so single color cut
from wood, same process as linoleum only wood

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:34.860
instead of linoleum.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:40.840
So I used to pore over these and look at these
and think, try and figure out how to do it.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.470
Maybe I could do something like that or I
would do very simplified versions of them.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:53.320
And so I started trying to do that sort of
thing of this, like the garlic, bunch of garlic

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.320
here.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:59.990
Which again I was starting to draw from life
because that's what I wanted to see on the

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.990
menus.

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:05.889
I couldn't find something directly to sort
of immolate or copy so I was just trying to

00:22:05.889 --> 00:22:09.090
use the style but trying to do that.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:17.500
And like this, you can see the direct influence
of those Herbal wood cuts.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:23.700
But I wanted also to add color to them so
then I would do the line work in black and

00:22:23.700 --> 00:22:27.750
then cut a block and add the screen, to get
a tint.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:35.830
The purple in that turnip is a little handwork
that was put on with water color.

00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:42.740
The other source of imagery that I really,
really loved is Japanese woodblock prints

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.980
and that whole tradition.

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:53.799
This print was made by Utamoro in a book called
Song of the Garden that combined his images

00:22:53.799 --> 00:23:04.179
with the text of Japanese poets, very popular
book at the time It was printed in 1788.

00:23:04.179 --> 00:23:10.970
And I loved the composition of these are so
lyrical and beautiful where, and the combination

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:15.350
of the text with the image and the space in
there.

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:21.370
And I was also looking at like these leaves
which had the line and the color and so graceful

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:26.809
and trying to think how can I sort of incorporate
that in that too.

00:23:26.809 --> 00:23:34.330
So I started immolating that and here is an
image made about that time.

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:40.990
This was actually a card that folded in the
middle, so it had a front and a back, but

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:47.299
really conceived of as one image in that Japanese
woodblock style.

00:23:47.299 --> 00:23:59.429
[pause] Here's another very simple bu, for
me, kind of markers of the time because I

00:23:59.429 --> 00:24:06.220
was breaking these into different colors and
being able to put them together and without

00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:12.010
necessarily the black line, but composing
an image of these separate blocks just with

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:13.010
color.

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:22.490
And then using the space like the beautiful
spaces in those Japanese prints.

00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:27.539
And this is not anything literal about the
menu, this is flowering quince.

00:24:27.539 --> 00:24:35.309
But again it's about the season, about just
a moment, here's where we are right now.

00:24:35.309 --> 00:24:42.450
Another homage to Japan with the fade at the
top.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:46.570
One of the things that has always been very
interesting in the studio and satisfying is

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:54.570
to keep pushing the limits of the medium and
keep pushing the limits of the press itself.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:59.700
What can I do of this particular machine with
these particular materials?

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:10.159
And how one discovery leads to another and
the emphasis to try something new.

00:25:10.159 --> 00:25:16.230
So I had been making some of these special
menus for the downstairs restaurant and Alice

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:20.429
really wanted to have something every night
in there.

00:25:20.429 --> 00:25:26.010
Which was very difficult to accomplish, especially
with the changing menu every night, and then

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:32.679
it was always right until the last hour really
that that menu was getting determined.

00:25:32.679 --> 00:25:40.889
So I worked out a system where using an 8-1/2
x 11 sheet I could print on one half of it

00:25:40.889 --> 00:25:50.990
and then they could set the menu for the evening's
dinner on the computer, output that and then

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:55.750
put these in the copy machine and photocopy
that onto the interior and then fold it and

00:25:55.750 --> 00:26:02.450
then there would be this combination of up
to date menu but something pretty and printed.

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:10.490
So I started making these as seasonal imagery
and printed them for about a year and a half

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:14.730
or so, you know like two or three thousand
at a go.

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:22.429
But which was just not sustainable at all
so eventually I designed something that could

00:26:22.429 --> 00:26:31.159
be printed offset and they could print multiple
thousands and that would do for awhile.

00:26:31.159 --> 00:26:38.269
[pause]
Nowadays they still use that same system and

00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:43.919
they reproduce images from illustrations I
made for some of the cookbooks of fruit and

00:26:43.919 --> 00:26:47.600
vegetable illustrations.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:55.409
So about the time, about the time this menu
was made I was working on a book called Chez

00:26:55.409 --> 00:27:01.370
Panisse Vegetables where I really, this is
where the sort of drawing really had to get

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:02.919
better.

00:27:02.919 --> 00:27:09.899
And my task was to very specifically draw
certain vegetables, fifty different ones and

00:27:09.899 --> 00:27:11.850
made prints of these.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:18.440
And so I really started drawing from life,
going to the garden or brining material into

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:26.440
my studio and I didn't have, that was so consuming
I couldn't really spend too much time making

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.440
the menu.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:32.200
So some of the images I made for that I incorporated
and just said "I can do a menu if it's got

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.309
this on it."

00:27:33.309 --> 00:27:39.610
But these are images that were made for that
book actually.

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:45.409
But I found that just by doing it more and
doing more and doing it more I did get better

00:27:45.409 --> 00:27:48.769
at it.

00:27:48.769 --> 00:27:55.610
Here's another example of that split fountain
so-called technique of the multiple colors

00:27:55.610 --> 00:28:07.009
in one pass on the ink plate with the leaves
of this image.

00:28:07.009 --> 00:28:15.330
These are, these two were for the then First
Lady Hillary Clinton and trying not to be

00:28:15.330 --> 00:28:20.769
intimidated by the First Lady I went in just
the absolute opposite way and went very, very

00:28:20.769 --> 00:28:21.769
simple.

00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:30.860
The one on the left was a lunch and they were
trying to serve as many, gather as many ingredients

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:37.640
as they could from edible school yard in Berkley
to impress upon the First Lady that the beautiful

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.999
food that could come from these school garden
projects.

00:28:41.999 --> 00:28:53.049
[ pause ] This is a New Year's Eve menu, those
are always celebrated in a some kind of gala

00:28:53.049 --> 00:29:03.000
way at the restaurant and extra effort was
put into those menus, the menus for that event

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.410
and others, too.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:11.350
They are really souvenirs and people take
them home and it's a way to remember something

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:17.129
as fleeting as a wonderful dinner, it's quite
a reminder and the experience of being there

00:29:17.129 --> 00:29:19.980
at the restaurant.

00:29:19.980 --> 00:29:29.149
Here's some more Japanese influence of space
and text and image combination.

00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:33.690
These are white dogwoods.

00:29:33.690 --> 00:29:42.720
Carrie Glenn was the florist at the restaurant
for decades and she was very, very extraordinary

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.220
woman.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:53.440
She made these amazing floral arrangements
and this was her goodbye party.

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:59.899
Dinner with Mikhail Baryshnikov.

00:29:59.899 --> 00:30:09.450
[pause] Here again is that use of that multiple
color technique and this time instead of one

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:15.970
block it's three blocks, so you can--,.

00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:19.891
It then becomes more interesting where you
can put them right next to each other.

00:30:19.891 --> 00:30:25.249
And you will see in some areas where the leaves
overlap there is a little line, well that

00:30:25.249 --> 00:30:32.090
is the double ink of that that instead of
cutting a line, like a drawn line, it's just

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:37.720
where they overprint they make their own line
and it helps to separate one leaf from another,

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:42.990
it's kind of a nice way of subtly doing that.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:51.659
This was a dinner for his Royal Highness,
the Prince of Wales, who visited the Bay Area

00:30:51.659 --> 00:31:00.739
and he's very involved in Brittan in the organic
food movement there, and schools, and school

00:31:00.739 --> 00:31:06.720
gardens and organic farming in general in
England, it's pretty great.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:10.960
So when he came to the United States to visit
he wanted to come to the Bay Area because

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:16.779
there is such a great movement here and he
wanted to visit the Edible School Yard which

00:31:16.779 --> 00:31:17.779
they did.

00:31:17.779 --> 00:31:20.269
It's very exciting.

00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:26.799
And then there was this big dinner for the
both of them.

00:31:26.799 --> 00:31:33.070
This is direct influence from Japanese bird
and flower prints.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:39.399
This was made for the wedding of a very close
friend, he and his partner were married just

00:31:39.399 --> 00:31:48.450
before Proposition 8 passed on the ballet
so they were legally married in California.

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:54.789
And the two birds on the branch, they are
red-winged black birds and that, black birds

00:31:54.789 --> 00:32:02.149
the only the males have the color on their
wings, the females you know are just all one

00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:03.149
color.

00:32:03.149 --> 00:32:09.249
So on this branch are two male birds.

00:32:09.249 --> 00:32:20.029
And here's another wedding, this one has quite
a bit of detail with rosemary flowers and

00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:23.759
this is a combination of printing and then
I went in and I filled in the color and then

00:32:23.759 --> 00:32:27.899
the little tiny detail of those flowers by
hand.

00:32:27.899 --> 00:32:34.159
So this is really quite enjoyable to do that
kind of handwork actually and you can do things

00:32:34.159 --> 00:32:42.340
that are otherwise too subtle to do it on
the press.

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:49.480
Another wedding menu that Chez Panisse did
on a dinner on an island, the wedding was

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.639
on the beach.

00:32:51.639 --> 00:33:01.610
So I wanted somehow to get sand on the menu
itself and, through some trial and error,

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:08.750
I figured out that if I put some vermiculite
in a little Cuisinart and then broke it up

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:13.749
and then put that on the wet ink when it came
out of the press it would stick to the ink

00:33:13.749 --> 00:33:22.840
and then actually made something that looks
very much like sand.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:30.499
And that is the summary, so thank you I would
be happy to answer any questions if you have

00:33:30.499 --> 00:33:34.879
any to talk about that.

00:33:34.879 --> 00:33:39.889
[applause]
&gt;&gt; Male #1: What was the main influence of

00:33:39.889 --> 00:33:43.860
your choice of that particular press and mechanism?

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.570
Was it it's availability or did you seek it
out?

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:52.150
&gt;&gt; Patricia: Well, um, that's actually the
press I first learned to print on when I was

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:56.370
in David Goines' shop.

00:33:56.370 --> 00:34:04.639
Someone he, he prints on an offset press but
someone had given him this press and I was

00:34:04.639 --> 00:34:12.380
one of a couple of the students of his and
so an older friend of his, a journeyman printer,

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:17.560
came and taught us how to operate this press
and how to print.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:21.909
And I just fell in love with it.

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:25.840
And I've operated a few other presses but
I really loved that one.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:30.510
I loved the size of it and the simplicity
of it.

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:34.800
These presses are like vintage cars where
you could open the hood and you could still

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.530
how the whole thing works.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:44.511
It's sort of the opposite of a computer but
it has, it has a very graceful, wonderful

00:34:44.511 --> 00:34:48.440
mechanism that kind of fits the body.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:58.401
It's not a huge big thing but it's good and
solid and very capable and, um, so I, when

00:34:58.401 --> 00:35:04.760
I decided I wanted a press I started looking
around and I found one at a used equipment,

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.940
printing equipment place and there was that
same press.

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.339
I thought, well that's for me.

00:35:09.339 --> 00:35:15.070
&gt;&gt; Female #1: Have you ever had any typos?

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:19.590
&gt;&gt; Patricia: [giggles]I can't even count how
many typos.

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:20.590
Yeah.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:21.900
[laughs] happens all the time.

00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:26.820
&gt;&gt; Female #1 : So when you do is it like "Oh
well" or do you have to redo everything?

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.800
&gt;&gt; Patricia: If you catch it in time, you
can change it.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:33.780
But after it's printed it's "Oh well".

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:41.740
But I always try and employ the services of
a friend who is a good proofreader.

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.560
You have to have somebody else look at it.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:49.570
You just, because when you are setting, once
you start printing or once you set it, you

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:57.200
sort of stop seeing it as information, you
see it as shape and where it is on the page.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:03.800
Proofreaders are a special group of people
to be able to catch that and I am really prone

00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.890
to typos.

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:06.991
Something I have to watch out for.

00:36:06.991 --> 00:36:07.991
&gt;&gt; Female #2: Hi.

00:36:07.991 --> 00:36:12.840
For your menus that aren't for special events,
what is the lifetime of the menu?

00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:13.840
How many times can you repeat them?

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:16.720
&gt;&gt; Patricia: I'm sorry I didn't hear the question
&gt;&gt; Female #2: What's the lifetime of a menu?

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:23.050
So how many times can you give it to like
a new customer before it gets bad or you know?

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:25.760
&gt;&gt; Patricia: You just use it once, they just
use them once.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:26.760
&gt;&gt; Female #2: Oh, you just use them once?

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.760
Do they get to take it home?

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:28.760
&gt;&gt; Patricia: Yes, absolutely they get to take
them home.

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.050
&gt;&gt; Female #2: Oh great, ok.

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:32.000
&gt;&gt; Patricia: So that's what I mean.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.020
The restaurant doesn't advertise, they have
never advertised, they have never done anything

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:43.790
like that and from very early on Alice knew
about good printing, knew about fine printing

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:45.190
and she always loved that.

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:48.510
So that is something she wanted as part of
the restaurant.

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:55.890
So like in the very early days she would get
local printers, and in the Bay Area there

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:58.410
has always been a real printing community
in the Bay Area.

00:36:58.410 --> 00:37:01.250
A lot of letter press printers, there still
are.

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:08.490
She would get these printers to make a special
menu or a week of menus or something like

00:37:08.490 --> 00:37:11.880
that, very cleverly, in exchange for food
and wine.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:17.240
[audience laughs] So they were so ready to
do this and then there were always these printers

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:23.030
hanging around late night dinners, a whole
table of printers, drinking and drinking.

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:31.380
So it just became really a part of the signature,
the look and the style and the aesthetic of

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:32.380
the restaurant.

00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:39.790
But the ones that they use now they have a,
just kind of an inventory of maybe twenty

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:42.200
images on that 8-1/2 x 11 sheet.

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:50.070
So then they can select for that night what
seems appropriate for that menu or this season

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:52.120
or that time of year.

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.109
They print out one for every dinner.

00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:59.030
&gt;&gt; Female #2: Sorry, to follow up; what percentage
of people do you think bring home the menus

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:00.720
as opposed to leaving them there?

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:05.410
&gt;&gt; Patricia: Um, I would say on a nightly
basis maybe half.

00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:10.820
Of the special menus, you know that hand printed
menus, people catch on to that and they take

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:11.820
them home.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:18.810
One of the things about letter press, if you
are familiar with it, is it has this very

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:21.440
tactile handmade quality.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:26.610
You may not know anything about the process
or you may not be familiar with letter press

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:31.420
really, but when you hold it you know something
has happened.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:37.640
This is, it's handmade and you can tell and
it communicates something.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.250
And it's intimate, it's personal.

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:47.150
That's one of the things I love about the
medium is it's called letter press because

00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:54.600
it punches the impression into the paper so
it has a kind of textural, sculptural aspect.

00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:58.940
There are shadows where the letter forms are
and it's quite beautiful.

00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.300
I brought some for you guys to see after its--.

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:09.660
[pause]
&gt;&gt; Male #2 : So on the multi block projects,

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:12.830
how do you keep the registration correct?

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:16.750
&gt;&gt; Patricia: Yeah it is tricky.

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:18.220
I work very, very methodically.

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:23.310
I mean printing is a methodical process, it's
not spontaneous.

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:29.770
You have a plan and you work step by step
and so you have methods of working.

00:39:29.770 --> 00:39:36.150
But I start with that drawing you saw and
when I put it on the block and I trace over

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:44.210
the drawing, that part of the drawing for
that part of the image, I'm very faithful

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:45.710
to that line.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:51.420
So then the line is on the block and then
when I am cutting again I am very faithful

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:56.790
to that line that is the real line, not near
it, not next to it, it's the line.

00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:03.340
And then if you get everything sort of on
the blocks in the right place, then you have

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:05.810
the potential for registering it on the press.

00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:14.890
Then it's a matter of printing in a likewise
methodical way, but it's just being very careful

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:17.370
at every stage.

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:21.110
And you know, my opinion, there are lots of
ways to go about this.

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:27.420
Many kinds of printing it's not such a tight
registration, it's looser and colors overlap

00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:33.130
and it's a little more impressionistic looking.

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:40.740
But my particular style, my particular aesthetic
is for really close registration.

00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:48.650
I always kind of go back to early botanicals
and how beautiful they are, those often were

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:55.280
engraved or etched or printed in one color
and hand colored.

00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:59.250
A lot of the really ones you might be familiar
with.

00:40:59.250 --> 00:41:02.180
But I am trying to do that on the press, I
am trying to kind of figure out a way.

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:05.260
So it's really just working very carefully.

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:12.700
&gt;&gt; Female #3: Do you have a favorite menu
or a favorite story from the menus in your

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:13.700
book?

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:19.120
&gt;&gt; Patricia: Um, it would be hard to pick,
it would be hard to pick one.

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:24.740
The one I showed you with the leaves where
there light bulb went off about the multi-colors,

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:33.800
that one is a favorite for me because it opened
my mind about what I could do on my press.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:43.150
And I think there is a principle at work there
which is, that partly comes from learning

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:49.470
about cooking at Chez Panisse cause when the
restaurant first started, we really didn't

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:51.560
know what we were doing.

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:58.130
There was a desire to achieve something and
cook fabulous food but most of us were not

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:00.640
trained.

00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:04.980
And so Alice would make up these menus and
put dishes on the menus that we had never

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.910
cooked before.

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:13.240
And there was one chef who came to work and
stayed for a long time, Jean Pierre Moulle,

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:18.630
he was classically trained and he was French
and he could like bring some hardcore information

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:20.030
and technique into the kitchen.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:25.220
But we would just put things on the menu and
then try it.

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:31.080
And one thing we figured out right away, and
you, because it's one menu, one night, you

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:36.500
are not duplicating the same thing over and
over again, you are always, there is always

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.530
the next night and new things.

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:46.430
But if it didn't work, if we were unsatisfied
with that dish, the thing is you were just

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:49.750
like let's put some version of that one the
menu next week.

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:56.330
And we would do it again, and we would do
it again until we got it and then we had that

00:42:56.330 --> 00:43:00.520
technique or we had that dish in the repertoire.

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:05.820
Same thing with something that worked fabulously
well, we would do it again soon so that we

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:07.830
wouldn't forget.

00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:16.860
Because when things are changing so often
it is hard to remember, you know you're just

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:19.870
moving all the time.

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:28.010
So that same way of, that same approach I
took into the print studio when I stopped

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:33.520
working in the kitchen, which is go for what
you want to see.

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:38.540
I would try it and sometimes it would work
and sometimes it wasn't but then I would try

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:39.960
it again, try it again.

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:47.750
And eventually you would kind of get there,
so for me some of the memorable menus are

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:52.140
the ones where I really, I really discovered
something.

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:57.190
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Thanks for coming, I love your
work.

00:43:57.190 --> 00:44:01.120
I have a mimeograph machine, I am terrible
at using it.

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:06.440
But I have a series of realizations like,
oh it matters what ink you use, oh it matters

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:09.230
what paper you use, but I missed the beginning
of your talk.

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:15.710
I was curious about how far down the rabbit
hole do you go with the particular paper?

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:18.940
I know people who, like, they are not happy
with what's available so they try to make

00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:19.940
their own.

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:23.740
I was just curious like do you enjoy that
part of it and how far do you go to get it

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:24.750
just to your specifications?

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:27.410
&gt;&gt; Patricia: That's a good question.

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:29.570
Very, very far down the rabbit hole.

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:35.800
[audience laughs lightly] Another tremendous
pleasure in printing and I thinks it's one

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:40.700
of the things that really hooks people, especially
letter press printers, is paper.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:46.100
A paper is just beautiful, beautiful stuff,
quality papers.

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:51.010
And they all print differently, they all feel
different, they have slightly different textures

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:52.010
and colors.

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:58.380
So you have to make adjustments for all of
that and you know when I would be conceiving

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:06.751
of a menu, making a plan, part of that is
what paper, what color is the paper, what's

00:45:06.751 --> 00:45:07.751
it's going to do in the press.

00:45:07.751 --> 00:45:14.770
And because not all papers are suitable for
block printing or letter press printing, that

00:45:14.770 --> 00:45:17.120
kind of limits certain things.

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:23.320
But fortunately most fine papers are really,
really good.

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:34.780
I don't make paper, but you know we have done
all kinds of things like print an image and

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:36.470
then make a fan out of it.

00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:41.600
Cut it and glue it to sticks in order to get
a printed fan, and then you just, there are

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:46.220
all kinds of things possible.

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:53.280
You build up your knowledge of materials and
inks and mixing colors and what happens when

00:45:53.280 --> 00:46:00.950
you put one color on top of another and what
are you likely to get and all of that.

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:07.270
It's a cycle, it's trial and error, basically
no rules, you just keep, you do it until you

00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:08.280
get what you want.

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:10.930
Yeah, yeah, but that's the fun of it.

00:46:10.930 --> 00:46:16.210
That's what I was saying, that discovery is,
um, you start in one place and you just keep

00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:21.920
adding to that and you get into all kinds
of new places.

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:31.680
[pause] Anyone else?

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:32.770
Thank you, thank you very much.

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:34.850
&gt;&gt; Male Announcer: Ok, can we get one more
round of applause for Patricia.
