DAN FELD: Hi.

00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.636
We're here live at the
Founder World Event at Pier 27

00:00:04.636 --> 00:00:05.548
in San Francisco.

00:00:05.548 --> 00:00:09.750
With me is Purnima Kochikar,
the Director of App

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.050
and Games Business
Development at Google Play.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:12.700
Hi, Purnima.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.097
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Hello.

00:00:13.097 --> 00:00:14.290
Very nice to see you.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.781
DAN FELD: Would
you like to tell us

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:17.780
a little bit about your
background and, perhaps,

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.966
how did you get to Google?

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:22.090
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Well, I
started like most Indians

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.450
as a software engineer.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.600
So I think I started
as a developer.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.310
I've always been
passionate about how

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.430
technology changes lives.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.890
So just before Google, I was
at Nokia managing the developer

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:33.850
network.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.495
And candidly, Google
found me on Google.

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:38.780
DAN FELD: And when was that?

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.446
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: It
was three years ago

00:00:40.446 --> 00:00:42.110
when Play was just founded.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.370
It was Android
Marketplace before that.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.150
And so at the launch of
Play, Jamie Rosenberg,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.100
who heads all of
Play, reached out.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.872
And the rest is history.

00:00:50.872 --> 00:00:52.080
DAN FELD: That's fascinating.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.475
So you got the
privilege actually

00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:58.750
to work with Google Play
from the very beginning

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.164
and to build the business
from its foundation.

00:01:01.164 --> 00:01:02.080
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Yes.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.579
I can't think of a more
exciting place to be.

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:08.930
When I joined, it was like a
team of less than five people.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.450
And now we have a
global team supporting

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.955
developers in big and small
places around the world.

00:01:14.955 --> 00:01:17.230
DAN FELD: So speaking
about developers,

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.777
I meet developers almost
every day just like you.

00:01:19.777 --> 00:01:21.610
We are both working in
different capacities,

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.290
but in the field trying
to work with developers

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.560
and have developers.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.660
Many of them are
looking to monetize.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.910
And they're looking to speak and
to get advice and to, perhaps,

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.638
get features on Google Play.

00:01:33.638 --> 00:01:36.330
So would you have
any guidance how

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.905
to build it for success and to
the right way of monetization?

00:01:40.905 --> 00:01:42.280
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR:
No, absolutely.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.060
So what we find is that the
people who monetize the best

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.910
are the ones who don't
think about monetization.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.750
They spend a lot of time
really thinking about the user

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.540
and creating value for
the user and actually

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.180
being very, very careful
about when they monetize.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.660
So I think that's number one.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.160
So I always tell people,
think about your user,

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.510
think about your value
proposition to the user

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.180
and think about the one single
engagement metric around which

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.020
you can build your company.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.920
So for example, if you want
people to come back and play

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.750
multiple sessions,
then think about how

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.210
to have them come
back lots of times.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.700
If you want people to spend
a lot of time in one session,

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.480
then you do different things.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.200
So messaging apps,
lots of small sessions.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.500
Media apps, perhaps
longer sessions and so on.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.690
So that's something
we find constantly.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.080
Casual games, lots
of small sessions.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.900
RPG games, large
sessions, so you

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.550
have to have a bigger storyline,
larger characters, and so on.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.126
So quality matters.

00:02:44.126 --> 00:02:45.750
I would encourage
people to go and look

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.212
at the Secrets of App
Success on Google Play.

00:02:48.212 --> 00:02:50.045
I think it's being given
out to the founders

00:02:50.045 --> 00:02:53.190
here today, which tells you
all the different ways you can

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.565
improve the quality of your
app, acquire and retain

00:02:55.565 --> 00:02:57.770
good users, et cetera.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.580
Really, really think about
and listen to your users.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.890
Think about reviews.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.950
What the people are saying, and
how you can respond to that.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.730
And we are typically
looking at those signals.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.340
We're looking at, is
this a high quality app?

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.260
Are users loving it?

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.000
What does the ratings say?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.680
Is there enough
innovation in the app

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.020
for that particular category?

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:19.040
Or is that just a me-too app?

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.381
And finally, and most
importantly, is it timed right?

00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:23.880
Right?

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.755
Because sometimes you
might launch something,

00:03:25.755 --> 00:03:28.320
and it's drowned in the
noise of something else.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.520
And so, yeah.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.200
I mean, we discover great
hidden gems constantly.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.590
And we're always looking
for the next innovator.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.775
DAN FELD: So quality
matters, but timing is not

00:03:38.775 --> 00:03:39.990
less important.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.095
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Exactly.

00:03:41.095 --> 00:03:43.550
DAN FELD: Would you
differ or perhaps

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.774
divert your advice between
early-stage and more mature

00:03:47.774 --> 00:03:49.082
companies, startups?

00:03:49.082 --> 00:03:50.040
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Yeah.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.220
I mean, the early-stage
guys I think

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.620
are still trying to
find their bearing.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.230
I would highly recommend--
and this is true for mature

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.430
as well, but for
early-stage especially--

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.960
to build a very trusted
community of alpha and beta

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.750
testers so that
they can have people

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.187
who can amplify their words.

00:04:09.187 --> 00:04:11.270
Because then people will
go out and talk about it.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.770
So building a community of
people who care about it

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.950
I think matters even
more in early-stage.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.959
With the mature guys-- and
when it is a mature company,

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.760
metrics matter.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.354
Are they growing
at the right clip?

00:04:26.354 --> 00:04:28.770
When you have one install and
you get to a second install,

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.720
you still have
100% growth, right?

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.790
So as you get bigger, is
the growth continuing?

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.640
Are the installs happening?

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.440
How does the uninstall look?

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.890
Are people still
actively using the app?

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.440
It becomes much
more quantitative

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.690
about how they should
think about their business.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.270
DAN FELD: I know
that you just came

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.030
from upstairs giving a keynote.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.230
What did you discuss?

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.026
And what to were the reactions?

00:04:54.026 --> 00:04:56.400
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Well, I hope
the reaction was positive.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.300
What we discussed is the amazing
ability for founders today

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.400
to build global businesses
on platforms like Android.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.940
That you can be two guys
sitting in San Francisco

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:14.210
or in Cameroon, but you have the
world at your fingertips, which

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.820
I think was not true
even 10, 15 years ago.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.820
When people decided that
they were going global,

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.770
they had new management
teams come in, et cetera.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.280
So it is fascinating that
two guys sitting anywhere

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.710
could reach the world.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.330
And I gave some tips about when
you think about this big world,

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:33.590
there's huge opportunity.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.600
But you also have to think
very locally to go global.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.540
So that was the crux
of the conversation.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:42.140
DAN FELD: I think
it's a key point.

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.910
Go locally, even if you know
that you want to go globally.

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.150
I think it's very
important advice.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.921
Finally, what was your
impression from Founder World,

00:05:51.921 --> 00:05:53.670
both in terms of the
audience, and perhaps

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:54.510
the activities here?

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.440
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Well, the
excitement is totally palpable.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.910
It always reminds me
why I do what I do.

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:02.480
Because being around
people who are constantly

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.340
thinking about
changing the world

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.630
is highly infectious
and highly energizing.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.269
So I do want to thank
you and your team

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:12.560
for putting this together
and giving me the opportunity

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.337
to be here.

00:06:13.337 --> 00:06:15.420
DAN FELD: Thank you very
much for taking the time.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.520
I know that you are very busy.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.890
PURNIMA KOCHIKAR: Well,
thanks for having me.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:18.790
It was really fun.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.039
DAN FELD: Thank you very much.

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:23.370
And thank you for watching
live from Founder World.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.070
See you at the next segment.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.520
