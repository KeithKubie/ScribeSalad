00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.940
And the answer here, I think, is clearly no because a real computer, of course,

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.530
has finite memory, but think about your machines.

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:11.250
So let's say you have an older computer like me--so you have 1 gigabyte of memory.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.590
One gigabyte of memory is approximately 1 billion bytes or 8 billion bits.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:27.870
Now, how many different snapshots can you have with 8 billion bits--that is 2⁸⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰ snapshots.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.280
You wouldn't find a fraction of that as atoms in the universe.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.640
The argument is correct in theory, but it does not have any practical relevance--almost like

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.530
the halting problem, which I will soon show you also has actually very little practical relevance,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.750
but for this counter argument, it's basically the same.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.820
For real computer, I think you can consider the memory to be practically infinite.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.830
So this algorithm here just isn't going to cut it unless by real computer,

00:00:53.830 --> 99:59:59.000
you mean a very, very, very simple one.
