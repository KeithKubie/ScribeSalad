00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
Hi, I’m Thomas Frank, this is Crash Course
Study Skills.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.520
Benjamin Franklin once took a few seconds out of
his busy schedule of being a god of lightning to remark,

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.620
“By failing to prepare,
you are preparing to fail.”

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.440
This is doubly true when it comes to preparing
for your exams.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.020
So today we’re going to guide you through the
process of creating a study schedule, reviewing
effectively so that you master the material,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.760
and doing it all without cracking
under the pressure, quitting school,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.640
and building a career as an internet personality
who tells people how to do well in school despite
never being able to complete it yourself.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.320
As we’ve discussed already in this series,
learning takes time.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.760
Encoding new information into solid memories is
a physical process that doesn’t happen overnight,

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.700
and it requires multiple exposures
or recollections which need to be spaced out.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.960
But, as we’ve also discussed, your brain
isn’t built to make long-term focused decisions.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.760
It’s hard-wired to care a lot more about now than
later, which is why some of you are heavily considering
booting up Overwatch after this video ends

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.960
instead of finishing that math assignment
that’s due tomorrow.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.880
What this all means is that the structure
of the stuff sitting up in your cranium isn’t
up to the task of preparing for a test –

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.720
so you need to build external structures
to help it out.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.580
And, arguably, the most important one is a
study schedule.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.040
I recommend building your study schedule directly into
the calendar you’re already using for everything else,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.860
as it’s crucial to figure out how you’re going to
balance your time between studying and finishing all
the assignments and homework that lead up to the test.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.960
The first step to doing this is to figure
out the exact dates and times of your exams,
and then to add them to your calendar.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.560
In my Google Calendar, I actually have a specific
calendar that’s colored differently from all other events,
and that lets me see those dates and times at a glance.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.480
I’d also make sure to include the location for any exam that’s being held somewhere other than that class’s normal room – which happened pretty often for me in college.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.760
Once those dates are safely stored in your calendar,
work backwards and schedule study sessions during the
3 or 4 weeks leading up to your exams if they’re finals.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.759
If it’s a smaller exam, two weeks will probably
do.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.380
If you’ve got a lot of homework or group projects,
try to schedule time to work on those as well.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.520
When it comes time to actually sit down and
study, try to replicate the test conditions as
much as you possibly can.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:06.860
Memory is very context-based, so if you can review the material under conditions that are similar to those of the test, recalling it will be much easier when you’re actually taking it.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.220
So, how do you do this?

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.440
Well, first try to get as much information
about the test as possible.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.060
Ask your teacher – or look at the syllabus
– to find out what material will be covered,

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.860
whether or not the test will be comprehensive,
how many questions there will be, and how long
you’ll have to answer them.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.360
You’ll also want to know what types of questions
you’ll be up against – will they be multiple choice,
true/false, short answer, or essay?

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.980
Lastly, don’t forget to ask about what materials
will be allowed, such as scratch paper or calculators.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.500
Once you have all those details locked down,
the next step is to try to get your hands on practice
tests, or tests from previous semesters.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.580
You can ask your teacher if they have any that
they’re willing to give out as review material,

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.760
and if you’re in college, theremight be a fraternity,
or sorority, or some other student organization that
keeps a test bank you can dig through.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.860
There’s also an online test bank at Koofers.com
that contains old tests from lots of universities,
so that’s worth a look as well.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.060
Now that you’ve gathered all of your resources,
it’s time to study.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.860
But where should you do it?

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.220
While most of your studying will probably
happen in your established study space,

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:06.080
you should also try to do at least one or two sessions
in the actual classroom you’ll be tested in – or at least
some other classroom with a similar look and feel.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.060
As I mentioned earlier, memory is context-dependent.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.680
Our brains are better able to recall things they’ve
learned when we’re in a similar context to the one in
which we originally learned or reviewed the material.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.060
In fact, one study published in 1975 demonstrated
how subjects who learned lists of vocabulary words
underwater in scuba diving gear

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.480
were much more easily able to recall those
words when they went back underwater again,
as opposed to when they were on dry land.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.000
Don’t stop at the location, though.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.340
Also spend some time studying under the same
constraints that you’ll have during the test.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:39.330
Set a timer to simulate the test’s time limit, and quiz yourself without having access to your textbook, notes, or any other materials that you won’t have during the test.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.500
And notice that I said “quiz yourself”
here.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.660
The best way to study for a test is to do
it actively and to focus on recall –

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.560
to force yourself to actually pull facts and answers
up from the depths of your memory banks.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.500
Now, at this point you might be
thinking to yourself,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.340
“Tom, this all sounds good, and the fact
that you’re wearing one of Hank Green’s shirts
makes you a lot more trustworthy

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.220
BUT how am I supposed to quiz myself in
the first place – especially if my teacher didn’t
give me any practice tests?”

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.079
Well, you make your own quizzes, of course.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.800
Now, if your teacher gave you a study guide,
then that’s going to be your #1 resource for
creating these quizzes.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.180
Just take every concept listed on the guide
and convert it into a question.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.170
If you don’t happen to have one of those,
then do the same thing with your lecture notes.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.920
Look through them and create questions out of
headings, main concepts, and even case studies.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.500
Now, when you’re forming your questions,
in general you’re going to want to emulate
the test as much as possible.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.680
However, there are a few types of questions
that lend themselves perfectly to certain formats.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.840
For example, facts and vocabulary terms are
great candidates for flash cards.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.380
Studying flash cards is another form of
quizzing yourself, and they have one great benefit –
you can study them from both sides.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:45.340
If you’re studying for a chemistry exam, one card
can ask you what the chemical symbol for Neon is,
and if you flip it over, it can also make sure you
know what Ne represents.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.740
This ensures that your brain can make the
connection no matter where it starts.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.640
And when it comes to subjects like math or
physics, where your questions will usually
take the form of equations or problems,

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.180
you want to spend the majority of your study
time actually working through those problems.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.500
Spend a little bit of time familiarizing
yourself with formulas and concepts, sure,

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.900
but spend way more time practicing and making sure
you can actually perform the operations yourself.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.420
Now, as you spend time actively solving
these problems, you’re inevitably gonna run into
things you don’t know how to solve.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.560
When you do, it’s important to know when
to ask your teacher for help – and how to
do it correctly.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.760
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:24.250
Dale Corson, the 8th dean of Cornell University and
a professor of chemistry, offered some advice to his
students for how to effectively ask for help.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.880
Before going up to the professor, he said,
ask yourself: What is it – exactly – that
I don’t understand?

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.520
This obvious-sounding piece of advice is worth
stating plainly because, as Corson puts it,

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.780
many students would come up and say – with
a general sweep of the hand – “I don’t get this.”

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.720
The moment they encountered a tough spot,
they’d disengage and let their brain essentially give up.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.900
Don’t do this.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.320
When you become confused, spend 15 more minutes
trying to solve the problem on your own.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.509
Work line by line through the problem until
you know precisely where the confusion begins.

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:55.180
Also, try to write down the solutions you’ve
tried so far.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.240
Doing this essentially documents the
problem and creates context for the person
who will eventually help you –

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.640
and it might actually help you solve the
problem on your own as well.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:08.460
In the world of software development, programmers
who are stuck on broken pieces of code will often use
a technique called Rubber Duck Debugging,

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.180
which involves explaining the code and
thought process behind it to a rubber duck.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.760
The idea here is that explaining the
problem to a non-expert – in this case, a
cute little duck on your desk –

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.520
forces you to think about it from a different 
perspective, which will often reveal the solution.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.820
Additionally, going through this process will show
your teacher that you’ve truly put in some effort and
aren’t just coming to them for help out of laziness.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.760
And that’s a great way to earn their respect.

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:29.920
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.160
Now, if you want another really effective
way to solidify the material quickly, do a
cheat card exercise.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.150
Remember that really cool teacher that once
let you write whatever you wanted on an index
card and bring it with you into a test?

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:45.940
Because I do, and in my book, that teacher was
almost as cool as the one who let us play with
magnesium and bunsen burners unsupervised –
for science, of course.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.870
Now, most teachers aren’t going to let you
bring a cheat card into the exam – but that
shouldn’t stop you from making one.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:53.480
The thing about an index card is that it’s
small.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:07:00.120
And even though I pushed the limits of how tiny a
human hand can write whenever I got the opportunity to
make a cheat card, there’s only so much I could fit on it.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.200
And due to that limitation, I had to be very
choosy about what I put on the card –

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.000
which resulted in a tiny piece of cardstock containing
the most important information on the exam.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.940
And since I’d just spent an hour looking all that
stuff up and writing it down in teeny tiny letters, I
was interacting with it – actively – the whole time.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.140
That’s the beauty of a cheat card exercise.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:24.600
Even if you can’t bring your card with you into the test, you spend a concentrated block of time selecting and writing down the most crucial information.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.500
It’s a great preparation technique.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.910
Speaking of great preparation techniques,
the last one we’re going to cover today is
not studying.

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:32.180
At least some of the time.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:36.600
Students often believe that they should be
spending all of their time studying if they
want to do well, but remember:

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:41.260
how well you do is determined by the both the
time you put in and the intensity of your focus.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.520
And to enable your brain to focus intensely,
you have to give it some time off.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.140
The cycle of work and rest has to be respected.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.240
So when you’re crafting your study schedule,
give yourself time for breaks.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.280
That includes short breaks during review
sessions,

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.380
as well as some longer periods where
you can de-stress and reward yourself with some
of that good old high-density fun.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:01.870
Doing this will ensure that you’re alert,
attentive, and happy – well, as happy as somebody
with a calculus final coming up can be.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:08.320
And if you’re creating your study schedule
well in advance, you should have no problem
giving yourself time for these breaks while
also leaving enough hours open for studying.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.400
Speaking of breaks, it’s time for one now!

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.600
Hopefully this video has given you enough
direction to successfully prepare for any
exams you’ve got coming up.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.700
Next week we’ll be tackling test anxiety,
but I can give you a bit of a spoiler up front:

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:24.460
Good preparation – especially the type that
replicates the test conditions – is one of the
best ways to calm those nerves.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.300
So get to work making that upcoming test feel
like a familiar old friend, and I’ll see you next week.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:34.640
