VI HART: Yo, Brady.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.750
It's Vi Hart, and as promised,
I'm going throw you a Yahtzee.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.520
But to make it easier, I'm going
to use tetrahedral dice,

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.110
but to make it harder
again-- ooh, that

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.260
was four out of five.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.530
To make it harder again, I'm
going to use six of them.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:22.110
So you figure that out.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.580
Tetrahedral dice have many
survival advantages over the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.480
cubular dice, among which is
that they are very difficult

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.770
to pick up because
they're pointy.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.990
So I'm going to have to sweep
them off the table.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:44.145
They also don't roll as far as
your cube dice because they

00:00:44.145 --> 00:00:46.103
have sharper angles.

00:00:46.103 --> 00:00:55.763
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:55.763 --> 00:01:00.993
We are at roll number 100, as
you can see by the counter

00:01:00.993 --> 00:01:04.839
that I'm pressing with my foot,
which means it's time--

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.070
time for your next tetrahedral
superiority fact.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.210
Tetrahedra are also superior
to the cube in that they

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.760
always end point-up.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.250
They don't have the faces
opposite each other, unlike a

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.560
cube and, in fact, all other
platonic solids.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.070
When they land on the face, the
other face is facing up.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.090
But these have the point facing
up, which means that

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.350
they are dangerous as a natural
defense, which is I

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.360
guess why caltrops are designed
as a tetrahedron.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.000
They have tetrahedral
points, so that when

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.120
you throw them at--

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.770
they're always going
to land point-up.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.020
And if you stepped on one
of these, it would hurt.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.290
Unlike the cube, which
is weak and soft.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:58.470
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.162
We've gotten past 200.

00:02:01.162 --> 00:02:04.510
Time for your next tetrahedral
survival advantage fact.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.669
Tetrahedra don't roll as easily
as cube dice, because

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:14.180
they have this kind
of sharper angle.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.750
They are less likely
to accidentally

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.640
get lost and lonely.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.482
Moving onward.

00:02:18.482 --> 00:02:29.220
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.800
All right.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.340
So our 300th roll tetrahedron
fact time.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.040
As a platonic solid, Plato
thought that the tetrahedron

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.120
represented the element of fire,
because one, they're

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.000
pointy and they hurt you like
fire hurts you, and related to

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.950
the fact that they don't
roll easily, unlike the

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.110
icosahedron, which rolls so
easily, with that very wide

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.510
angle, that it rolls kind
of like water does.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.360
So that's what the icosahedron
was water, tetrahedron was

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.490
fire, and the cube, being stable
and boring, is earth.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:21.080
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.330
Oh!

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.610
I guess I got it.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.410
Man, and here I was busily
trying to think of more

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.350
tetrahedron facts.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.250
I did not expect to get
it this soon at all.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:42.400
I'm on 382.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.520
Here I was just thinking that I
should have gotten an intern

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.470
to do this for me and that I was
going to have nightmares

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.930
of tetrahedral dice
attacking me.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.080
But this actually
wasn't that bad.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.020
And yet I don't think the
chances of six four-sided dice

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:07.990
is actually that much lower
than of five cubes.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.876
(SINGING) Brady, I got a
Yahtzee, I got a Yahtzee.

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:12.720
Oh!

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.330
Two.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.640
Hey, Brady, it's
the number two.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.079
Just for you.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:18.810
Isn't that appropriate?

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.300
BRADY HARAN: Oh, oh, ooh.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.160
Ah, ow!

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.950
VI HART: Sorry, 2.

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.100
But you know, you look
good this way.

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.120
All right.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.740
I guess I might as well go
through some other tetrahedral

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:32.750
dice facts, although I don't
ever want to move my Yahtzee

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.065
from being a Yahtzee
ever again.

00:04:35.065 --> 00:04:36.810
Keeping those 2s up.

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.880
Tetrahedra are also superior to
the cube in that, well, as

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.990
a survival advantage,
cubes pack space.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.710
So like if you have a lot of
cubes, they might pack

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.810
together nice and tightly
like this.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.810
Which you might think is a plus,
because they use space

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.010
very efficiently.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.450
But on the other hand, if you
get your cube all surrounded

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.035
tightly by other cubes, the
cubes might suffocate and die.

00:05:04.035 --> 00:05:08.490
Whereas the tetrahedra, though
they look almost like they

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:13.240
might kind of pack space, like
you can fit five of them

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.270
around like this and it looks
like they almost fit

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.665
perfectly, but they don't.

00:05:18.665 --> 00:05:21.170
There's just like a
tiny little gap.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.540
And this gap enables even a
super-close-huddling group of

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.840
tetrahedra to breathe
and not suffocate.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.770
I thought I was going to be in
for a whole afternoon of

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.020
tetrahedron mania.
