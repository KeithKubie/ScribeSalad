00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.860
The table gives a position
s of a motorcyclist

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.660
for t between 0 and
3, including 0 and 3.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.950
This is just saying that
t is part of the interval,

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.390
or t in the interval
between 0 and 3.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.470
And we see that right over here,
where the distance traveled

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.160
s is measured in meters,
and t is time in seconds.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.460
Assume the motorcyclist
is accelerating

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.720
during a three-second period.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.094
And they give us
the information.

00:00:26.094 --> 00:00:28.680
This is time between 0
seconds and 3 seconds.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.170
And here we have the
corresponding distance

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.710
that you could view
as a function of time.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.470
The average velocity
for t between 1.5 and 2,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.580
so t between 1.5 and 2
is 23 meters per second.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.020
So what they did over here
is they figured out, well,

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.700
what is delta s over
delta t in this interval?

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.540
And they figured out that
it was 23 meters per second.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:56.670
And you can verify that.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.450
Your change in s
looks like it's 12.5.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.960
Your change in time is
point-- or actually,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.230
this looks like it's 11.5.

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:09.020
Yeah, 11.5.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.090
Your change in time is 0.5.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.040
11.5 divided by 0.5 is 23.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.340
So that makes sense.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.280
And then they tell us
the average velocity

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.810
for t between 2 and 2.5.

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.500
So change in our distance
over change in time,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.280
they say is 31.8
meters per second.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.440
And then they say, estimate
the instantaneous velocity at t

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.380
equals 2 seconds and
use this value to write

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.050
the equation of a line tangent
to s of t at the time t

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.280
equals 2.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.240
So we can try to approximate.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.900
We can approximate the
slope of the tangent line

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.990
right over here, right when
t equals 2 seconds, by taking

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.250
the average of the slopes of
the tangent lines between 1.5

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.150
and 2, and 2 and 2.5.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.100
So essentially, to approximate
the slope of the tangent line,

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.740
we're going to take the average
of these two rates of change

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.240
right over here, the
average of these two slopes.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.070
So let's do that.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:17.049
So the average is going
to be 23 plus 31.8 over 2.

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.590
And let's see, what
is that equal to?

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.000
That is equal to 54.8/2.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.711
And what is that equal to?

00:02:26.711 --> 00:02:27.210
Let's see.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.740
54 divided by 2 is 27.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.840
So it's 27.4.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.340
So we can use that
as our approximation

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.980
for the instantaneous
rate of change

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.800
for the slope of
the tangent line.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.360
And now we have to
actually figure out

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.010
what that equation actually is.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.600
They don't just want the slope.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.440
So this is the slope
right over here.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.560
And they say that they want
it in point-slope form.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.592
And they remind us that t
is the independent variable.

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:57.800
So when you're putting
something in point-slope form,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.008
it really just comes out of
the definition of a line.

00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:02.550
A line always has
a constant slope.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:09.910
So let's just imagine taking
a random point on that line,

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.550
t-- let me write it this
way-- t comma capital S--

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.620
a random point on the line,
on the tangent line here.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.600
Well, the slope between
that and this point

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.800
is always going to be constant.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.060
So what's the slope between
this point and this point?

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.120
Well, your change in S
is going to be S minus 2

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.110
over your change in t,
which is t minus-- oh sorry,

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.770
your S is S. This is
confusing sometimes.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.230
S minus 30.2 over your
change in t, t minus 2,

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.366
is equal to your slope.

00:03:51.366 --> 00:03:52.740
Anywhere along
that tangent line,

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.720
you're going to have
that slope, 27.4.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.250
And then you multiply
both sides by t minus 2,

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.890
and you've put it
in point-slope form.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.950
So this is the same
thing as S minus 30.2

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:13.750
is equal to 27.4
times t minus 2.
