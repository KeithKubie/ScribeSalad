00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.470

realize and they're running things that

we don't even understand for example

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280
we don't even understand for example

when you go for an MRI exam in the

when you go for an MRI exam in the
 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.670
when you go for an MRI exam in the
hospital that MRI be its algorithms are

actually interpreting the data for your

even read that when you fly on autopilot

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519
even read that when you fly on autopilot
 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.460
even read that when you fly on autopilot
on an airplane which is probably more

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470
on an airplane which is probably more
 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.560
on an airplane which is probably more
than 90 percent of your flight it's an

than 90 percent of your flight it's an
 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.539
than 90 percent of your flight it's an
algorithm that's running the plane and

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549
algorithm that's running the plane and
 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.270
algorithm that's running the plane and
all of those can be hacked much of the

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280
all of those can be hacked much of the
 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.430
all of those can be hacked much of the
attacks that occur in cyberspace whether

attacks that occur in cyberspace whether
 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.460

they be virus attacks ransomware denial

of service attacks are all scripted to

run which means a computer hacker or

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959
run which means a computer hacker or

criminal write some code and the code

criminal write some code and the code
 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.630
criminal write some code and the code
goes off and carries out the crime which

goes off and carries out the crime which
 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.360
goes off and carries out the crime which
means crime can scale and it can scale

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370
means crime can scale and it can scale
 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.070
means crime can scale and it can scale
exponentially and that's why we've seen

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080
exponentially and that's why we've seen
 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.789
exponentially and that's why we've seen
such a massive uptick
