00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.270
Let's say that you're
a watermelon farmer,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.079
and you want to study
how dense the seeds are

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.870
in your watermelon.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.230
Perhaps you want to do this
because over time, you're

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.680
trying to breed watermelons
that have fewer seeds,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.250
and you should see whether you
are actually making progress.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.920
And you don't want to
cut open every watermelon

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.310
in your watermelon farm
or patch or whatever

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.800
it might be called, because
you want to sell most of them.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.880
You just want to sample
a few watermelons,

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.780
and then take samples
of those watermelons

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.350
to figure out how dense the
seeds are, and hope that you

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.380
can calculate statistics
on those samples that

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.720
are decent estimates of the
parameters for the population.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.290
So let's start doing that.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.920
So let's say that you take these
little cubic inch chunks out

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.290
of a random sample
of your watermelons.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:50.800
And then you count the
number of seeds in them.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.840
And you have 8
samples like this.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.450
So in one of them,
you found 4 seeds.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:06.610
In the next, you found
3, 5, 7, 2, 9, 11, and 7.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.650
So this is a
sample, just to make

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.040
sure we're visualizing it right.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.707
If this is the population
of all of the chunks--

00:01:15.707 --> 00:01:17.540
I guess we could view
this as a cubic inch--

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.510
the cubic inch chunks in
my entire watermelon farm,

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.120
I'm sampling a very
small sample of them.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.190
Maybe I could have had
a million over here.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.960
A million chunks
of watermelon could

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.230
have been produced from
my farm, but I'm only

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.930
sampling-- so capital
N would be 1 million,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.244
lowercase n is equal to 8.

00:01:39.244 --> 00:01:41.410
And once again, you might
want to have more samples,

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.590
but this'll make our math easy.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.790
Now, let's think about what
statistics we can measure.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.720
Well, the first one
that we often do

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.720
is a measure of
central tendency.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.490
And that's the arithmetic mean.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.540
But here, we're trying to
estimate the population mean

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.510
by coming up with
the sample mean.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.710
So what is the sample
mean going to be?

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.259
Well, all we have to do
is add up these points,

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.780
add up these measurements,
and then divide

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.810
by the number of
measurements we have.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.360
So let's get our
calculator out for that.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.520
Actually, maybe I don't
need my calculator.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.020
Let's see.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.150
So 4 plus 3 is 7.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.980
7 plus 5 is 12.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.741
12 plus 7 is 19.

00:02:24.741 --> 00:02:33.130
19 plus 2 is 21, plus 9 is 30,
plus 11 is 41, plus 7 is 48.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.830
So I'm going to get
48 over 8 data points.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.540
So this worked out quite well.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.380
48 divided by 8 is equal to 6.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.610
So our sample mean is 6.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.520
It's our estimate of what
the population mean might be.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.400
But we also want to think about
how much in our population

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.080
we want to estimate, how
much spread is there,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.490
or how much do our measurements
vary from this mean.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.970
So there, we say, well, we can
try to estimate the population

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.800
variance by calculating
the sample variance.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.070
And we're going to calculate
the unbiased sample variance.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.150
Hopefully, we're fairly
convinced at this point

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.990
why we divide by n minus 1.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.154
So we're going to calculate
the unbiased sample variance.

00:03:20.154 --> 00:03:21.570
And if we do that,
what do we get?

00:03:24.364 --> 00:03:25.780
I'll do this in a
different color.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.680
It's going to be 4 minus 6
squared plus 3 minus 6 squared

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.060
plus 5 minus 6 squared
plus 7 minus 6 squared

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.210
plus 2 minus 6 squared
plus 9 minus 6 squared

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:51.860
plus 11 minus 6 squared plus
7 minus 6 squared, all of that

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.520
divided by-- not by 8.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.530
Remember, we want the
unbiased sample variance.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.320
We're going to divide
it by 8 minus 1.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.340
So we're going to divide by 7.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.610
Let me give myself a little
bit more real estate.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.996
The unbiased sample
variance-- and I could even

00:04:07.996 --> 00:04:09.870
denote it by this to
make it clear that we're

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.990
dividing by lowercase
n minus 1-- is going

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:18.040
to be equal to-- let's see,
4 minus 6 is negative 2.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.480
That squared is positive 4.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.829
So I did that one.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:23.350
3 minus 6 is negative 3.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.280
That squared is going to be 9.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.910
5 minus 6 squared is
1 squared, which is 1.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.780
7 minus 6 is once again
1 squared, which is 1.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:40.240
2 minus 6, negative
4 squared is 16.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.146
9 minus 6 squared, well,
that's going to be 9.

00:04:43.146 --> 00:04:48.640
11 minus 6 squared, that is 25.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.260
And then finally, 7 minus 6
squared, that's another 1.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.390
And we're going
to divide it by 7.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.750
Let's see if we can add
this up in our heads.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:10.650
4 plus 9 is 13, plus 1 is
14, 15, 31, 40, 65, 66.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.950
So this is going to
be equal to 66 over 7.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:20.760
And we could either divide--
we get that's 9 and 3/7.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.830
We could write
that as 9 and 3/7.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.940
Or if we want to write
that as a decimal,

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.800
I could just take
66 divided by 7

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.080
gives us 9 point--
I'll just round it.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:43.390
So it's approximately 9.43.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.400
Now, that gave us our
unbiased sample variance.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.840
Well, how could we calculate
a sample standard deviation?

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.270
We want to somehow get added
estimate of what the population

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.620
standard deviation might be.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.170
Well, the logic, I guess,
is reasonable to say, well,

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.290
this is our unbiased
sample variance.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.140
It's our best estimate of
what the true population

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:08.260
variance is.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.240
When we think about
population parameters

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.670
to get the population
standard deviation,

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:19.110
we just take the square root
of the population variance.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.310
So if we want to get an
estimate of the sample standard

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:25.410
deviation, why
don't we just take

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.835
the square root of the
unbiased sample variance?

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.370
So that's what we'll do.

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.740
So we'll define it that way.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.890
We'll call it the sample
standard deviation.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.650
We're going to define it to
be equal to the square root

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.950
of the unbiased sample variance.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.340
It's going to be the square
root of this quantity,

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.620
and we can take
our calculator out.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.250
It's going to be the square
root of what I just typed in.

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:51.190
I can do 2nd answer.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:52.684
It'll be the last entry here.

00:06:52.684 --> 00:06:54.850
So the square root of that
is-- and I'll just round.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:07:01.360
It's approximately
equal to 3.07.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.890
Now, I'm going to
tell you something

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:04.647
very counterintuitive.

00:07:04.647 --> 00:07:06.480
Or at least initially
it's counterintuitive,

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.160
but hopefully you'll
appreciate this over time.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.590
This we've already talked
about in some depth.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.090
People have even
created simulations

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:19.190
to show that this is an unbiased
estimate of population variance

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.096
when we divide it by n minus 1.

00:07:21.096 --> 00:07:22.804
And that's a good
starting point if we're

00:07:22.804 --> 00:07:24.554
going to take the
square root of anything.

00:07:24.554 --> 00:07:28.410
But it actually turns out
that because the square root

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.390
function is nonlinear,
that this sample standard

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.880
deviation-- and
this is how it tends

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:42.590
to be defined-- sample standard
deviation, that this sample

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:53.070
standard deviation, which is
the square root of our sample

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:57.670
variance, so from
i equals 1 to n

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.150
of our unbiased sample variance,
so we divide it by n minus 1.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.780
This is how we literally divide
our sample standard deviation.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:11.910
Because the square root
function is nonlinear,

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:16.540
it turns out that this is
not an unbiased estimate

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.250
of the true population
standard deviation.

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.410
And I encourage people to
make simulations of that

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.865
if they're interested.

00:08:24.865 --> 00:08:27.240
But then you might say, well,
we went through great pains

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.510
to divide by n minus
1 here in order

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.770
to get an unbiased estimate
of the population variance.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.520
Why don't we go
through similar pains

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.700
and somehow figure out a
formula for an unbiased estimate

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.640
of the population
standard deviation?

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.100
And the reason why
that's difficult

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.909
is to unbias the
sample variance,

00:08:46.909 --> 00:08:48.950
we just have to divide by
n minus 1 instead of n.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.650
And that'd work for any
probability distribution

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.150
for our population.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.540
It turns out to
do the same thing

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.270
for the standard deviation.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.480
It's not that easy.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.650
It's actually dependent on how
that population is actually

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:03.650
distributed.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:07.850
So in statistics, we just define
the sample standard deviation.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:10.880
And the one that
we typically use

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.440
is based on the square root of
the unbiased sample variance.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.750
But when you take
that square root,

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:25.020
it does give you a
biased result when

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.820
you're trying to use this
to estimate the population

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:28.990
standard deviation.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:32.120
But it's the simplest,
best tool we have.
