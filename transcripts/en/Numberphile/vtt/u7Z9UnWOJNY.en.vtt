00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.580
DR. JAMES GRIME: So Zeno's
paradox is a problem that's

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.390
not just of interest to
mathematicians, like myself.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.410
But it's also of interest to
physicists and philosophers.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.530
And it has been for thousands
of years.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.350
So Zeno was a Greek
philosopher.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.660
He lived 2,500 years ago.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.010
And he came up with a
list of paradoxes.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.110
There's about nine of
these paradoxes.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.170
The ones I want to talk about,
though, are kind of similar.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.600
The first one, though, I love,
because there's a nice little

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.430
story with it.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.700
So the first one is called
Achilles and the Tortoise.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.750
You've got Achilles and the
tortoise in a race.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.030
Now, the tortoise is
slower, of course.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.470
So he's given a head start.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.320
He's got a 100 meter
head start.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.020
And then they start the race.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.270
Now, Achilles sprints 100
meters, and he catches up to

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.500
where the tortoise was.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.900
But in that time, the tortoise
has moved on.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.730
He's moved on 10 meters.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.730
So Achilles now has to sprint
to catch up with

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.760
the tortoise, again.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.610
So he sprints another 10 meters,
and he catches up to

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.540
where the tortoise was.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.220
Now, since that time,
the tortoise has

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.610
moved on another meter.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.850
So Achilles has to sprint
to catch up to where

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.000
the tortoise was.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.810
And this keeps happening
over and over again.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.790
So the paradox is does Achilles
ever catch up with

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.370
the tortoise?

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.580
And that's insane.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.410
And obviously, he must do.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.170
We all live in the real world.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.190
He must catch up with
the tortoise.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.490
Another of these paradoxes is
basically the same, but it's a

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.540
bit simpler.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.250
I'm holding my hands
apart like that.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.875
Now, I'm going to keep
my left hand still.

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:45.850
I'm going to move my right hand
towards my left hand so

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.710
that they clap.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.570
Now, when I do that--

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.000
actually, you can think of it
like I'm halving the distance.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.610
I then halve the distance
again and then halve the

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.290
distance again and again
and again and again.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.830
And I halve the distance an
infinite number of times,

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.640
infinitely many times.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.705
So does that mean my
hands never clap?

00:02:06.705 --> 00:02:09.039
Is there some sort of
force field here

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.930
stopping my hands meeting?

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.010
Well, obviously, they do.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.130
This is the paradox.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.770
So what's going on here?

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.320
How can an infinite
process end?

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.950
What's going on?

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.590
And this is part of
Zeno's paradoxes.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.640
I want to give you the
mathematician's point of view

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.290
for this, because, well, some
say that the mathematicians

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.640
have sorted this out.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.020
Let's say I start with my
hands 2 meters apart.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.960
And then I'm going to
join them together.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.200
So they start 2 meters apart,
and then I halve the distance.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.130
So I've traveled 1 meter.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.580
I then halve the distance again,
so we've now traveled

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.210
another half a meter.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.320
Then you do that again, you
halve the distance again.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.850
So now, your hands have traveled
1/4 of a meter.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:06.760
And then it's an 1/8
and 1/16 and 1/32.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.180
And then you keep doing
this forever, halving

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.350
the distance forever.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.310
Let's say this does
have a value.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.290
Let's give it a value.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.795
Let's call it S--

00:03:14.795 --> 00:03:16.070
S for sum.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.690
Here's a trick that
you can do.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.140
First of all, I'm going
to multiply by 1/2.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.650
I'm going to multiply the
whole thing by 1/2.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.270
So if I multiply the left hand
side by 1/2, you get 1/2 of S.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.170
On the right hand side,
I'm going to multiply

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.520
term by term by 1/2.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.020
So 1 multiplied by 1/2 is 1/2.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.242
I'm just going to write that
there-- going to leave a

00:03:42.242 --> 00:03:43.600
little gap.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.400
Now, I'm going to multiply
the 1/2 by 1/2,

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.610
which gives me 1/4.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.470
And I'm doing it by term by
term, so 1/4 times 1/2 is 1/8,

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.290
and 1/8 by 1/2 is 1/16.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.170
Now, I'm going to subtract
those two things.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.590
If I subtract, from the left,
I get S minus 1/2 S, which

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.180
gives you 1/2 S. On the right
hand side, I'm going to

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.830
subtract these two lines.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.370
So I've got 1.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.170
And I've got plus 1/2 minus 1/2
plus 1/4 minus 1/4 plus

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.810
1/8 minus 1/8.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.030
And all the terms cancel out.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:28.560
So all you're left with is 1,
which means, if everything's

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.770
canceled out then, you can
work out what S is.

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.770
S is equal to 2.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.590
So this would be 2 meters.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.160
So your hands would
travel 2 meters.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.790
Even though it's an infinite
process, your

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.240
hands do travel 2 meters.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.640
Now, time is important,
as well.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.210
If each step was taking a
second, then that's an

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.950
infinite number of seconds,
or if it was

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.550
longer than a second.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.220
So you would complete your
2 meters, but it takes an

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.820
infinite amount of time to
complete your 2 meters.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.980
So time is important as well.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.230
So let's say we'll do it a
little bit faster than that.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.350
Let's say I move 1
meter per second.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.450
So I'm going to move
1 meter per second.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.892
It's the same, working out.

00:05:14.892 --> 00:05:18.550
If I halve the distance, that
would take me 1 second.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.700
And then I halved the distance
again-- it would take me 1/2

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.160
second, then 1/4 second.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.160
So I could travel 2 meters
in 2 seconds.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.540
And my hands would clap.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.410
So something like this-- an
infinite sum-- behaves well

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.940
when, if you take the sum and
then you keep adding one term

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.130
at a time, so you've got lots
of different sums getting

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:42.600
closer and closer
to your answer.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.980
If that's the case, if
your partial sums--

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.380
that's what they're called-- are
getting closer and closer

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:56.210
to a value, then we say that's
a well-behaved sum, and at

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.270
infinity, it is equal
to it exactly.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.730
And it's not just getting closer
and closer but not

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:04.510
quite reaching.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.750
It is actually the whole
thing properly.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.700
So it sounds like I'm saying
that you can complete an

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.070
infinite process.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.330
Now, an infinite process doesn't
have a last step.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.380
So how can something without
a last step be completed?

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.994
And that's the paradox.

00:06:22.994 --> 00:06:24.090
BRADY HARAN: What is the--

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.310
and is there a solution?

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.550
DR. JAMES GRIME: I have no easy
answers for you here.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.700
This is a paradox that has
baffled philosophers and

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.180
mathematicians for
2,500 years.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.285
I wrestle with it as well.

00:06:38.285 --> 00:06:42.740
There are greater minds than you
and I that have wrestled

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.920
with this problem in the
last 2,500 years.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.430
If this melts your brain,
don't worry.

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.320
You are in very good company.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.630
BRADY HARAN: Some of these
numbers where the digits

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.590
apparently go on forever
and ever--

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.026
pi, the square root of 2--

00:07:00.026 --> 00:07:01.960
how do they fit into all this?

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.240
DR. JAMES GRIME: Yeah.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.875
So if something goes on forever,
it's almost like

00:07:04.875 --> 00:07:09.350
you're asking, can I even draw
something with these decimal

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.060
representations that
never finish?

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:14.865
And it's the same sort of
problem that we've got here.

00:07:14.865 --> 00:07:16.970
But again, even though
that's an infinite

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.970
process, it can be completed.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:20.830
And I know that's bizarre.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.070
But look.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:28.010
If I draw a triangle, that has
length 1, that has length 1.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.420
It's a right angle.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.810
And this has length the
square root of 2.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.210
And there's no reason I can't
do that, even though the

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:37.670
square root of 2 is irrational,
which means the

00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:40.100
decimals go on forever.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.610
Even though it's like that,
there's nothing stopping me

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.120
from drawing it.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.180
In the same way, there's nothing
stopping me from

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.020
clapping my hands.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.790
You can think of this as
an infinite process.

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:55.610
I'm halving the distance an
infinite number of times.

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.430
But I can still clap my hands.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.040
So these 19th century
mathematicians had to work out

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.790
when these infinite sums behaved
well and when they

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:06.170
behaved badly.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:09.680
And so there's a lot of
technical detail behind that.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.050
And it just turned out to be
rigorous and consistent, which

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.250
is very important.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:19.090
But some of the tests that
you can use to prove that

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:21.610
something is a well-behaved
sum--

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:22.630
well, they're quite easy.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:23.780
I'll show you one.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.440
What you can do is if you take
one of these terms--

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.246
I'm actually going
to call it a.

00:08:30.246 --> 00:08:33.780
You take one of them,
the nth term--

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:34.500
an.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:38.659
You divide that by the one that
came before it, and if

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:42.230
it's negative, well, you'll
make it positive, then.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.159
If you take those numbers--

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:47.390
if those numbers go
towards a value--

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:52.780
let's call it r, as these
n's get bigger.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:57.270
If these numbers tend towards a
value, and if that number is

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.720
less than 1, then it's
well-behaved.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.870
So this was well-behaved.

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.340
Why was this well-behaved?

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.780
Because if you take one of those
terms and divide by the

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.730
one that came before it,
you always get 1/2.

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:13.360
Look.

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.060
1/2 divided by 1 is 1/2.

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:19.110
1/4 divided by 1/2
is also 1/2.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.780
These are all halves,
actually.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.490
You get a common
factor of 1/2--

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.450
common ratio of 1/2
for each one.

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.095
That passes the test.

00:09:28.095 --> 00:09:29.060
And that's what this is.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.230
This is a test.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:31.090
So it passes the test.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.470
This is well-behaved.

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:39.880
If this was bigger than 1, then
it's not well-behaved.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.140
And that could mean--

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:44.560
well, it could mean it
goes on to infinity.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.750
Or it could mean it's periodic
or does something else weird.

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.630
So it's not well-behaved.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:54.050
And the other case is if this
number was equal to 1, we

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.570
don't know.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:56.310
It could be anything.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:57.030
It could be either.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.350
It could be well-behaved
or not.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.400
It depends.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.042
So r equals to 1,
we're not sure.

00:10:03.042 --> 00:10:06.810
BRADY HARAN: What's a series
where r is greater than 1?

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.460
Can you show me, what's a
badly behaved series?

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.130
DR. JAMES GRIME: So if it was
bigger than 1, than the terms

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.040
would be getting bigger and
bigger and bigger each time,

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.230
maybe not in a common
ratio way.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:19.380
Well, we were talking about the

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.870
Fibonacci sequence earlier.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:25.340
So if we had something
like that, like 1

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:28.510
and 1 and 2 and 3.

00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:31.210
If you divide those, they don't
have a common ratio.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.750
But actually, the ratio
is tending to

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.910
1.618, the golden ratio.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.090
So 1.618 would be
bigger than 1.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.490
And this would be
badly behaved.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.140
If you added them together, you
would get a number that

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.940
was going off to infinity
in that case.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.195
And that would be called
divergent.

00:10:49.195 --> 00:10:50.965
This is well-behaved,
our example.

00:10:50.965 --> 00:10:53.130
And it's called convergent.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:57.100
My question to physicists is if
we were literal about this

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:01.630
and considered the real world
so that we are actually

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:05.300
dividing a distance repeatedly
in half over and over again

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:09.390
infinitely many times, or
dividing the time it takes to

00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.780
complete each step infinitely
many times so it's getting

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.970
quicker, can you do that?

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:20.170
Can you divide space and time
infinitely many times?

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.790
I don't know the
answer to that.

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:25.070
So I want a physicist
to tell me.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:29.110
We're in slightly the area of
calculus, as well, which some

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:33.150
of you may meet when you get
higher up at school.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.330
Calculus helps you work out the
area by adding up really

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.050
thin strips together.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.260
And it's in the same area.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:45.910
So Newton and Leibniz were
trying to add up areas by

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.960
taking strips that were
really, really thin--

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.150
not quite 0, but close to 0.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:57.260
And this idea was later replaced
with what we did

00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:01.110
here, the 19th century
idea called limits.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:04.280
So this has taken a long
time to work out.
