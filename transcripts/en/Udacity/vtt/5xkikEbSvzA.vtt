00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.610
To illustrate production systems, let us imagine that you are a baseball

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.050
pitcher. This illustration is coming from a game between Atlanta Braves and

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.240
the Arizona Diamondbacks. Here is a pitcher on the mound, and a pitcher has to

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.560
decide, whether to pitch a ball to the batter, or whether to walk the batter.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.980
To be more specific, take a look at the story here in the left. Read it.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.270
And to decide what would the pitcher do. What would you do?

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.920
What would an intelligent agent do? If you don't know much about baseball,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.491
don't worry about it. Part of the goal here is to see what someone who

00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:37.201
does not know about, a lot about baseball may do.
