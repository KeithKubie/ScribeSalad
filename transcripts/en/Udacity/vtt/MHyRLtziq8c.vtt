00:00:01.061 --> 00:00:02.847
All right! You're done.

00:00:02.847 --> 00:00:04.693
Let's take a look at my solution.

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:08.476
All right. So, here's what
our addLocation function looks like.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:13.419
locationSetting, cityName,
latitude, and longitude.

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:15.423
Just like in our content provider test,

00:00:15.423 --> 00:00:18.875
we can use getContentResolver
to query based upon the content URI.

00:00:20.048 --> 00:00:22.756
Remember that the default
location entry CONTENT_URI

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:25.152
passes all of the parameters
into the database.

00:00:25.152 --> 00:00:27.390
So we can easily construct a query

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.690
containing the location setting
to see if it's in the database yet.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.559
If it's not, then the query
will return an empty set

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.580
and we should insert
the new city name, location setting,

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.203
latitude, and longitude
into the database together.
