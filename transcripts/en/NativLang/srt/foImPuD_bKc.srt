1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,260
It turns out that in some languages
out there, people sing when they speak.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:06,150
So how does that work?

3
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:08,073
Okay.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:13,230
When you think of the sounds that
you put together to make a word,

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,820
vowels and consonants come to
mind, and that's good usually.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,780
But to build words in tonal
languages like a house or Mandarin,

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,790
you need another set of musical pieces
called tones to make meaning. Yes.

8
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:30,330
These languages pay attention to higher
and lower notes like a singer or a

9
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:31,200
musician would.

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,370
They don't do this by requiring their
speakers to have perfect pitch and hit the

11
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:37,290
same notes as everyone else every time.

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,830
Not everyone who speaks your language
will be a metal soprano after all.

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,320
So if it's not about the specific notes,

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,020
how do tonal languages use so many tones?

15
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,750
They pay attention to changes in pitch.

16
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,990
A syllable sung higher hot
can mean something different
than that same syllable.

17
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,420
Sun Lower are linguistically.

18
00:00:57,421 --> 00:01:01,910
We would count these as two
different tones, whether you're high,

19
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,570
low or just right in the middle,
you're contrasting steady notes.

20
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,830
These different pitches are
called register tones in the band,

21
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:14,490
two languages of Africa and
Athabaskan languages like Navajo.

22
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,540
The two basic register tones
are a high tone and a low tone.

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,760
Changes in pitch can get more
dynamic, rising, falling, bouncing,

24
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,970
or staying level like they
do in mandarin or Vietnamese.

25
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,090
These tones are more about
the shape of the tone,

26
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:33,120
not simply whether the
note stays high or lower,

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,570
so they're called contour
tones. In Mandarin,

28
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:41,460
a syllable can be pronounced in four
different contour tones. In Tai,

29
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,470
there are five contour tones.

30
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,240
Think you've mastered register versus
contour tones. Well then combine them.

31
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,640
Mandarin may have four contrary tones,

32
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,590
but look to the south to see how Cantonese
distinguishes a low rising tone from

33
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:59,790
a medium rising tone. Oh, and
it also has a high level tone,

34
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:03,420
which is different from a medium
level tone and a low level tone.

35
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:08,430
Add in that low falling tone and
you've got six ways to sing a Cantonese

36
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:13,050
syllable. Notice that both register
and contoured tones are some on valves.

37
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,840
Continents have your
tongue blocking, smacking.

38
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,130
We're pushing the airflow around.

39
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,670
Unlike this smooth vibrating
air characteristic of valves,

40
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,570
which makes them the perfect
environment for sing song. Eat tones.

41
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:29,100
Tones are an extra feature that
tonal languages use to build words.

42
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:33,840
Rising level and falling
are as distinct as PT and k.

43
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,010
So speaking of word in the wrong tone in
one of these languages can sound as bad

44
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:42,410
as putting a keyword doesn't belong.
This makes tonality in the tutorial.

45
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:45,840
A really difficult feature to pick
up for people coming from a non tonal

46
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:49,080
language like English,
much sympathy my friend.

47
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,850
So keep your ears alert and
practice, practice, practice.

48
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,300
Thanks again for learning with
me and subscribed for language.

49
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:57,710
Okay.
