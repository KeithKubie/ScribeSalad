ENRICO BIANCO: Thank you,
everybody who has shown up here

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.180
in person and everybody who's
tuning in on the live stream.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.150
My name is Enrico
Bianco, and I serve

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.860
as the neurodiversity at work
lead for Special Needs Network.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.750
For those of you
who aren't familiar,

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.390
Special Needs Network is a
company-wide employee resource

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.450
group.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.450
We're about 800 strong by
the Google group numbers,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.000
and we cover a wide
range of topics.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.710
If you identify as
somebody with special needs

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.230
or as neurodiverse, or if
you have a friend, relative,

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.770
or somebody else
who you are caring

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.120
for who falls into
that category,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.280
or if you are simply interested
in knowing more about how

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.210
to be an ally and improving
things within the company,

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.920
we are your group.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.630
And this is one of
a number of talks

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.210
that we have had in our Special
Needs Network speaker series.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.280
And we're really excited
to host this talk today.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.080
So when Florida Frenz
was a young girl,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.460
she decided that she
wanted to write a book.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.470
And she compiled her
experiences growing up

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.530
autistic and her
artwork into a book

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.230
called "How to Be Human-- the
Diary of an Autistic Girl."

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.010
And now, she is stepping
out from behind her pen name

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.920
to readdress the world
as herself, Georgia Lyon.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.070
And so, on behalf of Google
and the Special Needs Network,

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.716
please join me in
welcoming Georgia Lyon.

00:01:37.716 --> 00:01:42.696
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:42.696 --> 00:01:45.330
ENRICO BIANCO: So to
start off, what motivated

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.090
you to write "How to be Human"?

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.750
GEORGIA LYON: Well, I had always
had a dream of writing a book,

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.155
ever since I read "Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's Stone"

00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:53.995
at age seven.

00:01:53.995 --> 00:01:55.036
ENRICO BIANCO: [LAUGHING]

00:01:55.036 --> 00:01:57.860
GEORGIA LYON: So I would
say the biggest motivation

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.960
for me was just I really wanted
to get that life goal done.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.780
But I think, as I
was writing the book,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.330
I sort of realized, hey,
my life could actually

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.190
help other people.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.110
The things I've been
through could actually

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.810
help a lot of other people,
too, in ways that I had never

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.589
really thought about before.

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:17.880
I'd only really thought about
my individual experiences

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.550
with autism.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.910
But I'd never seen
how it could tie

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.750
to other people
and the collective,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.340
I guess, autistic
experience as a whole.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.200
So through writing
the book, I saw that.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.647
And I think, once I actually
had the book published,

00:02:31.647 --> 00:02:33.730
I was, like, well, that
was actually a good reason

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.630
to write the book, too, not
just for myself, but for others.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.660
ENRICO BIANCO: Right.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.660
And how did you come up with
the pen name, Florida Frenz?

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.520
GEORGIA LYON: Well, I guess
Florida came from the fact

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.080
that my first name is Georgia.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.110
So I just thought of
it as being in, like,

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.540
a different state of mind.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.130
And that pun was totally
intended, by the way.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.475
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:56.475 --> 00:02:58.870
GEORGIA LYON: And then
Frenz I just chose

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.570
because it's
spelled differently.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.800
But it's a pun off of the
word, like, "friends" plural.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.810
Because so much of the
book is about emotions

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.215
and social skills and the stuff
you would need to make friends.

00:03:12.215 --> 00:03:13.390
ENRICO BIANCO: Right.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.652
And so you wrote that book
when you were how old?

00:03:18.652 --> 00:03:22.230
GEORGIA LYON: Well, I wrote
it officially when I was 15.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.760
But a lot of the artwork, I
did back when I was eight.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.120
ENRICO BIANCO: Right.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.880
So that was at 15.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.880
And now, as a
young adult, you're

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.770
stepping out from behind
that pen name, Florida Frenz,

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.500
and reintroducing yourself to
the world under your real name.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.089
Can you tell us a bit about
what inspired you to do that?

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:42.380
GEORGIA LYON: The only reason
I really had the pen name

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.000
originally was because
I wanted some privacy

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.300
while I finished high school.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.410
As you probably know,
high school around here

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.820
is very rigorous, and I
needed a lot of energy

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.820
to be able to focus
on my academics

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.280
and learn as best I could.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.330
And I felt that if people knew
I'd published a book, well,

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.950
first of all, I would just get
a lot of attention for that.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.400
Second of all, I wasn't
sure if that attention

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.880
would be completely
positive, knowing

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.640
how kind of immature
high schoolers can be.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.370
So when I published
the book, of course,

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.140
all my classmates were 15, too.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.740
So it's not exactly
the best age.

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.899
But I guess what's
motivated me to step out

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:24.241
now is that, obviously,
I've graduated high school.

00:04:24.241 --> 00:04:25.490
I'm about to go on to college.

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.500
I don't care as much if people
know private information

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.700
about my personal experiences
or if they judge it.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.590
Because I figure if they
have time to judge me,

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.994
then they probably should
be doing other things

00:04:37.994 --> 00:04:38.660
with their life.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.420
And, you know, it is what it is.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.980
ENRICO BIANCO: That is a
good philosophy, definitely.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.290
So when and how did you
learn that you were autistic?

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:49.100
GEORGIA LYON: I
learned at age seven,

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.930
when I was watching this
show called "Dogs with Jobs."

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.660
It featured dogs helping
people with various things,

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.130
you know, search and rescue
dogs, dogs for the blind.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.200
And one episode
featured a dog who

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.570
was helping a boy with autism.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.339
And I looked at that boy.

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:07.130
And in many ways, he
was different from me.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.350
But I noticed one
similarity, which

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.310
was that when he got excited,
he flapped his hands like I

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.940
did when I was excited.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.370
And after watching the
show, I was eating a snack.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.270
And I just kind of
casually asked my mom.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.360
I was like, Mom,
do I have autism?

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.710
And there was just
sort of this pause.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.110
And then, a little surprised,
she said, yeah, you do.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.670
And that was a bit of a,
I guess, shock for me.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.200
I mean, I had always kind
of sensed I was different.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.390
In some ways, it eventually
was a step forward.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.870
But, I think, at first, it
was kind of a step back,

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.950
because I wondered
if she hadn't told me

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.860
because there was something
seriously wrong with me.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.070
So that was not a good
feeling to have initially

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:56.036
upon finding out I had autism.

00:05:56.036 --> 00:05:57.880
ENRICO BIANCO: But
further to that,

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.260
actually, how did learning
that you are autistic

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.330
sort of affect the way that
you thought about yourself

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:06.150
and others at that time?

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.110
GEORGIA LYON: I
think, at that time,

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.400
it made me feel like I was
somehow lesser than others,

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.220
or others couldn't
really like me

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.030
because I had some, like,
weird disability or disease.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.650
And, you know, when
you're seven or eight,

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.570
you do want to be
like everyone else.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:23.516
ENRICO BIANCO: Um, hm.

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:25.030
GEORGIA LYON: So
that made it hard.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.210
But, I think, over
time, I sort of

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.160
realized that I do
have challenges,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.590
but other people do, as well.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.980
And while they may face
different challenges,

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:37.620
just the fact that everyone
struggles with something

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.890
is sort of something
that connects me

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.030
with the rest of humanity.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.850
So, I think, over time,
it allowed me to actually

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.685
empathize with people more.

00:06:47.685 --> 00:06:48.880
ENRICO BIANCO: Right.

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.746
And speaking of challenges,
what do you think

00:06:51.746 --> 00:06:53.245
were the most
significant challenges

00:06:53.245 --> 00:06:56.250
that you faced
growing up autistic?

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:59.730
GEORGIA LYON: Understanding my
own emotions was definitely one

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:03.790
and understanding the
emotions of other people.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:05.610
If you can't do
that, man, the world

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.070
is a really scary
and confusing place.

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.160
But I guess what
helped me with that

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.950
was just I did a lot
of artwork with Shelah.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:20.701
She is in the room-- but, yeah--
back there in the nice red tank

00:07:20.701 --> 00:07:21.200
top.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.640
And I think doing that
artwork kind of allowed

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.640
me to slow down the whole
process of social interactions.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.094
Because usually they
happen very quickly.

00:07:31.094 --> 00:07:32.260
It's sort of lightning fast.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.750
You have to be able to read many
small cues, micro expressions,

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.886
et cetera.

00:07:36.886 --> 00:07:38.600
But when I was
doing art, I could

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.170
have time to kind of look
at what I was creating,

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.070
really think about it,
attach something tangible

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:48.410
to what otherwise might be
abstract and chaotic thoughts.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:50.590
And through that
process, I learned

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.150
how to understand emotions.

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.940
And once I understood
my own emotions,

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.800
it was much easier for
me to feel in control

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.690
and have enough,
I guess, bandwidth

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:03.170
in my brain to try to understand
the emotions of other people,

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:03.830
too.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.680
ENRICO BIANCO: That's really
fascinating, actually.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.470
So how did you pick up or
learn your social skills?

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:14.175
What methods did you
find worked best for you?

00:08:14.175 --> 00:08:17.950
GEORGIA LYON: Well, as I already
said, a lot of drawing and just

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.282
talking about social situations
with either my therapists

00:08:22.282 --> 00:08:23.990
or, once I was a little
bit more advanced

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.610
with my social skills, the
friends that I managed to make.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:27.550
ENRICO BIANCO: Hm.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:30.110
GEORGIA LYON: But I really
wish there was a better way

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.610
to say this.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.600
I think there's just a lot
of trial and error, you know.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.650
For those of you
have read "Outliers,"

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:37.447
Malcolm Gladwell
says that if you

00:08:37.447 --> 00:08:39.030
want to become an
expert in something,

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.500
you need 10,000 hours of
just brute-force practice.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.420
Well, that's the
best way to learn

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.820
how to pass as a
neurotypical, is just

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:50.090
brute-force practice,
lots of trial and error,

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.946
and some rather
embarrassing moments.

00:08:52.946 --> 00:08:53.446
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:53.446 --> 00:08:55.800
ENRICO BIANCO: I
wonder how many hours

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.550
you have accumulated
over all, then,

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.280
in deliberate practice
at being social.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.360
I think that number
might be a little bit

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.080
staggering for myself, too.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.250
So as a teenager,
how open were you

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.662
with others about
being autistic?

00:09:09.662 --> 00:09:12.660
GEORGIA LYON: I was pretty
open with my friends, honestly,

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.590
my close friends at least.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:19.990
With just casual acquaintances,
maybe not as much, and not

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.170
always as open with
my teachers, but I

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:26.040
think I was open with the
people I really cared about

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.310
and who I felt would
just like me for me.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:32.650
And then, for people I wasn't as
sure of whether they would just

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:36.690
like me for me or how they
would view me, I wasn't as open.

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:38.570
But I never exactly hid it.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.905
It just wasn't something
I would publicly declare.

00:09:40.905 --> 00:09:43.530
Like, I wouldn't just run into
a room and shout, hey, everyone,

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.624
I'm autistic, you know.

00:09:44.624 --> 00:09:45.864
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:45.864 --> 00:09:47.280
GEORGIA LYON: But,
I mean, if they

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:49.654
saw me flapping and figured
it out, I really didn't care.

00:09:49.654 --> 00:09:51.470
ENRICO BIANCO: Right.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:55.020
And what are your thoughts
on disclosure now, actually?

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.870
GEORGIA LYON: I think it's
a very nuanced subject,

00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:59.890
to be perfectly honest.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:03.520
I don't think there is one
formula for when to disclose

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.370
or how to disclose.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.370
You kind of have to just go by
what you feel comfortable with.

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:10.459
And I think, within
the autistic community,

00:10:10.459 --> 00:10:12.500
some people will feel more
comfortable disclosing

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.090
about their autism than others.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:19.380
Personally, I generally, as I
said, disclose to my friends,

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.030
whatever acquaintances I feel
comfortable with, my teachers,

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:23.780
sometimes, if I
feel comfortable.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:28.440
But, you know, I don't think
there is a one-size-fit-all

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.670
model for disclosing.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:32.600
ENRICO BIANCO: That's very true.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.590
I have found that to be
true of myself, as well.

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.790
Sometimes it's just something
you have to figure out

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:42.290
on a case-by-case basis.

00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:46.100
So what challenges would you
say that you face presently

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.235
because of autism?

00:10:47.235 --> 00:10:49.360
GEORGIA LYON: For
me personally, it's

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.280
mostly the sensory
overload aspect of it now.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:56.240
I feel, in general, that I can
read social cues a lot better

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.780
than when I was younger.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.644
But it gets very hard when
there's a lot going on

00:11:00.644 --> 00:11:01.435
in the environment.

00:11:01.435 --> 00:11:04.250
And especially in
noisy environments,

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:07.060
I seem to have more
sound sensitivities

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:09.549
than I think a lot
of people who are,

00:11:09.549 --> 00:11:11.840
quote unquote, "this high
functioning" on the spectrum.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:17.490
But I think, yeah, that's
the main part, just going

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.895
into a new environment, almost
having this physical need

00:11:20.895 --> 00:11:24.490
to, like, look at everything
in there and just take it in

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.040
before I can even really
interact with people

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.490
or fully enjoy myself, just
the constant stress of always

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:35.060
having background noises, like
voices, doors closing, fans.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.560
I'm just using various
examples of noises

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.890
I actually hear in this
room, which is fairly quiet.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:43.010
But, you know, obviously,
in other environments,

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.520
like in high school,
oh, man, there

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.530
was just constant chatter,
even during tests and stuff.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:48.531
So that was rough.

00:11:48.531 --> 00:11:50.530
ENRICO BIANCO: I can sort
of identify with that.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.640
The one that I'm really
noticing right now

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.400
is the way that
the room is lit--

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.852
GEORGIA LYON: Oh, yeah.

00:11:55.852 --> 00:11:57.810
ENRICO BIANCO: --the
lights overhead as well as

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.900
the sunlight coming
in from the window.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.610
So, yeah, I don't
think that I have

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:05.730
maybe all of the sensory
integration issues.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.750
It's very different
for everyone.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:11.380
But it's definitely noticeable.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.660
What advantages would you
say that an autistic mind

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.906
has afforded you?

00:12:15.906 --> 00:12:18.150
GEORGIA LYON: I think it's
afforded me the ability

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:19.770
to be a bit more rational.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.800
So for example, back
in middle school,

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.300
when most people are catapulting
between extreme highs and lows

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.230
emotionally, I was able to
kind of stabilize myself

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:31.290
by thinking of life this way.

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:34.366
So if I had a day, and some
good stuff had happened

00:12:34.366 --> 00:12:36.240
and some bad stuff had
happened, I'd be like,

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.614
well, this part of the day
was good, this part of the day

00:12:38.614 --> 00:12:39.180
was bad.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.380
If I average the two,
it's an average day.

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:44.540
And just kind of move on
with life, instead of getting

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:49.614
caught up in the emotional
back and forth of everything.

00:12:49.614 --> 00:12:51.030
And then, I think,
another big one

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:54.500
has been it's allowed me
to have very strong morals.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.020
Because I'm sure
many of you have

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.830
heard that autistic people are
very black and white thinkers.

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:03.070
And I think, when it
comes to sort of ideals,

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.140
that can be a good thing.

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.950
Because I know it allows
me to be a loyal friend.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:09.650
Because there's just
some rules that I

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:13.990
follow when I'm with my friends,
that just mean that, you know,

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:15.940
I'm just kind to them
when I'm around them

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:18.700
or try to be the
best friend I can be.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:21.200
I try not to get caught up
in, like, the social drama

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.200
or project my own emotional
turmoil onto them,

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.510
unlike some people
do, unfortunately.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:30.010
And I think it's allowed me to
be a strong student, as well.

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.010
Because generally, I'm
very honest with my work,

00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:35.440
and I don't plagiarize
or cheat or do stuff

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:38.560
like that, so strong morals.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.890
And then I think the final
one, which many people

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:44.520
seem to think is actually a
deficit in autism, is empathy.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.270
I really think that
having autism and having

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:50.760
the experiences
I've had has allowed

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.840
me to be much more
empathetic towards people

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:56.000
who are just outsiders in
any way, shape, or form.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.020
Like, I just remember, during
my middle school days or even

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:04.230
my early high school days, if
I was talking with someone,

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:06.915
and we were hitting it off and
everything was going great,

00:14:06.915 --> 00:14:08.540
but a third person
came up and was sort

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.437
of awkwardly hanging on
the outside of the group,

00:14:11.437 --> 00:14:13.770
not sure what to do, I would
always be the one who'd be,

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.830
like, so what do you
think of this or that?

00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:17.746
And I would kind of bring
them into the group,

00:14:17.746 --> 00:14:21.410
because I just remember so
much as a young child, when

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.300
I was, like, six or
seven, I would always

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.190
be the one who was
hanging on the outside.

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:28.720
And I just knew how bad
that felt. So I just

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.600
wanted to give them
a leg up if I could.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.880
ENRICO BIANCO: That's a
really interesting point.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:39.490
Because there's sort of this
meme that autistics do not have

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:44.870
or cannot express empathy,
coming from the theory of mind

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:48.820
research from Simon Baron-Cohen
as well as other stuff that

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.870
derived from that.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:54.360
Could you say a little bit
more about that, actually,

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.630
like, how do you feel
about that statement,

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:58.855
that autistics do
not have empathy?

00:14:58.855 --> 00:15:01.670
Do you think that's true?

00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:04.360
GEORGIA LYON: I really do
not think that's true at all.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:08.050
I think that many autistic
people are actually

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:09.140
very empathetic.

00:15:09.140 --> 00:15:11.570
And the main problem
is not so much

00:15:11.570 --> 00:15:16.490
that they lack certain neurons
or certain ways of thinking

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.340
as much as, actually, those
neurons or ways of thinking

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.670
are hyperactive.

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:25.420
So it causes a state where
the person just shuts down,

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:28.470
because they're so overwhelmed
by sensory input or emotions

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:31.219
that they just can't
express it in the ways

00:15:31.219 --> 00:15:33.385
that most people would think
of as being empathetic.

00:15:33.385 --> 00:15:36.260
But, I think, really,
when you're inside of it,

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:38.440
when you feel
what's going on, you

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.267
realize that you feel
other people's emotions

00:15:41.267 --> 00:15:42.600
and that they are affecting you.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.610
You just can't convey that well.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:46.855
I just remember, as
a kid, sometimes,

00:15:46.855 --> 00:15:49.240
I would almost be like
an aerial for emotions,

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.420
where if I would go to,
like, the class, for example,

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.500
and everyone there
was feeling tired,

00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.500
even if I entered the classroom
feeling energetic, by the time

00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.517
I left, I would
feel tired or sad

00:15:59.517 --> 00:16:01.100
or whatever other
people were feeling.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.836
So, no, I don't think it's true.

00:16:02.836 --> 00:16:04.210
I think it's almost
the opposite,

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.751
where you have to
learn how to, like,

00:16:05.751 --> 00:16:08.495
separate yourself from others
sometimes in order to function.

00:16:08.495 --> 00:16:09.370
ENRICO BIANCO: Right.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:13.280
And there is something to that,
the so-called overwhelming

00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.220
world theory.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:19.470
So in your book, you
describe yourself

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.530
as an empowered autistic.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:24.390
For those that haven't had
a chance to read the book,

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.884
tell us a bit more
about what that means.

00:16:26.884 --> 00:16:28.300
GEORGIA LYON: To
me, what it means

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.040
is that, while you
have autism, you

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:34.220
can still lead a very
successful, fulfilling life

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.820
just as you are.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.365
You don't need to change
anything about yourself

00:16:38.365 --> 00:16:39.240
or the way you think.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.562
And, you know, obviously,
there may be some areas where

00:16:42.562 --> 00:16:44.270
life will be a little
bit more difficult.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:48.075
But you'll also have the
ability to see things

00:16:48.075 --> 00:16:50.470
in a unique way that will add
a lot of richness and depth

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.550
to your life, if you're
an empowered autistic,

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:55.550
I think, and share that with
the rest of the world, as well.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:56.960
ENRICO BIANCO: Right.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.340
And what advice would
you offer to autistics

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:03.360
that want to empower
themselves or their allies?

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.460
GEORGIA LYON: Well, to autistics
who want to empower themselves,

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:11.147
I would say, I
think, be flexible.

00:17:11.147 --> 00:17:12.980
I know this is not
something a lot of people

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.938
necessarily say in the
neurodiversity movement.

00:17:14.938 --> 00:17:18.050
But just learning how to
think like a neurotypical

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:19.839
can actually be really useful.

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:23.859
I think that some
autistic people

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:26.839
are afraid that if they learn
too much about neurotypicals,

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:29.790
if they, you know, do,
quote unquote, "therapy,"

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.921
that they will somehow lose the
autistic aspects of themselves.

00:17:32.921 --> 00:17:34.170
And I don't think that's true.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.860
I think it's just
simply opening your mind

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:40.022
to a new way of
thinking, not necessarily

00:17:40.022 --> 00:17:41.730
a better way of
thinking, just a new one.

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:47.286
And it'll give you more
options for how you think.

00:17:47.286 --> 00:17:48.910
The way I like to
describe it to people

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:50.870
is it's like learning
a second language.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:52.910
You don't forget
your first language.

00:17:52.910 --> 00:17:55.570
You just have a
greater vocabulary now

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:57.600
to speak with more people.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.110
And so I think that
autistic people

00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.568
should be open to learning how
to think like neurotypicals,

00:18:01.568 --> 00:18:03.440
learning about
certain forms of body

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:07.480
language, facial
expressions, and whatnot.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.630
And, I think, in
terms of allies,

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:13.357
I think the allies,
too, have to be

00:18:13.357 --> 00:18:14.690
flexible but in a different way.

00:18:14.690 --> 00:18:16.820
They have to have
the flexibility

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:19.560
to let autistic
people direct them.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.117
Because some autistic people
will want to learn more about

00:18:23.117 --> 00:18:23.700
neurotypicals.

00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:26.140
And some will just want to
be themselves as they are.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:30.244
And I think that if an autistic
person expresses the desire

00:18:30.244 --> 00:18:31.660
to learn more about
neurotypicals,

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.490
their allies should
help them do so.

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:35.612
But if they just want
to be as they are now,

00:18:35.612 --> 00:18:38.195
their allies should also respect
that wish and let them do so.

00:18:38.195 --> 00:18:40.610
ENRICO BIANCO: That's really
fascinating, actually,

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.380
and kind of uncanny.

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:45.240
Because I know that I've
described being autistic

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.020
internally as being
sort of like a learner

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.514
of a foreign language.

00:18:51.514 --> 00:18:52.930
And a good friend
of mine actually

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:55.700
put it really well when he
said that being autistic

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.590
is like being a foreigner
in every culture.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:02.670
And it really feels like
it's true sometimes.

00:19:02.670 --> 00:19:05.000
Speaking of that,
actually, how does it

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.700
feel to interact with
other autistics, as opposed

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.722
to interacting with the
neurologically typical?

00:19:12.722 --> 00:19:14.500
GEORGIA LYON: I notice
slight differences.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:17.310
But to be perfectly
honest, I think

00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:18.910
there are more similarities.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.454
I don't actually notice
a lot of differences.

00:19:21.454 --> 00:19:23.620
I notice, when I'm interacting
with autistic people,

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:25.730
there can be slightly
less eye contact.

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.430
Or sometimes, they'll
have their stims,

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:29.970
you know, rocking in a
chair or flapping a bit.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:34.510
But, honestly, I feel
like there is just

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.620
a lot of diversity in the
neurotypical community,

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:38.870
too, more than most
people, I think, realize.

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.590
And there is also
a lot of diversity

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:41.670
on the autism spectrum.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.810
So really, when it
comes down to it,

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.260
the interactions are more
determined by the individual

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.036
than their diagnosis.

00:19:49.036 --> 00:19:49.940
ENRICO BIANCO: Right.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:54.350
And what, I don't know if
I would call them coping

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:56.400
mechanisms or
adaptations, have you

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.270
learned to make when interacting
with the neurologically

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:00.622
typical?

00:20:00.622 --> 00:20:02.080
GEORGIA LYON:
Personally, for me, I

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.990
have my hand grabbing-- I guess,
you can't really see it here,

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:08.480
but I kind of often go like
this in class or wherever--

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.040
to stop myself from
flapping, because that helps.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.280
Because sometimes I don't want
to be flapping everywhere.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.760
Or I kind of have learned
to very consciously make

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.270
eye contact with people.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:22.850
Like right now, for
example, I'm not

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.734
doing the typical stage
thing, where you just

00:20:24.734 --> 00:20:26.400
look at the back
curtain and you pretend

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.060
that you're making eye
contact with everyone

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.410
by secretly looking over them.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:34.350
I'm actually kind of looking
at everyone in the audience.

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:36.630
And then, I think,
the other big one

00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.060
is just that, if I'm
not sure, I observe

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:40.450
before I enter a situation.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.967
ENRICO BIANCO: I think that's
actually pretty interesting.

00:20:42.967 --> 00:20:45.300
Because I remember, I was
talking with another autistic.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:46.940
And she looked at me.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:50.300
And she said, do you think that
I'm looking you in the eyes?

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.496
And I said, I think so.

00:20:53.496 --> 00:20:54.620
I think that's eye contact.

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:59.330
And she said, actually,
I'm looking right here,

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:00.330
is what she told me.

00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:06.510
And this was her mechanism for
giving eye contact, or at least

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.977
the perception of it, but
without becoming overwhelmed.

00:21:09.977 --> 00:21:12.060
GEORGIA LYON: Well,
personally, for me, I actually

00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.300
do give eye contact.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.256
Because with my
other sensory issues,

00:21:15.256 --> 00:21:16.630
I actually find
that it helps me.

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:19.339
So if I can't hear someone,
looking at their face

00:21:19.339 --> 00:21:20.880
and just seeing how
their mouth moves

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.710
can actually be very useful.

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.210
So I think that a
lot of my teachers

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:27.010
think that I'm really just
paying very attentive attention

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:29.260
in class, when really I just
want to hear what they're

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:30.470
saying, like everyone else.

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:33.360
But everyone else can kind
of look away and be, like,

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.360
whereas I have to actually
look at them in order

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:36.780
to kind of understand
what they're

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:39.195
saying with my sensory issues.

00:21:39.195 --> 00:21:41.770
ENRICO BIANCO: So
in her TED Talk,

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:43.810
actually, or in a
number of her talks,

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:46.170
Temple Grandin talks about
different types of thinkers

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.620
on the autism spectrum.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:50.700
She herself identifies
as a visual thinker.

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:53.506
As she puts it, she has
Google for Images in her head.

00:21:53.506 --> 00:21:54.380
GEORGIA LYON: Um, hm.

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:57.220
ENRICO BIANCO: She also talks
about the math and language

00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:59.890
types, who are really good
at perceiving patterns.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:03.081
Where do you think you fall
within those classifications?

00:22:03.081 --> 00:22:05.080
GEORGIA LYON: You know,
it's really interesting.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.400
Because, I think,
when I was younger,

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.110
I fell in more with
the visual thinkers.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:12.910
But around age seven or eight,
I actually did a lot of therapy,

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:16.010
because I was having a lot of
issues learning how to read.

00:22:16.010 --> 00:22:18.130
So I think, through all
that intensive therapy,

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:22.020
I really developed a lot
of strong neural networks

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.390
for language thinking, too.

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:26.600
So now, I don't think I
neatly fit into either box.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.844
I'm sort of a
mumbo-jumbo of both.

00:22:29.844 --> 00:22:31.260
ENRICO BIANCO:
That's interesting.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:33.260
Because I was going to
ask, actually, if you had

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:37.710
noticed your ways of thinking
changing over the years.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:38.859
Have you?

00:22:38.859 --> 00:22:40.650
GEORGIA LYON: Yeah, I
think I've definitely

00:22:40.650 --> 00:22:42.941
become a bit more of a language
thinker over the years.

00:22:42.941 --> 00:22:46.910
I never quite got into the
whole mathematic thing.

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:50.030
Like, math still doesn't really
work with my brain in general.

00:22:50.030 --> 00:22:54.700
But I definitely have become
much stronger with language,

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.060
a little bit less strong
in terms of visual skills,

00:22:57.060 --> 00:22:59.495
though I still have
decent ones, I'd say.

00:22:59.495 --> 00:23:02.160
ENRICO BIANCO: So your
book, "How to be Human,"

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.210
it's not just a simple diary.

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:06.667
It also includes your artwork.

00:23:06.667 --> 00:23:08.250
Tell us a bit more
about that artwork.

00:23:08.250 --> 00:23:09.830
What does that mean to you?

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.190
And what meaning does it hold?

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:14.340
And how does it fit into the
subject matter of the book?

00:23:14.340 --> 00:23:16.509
GEORGIA LYON: The
artwork in that book

00:23:16.509 --> 00:23:18.050
was a lot of the
artwork I originally

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:20.810
did to understand social
skills and my own emotions.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:24.320
So it's just very
valuable to me,

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:26.680
because that was really when
I had my big breakthrough.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:30.230
I feel like before that
I'd been sort of isolated

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:32.710
in my own kind of
glass ball of autism.

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:34.840
And that artwork was
really the pickax

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.730
which allowed me to
kind of break out.

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.800
Yeah, that's basically the
meaning it holds to me and why.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.852
That was why it was so
helpful and whatnot.

00:23:48.852 --> 00:23:50.560
ENRICO BIANCO: That's
really fascinating.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.540
Actually, I'd love it
if you could elaborate

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:53.650
a little bit more on that.

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:58.560
In what ways did your art help
you to sort of learn to, quote,

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.211
"be human"?

00:24:00.211 --> 00:24:02.459
GEORGIA LYON: I
think it helped me,

00:24:02.459 --> 00:24:05.000
as I've said before, because it
allowed me to slow everything

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.120
down and kind of take
it at my own pace,

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.520
instead of having to be
thrown into the middle

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:13.200
of a social interaction
that was too complex for me

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:15.840
to understand while it
was going lightning fast.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.460
But I think it also just
allowed me to get more in touch

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:25.095
with my own emotions, too, and
kind of see that I had them

00:24:25.095 --> 00:24:26.470
and that I could
understand them,

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:29.830
as opposed to it
just being something

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:31.855
that was foreign and complex.

00:24:31.855 --> 00:24:34.315
ENRICO BIANCO: And do
you still draw today?

00:24:34.315 --> 00:24:37.000
GEORGIA LYON: I draw a lot less
than I used to, I must admit.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.020
Generally, I write more.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.280
ENRICO BIANCO: So
in what ways do you

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.360
feel you express yourself now?

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.190
GEORGIA LYON: I express
myself much more

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:49.070
verbally, I would say, whether
it's through my writing

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:52.320
or talking with my friends.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.600
I mean, I do still like to draw.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.930
But unfortunately,
I do not generally

00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:58.530
make as much time
for it as I should.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.630
So if I do need
to express myself,

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:03.920
it generally is with words,
now that I have a stronger

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:06.540
understanding of
what words I can

00:25:06.540 --> 00:25:10.585
use to actualize my emotional
vocabulary, shall we say.

00:25:10.585 --> 00:25:11.460
ENRICO BIANCO: Right.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:13.620
Tell us a little bit more
about that, actually.

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.620
Like, how did the
writing and the drawing

00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:20.705
help you to sort of navigate
your own emotional state?

00:25:20.705 --> 00:25:24.790
GEORGIA LYON: I think, as
I said before, it allowed

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:31.680
me to express kind of abstract
thoughts in concrete ways,

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.990
especially the drawing aspect.

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.840
And then, in terms of
just writing the book,

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.720
I think that allowed me to
really think about my life's

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:43.385
experiences as a whole and see a
way to define autism for myself

00:25:43.385 --> 00:25:44.140
more.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:47.494
Because, as probably
many of you know,

00:25:47.494 --> 00:25:50.395
certainly, there
is a DSM-- I don't

00:25:50.395 --> 00:25:53.880
know-- -5 definition for
autism, the diagnostic criteria,

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.690
whatever that is.

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:59.810
And while I think it helps
to create groups and then

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:01.510
deliver some help
to those groups,

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:05.010
it doesn't allow for much,
kind of, individual depth.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:07.030
It doesn't really have
the human aspect to it.

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:08.560
So I think writing
my book allowed

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.810
me to see the human aspect
in autism more in myself

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:14.432
and then later on for others.

00:26:14.432 --> 00:26:16.230
ENRICO BIANCO: Right.

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:22.940
So "How to be Human" is, in a
way, a children's book, right?

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:27.320
But do you expect that
there's something to take away

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.150
from the book for
an adult audience,

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.470
like, say, the one that we
have here for this talk?

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:32.800
GEORGIA LYON: Oh, definitely.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.010
I think the takeaway
for pretty much everyone

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.160
is that we're all
different, and we all kind

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.680
of struggle in different areas.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.630
But, fundamentally, that's
part of what makes us human,

00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:44.240
and we shouldn't
be ashamed of that.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.630
And we should help
each other with it

00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:49.280
and learn from each other's
experiences, instead of,

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.474
I guess, shutting
each other down.

00:26:52.474 --> 00:26:56.390
ENRICO BIANCO: That's
very much true, actually.

00:26:56.390 --> 00:27:01.730
Do feel that you still have
difficulty making and keeping

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:04.410
friendships and professional
networking relationships

00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.362
and things like that?

00:27:06.362 --> 00:27:08.820
GEORGIA LYON: Well, I don't do
much professional networking

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:09.320
at 18.

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.970
But, yeah.

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:14.270
ENRICO BIANCO: It's never
too late or early to start.

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:15.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:17.376
GEORGIA LYON: Certainly.

00:27:17.376 --> 00:27:19.110
But, no, I don't.

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:21.670
I think now I
actually have a lot

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:25.930
of long-lasting friendships,
the longest of which

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.650
is my friend who I've been
friends with for 15 years now.

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:32.616
So, no, I really don't.

00:27:32.616 --> 00:27:34.740
In fact, I'd say I just
have more difficulty making

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:35.310
new friends.

00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:36.930
Because, generally,
in new situations,

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:39.770
there is a lot of more
sensory information to take in

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:41.077
and a lot more to learn.

00:27:41.077 --> 00:27:43.160
So that's still where I
kind of struggle the most.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.743
But in terms of
maintaining, once I've

00:27:44.743 --> 00:27:49.490
learned how to recognize facial
patterns and certain body

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:53.012
language things in a person,
I'm pretty good at figuring out

00:27:53.012 --> 00:27:55.470
what the person is feeling and
maintaining their friendship

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:56.292
if I care to do so.

00:27:56.292 --> 00:27:58.500
ENRICO BIANCO: And tell us
a bit more about yourself.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.416
Like, what do you like
to do with your leisure

00:28:00.416 --> 00:28:02.150
time, hobbies, and so on?

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:04.380
GEORGIA LYON: Well,
I like martial arts.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.180
I did tae kwon do for
about seven years.

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:07.930
AUDIENCE: Woo-hoo!

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:08.603
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:08.603 --> 00:28:10.686
ENRICO BIANCO: [LAUGHTER]
I'd say we've got a fan.

00:28:10.686 --> 00:28:12.760
GEORGIA LYON: Woo!

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.483
Those who kick together
stick together.

00:28:14.483 --> 00:28:15.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:15.250 --> 00:28:16.330
ENRICO BIANCO: I didn't
know that was a saying.

00:28:16.330 --> 00:28:17.121
That's really cool.

00:28:17.121 --> 00:28:19.540
GEORGIA LYON: Well, it is.

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.485
But now, let's see.

00:28:20.485 --> 00:28:22.860
Now, I'm doing karate, though,
just for a change of pace.

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.850
And that's also really fun.

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:29.427
I like swimming, as well,
just kind of casual swimming.

00:28:29.427 --> 00:28:30.760
I started that when I was three.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.500
Because, apparently,
I jumped into a pool

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.660
before I knew how to swim.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:39.810
And my parents can give you the
full story if you wished here.

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:44.480
But then I also
like to read a lot.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:48.210
And, let's see,
what other things?

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:51.389
Yeah, and social, I
guess, justice issues

00:28:51.389 --> 00:28:53.180
are really interesting
to me at the moment,

00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:55.950
as well, just everything
from neurodiversity,

00:28:55.950 --> 00:29:00.180
to women's issues,
to issues including

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:06.335
racial minorities, the LGBTQ
community, all of that stuff.

00:29:06.335 --> 00:29:11.020
ENRICO BIANCO: So what else do
you do in the area of advocacy

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.950
for autism or for other related
social justice or disability

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:16.160
issues?

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.600
GEORGIA LYON: So while I
was still in high school,

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.970
during my final semester
there, my school

00:29:21.970 --> 00:29:26.520
founded this club called the
PSA, which was the Pinewood

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.560
Social Awareness club.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.580
And I did a lot of
advocacy with them.

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.520
And we had an assembly
just to generally educate

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.800
on learning differences
and racial issues

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:41.690
and women's issues and a lot
of other issues, as well.

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:43.830
I also just do a
lot of interviews

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:48.100
to help advocate for autism
and autism awareness.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.390
And, yeah, I would say
that's about it so far.

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:53.095
But I hope to do
more in the future.

00:29:53.095 --> 00:29:54.830
ENRICO BIANCO: And
who would you say

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:58.132
are your biggest influences?

00:29:58.132 --> 00:30:01.400
GEORGIA LYON: I would say
probably my family and friends,

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.520
so my parents, the
people I've known

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:07.610
for many years such as Shelah
and my other autism therapists,

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:11.390
and just many of the wonderful
friends I've made along the way

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:13.905
through high school and whatnot.

00:30:13.905 --> 00:30:15.760
ENRICO BIANCO: And
anybody within, say,

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:21.595
the wider autism community,
authors, people who've spoken?

00:30:21.595 --> 00:30:23.770
GEORGIA LYON: I
really like Carly,

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:26.130
if you've ever had a chance
to see any of her videos.

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:29.836
She I think was originally
diagnosed as being,

00:30:29.836 --> 00:30:31.210
quote unquote,
"low functioning."

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:34.200
But, it turned
out, she really did

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.870
have a very great understanding
of the world and much depth

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:38.570
to her thoughts.

00:30:38.570 --> 00:30:41.730
And she has this wonderful video
called "Carly's Cafe," which

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.960
I think explains sensory
overload basically better

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:47.230
than anything I've ever seen.

00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:50.540
And she is a wonderful
person, I think,

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:52.860
that I like to
model myself off of.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.140
ENRICO BIANCO: That's a
really good video, actually.

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:57.360
And I have read "Carly's
Voice," and I highly

00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.830
recommend it to everyone here.

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:04.700
I think there's a lot of,
maybe, controversy around Carly,

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:09.340
some people who may be on
the fence about whether they

00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:11.820
believe that she is
actually expressing herself

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.300
through her writing.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.470
But I think that if you
look past all of that

00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:20.960
and just let what she's
saying-- in her posts,

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.470
in her book, in her
videos-- speak for itself,

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:27.990
it says a lot about the
experience of being autistic.

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:29.200
So do you still write?

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.860
Are you maybe thinking
of writing another book?

00:31:31.860 --> 00:31:33.350
GEORGIA LYON: Yes,
though I think

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:35.099
it will be in a different
genre this time.

00:31:35.099 --> 00:31:37.980
I'm thinking of entering into
fiction and kind of exploring

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.620
some other writing
ideas I've had.

00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:41.350
I don't know necessarily
if I'll write

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:44.259
another book about my
life anytime soon, though.

00:31:44.259 --> 00:31:45.800
ENRICO BIANCO: I
was wondering if you

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.890
have any advice for autistics
in the workplace who

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:52.500
may be having trouble fitting
in with their working group

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.350
or having issues
with their manager.

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:59.270
How would you advise that those
people advocate for themselves

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:01.180
and get those problems solved?

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:06.120
GEORGIA LYON: Well, I would say
that, if they are in a position

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.690
to do so, should be honest about
having autism, first of all.

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:14.270
I think that that shows
management and other employees

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.650
that you are confident
and self-aware, which

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:20.430
are very attractive qualities
to most employers, I would say.

00:32:20.430 --> 00:32:24.810
And I think that
they just need to let

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:27.950
other people know when something
is not going their way.

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:29.950
They don't have to
necessarily be rude about it.

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:32.100
They don't have to
interrupt what's going on.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.630
But just later talking
with their manager

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:36.920
or other employees
to try to come up

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.720
with strategies to cope
better in the future,

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:45.200
or even just having the
ability to maybe break

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.090
for five minutes
in a quiet space

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:51.450
where they can decompress, I
think would be very helpful.

00:32:51.450 --> 00:32:53.200
And then, in terms of
the other employees,

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.189
I think that they
just need to be very

00:32:55.189 --> 00:32:56.480
clear about what they're doing.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.905
They need to make sure that
they have clearly set guidelines

00:33:00.905 --> 00:33:02.000
and expectations.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.510
Because I can say personally,
from my experiences,

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:08.500
that autistics are not very good
at determining what you want

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:09.860
from very murky instructions.

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.568
I know that it's a
struggle for everyone.

00:33:11.568 --> 00:33:14.874
But I think it's more so
for people on the spectrum.

00:33:14.874 --> 00:33:16.290
ENRICO BIANCO:
It's kind of funny,

00:33:16.290 --> 00:33:18.940
because navigating
ambiguity is actually, like,

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:22.960
part of our job description as
software engineers at Google.

00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.430
And it feels weird
sometimes, like being

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:30.270
expected to do something that
I know that we're so weak at.

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:32.366
But we try our best, right?

00:33:32.366 --> 00:33:33.240
GEORGIA LYON: Indeed.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.079
I mean, I don't think
that navigating ambiguity

00:33:36.079 --> 00:33:37.620
is necessarily a
strength for anyone.

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.830
It's just more difficult for
those of us on the spectrum.

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:46.230
So definitely, I think
that's one of the issues

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:49.320
that people who are neurotypical
can relate to the most,

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.485
I think.

00:33:50.485 --> 00:33:53.395
ENRICO BIANCO:
That's a true point.

00:33:53.395 --> 00:33:55.477
GEORGIA LYON: Yeah.

00:33:55.477 --> 00:33:57.560
And then I think the other
big thing for employees

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:02.150
is just, yeah, to
be very flexible

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:03.960
and be willing to listen.

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:07.230
Because, I think, when
you're in a majority,

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.060
such as the
neurotypical majority,

00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:13.120
you kind of think everyone
else thinks like you.

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.320
And that's not always true.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:17.570
And it's sometimes hard to
imagine anything different.

00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:20.164
But I think you just have to
be open-minded about that.

00:34:20.164 --> 00:34:22.080
ENRICO BIANCO: That's
all really, really good.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:22.500
Thank you.

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.708
That's actually a lot of
stuff for me to think about,

00:34:24.708 --> 00:34:28.170
as I continue to advise
the Special Needs Network

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:30.850
and the company as a
whole in neurodiversity

00:34:30.850 --> 00:34:32.469
in the workplace.

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:35.090
And with that, I've definitely
run to the end of the questions

00:34:35.090 --> 00:34:35.980
that I had.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:38.639
And so if anybody
in the audience

00:34:38.639 --> 00:34:40.730
has questions for
Georgia, I believe

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:42.846
we have a mic up
on the podium here.

00:34:42.846 --> 00:34:44.929
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for coming and talking

00:34:44.929 --> 00:34:46.460
about your experiences.

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.729
Any advice for parents
of autistic children?

00:34:49.729 --> 00:34:53.600
GEORGIA LYON: Oh, I guess
my advice to parents

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.830
would be the same advice as I
gave to just allies in general,

00:34:56.830 --> 00:34:59.300
which is just to kind of
be flexible and see what

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:02.400
your child wants and needs.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:06.000
I think, don't be
afraid, though,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.499
to do what you think is
right for your child also

00:35:09.499 --> 00:35:10.040
is a big one.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.370
Because I think
some parents feel

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:14.530
as if they have to
follow what other doctors

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:15.730
or therapists say.

00:35:15.730 --> 00:35:18.190
Because those are the, quote
unquote, "professionals."

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:21.400
But, probably, you
know your child

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.980
better than any
professional really

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:26.690
can with just X number
of hours of assessment.

00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:29.120
So you have to do what
you feel, I think,

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.370
is right, in many cases.

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:33.730
Because while their
people are trying to help,

00:35:33.730 --> 00:35:36.590
they just don't have
the same understanding

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:39.230
of your life and your
child's life that you do.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:42.530
ENRICO BIANCO: So building on
that a little bit, in what ways

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:46.512
did your parents support
you as you were growing up?

00:35:46.512 --> 00:35:49.460
GEORGIA LYON: I know they
were very important in helping

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:51.500
to find the
therapists that I have

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.270
or have had throughout my life.

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:57.680
For example, I know we started
with some just general kind

00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.501
of social skills therapists.

00:35:59.501 --> 00:36:01.000
They weren't
necessarily hurting me,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.170
but they weren't
necessarily helping

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:05.140
me develop my social
skills any further.

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.990
So after a couple
months, they just

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:10.730
changed course, even though
those therapists were

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:14.550
from some program that did
ABA, which was considered

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:16.400
the mainstream at
the time and, I

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.550
think, actually still is
considered the mainstream

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:20.600
treatment for autism.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.740
But instead, my parents
switched over to Shelah

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:27.242
and another therapist
named Sarah, who did not

00:36:27.242 --> 00:36:28.450
do as many mainstream things.

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:32.110
They did more kind of
Greenspan and play time,

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:35.200
which was actually
more beneficial for me

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.240
because it was more dynamic
and more about being

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:40.300
flexible and learning
patterns in social situations

00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:43.790
quickly and learning how to kind
of be creative along with it

00:36:43.790 --> 00:36:45.380
and play pretend.

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:46.950
So I think that
was very important.

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:48.950
ENRICO BIANCO: Something
like social role-play--

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:49.700
GEORGIA LYON: Yes.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.344
ENRICO BIANCO: --or guidance
in social situations?

00:36:52.344 --> 00:36:54.260
Yeah, I remember there
was something like that

00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:55.480
when I was a child, as well.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.900
My mother put me
into this program

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.490
that brought children together.

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:03.340
And we either role-played
social situations,

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:06.130
or we just had guidance when
interacting with each other,

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:10.720
as to how to, I guess, socialize
better with each other.

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:16.482
And that was really actually
valuable for me growing up.

00:37:16.482 --> 00:37:20.090
AUDIENCE: You spoke a
lot about things outside

00:37:20.090 --> 00:37:22.250
of your education that
have really helped you,

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:24.601
things like artwork
and some special people

00:37:24.601 --> 00:37:26.600
in your lives, your parents
being so supportive.

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.195
But I was wondering
about successes

00:37:28.195 --> 00:37:30.190
that you have had
in the classroom,

00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:33.670
specifically with teachers
or maybe programs at school.

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.200
I'm nor sure specifically
where you go to school.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:42.690
But are their things,
like programs,

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:46.950
that have helped you grow
as an individual or just

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:48.856
through education?

00:37:48.856 --> 00:37:52.100
GEORGIA LYON: You know,
that's honestly hard to say.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:56.600
I was homeschooled from
first grade to seventh grade.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.620
So I would say that's why
a lot of my experiences

00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:03.030
came from sort of outside an
established school program.

00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:05.770
Because we sort of created
our own school curriculum

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:07.310
during those years.

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:10.630
And then, by the time I
went back to kind of, right,

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:14.510
more of a regular form of
school in eighth grade,

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:17.124
my autism, while still
there, wasn't preventing me

00:38:17.124 --> 00:38:19.290
from learning in the same
way as it had in the past,

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:21.320
so I didn't
necessarily participate

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.280
in a lot of special
programs or even

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:26.040
get accommodations in middle
school or high school.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.670
So I don't honestly know.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:32.260
But in terms of successes I've
had just inside the classroom,

00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:36.930
I would say, I generally made
As in most of my high school

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:38.330
classes.

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:41.950
I took some AP courses
and did pretty well

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:43.400
on the AP tests in general.

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.604
And I got along well with
most of my teachers, I think.

00:38:46.604 --> 00:38:48.770
I can't actually think of
any teachers that hated me

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:50.811
in high school, so that's
probably an achievement

00:38:50.811 --> 00:38:51.970
in and of itself.

00:38:51.970 --> 00:38:54.810
ENRICO BIANCO: That's
definitely a positive.

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:58.280
And were group projects
a lot of a problem?

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.740
GEORGIA LYON:
Group projects were

00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:05.310
kind of a logistical
problem, but not so much

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:08.500
with the social skills.

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:10.550
It was just basically
that I define hell

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:12.850
as coordinating more than
two people's schedules to get

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:15.300
together at the same time.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.790
But the social skills
part was actually fine .

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:20.130
I'd say, in fact, in some
of my group projects,

00:39:20.130 --> 00:39:22.710
that I was more socially
and emotionally mature

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:24.880
than other people in them.

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:27.060
So it was mostly just
about not getting caught up

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:31.914
in whatever their drama
was when such issues arose.

00:39:31.914 --> 00:39:35.690
AUDIENCE: As a quick
extension, so a lot of us--

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:39.551
I'd say all of us in this room--
went to school a while ago,

00:39:39.551 --> 00:39:40.050
right?

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:44.230
We were in high school, you
know, decades potentially ago,

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:45.760
depending on who you talk to.

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:49.671
But I was wondering if you think
that, in the event that you

00:39:49.671 --> 00:39:51.920
do need accommodations, or
maybe friends of yours that

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.550
do need accommodations,
do you think that you

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:55.770
have everything you need?

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:57.279
I think a lot of
us probably felt

00:39:57.279 --> 00:39:59.820
that we didn't always have the
accommodations that we wanted.

00:39:59.820 --> 00:40:04.116
And I was just kind of wondering
about the way schools work now.

00:40:04.116 --> 00:40:05.740
GEORGIA LYON: You
know, there are still

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:08.130
definitely issues with that.

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:11.240
I mean, I can say, I know,
actually, you're right.

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.990
I do have friends who
have accommodations.

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:14.890
One of my closest friends
in high school did.

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:19.890
And, you know, I'd say
overall it was OK for her.

00:40:19.890 --> 00:40:22.790
But there were some kind of
hiccups or awkward moments.

00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:26.400
Like I know, for example,
on some standardized tests,

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:29.310
they don't give you
necessarily breaks

00:40:29.310 --> 00:40:30.440
if you have accommodations.

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:33.340
So you have to really know
how to pace your own time.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:37.510
And often people don't,
so they can end up

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:39.340
with kind of awkward
amounts of time.

00:40:39.340 --> 00:40:42.140
Like they'll take 20 minutes on
one section of, like, the ACT.

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.830
And then they wind
up with an hour

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:44.800
at the end of the whole thing.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.280
And they're like, well,
now I have an hour

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.946
to do a section that's
really only going

00:40:47.946 --> 00:40:49.300
to take me like 25 minutes.

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.860
So there's hiccups like that.

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:55.102
Or there's just people
who don't, I guess,

00:40:55.102 --> 00:40:56.185
understand accommodations.

00:40:56.185 --> 00:40:58.300
You know, some people
still definitely think

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:01.790
that, if you get accommodations,
you're just getting a leg up

00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:03.020
on everyone else.

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:06.200
And so they'll put
you down for that.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:09.090
Or, you know,
teachers won't really

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:11.670
follow the accommodations
they're supposed to give.

00:41:11.670 --> 00:41:15.760
So, I mean, I think it's
heading in the right direction.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.240
But there's definitely still
some progress to be made.

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.000
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.340
So do you feel that today,
your autism, because of it,

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:28.120
do you view things or people
or events in the world

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.700
differently from other people?

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:37.150
GEORGIA LYON: I think sometimes
yes, but sometimes no.

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:37.740
I don't know.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.255
It's very hard to say.

00:41:39.255 --> 00:41:40.630
As I said before,
I think there's

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:43.320
a lot of kind of
diversity amongst people

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.370
who aren't autistic.

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:47.620
Because even if they're
not neurotypical,

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:51.630
they could still have other
so-called differences,

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:57.170
ADHD, emotional
disorders, et cetera.

00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:00.015
So it's hard to say, I think.

00:42:00.015 --> 00:42:04.030
In general, I view things in
the same way as a lot of people

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:06.920
my age kind of or who have
gone through similar life's

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.290
experiences.

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:10.820
But I think the big one
still for me is just

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:11.790
sensory processing.

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:15.000
That's really where I think
different in the way I perceive

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.350
the world from a lot of
people, especially when it

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:18.050
comes coughing.

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:21.660
That's one sound that really
drives me absolutely nuts.

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:24.020
So I think, you know, most
people, if they enter a room

00:42:24.020 --> 00:42:26.576
and there's someone
coughing, they don't care.

00:42:26.576 --> 00:42:27.950
And for me, I'm
just, like, can I

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:29.783
get out of here as soon
as possible, please?

00:42:29.783 --> 00:42:32.777
And I'll try to, kind
of, do so if I can.

00:42:32.777 --> 00:42:34.610
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any advice for someone

00:42:34.610 --> 00:42:37.210
who's making, say,
online products that

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:40.160
could make it easier for an
autistic person to access?

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:41.630
Because around
here, we're big fans

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:43.060
of making information
universally

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.450
accessible and useful.

00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:45.510
GEORGIA LYON: Oh, gosh.

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:46.820
I don't really know, honestly.

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:52.980
I mean, I think that a
lot of autistic people

00:42:52.980 --> 00:42:56.590
are quite savvy on the internet,
to be perfectly honest,

00:42:56.590 --> 00:42:59.590
not to buy into the nerdy
engineer stereotype too much.

00:42:59.590 --> 00:43:02.280
But I think that's definitely
a large portion of those who

00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:03.680
are on the autistic spectrum.

00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:06.520
And so, I mean, I
think probably if they

00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:08.940
want the resource, they
already know how to find it,

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:13.805
would be my big piece
of advice on that.

00:43:13.805 --> 00:43:16.074
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for talking today.

00:43:16.074 --> 00:43:17.490
It's been really,
really wonderful

00:43:17.490 --> 00:43:19.940
to hear your insights.

00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:23.790
I wondered if you had
anything to say to how society

00:43:23.790 --> 00:43:26.500
as a whole views autism?

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.640
So, of course,
recently it's been

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:32.670
something that's been very
much talked about and not

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:36.260
just in the research
community and in society

00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.510
in general in an innocent way.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:39.884
But there have been parents
who have been not vaccinating

00:43:39.884 --> 00:43:42.376
their kids because they
think that this is how

00:43:42.376 --> 00:43:44.020
I am going to give them autism.

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:48.980
There have been a lot of
similar paranoias and scares.

00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:56.250
And what would you say to
put people on a better path,

00:43:56.250 --> 00:43:57.585
I guess?

00:43:57.585 --> 00:43:59.330
GEORGIA LYON: I
guess what I would

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:04.680
say to that is I want them
to realize that autism is not

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.680
a tragedy in and of itself.

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:08.809
I think, for many
people, it really

00:44:08.809 --> 00:44:10.975
is just a different way of
thinking about the world.

00:44:16.844 --> 00:44:18.260
Well, one thing
I've noticed, too,

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.700
just in society in
general, is there

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.130
seems to be this
idea that if you

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:25.230
have autism that you're going
to be kind of extremely smart

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:26.790
but lacking in
empathy and unable

00:44:26.790 --> 00:44:30.560
to really socialize or want
to be with other people.

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:34.450
And I think people have to stop
perpetuating that stereotype.

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:36.530
It is really just not true.

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:40.810
I've seen it in so many
movies, so many TV shows.

00:44:40.810 --> 00:44:43.590
And I think it's starting to
really stick in people's minds,

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:47.210
just outside of the scientific
community or the community

00:44:47.210 --> 00:44:51.330
of people who actually
know people with autism.

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:54.830
And it's something I really
try to speak out against,

00:44:54.830 --> 00:44:58.760
for example, with movies
such as-- oh, what

00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:02.190
was it-- "The Imitation Game"
I thought kind of perpetuated

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:05.190
that stereotype a lot and
kind of got on my nerves.

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:10.620
But, I think, what
society in general

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:12.370
has to realize is that
there is a lot more

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:19.860
diversity on the autism
spectrum than anyone can really

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:20.740
describe, I think.

00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:23.150
Because each individual has
a very unique experience

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.740
with autism.

00:45:23.740 --> 00:45:26.070
There's no one-size-fits-all
for autism.

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:28.760
I mean, I just know,
even talking with Enrico,

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:32.010
even though we're both fairly
similar in our experiences,

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:34.640
we definitely have areas
where we are different.

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:37.290
Like I have definitely more
sensory processing problems

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:38.300
it seems than he does.

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.800
Or, for example,
earlier, when we

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:42.550
were talking about
various sensory things,

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:44.007
I noticed all the sounds.

00:45:44.007 --> 00:45:46.590
But he was the one who noticed
the lights, which I didn't even

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:47.090
notice.

00:45:47.090 --> 00:45:50.650
So I think people
have to realize

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:58.010
that autistic
people aren't always

00:45:58.010 --> 00:46:00.370
the scientists kind of huddled
at the edge of the room.

00:46:00.370 --> 00:46:02.770
In fact, for me,
I would actually

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:05.000
say math and science
are kind of hard

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.460
and that verbal stuff is easier.

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:12.560
So I think that autistic
people themselves

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:14.940
have to be allowed to speak
more to their experiences.

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:19.730
And I guess those
should be considered

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:22.850
more valuable than whatever
movies portray autism

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:24.330
as being in general.

00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:27.980
ENRICO BIANCO: But expanding
on the portrayal of autism

00:46:27.980 --> 00:46:31.180
in the media, would
you say that there

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:34.192
are any examples, you can
think of, of doing it right?

00:46:34.192 --> 00:46:35.400
GEORGIA LYON: I would say so.

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:39.780
I mean, I think one movie I
saw that did it really well was

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:44.150
"Temple," which was based
off of Temple Grandin's life

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:45.820
experiences when
she was younger.

00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:49.880
And, I mean, I
think in that case,

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:52.670
it really showed her
with a lot of compassion.

00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:55.630
And it showed, definitely,
the challenges she faced.

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:57.460
It didn't try to downplay those.

00:46:57.460 --> 00:47:00.090
But it showed, too,
how she was really

00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:02.360
able to make very unique
contributions to the world,

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:03.920
not just because
she was autistic

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.990
but because she had this very
special passion for helping

00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:08.760
animals, as well.

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.990
And I think another example
I've seen-- it's fictional,

00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:14.240
but I think it's well done--
is "The Curious Incident

00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:15.490
of the Dog in the Night-Time."

00:47:15.490 --> 00:47:18.695
It certainly does feature
an autistic boy who

00:47:18.695 --> 00:47:20.240
is very into math and science.

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:24.900
But I think it also shows him
in a very human light and a very

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:25.710
compassionate one.

00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:30.800
And it shows how he's
really able to find,

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.080
I guess, independence,
in spite of all

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.804
of the challenges he faces.

00:47:34.804 --> 00:47:35.720
ENRICO BIANCO: Indeed.

00:47:35.720 --> 00:47:39.470
And I think it's actually
important to point out that

00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:44.440
this meme that, say, autistics
are sort of hyperintelligent

00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:48.710
in one particular field or
endeavour can sometimes be

00:47:48.710 --> 00:47:49.940
a little bit damaging.

00:47:49.940 --> 00:47:52.522
Because we're not all savants.

00:47:52.522 --> 00:47:53.980
GEORGIA LYON: No,
we really aren't.

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:55.313
ENRICO BIANCO: We really aren't.

00:47:55.313 --> 00:47:58.710
And so it can feel
kind of bad to have

00:47:58.710 --> 00:48:03.260
your value as a person
defined by whether you have

00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:07.960
this incredibly unique
and highly developed

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:11.620
talent, like as if,
for some reason,

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:16.770
maybe you are not so
valuable unless you have

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:19.820
savant-level talent
with numbers,

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:23.352
like Dustin Hoffman's
character in "Rain Man."

00:48:23.352 --> 00:48:25.980
Yeah, I caught you there.

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:30.230
And so I think it's important
that we add all of our stories

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:33.490
to this tapestry of
understanding about autism.

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:35.800
So that was definitely
a very good question.

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.217
Thank you for asking it, the
gentleman back there who did.

00:48:38.217 --> 00:48:40.591
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much
for sharing your experiences.

00:48:40.591 --> 00:48:42.330
I was wondering, going
back a little bit

00:48:42.330 --> 00:48:43.705
to the beginning
of the talk, you

00:48:43.705 --> 00:48:46.620
mentioned how finding a
label to describe yourself

00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:47.900
was useful in some ways.

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:50.420
But you've been very ambiguous
about your relationship

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:53.134
to labels in general
throughout this entire talk.

00:48:53.134 --> 00:48:54.800
Could you just comment
a little bit more

00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:57.930
on, like, the putting
people into bins

00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:01.450
of autism on the spectrum,
neurotypical, et cetera,

00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:03.835
and how that affects the
way you view the world?

00:49:03.835 --> 00:49:06.650
GEORGIA LYON: Yeah.

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:09.100
Well, I can say personally
what the label means to me.

00:49:09.100 --> 00:49:10.595
Like, personally,
I have no trouble

00:49:10.595 --> 00:49:13.820
with the label with autism
when referring to myself.

00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:18.410
But I think in terms of just
labels in the wider world,

00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:20.890
I think they're somewhat flawed
in many ways, I will say.

00:49:20.890 --> 00:49:22.870
Because as you were
talking about, you know,

00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:26.400
we have labels such as
neurotypical, autism, autism

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.710
spectrum.

00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:31.880
But those labels are,
I guess, often applied

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:33.632
in a very precise
way that actually

00:49:33.632 --> 00:49:34.840
doesn't help a lot of people.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.450
For example, I
know that, in order

00:49:37.450 --> 00:49:39.590
to be diagnosed with autism,
basically what they do

00:49:39.590 --> 00:49:40.750
is they give you a test.

00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:43.370
And if you get a score
above a certain number,

00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:44.160
you have autism.

00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.820
If it's below the
number, you don't.

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:48.650
Now, obviously, that
can be challenging.

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:51.060
Because let's say you
need a score of, like, 20.

00:49:51.060 --> 00:49:52.710
Well, if you're a
19, you're probably

00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:55.050
going to be facing a lot
of the same challenges

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:57.340
as a person who is, quote
unquote, "on the autism

00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:58.650
spectrum."

00:49:58.650 --> 00:50:00.590
But you wouldn't be able
to get the same help

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:01.840
and support as them.

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.410
And you wouldn't be able
to really explain it

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:06.790
in the same way to people.

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:09.360
And so, I think,
in that way labels

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:11.140
are very kind of limiting.

00:50:11.140 --> 00:50:16.390
I think the reality is that even
though we use the term autism

00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:20.290
spectrum, it really is just
a spectrum of human brains

00:50:20.290 --> 00:50:23.410
and that the autism
spectrum is part of that.

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:25.871
But it flows into the
spectrum of what's

00:50:25.871 --> 00:50:27.370
considered, quote
unquote, "normal,"

00:50:27.370 --> 00:50:32.580
as well, and that there isn't
necessarily one great way

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:35.910
to define what autism is,
where it starts, where it ends,

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:37.740
what is high-functioning
autism, what

00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:42.490
isn't high-functioning autism,
what's just normal, someone

00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:43.790
maybe just being an introvert.

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:47.890
So I think my relationship
with labels in general

00:50:47.890 --> 00:50:52.027
is not as positive as it is when
just using labels for myself.

00:50:52.027 --> 00:50:53.860
AUDIENCE: I want to get
back to the question

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:56.820
that the gentleman back
here asked about products.

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.880
Because you and I
have a relationship.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:02.060
And you may not
remember how difficult

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:05.340
it was for you to access
online information when

00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:08.380
you were younger and that
you had a lot of help.

00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.070
But not everybody has that help.

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:13.730
I mean, I know that it was very
visually confusing for you,

00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:15.770
knowing where to click
and where not to.

00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:19.010
So thinking about
it from that aspect,

00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:21.610
do you have any different
answer about what

00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:23.741
products might have been?

00:51:23.741 --> 00:51:26.220
GEORGIA LYON: I mean,
I just don't know.

00:51:26.220 --> 00:51:29.470
I mean, yeah, I
don't know, honestly.

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:30.540
That's the honest answer.

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:32.810
ENRICO BIANCO: I guess it
might be hard to remember.

00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:35.720
GEORGIA LYON: Yes, it's
hard to remember sometimes.

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:39.170
ENRICO BIANCO: For me, my
mother gave me a computer

00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:40.180
really early on.

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:44.470
And that was something, where
I just explored on my own.

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:46.650
And I learned by myself.

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:50.790
And so my mother was very
sort of hands-off about that.

00:51:50.790 --> 00:51:55.590
She definitely worked
to give me the tool.

00:51:55.590 --> 00:51:58.790
Like, I actually remember, she
built a computer from parts.

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:01.560
And she learned how to
do this, because she

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:04.340
wanted to be able to do this
for me, which was really

00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:06.210
super awesome of her.

00:52:06.210 --> 00:52:10.320
But when it came to, like,
exploring the World Wide Web--

00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:13.580
and back then, we had
bulletin board systems

00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:18.760
and so on-- she generally just
set me off and supported me

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:21.800
when things went
maybe less than good

00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:26.130
but was otherwise willing to
let go and just let me explore.

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:27.910
And I think that
was really useful.

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:30.930
AUDIENCE: And I think that
goes back to the diversity.

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:33.430
Many of the children that I
work with are exactly like that.

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.940
ENRICO BIANCO: Yeah.

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:36.064
AUDIENCE: They could be on
there exploring all day.

00:52:36.064 --> 00:52:37.914
But some people don't
come to it naturally.

00:52:37.914 --> 00:52:38.830
GEORGIA LYON: Like me.

00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:40.600
ENRICO BIANCO: I'm
sure that's true, yeah.

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.440
They always say that if you've
met one autistic person,

00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:43.950
you've met--

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:44.460
[IN UNISON] one autistic person.

00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:45.775
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:52:45.775 --> 00:52:48.034
Exactly.

00:52:48.034 --> 00:52:49.950
ENRICO BIANCO: And so,
with that, we'll close.

00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:51.750
And I want to thank,
again, everybody

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:55.020
for attending here in person
and watching the live stream.

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:58.350
We will have a recording
available later.

00:52:58.350 --> 00:52:59.700
Thank you very much.

00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:05.750
[APPLAUSE]
