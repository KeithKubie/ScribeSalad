00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:01.650
(haunting music)

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.860
- [Narrator] Nearly 50
tons of space debris

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.363
crash onto the Earth every day.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.193
While some debris shyly
dissipate into the atmosphere,

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.996
others display a spectacular light show.

00:00:15.996 --> 00:00:18.579
(mellow music)

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.760
Meteor showers occur
when the Earth's orbit

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.670
intersects with the orbit of a comet.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:27.110
As comets travel,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.880
they leave behind trails
of rocky material,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.880
oftentimes the size of
pebbles or grains of sand

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.840
but sometimes as large as boulders.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.230
Every year, the Earth crosses
these trails of debris

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.360
known as meteoroid streams,

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.170
and the planet becomes
sprinkled with rocky material.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.260
The debris then race through
the Earth's atmosphere,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.530
creating friction with air particles

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.280
and generating vast amounts of heat.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.850
This heat vaporizes and illuminates
the debris as they fall,

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.250
creating streaks of light in the sky,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.743
popularly known as shooting stars.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.470
These celestial light
shows are often named

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.540
after the constellation where
they appear to originate

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.050
as seen from Earth's surface.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:12.850
Meteor showers that seem to fall

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.490
from the constellation Perseus
are called the Perseids,

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.990
and those appearing from
the constellation Gemini

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.653
are called the Geminids.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.750
About 30 meteor showers
can be seen from Earth

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.860
throughout the course of a year,

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.920
and because the showers are
timed with Earth's orbit,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.140
the celestial phenomenon are cyclical

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.600
and occur at regular intervals.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.010
For example, the Perseid meteor
shower happens every August,

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.263
and the Geminid meteor shower
happens every December.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.670
Meteor showers have inspired awe

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.180
and admiration for millennia.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.370
In Christian tradition,
the Perseid meteor showers

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.470
symbolize the tears of
a saint, Saint Lawrence,

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.650
who was executed in
August of the year 258,

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.690
and in the first century A.D.,

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.640
the astronomer Ptolemy
believed that shooting stars

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.250
were a sign of the gods
looking upon mortals

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.023
and listening to their wishes.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.330
Inspiring everything from making wishes

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.350
to reveling at the sky,

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.410
meteor showers are a reminder of our place

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.672
in a dynamic and beautiful
cosmic ecosystem.

00:02:21.672 --> 00:02:24.339
