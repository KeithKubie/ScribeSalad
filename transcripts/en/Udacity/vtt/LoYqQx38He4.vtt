00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.680
So, now let's look in a little more detail to what is an IDE. An IDE is a

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.790
software application that supports software developers in many of

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.840
their everyday tasks. It has many useful features. Most IDEs

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.790
provide views that can be used to navigate, project

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.140
resources from different perspectives. For example, you might want to

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.390
look at your code differently when you're writing code,

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.950
and when you're debugging. They also normally provide an intelligent

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.380
source code editor. For example, an editor that will allow you

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.110
to browse the documentation when you're writing a code that

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.780
uses a specific method, or that will give you autocompletion when

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.990
you start writing the name of an object and you want to

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.820
get the methods for that object. And all of these things

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.420
can be very useful while you're developing and can save you a

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.750
lot of time. Modern IDE's will also normally give you support for

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.540
version control systems that then you

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.490
can use for softer configuration management.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.720
And we're going to discuss in detail version control systems in

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.380
the next tools of the trade lesson, and we're also

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.135
going to see how it can be integrated within an IDE.

00:01:01.135 --> 00:01:04.730
IDEs also give you builders so they give you build automation

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.070
tools, they give you runtime support. So that you can

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.960
run your projects from within the IDE and, for example,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.550
observe some aspects of the execution. In addition to giving

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.562
you support for the runtime, they give you support for testing.

00:01:17.562 --> 00:01:21.267
Many IDEs allow you to run tests from within

00:01:21.267 --> 00:01:23.520
the IDE and to check the results of the tests

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.300
from within the IDE. Not only that. Normally, after you

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.210
run your tests, if there are some test cases that

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.500
fail, you can also use your IDEs to do debugging.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.620
Many IDEs include graphical debuggers. Debuggers will allow you to

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:39.400
navigate through the code, set which points, stop and restart

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.160
the execution. Inspect variables, and do all of the activities

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.320
that help debugging. And, to help you be more efficient

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.440
and more effective when you do debugging. And into addition to

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.760
all these features that are listed here IDEs can normally provide

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.650
you even more features through a mechanishm that is called plugins.
