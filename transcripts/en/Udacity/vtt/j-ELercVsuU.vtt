One of the things we didn't
talk about the feature is,

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.170
I've done a fair amount
of angel investing.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.930
So, we've seen a lot of people come
in and pitch ideas, and when you're

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.030
watching people that pitch these ideas,
there's a lot you can tell from body

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.650
language, a lot that you can tell about
how people talk about how they got into

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.470
the current area that they're in and the
problem that they want to want to solve.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.950
And you can really feel that passion.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.130
I think as far as growing a team
around you, as an entrepreneur or

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.070
as an investor,

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.730
you can look at the entrepreneur and
you can see, well who's helping them?

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.280
Who are their advisors?

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.800
Who are the people who
have already signed up,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.870
maybe before there's ever any money,
before the business is formed?

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.020
And you can see as far is
to see a lot of evidence

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.890
of whether the person can
really do this or not.
