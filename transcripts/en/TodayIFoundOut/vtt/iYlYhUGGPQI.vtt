00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.290
Despite spending the last decade or so of
his career often injured, Ken Griffey Jr.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:14.170
was a 13-time All-Star, a 10-time Gold Glove
winner, a 7-time Silver Slugger award winner,

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:22.289
1997 MVP, 6th all-time in career home runs
with 630, and he accumulated nearly 80 WAR

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.429
(more on “WAR” in the Bonus Facts below).

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.480
Any number you look at, it’s clear Ken Griffey
Jr., nicknamed “The Kid,” was one of the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.980
greatest players ever to step onto a baseball
field.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.969
He became a superstar when he was only 19
years old, starting in center field for the

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:37.329
Seattle Mariners in 1989.

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.840
But just because someone is successful, famous,
and rich (it’s estimated he made over $150

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.910
million during his playing career) doesn’t
mean they can’t be sad or, even, depressed.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.829
After becoming one of the biggest can’t-miss
prospects in baseball history, at the age

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.719
of 18 the man who would not only be known
for that beautiful swing, but also for his

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.860
infectious and seemingly constant smile, attempted
suicide.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.860
Ken Griffey Jr. grew up in a baseball-centric
household.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.980
His father, Ken Griffey Sr., was a very good
Major Leaguer in his own right.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.160
A three-time All-Star, Griffey Sr. was probably
most well-known for being an integral part

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:22.380
of the 1970s Cincinnati Reds, who were nicknamed
“The Big Red Machine” and won back to

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.430
back World Series titles in 1975 and 1976.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.010
“Junior,” as his dad’s teammates came
to know the younger Griffey as, was often

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.500
around the Reds’ clubhouse during these
years.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.010
Johnny Bench, the Reds’ Hall of Fame catcher,
once said (jokingly) in an ESPN chat that

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.590
he saw Junior “stealing stuff out of my
locker when he was 8.”

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.460
Despite his apparent closeness with his father,
they fought a lot, according to Junior.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.410
“It seemed like my father and I were always
fighting,” Junior said in a 1992 interview.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.700
“I know a lot of kids go through that with
their families, but it was hard for me.”

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.240
Junior also said that both he and his father
were stubborn and intense, both good traits

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.260
to have as professional athletes, but not
always good when it comes to two such people’s

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.270
personal relationship.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:08.819
On June 2nd, 1987, the Seattle Mariners made
Ken Griffey Jr. the first pick of that year’s

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.190
baseball amateur draft.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.830
Junior was only 17 years old at the time of
the draft and was the first son of a Major

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.480
Leaguer to ever have been drafted first overall.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.380
The pressure on Junior was immense.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.920
Bob Harrison, a senior scout for the Mariners
at the time, wrote in his scouting report

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.500
that “He’s the best I ever seen…. has
all the tools to be a superstar.”

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.170
Right away, he dominated the Minor Leagues,
putting him on the fast track to the majors.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.090
Despite playing well, his personal life was
in disarray.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.080
He was living away from home for the first
time and didn’t know how to be a professional.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.530
“He had no supervision,” said Ken Griffey
Sr. in a 1992 interview, “I had people tell

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.930
me what he was going through, keeping late
hours and all, very late hours.”

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.810
In addition, he encountered things he never
had to deal with growing up in an affluent

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.810
household.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:04.340
There was an incident in Bellingham, Washington
where he was called racial slurs and was chased

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.590
with a gun.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.230
In addition, he felt like no matter what he
did on the field, his coaches were always

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.400
criticizing him.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.170
In every sense, Junior was being forced to
become an adult when he was still only “The

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.170
Kid.”

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.430
When he came home for his first offseason
as a professional ball player, he moved back

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.760
in with his parents.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.310
Things were not smooth there either.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.740
“It seemed like everyone was yelling at
me in baseball, then I came home and everyone

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.220
was yelling at me there,” Griffey recalled
in 1992, “I got depressed.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.730
I got angry.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.660
I didn’t want to live.”

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.440
In January 1988, Junior swallowed nearly 300
aspirin in a suicide attempt, something that

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.700
could indeed have resulted in his death.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.790
According to Dr. Larry Pedegana, one of the
Mariners’ doctors at the time, “ingesting

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.180
a lot of aspirin will cause metabolic acidosis,
which can be fatal.”

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.090
Jr. was found covered in vomit in his car
by his girlfriend and her brother.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.290
He was rushed to the hospital by his girlfriend’s
mother, where his stomach was immediately

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:01.290
pumped.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.290
He would remain in the intensive care unit
at Providence Hospital in Mount Airy, Ohio

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.040
for several days.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.320
Senior later admitted that he was “scared,
even angry” at his son for his suicide attempt.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.750
In fact, when Senior came and visited Junior
at the hospital, they once again began arguing.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.919
“I ripped the IV out of my arm,” Junior
said in the ‘92 interview.

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.569
“That stopped him yelling.”

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:25.949
Junior got better and his relationship with
his father improved.

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:28.240
“The problem was with me and my father…

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.419
There weren’t any deep problems with me
afterwards,” Junior stated in a 1992 interview.

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.830
Junior was in the Majors the next season,
1989, starting in center field for the Seattle

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.389
Mariners.

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:44.150
On August 29th, 1990, the Seattle Mariners
signed Ken Griffey Senior, at the age of 40,

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.439
to a contract for the remainder of the season.

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:51.499
Two days later, on August 31st, Junior and
Senior became the first father-son combo to

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:54.150
play in the same Major League game.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.650
On September 14th, in a game against the California
Angels (who ended up winning the game 7-5),

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.550
Ken Griffey Sr. strode to the plate in the
bottom of the 1st and promptly drove a two

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:06.669
strike pitch into the stands.

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:11.960
Junior was the next hitter and he waited for
three balls before he slammed the next offering

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.169
out of the park.

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:18.150
Junior and Senior had hit back to back home
runs, claiming another distinction in baseball

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.520
history as the only father-son combo to hit
back to back homers.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.909
Ken Griffey Jr. retired from baseball during
the 2010 season, one of the legends of baseball.

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:32.199
Today, he works for Mariners as a special
consultant, working with Minor Leaguers on

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:33.289
their defensive skills.

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:35.130
He’s also a dad to three children.

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.759
None of which would have happened had his
suicide attempt been successful.

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:40.949
Junior later stated:

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:43.340
Don’t ever try to commit suicide…

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.340
Talk to people.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.340
Go another way.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.340
Don’t kill yourself.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.800
It ain’t worth it and I’m a great example…

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.410
I am living proof how stupid it is….

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.300
No matter how bad it seems at the time, work
your way through it.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:23.009
Who knows how your life is going to turn out?
