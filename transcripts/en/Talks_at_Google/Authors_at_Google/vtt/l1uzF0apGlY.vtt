RACHEL: So without further
ado, please welcome Dr. Judith

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.203
Wright.

00:00:05.203 --> 00:00:07.926
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.926 --> 00:00:10.300
JUDITH WRIGHT: All of you,
I'm so glad to see all of you.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.730
Let me assume, given the
topic, how many of you

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.010
want a great relationship?

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:15.060
Can I see that?

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.732
Yeah.

00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:17.440
How many of you want
one that's horrible?

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.630
I don't think many.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.700
I think we all want that.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.740
But let me ask you this.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.150
Who is committed to having
great relationships?

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.294
And if you are, stand up,
because that puts more

00:00:25.294 --> 00:00:26.460
of the commitment out there.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.120
Let's just see.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.690
If you're committed
to having a--

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:30.890
Now we're going to do
a little mini relating.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.200
Really quickly, say hello
to at least another person

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.700
so that we're really starting
the whole thing with relating.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.130
Hi, hi, hi to you
in the live stream.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.980
That's great.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:39.480
Good.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.235
Thank you.

00:00:40.235 --> 00:00:43.760
You can come back
and take you seats.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.000
That's great.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.542
Because if we're not willing to
relate, and risk, and get out

00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:49.291
of our comfort zone,
then it's really hard

00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:51.020
to have satisfying
relationships at work

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.420
or in our personal lives.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.650
So I really want to thank
you, Rachel, for having me.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:55.566
It's great to be back.

00:00:55.566 --> 00:00:56.320
Thank you so much.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.080
And to Google for hosting
these wonderful opportunities

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.590
to be able to share
ideas with one another.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.599
I also want to acknowledge
the transformers.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:08.510
We've had this blessing to coach
couples for over 30-some years,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.180
actually from pre-marital
work all the way through

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.360
from empty nesting.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.620
We know what the whole arc
is now over all this time.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.830
And we work with not
just couples in trouble,

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.970
but couples who really want
to just play this game of what

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.450
is possible in intimacy.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.020
How can we take
relationships farther

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.630
than people have taken them?

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.820
How do we go beyond our
parents and grandparents?

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.570
What's possible in
intimate relationships?

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.380
So there's been this
grand experiment

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.660
for over 30-some
years which we've

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.270
done as part of the
Wright Foundation

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.145
for the Realization of
Human Potential, where

00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:39.660
we do everything we can to
bring out the best in people,

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.830
to energize their lives, and
to also ignite their world.

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.550
So becoming the very best
person you can become obviously

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.320
changes the people
around you, which

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.902
is our mission, so that we
can have a planet that's

00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:50.985
conscious and sustainable.

00:01:50.985 --> 00:01:53.300
And we try to work on
it one person at a time

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.760
is how our mission works.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.870
So we've also been
studying these people who

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.220
have dedicated themselves
to, really, what's possible,

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.410
who can I become?

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.660
And also dedicating to
intimacy and relationships.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.355
So these transformers,
I call them,

00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:08.979
who've been working this couples
work for all these years-- not

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.210
all of them have been
in 30 years, obviously.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.751
The program's been
going in that way.

00:02:11.751 --> 00:02:14.500
But our divorce rate
is 4% to 9% as opposed

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.930
to the divorce rate in our
country, which is over 50%.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.280
And that's actually not
the most important thing.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.030
The most important
thing is they're really

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.870
thriving, satisfying, juicy,
intimate, growing, evolving

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.710
relationships.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.380
And that's what I
am interested in.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.130
And I also want to thank all the
researchers and all the people

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.100
we pulled together.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.290
And we've been
studying everything

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.210
we can about relationships at
the Wright Graduate University.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.310
And we teach this.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.590
And we pull together
the most relevant,

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.300
emerging technologies
and research

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.595
to these kind of topics.

00:02:41.595 --> 00:02:43.095
And all the thinkers
and researchers

00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:44.680
whose work we pulled together.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.570
And I want to also thank
my husband and my partner.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.390
Because part of my research is
my own relationship with my guy

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.540
over-- it'll be 35
years in a month.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.600
So I know of what I speak.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.670
I know what works well.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.734
And I know what doesn't.

00:02:58.734 --> 00:03:00.900
And I'm going to share a
lot of that with you today.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.250
Let me find out a little
bit more about you.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.970
How many of you are
in a relationship,

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.470
a committed
relationship, right now?

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.060
OK.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.870
How many of you are
or have been divorced

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.850
at some point in your life?

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.446
Who's dating or should be?

00:03:13.446 --> 00:03:15.635
I guess you're
single [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:15.635 --> 00:03:18.660
How many of you have ever
had a tough break up?

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.870
How many of you wish
you'd broken up sooner?

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:21.890
Yeah, I know.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:22.920
I know that one too.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.200
I'm sure there's a lot of
stories that we all have.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.214
And I'm going to be focusing a
lot on intimate relationships,

00:03:28.214 --> 00:03:29.880
but everything I'm
talking about relates

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.299
to all kinds of relationships--
with work relationships,

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.090
family relationships,
friend relationships.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.530
Let me find out.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.410
How many of you want better
relationships with friends?

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.490
Let me look at that.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.050
OK, great.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.060
Me too.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.330
Coworkers?

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.030
Teams at work?

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.630
Bosses?

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:42.740
How about bosses?

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.100
Yeah, that's OK.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.390
Then your family?

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.150
Let me see that.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.730
How many would like
better dating experiences,

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.890
whatever that might be?

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:52.680
OK.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.430
Who would just
like more intimacy

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.080
in the relationships you have?

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.870
How about just more
love, in any way

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.280
you define that for yourself?

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.425
How about more phenomenal sex?

00:04:01.425 --> 00:04:02.800
I'm not going to
talk about that,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.675
but I thought that would
get you interested.

00:04:04.675 --> 00:04:06.300
Although the things
we're talking about

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.214
do contribute because
the ways that we relate

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:09.630
that get ourselves
more available,

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.660
get us closer and
closer to one another.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.850
So again, what I'm
going to talk about

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.050
is going to affect everything.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.591
And I'm really
excited to be with you

00:04:15.591 --> 00:04:17.230
and appreciate this opportunity.

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.800
And if you are
interested and there's

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.300
something you
would like more of,

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.030
I have a special gift for
you toward the end that I'm

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.644
excited to share with you.

00:04:24.644 --> 00:04:25.560
So let's look at this.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.461
We all want great relationships.

00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:29.710
They're one of the most
important things to all of us.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.680
It's the thing that means the
most to me in my own life.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.120
Yet, they don't always work
out, or we don't always

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.700
have the skills to do what it
is that we need to be doing.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.200
So I want to look
together with you.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.810
I'm going to ask you to
work with me a little bit.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.930
I'm going to divide the
room up a little bit,

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.000
maybe about right here.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.345
So this side of the room,
I'll give you one assignment.

00:04:46.345 --> 00:04:48.220
And this side of the
room-- actually, there's

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.195
more of you on this side.

00:04:49.195 --> 00:04:49.520
Oops.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.540
So we're going to
cut it right here.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.250
I'm going to cut
you right in half.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.240
So this way, you'll be
one, and then the rest.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.469
What I'd like for you to
do is just get together

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:57.510
with two or three people.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.885
Turn around so you've got a
group of two or three people.

00:04:59.885 --> 00:05:03.370
And I want you to brainstorm
for a minute on this side what

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:05.730
makes a great relationship.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.550
And on this side, if you gather
together just for one minute,

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:09.957
what makes a bad relationship?

00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:11.290
With are terrible relationships?

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.020
What are the elements of
just bad relationships,

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.260
whether they're love
relationships, work

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.060
relationships, family,
whatever it is.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.832
Bad relationships,
good relationships.

00:05:17.832 --> 00:05:19.540
If you just grab a
couple people and just

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.540
brainstorm for a minute.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.250
And I'll call you
back in a moment.

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.254
I'll raise my hand when it's
time for us to come back.

00:05:25.254 --> 00:05:28.733
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.420
Just about another 10 seconds.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.930
OK, if you'd finish that
thought and come on back.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.013
We'll brainstorm together.

00:06:36.013 --> 00:06:37.400
Come on back.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.674
Come on back.

00:06:38.674 --> 00:06:40.590
And if we do some
discussions throughout this,

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.439
I'll raise my hand,
and if you see my hand,

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:43.730
that's our signal to come back.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:45.540
If you didn't raise your
hand, then be quiet.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:46.680
That would help bring
the energy back.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.638
But you're pretty good.

00:06:47.638 --> 00:06:48.600
You're well-trained.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.484
So let me find out.

00:06:49.484 --> 00:06:50.650
Let's start with what's bad.

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:51.930
What are the elements
of a bad relationship?

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.430
Can you shout some
things out to me.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.140
What did you come up with?

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.860
AUDIENCE: A lack
of communication.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.401
JUDITH WRIGHT: Lack
of communication.

00:06:57.401 --> 00:06:57.990
What else?

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.670
AUDIENCE: Self-centered.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:59.580
JUDITH WRIGHT:
Self centeredness.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.170
Yeah, good.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.866
What else?

00:07:00.866 --> 00:07:01.740
AUDIENCE: Disrespect.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.440
JUDITH WRIGHT: Disrespect.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:04.190
AUDIENCE: Blaming.

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.880
JUDITH WRIGHT: Blaming.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:05.250
Oh, yeah.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.660
That's a biggy.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.190
Yeah.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.690
Good.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.110
Not that any of us ever do that.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.172
But you know, others we've
known, they've had that happen.

00:07:11.172 --> 00:07:12.630
Well, let's find
out what they say,

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.100
and then probably
whatever the opposite is

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:16.160
of that is probably what
we would have on this side.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.160
So what are the elements
of a good relationship,

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.500
a great relationship?

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.580
Oops.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.481
Like that.

00:07:21.481 --> 00:07:21.980
Sorry.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:22.580
What was that?

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.200
AUDIENCE: More positives
than negatives.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.470
JUDITH WRIGHT: More
positive than negatives.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:25.970
Great.

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:26.780
Perfect.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.860
Thank you.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:28.436
What else?

00:07:28.436 --> 00:07:29.230
AUDIENCE: Communication.

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:30.451
JUDITH WRIGHT: Communication.

00:07:30.451 --> 00:07:31.300
AUDIENCE: Respect.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.341
JUDITH WRIGHT: Respect,
which you had disrespect.

00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:33.900
Thank you.

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:34.510
What else?

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.450
AUDIENCE: Chemistry.

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:36.491
JUDITH WRIGHT: Chemistry.

00:07:36.491 --> 00:07:37.140
Good.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.800
Anything else?

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.120
AUDIENCE: Honesty.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.270
JUDITH WRIGHT:
What was that one?

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.630
AUDIENCE: Honesty.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:40.588
JUDITH WRIGHT: Honesty.

00:07:40.588 --> 00:07:41.460
Good.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.060
Well, all right,
this is interesting.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.034
And it's common knowledge
of the kind of things

00:07:45.034 --> 00:07:45.950
that we're looking at.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:47.540
But I really want us
to be aware of what

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.540
you think are great
relationships, what makes them,

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.570
and what makes bad ones.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.190
Because then we're going to
compare it to the research,

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.530
and see what we found and
what researchers have found.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.780
How accurate are we?

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.590
So I wanted to get
you started with that.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.960
So one of the things
I'd like to start with

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.360
is let's look at
that quiz you took.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.390
And if you didn't
take it, you can maybe

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.360
come along with the rest of us.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.110
And those of you in
the live stream, we'll

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.424
summarize some of
the concepts soon.

00:08:10.424 --> 00:08:11.590
All right, look at the quiz.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:13.798
And what I'd like you to do
is take your little quiz,

00:08:13.798 --> 00:08:17.770
that little card, and count
all of your true responses.

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.226
Count all the true choices.

00:08:20.226 --> 00:08:21.404
How many trues did you have.

00:08:21.404 --> 00:08:22.320
We'll start with that.

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:30.480
Counting.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.419
I think most of you got it.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:39.326
All right, how many of
you had all 20 true?

00:08:39.326 --> 00:08:43.055
How about between 15 and 20,
maybe somewhere in there?

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:44.450
OK.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.020
10 to 15?

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:46.880
OK.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:48.870
And how about 5 to 10?

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:49.370
OK.

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:49.870
Perfect.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.310
And anybody less than 5?

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.550
OK, good.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:58.230
So if you answered true to
any one of these questions,

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:03.270
you are under the mythology
of romance and relationships,

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:05.380
because none of them are true.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.670
Absolutely none
of them are true.

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:08.170
None.

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:08.940
Did I say none?

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.730
I think I said none.

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.350
So none of them are true.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.670
Because this is what's
really interesting-- those

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.570
of you in the webcast,
the live stream,

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:18.340
you can see a little bit
of what we're looking at.

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:20.548
Because we think these are--
they're all relationship

00:09:20.548 --> 00:09:22.910
myths that limit intimacy
and really keep us

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.010
from having the kind of
contact and connection

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.010
we can have with others.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:29.000
And in fact, the higher your
ratio of true to false, then

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.690
the more you're under the
influence of this relationship

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:32.464
mythology.

00:09:32.464 --> 00:09:33.630
And these are just a sample.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.650
This isn't all of them.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:36.025
Alfred Adler says
that each of us

00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:38.070
has these fictive
goals that we have.

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:40.720
We imagine these things
and expecting something

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.250
from relationships that
just aren't realistic

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:44.340
and really set us up.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:45.580
So this is part of what
I wanted to look at.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.570
They set us up for
relationship failure too,

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.480
that if you believe
them to be true,

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.740
you don't focus on
what it really takes

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:53.250
to have great relationships.

00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:54.958
And that's part of
the problem with them.

00:09:54.958 --> 00:09:56.550
They take our
attention from what we

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:57.910
need to be paying attention to.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.686
And even if we know they're not
true-- I know they're not true,

00:10:00.686 --> 00:10:02.060
and I'm still
under the influence

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.130
of these, which is really
interesting to see of this.

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.630
If we just look at this in the
bigger sense, how many of you

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.590
would like more romance
in your life, however

00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:10.810
you define that for yourself?

00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:12.159
The women and the men are too.

00:10:12.159 --> 00:10:13.700
I don't mean to be
sexist about that.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.270
But I think it's
something important.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.228
But let's look at that.

00:10:16.228 --> 00:10:17.830
Let's look at
romance for a moment.

00:10:17.830 --> 00:10:20.246
And, Katie, if you could do
that one, that would be great.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.480
I want to show you
a little video clip.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.468

00:12:24.778 --> 00:12:27.238
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.240
JUDITH WRIGHT: Yeah, I know.

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.890
I know that this is a myth of
romance, and I cannot tell you,

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:35.310
I get totally turned on by this.

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.960
I have chills, and my
heart's going pitter patter.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:38.720
And I know better.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.210
So I am not alone with this.

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:42.232
So that is part of it.

00:12:42.232 --> 00:12:43.190
But let's look at this.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:44.710
What did you notice
in these clips?

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:46.749
What's the quality
of what's going on?

00:12:46.749 --> 00:12:48.040
AUDIENCE: Lots of Richard Gere.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:48.850
JUDITH WRIGHT: Lots
of Richard Gere.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:49.580
I know.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:50.170
Richard Gere.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:50.460
Like, what?

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.250
Isn't that amazing?

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:51.580
I know.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:52.320
It's hilarious.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.872
What else did you notice?

00:12:53.872 --> 00:12:55.190
AUDIENCE: Grand gestures.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.440
JUDITH WRIGHT: Grand gestures,
totally grand gestures.

00:12:57.440 --> 00:12:57.939
Yeah.

00:12:57.939 --> 00:12:59.672
And how about the conversations?

00:12:59.672 --> 00:13:01.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.650
There's like none.

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.470
There's a soundtrack,
and nobody's talking.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:05.650
You don't know anybody.

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:06.570
It's just this thing.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:07.800
You get whisked away.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.710
This is what's implanted
in our minds in that way.

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.490
And that's why we are forever
fighting these illusions

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:15.210
in our work.

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.160
And even when we know
better intellectually,

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.680
they still are part
of our culture.

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.490
In fact, studies show
that 78% of people

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:25.070
have Cinderella type elements in
their notions of romantic love

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.885
and how we think--
not just romantic.

00:13:26.885 --> 00:13:28.010
In this way, it's romantic.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:29.968
But what relationships
are supposed to be like.

00:13:29.968 --> 00:13:33.214
And when you have that, and
most people do to some degree,

00:13:33.214 --> 00:13:34.880
you experience a lot
of disillusionment,

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.020
and angst, and disappointment
in relationships.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.590
And the research
shows that as well.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.190
So here's the issue.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:42.530
Most everything we are
taught about relationships

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.310
doesn't work.

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:45.772
It is wrong, the things
that are in our culture.

00:13:45.772 --> 00:13:47.730
There are certainly some
good things out there,

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.650
but the bulk of it is not.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:51.880
Often, they don't lead
to great relationships.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.270
Oftentimes, advice we
get is actually harmful,

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.060
actually creates a
lack of connection.

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.519
And they're found in
these relationship myths

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:01.810
and misconceptions, starting
with this myth of romance.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.050
And I want to go into
that a little bit more

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.970
just so we can use that as
an overall context for some

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.636
of the things we're
going to talk about.

00:14:06.636 --> 00:14:08.880
This is what the dictionary,
how it defines romance.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.880
It's really interesting.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:13.830
First one is "a love affair,
especially a brief and intense

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:14.550
one."

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.880
And the second one is
"sexual love, especially when

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.980
the other person
or the relationship

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.121
is idealized and not real."

00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:21.620
Great.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:24.790
Romance means you have a
brief, fake love affair.

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:25.440
Awesome.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.060
And this is what
we want more of.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:29.180
That's kind of wild
when you look at that.

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:32.130
So wouldn't we
rather have a love

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:33.670
affair that isn't just brief?

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.950
Or a sexual love that's
actually with a real person?

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:37.949
Where we're real and
connected with one another?

00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:38.947
Like, hello?

00:14:38.947 --> 00:14:41.030
The third definition though
is really interesting.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:42.200
And I want to use it to
frame what we're going

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.283
to be talking about today.

00:14:43.283 --> 00:14:45.520
It's romance defined
a little differently.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.790
Romance is an exciting
adventure with "the potential

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:50.660
for heroic achievement."

00:14:50.660 --> 00:14:51.870
Now this is more interesting.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.769
This is what we're
looking at here.

00:14:53.769 --> 00:14:55.310
Now this means that
you have to have,

00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.440
really, the courage that it
takes to be real, and present,

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.500
and authentic.

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:02.570
Where you're sharing
your fears and your joys,

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:07.040
your tears and your happiness,
your gifts and your weaknesses.

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.720
You're telling the truth.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.430
Because it's really easy to
woo someone with chocolates,

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:12.800
and flowers, or whatever.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.860
It's easy to make
reservations for dinner.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.060
It's really difficult to
share your reservations

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.150
about yourself, or
about your partner,

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.540
or about the people around
you, or your friends,

00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:23.760
or about the
relationship itself.

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.970
And this is the crux
of what this is really

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.160
about to have intimate,
thriving relationships.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.036
It's easy to ask somebody
out to see a movie.

00:15:31.036 --> 00:15:33.076
Well, actually, it's not
all that easy sometimes.

00:15:33.076 --> 00:15:34.370
Sometimes, that's kind of hard.

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.660
But it's harder to ask someone
to really see you fully

00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.000
for who you are and to really
ask them to reveal themselves

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.389
that deeply so you
really can see them.

00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:44.680
So what you want to look at
is, what is the real truth?

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.032
If it's not the myth of
romance, then what is it?

00:15:47.032 --> 00:15:49.480
What is it that really creates
thriving relationships?

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.938
Those of you that are interested
in business relationships,

00:15:51.938 --> 00:15:54.120
I am focusing this more
on couples for today,

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.700
but everything
we're talking about

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.557
is applicable to
business situations,

00:15:57.557 --> 00:15:58.640
and to work, and to teams.

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.120
We use this in our
consulting, and our teaching,

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:03.600
and our training in businesses
and companies every day.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.020
So you'll have to do
a little translating.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:06.145
I'll do some of it for you.

00:16:06.145 --> 00:16:09.239
But I want to make this point
about it because the concepts

00:16:09.239 --> 00:16:09.780
are the same.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.359
The way we need to engage in
our romantic relationships

00:16:12.359 --> 00:16:14.900
is the same we need to engage
at work, and with our families,

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:15.560
and everyone.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.402
It's being ourselves fully, and
we're going to look at that.

00:16:18.402 --> 00:16:19.360
But let's look at this.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.651
I want to show us "The Heart
of the Fight" [? truth. ?]

00:16:21.651 --> 00:16:24.240
It's this heroic adventure,
not quite the movie type.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.140
But what is the truth?

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.626
What is really the opposite of
this, and what do we go for?

00:16:28.626 --> 00:16:30.250
I'm going to show
you another clip that

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.070
shows the beginning of a
beautiful relationship.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:34.403
And I want you just to sense
what you feel with this one

00:16:34.403 --> 00:16:36.680
and see how that relates
to what we just looked at.

00:16:39.596 --> 00:16:43.000
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.572
-You're bored.

00:16:44.572 --> 00:16:45.780
You're bored and you know it.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.850
You wouldn't be here if there
wasn't something missing.

00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:52.340
-Arrogant son of a bitch.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:54.140
-Would you just stay with me?

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.290
-Stay with you?

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:55.820
What for?

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.320
Look at us.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.278
We're already fighting.

00:16:57.278 --> 00:16:59.050
-Well, that's what we do.

00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:00.430
We fight.

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.680
You tell me when I'm being
an arrogant son of a bitch,

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.000
and I tell you when you're
being a pain in the ass.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.310
Which you are 99% of the time.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.772
I'm not afraid to
hurt your feelings.

00:17:10.772 --> 00:17:12.480
They have like a two
second rebound rate,

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.950
and you're back doing the
next pain in the ass thing.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:16.530
-So what?

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:17.910
-So it's not going to be easy.

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.407
It's going to be really hard.

00:17:19.407 --> 00:17:21.490
And we're going to have
to work at this every day,

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:23.770
but I want to do that,
because I want you.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:25.079
I want all of you.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:26.109
Forever.

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:27.050
You and me.

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:28.210
Every day.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.770
Will you do something for me?

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:31.270
Please?

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:35.330
Will you just picture
your life for me?

00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:38.940
30 years from now, 40 years
from now, what's it look like?

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.010
If it's with that guy, go.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:41.540
Go.

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:44.410
I lost you once, I think
I could do it again,

00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:47.120
if I thought that's
what you really wanted.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.790
But don't you take
the easy way out.

00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.290
-What easy way?

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:51.440
There is no easy way.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.520
No matter what I do,
somebody gets hurt.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.610
-Would you stop thinking
about what everyone wants?

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:58.700
Stop thinking about what
I want, what he wants,

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.700
what your parents want.

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:03.140
What do you want?

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.300
What do you want?

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:05.400
-It's not that simple.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.050
-What do you want?

00:18:09.738 --> 00:18:12.098
Damn it, what do you want?

00:18:12.098 --> 00:18:13.034
[END PLAYBACK]

00:18:13.034 --> 00:18:13.825
JUDITH WRIGHT: Wow.

00:18:13.825 --> 00:18:14.324
I know.

00:18:14.324 --> 00:18:15.209
So what's the movie?

00:18:15.209 --> 00:18:16.250
AUDIENCE: "The Notebook."

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:17.420
JUDITH WRIGHT: "The
Notebook," "The Notebook."

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:17.820
All right.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:18.860
Let's just look
at this a minute.

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:21.151
So what's the difference in
this clip than what we just

00:18:21.151 --> 00:18:21.827
watched before?

00:18:21.827 --> 00:18:22.660
So what do you know?

00:18:22.660 --> 00:18:25.057
What's the quality
of this relationship?

00:18:25.057 --> 00:18:26.140
AUDIENCE: They're talking.

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:28.042
JUDITH WRIGHT: They're
talking, for one.

00:18:28.042 --> 00:18:29.500
But then they're
talking genuinely,

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.830
and they're in
each other's faces.

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:31.560
They're fighting.

00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.469
They're fully there.

00:18:32.469 --> 00:18:34.510
They're going for what
they really need and want.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:37.090
And he's asking her,
don't try to please me.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38.990
Do what it is that
you need to be doing.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.380
That's a whole different
kind of love going on here.

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:42.900
There's something
much more real.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:43.980
So if you compare
this to fairy tales,

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:45.580
fairy tales don't have
room for the tough times.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:46.760
They don't have
room for fighting.

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.900
They don't have room for
the truth in that way.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:49.880
They're nice.

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.830
They're not real.

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:51.910
They're not fighting.

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:53.870
Great relationships
have great fights,

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.110
and I think this is an
example of one of those.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:57.700
And being real instead of nice.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.890
And instead living
happily ever after,

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:02.420
I'm proposing we live
deeply ever after.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.700
Because that's
where the juice is.

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.140
That's where the growth
is and the intimacy is.

00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:08.620
So if I look at
these myths, I've

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:09.740
started out with
the myth of romance

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.670
because I want to set
this context of how

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:12.700
that gets in our way.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.033
But there's several other myths.

00:19:14.033 --> 00:19:17.020
Let me show you the ones
that we want to look at.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:18.360
There's a myth of romance.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:21.690
There's a myth of relationships
are supposed to make you happy.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:24.730
There's a myth of love means
you accept me for who I am.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:27.930
There's a myth of the
one or a soul mate.

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:29.551
There's a myth of compatibility.

00:19:29.551 --> 00:19:30.800
And one of you said chemistry.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.490
Chemistry is a myth also.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:35.110
The other is a myth of
attraction, somewhat related.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.680
Or if it's love, it should be
easy, or all you need is love.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.721
So I can go through all
of these or any of these.

00:19:39.721 --> 00:19:41.640
Which ones do you
want to fight me on?

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.250
Which ones-- no, this
one has to be true.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.310
Are there any that bug you more?

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.810
Yeah?

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:48.240
AUDIENCE: The one
about acceptance.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.730
JUDITH WRIGHT: About
acceptance, all right.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:50.370
Anybody else?

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:50.890
What else?

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:51.790
AUDIENCE: Chemistry.

00:19:51.790 --> 00:19:52.880
JUDITH WRIGHT: Chemistry.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:53.330
AUDIENCE: Attraction.

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:54.770
JUDITH WRIGHT: Attraction.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:55.340
OK.

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:55.900
AUDIENCE: Soul mate.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:56.450
JUDITH WRIGHT:
What was that one?

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:57.020
Soul mate.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:57.550
What else?

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:58.450
AUDIENCE: Compatibility.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:19:59.330
JUDITH WRIGHT: Compatibility.

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:00.955
All right, you're
picking most of them.

00:20:00.955 --> 00:20:03.220
So maybe we'll just go
at it, because these

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.540
are the things I think
most of us are looking for.

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:08.610
So I'll try to run through as
many as I can, and we'll see.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:11.282
So the first one's-- actually,
I don't think any of you said

00:20:11.282 --> 00:20:12.740
this one, but I'm
going to do this.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.531
If I had a relationship,
then I'd be happy.

00:20:14.531 --> 00:20:15.429
Let me just set that.

00:20:15.429 --> 00:20:16.970
This is the happily
ever after thing.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.630
So she's, wow, if I just
had that, then I'd be happy.

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:22.320
Turns out the research
is that no, it

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.300
may boost your happiness for a
little bit, up to maybe a year

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.986
and a half or two,
but after that, we

00:20:26.986 --> 00:20:28.610
go right back to the
level of happiness

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:30.550
we had before we got
in a relationship.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:32.840
It appears we have a
happiness set point.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.930
And nobody's going to
change that for us.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:38.079
The only person that can
make us happy is ourselves.

00:20:38.079 --> 00:20:40.370
Nobody else can do that, as
much as we want them to do.

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:42.846
So what the issue with
this is that what happens

00:20:42.846 --> 00:20:44.720
if we expect a relationship
to make us happy,

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.842
and when the inevitable
problems come up,

00:20:46.842 --> 00:20:49.300
then we think there's something
wrong with the relationship

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.190
rather than what
could be happening.

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:53.740
So each of us is
100% responsible

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.390
for our own satisfaction
and happiness.

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:56.880
That's one of our
rules of engagement

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.780
that I think I'll talk
about a little bit later.

00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:00.154
And the purpose
of a relationship

00:21:00.154 --> 00:21:02.160
is not to make you happy.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.920
It's for you to learn,
and to grow, and to become

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.310
the best person you can become.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.690
And that's a very different
premise in that way.

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:10.549
So who wanted the
accept me for who I am?

00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:11.590
Somebody over-- yeah, OK.

00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:11.820
Great.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:12.817
Let's look at that one.

00:21:12.817 --> 00:21:14.400
Love means you accept
me for who I am.

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.816
I mean, we're all
hungry for that.

00:21:15.816 --> 00:21:18.390
We want somebody to
love us for who we are.

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:20.480
Some acceptance, of
course, is helpful.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.660
But it also can be an
excuse for poor behavior.

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.210
Hey, just love me the way I am.

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:26.340
So you don't work that way.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:27.100
And a lot--

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:30.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.745
And a lot of women
sometimes think

00:21:31.745 --> 00:21:33.620
they're being-- and
others, and men as well--

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.745
think they're being accepted,
but actually, they're

00:21:35.745 --> 00:21:37.640
really not being seen
or even dealt with.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.740
They're not known.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.540
And that's not really accepting.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.037
So the real truth of
this one is that what's

00:21:43.037 --> 00:21:45.120
really important that we
found in our own research

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.578
and other researchers
have found is

00:21:46.578 --> 00:21:50.730
it's more important to love who
you are becoming, who you could

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:53.500
be, not just who you
are, which is really

00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.000
an important
difference in that way.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.680
Because what makes great
relationships is supporting

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:01.717
your partner to become the very
best person they can become.

00:22:01.717 --> 00:22:04.300
Supporting the people that you
work with to become their best.

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.790
Supporting your friends
to become their best.

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.700
That's where relationships
start taking off.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:13.440
And it's not supporting them
to be who you want them to be.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.400
It's supporting them to become
who they want to become.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.330
Who is their ideal self?

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:20.010
What is their
vision for themself?

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:21.680
And how can you empower that?

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.590
That's what creates
intimacy in relationships.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:26.240
And in fact, the more
your relationship

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.800
results in you
learning, and growing,

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.040
and new things that make you a
better person, the better, much

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.370
more satisfying relationships.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:35.300
Whether this is at home or at
work, it's very much the same.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:37.150
And the more self-expansion,
they call it,

00:22:37.150 --> 00:22:39.790
that you experience through
being with this person,

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:42.260
through new ideas, novel
ways of looking at things,

00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.742
new perspectives,
the more satisfied

00:22:44.742 --> 00:22:47.200
you are and the more committed
you are in the relationship.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.670
There's another thing called
the Michelangelo effect,

00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:52.210
Michelangelo phenomenon.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:55.120
Where, if you're conscious, and
this is really conscious living

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.180
in relationship, if
you're conscious,

00:22:57.180 --> 00:23:00.250
every interaction
can help sculpt you

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:03.820
and the person that you're with
into becoming their next-- we

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:05.890
call it your next most
radiant self, that you you

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:06.870
haven't become yet.

00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:08.960
That if you look at your
relationship that way,

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:11.860
that that's its purpose, to
really dive in in that way,

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.170
to sculpt our best self.

00:23:13.170 --> 00:23:16.030
The purpose of a relationship
is not to accept who you are,

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:18.530
it's to become who
you could become.

00:23:18.530 --> 00:23:20.750
And that's a different
focus for what relationships

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.840
are really about, and the
one that really works.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:24.680
Who wanted soul mate?

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:25.700
Yeah, all right, good.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.230
This one's a popular one.

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:29.580
73% of Americans
believe that they

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:32.740
are destined to find
their one, true soul mate.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:34.530
But what happens, if
you believe in that,

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:36.196
it makes it actually
much more difficult

00:23:36.196 --> 00:23:38.620
to have intimacy
because you romanticize.

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:39.460
It doesn't last.

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.230
It doesn't lead to
real relationships.

00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:43.082
It's passionate at first.

00:23:43.082 --> 00:23:44.540
But when problems
arise, you figure

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:45.769
you just have the wrong one.

00:23:45.769 --> 00:23:47.560
This must not be my
soul mate, so you don't

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.851
tend to invest in the same way.

00:23:48.851 --> 00:23:51.060
You think you're not
meant for one another.

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.240
So you leave.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.810
You give up on it pretty early.

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:56.480
What they're finding is you
tend to be more anxious and less

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.020
likely to forgive if you
have that kind of framework

00:23:59.020 --> 00:23:59.740
in your mind.

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.140
You start looking
for the right person.

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:02.940
This one's not it.

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.940
I'm going to get back on
the market or whatever.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.380
And you know what it leads to?

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.290
Really great one night stands.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:13.100
Passionate, short,
brief, flaming, wow.

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.490
It's great for that.

00:24:14.490 --> 00:24:16.710
But long-term intimacy, no.

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:18.350
Short-term fiery ones, yeah.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:19.620
But not long-term.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.470
Because what we're
finding is that believing

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.490
in cultivating
relationships, you're

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:27.299
less likely to reject your
partner over dissatisfaction.

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:28.840
You're more likely
to dive into them,

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.520
and learn, and grow,
which is really important,

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.254
and become more understanding
of yourself and the other.

00:24:34.254 --> 00:24:35.920
So more importantly,
rather than looking

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.522
for your soul mate, look for
someone who is willing to grow,

00:24:38.522 --> 00:24:40.230
look for someone who's
willing to become,

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:42.221
willing to grow with
you in that way,

00:24:42.221 --> 00:24:44.720
and who's willing to work on
themselves in the relationship,

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.120
do the hard work in becoming
who they can become.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.730
The more you believe that
relationships evolve, and grow,

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:53.210
and deepen with hard
work, the better.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.960
So it's not finding
the right person,

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.580
it's being the right person.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.490
If some of you are
single, be the person

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:01.950
that you would like to marry.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:05.100
Whatever those elements are, you
be that, and then attract that

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:05.830
to you.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:06.830
That's what's important.

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:08.390
Not looking to get completed.

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:09.390
I mean, you complete me.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:09.889
Ugh.

00:25:09.889 --> 00:25:11.510
No, complete yourself.

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:13.270
And then let somebody
add to that for you,

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.544
but not about being
completed in that way.

00:25:15.544 --> 00:25:17.460
Let's look at compatibility
because one of you

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:18.873
said that too.

00:25:18.873 --> 00:25:19.700
All right.

00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:22.350
So many of us believe that
having a lot in common

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:24.260
means that we're
meant to be together.

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:25.920
We both have the same tattoos.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.224
If you look at
dating sites, yeah.

00:25:28.224 --> 00:25:29.640
Dating sites are
like, I'm looking

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.080
for someone who likes
the same stuff I

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.190
like, and lets go do stuff.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:37.960
Think of, oh, romantic
walks on the beach,

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.475
or certain philosophies, or
literature, or Mexican food,

00:25:40.475 --> 00:25:42.850
whatever it is, as if that's
going to be the thing that's

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:44.850
going to make us connect.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:45.660
It's not.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:49.700
Because compatibility
is totally overrated.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.480
Really compatible
couples, people,

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:54.110
are not more
happier than others.

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:55.767
When people say
we're not compatible,

00:25:55.767 --> 00:25:57.850
what they usually mean is
we're not getting along.

00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:59.840
It's really not about
what this is about.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.120
Great relationships
change over time.

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.824
We use what we call the law
of complementarity, where

00:26:04.824 --> 00:26:06.490
you can look for
people who are actually

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:08.500
even different than you
that you can learn from,

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.440
that can rub your edges in
a way, that are sometimes

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.111
even irritating, but
it's helping you.

00:26:14.111 --> 00:26:15.360
You don't feel so comfortable.

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.480
You're more learning
from one another.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.060
And in that way, like
in my relationship,

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.930
I was the quieter one,
believe it or not.

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:23.740
I was the quieter one
in the relationship.

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.073
I was a little more introverted.

00:26:25.073 --> 00:26:28.060
My husband's opinionated, and
straight-talking, and truthful,

00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.400
and straight out, and assertive.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.100
I really had to learn from him.

00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:33.600
I've been going to
school on him how

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.320
to express myself more fully.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.800
He's been going to school
on me on more of acceptance.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.770
So we're learning
from one another,

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:43.579
but not expecting
ourselves to be the same.

00:26:43.579 --> 00:26:45.120
Except when we do,
and then we fight,

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:47.740
and I'll tell you more
about when that happens.

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.210
More importantly
is common values,

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:52.550
common purposes, not
common interests,

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:54.640
which I think makes
sense when we say this.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.130
OK, who are my chemistry ones?

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:57.670
We had a few people that
wanted to look at chemistry.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:26:59.140
All right, let's
look at this one.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.598
So here's the issue
with chemistry.

00:27:00.598 --> 00:27:02.680
When the chemistry
is great, we don't

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.890
have meaningful
combative discussions

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:06.570
about what really matters.

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.455
We are relating with our bodies,
not our minds, which is great.

00:27:09.455 --> 00:27:10.830
But let's not
pretend that that's

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:13.080
the only thing that helps
us have these relationships.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.310
So what happens is that
with this chemistry,

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:17.870
there's this chemical rush.

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:20.480
It's a surge of chemicals, and
these hormones, and serotonin,

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.480
and dopamine is moving
through our bodies.

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.590
And if you do a brain
scan of someone when

00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:26.480
we're looking and
thinking about our beloved

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.560
when we're in these
lustful parts of it,

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:31.030
your brain looks like you've
got an obsession compulsion

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:32.980
disorder or you're
really on drugs.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:34.520
We are so high.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.120
We are just high.

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.700
It's that love sick feeling,
all these chemicals racing

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.620
through our system.

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:41.119
But the chemicals,
we're high, we're

00:27:41.119 --> 00:27:42.550
obsessed, in an altered state.

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:44.310
But the chemicals don't last.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:45.280
They're not meant to.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.340
They never last.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:49.219
And then people think, oh,
when the chemistry invariably

00:27:49.219 --> 00:27:50.760
weakens, they think
there's something

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.770
wrong with the relationship.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:52.660
I'm not attracted
to them anymore.

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:54.100
We don't have any chemistry.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:54.600
No.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.780
It ran its course.

00:27:55.780 --> 00:28:00.510
It's supposed to because
no chemical reaction just

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.400
keeps going.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.880
Maybe some do, but they
complete themselves.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.790
So what could be
happening though,

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:09.310
it just got you together in a
way where you're getting ready

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:11.900
for the next levels of
relationship, which are really

00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:13.550
where it starts to
become interesting.

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:15.666
Companionate love
is the part of this.

00:28:15.666 --> 00:28:17.540
So I want to look at
that for a second, which

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:21.600
is the combination of being
securely attached and connected

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.670
to another person,
having more intimacy,

00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:24.632
having deep affection.

00:28:24.632 --> 00:28:26.090
And you can have
this with friends,

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:27.010
you can have this as coworkers.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:28.950
It doesn't just have
to be loved ones.

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:31.560
And then toward more consummate
love, which many people

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.560
consider-- let me
go back to that--

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.220
the most blissful
kind of love possible,

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.500
where you have attraction,
and passion, and commitment,

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.980
and security, and realness.

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:45.550
There's a depth of relationship
that you're getting ready for.

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:47.810
But if we think it's
just about the chemistry,

00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:49.930
we won't allow
ourselves to do the work

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:52.310
to evolve to these
other parts of relating.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:53.090
This is related.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:54.205
Somebody said attraction,
so we're going

00:28:54.205 --> 00:28:55.600
to go to that one for a second.

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.900
This is related to chemistry.

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.630
But what happens,
we are attracted

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:02.300
to people that is an
unconscious response to people

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:07.190
who, unknowingly to us,
represent our parents.

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:10.320
So what happens, they represent
aspects of our relationship

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.280
with a parent.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.696
So for example, if you
had a distant father,

00:29:13.696 --> 00:29:15.070
for a woman, maybe
perhaps you're

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.860
attracted to more distant men.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.710
Or sometimes, you can go
the opposite way with that.

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:23.372
So you maybe had more of an
abusive father, for example,

00:29:23.372 --> 00:29:25.330
you might try to go toward
more milquetoast men

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:26.690
to try to avoid that.

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:29.801
But it has an impact on
who we're attracted to.

00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:30.550
So the same thing.

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:34.270
If you can see these
childhood kinds of things.

00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:37.450
Maybe your father was somewhat
of a jerk in some ways.

00:29:37.450 --> 00:29:39.942
But you will be
attracted to jerks.

00:29:39.942 --> 00:29:41.400
I just want you to
understand that.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.360
That that will be
what turns you on.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.760
Because what happens, we have
this attachment relationship

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.840
schema that's formed
when we're very young.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.250
It forms in these neural
pathways of our beliefs

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:52.970
and our feelings.

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:57.210
And whatever felt like love
to us when we were young

00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:58.800
is what we think love is.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.560
And if it doesn't
feel like that,

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.320
we don't get attracted to it.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.840
So we don't know
this consciously,

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.142
but that's what's
going on inside of us.

00:30:07.142 --> 00:30:09.100
How many of you have
gotten attracted to people

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.640
before that just really
weren't good for you?

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.030
I have.

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:15.520
Well, there's a reason for that.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.940
We can use that data.

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.509
We can use that to unlock
some of those patterns

00:30:19.509 --> 00:30:20.300
and work with that.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.640
But it's really important.

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.880
And how many of you have
been in a relationship

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.380
that the person
just made you crazy?

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:26.290
You're so freaking
turned on by them.

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:27.560
You're just like, oh my god.

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.900
I am not the only one
that has had that.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:30.720
Great.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.910
But what happens with that,
if they make you crazy,

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:34.540
and you keep in
relationship with them,

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:35.498
they'll make you crazy.

00:30:35.498 --> 00:30:37.800
Because that's how it
starts and what happens.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.786
So what we want to
look at, and I'm

00:30:39.786 --> 00:30:41.160
going to work with
this in a bit,

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:45.870
is that the law of engagement,
not the law of attraction,

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:50.150
is what builds attraction and
fulfillment in relationships.

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:52.630
Engaging fully, really
knowing yourself

00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:55.330
and another person is
what builds attraction.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:58.440
Did any of you see-- actually,
it surfaced again not too long

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.954
ago in the "New York Times,"
"The 36 Questions of Intimacy--

00:31:01.954 --> 00:31:03.370
How to Fall in
Love with Anybody."

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:03.773
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:31:03.773 --> 00:31:05.523
JUDITH WRIGHT: Yeah,
so it is fascinating.

00:31:05.523 --> 00:31:06.981
The study was done
a long time ago,

00:31:06.981 --> 00:31:08.360
but it surfaced recently again.

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.260
Arthur Aron did this.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:10.840
There's a list of
36 questions that

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.520
have increasing
degrees of exposure,

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.420
and vulnerability, and truth.

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:18.050
And you also then look at
someone for four minutes.

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:21.170
Well, the people that did
this started feeling attracted

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:23.010
and loving toward one another.

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:24.690
They were total strangers.

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:27.770
So the moral of the story
is to get to know someone,

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:31.120
to be more revealed, to be
more real, is where the deeper

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:35.370
kinds of attraction come from,
not just that surface stuff,

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:36.850
which is what we need.

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:38.687
And again, getting to
know people at work

00:31:38.687 --> 00:31:41.270
is just as important to getting
to know the people that you're

00:31:41.270 --> 00:31:45.240
dating, or living with, or
are in the field for you.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.900
The other is all
you need is love.

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:49.900
Well, yeah, no.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.290
It's not at all.

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:54.030
Because relationships, like
any growing, organic thing,

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:54.840
need tending to.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:55.870
They need sustenance.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.640
They need resources.

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.850
You got to pull the weeds.

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:00.510
You got to give it the
nourishment that it needs.

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:02.640
And it takes skill, and
practice, and dedication.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.820
Not just love.

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:06.780
This belief makes people
lazy in love, which I

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:08.090
think you can see in that way.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:10.316
So the real truth about
this is great relationships

00:32:10.316 --> 00:32:12.190
take a tremendous amount
of conscious effort.

00:32:12.190 --> 00:32:14.370
It's really a conscious
thing to keep it in mind.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:16.619
And usually, we're only
conscious of our relationships

00:32:16.619 --> 00:32:19.460
in the beginning because
they're filling our mind.

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:21.240
But then once we
get used to them,

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.950
we're not as
conscious about them.

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:25.610
We're not as mindful
about what's going on.

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.380
And we don't put the
effort into them.

00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.830
And we wonder why
they don't work.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:32.240
We don't expect other areas
of our life to be that easy.

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.050
We enhance our career.

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:35.720
We work on our sports skills.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.899
We do our yoga classes.

00:32:36.899 --> 00:32:38.190
We do our mindfulness training.

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:40.430
We do things to get
better at things.

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:42.320
But we don't do this
for relationships.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.140
We do lifelong training for
many things in our lives,

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.540
but not in relationships.

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:48.154
What's that about?

00:32:48.154 --> 00:32:50.570
Because what's interesting,
we work more on our golf swing

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:53.362
sometimes than we do
on our relationships.

00:32:53.362 --> 00:32:55.570
And relationships are the
most important thing to us,

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:57.970
but we're not putting in
what we could to do that.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:59.390
And in fact, the
earlier you work

00:32:59.390 --> 00:33:00.598
on relationships, the better.

00:33:00.598 --> 00:33:04.410
Not waiting to have a problem,
doing it to enhance it.

00:33:04.410 --> 00:33:06.300
So in fact, they did
a study of newlyweds.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:07.820
The newlyweds that just
worked on their relationship

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.080
to have the best
relationship they could have

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:12.490
were three times more
likely to succeed

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:14.740
than those that waited till
they had a problem to seek

00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:16.720
some counsel or some training.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.870
So working on yourself,
and not the relationship,

00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:22.140
is what really matters.

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.060
There's many people
who think we need

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.130
to work on the relationship.

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:24.760
No, you don't.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.330
You need to work on you.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:30.060
You becoming the most honest,
truthful, real, genuine, person

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:33.080
you can become, fighting the
battles you need to fight,

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.647
is what can shift
a relationship.

00:33:34.647 --> 00:33:36.980
Nice if you have someone that
joins you in that journey,

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.854
but just you doing that
makes the difference.

00:33:38.854 --> 00:33:41.500
And then you can bridge
it to the relationship.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.450
So I'm hoping maybe you're a
little sobered by some of this.

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.400
I've needed to be
sobered by some of this.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:49.330
And we've looked at what we
thought was good but isn't.

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:51.800
But I would like to
look at what does help

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.380
in having great relationships.

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:54.505
You can go on this journey.

00:33:54.505 --> 00:33:56.540
I'll pick a couple of
these to work with.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:00.030
We've been doing this study on
people who live great lives.

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:03.310
And we found that they not
only had these great lives

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:05.820
with amazing
vocational potential,

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.450
and they're making
more money, and they

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:09.790
were serving more
fully, their community

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:12.120
service was beautiful, their
missions, everything was

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:12.620
amazing.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.820
But we found they had
this depth of intimacy

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:16.990
in their relationships
with their loved ones,

00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:18.739
with their families,
with their coworkers,

00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:19.830
with their employees.

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:21.730
And we're talking, whoa,
what are they doing?

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:23.850
So we studied them,
and it was interesting.

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:26.790
We found this fascinating
thing, that there

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:29.040
are these six skills-- I'm
not going to go into these,

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.498
I'm going to touch
on the first two

00:34:30.498 --> 00:34:33.300
a little bit-- that not
only lead to great lives,

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.400
but lead to great relationships.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.670
And we pulled this
research together first

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:38.857
in our book "Transformed."

00:34:38.857 --> 00:34:40.690
And now, we're applying
it to relationships.

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:43.106
[? It's been ?] so fascinating
in "The Heart of the Fight"

00:34:43.106 --> 00:34:44.810
that we're talking about today.

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:47.658
So the first thing, the first
skill here out of all these--

00:34:47.658 --> 00:34:49.449
these are the six skills
that are in there,

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:51.948
so if you want more, you know
where to get it-- is yearning.

00:34:51.948 --> 00:34:54.319
This yearning is really,
really, really important.

00:34:54.319 --> 00:34:56.360
So I want to talk to you
a little bit about that.

00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:00.860
Because yearning is the basis
of all of our relationships.

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:03.022
And I want to talk to
you about what these are.

00:35:03.022 --> 00:35:04.980
Because when we're really
in touch with what we

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:07.680
really, deeply long
for, and we allow

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:10.830
that to guide us in our
moment to moment interactions,

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:13.530
even here, as we're in
this room right now.

00:35:13.530 --> 00:35:17.050
The yearning that we all
have to love and be loved.

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:19.490
The yearning that we have
to be seen, to be heard,

00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:21.950
to be understood, to be known.

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:25.660
The yearning we have to be
affirmed, to express ourselves,

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.790
to grow, to develop, to become.

00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:30.370
The yearning to matter,
to make a difference,

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:32.690
to do what we came
here on Earth to do,

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:34.125
to be in touch
with our emotions.

00:35:34.125 --> 00:35:35.500
If we are in touch
with those, we

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:39.540
can expect satisfaction moment
by moment by moment by moment.

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:41.530
There's always
something you can do

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:43.610
that can help you touch
those greater yearnings.

00:35:43.610 --> 00:35:44.800
It's not a big move.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.350
It's not a broad stroke.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:49.800
But just in this moment, I'm
yearning to be heard by you.

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:51.232
I'm yearning to
connect with you.

00:35:51.232 --> 00:35:53.190
I'm aware of those things
as I'm being with it,

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:55.700
and it brings a quality
to my experience.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:57.450
I'm not saying that I
always fulfill that,

00:35:57.450 --> 00:35:59.950
but I'm aware that that's
my hunger as I'm right here.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:02.340
It matters to me that we relate.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:03.340
I yearn to matter.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.760
I hope I make a difference
for you in some way today

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.430
that something sparks that.

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:09.390
That's part of
what's fulfilling me

00:36:09.390 --> 00:36:12.100
as I'm speaking this because
I'm in touch with why

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:14.290
I'm doing what I'm
doing and what matters.

00:36:14.290 --> 00:36:17.650
And that's what's really
important in relationships.

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:20.280
Because any fight you
have is because you

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.480
have an unmet yearning.

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.270
Any conflict you have at work,
you have an unmet yearning.

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:26.726
Perhaps you yearn to be seen,
and you're not being seen.

00:36:26.726 --> 00:36:28.350
You yearn to contribute,
and you're not

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:29.722
finding that in that way.

00:36:29.722 --> 00:36:31.180
You yearn to be
understood, and you

00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:33.240
don't feel that people
are really getting you.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:35.080
You yearn to make a
difference, and you

00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.980
don't feel like what
you're doing is having

00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:38.385
the impact you want it to have.

00:36:38.385 --> 00:36:40.510
You yearn to connect and
belong, and perhaps you're

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:43.134
not having this sense of
connection with your teammates

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:44.300
that you really yearned for.

00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:47.030
The upset comes from
the unmet yearnings.

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:50.520
And any moment where you
feel like, oh, satisfied.

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.590
Oh, this feels so good.

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:54.441
That means your
yearnings have been met,

00:36:54.441 --> 00:36:56.190
and that's why this
is important to really

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:57.600
be with this in that way.

00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:59.350
And in order to work
with these yearnings,

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:00.724
we have to do
something about it.

00:37:00.724 --> 00:37:02.110
We can't just yearn.

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:05.360
There's a great "Seinfeld"
clip-- do you yearn?

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.110
But we have to do
more than just yearn.

00:37:07.110 --> 00:37:09.489
We have to really do
something about it.

00:37:09.489 --> 00:37:11.280
We have to engage,
which is the next thing.

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:12.840
And I want to talk
about this more.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.150
We have to engage in life, in
conflict, in our relationships,

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:18.170
in our work, in our teams.

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:21.390
Because what doesn't work
is the opposite of this.

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:23.990
We have to be willing to
get hurt, live unedited, be

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:26.004
made fun of, risk, be messy.

00:37:26.004 --> 00:37:27.795
These kinds of things
are really important.

00:37:27.795 --> 00:37:30.930
We have to go out of our comfort
zone in order to be real,

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:32.110
to have relationships.

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:34.710
Because relationships aren't
about being careful or walking

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:35.694
on eggshells.

00:37:35.694 --> 00:37:37.360
They're about being
out there, and going

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.818
for what it is we
need and we want,

00:37:38.818 --> 00:37:40.310
and being as honest as we can.

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:42.560
So it's also doing that, we
need to be willing to make

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.890
mistakes and make them boldly.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:44.890
We're going to screw up.

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:47.015
If we're too careful,
we don't relate.

00:37:47.015 --> 00:37:48.850
When we're too, oh,
what will they think.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:49.572
I can't do that.

00:37:49.572 --> 00:37:50.280
What will happen?

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.040
I need to wait until
he's in a good mood.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:54.248
No, I need to wait until
when the boss has had lunch.

00:37:54.248 --> 00:37:55.340
He's better after lunch.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:56.800
I mean, yeah, somewhat.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.590
But no, be with
what's true for you,

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:00.760
what really matters to you.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.067
And act on those
yearnings in the moment.

00:38:03.067 --> 00:38:05.150
So I'm going to give you
a little context on this.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:06.830
This is in a
relationship continuum,

00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:07.885
the engagement continuum.

00:38:07.885 --> 00:38:09.510
On the left side,
there's all the stuff

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:11.817
that we do that's
neutral and destructive.

00:38:11.817 --> 00:38:13.400
Actually, neutral
becomes destructive.

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.941
You end up going
backwards with that.

00:38:14.941 --> 00:38:16.930
That's the stormiest
stuff of any relationship.

00:38:16.930 --> 00:38:18.390
But we want to go
to what is it that's

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:19.590
going to be more constructive.

00:38:19.590 --> 00:38:21.340
How do we have these
transformational kind

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.830
of relationships that
make a huge difference?

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:26.800
The key between these two
sides of this continuum

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.590
is being conscious and being
in touch with your yearnings

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:31.860
and having your feelings
available to you.

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.930
With that, something
much more powerful

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:36.360
can happen in our relationship.

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:39.360
So I'm going to show you
a little bit about what

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.824
we need on the right side in
this engagement continuum.

00:38:42.824 --> 00:38:44.740
And I want to set this
context in saying this.

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:46.609
But relationships
aren't fragile.

00:38:46.609 --> 00:38:48.650
I mean, if we treat them
like a hot house flower,

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:49.983
they're never going to flourish.

00:38:49.983 --> 00:38:51.480
Most of you, I can't do that.

00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.290
He can't take that.

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:56.100
She can't-- you have no idea
what people are capable of.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.280
Relationships are resilient, way
more resilient than we expect.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.080
And we're way too
careful oftentimes.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.480
I don't mean you need to
be a toxic dump on people.

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.600
I don't mean that.

00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.450
But I really do want
you to understand

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:10.040
that there is an importance
of being real and genuine.

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:16.350
So this whole part about
[GROANS]-- oh, did I miss one?

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:17.240
Oh, let me go.

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:17.860
All right.

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:19.270
Love is messy.

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:20.227
I love this photo.

00:39:20.227 --> 00:39:20.935
Like, it's messy.

00:39:20.935 --> 00:39:22.200
Are they having fun?

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.620
It's like, love is messy.

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:24.120
It's dirty.

00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.703
We have to be willing
to get in there.

00:39:25.703 --> 00:39:27.530
Fairy tales are all sanitized.

00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:28.960
That "Notebook" scene?

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:29.967
That was messy.

00:39:29.967 --> 00:39:30.800
They were out there.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.175
They were yelling
at one another.

00:39:32.175 --> 00:39:34.170
They were getting more
truth out in that way.

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:37.030
But true love is not
some sanitized version

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:39.970
of running across the
field in slow motion

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:42.610
or whispering sweet
nothings in somebody else's

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:46.090
ear or that field of
wildflowers or whatever that is.

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:48.060
It's just not about that.

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:51.930
Nor is it perfectly
synchronized,

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:57.090
beautifully synchronized,
no-sweat, no-fart sex.

00:39:57.090 --> 00:39:57.790
That's not it.

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:00.090
I mean, it's like these
imaginary things that we think,

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:01.160
it's not it at all.

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:03.650
It's really full engagements,
rolling up your sleeves,

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:05.760
and being willing to get
into the relationship.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:08.244
It's saying beautiful
things and hurtful things,

00:40:08.244 --> 00:40:09.660
the things you
love and the things

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:12.130
you hate, the things you care
about deep in your heart,

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:14.630
the things you're afraid of,
the things that make you happy,

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:17.240
the things that bring you
joy, and being that revealed.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:20.307
It's being open and
real and responsible.

00:40:20.307 --> 00:40:22.390
But to do this, you need
some rules of engagement.

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:23.640
So I'm going to cover
a couple of these

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.790
because these are pretty
practical that you

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:27.160
can take in this.

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.660
The rules of
engagement we've found,

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:31.050
over all these years we've been
testing-- what is it that makes

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:32.030
for thriving relationships?

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:33.090
We use these in business.

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:34.470
We use them in families.

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:35.470
We use them in couples.

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:37.520
So see if you can
look at this one.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:41.434
The first one may seem
kind of yeah, sure,

00:40:41.434 --> 00:40:42.850
we should accentuate
the positive.

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:46.040
But I cannot tell you how
important this is because this

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.980
is looking for what's
positive in other people,

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.340
in your teammates, in your boss,
in the person you're dating,

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:53.990
in your loved ones,
in your family.

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:56.090
It's looking for
opportunities in your job

00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:57.460
and your relationships.

00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:59.670
It's looking for ways to grow.

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:01.810
How can I grow from
this situation?

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:04.230
It's being fully engaged
in it so that you

00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:07.540
can build this backdrop
of trust and goodwill

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.070
so you can weather some
of the tougher times.

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:11.770
It's shifting your
perspective to see

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:14.117
what is there instead
of oftentimes,

00:41:14.117 --> 00:41:16.200
just looking for what's
not there, what's missing.

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.590
But what is there?

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:19.591
Chances are there's a lot
more than you've seen.

00:41:19.591 --> 00:41:21.048
See, and the other
thing I want you

00:41:21.048 --> 00:41:22.750
understand about
romantic relationships,

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:23.830
intimate relationships.

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:27.740
Relationships do not break up
because people are fighting.

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:30.160
They break up because they
don't have enough of this.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.517
You have enough positives
built up, like in your bank.

00:41:32.517 --> 00:41:34.100
You can weather a
lot of difficulties.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.660
You've got good will that
you can work things through.

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.530
And this is what's
missing for most people.

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:40.030
And this is what's
missing in teams.

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:42.460
This is what's missing
at work a lot of times.

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.790
And it's what's missing in
the quality of our lives.

00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:46.706
And I wanted to give you
some examples of what

00:41:46.706 --> 00:41:49.437
this is, that the research
shows-- and ours does,

00:41:49.437 --> 00:41:51.520
as well-- that we have to
be conscious about this,

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:54.640
looking for it, grabbing
it, soaking it in, really

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:58.460
allowing ourselves to have
that, be there for ourselves.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:04.100
So things like more humor,
having more joy and more fun,

00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.311
goofy, spontaneous interacting.

00:42:06.311 --> 00:42:08.060
I mean, you have a
slide in this building.

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:09.200
I mean, you have
all kinds of ways

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:11.200
to be able to engage that
can help you break out

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.930
of the norms of these
social constraints.

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:17.270
But it's also showing interest
and curiosity in other people,

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:19.200
asking real, genuine
questions, and wanting

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.040
to hear the answer to them,
not just how was your day.

00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:24.752
How was your day?

00:42:24.752 --> 00:42:26.210
Someone comes back
from a meeting--

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.680
what happened at the meeting?

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.380
How was it?

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:31.560
Really being interested in
what's going on with people

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.790
and really being present to
whatever that is for yourself

00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:36.532
and to the other person.

00:42:36.532 --> 00:42:37.740
And this one, I mean, I know.

00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:38.850
We all know about being present.

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:40.540
But it's really difficult
because we're usually

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:42.581
thinking about something
else and the next thing.

00:42:42.581 --> 00:42:43.340
You are right now.

00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:45.840
How many of you are present
with what I'm talking about?

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.700
I hope you are because
that would be great.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:49.340
But our minds go a lot
of different places.

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.923
To bring ourselves back, to be
present in the moment with what

00:42:51.923 --> 00:42:53.330
we're experiencing.

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:55.940
So this also means that
we need to be accessible.

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:57.200
We need to be available.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.710
We need to be
responsive and learn

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:01.760
to be more responsive to
others in that way, and also,

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.900
emotionally engaged,
not just intellectually,

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:07.370
not just with our minds,
which is really important.

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:08.179
This is one.

00:43:08.179 --> 00:43:10.470
How many of you want more
appreciation and affirmation?

00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:13.100
I'm just going to-- you don't
have to do laundry to get it,

00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:14.292
even though it's
like doing that.

00:43:14.292 --> 00:43:14.791
You can.

00:43:14.791 --> 00:43:15.760
That is one way.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:18.510
But it's really important
because also, men

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:20.090
need it more than women.

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:22.260
And oftentimes, we don't
show the appreciation

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.220
and affirmation, or
appreciation for just the

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:28.992
doing that happens, the doing
the laundry, whatever that is.

00:43:28.992 --> 00:43:30.700
This one, I think,
you can all relate to.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:33.570
Who wants more affection
in their lives?

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:34.360
I did, too.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:37.110
But I wasn't as willing to be as
affectionate as I needed to be.

00:43:37.110 --> 00:43:39.680
My husband was more affectionate
with me than I was to him.

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:41.740
And I really had to
go to school on him.

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:42.680
I was shier.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.140
It's very vulnerable
to be affectionate.

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:46.650
Now, I'm cuddlier
and everything.

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:48.110
I had to work on that.

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:49.550
But look at these.

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:51.070
Yeah, who doesn't
want some of that?

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:51.970
You know?

00:43:51.970 --> 00:43:52.700
I love these.

00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:56.240
Aw, to have your
relationship go to that.

00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:56.760
Yeah.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.070
And PDAs are really important.

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:02.050
Public displays of affection
are really, really important

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:04.180
because that's saying
in public, I care.

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:05.080
I'm here.

00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:05.795
I'm with you.

00:44:05.795 --> 00:44:06.790
You matter to me.

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:09.340
I'm willing to be seen
as someone who loves you.

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.860
It's a really important
thing for us to share.

00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:14.080
Another is to be more
supportive and to be

00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:18.985
an advocate for others and to
inspire each other in this way.

00:44:18.985 --> 00:44:20.820
I'm just going to
give you a sense

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:22.470
of being engaged in that way.

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:25.470
Another one is celebrating
other people's victories

00:44:25.470 --> 00:44:28.610
and their wins as if
they were your own,

00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:31.005
being as excited for what
goes well for people.

00:44:31.005 --> 00:44:32.380
What these studies
are showing is

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.296
that it's much more
important than being there

00:44:34.296 --> 00:44:36.400
when somebody is
down, that it really

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:39.970
is what brings them more the
depth of connection for people.

00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:44.020
And taking risks, saying the
unsayable, doing the undoable,

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:47.300
really just going beyond
wherever you would have been.

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:49.120
And I think you can
understand this.

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:51.490
Gifts and variety and
surprises are important.

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:54.020
Boredom is an issue
at work, at home,

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:55.920
in your romantic relationships.

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:59.230
And it's up to you to
create the sense of newness.

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:02.910
And sharing your dreams and
your hopes with everyone,

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:06.550
with people at work, with your
family, with your beloved.

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:09.210
Really allowing people to
know you by sharing your hopes

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:11.280
and your dreams makes
a huge difference.

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.680
They did studies
of couples talking.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.460
And it's interesting.

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.710
They just studied all the
things a couple talked about

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:18.940
during a week.

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:22.580
Most couples talk about
logistics and stuff and plans.

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:25.900
And at the max, couples
had 17 minutes a week

00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:29.800
where they talked about
something other than logistics.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:30.500
I know.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:31.660
And that's common.

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:35.000
So really bridging this to what
we really need to be doing.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.100
And sharing our fears
with one another,

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.320
and our missions,
what matters to us.

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:42.470
And where we're headed
in our lives in that way.

00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:44.780
Having a sense of shared
meaning and purpose

00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:45.880
is really important.

00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:47.463
Rachel, can you do
this thing with me?

00:45:47.463 --> 00:45:49.902
Can you stand up and do a
thing with me for a second?

00:45:49.902 --> 00:45:53.650
All right, so Rachel and
I are in relationship.

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:56.342
So at this level-- so
we're in relationship.

00:45:56.342 --> 00:45:57.550
So now put your hand up here.

00:45:57.550 --> 00:45:59.450
If you have a mission
and I have a mission,

00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:01.900
we have a higher purpose,
the fighting and the stuff

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:04.640
within the relationship, this
doesn't have so far to go.

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.120
It can work through that.

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:09.240
But if we don't have this, this
is where the stuff happens.

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:11.450
There's no reason to
work stuff through.

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:14.038
Well, I hope that
demo-- OK, great.

00:46:14.038 --> 00:46:16.580
It's really important,
makes a big difference.

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:17.870
And I thank you for that.

00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:20.050
So this one is obviously
really important.

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:22.370
Having a sense of
vision, looking

00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:25.020
beyond the horizon, where you're
going, what matters to you,

00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:27.480
and sharing that
with one another.

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.800
This kind of way of
accentuating the positive

00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.220
keeps you mentally fit.

00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:34.190
It is like a form of active
mindfulness in your life

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:35.670
and applying it
to relationships.

00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:39.350
We call Mindfulness 2.0, because
it's engaged in the moment, not

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:41.440
just a meditation,
which we love as well,

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.630
but to really be mindful
of our relationships

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:45.800
and what helps craft
that and craft us.

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.680
It's living more
mindfully moment

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.740
by moment with one
another and with others.

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:54.200
And we are responsible for
our own mental fitness.

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:57.514
And this is what actually helps
us train our hearts, as well.

00:46:57.514 --> 00:46:58.930
I'm just going to
go a little bit.

00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:00.846
I should probably just
end it on the positive.

00:47:00.846 --> 00:47:02.500
I'm going to give
you one other rule.

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.291
Then I'll show you.

00:47:03.291 --> 00:47:05.835
Then we'll do a thing to
wrap this up in a bit.

00:47:05.835 --> 00:47:08.210
The other part of this, we
need to minimize the negative.

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:10.889
So we need to be build
this basis of the positive.

00:47:10.889 --> 00:47:12.430
But we need to
minimize the negative.

00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:14.420
And in fact, why I didn't
show this one first,

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:15.870
this one-- minimize
the negative.

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:19.180
For every snarky,
icky thing we do,

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:23.170
every mean-spirited,
every whatever we do,

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:25.520
the research shows we need
five of those positives

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.956
to just balance off that one.

00:47:26.956 --> 00:47:28.330
And we're all
going to be snarky.

00:47:28.330 --> 00:47:29.590
We're going to do stupid things.

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:30.610
We're going to say mean things.

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:31.720
We're going to hurt
people's feelings.

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:32.990
It's part of being human.

00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:34.360
Just take responsibility for it.

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.635
Don't be so careful.

00:47:35.635 --> 00:47:37.010
But also know
you've got to build

00:47:37.010 --> 00:47:38.750
this backlog of all
the other great stuff

00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:40.310
so that you can weather this.

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:42.500
I mean, you being real
is really important.

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:43.860
So let's look at these.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:48.020
The things to not do, we need to
decrease, is avoiding conflict.

00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:50.120
You avoid conflict,
you're avoiding intimacy.

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:51.510
You're avoiding creativity.

00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:53.670
You're avoiding
possibilities in relationship

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:54.845
at work or at home.

00:47:54.845 --> 00:47:56.540
I have a couple of these.

00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.540
Yeah, talk to the hand.

00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:01.190
Also not hiding out, whether
that's in your relationship

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:02.580
or at work.

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:05.020
It's very damaging
to relationships.

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.060
It's very, very costly to that.

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:09.470
Having secrets, having
the real conversations

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:11.690
at work in the hallways
rather than at the meetings,

00:48:11.690 --> 00:48:13.640
or talking behind people's
back, or gossiping

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.380
rather than being
straight with people,

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:17.130
is another part of the issue.

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:20.230
Gossip, drama, but
also being checked out,

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:23.060
kind of disengaged, that's
damaging to relationships

00:48:23.060 --> 00:48:25.530
and damaging to work,
in teams at work.

00:48:25.530 --> 00:48:27.274
There's so many of these.

00:48:27.274 --> 00:48:29.440
And I know many of you know
Gottman's work probably.

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:32.000
But he has these four horsemen
of the apocalypse, the four

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.583
things that they
found are just really

00:48:33.583 --> 00:48:35.570
destructive to relationships.

00:48:35.570 --> 00:48:37.970
Withdrawing, oh, this is
another disengaged one.

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:40.209
Is that so zoned?

00:48:40.209 --> 00:48:41.250
Let me give you this one.

00:48:41.250 --> 00:48:45.260
Withdrawing and stonewalling,
really not engaging,

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:46.970
is really deadly
to a relationships.

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:49.960
Being defensive and
passive aggressive,

00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:52.220
whether you literally
flip the bird or not.

00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:54.130
But that's a defense
that you have.

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:57.140
Being critical is
part of this as well,

00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:59.760
really being really critical
of the person, not just what

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:02.512
they're doing, but also
contempt and disgust.

00:49:02.512 --> 00:49:04.220
And that can look a
lot of ways, from eye

00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:07.010
rolling to mockery to hostile
humor, all kinds of things.

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:09.410
Or just really going
at it this way at work

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:11.337
could be a pretty
big problem for you.

00:49:11.337 --> 00:49:12.420
But sometimes you want to.

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:13.510
You're just so mad.

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:14.510
You can't stand it.

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:16.010
It's like, they're
so bothering you.

00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:19.490
But part with that is to really
learn how to deliver criticism

00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:20.251
with a vision.

00:49:20.251 --> 00:49:21.750
Yes, I don't like
what you're doing.

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:22.749
You're driving me crazy.

00:49:22.749 --> 00:49:23.500
I hate it.

00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:25.340
And this is the
possibility I see.

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:28.050
So they know that you see
their higher self at the same

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:30.920
you're really frustrated
or angry with what's there.

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.770
But holding the tension
of both of those

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:34.119
is extremely important.

00:49:34.119 --> 00:49:36.160
And I'm going to go quickly
through a few others,

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.260
just to sum this up for
us and then look at this.

00:49:39.260 --> 00:49:41.220
Third rule, these are
about responsibility.

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:44.760
Nobody gets to take or give
more than 50% of the blame.

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:45.570
You can blame.

00:49:45.570 --> 00:49:47.220
But it takes two to tango.

00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:49.640
So this is really
important for us to see.

00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:52.370
So it's your fault. No,
it's your fault. No.

00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:52.870
Did too.

00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:53.492
Did not.

00:49:53.492 --> 00:49:55.450
How many of you have
still second grade fights?

00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:56.470
I still do with my husband.

00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:57.000
Did too.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:57.550
Did not.

00:49:57.550 --> 00:49:58.501
Did too.

00:49:58.501 --> 00:50:00.750
They're not terribly productive,
you may have noticed,

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:03.700
because they're
defensive and also blame.

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:07.230
So looking at this, what
could I have done differently

00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:08.570
in this relationship?

00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:11.600
How can I take my
50% of the blame?

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:14.250
What could I have said or
done or set it up differently

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:16.570
or made it more likely that
I get what it is I wanted?

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:18.760
Am I communicating
my expectations?

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.160
Am I training the people at
work in order to meet those?

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.660
Am I giving them
effective feedback?

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:25.020
Or am I just sitting there
resenting that they're not

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:27.820
doing what I want them to
do and being mad about it,

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:32.190
but not taking my 50% blame
and doing something about it?

00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:35.300
So related to this,
everybody, each of us

00:50:35.300 --> 00:50:39.350
is 100% responsible for our
own satisfaction and happiness.

00:50:39.350 --> 00:50:42.750
That's important that you're
100% responsible for creating

00:50:42.750 --> 00:50:44.230
value at this talk.

00:50:44.230 --> 00:50:45.390
I can't do that for you.

00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:46.190
That's yours to do.

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:47.640
I'll give you as much as I can.

00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.750
You're 100% responsible
for creating value

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:52.500
in your job, in your work,
on a date, in a meeting,

00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:53.460
in a conversation.

00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:54.240
That's yours.

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.180
You can do that.

00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:57.300
No one else can do that for you.

00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:59.426
And really, it's
so, so important.

00:50:59.426 --> 00:51:00.800
We had a woman in
our program who

00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:03.425
did our Signature program, this
Year of Transformation program.

00:51:03.425 --> 00:51:05.110
When she began, she was married.

00:51:05.110 --> 00:51:06.690
She'd been married
for 30-some years.

00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:08.231
And she would talk
about her husband.

00:51:08.231 --> 00:51:09.840
She called him whatshisname.

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.340
Whatshisname, I
never knew his name.

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:12.220
She said, well, whatshisname.

00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:13.219
And she'd kind of sneer.

00:51:13.219 --> 00:51:14.592
Whatshisname, da-da-da-da-da.

00:51:14.592 --> 00:51:16.550
And she was complaining
about him all the time.

00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:18.180
All he did was watch TV.

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:20.620
He wasn't supportive, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:22.890
She started to use these
rules of engagement,

00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:25.870
took her part of the blame,
took 100% of the responsibility.

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:26.910
It's pretty amazing.

00:51:26.910 --> 00:51:29.970
Two years later, now,
she's very deeply in love.

00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:30.770
So is he.

00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:32.270
He's had some health challenges.

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:33.850
She's been there fully for him.

00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:36.220
It's really been quite
an amazing journey.

00:51:36.220 --> 00:51:37.710
She cries talking
about him, she's

00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:39.720
so moved with her love for him.

00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:41.930
And he didn't do anything.

00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:43.020
He responded to her.

00:51:43.020 --> 00:51:44.710
She started taking--
of course he

00:51:44.710 --> 00:51:46.490
did because she was
changing the system.

00:51:46.490 --> 00:51:48.580
But she was taking
responsibility,

00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:51.460
going for being satisfied
instead of just blaming it

00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:52.580
all on him.

00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:55.360
And it really led to this
beautiful, satisfying

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.400
relationship.

00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.320
100%.

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:01.900
So if you see that, when
everybody at work, if everybody

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:04.480
is taking 100%
responsibility, what happens

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:06.730
is that everybody puts
together what they--

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:08.780
the solutions are
amazing when that

00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:11.770
occurs, that the creativity
and the problem solving that

00:52:11.770 --> 00:52:12.270
happens.

00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:13.740
We use this in businesses a lot.

00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:16.360
And it's really critically
important for what

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.210
ends up happening.

00:52:18.210 --> 00:52:19.900
So I'm going to give
you another one.

00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:21.108
Yeah, going for satisfaction.

00:52:21.108 --> 00:52:23.550
Express and agree
with the truth always.

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:24.320
Always.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:25.006
Do you know?

00:52:25.006 --> 00:52:26.130
And some of you are dating.

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:29.470
100% of dating couples lie.

00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:30.485
That means all of us.

00:52:30.485 --> 00:52:32.490
That means every
single one of us.

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:33.590
We don't tell the truth.

00:52:33.590 --> 00:52:35.548
We're trying to impress
each other or whatever.

00:52:35.548 --> 00:52:36.810
That causes a big problem.

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:39.050
So actually, telling
the truth, but also

00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:42.389
when someone else tells the
truth that you tell the truth.

00:52:42.389 --> 00:52:44.930
You remember, you acknowledge
the truth when it's being said.

00:52:44.930 --> 00:52:47.580
You take it in, that
you use straight talk.

00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.240
You're real.

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.020
You're genuine.

00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:51.260
You don't go around the bush.

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:52.460
You're just straight out.

00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:55.690
You give real feedback, and you
take it when it comes your way.

00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:59.650
It's very, very important for
us to be willing to look at that

00:52:59.650 --> 00:53:01.830
and to tell the truth,
to really tell the truth,

00:53:01.830 --> 00:53:04.399
to be willing to really say,
what so cross your heart.

00:53:04.399 --> 00:53:05.440
And I hope you don't die.

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:08.347
But just being willing
to do that in a way.

00:53:08.347 --> 00:53:09.930
Another one I'm going
to quickly go to

00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:12.190
is fighting for
something, not just

00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:14.060
against someone or their point.

00:53:14.060 --> 00:53:17.360
This is really important
because oftentimes, in conflict,

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.100
you start fighting
against somebody.

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:22.096
So if you can, in conflict,
remember what's your purpose.

00:53:22.096 --> 00:53:23.220
What is it that you wanted?

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:24.678
What's the outcome
that you wanted?

00:53:24.678 --> 00:53:26.050
What's your desired outcome?

00:53:26.050 --> 00:53:29.500
So you're not fighting
against someone or their point

00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:31.400
or just resisting,
but you're fighting

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:34.420
for what you yearn
for so that you

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:37.830
have a direction for
your conversations.

00:53:37.830 --> 00:53:40.920
And there's another,
huge-- assuming good will.

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:43.730
This one's a little tough
because in a relationship,

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:45.500
it's really hard in
a fight or conflict

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:48.000
or whatever to remember that
this is your beloved, that this

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.737
is your friend when you're so
mad, or so hurt, or so scared.

00:53:52.737 --> 00:53:54.070
They're not just out to get you.

00:53:54.070 --> 00:53:56.020
They're hurt and
angry or scared.

00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:57.950
And that's how it's
playing out of that way.

00:53:57.950 --> 00:54:00.890
And at work, rather
than assuming ill will

00:54:00.890 --> 00:54:02.760
and turning your boss
and your coworkers

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:06.630
into the ugly stepmother
and stepsister, to you

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:09.990
really show your belief
in them and encourage them

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:11.490
toward a higher vision.

00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:12.840
Try to assume the good will.

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:14.510
Look for it and it's there.

00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:17.380
And then you'll see them as the
people that they really are.

00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:19.380
And you can bring out
much greater gits in them.

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:21.250
Even when they have
a negative attitude,

00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:23.805
to see the possibilities
that are in that.

00:54:23.805 --> 00:54:25.680
This is another one
about assuming good will.

00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.138
I want to give you this one
because emotional intelligence,

00:54:28.138 --> 00:54:30.037
extremely related to
what I'm talking about.

00:54:30.037 --> 00:54:32.120
There's a part, I don't
know if you can recognize.

00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.812
When you really get
mad or really scared

00:54:33.812 --> 00:54:36.020
and your heart's beating
really fast, how many of you

00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:36.770
know that feeling?

00:54:36.770 --> 00:54:38.410
You're just taken
over in that way?

00:54:38.410 --> 00:54:40.440
You're really
flooded with emotion.

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:42.980
You're in this high
physiological arousal state.

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.060
If your heart beats
100 beats a minute

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.700
and you're not
working out, you're

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:49.260
under the influence of this
thing that's happening.

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:51.320
But what happens when
we're in that state

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:52.580
is we don't see what's there.

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:54.340
Our perception really changes.

00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:57.490
We start to see negativity
where it doesn't exist.

00:54:57.490 --> 00:54:59.690
We coat neutral
things with negative.

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:02.630
We miss 50%, at least,
of the positive things

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:03.840
that are going on around us.

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:06.280
And we need to know
that it's not real.

00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.484
It's just we're
clouded in that moment.

00:55:08.484 --> 00:55:09.900
If we train ourselves
harmonically

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:13.370
to look for what is there,
we can shift out of that.

00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:16.590
So I'm going to wrap this now
and bring some things together

00:55:16.590 --> 00:55:17.090
for us.

00:55:17.090 --> 00:55:21.040
But I want to look at all these
things that we've been looking

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:22.922
at, these rules of engagement.

00:55:22.922 --> 00:55:24.630
I'm hoping you can
find at least one that

00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:27.220
you could practice
today, this afternoon,

00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:29.277
tonight, throughout the
week, that you could

00:55:29.277 --> 00:55:30.860
take a little more
responsibility for,

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:33.942
a little more truth here,
maybe add a little positive,

00:55:33.942 --> 00:55:35.400
diminish a little
of that negative,

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:38.280
just even a little bit in
that way because what happens

00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:39.800
is we start to
then discover what

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.200
the true purpose of
relationships are,

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:44.850
that relationships aren't
there to make us happy.

00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:47.280
We should have some happy,
enjoyable moments, of course.

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:49.380
To share your life with
another human being,

00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:52.060
any other human being,
is a great, great gift.

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:54.940
But it really is to challenge
us and awaken us and help

00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:57.470
us develop into who we
could become, to grow

00:55:57.470 --> 00:56:00.730
and transform and realize our
potential, to serve as both

00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:04.250
the womb for nurturing us and
supporting us and soothing

00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:08.530
us and tending to us, but also
a crucible for growth so that it

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:10.620
keeps us on our edge
for what's possible,

00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:13.000
to be challenged
by it in that way,

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.460
to bust those myths and
beliefs that are limiting us,

00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:17.490
and to really believe
in the possibilities

00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:20.510
so that we can create this
heroic kind of love we talked

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:23.150
about earlier where
we tap that potential.

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:25.560
We're every day heroes,
sharing our deepest yearnings,

00:56:25.560 --> 00:56:27.760
telling deeper
truths, going for it,

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:31.280
taking risks, making mistakes,
engaging, encountering others

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.110
more fully, not
being so careful,

00:56:33.110 --> 00:56:36.350
being real, becoming a
transformation in ourselves,

00:56:36.350 --> 00:56:39.080
and then contributing to
transformational relationships

00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:41.600
wherever we are, being
that light in that way.

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:44.450
Being willing to engage in the
tough battles and conflicts

00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:46.834
and fight things through,
to get satisfied,

00:56:46.834 --> 00:56:48.500
and get to the deeper
truth about what's

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:51.220
really going on in that
way, to be on the cutting

00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:52.980
edge of possibilities.

00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:55.860
And this is the first time
in history relationships

00:56:55.860 --> 00:56:57.360
have been able to
get to this point.

00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:59.610
We had many other purposes
throughout history.

00:56:59.610 --> 00:57:03.430
Now, there's a potential for
both transformation and contact

00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:05.460
that we've never had
before, and that's

00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:08.000
going to be ours to do that,
and those that come beyond us.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.420
So I'm suggesting we
start it, that we become

00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:13.060
as real and authentic as we
can, and use these skills

00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:16.390
to do that, to be a new model
of intimacy and partnership

00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:17.780
in our lives.

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:19.760
And I want to wrap up
a little bit with this.

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:21.970
I know that it takes a
lot of skill to do this.

00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:24.690
I know in my own life, I am
continually learning new skills

00:57:24.690 --> 00:57:26.801
to do this-- and practice.

00:57:26.801 --> 00:57:28.550
And I would love to
support you with that.

00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:30.217
And I told earlier I
had a gift for you.

00:57:30.217 --> 00:57:31.091
Let me give you that.

00:57:31.091 --> 00:57:33.750
And so also for the livestream,
I'll give you a way to do that.

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:35.990
There is a flier and a
little card right here.

00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:39.160
We do a weekend training
in these skills,

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:40.245
which is really powerful.

00:57:40.245 --> 00:57:41.370
You have experiences of it.

00:57:41.370 --> 00:57:41.950
You learn about it.

00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:43.491
You're practicing
all kinds of things

00:57:43.491 --> 00:57:46.360
to really have these great
relationships and great lives.

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:49.120
Ordinarily, we would charge
$800 for this training.

00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.267
It's complementary
to all of you.

00:57:51.267 --> 00:57:52.350
I'd love to have you come.

00:57:52.350 --> 00:57:53.060
It's in Chicago.

00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:54.170
It's a wonderful place to visit.

00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:55.450
I would love to see you again.

00:57:55.450 --> 00:57:57.480
And all you need to do
is fill out this card.

00:57:57.480 --> 00:57:58.540
We do five a year.

00:57:58.540 --> 00:58:00.500
This would hold a space
in any one of the five

00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:01.260
that you could come to.

00:58:01.260 --> 00:58:02.676
You may not know
what that is yet.

00:58:02.676 --> 00:58:04.590
You can just put, I'll
check my calendar.

00:58:04.590 --> 00:58:05.780
Or I'll check it out.

00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:07.430
But by doing this,
you hold a spot.

00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:10.110
And I'll make sure that you get
your complementary admission.

00:58:10.110 --> 00:58:11.560
Also, we're doing a
raffle today because I

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:12.510
want to give you more support.

00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:14.100
We have some wonderful
prizes, some books

00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:15.600
and some other
things to give you.

00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:17.020
So if you fill
this out, then you

00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:19.057
can participate in
the raffle as well.

00:58:19.057 --> 00:58:20.640
And on the livestream,
let me give you

00:58:20.640 --> 00:58:22.597
a link that you can go to.

00:58:22.597 --> 00:58:24.430
This is the training
that I'm talking about.

00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:26.430
And you get these skills
of social and emotional

00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:28.294
intelligence to live
these beautifully.

00:58:28.294 --> 00:58:30.710
And on the livestream or if
you're watching this by video,

00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:32.409
you can go to this link as well.

00:58:32.409 --> 00:58:34.200
So if you take a second
and fill those out.

00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:37.500
And I want to make sure you get
your prizes before you leave.

00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:39.799
And Katie and Maria will
pick those up from you.

00:58:39.799 --> 00:58:41.590
And if you have any
questions while they're

00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:44.380
doing that, I would love to
entertain those before we take

00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:47.040
off, anything you want-- or
anything you want to say,

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:49.560
any genuine, real, truthful
thing you want to say,

00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:51.020
I'd love to you hear as well.

00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:52.720
RACHEL: I know
we're out of time,

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.463
but if anyone has
a burning question?

00:58:54.463 --> 00:58:56.277
AUDIENCE: Can we clap?

00:58:56.277 --> 00:58:58.110
RACHEL: No, we can give
a round of applause.

00:58:58.110 --> 00:58:58.600
Thank you.

00:58:58.600 --> 00:58:59.630
JUDITH WRIGHT: Lovely,
thank you for that.

00:58:59.630 --> 00:59:00.129
Thank you.

00:59:00.129 --> 00:59:01.874
It's been a joy to be with you.

00:59:01.874 --> 00:59:04.550
And again, if I can support you
in any way, I would love to.

00:59:04.550 --> 00:59:05.519
And let me know.

00:59:05.519 --> 00:59:08.060
I will be here to sign books or
answer any personal questions

00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:09.726
if you'd like, as
well, for a little bit

00:59:09.726 --> 00:59:11.490
before I fly back
to Chicago today.

00:59:11.490 --> 00:59:12.150
But thank you.

00:59:12.150 --> 00:59:14.100
Thank you for being in
a relationship with me.

00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:16.266
I really appreciate that
opportunity to be with you.

00:59:16.266 --> 00:59:18.420
So shall we go, love well?

00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:19.170
Are you up for it?

00:59:19.170 --> 00:59:19.710
Who's up for it?

00:59:19.710 --> 00:59:20.501
Let's go love well.

00:59:20.501 --> 00:59:22.516
Let's go love well and often.

00:59:22.516 --> 00:59:23.201
OK, great.

00:59:23.201 --> 00:59:23.700
Thank you.

00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:24.500
RACHEL: Thank you, Judith.

00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:25.190
JUDITH WRIGHT: And if you
want to give these cards,

00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:27.500
we'll make sure you hopefully
get your prizes quickly.

00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:29.950
And I'd love to see you.
