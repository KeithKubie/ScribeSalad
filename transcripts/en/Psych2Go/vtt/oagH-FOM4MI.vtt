00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.319
Hi, I'm Ella, today is my first day of work here.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.480
Great. Hey, I'm Davon. Let me get Rose and the rest of the team.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.440
Hey Ella, hope your coworkers haven't been scaring you too much. We're getting so busy here.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.140
So we're really glad that you're part of the team.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.960
I'm happy to be here.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.660
I actually got the offer on my birthday two weeks ago. So that was a very memorable end to my summer.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.160
Wow!

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.930
That's amazing.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.930
So say it's October 1st...

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.394
Ah, so your September, September 17th. Yep.

00:00:49.394 --> 00:00:50.744
I'm a Virgo, baby.

00:00:50.744 --> 00:00:51.719
Yeah a Virgo.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.219
I was gonna say that but I thought it might come off a bit weird if, you know, he's it

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.209
Uh, no or like horoscope stuff. Oh, I love it. I mean, it adds a tinge of mystery, comfort and interest in our lives.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.319
It's not that I get guidance from it to make decisions, but it's just...

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.809
Entertaining? It's so popular and widely available that it just became a habit for me to read.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.100
I read it when I see it on newspapers or come across post about on Facebook.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.680
And and yeah, it's actually a lot more than just the quote on quote "sun science".

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.309
I'm glad that somebody around you like to talk about horoscopes.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.380
Wait, are you seriously talking about horoscopes on Ella's first day of work?

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.779
You know when you're reading horoscopes you're sharing it with roughly 1/12 of the world's population, but

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.409
Come on, love what's wrong with little self-amusement?

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.180
That's fine. I've just skeptical of people who follow horoscopes literally word-for-word as a guide through life.

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.929
you know in psych class, we went over the barnum effect,

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.759
a Psychological phenomenon where people have the tendency to believe that personality descriptions apply specifically to them more so than to others

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.380
although the description is actually filled with information that applies to everyone.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.760
Oh barnum, I mean, yeah, you have a point there.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.860
Those are horoscopes bright. They're purposely written vague enough

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.140
so anyone can really fit and I to fight with them.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.580
Especially when the statements are phrased positively like you can be overly harsh on yourself and very critical or

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.560
Sometimes you can be loud outgoing and a people person but other times you can be quiet shy and reserved.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.220
A majority of the population would agree with those statements.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.940
Yeah, you're right, but also in my opinion,

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.440
astrology offers ideas. A lot of people like to dismiss it, just because well

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.640
It's quote on quote "not a hard science". A few years ago, the New York Daily News used to have a horoscope writer.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.720
I believe his name was Eric and I think he said it best when he mentioned that astrology is a branch of philosophy,

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.480
that the writing is more or less advice and well the advice is either helpful or unhelpful.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.480
It's subjective validation.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.819
I don't really understand why people get so upset over other people having interests in reading horoscopes if in all honesty.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.489
They're not harming others in any size shape or form.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.320
Okay, guys

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.729
it looks like we're all in agreement here. People like to read horoscopes for various reasons,

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.600
most of them being for entertainment, a conversation or even just to reflect.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.980
No personality test can fully capture everyone's character, but it doesn't make the assessments any less valuable.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.100
They do not claim to predict the future. It describes emotion and perception.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.860
Yeah, I get that.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.660
Daily sunshine horoscopes are inaccurate because they're for the masses and as humans.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.299
Well, we're way too complex to be pinned down by personality tests.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.050
But at the same time they can also be a tool for self-knowledge.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.630
It allows us to explore the gaps between what we know to be true about ourselves and what our test results tell us.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.230
What sign are you again, Hope?

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.860
Jokes

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.580
What's all this commotion here about horoscope talk?

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:57.519
His today a full moon or something?

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.349
We tried something different this time. What do you think? Could you relate to Ella, Davon, Hope or Rose?

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.850
How do you feel about horoscopes? Let us know in the comment section below.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.519
