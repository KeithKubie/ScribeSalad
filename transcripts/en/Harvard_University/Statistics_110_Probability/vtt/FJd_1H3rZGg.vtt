00:00:00.135 --> 00:00:00.810
SPEAKER: OK.

00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.830
So, as far as clarifications,
and hints and comments,

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.720
and so on on the homework, these
are kind of general comments.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.495
One is don't lose your common sense.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.820
That doesn't mean you can
rely only on common sense,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.790
because we're going to see over
and over again in this course a lot

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.020
of counterintuitive results that
may seem to defy common sense.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.770
But that doesn't mean--
just because we're

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.561
doing some counterintuitive
stuff sometimes

00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:35.360
doesn't mean you should
abandon common sense.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.660
And I also mean, I mean
this not only in terms of

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.390
do your answers makes sense, but also
just in terms of being reasonable.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.704
Like a couple of you asked about
calculators and things like that.

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:49.870
On the homework you can use
calculators if you want,

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.070
but it shouldn't be
necessary for the most part.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.861
Once in a while it will
be obvious that you

00:00:53.861 --> 00:00:56.380
should use a calculator for that part.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.240
On the exams, there's no calculators
allowed but also no calculators needed.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.630
So, either on the homework or on the
exam, you should use some common sense.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.970
For example, if you have 52 choose
5, it's perfectly fine to leave it

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:10.960
as 52 choose 5.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.960
Certainly on the exam,
common sense, I don't expect

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.450
you to compute 52 choose 5 by hand.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.060
On the homework, if you're
curious what the number is,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.880
you can do this very easily
using a calculator or a computer.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.580
But you can also leave
it as 52 choose 5, which

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.940
has the virtue of being what I call--

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.210
I call this self-annotating.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.689
Now, 52 choose 5, it's
some big number, right?

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.730
If I just gave you that big number,
it would be hard to know what it was,

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.200
but 52 choose 5, it's already making
you think, oh, this has something

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.880
to do with choosing 5 out of 52.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.250
So this is self-annotating,
which is good.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.520
You could leave it that way.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.700
On the other hand--

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.500
so this you would leave.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:57.430
But common sense would be, well,
if you have 4 divided by 2 times 1,

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.680
I would prefer, either on
the homework or on the exam,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.370
I would prefer that
you simplify it to 2.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:07.300
Occasionally, you may need
to add fractions, so 1/2

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.550
plus 1/3 I'm assuming you
can do without a calculator.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.790
But you're never going to have ugly,
tedious stuff on the exam, certainly.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.950
And if it's tedious on the homework,
then you can use a calculator for that.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.260
And that's also a hint.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.300
If, on the midterm or
final, you find yourself

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.209
doing all these massive calculations
with huge fractions and things

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.250
like, that then there's
probably something wrong.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.700
So that's just a
clarification about that.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.460
Second, useful throughout
the course, do check answers,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.320
and I'll talk more about checking
answers at different points.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.700
But just briefly, checking
answers does not mean go through

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.370
and look what you did
and say that looks OK.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.525
Like do the same thing twice, right?

00:02:56.525 --> 00:02:58.400
Because if you made a
mistake the first time,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.316
you're probably not going to detect
it when you look through it again.

00:03:01.316 --> 00:03:06.580
Checking an answer means trying
special cases, things like that,

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.860
thinking of another approach.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.260
A lot of problems can be
solved in more than one method,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.970
and if you get the same
answer, you're happy.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.530
If you get a different answer,
then you have to think harder

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.300
and you learn something from that.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.220
So the best advice for
this is, especially,

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.485
by doing simple and extreme cases.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.410
Like you might have a problem that you
have some answer in terms of n, and k,

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.370
and q, and w, and if
you plug in n equals 1

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.520
and it's completely obviously wrong,
then that's useful information, right?

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.030
But most students don't bother
to just plug in n equals 1

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.600
and see if it makes sense.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:55.530
So simple and extreme cases,

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.500
The third thing, I've never seen it
given a name or any emphasis at all,

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.510
but it's very, very useful to label.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:16.080
And let me tell you what I mean by
label people, objects, whatever.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.579
Let me tell you what I mean by that.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:24.480
So on a lot of the homework problems
and a lot of problems in this course,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.250
let's say, well, you have a group
of n people, or a group of n elk,

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.860
or gummy bears, or
something, and you're just

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.935
asking about this collection of
objects, or people, or animals.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.940
And all I mean by this is
just, if you have n people--

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.690
so the problem will just say we
have n people, blah, blah, blah--

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:56.750
then assume that they're labeled
with the numbers 1 up to n.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.780
Very, very simple, but
that's extremely useful.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.050
So basically, you have
this collection of people.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:06.450
Now, in the problem I'm not going to
give names to all of these n people,

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.527
and n could be a billion
or anything, right?

00:05:09.527 --> 00:05:12.360
But assume that they each have--
just think of this as an ID number,

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.027
or social security number, or whatever.

00:05:16.027 --> 00:05:18.110
So you definitely want to
do that with the people.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.030
That's going to be helpful with the elk.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:25.540
And you have a homework
problem about balls in a jar.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.420
There's a certain number of red balls
and a certain number of green balls.

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.700
It's very useful if you, for example--

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.500
you can choose your own notation.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.830
It's very useful, for example
though, you could say let's number

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.850
or label the red balls 1
through r, and the green balls

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.990
r plus 1 through r plus g, for example.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:49.730
You can do something like that, and
you're referring to specific balls.

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.610
Now, this might seem
very obvious, but I'm

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.190
stressing it just because
I've seen students

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:59.510
very often get confused because
they're not thinking of this labeling.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.420
And for people it's pretty clear.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.520
Even if you have identical twins, you
can still tell them apart in some way,

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.440
right?

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.400
So perfect sense with people.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.940
People start to get more
confused when we talk about this

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.760
for, like, balls and
the question is are they

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.800
indistinguishable or
distinguishable, and whatever.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.870
So suppose you have 10
green balls in a jar

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.980
and they all look
completely identical to you.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:35.390
I'm not actually saying that the
numbers are actually written on them.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.610
They may look completely
identical to you,

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.680
but the point is that, as far
as probability is concerned,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.120
as far as nature is concerned,
it behaves as if they

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.700
are distinguishable and labeled.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.260
And that that's going to
give you the correct answers.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:51.180
Whereas, if you just
say, well, they're there,

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.020
they're completely identical,
so they're indistinguishable,

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.290
you'll run into trouble.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.990
So it helps to think about the labeling.

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:06.690
And I think that is also relevant
for the robberies and districts.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.910
There are six districts, six robberies.

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.280
I think the best way
to think about it is

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.620
to imagine numbering the district's
1 to 6, number the robberies 1 to 6,

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.520
and think about it that way.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.390
Someone asked me whether robberies are
distinguishable or indistinguishable.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:28.660
Well, the problem doesn't designate
this robbery was this type

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.670
and this was this type.

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:33.330
They may look very similar, but
they're different robberies.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:37.230
They didn't occur at exactly the same
time, exactly the same circumstances.

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.310
There's something that
distinguishes them.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.240
You may as well give
each one an ID number,

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.990
as if you'll file a report on each one.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:50.472
You have robbery 1 through 6, and
thinking about how it will work better.

00:07:50.472 --> 00:07:52.680
We'll come back to this
issue of indistinguishability

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:56.280
later because it's
actually quite subtle.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.700
And just a quick clarification
about the problem about the teams

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.400
you're splitting up.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.070
I think it's clearly worded,
but just to make sure everyone

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:10.140
understands, if I say you
have 10 people and you

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:15.014
want to split them into a
team of 4 and a team of 6--

00:08:15.014 --> 00:08:17.430
let me just do as a quick
example because there's actually

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.150
some interesting things here.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:22.950
It's a bit of a hint
but it's also useful.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:29.040
So suppose we have 10 people and
I want to split into a team of 6

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.230
and a team of 4.

00:08:37.735 --> 00:08:40.500
And I want to know how many
ways are there to do that.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.340
Well, then it's just 10 choose 4.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:50.940
Because I pick the team of 4,
whoever's left is the team of 6.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.760
That's it.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.160
Of course, I could have
said pick the team of 6,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.860
and whoever's left is the team of 4.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.170
So I could have said 10 choose 6.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:05.100
We actually just proved that
10 choose 4 equals 10 choose 6.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.690
Because I just counted the same
thing in two different ways,

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:09.370
it must be the same.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.160
I mean, you can check this.

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.865
This is 10 factorial over 6 factorial
4 factorial, and so is this,

00:09:14.865 --> 00:09:16.430
so it's true.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.270
But we proved it just
by thinking about it.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:26.690
On the other hand, if we
wanted two teams of 5,

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:29.480
now if we just do 10
choose 5, we're going

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.290
to be off, because I
say pick 5 for one team

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:35.180
and the remaining 5 are the other team.

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:39.122
But if I had pick the remaining 5
first, that would have been the same.

00:09:39.122 --> 00:09:41.900
Because it's not like I said that
there's a team A and a team B

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:43.524
that have some difference between them.

00:09:43.524 --> 00:09:44.390
It's just two teams.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:48.390
So picking play, again
it helps to label them.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:51.050
So assume the people are
numbered 1 through 5.

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.580
If the teams are 1 through
5 and 6 through 10,

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.060
there's only one way to do that.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:59.180
I'm not designating some
distinction between the two teams.

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.490
Therefore, in this case it would
be 10 choose 5 divided by 2

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.922
because we've double-counted.

00:10:05.922 --> 00:10:08.630
Does everyone understand the
difference between these two things?

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:11.090
Here you're dividing
by 2, here you're not.

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:15.470
Because there is a clear difference
between a team of 4 and a team of 6.

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.950
While 2 teams of 5, unless
you said one team is

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.490
supposed to wear this jersey and
the other one wears this jersey,

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:25.140
it's equivalent.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.740
So that's a key, sometimes
subtle, distinction

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.630
that sometimes gets missed, so I
want to emphasize that a little bit.

00:10:31.630 --> 00:10:32.880
So there's a difference there.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:35.810
So you should think carefully
about issues like that.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.870
It's a little too simplistic to say
order matters or order doesn't matter.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:44.450
Well, what matters is thinking
in a way that makes sense.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.300
And for this homework, the
naive definition of probability

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.330
is enough for all the probability
questions, because that's

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:53.340
the probability we've done so far.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.340
But that doesn't mean you
can just naively apply

00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.430
the naive definition of probability.

00:10:59.430 --> 00:11:02.850
The naive definition assumes
you've broken up your problem

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:04.842
into equally likely outcomes.

00:11:04.842 --> 00:11:07.550
So if you break up the problem in
a way where they're clearly not

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.160
equally likely, then the naive
definition will not work.

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.210
So what I'm saying is, for every
probability question on the homework,

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:18.410
if you frame it in the right way,
you can apply the naive definition.

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.840
But you have to think hard
about making sure that it makes

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.385
sense to assume equally likely outcomes.

00:11:23.385 --> 00:11:24.260
Does that make sense?

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:34.900
So coming back to this sampling table.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.780
So I drew this 2 by 2 table last time.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.400
I won't draw the whole table again.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:44.020
But you can look it up in
your notes to refresh you.

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.060
Three of the four entries--

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.200
so the table had sampling
with and without replacement,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.000
and order matters or doesn't matter.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.640
And last time we talked
about the fact that three

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.170
of the four entries of the table are
obvious just from the multiplication

00:11:59.170 --> 00:11:59.860
rule.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:01.651
So three of the four
entries you could just

00:12:01.651 --> 00:12:05.320
fill in right away once you've
mastered the multiplication rule.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.250
The fourth entry is the tricky one.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:09.250
So that's the one that I
want to talk about now.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:12.590
So for the fourth one, I stated
the result. I wrote it down,

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.980
but it's mysterious where
it comes from, so I want

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.070
to show you where does that come from.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:28.855
So the problem is, we want to pick
k times from a set of n objects--

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.280
could be objects, people, whatever.

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:42.280
And we're looking at the case
where order doesn't matter,

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.910
and it's with replacement.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.030
That's the case we're interested in.

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.800
So we pick one of the n objects, put
it back, pick another one, put it back.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.940
Do that k times, but
we also don't care--

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.710
if we got that same list in a different
order, that counts as the same.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:07.510
So we want to count how many
ways are there to do this.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:17.630
And I stated last time that the answer
is n plus k minus 1 choose k ways.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:21.680
So I want to prove this
result and also give you

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.320
a little more intuition for it.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:29.180
The other three results should
be easy, but this one is tricky.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:33.590
But first, I should
follow my own advice.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.660
Let's see, is that plausible?

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.120
Let's check a couple of
simple and extreme cases.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.720
Well, the most extreme cases--

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.125
so extreme cases.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.350
The most extreme example I
can think of is k equals 0.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:56.100
That is, k equals 0 says
you don't do anything.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:57.510
So k equals 0.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.490
But let's just see if it makes sense.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:03.960
Assuming that this is correct, k
equals 0, this is n minus 1 choose 0.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.760
n minus 1 choose 0 is 1.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.940
For the same reasoning,
why is 0 factorial 1?

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.210
Well, I always think of factorial
in terms of if you have n people

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:21.800
and they're lined up for ice cream,
how many ways can you order them?

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.920
Well, if there is no one
there, there's one way.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.740
It's the way when there's no
one there, there's one way.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:29.600
0 factorial is 1.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.827
n choose 0 is 1 for any n, because
if you have a group of n people

00:14:34.827 --> 00:14:37.160
and you choose none of them,
there's one way to do that.

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.410
You just don't choose any one.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.790
So it's 1, not 0, is the key point.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:44.900
So if you had memorized
and then got confused

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:49.530
whether this was k or n, if you
put n here, then it would be--

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:53.900
but I'm changing k to n in my mind
and let that k be 0. n minus 1

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.230
choose n is zero, because you can't
pick n people out of n minus 1.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.160
There's not enough people.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.960
So the answer should be 1,
not 0, so that makes sense.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:10.790
Let's do a slightly less
extreme case than that.

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:13.110
Well, what if k equals 1?

00:15:16.998 --> 00:15:23.430
If k equals 1, then this would
just be n choose 1, which equals n.

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:25.480
Well, that makes sense.

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:27.390
You're just picking once.

00:15:27.390 --> 00:15:29.940
Notice, if you only pick
once, it makes no difference

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:32.004
if it's with replacement
or without replacement.

00:15:32.004 --> 00:15:34.170
It makes no difference if
it's ordered or unordered.

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:35.220
It has to be n.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:38.130
So there would be something really
wrong if we didn't get that.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:48.160
And let's do one other
case that is pretty simple.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.400
Let's do n equals 2.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.180
That's an interesting case for us.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:16:01.400
You can try-- n equals 1 is another
easy case, but let's do n equals 2.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:06.450
n equals 2 is what I would call
the simplest nontrivial example.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:10.530
One of the best just general pieces
of research advice in general

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:14.310
is to look at the simplest
nontrivial example.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.936
So this one is special in some
sense, simplest nontrivial.

00:16:17.936 --> 00:16:20.560
These ones are pretty trivial
but they're still worth checking,

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.184
because if they are wrong then
we know there's something wrong.

00:16:23.184 --> 00:16:31.060
This is the simplest nontrivial example,

00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:34.380
If n equals 2, according
to this formula,

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.805
this is going to be k plus 1 choose k.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:48.050
Notice k plus 1 choose k is the
same thing as k plus 1 choose 1.

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:51.409
Same argument as why is 10
choose 4 the same as 10 choose 6.

00:16:51.409 --> 00:16:53.450
You could choose the 4 or
you could choose the 6.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:54.470
They're the same thing.

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.980
This is exactly the same reason.

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.280
So that's the same as that.

00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:00.620
k plus 1 choose 1 is obviously
k plus 1, because you're

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:02.219
choosing one thing out of k plus 1.

00:17:02.219 --> 00:17:04.010
All right, now let's
see if that's correct.

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:16.349
We have n, we have 2 objects
and we are picking k times.

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:22.650
So let's just draw two buckets
to represent the two objects.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:27.390
And we're picking k times.

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:30.100
So let's just put a--
you can put a check mark,

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:33.960
but for simplicity I'll put a dot
every time I put-- this object 1,

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.300
this is object 2.

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.966
Every time I select object 1
I'm going to put a dot here.

00:17:38.966 --> 00:17:41.340
Every time I select object 2
I'm going to put a dot here.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.560
You can make up some
numbers if you want.

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.060
Maybe it looks like that.

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:52.190
I chose object 1 three
times, object 2 four times.

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:59.040
Since it's with replacement,
there's no restriction on how many,

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.640
as long as the total equals whatever
the total is supposed to be.

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.950
And since order doesn't
matter, I don't actually

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.170
care which dot came before which dot.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:11.370
All I care about is there's
3 dots here and 4 dots here.

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:17.370
Now, it follows from that that,
in order to specify this result,

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:22.470
all we need to do is say how
many dots are there in this box?

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:27.480
Because if I know how many dots are in
this box, then however many are left

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.220
are in this one.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:39.330
So the number of dots here, number
of dots, is in the set 0, 1, up to k,

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:42.420
because I have k dots.

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:46.190
In my example, k is 7, but
k could be whatever, k dots.

00:18:48.679 --> 00:18:51.470
So however many are in here-- it
could be that they're all in here,

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.350
or none of them, or anything in between.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:55.450
So there are k plus 1 possibilities.

00:18:55.450 --> 00:19:00.750
So just by thinking of this two
boxes, that gives a direct proof

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.560
that this is correct in this case.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:07.500
So that gives us some comfort.

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:10.470
And I'll come back a little
bit to this case, n equals 2.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:16.630
But now let's prove that this
formula is correct in general.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:25.830
Well, this dot picture is already
giving us a hint at the problem.

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.890
One of the most difficult and most
important things in this course

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:33.450
is to try to get in the habit of trying
to recognize pattern and structure,

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:35.820
that is, recognizing when
two problems are equivalent

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:37.820
even if they sound different.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.480
So that's not a calculus
thing, that's a thinking thing.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.550
You have to think hard.

00:19:44.004 --> 00:19:46.170
So the way to think about
this problem, the best way

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:50.070
to think about this problem is not
actually to think of it this way.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.970
It's to notice that this is
equivalent to having indistinguishable

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:57.120
particles in distinguishable boxes.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.660
So I'll just say this is equivalent, and
you can think through for yourself why

00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:01.860
is this the same thing.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.530
This is already giving you a hint
as to why this is equivalent,

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:07.350
but you should think about
why this is true in general.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:22.340
So equivalently, how many ways are there
to put k indistinguishable particles

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.050
into n distinguishable boxes?

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:29.750
So I'm thinking of these dots
as indistinguishable particles.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:34.730
The boxes are distinguishable because
this is box 1 and this is box 2.

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:46.545
k Indistinguishable particles
into n distinguishable boxes.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:56.560
And the answer is n plus k minus
1 choose k, but let's see why.

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.920
Another piece of advice that I could
have added there is draw a diagram

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.490
and try some simple examples.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.340
I mentioned the simple examples but
I didn't mention draw a diagram.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:14.800
I'm just going draw a picture
that should make everything nice.

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.540
So suppose we had--

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.960
that was a really easy case
where we only had 2 boxes.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:23.740
Well, let's boldly do 4 boxes.

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.960
I can do as many boxes
as I have space for.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.300
It's not any harder.

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.770
Once you see the idea, it
could be any number of boxes.

00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:32.440
But I'll draw a picture with 4 boxes.

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:39.490
Suppose that this box has 3
particles, this box is empty,

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:45.060
this box has 2 particles,
and this box has 1 particle.

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:53.840
So just for this picture, we had
n equals 4, and we had k equals 6.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:57.020
Just the number of
particles, number of boxes.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:58.840
And you could try to draw out.

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.590
I wouldn't suggest
doing it for this case.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:02.250
There's already too many possibilities.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:04.140
It'll be very tedious
to list them all out.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.940
But you could do one that's somewhere
in between this one and this one

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:11.050
and just try listing out the cases.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:15.950
Do an example that's simple enough
that's not too tedious just as a check.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:17.750
But here it's already
getting complicated,

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:22.880
because I can have empty boxes, I
can have all 4 over here, anything.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.940
Now, this idea of
indistinguishability, this

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.270
is in contrast to the labeling problem.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:33.540
So for most real, like, real-life
marbles and things like that,

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:36.845
it behaves more like that,
where you can label them.

00:22:36.845 --> 00:22:41.480
But for certain counting problems
and for certain problems in physics,

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:45.530
they are so completely
indistinguishable that you can't even

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:46.940
think of them as labeled.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:50.810
So, in other words, if I
swapped this one and this one

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:54.529
when you weren't looking, you
would never know the difference.

00:22:54.529 --> 00:22:56.570
But not only would you
never know the difference,

00:22:56.570 --> 00:22:58.790
god could not tell the difference.

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:00.620
That's this problem here.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:02.270
Now, usually that's not the case.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.691
So usually we can think
of labeling, where

00:23:04.691 --> 00:23:07.440
even if you can't tell the difference
god can tell the difference.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.080
That's the most common scenario.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:12.080
For some physics problems
it behaves more like this,

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.852
and also for some counting problems.

00:23:14.852 --> 00:23:17.810
I'm just emphasizing that this is
important in physics, but most of you

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:18.710
are not physicists.

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:20.187
I'm not a physicist.

00:23:20.187 --> 00:23:23.270
The reason I'm talking about it is not
because of the physics applications

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:27.020
but because it is
important for counting.

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:30.502
But for probability, usually
with the naive definition,

00:23:30.502 --> 00:23:32.210
you're not going to
be able to apply this

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:36.980
because it's going to function more like
the labeled case, not, like this case.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:40.370
So now, it doesn't look like we've
done anything except draw a picture,

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:45.650
but actually we're basically done
deriving the result. Almost done.

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:48.200
All we need to do is convert this.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.830
This picture will be kind of hard to
type up, even though you can draw this.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:55.540
Let's convert this into something
simpler that you could actually

00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:56.624
write down easier.

00:23:56.624 --> 00:23:58.415
So I'm just going to
make up a little code.

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.600
This is a very simple code.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:07.340
I'm going to represent these
dots by dots, so dot, dot, dot.

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.360
And then I'm not going
to draw these rectangles.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.820
I'm just going to draw separators.

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:20.000
So I'm going to draw a
vertical line segment

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.420
to denote the separators
between boxes, like that.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.640
So the second box was
empty, so therefore I'm

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:32.060
drawing two vertical lines
without any dots in between.

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:37.440
The third box had 2 dots, and
then there is a separator,

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.147
and then there's another dot.

00:24:39.147 --> 00:24:40.480
So does everyone see what I did?

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.870
So it's a very simple encoding.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:46.400
So notice-- I mean, I just
did this as an example,

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:52.130
but obviously, no matter what
configuration we had drawn here,

00:24:52.130 --> 00:24:55.040
that can be encoded in this way,
and you can go from here to here,

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.290
you can go from here to here.

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:59.005
It's just a different way to
represent the same situation.

00:24:59.005 --> 00:25:04.130
And once we have this we actually
are done, because in this picture

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:15.200
there must be k dots, because there were
k dots here, there must be k dots here.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:20.290
And there must be n minus 1 separators.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:24.080
That looks like a 1, but
that's a separator symbol.

00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:29.450
Because if I have n boxes, then there's
n minus 1 separators in between.

00:25:29.450 --> 00:25:34.394
Now, to specify this, how many
ways are there to do this?

00:25:34.394 --> 00:25:37.310
Well, you could think of it as like
the factorial of all these things,

00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:39.140
except that that's overcounting.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:42.762
It's similar to the problem,
like on the strategic practice,

00:25:42.762 --> 00:25:44.720
there is a problem like
how many ways are there

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.450
to rearrange the letters
of the word pepper?

00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:50.920
So it's not just the factorial of
the number of letters in pepper,

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:53.900
because there's multiple
P's and multiple E's and you

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.820
have to adjust for that overcounting.

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:56.780
Same as that.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:00.650
But an even easier
way to think of it is,

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:08.210
to specify this we have n
plus k minus 1 positions here.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:12.280
And in order to specify
our code, all we need to do

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.430
is specify where are the dots.

00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:17.500
Choose the positions for the dots.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.800
The remaining positions are the
positions for the separators.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:24.880
So n plus k minus 1 choose k.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.370
There isn't even anything
else I can write.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.120
This is self-annotating again.

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.350
I have n plus k minus 1 positions
here, and I'm going to pick k of them

00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:33.610
to put the dots.

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:40.285
If you want, you could also say this
is n plus k minus 1 choose n minus 1.

00:26:40.285 --> 00:26:43.197
Choose where the dots are and
the separators are determined,

00:26:43.197 --> 00:26:46.030
or choose where the separators are
and then the dots are determined.

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:47.830
Same thing.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:53.690
So that completes the
proof of that result.

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:56.060
So just coming back
very briefly to this n

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:59.620
equals 2 case, a case where
you could think of that would

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:03.505
be if you imagine flipping two coins.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.560
Usually, we think of
that as having four--

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.810
assume they're fair coins, so
heads and tails are equally likely.

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:17.630
Usually we think of four equally
likely outcomes-- heads heads,

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:21.340
heads tails, tails heads, tails tails.

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.710
So there's four of them.

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:30.760
Now, suppose the coins look
completely indistinguishable to you.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:35.020
Still, we could imagine that there's
coin number 1 and coin number 2.

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.090
Or, rather than thinking
of flipping two coins,

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:39.150
we could think of flipping
the same coin twice.

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:41.380
So we have the first
toss and the second toss.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:46.295
So even if the coins look the same to
you, we would think of four outcomes.

00:27:46.295 --> 00:27:47.170
Does that make sense?

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:49.294
Heads heads, heads tails,
tails heads, tails tails.

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:58.600
A massive controversy in
physics arose in the 1920s

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:07.450
when a young Indian physicist named
Bose proposed, not for coins--

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.820
he was doing a particle
physics problem--

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:13.150
but what he was saying
was equivalent for coins

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:16.030
as saying that there are only
three outcomes, not four,

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:17.340
and all are equally likely.

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.700
Because, in terms of
coins, we'll be saying,

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:25.450
well, either it's heads heads, tails
tails, or one head and one tail.

00:28:25.450 --> 00:28:28.090
And if the coins are
completely indistinguishable,

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:30.970
so you can't distinguish between
heads tails and tails heads.

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:33.580
So he was proposing a
model in physics, not

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:37.840
for coins, where there were three
equally likely outcomes, not four.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.330
And he basically got
laughed at for that.

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:44.230
But he wrote a letter to
a guy called Einstein,

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:48.340
and Einstein really liked the idea.

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:52.520
And then they were able to
finally start convincing people.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.802
That was in the 1920s.

00:28:53.802 --> 00:28:55.760
So they actually used
something-- and this just

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.370
looks like a simple
little counting thing--

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:59.940
but ideas along these lines in
physics, they used these tips

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:06.150
to predict a new state of matter
called the Bose-Einstein condensate.

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:07.930
They predicted that theoretically.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:10.360
It was only empirically
observed 70 years later,

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:14.710
so they predicted it
70 years in advance.

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:18.860
This is not a physics class, but you
can look that up if you're curious.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:22.210
It has all kinds of bizarre properties.

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:30.760
The point of this, though, is that, for
coins, the thinking of it as labeled,

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.610
whether you can tell them apart or
not, is normally the right way to go.

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:37.570
So this is useful for
counting and for physics,

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:40.030
but you have to be careful
about using this with the naive

00:29:40.030 --> 00:29:41.820
definition of probability.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:51.590
So let's talk a little more about
counting and what I call story proofs.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:59.580
So let's start with a simple example.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:11.760
So a story proof is still a proof,
otherwise I wouldn't call it a proof.

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:15.030
Someone asked whether
that means an example.

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:20.250
What it means is an application
or an interpretation.

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:24.420
So proof by interpretation,
I would say, rather than

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:28.170
proof by algebra or calculus.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:30.630
So there are some examples
on the strategic practice,

00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:33.840
and I just want to do a
couple more quick examples.

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:43.950
Then we're ready to go beyond the
naive definition of probability.

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:47.350
So proof by interpretation,
what do I mean by that?

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:49.530
Well, we already saw an example today.

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:53.330
We proved that 10 choose
4 equals 10 choose 6.

00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:01.290
So, in general, n choose k
equals n choose n minus k.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:04.960
That's a very useful fact.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.940
And I'm not going to
write the proof again.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.970
This one is-- so this is example 1.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:14.050
This one is easy to do
using algebra as well.

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:18.160
But it's even easier to just
say, well, if I pick k out of n,

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.280
or I could pick the other
n minus k, and you could

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.080
write one sentence explaining that.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.871
But I already talked about that,
so I'm not going write that again.

00:31:25.871 --> 00:31:27.760
It's the same idea.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.310
So this is obvious by the story.

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:35.080
The story is just the interpretation
that we are picking k people out of n,

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:39.310
rather than just thinking of this as
a formal symbol involving factorials

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:40.552
that you manipulate.

00:31:40.552 --> 00:31:43.510
That's actually thinking about what
this means rather than manipulating

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.320
factorials.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.720
That's what I mean by that.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:49.780
OK, let's do a slightly
harder one, and then one

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:53.475
that would be a nightmare using algebra.

00:31:53.475 --> 00:31:55.225
So here's kind of an
intermediate example.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.600
This is a very handy identity.

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:17.640
That n minus 1 choose k minus
1 equals k times n choose k.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:26.530
So I didn't memorize.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:31.300
I've used this identity
many, many times in my life.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:34.240
But I don't like memorizing things,
so I wrote this kind of slowly

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.000
because I didn't remember
it, I just derived it.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:47.390
Again, you can check this
by algebra pretty easily,

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:52.800
but that's not going to help you
remember it or understand it.

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.395
That's just like you could
write out the algebra

00:32:55.395 --> 00:32:57.020
and it will just look like a curiosity.

00:32:57.020 --> 00:32:58.820
Oh, it cancels out and so you know.

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:02.720
It doesn't give you any
intuition for why that's true.

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.870
So the story proof for this
would be to imagine that we're

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:11.090
going to pick k people out of n.

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:12.995
And, of course, it
doesn't have to be people.

00:33:12.995 --> 00:33:15.520
It can be whatever example
you want, but the point

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.020
is you're not losing any generality.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.650
I'm not saying 3 people or something.

00:33:18.650 --> 00:33:21.020
It's still a general interpretation.

00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:23.480
It doesn't matter that
I said it's people.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:32.476
Pick k people out of n, with one of
them designated as the president, say,

00:33:32.476 --> 00:33:34.100
or whatever you want to call the title.

00:33:36.742 --> 00:33:38.450
That is, you have a
committee and there's

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:44.732
a chair of a committee, or a president,
or whatever, the president of the club.

00:33:44.732 --> 00:33:46.940
So I want to know how many
ways are there to do that.

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:50.180
Well, there's two different
approaches I could take.

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:53.590
Either I could first
select who's in the club.

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:55.250
There are k people in my club.

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:58.150
There are n people in the population,
there are k people in my club.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:01.410
So I could pick who's
in the club, n choose k.

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:05.360
And then one of those k must be elected
as president, so we multiply by k.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.130
Multiplication rule.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.850
Choose who's in the club,
then choose the president.

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:11.090
That's this.

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:15.409
But I could also just say,
first choose the president.

00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:18.170
And then once I have
the president, then I

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:21.230
need k minus 1 more people
in my club, and those could

00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:23.484
be any of the remaining n minus 1.

00:34:23.484 --> 00:34:24.900
That is again the motivation rule.

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.940
They are the same thing.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.130
That's a proof.

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:30.620
That's a completely
rigorous mathematical proof,

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:34.610
but it also gives you
some interpretation.

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:39.710
So that's the kind of thing
that I mean, that we're counting

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.764
the same thing in two different ways.

00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:50.550
So if both ways are correct,
they must agree, right?

00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:52.570
So that's the idea.

00:34:52.570 --> 00:34:56.440
So count the same thing in two ways.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:35:06.820
And one more example that will be
useful several times in this course.

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.870
It's a handy identity.

00:35:09.870 --> 00:35:19.019
Suppose we had m plus n choose k,
and I want to write this as a sum.

00:35:19.019 --> 00:35:21.310
Usually, it goes the other
way around, that we're going

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:24.310
to see a sum that looks like this.

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:33.230
So we're going to sum j equals 0 to
k of m choose j, n choose k minus j.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:40.110
So suppose we have this sum, and we want
to prove that this sum just collapses

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:42.450
just to this one binomial coefficient.

00:35:42.450 --> 00:35:49.350
This is a famous identity in math
called Vandermonde's identity.

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:51.960
It comes up actually a lot
in different areas of math,

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:56.640
and especially in probability, but it
also comes up outside of probability.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:00.917
So if you try to derive this one
using algebra, it's pretty horrible.

00:36:00.917 --> 00:36:03.000
I mean, you write all this
in terms of factorials,

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.705
you can try to cancel stuff, but you
still have to deal with this sum.

00:36:06.705 --> 00:36:08.900
You can try to apply
the binomial theorem.

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:15.060
You can do a lot of stuff
but it's not easy at all.

00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:18.890
So let's prove this using a story.

00:36:18.890 --> 00:36:24.200
Well, here again, it's very helpful
that this is self-annotating.

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:29.950
You don't have to be that smart to think
of, well, this is m plus n choose k,

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:33.440
so I'm going to think about
picking k people out of m plus n.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.269
That's what it says to do, right?

00:36:35.269 --> 00:36:36.560
So that's what I'm going to do.

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:40.310
I'm going to pick k out of
m plus n, that's the story.

00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:43.070
Now I have to say, well, of
course clearly that's this,

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:45.380
but how does that
relate to the sum here?

00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:47.800
How does that relate to
picking k out of m plus n?

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:51.090
Well, m plus n is kind
of self-annotating also.

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:54.590
It means I have an m and I have
an n I added them together.

00:36:54.590 --> 00:36:56.130
So I'm imagining two groups--

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:59.400
a group of size m and a group of
size n, and together it's m plus n.

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.910
So that seems like a
pretty natural thing to do.

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:03.590
I mean, that's what m plus n means.

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:06.368
So we have a group of m.

00:37:06.368 --> 00:37:09.525
Here's m people.

00:37:09.525 --> 00:37:12.530
And I'm not going to try to
draw stick figures or anything,

00:37:12.530 --> 00:37:16.070
but these dots represent people,
not indistinguishable particles.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:18.480
So you should think of
these people as labeled.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.990
If you want, you can
call this person 1, 2, 3.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:23.030
So 1 through m are in this group.

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:25.550
And then n.

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:28.160
Maybe m is 3 and n is 5.

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.790
Here's n people.

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:34.910
So maybe I'll number these 1 through
3, and these ones are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:36.710
or however you want to label them.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:42.930
Now I need to select k people
from, total, from these two groups.

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:44.895
So maybe I picked--

00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:46.360
I'll just circle the ones I picked.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.060
Maybe I picked this one,
this one, this one, that one.

00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:53.830
I picked 4 of them, for example.

00:37:53.830 --> 00:37:55.010
Well, let's pick 5 of them.

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:57.170
There.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:59.210
So how many ways are there to do that?

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:03.780
Well, obviously I need to pick some
number of people from this group

00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:08.690
and some number from this
group such that the total is k.

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:14.000
So suppose that I picked
j from here, picked j.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.850
And suppose I picked--

00:38:15.850 --> 00:38:16.770
well.

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:20.360
So in this case j is 2, I
picked 2 from this group.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:23.690
I don't know why the
projector is going on.

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:27.960
I picked j from this group,
j is 2 in this example.

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.940
If I need 5 total and I picked 2
from here, there must be 3 from here.

00:38:31.940 --> 00:38:33.050
Obviously, right?

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:35.870
So this is just k
minus j from over here.

00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:38.330
If there's j here, there
must be k minus j here.

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:41.150
How many ways are there to
pick j here, k minus j here?

00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:43.190
Well, it's just this, right?

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:45.650
That's the multiplication rule.

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:46.760
Then we add those up.

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:50.370
We're not double counting anything,
we're just adding up disjoint cases.

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:52.440
So we just add them up and that's that.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.960
And that's the proof.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.700
That's it.

00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:01.770
Just writing up a few sentences
about that in words, that's a proof,

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:05.060
and it's a lot better to do it that way
than to try to do that using algebra.

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:12.850
So last thing for today is to
start, just very briefly start,

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:14.974
on the non-naive
definition of probability,

00:39:14.974 --> 00:39:18.015
and then obviously we'll be continuing
that for the rest of the semester.

00:39:18.015 --> 00:39:21.070
But I just want to get the
basic structure in place.

00:39:24.702 --> 00:39:27.570
So here's the general
definition of probability.

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:32.090
Up until now, we were assuming
equally likely outcomes.

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:33.340
And we want to go beyond that.

00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:35.730
We don't want to assume
everything is equally likely,

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:37.080
and we don't want to have to
assume that there are only

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.730
finitely many possible outcomes.

00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:41.340
We want to go beyond that.

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:45.690
So this is the non-naive definition.

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:52.035
For the non-naive definition, we need
the notion of a probability space.

00:39:55.830 --> 00:40:01.230
And I already introduced the
concept of a sample space.

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:13.040
So a probability space consists of two
ingredients, which I'll call S and P.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:18.620
And I just have to tell you what S
and P are and what rules they obey.

00:40:18.620 --> 00:40:21.560
So S-- the same notation
we used before--

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:23.990
S is a sample space.

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:27.450
Remember, that's just the set of all
possible outcomes of some experiment,

00:40:27.450 --> 00:40:30.750
and we'll interpret the word
experiment very broadly.

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:33.390
So S is a sample space.

00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:36.740
I already talked about what that means.

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:42.170
Up until now, we had to assume that this
was finite and that all of the outcomes

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:43.130
were equally likely.

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:45.140
And now we're going to
go way, way beyond that

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:48.510
and not have to assume that any more.

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:52.160
So P is a function.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.860
But it's not the kind of
function that you usually see,

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.590
like f of x equals x squared.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:08.085
The domain of P is all subsets
of S. So P is a function.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:19.374
It's a mapping that takes as
an input, it takes an event.

00:41:19.374 --> 00:41:22.540
Remember, we talked before-- and there's
also a handout that you should look

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:26.530
at, if you haven't already--
an event is a subset of S.

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:37.450
So P is a function which
takes an event, any event A--

00:41:37.450 --> 00:41:38.670
I'll just call it A--

00:41:38.670 --> 00:41:43.090
an event A, which is a
subset of S, as input.

00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:47.230
So an event is a subset of
S-- that's the subset symbol--

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:57.090
input, and gives P of A, which
is a number between 0 and 1.

00:41:57.090 --> 00:42:00.090
Because we want probabilities,
just by convention,

00:42:00.090 --> 00:42:02.250
standard convention is
that we want probabilities

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:04.330
to be numbers between 0 and 1.

00:42:04.330 --> 00:42:07.950
So the input is an event, the
output is a number between 0 and 1.

00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:12.640
So that's the output.

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:16.920
Now, the only thing left
is I have to tell you

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:20.150
what axioms does this have to satisfy?

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:23.610
In other words, what properties do we
need P to satisfy, aside from the fact

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:25.920
that it's between 0 and 1?

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:29.820
So you might think that a probability
is a very complicated thing,

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:33.070
like understanding uncertainty
is a very complicated thing.

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:38.520
But actually we only need
two axioms, two rules.

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:50.860
So such that, rule number 1, the
probability of the empty set equals 0,

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:54.190
and the probability of
the full space equals 1.

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:57.460
And you might say I cheated by
including two things in one.

00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:02.600
Actually, you can try to
simplify the axioms and derive,

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.380
and you could try to
derive this, but I'm not

00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:07.060
trying to make this completely minimal.

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:10.130
I like to write it this way
because these are the two extremes.

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:11.980
The probability of the
empty set equals 0.

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:15.530
That makes sense intuitively.

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:19.650
What would it mean for
the empty set to occur?

00:43:19.650 --> 00:43:22.200
We say that an event occurs if--

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.960
so our set up is we have this--

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.030
Venn diagrams are useful here.

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:30.850
S is like the universe
of all possible outcomes.

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:33.190
And we get one specific--

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:36.125
let's say this is A is this oval.

00:43:36.125 --> 00:43:38.000
And let's suppose that
s-- that's a lowercase

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.880
s but I did it big so that it's visible.

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:44.770
That lowercase s0 is an
example of an outcome.

00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:46.780
So our picture is, before
we do the experiment,

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:49.750
we just have this general sample space.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:52.630
After we do the experiment, then
we get to observe the outcome.

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:56.530
And suppose that the actual
outcome of the experiment was s0.

00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:59.470
Now, if that actual
outcome is an element of A,

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:01.660
then we say that A occurred.

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:06.190
And if this s0 is outside of
A, we say it doesn't occur.

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:08.840
Now, what would it mean
for the empty set to occur?

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.170
It would mean that this
s0 is in the empty set.

00:44:11.170 --> 00:44:12.610
But nothing is in the empty set.

00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:13.770
It's empty.

00:44:13.770 --> 00:44:15.910
So that's why I want this to be 0.

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:20.830
What that's saying is we want
impossible events to have probability 0.

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:22.320
This is impossible.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:26.530
This, on, the other hand, S
itself happens with certainty.

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:31.270
If somehow s0 fell
outside of that rectangle,

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:33.850
that would mean you had
the wrong rectangle.

00:44:33.850 --> 00:44:35.695
This is the whole universe here.

00:44:35.695 --> 00:44:37.120
So it can't be outside.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.930
So that's 1.

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:40.180
That's basically a convention.

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:43.857
The most important axiom is the second
one, and luckily there's only two.

00:44:43.857 --> 00:44:45.940
So you're not going to
have to memorize 10 axioms.

00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:48.850
It's just two simple rules.

00:44:48.850 --> 00:44:51.940
So, just very quickly,
the second one says

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:55.030
that the probability of the union--

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:58.710
so I'm assuming that
you know unions now.

00:44:58.710 --> 00:45:00.300
This is called a countable union.

00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:02.600
That is, I'm taking a
union of infinitely many,

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:06.180
but it's called a
countably infinitely many.

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:09.810
So the probability of the union
equals the sum of the probabilities.

00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:12.660
And there's an important
condition there.

00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:19.770
That's true if the A1, A2,
et cetera are disjoint, which

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:23.160
just means that no two of them overlap.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:26.040
So I'll just say non-overlapping.

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:29.100
So those are the two
axioms of probability.

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:34.050
And I find it pretty amazing that, from
these two simple rules, we can derive--

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:36.960
every single theorem and
result in probability

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:39.860
eventually follows from these two rules.
