(pulsing)

00:00:06.304 --> 00:00:07.137
- [Zac] Previously.

00:00:07.137 --> 00:00:07.970
- [Anderson] On Bro-Dependent.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.217
- [Photographer] Yes, that's yummy!

00:00:09.217 --> 00:00:10.050
- Zac!
- Hey!

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.508
- Something huge happened.

00:00:11.508 --> 00:00:12.341
- Cool story!

00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:13.575
- Get them off of my set.

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:14.705
- Click.
(laughs)

00:00:14.705 --> 00:00:15.748
- Fuck you guys.

00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:17.297
- [Man] That was funny as fuck, dude.

00:00:17.297 --> 00:00:18.486
- Yeah, dude, thanks.

00:00:18.486 --> 00:00:19.944
- Hey, do you like sex?

00:00:19.944 --> 00:00:23.095
- You wanna get into
bed with Quatro Cotton?

00:00:23.095 --> 00:00:26.345
- I'd rather just be business partners.

00:00:27.862 --> 00:00:30.953
Dude, this commercial shoot
is like, legit as fuck, dude.

00:00:30.953 --> 00:00:32.414
Nice production skills.

00:00:32.414 --> 00:00:33.963
- Oh, thank you, dude!

00:00:33.963 --> 00:00:37.060
- Hey also, it says this shit
has a secret sauce in it,

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.583
what is that?
- Oh, okay right,

00:00:38.583 --> 00:00:41.564
so I wanted to use like a
human growth hormone in it,

00:00:41.564 --> 00:00:43.818
but I guess you can't just buy that,

00:00:43.818 --> 00:00:45.812
so I used a little bit of my spooge.

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:46.770
- Oh!

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.853
(slurps)

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:52.580
Nice, dude, you can't
even taste it at all!

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.252
- So what do you say,
you're ready to, like, act?

00:00:55.252 --> 00:00:56.634
- Fuck yeah dude, let's do it!

00:00:56.634 --> 00:00:57.592
- Let's do it!

00:00:57.592 --> 00:01:00.342
Let's make some magic, fuckfaces!

00:01:01.368 --> 00:01:03.489
- Quatro Cotton, take one.

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:04.322
(claps)

00:01:04.322 --> 00:01:05.916
- And fucking go!

00:01:05.916 --> 00:01:06.804
- Hey Zac.

00:01:06.804 --> 00:01:08.881
I heard you were able to
have sex with your girlfriend

00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:10.216
two times in a row!

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:11.085
How?

00:01:11.085 --> 00:01:13.132
- Easy, Quatro Cotton.

00:01:13.132 --> 00:01:14.312
- Thanks.

00:01:14.312 --> 00:01:16.577
- Hey, I said I have a girlfriend.

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:17.646
Hey, what's up?

00:01:17.646 --> 00:01:21.514
I'm Zac Michaels, star of
daytime TV's Passions Palace.

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:23.648
When I'm participating in a fuck marathon,

00:01:23.648 --> 00:01:28.303
and/or doing anything else,
I always drink Quatro Cotton.

00:01:28.303 --> 00:01:29.828
What's in it, you ask?

00:01:29.828 --> 00:01:32.459
Easy, it's got Quatro energizing compound,

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:35.338
specially formulated
to get your shit right.

00:01:35.338 --> 00:01:39.505
Energy drink, secret sauce,
the can, and OxyContin.

00:01:41.884 --> 00:01:44.134
- Give me your wallet!
- No!

00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:47.389
Hya, hya!

00:01:48.765 --> 00:01:50.384
That was close.

00:01:50.384 --> 00:01:52.519
Thanks, Quatro Cotton.

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:54.247
Much like steroids, Quatro Cotton--

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:55.553
(phone rings)
Oh wait, shit, hold on.

00:01:55.553 --> 00:01:56.530
- Ugh!

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.749
Fucking cut, what the fuck, dude?

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:00.820
Zac, hello, that was the one!

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.802
- Relax your taint, Spielberg,

00:02:02.802 --> 00:02:05.636
it might be a text from Caroline.

00:02:05.636 --> 00:02:09.348
It's just like a photo
of some dude's dong.

00:02:09.348 --> 00:02:11.616
Whose dong is that?

00:02:11.616 --> 00:02:14.650
- Hi, some of the crew is
getting kind of hungry,

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.197
so we should--
- Okay, then can you tell them

00:02:16.197 --> 00:02:17.780
to go eat a dick?

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.057
- Oops.

00:02:19.057 --> 00:02:20.712
What the fuck does oops mean?

00:02:20.712 --> 00:02:22.307
- I don't know dude, she was probably

00:02:22.307 --> 00:02:24.152
sucking some guy's dick,
and then she accidentally

00:02:24.152 --> 00:02:25.210
sent a text of it to you.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.836
- Anderson, shut the fuck up,
you know you can't suck a dong

00:02:28.836 --> 00:02:31.195
and send a photo at the same time.

00:02:31.195 --> 00:02:32.517
- Can we please just do another take,

00:02:32.517 --> 00:02:33.600
we're losing the light.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.996
- Fine, where's my fucking robe?

00:02:35.996 --> 00:02:36.829
Huh?

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.078
- Where's his fucking robe, fuckfaces?

00:02:39.078 --> 00:02:41.568
Ah, what the fuck is that, dude?

00:02:41.568 --> 00:02:42.526
- [Zac] What?

00:02:42.526 --> 00:02:43.576
- [Anderson] That!

00:02:43.576 --> 00:02:46.602
- Oh yeah, it's the sweet
tat I got of Caroline's face

00:02:46.602 --> 00:02:49.337
over my fucking ripped-ass lats.

00:02:49.337 --> 00:02:50.984
I wish I could see it more, though.

00:02:50.984 --> 00:02:53.934
- Oh, it really looks like her face.

00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:55.545
- Yeah, we're like forever.

00:02:55.545 --> 00:02:57.031
Oh, you know what else is forever?

00:02:57.031 --> 00:02:58.345
- What?

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.169
- Diamonds, bitch.

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:01.731
- Who is that ring for?

00:03:01.731 --> 00:03:03.666
- It's for Caroline, you fucknut.

00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:06.506
(phone rings)

00:03:06.506 --> 00:03:08.677
It's another photo of a dong.

00:03:08.677 --> 00:03:10.541
This one's a black dong.

00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:12.075
The fuck is wrong with her phone?

00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:13.582
- She's fucking other guys!

00:03:13.582 --> 00:03:15.187
- I'm fucking warning you, dude.

00:03:15.187 --> 00:03:17.322
- Zac, open your eyes, dude!

00:03:17.322 --> 00:03:21.469
You're just like this dumb
little fly in her web of vagina.

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:22.823
- I said fucking stop!

00:03:22.823 --> 00:03:23.835
- Ow!

00:03:23.835 --> 00:03:25.287
Please, dude, I'm trying to protect you,

00:03:25.287 --> 00:03:27.343
she doesn't care about you!

00:03:27.343 --> 00:03:28.869
- Wow.

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:30.563
Fuck this, I'm out.

00:03:30.563 --> 00:03:32.071
- What?

00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:33.207
- What?

00:03:33.207 --> 00:03:34.834
- What?

00:03:34.834 --> 00:03:35.667
- What?

00:03:36.518 --> 00:03:37.654
- What?

00:03:37.654 --> 00:03:38.889
- What?

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.868
- No, dude, stop.

00:03:40.868 --> 00:03:41.826
- What?

00:03:41.826 --> 00:03:44.497
- That's our thing, don't
do that, stop it, man!

00:03:44.497 --> 00:03:46.323
- What?
- Stop doing that!

00:03:46.323 --> 00:03:47.906
Zac, please!
- What?

00:03:49.613 --> 00:03:50.696
- Fuck, dude!

00:03:52.167 --> 00:03:53.000
- Hey!

00:03:54.177 --> 00:03:56.401
- Oh, hey.
- What's up?

00:03:56.401 --> 00:03:57.849
My roommates and I used to get oxy

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.596
from my friend Chloe's boyfriend, but,

00:04:00.596 --> 00:04:01.607
then he OD'd.

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:03.557
(chuckles)
- What a pussy.

00:04:03.557 --> 00:04:05.137
What's your point?

00:04:05.137 --> 00:04:07.347
- Anyway, do you think I could buy some?

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:08.785
- Oh my God, yeah!

00:04:08.785 --> 00:04:09.679
Yeah!

00:04:09.679 --> 00:04:12.417
Totally, I'll put some
cans in like a box for you,

00:04:12.417 --> 00:04:13.250
that's awesome.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.964
- Actually, can I just get the oxy?

00:04:16.964 --> 00:04:18.574
- No, I'm not a drug dealer.

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:21.417
- Yeah, but, doesn't that
drink have your cum in it?

00:04:21.417 --> 00:04:23.731
- Fine, fine, that's fine.

00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:24.564
Thank you.

00:04:25.502 --> 00:04:26.890
Just sort of keep this on the down low,

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.338
but also, like, tell all
your friends, alright?

00:04:28.338 --> 00:04:30.233
- Yeah.
- Okay, great.

00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:34.588
And just take one of these,
okay, I'll just feel better.

00:04:34.588 --> 00:04:35.588
Great, nice.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.774
I'm a small business owner.

00:04:39.774 --> 00:04:40.607
I am a...

00:04:41.917 --> 00:04:43.394
The fuck, she gave me like three bucks!

00:04:43.394 --> 00:04:44.767
What the, what the fuck?

00:04:44.767 --> 00:04:48.267
(upbeat electronic music)

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:55.851
- Hey, thanks for watching Bro-Dependent,

00:04:55.851 --> 00:04:59.171
don't forget to comment and
subscribe ComedyCentral.com,

00:04:59.171 --> 00:05:00.801
on a serious note, though, you guys,

00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:03.339
like, OxyContin and energy drinks

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:05.507
are a diabolical combination, like,

00:05:05.507 --> 00:05:08.252
every year, millions of
Americans succumb to headaches

00:05:08.252 --> 00:05:12.571
and other, like, malaise and
tiredness-related activities,

00:05:12.571 --> 00:05:14.023
so just like, be aware.
