00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:13.110
That Time the Olympic Flag Went Missing for
77 Years and Turned Up in a Suitcase

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.549
The year was 1920.

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.370
The Summer Olympics were being held in Belgium
in the city of Antwerp.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.570
At the end of the Olympic Games, the flag
suddenly went missing.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:27.940
Fast-forward to 1997 and 101 year old bronze
medalist Hal Haig Prieste, who won his medal

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.489
in 1920 for platform diving, was being interviewed
at a U.S. Olympic Committee dinner.

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:36.980
During the interview, the reporter happened
to mention the missing flag to Prieste, who

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.609
then shocked everyone by stating, “I can
help you with that.

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:42.010
It’s in my suitcase.”

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.719
Prieste went on to reveal that he had been
dared by fellow diver Duke Kahanamoku to climb

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.820
the flag pole and steal the flag, which he
did.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.399
He then folded it and put it in the bottom
of his suitcases, where it remained some 77

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.399
years until he decided to reveal he had it
at the dinner.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.399
His reason for finally revealing he had it?

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.769
“I thought I ain’t going to be around
much longer – it’s no good in a suitcase…

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.230
I won’t be able to hang it up in my room.”

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.460
Prieste returned the flag to the IOC three
years later during the 2000 Olympics.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.930
It was in reasonably good shape, thanks to
the fact that it had stayed protected all

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.330
those years in the bottom of his suitcase.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.320
The only real damage to it was that the edge
was a little tattered from when he tore it

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.440
off the flag pole.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.360
The Olympic Committee went about restoring
the flag and put it on display in the Olympic

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.860
Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.820
They also gave Prieste a plaque thanking him
for “donating” the flag that he had stolen

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:42.130
from them all those years ago.
