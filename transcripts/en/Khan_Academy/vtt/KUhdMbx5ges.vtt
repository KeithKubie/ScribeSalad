00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.820
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.750
review all of the neat
and bizarre things

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.430
that we've learned
about triangles.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.470
So first, we learned--
so let me just draw

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.840
a bunch of triangles
for ourselves.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.140
So let's have a triangle
right over there.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.640
The first thing
that we talked about

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.710
is the perpendicular bisectors
of the sides of the triangles.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.880
So if we take, so let's bisect
this side right over here.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.379
And let's draw a
perpendicular line to it.

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:28.670
So this line right over here
would be the perpendicular

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.430
bisector of this
side right over here.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.820
So it's bisecting and
it is perpendicular.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.510
Let's draw another perpendicular
bisector right over here.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.350
So we're going to-- this is
the midpoint of that side.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.410
Let's draw a perpendicular.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.270
So this is perpendicular
and this length

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.390
is equal to this length, and
then let's do one over here.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.270
This looks like the midpoint
of that side right over there.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.710
And then we will
draw a perpendicular.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.160
It's perpendicular, and
we know that this length

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.320
is equal to this
length right over here.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.230
And what we learned is where
all of these perpendicular

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:05.630
bisectors intersect, and
what's neat about this,

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.004
and frankly all the things
that we're going to talk about

00:01:08.004 --> 00:01:10.990
in this video, is that they do
intersect in one unique point.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.320
That one unique point is
equidistant from the vertices

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.410
of this triangle.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.590
So this distance, is going to
be equal to this distance, which

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.750
is going to be equal
to that distance.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.900
And because it's
equidistant to the vertices,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.860
you could draw a circle
of that radius that

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.035
goes through the vertices.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.390
And that's why we call
this right over here,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.594
that point, that intersection
of the perpendicular bisectors.

00:01:42.594 --> 00:01:44.010
So let me write
this down, just so

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.600
that we can keep
track of things.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.853
Perpendicular bisectors.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:56.910
We call this point right
over here our circumcenter,

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.500
because it is the center of
our circumcircle, a circle that

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.264
can be circumscribed
about this triangle.

00:02:04.264 --> 00:02:05.430
So this is our circumcircle.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.210
And the radius of the
circumcircle, the distance

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.660
between the circumcenter and the
vertices is the circumradius.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.327
So that was the
perpendicular bisectors.

00:02:19.327 --> 00:02:21.410
Now the next thing we
learned, and the whole point

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.974
of this video is
just to make sure

00:02:22.974 --> 00:02:24.890
that we can differentiate
between these things

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.370
and not get too confused.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.210
So let me draw another arbitrary
triangle right over here.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.090
The next thing we
thought about is well,

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.084
what about if we were
to bisect the angles?

00:02:35.084 --> 00:02:36.750
So we're not talking
about perpendicular

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.330
bisecting the
sides, but we're now

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.760
talking about bisecting
the angles themselves.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.830
So we could bisect this
angle right over here.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.490
Let me draw my best
attempt to draw it.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.540
And so this angle is going
to be equal to that angle.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.190
We could bisect this
angle right over here.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.530
We could bisect-- I could do
a better version than that.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.440
So that looks--
well, one more try.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.880
So I could bisect it like that.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.210
And them if I'm
bisecting it this angle

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.310
is going to be
equal to that angle.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.920
And then if I
bisect this one, we

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.800
know that this
angle is going to be

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.280
equal to that angle over there.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.530
And once again, we have
proven to ourselves

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.110
that they all intersect
in a unique point.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.220
And this point, instead of being
equidistant from the vertices,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.636
this point is equidistant from
the sides of the triangle.

00:03:32.636 --> 00:03:34.010
So if you dropped
a perpendicular

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.000
to each of the sides.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.520
So this distance is going to be
equal to that distance, which

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.540
is going to be equal
to that distance.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.960
And because of that,
we can draw a circle

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.570
that is tangent to the
sides that has this radius.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.990
So we could draw a circle
that looks like this.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.590
And we call this
circle, because it's

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.860
kind of inside the triangle,
we call it an incircle.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.530
And this point,
we can call, which

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.690
is the intersection of
these angle bisectors,

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.370
we can call this the inradius.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.420
Now the other thing we
learned about angle bisectors,

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.280
and this we just
have to draw one.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.560
So let me just draw another
triangle right over here.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.560
And let me draw
an angle bisector.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.029
So I'm going to
bisect this angle.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.089
So this angle is
equal to that angle.

00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:23.130
And let me label
some points here.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.200
So let's say that this
is-- change the colors.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.470
Let's say that is A,
this is B, this is C,

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.810
and this is D. We learned
that if AC is really the angle

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:43.500
bisector of angle BAD, that the
ratio between-- that AB over BC

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.936
is going to be equal to
the ratio of AD to DC.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.050
Sometimes this is called
the angle bisector theorem.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:54.660
So that's neat.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.860
So the next thing we
learned is-- let's

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.230
draw another triangle here.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.190
This is just to be an
overview of everything

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.430
we've been covering in
the last few videos.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.640
So let me draw
another triangle here.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.090
So now instead of drawing the
perpendicular bisector-- so

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.880
let me label everything.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:08.965
This was angle bisectors.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.775
And now what I'm going to
think about are the medians.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.200
So the perpendicular bisectors
were from the midpoint,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.890
were lines that
bisect the sides,

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.570
and they are perpendicular,
but don't necessarily

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:28.720
go through the vertices.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.900
When we talk about
medians, we are

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.760
talking about points
that bisect the sides,

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.060
but they go to the
vertices, and they're not

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.230
necessarily perpendicular.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.250
So let's draw some medians here.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.210
So let's say this is the
midpoint of that side

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.530
right over there.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.306
So we could draw a
median like that.

00:05:46.306 --> 00:05:47.930
No, this is going
through the vertices,

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.270
these did not necessarily
go through the vertices.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.440
This right over here is not
necessarily perpendicular.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.970
But we do know
that this length is

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.940
equal to that length
right over there.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.770
Let me draw a couple of more
medians right over here.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.750
So this, the midpoint looks
like it's right about here.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.630
So this length is
equal to that length,

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.400
and notice it goes
through the vertex,

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.530
but it's not necessarily
perpendicular.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:16.160
And then this one--
see the midpoint

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.437
looks like it's
right about there.

00:06:20.437 --> 00:06:22.270
And once again, all of
these are concurrent.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.400
They all intersect at one
point right over here.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.150
And so this length
right over here

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.840
is equal to this
length right over here.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.010
There's a bunch of neat
things about medians.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.950
When you draw the three medians
like this, that unique point

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.987
where they intersect, we
called it the centroid.

00:06:37.987 --> 00:06:39.820
And as I mentioned, and
you might learn this

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.845
later on in physics, is if
this was a uniform triangle,

00:06:43.845 --> 00:06:45.720
if it had a uniform
density, and if you

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.900
were to throw it or
rotate it in the air,

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.440
it would rotate around
its centroid, which

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.222
would essentially be
its center of mass.

00:06:52.222 --> 00:06:54.680
It would rotate around that as
it's flying through the air.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.310
If it had some type of
rotational, or I guess

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.280
you could say angular momentum.

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.760
But the neat thing about this
is it also divides this triangle

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.990
into six triangles
of equal area.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.250
So this triangle has the
same area as that triangle.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.560
We proved this in
several videos ago.

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:16.590
Each of these six triangles
all have the same area.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.380
The other thing that we
learned about medians

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.940
is that where the centroid
sits on each of the medians

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.010
is 2/3 along the median.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:29.510
So the ratio of this side, of
this length to this length,

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.950
is 2 to 1.

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:33.520
Or this is 2/3 along
the way of the median.

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.550
This is 2/3 of the median,
this is 1/3 of the median.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:38.980
So the ratio is 2 to 1.

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.540
Another related
thing we learned,

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:42.600
this wasn't really
necessarily about medians,

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.180
but it's a related concept, was
the idea of a medial triangle.

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.370
A medial triangle
like this, where

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:54.260
you take the midpoint
of each side,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.040
and you draw a
triangle that connects

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.770
the midpoints of each side.

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:01.400
We call this triangle
a medial triangle.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.160
And we proved to
ourselves that when

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.130
you draw a medial triangle,
it separates this triangle

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.570
into four triangles that
not only have equal area,

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:15.110
but the four triangles here are
actually congruent triangles.

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:16.860
And not only are they
congruent, but we've

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.090
shown that this side is
parallel to this side.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.050
That-- let me use some
more colors here--

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:24.390
this side is parallel.

00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:26.980
Actually, I shouldn't
draw two arrows like that.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:28.770
That side is parallel
to that side.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.240
This side is parallel
to this side.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.179
And then you have this side
is parallel to this side right

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:35.679
here.

00:08:35.679 --> 00:08:37.530
And this length is
1/2 of that length,

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:38.947
this length is 1/2
of that length,

00:08:38.947 --> 00:08:40.363
this length is 1/2
of that length.

00:08:40.363 --> 00:08:42.080
And it really just
comes out of the fact

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.700
that these are four
congruent triangles.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.460
And then the last thing
that we touched on

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.330
is drawing altitudes
of a triangle.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.290
So there's medians,
medial triangles,

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:54.460
and I'll draw one last
triangle over here.

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.574
And here, I'm going to go
from each of the vertex,

00:08:56.574 --> 00:08:58.990
and I'm not going to go to the
midpoint of the other side.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.364
I'm going to drop
a perpendicular

00:09:00.364 --> 00:09:02.460
to the other side.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.160
So here I will drop
a perpendicular,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.640
but this isn't necessarily
bisecting the other side.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.440
Once again, going to
drop a perpendicular

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.780
but not necessarily
bisecting the other side.

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.830
And then drop a
perpendicular but not

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.120
necessarily bisecting
the other side.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.780
And we've also
proven to ourselves--

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.571
so these are the
altitudes of the triangle.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:28.155
And these also intersect
in a unique point.

00:09:28.155 --> 00:09:29.930
And I want to be clear,
this unique point

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.452
does not necessarily have to
be inside of the triangles.

00:09:33.452 --> 00:09:35.910
And the same thing was true of
the perpendicular bisectors.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:38.570
It actually could be
outside of the triangle.

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:43.420
And this unique point
we call an orthocenter.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.484
So I'll leave you there.

00:09:44.484 --> 00:09:46.150
And hopefully this
was useful, because I

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.940
know it can get confusing.

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:50.519
How's a median different
than a circumcenter, which

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:52.560
is different than an
orthocenter, or an inradius,

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:53.851
or any of these type of things?

00:09:53.851 --> 00:09:56.820
So hopefully this clarified
things a little bit.
