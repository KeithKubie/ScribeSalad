00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.450
Over the last four episodes, we’ve examined
some of the stories that make up the idea

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.959
of a “revolution” in knowledge-making
in Europe.

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.600
But we can’t understand this idea fully,
without unpacking another one—the so called

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.200
Age of Exploration.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.870
This encompasses a lot of events that happened
from 1400 through the 1600s and were driven

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.980
in part by new ideas about knowledge-making.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.060
And the span of history that we’ve been
taught as the “Age of Exploration” might

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.320
be better described as an exchange—the greatest
exchange of people, plants, animals, diseases,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.420
and ideas that the world has ever seen.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.580
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.540
Why did European explorers seek out the New

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.309
World after 1400?

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.350
And why didn’t they do it earlier?

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.519
Well for one thing, medieval European states
had been too small and poor to support large

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:58.519
navies.

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.280
For another, they didn’t have the technologies
that other Eurasian cultures had.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.140
By 1400, the compass and gunpowder had both
made it from China to Europe, changing armies

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.120
and navies across the continent.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.090
In time, political power became more centralized,
and states started to compete for things like

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.210
land and precious metals, and for valuable
trade routes to the rich empires of China and India.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.510
By the late 1400s, two European states in

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.680
particular began to use their massive naval
might to search out trade advantages.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.200
In 1488, Portuguese explorers became the first
Europeans to sail along the coast of sub-Saharan

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.200
Africa.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.020
And in 1497, Portuguese explorer Vasco da
Gama sailed to the Indian Ocean from Europe

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.159
by way of Africa’s Cape of Good Hope.

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.680
Interesting thing is, Portuguese ships were
smaller than Chinese ships at the time.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:52.390
Chinese explorer Zheng He, for example, explored
parts of Asia and Africa from 1405 to 1433,

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.859
with huge, four-tiered ships carrying hundreds
of sailors.

00:01:55.859 --> 00:02:00.421
But there was also a philosophical difference
in exploration between the two states: most

00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:04.950
people living around the Indian Ocean respected
overlapping political boundaries.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.229
But European states didn’t recognize other
states’ claims to their own territories.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.040
So it’s not that the Europeans had the best
ships; the difference was in how they used

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.040
them.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.000
The most famous European explorer, of course,
set sail on behalf of Spain in—you know

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.220
the year—1492, changing the world forever.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.830
In fact, historians call the widespread movement
of people, plants, animals, germs, ideas,

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.980
and technologies between the Americas and
Eurasia after 1492 “the Columbian Exchange.”

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.330
You can learn more about Christopher Columbus
in a lot of other places.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.880
For us, what matters is how knowledge moved
due to the Columbian Exchange.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.960
Now, what role did scientific thought play
in these voyages?

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.070
Not much.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.880
Gunpowder and the compass were not new in
1400.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.090
Centralized states were not new.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.520
These were just relatively new to Europe.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.700
It seems that, in this case, technology and
politics spurred science.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.070
The discipline of geography, for example,
became important when it came to settling

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.980
political disputes about who had claimed what
already-inhabited land.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.930
The Portuguese crown spent tons of resources
on making maps of lands that were new to them.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.330
And the Spanish government in Seville sponsored
the House of Trade in 1503 to make master-maps.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:21.590
In Spain, Philip II founded the Academy of
Mathematics in Madrid in 1582, where young

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.160
nobles could learn cosmography, navigation,
military engineering, and what were called

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.000
“the occult sciences”: kinda like "The Citadel" from Game of Thrones crossed with Hogwarts from Harry Potter.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.680
And, in the 1570s, Philip II sent out a scientific
expedition to the Americas under Francisco

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.900
Hernández to collect geographical, botanical,
and medical information.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.280
The later colonial powers—the English, Dutch,
and French—followed the Portuguese and Spanish

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.210
pattern of state support for science, focused
on geography and botany.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.150
Science became a tool of empire.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.450
But let’s be real: the “voyages of discovery”
weren’t full of scientists boldly creating

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.450
knowledge.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.340
These weren’t nerds like Galileo and Copernicus
obsessing over truth.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.790
These voyages were about exploitation.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.790
European powers -used knowledge creation as
another tool to fight proxy wars between each

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:10.790
other.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.790
By 1800, Europeans controlled 35% of land
and resources on earth.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:21.310
It was as though not one but five Roman Empires
had set off on a quest for world domination.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.940
So, what kinds of things were exchanged as
Europeans sailed farther?

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.150
For one, European explorers looked for new
plant specimens that might have agricultural

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.560
and medical uses.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.960
They were also interested in animals, but
plants were more important.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.010
Few animal species in the Americas had been
domesticated.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.900
Americans did carefully manage things like
ducks and vultures.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.030
But Europeans were amazed that Americans got
anything done without cows and horses.

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.590
On the flip side, edible plant diversity in
the Americas matched, if not blew away, that

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.590
of Eurasia.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.270
It was wondrous.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.270
Take us there, ThoughtBubble.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.590
Can you imagine a world without corn, potatoes,

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.360
tomatoes, bell peppers, chili peppers, beans,
tobacco, pumpkins, chocolate, avocadoes, vanilla,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.760
peanuts, pecans, cashews…?

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.670
I can go on.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:06.350
But really, no hot sauce!?

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.350
No chocolate?

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.350
No tacos?

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.350
No tomato sauce?

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.260
What did Eurasians eat before the Columbian
Exchange?

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.760
It doesn't even matter.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.460
In fact, there was so much knowledge about
plants coming back to European capitals that

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.740
old ideas about living things quickly started
to look… old.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.870
A few keen observers started to compare different
plants, part by part.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.440
The name to remember is Swedish natural philosopher
Carl Linnaeus, who came up with a rational

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.900
system for classifying plants based on their
sex parts.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.050
We’ll come back to him.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.700
How did plant specimens travel from the New
World to Europe?

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.780
At first, the English, French, and Dutch relied
on the Spanish and Portuguese for access.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.800
They quickly realized that it would be more
economical to set up their own exploratory

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.400
operations, and then their own colonies, including
slave-powered mines and plantations.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.950
For example, a Puritan “company of adventurers”
called the Providence Island Company left

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.030
England in 1633 for the eastern coast of what
is now Honduras and Nicaragua.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.470
They went with a specific plan to find useful
plants that they could sell or turn into new

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:07.470
products.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.970
The Puritans traded with the local people,
the Miskitu, who helped them identify the

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.970
local flora.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.880
But they never made a lot of money, so the
Puritans turned from botany to… piracy.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.210
They even got local Miskitu excited about
piracy!

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.680
They ended up stealing a bunch of enslaved
Africans from their Spanish rivals and then

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.120
executing Spanish soldiers who surrendered
after a failed attack.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.290
So the Spanish sent an armada of eleven ships
and took over the Providence Island Company’s

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:34.290
operation.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:36.540
You know, typical science problems!

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.650
Thanks Thoughtbubble.
In the end, empire turned out to be very uneconomical

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.630
for the states themselves.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:46.710
European corporations—some of which are
still around—made a lot of money, but only

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:50.370
because the states paid major costs to set
up colonies.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.900
These costs included both the capital for
ships, supplies, and sailors, as well as the

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.330
costs of fighting battles with other states
and subduing native populations.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.340
One consequence of discovering whole continents
full of new plants and animals was a new sense

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.140
in Europe of, well, newness—novelty, curiosity,
wonder.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:12.620
As more people learned about the New World,
they wanted to make more sense of it.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:18.260
So exploration led to the development of museums
and the practice of scientific collecting.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.990
Early museums were not like the ones we have
today.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:27.480
They were special rooms curated by nobles
called wunderkammern or “cabinets of curiosity.”

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:31.620
The ideal cabinet of curiosity had one of
everything.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.930
There was a divided focus between cataloging
the natural, the human, and the “abominations”

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.010
of nature such as dragons and mermaids.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.770
Wunderkammern brought order to an explosion
of new knowledge.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:45.770
But the order they imposed was highly individual.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:50.270
For example, you could often find a rhino
horn next to the horn of a supposed “unicorn,”

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.460
or narwhal.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.210
And every gentleman worth his salt had a crocodile
mounted on his ceiling!

00:07:55.210 --> 00:07:59.520
But other results of the Columbian Exchange
were not at all fun or wondrous.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.990
In addition to the intentional violence perpetrated
against native populations, disease played

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.800
a major role in changing who lived there.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:11.210
Human immune systems are adaptive: they learn
over time how to better respond to threats

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.699
from dangerous microbes.

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:13.800
Which is amazing!

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.890
But the populations of Eurasia and Africa
had been mostly separated from those of the

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.490
Americas and Australia for thousands of years.

00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:25.360
By a stroke of extremely bad luck, this meant
that the populations of the Americas had no

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.600
natural protection against smallpox.

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.620
As more Americans came in contact with more
Eurasians, smallpox ran rampant, killing one

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.579
out of every two people who caught it.

00:08:34.579 --> 00:08:38.089
This led to social breakdowns and meant that
native groups were less able to fight off

00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:39.300
European invaders.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.389
In some regions, populations fell by 75%.

00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:46.720
And smallpox was only the most deadly among
a number of diseases.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.350
Eurasians had developed some immunity to the
plague, measles, typhus, and tuberculosis.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.160
Africans had some immunity to malaria and
yellow fever.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.220
But the Americans had no immunity to these
diseases.

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:02.029
One notable disease that may have crossed
the other way—we aren’t sure—is syphilis,

00:09:02.029 --> 00:09:05.970
which first appeared in Europe three years
after the beginning of the Columbian Exchange.

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.790
The exchange of diseases also led to the exchange
of medical practices.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:14.740
In Boston, in the early 1700s, the influential
Puritan minister Cotton Mather learned the

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.790
practice of variolation from his slave Onesimus,
who later bought his freedom.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.199
Variolation is a way of protecting someone
against smallpox by deliberately infecting

00:09:23.199 --> 00:09:26.980
them with material from another person who
had survived the disease.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.300
This is different from vaccination, which
uses a similar but milder virus to trick the

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.899
body into fighting smallpox.

00:09:32.899 --> 00:09:37.790
Cotton Mather found the variolation worked,
and he actually tried to implement a variolation

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:43.459
campaign in Boston that was inspired by his
former slave, but most of Bostonites were

00:09:43.459 --> 00:09:44.459
not simply having it.

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:47.869
In addition to the fact that intentionally
injecting someone with powdered scabs was

00:09:47.869 --> 00:09:52.069
counterintuitive, most white people at the
time wouldn’t trust the medical knowledge

00:09:52.069 --> 00:09:53.149
of an African.

00:09:53.149 --> 00:09:58.589
Now, alongside trade wars, genocide, and disease,
another specter haunts the story of the Columbian

00:09:58.589 --> 00:09:59.589
Exchange.

00:09:59.589 --> 00:10:04.360
In fact, the economic metaphor of “exchange”
sounds ridiculous when you consider that the

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:09.790
European “explorers” colonized populations
they encountered in the Americas by force

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.959
and enslaved Africans and brought them to
the Americas to labor.

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:15.959
There’s a lot to say about colonization
and the slave trade.

00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:21.860
In terms of knowledge production, these practices
embodied Francis Bacon’s philosophy of instrumentalizing,

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:26.179
or exploiting, “nature”: the new world
and its peoples were resources to be used

00:10:26.179 --> 00:10:30.829
for the betterment of humankind, in this case,
meaning Christian humankind.

00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:34.550
Colonization and slavery also produced a series
of questions that natural philosophers would

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:39.660
obsess over for centuries: were native Americans
more “natural” than other peoples because

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:41.369
they didn’t have the same technologies?

00:10:41.369 --> 00:10:45.730
Did they provide a simplified and therefore
useful model of how societies function in

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:46.730
general?

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:50.579
These questions sprung from a deep misreading
of indigenous cultures, but at least they

00:10:50.579 --> 00:10:55.610
inspired a few philosophers to question the
naturalness of European ways of living.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:11:00.149
Questions also arose for the life sciences:
were the Americans, Africans, and Eurasians

00:11:00.149 --> 00:11:05.279
descended from the same ancestor, or had there
been multiple acts of genesis?

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:06.970
Was the bible literally true?

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:09.120
It didn’t say anything about a new world!

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.019
And questions about the Columbian exchange
still haunt historians of science.

00:11:13.019 --> 00:11:17.839
How did people in the “New World” understand
the arrival of Eurasians?

00:11:17.839 --> 00:11:19.749
What kinds of knowledge did they make?

00:11:19.749 --> 00:11:21.930
What counts as science?

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:25.829
Only recently have some historians started
to recognize the skills and technical knowledge

00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:28.050
of indigenous and enslaved peoples.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.480
This is an active area of research today,
and one we’ll return to.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.910
Alongside the “new science” created by
the thinkers of the Scientific Revolution,

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:40.320
the Age of Exploration created a new sense
of the new in Europe.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:45.189
It revealed a new world to explore, to map,
to find tomatoes and chocolate in, as well

00:11:45.189 --> 00:11:47.100
as to conquer and to enslave.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:52.139
No document captures this shift better than
the Nova Reperta, or New Discoveries of 1600.

00:11:52.139 --> 00:11:56.730
This series of engravings, based on designs
by the Flemish painter Jan van der Straet,

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:02.079
showed symbols of the Americas and the voyages
of exploration alongside stuff that was simply

00:12:02.079 --> 00:12:06.660
new—or stuff that actually had been around
in Europe for a while but suddenly felt

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.910
new, such as the compass, the mechanical clock,
and gunpowder.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:15.399
Next time—we’ll meet a humble farmer named
Ike who reimagined physics.

00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:19.139
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:12:19.139 --> 00:12:23.629
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:12:23.629 --> 00:12:24.629
Thought Cafe.

00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:26.119
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.029
