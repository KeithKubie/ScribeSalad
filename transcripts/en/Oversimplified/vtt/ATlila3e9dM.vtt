00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.020
Look at this baby.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.740
So gentle, so innocent.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.420
You'd think this child would grow up to become a good man, an honest man.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.380
Well, think again.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.040
*alarm sounds*

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.840
Hitler was born Adolphus Hitler in 1889 in a small town in Austria-Hungary.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.680
His father, Alois Schicklgruber, was born out of wedlock,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.200
but eventually changed his name to that of his stepfather, becoming Alois Hitler.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.320
Alois was a mid-level Austrian customs officer-- not really rolling in cash, but certainly rolling in women.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.760
He married a rich, older lady, but then immediately started having affairs,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.960
including one with a much younger house servant.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.360
A few years later, he left his sick wife to be with his mistress, but since the Catholic Church didn't allow

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.380
divorce at the time, he couldn't marry her.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.680
So he waited for his old wife to die and had a child in the meantime.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.220
Then his wife died, so he married his mistress and had another child, but then his new wife got sick,

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.800
so he employed his much, much younger cousin Clara to take care of her.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.900
Then when his new wife died, he immediately got Clara-- his cousin-- pregnant, and then married her...

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:59.800
in that order.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.980
(You rockstar.)

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.080
Clara and Alois had three children together who all tragically died while in infancy,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.620
so when the fourth child, Adolph, came along, Clara spoiled him rotten.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.640
The Hitler's had two more kids and the family moved around a few times,

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.220
meaning Adolph had to attend five different elementary schools.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.600
Adolph's father was strict, quick to anger, and took most of it out on the eldest son until he had enough and ran away at

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.179
the age of fourteen, leaving seven year old Adolph to do most of the chores and get berated by his father.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:32.040
The result was a difficult relationship with his dad while he was super attached to his mother who worried over him and his health excessively

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.360
Hitler did well in school. At first, his grades were good and his teachers praised him.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.019
He was popular with the other kids and enjoyed gathering them together to play war games.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.360
He also loved reading and particularly liked stories about Cowboys and Indians. As he grew older, though,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.710
he started to get into trouble.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.860
He was caught smoking once, organised a raid on a local orchard,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.670
tormented his pro-Austria religion teacher with symbolic gestures displaying his allegiance the idea of united germanic people under a greater german state and defines

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.299
of Habsburg Austria,

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.829
you know, the usual.

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:05.369
All of this enraged Adolph's father, who punished him severely. The area of Austria-Hungary that Hitler lived in was once part of the German Confederation,

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.509
and many of the people who lived there

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.318
considered themselves to be German. Adolph tended to just go against whatever his father said and since his father was an Austrian

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.760
Public Official, Hitler got big into German nationalism. This enraged Adolph's father, who punished him severely.

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.429
Around this time a family tragedy struck.

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:25.629
His six-year-old brother, whom he loved a lot, died of measles when Adolph was 10

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.328
and was buried in the cemetery just across from their home.

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:29.750
Around this time

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.379
neighbors reported a change in the young boy. Strange behaviors such as talking to trees and staying up late staring at the stars from the

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:41.679
cemetery walls. He lost interest in religion and his school grades started to decline which enraged his father, who punished him severely.

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:47.259
It also didn't help that he had just entered high school and the cool city boys treated him like a rural peasant he had to

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.649
Repeat a grade and had little interest in most school subjects instead spending his time reading and drawing which he was quite good at

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:00.129
One day his father said son someday, you'll be a big balls public official like me and Adolf replied, no father

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.839
I'm going to become an artist and soar high above the clouds with the eagles this enraged his father

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.439
But by this time he was an old-ass man

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:12.189
so he just sort of let it go and then died of a lung hemorrhage hitler just about passed his final semester and

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.119
Celebrated in the typical way by getting blackout drunk and wiping his ass with the certificate

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.109
However, he didn't take the overall final school exam instead

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:25.509
Just dropping out. the now 16 year old boy was unemployed without much purpose in life and for the next three years

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.949
He stayed that way he spent most of his time at the opera with his only friend August Kubizek

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.378
August Kubizek later wrote his memories of the Young Hitler and said he was passionately interested in many things, felt

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:39.369
he was in many ways better than others his age, was quick to anger just like his father, and an

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.280
Incredible speaker once he was ranting. when he was 18

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.619
He said a very sad goodbye to his mother and went to Vienna to take the entrance exam for art school he failed

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:53.049
Soon after he had to return home his mother was sick and her health was rapidly deteriorating

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:54.519
Hitler stayed by her side

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:00.158
And when she eventually died the family doctor said he had never seen someone so overwhelmed with Grief as Hitler was

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.879
Then Hitler returned to Vienna still hoping to find a career in the arts

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:09.399
But he never did instead without parental support hitler ended up on the streets now in his early 20s

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.109
He spent a few rough years living in and out of homeless shelters, making What little he could from selling postcards

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.649
He painted it's hard to pinpoint exactly when and how Hitler's extreme

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.099
Ideological beliefs formed, but his time in Vienna would have certainly played a role

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:26.259
Anti-semitism was widespread in the city the mayor whom hitler supported with an outspoken anti-semite

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.220
There were many right-wing

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.440
anti-semitic newsletters

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.259
Which hitler took a keen interest in he bought into the conspiracy theories and became a firm believer in the idea that there are many

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:42.370
Races and constant struggle with one another the purest of which were the German aryan people and the worst of which he believed were jews

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:49.239
Since Austria-Hungary was a multi-ethnic Empire full of lesser races hitler wasn't a fan. So when he was 24

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.720
He moved to Munich in Germany to avoid doing military service and for one more year

00:04:52.720 --> 00:05:00.129
He was a drifter on the streets until something huge happened. In 1914 long-standing tensions in Europe erupted into the first world war.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.789
crowds across Europe celebrated the news. Within days

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:09.879
Hitler volunteered for the German Army the war gave him a purpose in life his fellow Soldiers gave him friendship and Brotherhood

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:13.779
Despite the horrors of War Hitler considered it to be the best time of his life.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.250
He was reportedly a brave soldier and was awarded the iron cross first class

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.019
He was also very lucky and had many close encounters with death. His luck ran out in

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:29.379
1916 however when an artillery shell injured his leg he went back to germany to recover and was outraged to find a general

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:36.729
Apathetic anti-war attitude among the exhausted and hungry German populace with the war turning against Germany he returns to the [frontlines]

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:42.158
But was temporarily blinded by a british gas attack in 1918 a month later still recovering in hospital

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.740
Hitler Learned of Germany's defeat and Surrender

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:52.329
The terms of the peace treaty were tough on Germany it had to pay a lot of money and lose a lot of soldiers these

00:05:52.430 --> 00:06:00.279
Conditions weakened Germany and humiliated the German people. Europe's borders changed after the war too. New countries were formed out of Russia's lost territory

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.219
Austria-Hungary was dissolved and there was one big new country splitting Germany into two. Hitler, seeing the country

00:06:06.219 --> 00:06:09.099
He loved humiliated like this said that hatred grew in him for those

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:15.848
Responsible by which he meant communists and jews who he believed had stabbed Germany in the back by spreading dissent and Anti War Propaganda

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:17.919
back home.
