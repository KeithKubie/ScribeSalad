00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.710
There's a new reality television
program, and it's

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.410
called the Blue-- I should
probably write it in blue--

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.570
but it's called the Blue
Forehead Room.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.480
And what they do in this reality
television program--

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.730
and you'll have to bear with me,
because the show probably

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.650
wouldn't be that interesting
to watch-- but it's

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.190
interesting to predict
what happens.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.670
What they do is, they
take a room.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.930
They'll call it the blue
forehead room.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.695
And let's see, that's kind of
a top view of the room.

00:00:35.695 --> 00:00:37.300
And let's say there's
a door here.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.140
None of this is relevant
to the actual problem.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.880
This is the door, right there.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.050
And what they do is they get 100
perfect logicians to sit

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.220
in this room, in a circle.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:56.490
So they're all sitting in
a circle in this room.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:59.470
Now, before the game even
starts, before they even enter

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.629
the room the first time, the
logicians are told two things.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:15.910
They're told, One: that at
least one of you has your

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:17.320
forehead painted blue.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.780
At least one of you has your
forehead-- And they all get

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.600
their foreheads painted, so that
obviously if you're the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.810
only guy who has your
forehead painted.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.170
But you just don't know
what color it is.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.680
So all of them have different
color foreheads.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.760
Or, we don't know.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.230
But all they're told
is, obviously I've

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.370
painted your forehead.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.540
At least one of the people in
the room that you will enter

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.280
will have their forehead
painted blue.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.500
And then they're also told that
as soon as you deduce

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:04.980
that your forehead is blue, you
need to leave the room.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.880
And what's going to happen is--
and it's very important

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.910
that I set this up properly.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.680
They're all outside
of the room.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.090
No-one's inside the room.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.770
And let's say they're
blindfolded.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.860
And while they're blindfolded,
they essentially have the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.400
thing painted onto
their forehead.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.780
So they can't see the paintbrush
or anything.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.640
So they really don't know what's
on their forehead.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.330
And then after that, they
all enter the room.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.720
And they all sit in a circle
like this, so that they can

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.625
all look at each other.

00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:46.000
And let's say when they enter,
the lights are off.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.180
So the lights are off, and then
the protocol is that the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.610
lights will be turned on, and
then they can all look around

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.030
at each other.

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.540
There's no reflective
surfaces.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.400
They can't look into each
other's eyes and try to see

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.970
the reflection.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:00.810
No tricks like that.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.030
There are no mirrors
in this room.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.730
Nothing like that.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.440
All they can do is look
at each other.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.180
So, just as an example,
let's say that

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.860
this is me right here.

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.080
As soon as the lights get turned
on the first time, I'll

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.290
be able to look at all the
other people in the room.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.190
And I could see, it'll be pretty
obvious to me if anyone

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.100
has a blue forehead.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.550
Maybe that guy has one,
that guy doesn't.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.650
I don't know, right?

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.170
And I can see them.

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.160
I can't see my own forehead.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.460
And what happens is, then they
will turn off the lights, and

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.090
the way they're going to do it
is you have to leave the room

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.290
after you have realized that
you have a blue forehead.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.550
So for example, let's say I
enter into the room, and

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.530
because I'm a perfect logician
I see things that allow me to

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.890
perfectly deduce that I
have a blue forehead.

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.820
Then what they're going to do
is they're going to turn off

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.240
the lights again.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.900
And then, if I know that I have
a blue forehead while the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.080
lights are turned off, I
would leave the room.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.030
And then when they turn the
lights back on, I'd be gone.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.450
So there would be no Sal here.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.450
So let's say there were 100
before, then there would be 99

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.960
guys sitting in the room.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.200
Right?

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.090
As soon as I realize I have a
blue forehead, when the lights

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.740
get turned off, I leave. And
just remember these are

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:16.570
perfect logicians.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.990
So everyone in the room.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:19.910
And not only are they all
perfect logicians, but they

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.830
all know that everyone else
is a perfect logician.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:33.120
So, everyone is also told, and
this is true, everyone is a

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.440
perfect logician.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.285
Which means they have infallible
powers of logic.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.620
So my question to you-- Just
remember, I have each of these

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.030
perfect logicians.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.820
We set them up outside of the
room, paint their foreheads.

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.590
They're blindfolded.

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.840
They have no clue.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.010
Then we have all of them walk
into a dark room, sit in a

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.760
circle like this.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.240
And then what we tell them is,
as soon as you realize that

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.420
you have a blue forehead, as
soon as you have a blue

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.080
forehead, you have to
leave the room.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.810
Now my question to you is, let's
say that we've actually

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.580
painted everybody's
forehead blue.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.130
What happens?

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.650
So remember, this is what we've
told each of the people.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.930
Right?

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.030
As soon as you realize your
forehead is blue,

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.400
you leave the room.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.460
And now I've just asked you, the
producers like to really

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.740
play with these logicians.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.150
They've actually painted
everybody's forehead blue.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.090
So when everyone goes in the
room the first time, what's

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.900
going to happen?

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.400
Let's say I'm one of
the logicians.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.690
This is me right here.

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.990
As soon as I open my eyes, I'm
going to see 99 other fellow

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.680
logicians with blue foreheads.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.550
And then, maybe I can somehow
deduce something about my own.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.480
I don't think you can.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.340
And the lights will go off.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.950
And then if I haven't deduced
anything about my own blueness

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.770
of my forehead, then they'll
turn the lights back on.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.980
And then maybe some other
guy will have left.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.320
I don't know.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:12.080
Or maybe not.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.120
And then I'll see the
same 99 guys again.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.530
And that'll just keep occurring

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.630
until something happens.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.600
And my question to you
is what happens?

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.610
When?

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.860
And why?

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.760
I'm thinking whether I should
give you a hint right now.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.740
Well let me tell it
to you this way.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.650
That's the problem.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.800
You should be able
to solve it.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.810
And just so you know where this
came from, if I remember

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.740
correctly I think this was
on a computer science

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.150
exam I had at MIT.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.040
So just so you know, this
isn't just for fun.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.860
I don't want to go into all of
the applications that this

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.390
type of problem can apply to,
because that by itself would

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.620
be a bit of a hint.

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:56.110
So if you don't want a hint,
turn off the video

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.090
now or pause it.

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.990
If you do want a hint, I'm
about to give it to you.

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.440
So my hint is-- and remember
turn this off if you don't

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:11.560
want to hint-- but the hint is
what happens when there are

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.720
less than 100 people.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.080
So I gave the situation where
we have 100 logicians.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.050
But this problem is actually a
lot easier if you try it with

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.560
a smaller number.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:23.990
Anyway I'll see you in
the solution video.
