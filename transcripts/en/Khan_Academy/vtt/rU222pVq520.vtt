00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:02.390
Let's try to find the
limit as x approaches

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.120
1 of x to the third minus
1 over x squared minus 1.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.400
And at first when you just
try to substitute x equals 1,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.530
you get 0/0 1 minus
1 over 1 minus 1.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.870
So that doesn't help us.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.075
So let's see if we can try
to simplify this in some way.

00:00:17.075 --> 00:00:18.575
So you might
immediately recognize--

00:00:18.575 --> 00:00:21.270
so let's rewrite this
expression right over

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.010
here so it's x to the third
minus 1 over x squared minus 1.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.130
This on the bottom
immediately jumps out

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.009
as a difference of squares.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.460
So we know on the
bottom that this

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.750
could be factored as x
minus 1 times x plus 1.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.920
And so if somehow
this thing on the top

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.059
also has an x minus 1 as a
factor, then that x minus 1

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.600
will cancel with
this, and then we're

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.030
not going to have an
issue of dividing by 0.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.280
The reason why I care
about the x minus 1 term

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.160
is that this is what's making
our denominator equal 0.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.190
When you say x equals 1, you
have 1 minus 1 times 1 plus 1.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.240
So 0 times 2, it's this 0
that's making our denominator 0.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.980
So if we can have an
x minus 1 up here,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.470
then we can cancel these out
for any x not equal to 1.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.260
And then we might have
a much simpler thing

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.030
to find the limit of.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.670
So let's think about whether
x to the third minus 1

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.329
is the product of x minus
1 and something else.

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:25.870
And to do that we
can do a little bit

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.130
of algebraic long division.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.940
Some of you guys might already
recognize a pattern here,

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.740
but we'll try to do-- well,
let's divide x minus 1

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.880
into it to see whether
it divides evenly

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.620
into x to the third minus 1.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.560
So x minus 1-- we just
look at the highest degree

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.690
term-- x goes into x to
the third x squared times.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.374
Goes x squared times.

00:01:50.374 --> 00:01:51.790
Actually, let me
do it this way so

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.894
that way we can keep
track of the place.

00:01:53.894 --> 00:01:56.060
So this would be x-- this
would be the second degree

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.120
place, first degree place, and
this would be the constant.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.050
So x to the third minus 1.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.190
x goes into x to the
third x squared times.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.780
x squared times x
is x to the third.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.710
x squared times negative
1 is minus x squared.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.490
And now we're going to
want to subtract this.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.990
So we are then left
with x squared.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.320
x goes into x squared
x times plus x.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.580
x times x is x squared.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.487
x times minus 1 is minus x.

00:02:26.487 --> 00:02:28.320
And once again we're
going to subtract this.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.880
We'll swap the signs,
negative and positive.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.530
And so these cancel out,
and we're left with x.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.010
And then we bring
down a minus 1.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.300
x minus 1 goes into x
minus 1 exactly one time.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.840
1 times x minus 1 is x minus 1.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.850
And then you subtract, and
then you have no remainder.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.320
So this numerator
right over here

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:58.030
can be factored as x minus 1
times x squared plus x plus 1.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.140
And so we can say that this
is the same exact thing.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.210
We can have these cancel out if
we assume x does not equal 1.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:11.990
So that is equal to x squared
plus x plus 1 over x plus 1,

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.206
for x does not equal 1.

00:03:16.206 --> 00:03:18.080
And that's completely
fine, because we're not

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.050
evaluating x equals 1.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.810
We're evaluating
as x approaches 1.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.690
So this is going to be the
same thing as the limit

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:36.780
as x approaches 1 of x squared
plus x plus 1 over x plus 1.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.872
And now this is
much easier to find.

00:03:39.872 --> 00:03:41.330
You could literally
just say, well,

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.230
what happens as we get
right to x equals 1?

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.520
Then you have 1 squared,
which is 1 plus 1

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.420
plus 1, which is 3, over
1 plus 1, which is 2.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:55.390
So we get that equaling 3/2.
