Speaker 1:          00:02          You are about to decide the fate of this channel. You, I've been taking you guys seriously, really seriously. So many. Seriously, seriously though. Youtube data, bootcamps, strategies, big schemes, bigger dreams, hunched over that notebook, tongue hanging out, got those crazy. Don't mess with me eyes. Then you get up too fast and let your head who comes. We call that dedication. Speaking of splitting, should we stay one mixed channel or do you want to clearly separated channels? This is for real folks. Be honest now, genuine. Thanks for your opinion.
