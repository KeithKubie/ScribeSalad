00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
[Intro music]

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.280
Defense mechanism are the brain's ways

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.660
of keeping us safe from fully aware

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.680
of unpleasant thoughts and feelings.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.120
Sometimes, we can choose to use certain
defense mechanisms

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.600
like repression, denial and rationalization.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.280
Below is a list of ten of the most common
defense mechanisms.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.280
1. Displacement.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.380
The diversion of emotions such as anger,

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.260
from the original source to a substitute target.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.600
For example,

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.440
Your friend says something hurtful

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.360
and instead of confronting your friend,

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.720
you later lash out at your sister.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.880
2. Projection.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.940
The projection of one's own feelings,

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.300
thoughts or motives onto someone else.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.380
For example,

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.980
the person who is cheating

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.840
is under the impression that their
partner is cheating on them.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.340
3. Rationalization.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.240
Developing false though plausible excuses

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.720
to justify irrational and/or 
unacceptable behaviour.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.200
For example,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.600
Stealing from a corporate chain store

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.720
such as Best Buy

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.920
and justifying the theft by saying:

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.520
"They make millions in profit
so it doesn't matter"

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.040
4. Reaction Formation.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.300
Behaving in a way opposite
to how you feel.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.660
For example,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.420
When a person is romantically 
attracted to someone,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.860
but adamantly claims that
they dislike that someone.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.040
5. Regression.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.080
Reverting to childlike patterns of behavior.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.600
For example,

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.780
A student gets a bad grade on their test

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.280
and screams and cries at
their parents or teacher.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.260
6. Repression/ Denial.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.620
Pushing or burying thoughts and feelings

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.820
that are distressing into the subconcious.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.280
For example,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.720
An addict will deny they have an addiction

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.240
because they can function fine
at work and at home.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.160
An example of repression
would be a person

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.300
who witnessed a crime being
 unable to remember the event.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.640
7. Sublimation.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.320
The refocusing of unacceptable
impulses, thoughts and raw emotions

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.180
into more acceptable ones.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.520
For example,

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.220
A person who is experiencing
aggressive impulses

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.960
instead challenges that energy
into rigorous exercise.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.240
8. Dissociation.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.360
The detachment from the reality
and from oneself

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.100
and the finding of another 
representation of self

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.940
to cope up with extreme stress or conflict.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.580
A person uses dissociation 
as a defense mechanism

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.220
disconnects from the reality
and lives in their own world,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.020
in which they do not experience

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.840
unbearable thoughts, feelings or memories
for a period of time.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.780
9. Intellectualization.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.580
Overthinking and misdirection of focus

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.700
when confronted with unacceptable 
situations, behaviors or impulses.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.040
For example,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.320
A person who has been told
the close family member has died,

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.820
begins to focus on
and overthinks the details

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.660
of planning a funeral, etc, 
instead of expressing their grief.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.980
10. Compensation.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.220
The counterbalancing of perceived
 flaws or weaknesses

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.980
by instead emphasizing strengths.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.300
For example,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.300
A person says they can't draw

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.080
but they're really good at dancing.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.800
