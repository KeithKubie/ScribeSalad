00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.580
The largest insect ever found, and this home
was built on top of a missile silo, and would

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.789
be the perfect place for surviving a zombie
apocalypse.

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:15.650
Vsauce, Kevin here. This is Mind Blow.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.900
Twine is a wireless module that allows your
house to talk to you. It uses internal and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.380
external sensors to detect things like temperature,
moisture, and vibration, and can be used,

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.730
for example, to have your dryer text you when
your clothes are ready, or have your basement

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.429
email you if it's flooding. It doesn't require
a complex programming, just let it know, for

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:39.850
example, that when somebody knocks on the
door at a certain time, send a Tweet.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.850
This pin-press storage system is designed
to make cleaning up fun for kids. It allows

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.010
objects to be put away by pressing them into
the surface, and I kind of think everyone

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.519
should have walls made up of this stuff.

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:56.179
Slowmotion hard-boiled egg through a tennis
racquet.

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:01.170
To generate electricity while you walk, just
use these shoes. The concept allows a liquid

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.280
to flow back and forth between these bladders
while you walk, generating electricity and

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.430
storing it in a small battery which is accessed
through a micro-USB port in the heel.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.910
If you need a knew heel bone, this 3D printer
can make that happen. It prints bone scaffold

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.610
that can be used to encourage the growth of
new bone cells that can be fused with existing

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.790
bone tissue.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.030
SoftBot is a robot with no backbone at all.
It's actuated by harnessing compressed air

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.730
and channeling it through a valving system.
The idea is to allow this undulating and crawling

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.700
robot to enter narrow areas and navigate difficult
obstacles.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.230
Uh....

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.460
This Japanese astronaut shows us what playing
baseball by yourself looks like in space.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.380
And here's what eating food grown on your
own body looks like. The Yeti Crab is a species

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.700
of deep sea crab that grows bacterial meals
on its hairy claws. The bacteria is grown

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.230
due to methane gas released from cracks in
the ocean floor, so it's not using sun-fed

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:06.890
plankton for energy like many other marine
crustaceans. But, instead, uses chemical energy

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.409
from the sea floor.

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:14.720
If that's not alien-enough, there's Kepler-22b:
the only known planet to exist in a habitable

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.670
zone of a Sun-like star, meaning it's potentially
very Earth-like and only 2.4 times the size.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.590
This picture is an artist rendering and not
an actual photo because it's, uh, 600 lightyears

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.170
away...

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.500
Finally, here's a hypnotizing video where
an audio landscape is created, was the 138

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.209
DC motors, cotton balls, and cardboard boxes.

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:46.209
I'm gonna leave you with a shrimp and a Rubik's
Cube.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.030
There are four clues in the description of
this video. The first person to get all four

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.380
correct will be our genius of the week. So,
good luck. And if you notice I'm not in some

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.459
weird barn anymore, that's because I'm here
in Manhattan now working with Michael. And,

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.689
as always, thanks for watching.
