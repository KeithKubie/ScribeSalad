frozen solid in years past that would
 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.470
frozen solid in years past that would
have been solid block ice and as you can

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:41.480
have been solid block ice and as you can
 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.510
have been solid block ice and as you can
see there's a lot of open water and what

see there's a lot of open water and what
 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:45.610
see there's a lot of open water and what
that creates is a problem for the seals

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620
that creates is a problem for the seals
 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.950

this climactic change that's occurring

this climactic change that's occurring
so you know that particular animal

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:08.950
so you know that particular animal
 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:12.130
so you know that particular animal
survived and crawled out and made it but

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:12.140
survived and crawled out and made it but
 

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.840

so I think it was a story like this that

so I think it was a story like this that
 

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:23.080
so I think it was a story like this that
kind of opened my eyes to the the power

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.090
kind of opened my eyes to the the power
 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:25.060
kind of opened my eyes to the the power

environmental standpoint and what it

shortly after within a year so I

shortly after within a year so I
 

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.420
shortly after within a year so I
proposed this story about the global

proposed this story about the global
 

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:36.610
proposed this story about the global

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:43.590
mass harvest or slaughter of wildlife on
 

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.170
mass harvest or slaughter of wildlife on
the planet and I wanted to show things

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.180
the planet and I wanted to show things
 

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:47.210
the planet and I wanted to show things
like a long line this is an illegal long

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.220
like a long line this is an illegal long
 

00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.580
like a long line this is an illegal long

Cortez Mexico that was catching Dorado
 

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:54.470
Cortez Mexico that was catching Dorado
like this fish catching seven hundred

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480
like this fish catching seven hundred
 

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.070
like this fish catching seven hundred
tons of Dorado a day illegally that

United States I wanted people to know

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:01.260
United States I wanted people to know
 

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.260
United States I wanted people to know
what a long line looked like I wanted

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:03.270
what a long line looked like I wanted
 

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.910
what a long line looked like I wanted
them to see the most common method of

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920
them to see the most common method of
 

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.940
them to see the most common method of
fishing in the world which is a bottom

nets like this scour the planet this was

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:13.530
nets like this scour the planet this was
 

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.110
nets like this scour the planet this was
a small one that I photographed but you

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120
a small one that I photographed but you
 

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.850
a small one that I photographed but you
can see the method basically it's a big

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:16.860
can see the method basically it's a big
 

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:19.490
can see the method basically it's a big
net that has buoys on top of it and a

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:19.500
net that has buoys on top of it and a
 

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.650
net that has buoys on top of it and a
lead line on the bottom to keep it down

lead line on the bottom to keep it down
 

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.540
lead line on the bottom to keep it down
the buoy keeps the mouth open and these

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:23.550
the buoy keeps the mouth open and these

this was catching shrimp as it scrapes
 

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.610
this was catching shrimp as it scrapes
along the bottom to catch a few shrimp

this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner
 

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:11.120
this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner
about seven or eight shrimp and maybe 20

for shrimp so those are the things that

I thought this story might be able to do
and to look at gill nets also a very

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800
and to look at gill nets also a very
 

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.260
and to look at gill nets also a very
common method of fishing around the

common method of fishing around the
world this in this case I focused on the

world this in this case I focused on the
 

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.910
world this in this case I focused on the
shark fishing industry a hundred million

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920
shark fishing industry a hundred million
 

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.829
shark fishing industry a hundred million
sharks were killed on our planet

00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839
sharks were killed on our planet
 

00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:41.720
sharks were killed on our planet
every single year that's an

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:41.730
every single year that's an
 

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:43.610
every single year that's an
unsustainable rate these are the apex

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:43.620
unsustainable rate these are the apex
 

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:44.670
unsustainable rate these are the apex
predators in the sea

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:44.680
predators in the sea
 

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.500
predators in the sea
and you can't remove that without the

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:46.510
and you can't remove that without the
 

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.420
and you can't remove that without the
house of cards coming down and this

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:48.430
house of cards coming down and this
 

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.460
house of cards coming down and this
picture I thought would ended up being

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:50.470
picture I thought would ended up being
 

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:51.840
picture I thought would ended up being
the lead picture in the story because it

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:51.850
the lead picture in the story because it
 

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:53.639
the lead picture in the story because it
almost looked like a crucifixion you

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:53.649
almost looked like a crucifixion you
 

00:12:53.649 --> 00:12:55.590
almost looked like a crucifixion you
know it had this this personality to it

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:55.600
know it had this this personality to it
 

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.079
know it had this this personality to it
and maybe spoke to the the notion of a

00:12:58.079 --> 00:12:58.089
and maybe spoke to the the notion of a
 

00:12:58.089 --> 00:12:59.639

hundred million sharks being killed
around the planet another story that

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:01.540
around the planet another story that
 

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.570
around the planet another story that
appeared in the magazine last year was a

story we did called an Eden for sharks I

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:05.890
story we did called an Eden for sharks I
 

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:07.590
story we did called an Eden for sharks I
love sharks I love swimming with sharks

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600
love sharks I love swimming with sharks
 

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.600
love sharks I love swimming with sharks
and I wanted to do a story about sharks

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:09.610
and I wanted to do a story about sharks
 

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:12.660
and I wanted to do a story about sharks
and it occurred to me that to maybe get

00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:12.670
and it occurred to me that to maybe get
 

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:14.699
and it occurred to me that to maybe get
at the environmental angle of the

00:13:14.699 --> 00:13:14.709
at the environmental angle of the
 

00:13:14.709 --> 00:13:16.170
at the environmental angle of the
conservation angle we should look at a

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:16.180
conservation angle we should look at a
 

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.639
conservation angle we should look at a
place in the world where sharks are

00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:17.649
place in the world where sharks are
 

00:13:17.649 --> 00:13:19.170
place in the world where sharks are
still doing well because there are very

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:19.180
still doing well because there are very
 

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.230
still doing well because there are very
few such places left on earth so I went

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240
few such places left on earth so I went
 

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.820
few such places left on earth so I went
to the Bahamas a place that I had done a

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:23.830
to the Bahamas a place that I had done a
 

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:26.250
to the Bahamas a place that I had done a
lot of diving and it seemed to me that

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:26.260
lot of diving and it seemed to me that
 

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.630
lot of diving and it seemed to me that
this was one of the few places in the

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:27.640
this was one of the few places in the
 

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.430
this was one of the few places in the
world where sharks were still doing

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440
world where sharks were still doing
 

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.920
world where sharks were still doing
pretty well largely that that was

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:31.930
pretty well largely that that was
 

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:33.570
pretty well largely that that was
because of two things really it was

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:33.580
because of two things really it was
 

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.699
because of two things really it was
because of the geography the Bahamas

00:13:35.699 --> 00:13:35.709
because of the geography the Bahamas
 

00:13:35.709 --> 00:13:36.960
because of the geography the Bahamas
this is an aerial picture that I made

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:36.970
this is an aerial picture that I made
 

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:39.120
this is an aerial picture that I made
showing kind of a typical stretch of

showing kind of a typical stretch of
real estate in the Bahamas where you've

00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959
real estate in the Bahamas where you've
 

00:13:40.959 --> 00:13:42.870
real estate in the Bahamas where you've
got you know shallow sandy beaches and

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880
got you know shallow sandy beaches and
 

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:44.880
got you know shallow sandy beaches and
you've got mangrove nurseries and coral

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:44.890
you've got mangrove nurseries and coral
 

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.949
you've got mangrove nurseries and coral
reefs and in the deep blue water the

shark habitat but the other reason the

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:53.940
shark habitat but the other reason the
Sharks are doing well here is because

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:53.950
Sharks are doing well here is because
 

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:56.190

which is the the most common method for

which is the the most common method for
killing sharks around the planet so

be doing a little bit better here and

00:14:05.579 --> 00:14:05.589
be doing a little bit better here and

and on any given day I'd have a dozen of

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:04.510
and on any given day I'd have a dozen of
 

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:08.370
and on any given day I'd have a dozen of
them around me some days it got so crazy

I was using a macro lens I was using a

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:10.270
I was using a macro lens I was using a
 

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:12.120
I was using a macro lens I was using a
sixty millimeter macro lens to make

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:12.130
sixty millimeter macro lens to make
 

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.340

I mean sometimes they got a little too

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:19.450
I mean sometimes they got a little too
 

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:23.340
I mean sometimes they got a little too
close but that was just curiosity I'm

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:23.350
close but that was just curiosity I'm
 

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.100
close but that was just curiosity I'm
sure but but the truth is for this story

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:26.110
sure but but the truth is for this story
 

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:28.140
sure but but the truth is for this story
I really resisted the urge and the

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:28.150
I really resisted the urge and the
 

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:29.790
I really resisted the urge and the
temptation to make sharks look dangerous

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:29.800
temptation to make sharks look dangerous
 

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.680
temptation to make sharks look dangerous
I think there is a temptation for

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:31.690
I think there is a temptation for
 

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:33.600
I think there is a temptation for
photographers to go down that route

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:33.610
photographers to go down that route
 

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:35.519
photographers to go down that route
because it's not hard it's not hard to

00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:35.529
because it's not hard it's not hard to
 

00:15:35.529 --> 00:15:37.140
because it's not hard it's not hard to
portray sharks in in a threatening

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:37.150
portray sharks in in a threatening
 

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:38.730
portray sharks in in a threatening
fashion but I wanted them to just be

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:38.740
fashion but I wanted them to just be
 

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:40.500
fashion but I wanted them to just be
something beautiful just something that

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:40.510
something beautiful just something that
 

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.180
something beautiful just something that
was part of an ecosystem that they

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:42.190
was part of an ecosystem that they
 

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.640
was part of an ecosystem that they
happened to inhabit and this this series

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:44.650
happened to inhabit and this this series
 

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:47.250
happened to inhabit and this this series
actually kind of exemplified that for me

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:47.260
actually kind of exemplified that for me
 

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.660
actually kind of exemplified that for me
there was one day where I saw this

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:48.670
there was one day where I saw this
 

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:50.940
there was one day where I saw this
female tiger shark she was about 12 feet

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:50.950
female tiger shark she was about 12 feet
 

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.430
female tiger shark she was about 12 feet
in length and she was swimming on the

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440
in length and she was swimming on the
 

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.840
in length and she was swimming on the
bottom and then lifted up off the bottom

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:54.850
bottom and then lifted up off the bottom
 

00:15:54.850 --> 00:15:56.190
bottom and then lifted up off the bottom
and she had these three beautiful little

00:15:56.190 --> 00:15:56.200
and she had these three beautiful little

silver fish these bar jacks on her nose
 

00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:01.260
silver fish these bar jacks on her nose
so I sort of left the bottom in unison

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:01.270
so I sort of left the bottom in unison
 

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:02.730
so I sort of left the bottom in unison
and you know you never quite know I mean

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:02.740

dangerous shark in tropical waters the
 

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.470
dangerous shark in tropical waters the
second mode dangerous in the world so

closer she finally just turned and I

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:12.040
closer she finally just turned and I
 

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.500
closer she finally just turned and I
made this picture that just showed you

certain species of sharks upside down
and they go to sleep but the Sharks not

00:17:06.689 --> 00:17:06.699
and they go to sleep but the Sharks not
 

00:17:06.699 --> 00:17:09.990

weeks they conduct research out there

00:17:11.939 --> 00:17:11.949
weeks they conduct research out there
 

00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:12.600
weeks they conduct research out there
where they put

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:12.610
where they put
 

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:14.309
where they put
gill nets out to catch the baby sharks

00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319

at night they worked from about nine

00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240
at night they worked from about nine
 

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:17.460
at night they worked from about nine
o'clock at night till about nine o'clock

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:17.470
o'clock at night till about nine o'clock
 

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:19.770
o'clock at night till about nine o'clock
in the morning and they capture the

00:17:19.770 --> 00:17:19.780
in the morning and they capture the
 

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:21.630
in the morning and they capture the
Sharks and then the the PhD students

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640
Sharks and then the the PhD students
 

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.140
Sharks and then the the PhD students
will weigh them and through DNA samples

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:25.150
will weigh them and through DNA samples
 

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:26.220
will weigh them and through DNA samples
and then put them in this little

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:26.230
and then put them in this little
 

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.620
and then put them in this little
makeshift pen that they create and they

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:28.630
makeshift pen that they create and they
 

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.030
makeshift pen that they create and they
keep all the Sharks in there for about a

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:30.040
keep all the Sharks in there for about a
 

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.039
keep all the Sharks in there for about a
week or two and then release them all at

00:17:32.039 --> 00:17:32.049
week or two and then release them all at
 

00:17:32.049 --> 00:17:32.820
week or two and then release them all at
the end they keep them there because

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:32.830
the end they keep them there because
 

00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:34.140
the end they keep them there because
they don't want to recapture the same

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:34.150
they don't want to recapture the same
 

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:35.669
they don't want to recapture the same
one and that was interesting for the

00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679
one and that was interesting for the
 

00:17:35.679 --> 00:17:37.410
one and that was interesting for the
story I wanted to have some of the

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:37.420
story I wanted to have some of the
 

00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.150
story I wanted to have some of the
science in there but was what was more

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:39.160
science in there but was what was more
 

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.490
science in there but was what was more
interesting I think to me was to hike up

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:41.500
interesting I think to me was to hike up
 

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.350
interesting I think to me was to hike up
into the mangroves and get out into the

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360
into the mangroves and get out into the
 

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:45.330
into the mangroves and get out into the
wild you know to actually see some of

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:45.340
wild you know to actually see some of
 

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:47.789
wild you know to actually see some of
the sharks in their natural habitat so

00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:47.799
the sharks in their natural habitat so
 

00:17:47.799 --> 00:17:49.320

eventually you know they did and they
 

00:18:05.559 --> 00:18:06.930
eventually you know they did and they
would come close and I was able to make

00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:06.940
would come close and I was able to make

on for this story was the oceanic

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:12.820
on for this story was the oceanic
 

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.210
on for this story was the oceanic
whitetip shark which is considered the

whitetip shark which is considered the
 

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:16.860
whitetip shark which is considered the
fourth the most dangerous species of

shark in the ocean but unfortunately
 

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:21.870

it's 98% in decline throughout most of
its range just a very sad story I went

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:24.610
its range just a very sad story I went
 

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:25.890
its range just a very sad story I went
to a place in the Bahamas

00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:25.900
to a place in the Bahamas
 

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.270
to a place in the Bahamas
where we had heard rumors that they were

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280
where we had heard rumors that they were

were oceanic whitetips so in 16 days I

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:35.680
were oceanic whitetips so in 16 days I
 

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:37.800
were oceanic whitetips so in 16 days I
only had one day where we had this

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:37.810
only had one day where we had this
 

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:40.050
only had one day where we had this
beautiful nine-foot female that that

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:40.060
beautiful nine-foot female that that
 

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:42.210
beautiful nine-foot female that that
came in and and stayed around for about

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:42.220
came in and and stayed around for about
 

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:44.100
came in and and stayed around for about
two hours because they're considered a

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:44.110
two hours because they're considered a
 

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:45.570
two hours because they're considered a
very dangerous species of shark and

00:19:45.570 --> 00:19:45.580
very dangerous species of shark and
 

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.100
very dangerous species of shark and
because we weren't working on the bottom

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:47.110
because we weren't working on the bottom
 

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.540
because we weren't working on the bottom
we were working up in the water column I

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:48.550
we were working up in the water column I
 

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.430
we were working up in the water column I
brought along a shark cage and this is

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:50.440
brought along a shark cage and this is

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.440
off of Canada and towed into Nova Scotia
and all the skin had had sort of burned

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:03.450
and all the skin had had sort of burned
 

00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:05.390
and all the skin had had sort of burned
off and Sheba the white body became

00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400
off and Sheba the white body became
 

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.400
off and Sheba the white body became
sunburned and what they typically do

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:07.410
sunburned and what they typically do
 

00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:09.410
sunburned and what they typically do
when they tell a right whale in like

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:09.420
when they tell a right whale in like
 

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.419
when they tell a right whale in like
this they do a necropsy it's like a type

00:23:11.419 --> 00:23:11.429
this they do a necropsy it's like a type
 

00:23:11.429 --> 00:23:13.400
this they do a necropsy it's like a type
of autopsy to determine the cause of

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:13.410
of autopsy to determine the cause of
 

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.320
of autopsy to determine the cause of
death so with this one they they

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:15.330
death so with this one they they
 

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:16.430
death so with this one they they
actually have to use like heavy

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:16.440
actually have to use like heavy
 

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.560

up on the beach and then the scientist

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:20.040
up on the beach and then the scientist
 

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.919
up on the beach and then the scientist
from Woods Hole began the process of

00:23:21.919 --> 00:23:21.929
from Woods Hole began the process of
 

00:23:21.929 --> 00:23:24.020
from Woods Hole began the process of
cutting off the head and flexing it and

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:24.030
cutting off the head and flexing it and
 

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.880
cutting off the head and flexing it and
getting it down to the skeletal remains

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:25.890
getting it down to the skeletal remains
 

00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:29.540
getting it down to the skeletal remains
to see exactly what caused the animal to

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:29.550
to see exactly what caused the animal to
 

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:31.730
to see exactly what caused the animal to
die and in this case they reassembled

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:31.740
die and in this case they reassembled
 

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.620
die and in this case they reassembled
the skeleton here the the vertebrae and

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:33.630
the skeleton here the the vertebrae and
 

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:35.720
the skeleton here the the vertebrae and
those pieces on the grass are the

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:35.730
those pieces on the grass are the
 

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.430
those pieces on the grass are the
transverse processes there were eight of

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440
transverse processes there were eight of
 

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:39.169
transverse processes there were eight of
them that were supposed to be part of

00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:39.179
them that were supposed to be part of
 

00:23:39.179 --> 00:23:40.910
them that were supposed to be part of
that spinal column there all of them

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:40.920
that spinal column there all of them
 

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.160
that spinal column there all of them
were snapped off in a very blunt trauma

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:43.170
were snapped off in a very blunt trauma
 

00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:44.990
were snapped off in a very blunt trauma
which clearly was a ship strike so

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000
which clearly was a ship strike so
 

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.850
which clearly was a ship strike so
there's no doubt about what caused this

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:46.860
there's no doubt about what caused this
 

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:48.530
there's no doubt about what caused this
animal to die it was a collision with a

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:48.540
animal to die it was a collision with a
 

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:49.139
animal to die it was a collision with a
ship

and it was the worst of all cases

00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799
and it was the worst of all cases
 

00:23:50.799 --> 00:23:53.669
and it was the worst of all cases
because this was an adult female that we

00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679
because this was an adult female that we
 

00:23:53.679 --> 00:23:55.320
because this was an adult female that we
don't want to lose not that we would

don't want to lose not that we would
 

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:56.759
don't want to lose not that we would
want to lose any but the females of

we can just save two right whales a year

00:24:00.329 --> 00:24:00.339
we can just save two right whales a year

we can just save two right whales a year
in the North Atlantic the population

00:24:02.129 --> 00:24:02.139
in the North Atlantic the population
 

00:24:02.139 --> 00:24:03.539
in the North Atlantic the population
will continue to grow and they'll be

will continue to grow and they'll be
 

00:24:03.549 --> 00:24:05.729
will continue to grow and they'll be
okay but right now they're on a downward

00:24:05.729 --> 00:24:05.739
okay but right now they're on a downward
 

00:24:05.739 --> 00:24:08.459
okay but right now they're on a downward
spiral and to contrast the the

spiral and to contrast the the
 

00:24:08.469 --> 00:24:10.259

beleaguered North Atlantic right well I

00:24:10.259 --> 00:24:10.269
beleaguered North Atlantic right well I
 

00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:11.940
beleaguered North Atlantic right well I
wanted to show a population of southern

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:11.950
wanted to show a population of southern

right whales that were doing much better

00:24:13.379 --> 00:24:13.389
right whales that were doing much better
 

00:24:13.389 --> 00:24:16.039
right whales that were doing much better
because they live much further away from

00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:16.049
because they live much further away from
 

00:24:16.049 --> 00:24:18.329

here so I went to a population in New

00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:20.559
here so I went to a population in New

was a bit of a speculative trip we

00:24:26.999 --> 00:24:27.009
was a bit of a speculative trip we
 

00:24:27.009 --> 00:24:28.259
was a bit of a speculative trip we
didn't know what we would find they

00:24:28.259 --> 00:24:28.269
didn't know what we would find they
 

00:24:28.269 --> 00:24:29.519

so I went down there for three weeks on

00:24:31.619 --> 00:24:31.629
so I went down there for three weeks on
 

00:24:31.629 --> 00:24:34.169
so I went down there for three weeks on
a sailboat in wintertime as I said in

00:24:34.169 --> 00:24:34.179
a sailboat in wintertime as I said in
 

00:24:34.179 --> 00:24:35.399
a sailboat in wintertime as I said in
the sub-antarctic so the weather was

00:24:35.399 --> 00:24:35.409
the sub-antarctic so the weather was
 

00:24:35.409 --> 00:24:37.440
the sub-antarctic so the weather was
tough but I got in the water and was

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:37.450
tough but I got in the water and was
 

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:39.419
tough but I got in the water and was
just amazed at what I saw there were

00:24:39.419 --> 00:24:39.429

these beautiful whales that were highly
 

00:24:41.229 --> 00:24:43.799
these beautiful whales that were highly
curious and just wanted to to come close

00:24:43.799 --> 00:24:43.809
curious and just wanted to to come close
 

00:24:43.809 --> 00:24:47.009
curious and just wanted to to come close
and see me I was reluctant to have

00:24:47.009 --> 00:24:47.019
and see me I was reluctant to have
 

00:24:47.019 --> 00:24:48.299
and see me I was reluctant to have
anybody else get in the water with me

00:24:48.299 --> 00:24:48.309
anybody else get in the water with me
 

00:24:48.309 --> 00:24:49.259
anybody else get in the water with me
initially because I thought these

00:24:49.259 --> 00:24:49.269
initially because I thought these
 

00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:51.450
initially because I thought these
animals might be spooked by me so I

00:24:51.450 --> 00:24:51.460
animals might be spooked by me so I
 

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:53.849

point photographing it as I moved and
 

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.039
point photographing it as I moved and
finally you know you just can't keep up

00:26:05.039 --> 00:26:05.049
finally you know you just can't keep up
 

00:26:05.049 --> 00:26:06.810
finally you know you just can't keep up
anymore so I knelt down on the bottom to

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:06.820
anymore so I knelt down on the bottom to
 

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:08.430
anymore so I knelt down on the bottom to
catch my breath and thinking the wheel

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:08.440
catch my breath and thinking the wheel
 

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.389
catch my breath and thinking the wheel
would just keep going and the wheel

00:26:09.389 --> 00:26:09.399
would just keep going and the wheel
 

00:26:09.399 --> 00:26:11.789
would just keep going and the wheel
stopped it turned and came back and just

00:26:11.789 --> 00:26:11.799
stopped it turned and came back and just
 

00:26:11.799 --> 00:26:13.409
stopped it turned and came back and just
looked at me with that big eye and sort

00:26:13.409 --> 00:26:13.419
looked at me with that big eye and sort
 

00:26:13.419 --> 00:26:14.909
looked at me with that big eye and sort
of was waiting for me to catch my breath

of was waiting for me to catch my breath
 

00:26:14.919 --> 00:26:17.969
of was waiting for me to catch my breath
and go so um it's extraordinary when you

00:26:17.969 --> 00:26:17.979
and go so um it's extraordinary when you
 

00:26:17.979 --> 00:26:19.619
and go so um it's extraordinary when you
can have those kinds of encounters a

but you know you're still expecting to
 

00:28:04.749 --> 00:28:06.690
but you know you're still expecting to
see lots of fish you expecting to see

were all hiding they were tucked down in
 

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.690
were all hiding they were tucked down in
the reef so it was difficult to

estimate that this one coral head is
 

00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:48.389
estimate that this one coral head is
about 500 years old so it's amazing to

00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399
about 500 years old so it's amazing to
 

00:28:48.399 --> 00:28:50.489
about 500 years old so it's amazing to
still find pristine places like that on
