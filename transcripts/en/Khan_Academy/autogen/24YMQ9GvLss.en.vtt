00:00:00.122 --> 00:00:02.026
 Let's review or summarize 

00:00:02.026 --> 00:00:04.649
 everything we have learned about the plant 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:07.854
 and animal cells. This to the left 

00:00:07.854 --> 00:00:12.057
 is a drawing of an animal cage. 

00:00:12.057 --> 00:00:13.786
 Animal cell. 

00:00:13.786 --> 00:00:16.155
 And the one on the right is a drawing 

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:18.117
 of a plant cell. 

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:19.708
 Plant cell. 

00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:21.356
 Let's start with 

00:00:21.356 --> 00:00:22.819
 the outer part of the cage. 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.489
 Both cell types have an extracellular matrix. 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.415
 On the outside of the animal cage 

00:00:28.415 --> 00:00:31.515
 you see all these collagen fibers and so on, 

00:00:31.515 --> 00:00:33.883
 all these fibers hold the cell stable 

00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:35.857
 allow cells to connect. 

00:00:35.857 --> 00:00:38.086
 Depending on the exact composition of the extracellular matrix, 

00:00:38.086 --> 00:00:40.455
 may also help in the transmission of signals between cells. 

00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:43.856
 This is the extracellular matrix. 

00:00:43.856 --> 00:00:45.818
 But when we talk about the extracellular matrix of 

00:00:45.818 --> 00:00:47.850
 plant cell, we should also think about 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.184
 some other components that 

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:51.960
 are part of the cell wall itself. 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.027
 The cell wall is the main difference 

00:00:54.027 --> 00:00:55.791
 between plant and animal cells. 

00:00:55.791 --> 00:01:00.853
 The cell wall occurs in plant cells. 

00:01:00.853 --> 00:01:03.860
 Animal cells have no cell walls. 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.517
 If we go down one layer deeper, get to the plasma 

00:01:07.517 --> 00:01:09.027
 membrane or cell membrane will 

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:10.815
 we see that it is present in both cell types. 

00:01:10.815 --> 00:01:14.356
 The animal cell will have a cell membrane, 

00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:19.220
 the plant cell will also have a cell membrane. 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.925
 Both animals and plants can be seen 

00:01:21.925 --> 00:01:23.911
 tunnels between adjacent cells, 

00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:26.523
 the boundaries between two cells. 

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:29.251
 We studied them in the video about the cell wall of the plant cells. 

00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:33.419
 We have seen that these things here are called plasmodeisms. 

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:35.753
 We can see a whole plasmode here, 

00:01:35.753 --> 00:01:38.319
 where I started painting a part of the neighboring cage. 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.611
 Plasmodems. 

00:01:45.071 --> 00:01:48.524
 In animal cells analogous to plasmodezes are the socket contacts, 

00:01:48.524 --> 00:01:51.624
 which are also tunnels between adjacent cells. 

00:01:51.624 --> 00:01:54.758
 Clenched contacts. 

00:01:54.758 --> 00:01:57.440
 Plasmodeisms are much more common in 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.995
 different types of plants, compared to the slices of the animals. 

00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:02.758
 Crowded contacts are common only in certain species 

00:02:02.758 --> 00:02:04.395
 animal cells. 

00:02:04.395 --> 00:02:07.286
 For example, adjacent cardiac muscle cells have socket contacts 

00:02:07.286 --> 00:02:08.551
 with each other, 

00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:11.488
 to allow the transmission of electrical signals through the heart tissue. 

00:02:11.488 --> 00:02:14.472
 So the neighboring cells understand that they have to be shortened 

00:02:14.472 --> 00:02:16.887
 in the right way. This is extremely important for 

00:02:16.887 --> 00:02:19.859
 certain types of animal cells. 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.123
 Now, let's go one more deeper layer. 

00:02:22.123 --> 00:02:24.689
 But before that I want to say something again, 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.419
 which I emphasize in almost every video. 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:28.857
 All of these membranes we paint, 

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:30.587
 whether they are external cell membranes 

00:02:30.587 --> 00:02:32.317
 or membrane organelles, 

00:02:32.317 --> 00:02:36.218
 are double lipid layers, double phospholipid layers. 

00:02:36.218 --> 00:02:39.178
 Let's increase this part here. 

00:02:39.178 --> 00:02:41.489
 The yellow part 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.718
 looks like a line, 

00:02:43.718 --> 00:02:46.562
 but in reality 

00:02:46.562 --> 00:02:49.128
 these are phospholipids, 

00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:51.090
 these are double layers of phospholipids, 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.724
 whose hydrophilic heads point outward, 

00:02:54.724 --> 00:02:58.288
 and their hydrophobic tails point inward. 

00:02:58.288 --> 00:03:00.192
 This double lipid layer extends along the entire membrane. Let it be clear. 

00:03:00.192 --> 00:03:02.526
 All these membranes I paint 

00:03:02.526 --> 00:03:04.755
 are double lipid layers. 

00:03:04.755 --> 00:03:06.717
 Let's continue. 

00:03:06.717 --> 00:03:08.656
 Once we enter the cell, 

00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:12.139
 we see that both types of cells have a cytoskeleton. 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:15.274
 We have cytoskeletons, therefore 

00:03:15.274 --> 00:03:17.294
 here are microfilaments, 

00:03:17.294 --> 00:03:19.418
 mycophilimate. 

00:03:19.418 --> 00:03:21.450
 The drawing does not show their complex structure, 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.087
 because we want to have a relatively simple one 

00:03:23.087 --> 00:03:24.747
 cell diagram. 

00:03:24.747 --> 00:03:27.023
 We have microtubules, 

00:03:27.023 --> 00:03:28.625
 microtubules. 

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.121
 There may also be intermedia filaments. 

00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:34.256
 We talk about all these structures in another video. 

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:37.356
 Now, let's pay more attention to other organelles. 

00:03:37.356 --> 00:03:40.827
 Animal centers have centrosomes. 

00:03:40.827 --> 00:03:44.426
 They are key to organizing microtubules. 

00:03:44.426 --> 00:03:47.027
 We will talk a lot about centrosomes when dealing with mitosis. 

00:03:47.027 --> 00:03:48.652
 We do not see centrosomes in plant cells. 

00:03:48.652 --> 00:03:51.590
 Plant cells use other ways of organizing 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.225
 of their microtubules, 

00:03:54.225 --> 00:03:56.756
 especially during 

00:03:56.756 --> 00:04:00.018
 mitosis. But let's see what other differences exist between the plant and the animal cage. 

00:04:00.018 --> 00:04:02.213
 A big difference you can notice 

00:04:02.213 --> 00:04:07.391
 is this big, blue balloon, like an egg. 

00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:09.086
 These green things are not in it, 

00:04:09.086 --> 00:04:11.350
 just the blue bubble is behind the green stuff. 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.159
 Structures like this are associated with the plant, and with 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.506
 animal cells. 

00:04:15.506 --> 00:04:17.759
 This blue balloon is a central vacuum. 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.951
 Central Vacuol. 

00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:23.552
 The central vacuum can store liquids 

00:04:23.552 --> 00:04:27.360
 or enzymes. It can also be considered as a waste disposal site. 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.158
 In fact, although vacuoles are often found in plant cells, 

00:04:30.158 --> 00:04:32.817
 they can have a variety of functions 

00:04:32.817 --> 00:04:34.117
 depending on the type of plant cells. 

00:04:34.117 --> 00:04:35.754
 I want you to pay attention to this, 

00:04:35.754 --> 00:04:37.495
 we will talk about it and other videos. 

00:04:37.495 --> 00:04:39.446
 We see all these organelles, 

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:41.722
 we make drawings, put them on charts 

00:04:41.722 --> 00:04:44.055
 and we think we know what most of their functions are. 

00:04:44.055 --> 00:04:47.689
 But in fact, organelles 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:50.951
 cells as a whole are still subject to active scientific research. 

00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:53.680
 In the coming decades we will find 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.154
 many more features that these organelles can perform, 

00:04:55.154 --> 00:04:57.325
 ways they can send signals and communicate, 

00:04:57.325 --> 00:04:59.891
 what is their behavior under different conditions, 

00:04:59.891 --> 00:05:03.084
 so we begin to understand 

00:05:03.084 --> 00:05:04.721
 better what they do. 

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.695
 But in the coming decades we will learn more 

00:05:06.695 --> 00:05:09.957
 much, much more about the different structures and functions 

00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:11.188
 of the cage. 

00:05:11.188 --> 00:05:12.720
 As I already mentioned, this is the central vacuum. 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.588
 It is large and can provide structural support 

00:05:15.588 --> 00:05:17.817
 of the cage, can store things, 

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.849
 some animal cells 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:22.519
 may also have vacuole, 

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:27.349
 but not all. The best analogue of vacuole in animal cells is lysozyme. 

00:05:27.349 --> 00:05:30.089
 It is here here in orange. 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:32.759
 This is a lysozyme here. 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:34.559
 Lysozyme, 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:35.661
 lysozyme. 

00:05:35.661 --> 00:05:38.761
 Lysozyme can be considered as a waste disposal site 

00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:41.826
 in the animal cage. 

00:05:41.826 --> 00:05:45.820
 Lysosomes contain enzymes, so when something comes in, 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.993
 it breaks down. 

00:05:46.993 --> 00:05:50.220
 The interior of the lysosomes has a relatively low pH, 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:53.657
 it is more acidic than it is, so that things that fall into them can be broken down 

00:05:53.657 --> 00:05:57.059
 and their components to be recycled. 

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:59.857
 Because we are in the category of places in which 

00:05:59.857 --> 00:06:03.224
 are degraded, catabolized 

00:06:03.224 --> 00:06:04.988
 or metabolize different things, 

00:06:04.988 --> 00:06:08.605
 we can talk about peroxisomes too. 

00:06:08.605 --> 00:06:11.533
 Peroxisomes. 

00:06:13.923 --> 00:06:15.484
 Here we can see two of them, 

00:06:15.484 --> 00:06:17.713
 they call it that because when they were found for 

00:06:17.713 --> 00:06:19.361
 the first time, the scientists said, "Hey, there's something going on here, 

00:06:19.361 --> 00:06:22.217
 oxidation reactions occur. " 

00:06:22.217 --> 00:06:25.352
 "The final by-product appears to be hydrogen 

00:06:25.352 --> 00:06:28.557
 peroxide. "They were called peroxisomes. 

00:06:28.557 --> 00:06:30.658
 We still study all the functions these organelles perform, 

00:06:30.658 --> 00:06:34.919
 but we know they are important to 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:36.927
 breaking down long chains of fatty acids, 

00:06:36.927 --> 00:06:40.956
 to make them easier to use than other parts of the cage. 

00:06:40.956 --> 00:06:42.918
 Peroxisomes have other roles, 

00:06:42.918 --> 00:06:47.817
 whose mechanisms are not yet fully studied. 

00:06:47.817 --> 00:06:50.290
 Now let's get back to the differences between herbs and herbs 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:53.518
 animal cells. Key difference is 

00:06:53.518 --> 00:06:55.387
 these organelles here. 

00:06:55.387 --> 00:06:56.595
 These are chloroplasts. 

00:06:56.595 --> 00:06:58.220
 Photosynthesis takes place there 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.554
 and of course, they occur in plant cells. 

00:07:00.554 --> 00:07:02.156
 Thanks to these organelles the plants 

00:07:02.156 --> 00:07:06.161
 they create food. 

00:07:06.161 --> 00:07:08.878
 We can say that they fix carbon with the help of light energy. 

00:07:08.878 --> 00:07:11.119
 Chloroplast. 

00:07:11.119 --> 00:07:14.219
 We have chloroplast here. 

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:16.726
 Chloroplasts are not found in animal cells. 

00:07:16.726 --> 00:07:18.294
 When we talk about energy, 

00:07:18.294 --> 00:07:20.418
 we are talking about factories producing ATP in cells, 

00:07:20.418 --> 00:07:21.983
 they occur in both cell types. 

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:24.493
 This of course is the mitochondria. 

00:07:24.493 --> 00:07:27.791
 We see mitochondria in both cell types. 

00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:29.323
 There are other organelles found in plant, 

00:07:29.323 --> 00:07:29.985
 and in animal cells. 

00:07:29.985 --> 00:07:31.726
 We see 

00:07:31.726 --> 00:07:34.025
 Goldie apparatus in this cell 

00:07:34.025 --> 00:07:35.720
 and in this. 

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.122
 This is where the proteins are packaged for use 

00:07:39.122 --> 00:07:41.653
 in the cage itself or out of it. 

00:07:41.653 --> 00:07:44.114
 We have an endoplasmic network. 

00:07:44.114 --> 00:07:45.728
 We have a grainy endoplasmic mesh, 

00:07:45.728 --> 00:07:48.155
 which has ribosomes associated with the membrane, 

00:07:48.155 --> 00:07:50.418
 we also have a smooth endoplasmic mesh that has no ribosomes. 

00:07:50.418 --> 00:07:52.857
 This is where many proteins are produced, 

00:07:52.857 --> 00:07:54.192
 as well 

00:07:54.192 --> 00:07:56.560
 lipids. 

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.453
 Then we have the nuclear shell. 

00:07:58.453 --> 00:08:00.357
 In fact, this is the internal nuclear membrane 

00:08:00.357 --> 00:08:01.251
 right here. 

00:08:01.251 --> 00:08:03.259
 The outer membrane is connected 

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:04.989
 with the endoplasmic grid. 

00:08:04.989 --> 00:08:06.986
 You can see these structures in both cell types. 

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:08.623
 In the nuclear shell, of course, there is DNA. 

00:08:08.623 --> 00:08:11.583
 It is in the form of a chromatin. We also have 

00:08:11.583 --> 00:08:14.416
 this very dense area, which is visible on a microscope. 

00:08:14.416 --> 00:08:17.156
 It is called coyote and associates 

00:08:17.156 --> 00:08:19.258
 p 

00:08:19.258 --> 00:08:22.555
 robozomic forms and ribosomal RNA. 

00:08:22.555 --> 00:08:25.121
 Naturally we have all these free ribosomes. 

00:08:25.121 --> 00:08:28.395
 We have free ribosomes. 

00:08:28.395 --> 00:08:32.818
 I would say that this is a very quick review of 

00:08:32.818 --> 00:08:34.594
 eukaryotic cells, 

00:08:34.594 --> 00:08:36.824
 but I hope you gave it an idea 

00:08:36.824 --> 00:08:40.673
 for some of the major differences between plant and animal cells.
