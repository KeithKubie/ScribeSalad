00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.319
[cheers and applause]

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.188
(Cristela)
So I'm in my 30s,

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:57.491
and I've only had one boyfriend
in my life.

00:00:57.524 --> 00:01:01.261
And I think it's weird too,
because I'm obviously so pretty.

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:02.629
But...

00:01:02.663 --> 00:01:04.064
(woman)
Whoo-whoo!

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:05.299
Thanks.
That's my mom.

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:06.767
[laughter]

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.302
??

00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:12.139
Oh, no, no.

00:01:12.172 --> 00:01:15.642
I also have to tell you that
I have a thing for Jewish guys.

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:20.080
I love Jewish guys.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:23.650
Like, you know how guys get
excited when they see, like...

00:01:23.684 --> 00:01:25.219
[laughter]

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:26.587
Hey.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.722
[laughs]

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:31.825
[cheers and applause]

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:33.594
Where did you get
that Spanish from?

00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:35.662
It's because I grew up
in South Texas,

00:01:35.696 --> 00:01:37.364
and I grew up
with Mexicans,

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.466
so then when I moved
to New York,

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.735
I thought Jewish guys
were so exotic

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:44.571
that I was like,
"Oh, my God."

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:47.841
I, like, yeah!

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:49.776
[laughter and applause]

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.280
So I was doing an open mic,
and I met this guy,

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:55.182
and he was a stand-up comic too.

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:56.717
He still is.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.453
And we started talking,
and he was really nerdy,

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.722
like, pale, black glasses,
you know,

00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:04.258
and I was like,
"Yes, this guy," and...

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:06.093
30 minutes into
the conversation,

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:09.096
he tells me he's Jewish,
and in my, like, I'm like,

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.731
"Oh, that's cool,"
but in my mind, I'm like...

00:02:10.764 --> 00:02:12.766
[imitates alarm blaring]

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.635
Like, love it, right?

00:02:14.668 --> 00:02:17.304
I'm like,
"Oh, I'm on board, right?"

00:02:17.337 --> 00:02:18.705
It was a Jewish guy in Dallas.

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.674
It was like a unicorn,
and...

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:23.777
[laughter]

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.779
We ended up going out on a date,

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:30.083
and he tells on the date
that he is a part-time cop.

00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:33.187
And I have a fear of cops,

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.257
because they tend to be
not nice to me in my life,

00:02:37.291 --> 00:02:39.092
so we went out
on our first date,

00:02:39.126 --> 00:02:40.294
and we ended up hitting it off.

00:02:40.327 --> 00:02:42.262
We started dating.

00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:44.298
We're, like, maybe a month
into dating, right?

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:45.666
And we decide
that we're gonna have

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:47.367
a romantic trip to New York.

00:02:47.401 --> 00:02:49.336
We're gonna go on Thanksgiving,
right?

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:51.805
And we're so excited,
and I'm, like, loving it,

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:54.308
and the moment we started
planning the trip,

00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:56.343
he becomes Clark Griswold
from <i>National Lampoon.</i>

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.478
It's, like,
he gets really anal.

00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:00.347
He's like, "All right,
we're gonna go traveling."

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.249
That's my Jewish accent.

00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:04.151
And he's like,
"We're gonna go traveling,

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.253
"and we need to make it easy
for security,

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:09.256
"so don't wear any belts
to set off the metal detector.

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.258
"Don't put on any shoes
with laces.

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.360
"Like, save time,
liquids, gels, 3 ounces,

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:15.229
blah, blah, blah,"
you know.

00:03:15.262 --> 00:03:16.663
I'm like,
"Yeah, I've flown before."

00:03:16.697 --> 00:03:18.131
Thank you.

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:20.601
So then we go,
and we get in line

00:03:20.634 --> 00:03:22.636
at the security line,
right?

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.072
And this guy, he's just like,
"Hey, remember, man, like,

00:03:25.105 --> 00:03:26.773
if you're wearing a belt,
take off your"--

00:03:26.807 --> 00:03:28.175
I'm like, "I get this, okay?

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:30.077
I'm not wearing a belt.
Good."

00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:31.445
We get in the security line.

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:32.813
I go through.

00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:34.715
No problem, right?

00:03:34.748 --> 00:03:39.086
He gets in the other line,
and he walks through,

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:40.787
and then all of a sudden,
it's like...

00:03:40.821 --> 00:03:42.189
[makes squeaking noise]

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.324
His bag, right?

00:03:44.358 --> 00:03:45.826
So they're like,
"Whoa, whoa

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.394
There's something with the bag.

00:03:47.427 --> 00:03:49.363
We've got to look inside
the bag," right?

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:51.198
Looks inside the bag.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:54.234
This old white guy
who works at TSA is like,

00:03:54.268 --> 00:03:57.704
"Whoa, we've got to
shut security down."

00:03:57.738 --> 00:03:59.573
Shuts security down.

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:03.443
They sent 200 people away
to another security gate.

00:04:03.477 --> 00:04:05.512
We don't know why,
right?

00:04:05.546 --> 00:04:11.051
This guy, the old white guy,
starts swabbing the bag, right?

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:15.222
And it comes back positive
for explosives.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.357
Then I hear
the old white guy say,

00:04:17.391 --> 00:04:19.226
"Whoa, Nelly."

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.528
[laughter]

00:04:21.562 --> 00:04:24.264
The guy looks at the bottom
of the bag

00:04:24.298 --> 00:04:28.068
and takes out
a .40-caliber Glock.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:30.304
[laughter]

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:35.309
I start thinking,
"Oh, my God.

00:04:35.342 --> 00:04:38.745
This is not [bleep]ing
happening.

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:42.082
[laughter and applause]

00:04:42.082 --> 00:04:44.418
They get the gun.

00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:46.753
They put me against the wall.

00:04:46.787 --> 00:04:49.089
They pad me down.

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:50.357
Mind you, my white boyfriend

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.160
isn't getting any
of this shit.

00:04:53.193 --> 00:04:54.528
They're like,
"Oh, you brought the gun?

00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:56.163
Brown girl,
come here."

00:04:56.196 --> 00:04:58.298
It's like,
"Oh, all right."

00:04:58.332 --> 00:05:01.034
This is weird,
all right."

00:05:01.034 --> 00:05:03.504
So after that, they have to call
the police department

00:05:03.537 --> 00:05:06.440
that he was a cop to make sure
he wasn't lying.

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.408
They verify,
"Hey, he's a real cop," right?

00:05:08.442 --> 00:05:10.177
They let us go.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.045
I go to the plane, and I think,
"[bleep] this guy,

00:05:12.079 --> 00:05:13.547
"if I never see him again.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.183
I'm going to New York
by myself," right.

00:05:16.216 --> 00:05:18.485
He sits next to me,
and the entire time,

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:20.053
we're just sitting like this.

00:05:20.087 --> 00:05:22.055
I'm looking outside the window.

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:24.057
He looks like this.
He's looking at me.

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:26.093
An hour into the flight,

00:05:26.126 --> 00:05:29.763
I finally look at him and say,

00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:33.200
"Well, at least the [bleep]ing
belt didn't set off

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:36.537
the [bleep]ing metal detector."

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.637
Thank you.
