00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.700
We live in a dynamic world that’s always
moving.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.120
Nothing would get done if everything stayed
still.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.820
It’s this very movement that gives us life,
that allows the blood to flow through our
veins and gives action to our stories.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.780
But what does this mean to us as engineers?

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.160
What’s really happening when things move?

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.940
Well, since pretty much everything has mass,
most of the movement in our world is associated
with mass transfer.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.520
It’s critical to our work, our lives, and
something that we should learn more about.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:38.580
[Theme Music]

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.040
We’ve talked a good deal about transfer
so far.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.280
Whether it was momentum transfer,
as we saw with moving fluids,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.160
or heat transfer, like stepping out in the sun
or touching a hot pan, we’ve seen how things
move and change.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.500
But when people think of mass transfer, they often
think of something pretty simple – the movement of
an object, or fluid’s mass, from one place to another.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.220
But that’s not really what it is.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.940
That’s more like bulk fluid movement, which
we learned about in fluid mechanics.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.540
No, what we mean by mass transfer is a bit
more complicated.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.060
Mass transfer is the movement of
individual molecules and components
within a larger mixture or substance.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.180
So it deals with what makes up something
like a stream of water rather than its bulk
movement as a whole.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:25.380
Now, because mass transfer works on this often
microscopic scale, it has a lot to do with chemical
separation and can literally be crucial to life itself.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.720
To see what I mean, think of drug delivery.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.400
And no, I don’t mean like driving around
a delivery truck of pharmaceuticals.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.620
I’m talking about medicine moving within
the body itself.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.920
Medical treatment depends on medicine getting
to the right place in your body.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.859
It often needs to go through your mouth, to
your stomach, and then into your bloodstream.

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:44.770
Or maybe it needs to be injected into a certain
location.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.360
But a drug might be less effective if it’s
not taken correctly.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.320
Sometimes it won't even work at all.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.840
For instance, people with Type 1 and often
Type 2 diabetes have to take insulin by injection,
in places like their arms or their stomachs.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.760
Just swallowing insulin, in pill or liquid form,
wouldn’t work, because it would break down in the
patient’s stomach acid before it could do its job.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.720
But let’s assume a certain medicine is taken
correctly.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.480
Then its individual molecules and medical
compounds have to move through the fluids
in your body to the right location.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.480
There’s a lot more to consider than just
that, but at its core, drug delivery is all
about mass transfer.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.040
It’s about how one type of chemical moves
through other chemicals to get where it needs
to go in a mixture.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.860
So how does that mass get transferred?

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.000
Well, it needs a driving force.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.560
We learned that for momentum transfer, the
driving force was a difference in velocity.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.349
For heat transfer, it was a difference in
temperature.

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.480
For mass transfer, the driving force is a
little more complex.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.240
Let’s think back to thermodynamics.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.320
We said that everything was always trying
to reach thermal equilibrium, or a balance
of temperatures.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.280
That’s why temperature differences drive
heat transfer.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.380
For mass transfer, we’re still trying to
reach an equilibrium, but this time it’s
a chemical equilibrium.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:03:02.360
Chemical equilibrium can be explained in terms like
chemical potential and fugacity, but those are pretty
abstract concepts and difficult to directly measure.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.480
Which, we as engineers, need to do.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.480
So for our purposes, a better way to explain
chemical equilibrium is to approximate it
in terms of concentration.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.000
Simply put, concentration is how much there
is of something in a certain amount of space,
or volume.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.400
Here, we’ll look at concentration related
to mass, so it will be mass per volume.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.980
So for something to reach chemical equilibrium,
it’s going to need to have the same concentration
throughout.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.800
That means that, when left alone, and not
acted upon by another force,

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:35.300
particles won’t move from one location to
another within a fluid or a substance if there isn’t
a concentration difference within it.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.780
No concentration difference, no mass transfer.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.280
If there is a difference, then the concentration will
move from the higher concentration to the lower one.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.900
But concentration isn’t just something we need
to worry about for a substance or fluid on its own,
but also when it mixes with something else.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.760
To keep things simple, let’s just talk about
fluids for now.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.720
Let’s also assume that the fluids are fully
miscible, which means that they can be
completely mixed together.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.200
So, when one fluid is put into the other one,
we can view the combined fluids as a single
mixture in terms of mass transfer.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.620
That means that the fluids will mix together
until the solution has the same concentration
throughout it.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.280
Well, how do they do that?

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.240
One major way is through diffusion.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.180
Diffusion is when the molecules of two or
more things intermingle as they move from
higher concentrations to lower ones.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.440
To see what I mean, let’s use an example
that you can do at home!

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.560
If you take a drop of red food coloring and
mix it in with a glass of water,

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.900
you’ll notice that the red color slowly
spreads throughout the glass until the
solution is the same color.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.140
That’s diffusion!

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.600
And the more food coloring you add, the darker
and redder the solution will be.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.440
No matter how much you add, it will eventually
diffuse into one uniform color, given enough time.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.800
And how fast something diffuses can be very
important as well.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.460
This especially comes into play when thinking
about safety.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.660
For example, you’ll want to know how fast
certain acidic or corrosive chemicals can
move through your protective rubber gloves.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.440
Or how fast chemicals can enter your body
when you’re exposed to them.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.220
Or how quickly they can diffuse through
your skin or organs to reach vulnerable parts
of your body.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.240
That’s why whenever you work with hazardous
chemicals, you protect yourself so that the rate
of diffusion is as low as it can be.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.120
What if you’re trying to produce a chemical
for sale – or maybe just convert a toxic
chemical into something safer –

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.200
so you pass the raw material through a
catalytic converter.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.560
Reactions will certainly occur on the surfaces
of all the catalytic particles inside,

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.860
but how fast the molecules diffuse to the catalyst
surfaces will affect how much product you get,
and how fast the reaction will even occur!

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.690
Now, if we really want to be able to understand
and quantify mass transfer, then we’re going to
need to learn about Fick’s Law.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.780
Fick’s Law states that there’s a drift,
or movement, of particles from denser
regions to ones that are less dense,

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.800
or that they’re moving from a high
concentration to a lower one.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.480
So, pretty much what we just learned.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.080
Fick’s Law defines the rate of this drift
– the diffusion, or mass flux in our case,

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:55.300
as proportional to the product of the
thermophysical property – which is the diffusivity
constant or coefficient –

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.740
and the driving force – which
will be our concentration gradient.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.940
The negative sign here shows us that the
diffusion will occur in the direction opposite
that of the increasing concentration,

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.630
or from a higher concentration to a lesser one.

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:13.520
Now, D will either be called the diffusion
constant or diffusion coefficient, depending
on who you ask.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.430
But in all practicality, they mean the same
thing.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.180
That’s a debate more of semantics than application.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.920
And the concentration gradient you’ll see
here is the derivative of our concentration
in the x direction.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.480
If you're not familiar with derivatives, they’re
basically rates of change.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:34.160
What’s important to remember is that, while
we’ve been focusing on the mass transfer of
particles themselves moving,

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.800
this movement is going to be making the
overall mass of whatever the particles are in
move as well.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.440
So this small movement can lead to bigger,
bulk movement.

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:49.940
The tiny particles won’t be able to get their overall
mass to move in certain obstructed directions, like
getting water to move through the glass that it’s in,

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:55.540
but they can cause bulk motion into more
open directions, like the air above the water.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.620
In the end, when things are moving, there’s
a lot more going on than just mass transfer.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.020
But it does give us the basis to understand
some of what’s going on.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.500
Just because particles are small, don’t
count them out.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.860
Get enough of them moving, and you can make
a big change.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.360
Now that I’ve said that out loud, that actually
sounds pretty inspirational.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.740
So in today’s lesson, we learned all about
mass transfer.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:22.640
We found out that it doesn’t just apply to objects
and fluids as a whole, but also to the individual
molecules and components that make them up.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:28.020
Then we saw that transfers of mass need their
own driving force, which we found to be concentration,

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.200
as things try to reach a state of chemical
equilibrium.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.960
Diffusion was a way to get to this balanced
state, and we were able to use Fick’s Law
to help us model mass transfer.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:43.280
I’ll see you next time, when we’ll talk
about separation and apply what we just learned
to mass transfer equipment.
