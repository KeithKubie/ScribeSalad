00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:02.568
I'm auditioning
for the Law Faculty Comedy

00:00:02.568 --> 00:00:04.337
Show in, like, 10 minutes.
The what?

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:06.506
The Law Faculty Comedy Show.

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:08.374
It's an annual comedy
sketch show

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:09.876
written and performed
by law students.

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:11.811
Hey, you should
audition with me.

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:14.113
Uh, join a bunch of
self-indulgent, self-centered,

00:00:14.113 --> 00:00:16.015
self-absorbed,
Type A personality law students

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:17.784
who think they're
God's gift to comedy?

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.419
No, thank you.
Come on, it will be fun.

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.088
We'll get to hang out.
Uh, let me think about it.

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.257
[spitting]

00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:26.992
Well, I'm going.
If you change your mind,

00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:28.327
auditions are on
the third floor.

00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:30.729
OK, thank you. Oh my god!
[splashing]

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.098
- No, no, no no--
- Oh, I'm sorry.

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:33.466
No, it's fine.
No no, it's fine. Go, go.

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:35.034
I don't like these pants,
anyway. Just go.

00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:39.339
Don't be late. See you later.
Will you guys just bang already?

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:43.009
We're just friends, man.
Yeah? Friends can bang.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:46.179
Listen, I know to your
primitive, impulse-driven minds,

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:49.315
the concept of a platonic
relationship between a man

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:51.951
and a woman is completely
incomprehensible.

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.452
You might be friends now,

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:56.389
but you are one heartbeat away
from looking at her differently.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:58.091
And then, everything changes.

00:01:04.297 --> 00:01:15.675
[romantic music playing]

00:01:16.842 --> 00:01:18.378
What?
No, that's crazy talk.

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.546
It's going to happen.
Yeah.

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:22.982
It's a good thing you're not
doing that comedy whatever show.

00:01:22.982 --> 00:01:25.018
Spending weeks
together performing,

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:26.686
all those raw emotions,

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:29.855
sweat and tears,
physical contact--

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:32.325
are you kidding me?
Interesting.

00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:36.395
I've got to go for class.
There's no more classes today.

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:38.798
It's an extra class.
There are no more classes today!

00:01:38.798 --> 00:01:40.934
You are lying!
You go, Ronny Chieng!

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.836
Go make a half-White,
half-Asian baby!

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.172
You know, halfies
are super cute.

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:48.975
[drums playing]
[guttural noises]

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:54.280
Loud, loud.
[guttural sounds]

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:06.059
Loud loud.

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:07.526
[romantic music playing]

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:08.861
Hey, you came.

00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:10.896
Hey.
What made you change your mind?

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:13.600
You know, meet new people,
get out of my comfort zone.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:19.138
[shouting]
[guttural sounds]

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:22.975
Oh, no. Please tell me
he's not auditioning.

00:02:23.742 --> 00:02:27.547
Good morning, everyone.
Ronny. Come gather round.

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:31.384
My name is Daniel
Tremblay Burchall.

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:33.419
And I am honored
to have been chosen

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:37.356
as the youngest director
in the illustrious history

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:39.225
of the Law
Faculty Comedy Show.

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:41.794
[applause]
Shit.

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:44.330
Thank you.
Thank you.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.899
Let's warm up with a quick game
of Zip, Zap, Zoom.

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:50.003
So circle up. Yes!
Love Zip, Zap, Zoom.

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:53.039
- Zip.
- Zap.

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:57.443
- Zoom.
- Zip. Um, zap. Zip. Shit! Shit!

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:00.213
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:03:00.213 --> 00:03:01.847
I know it was zoom.
I know it was zoom.

00:03:01.847 --> 00:03:04.183
I-- of course it was zoom!
It's just a warm up.

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:08.421
OK, moving on.
When I point to you,

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:10.623
give me your name
and your best impersonation.

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:12.825
I'm sorry, I'm just
going to need a moment.

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:15.862
OK. You take as long
as you need. OK, go.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.997
- Uh, I'm Henry--
- I've got one! I've got one!

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:25.338
I've got one! I'm on. I'm on.
I'm on. OK. Do it! Just do it!

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:31.544
Don't let your dreams be dreams.
Yesterday, you said tomorrow.

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:33.812
So just do it!
Make your dreams come true

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.254
Do it! What are you waiting for?
Do it! Just do it!

00:03:41.254 --> 00:03:49.429
Yes, you can!
Just do it! Just do it!

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:58.805
What was that?
Shia LaBeouf. Oh, OK.

00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:02.942
Next? Uh, hi. I'm Ronny.

00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:05.511
And I don't really
do impersonations.

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.015
[laughter]
That character is hilarious.

00:04:10.916 --> 00:04:13.218
Oh, right. I'm actually
not doing a character right now.

00:04:13.218 --> 00:04:14.920
I'm just talking.
[laughter]

00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:17.923
Ronny, I know
you're not doing a character.

00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:20.092
But that doesn't mean
that it can't be one.

00:04:20.092 --> 00:04:25.431
All right? Just do it!
[drums]

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:27.967
DANIEL BURCHALL:
OK, funny people,

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:29.736
Thank you so much
for coming.

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:33.272
Ah, Asher?
I just wanted to say,

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:34.974
that was one of the
best auditions I've seen.

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:37.744
And I wanted to let you
know in person, that you're in.

00:04:38.978 --> 00:04:44.017
Thank you so much! Chieng.
Hey, man.

00:04:44.017 --> 00:04:45.752
Listen, all right, I get it.
You don't want me

00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.586
to be a part of your thing,
blah, blah, blah, whatever.

00:04:47.586 --> 00:04:48.921
I don't want to be
a part of it anyway.

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:51.090
I'm offering you
a part in the show.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.658
Oh. OK.

00:04:52.658 --> 00:04:53.992
If you think that
I'm petty enough

00:04:53.992 --> 00:04:57.330
to let our previous animosity
get in the way of art,

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.266
you've seriously misjudged me.
So you in?

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:07.874
Yeah, OK, I guess. Yeah.
I can't believe we both got in!

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:11.978
Did I get in?
No.

00:05:16.415 --> 00:05:22.588
I didn't do it!

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:24.289
[drums playing]

00:05:24.823 --> 00:05:26.458
DANIEL: So remember
what your card was?

00:05:26.458 --> 00:05:30.129
Yeah. That your card?
No, it wasn't.

00:05:30.896 --> 00:05:33.098
OK, that-- that's--
that's a disappointment.

00:05:34.032 --> 00:05:36.302
Oh, Chieng!
Just the person I wanted to see.

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:37.636
I've got a character

00:05:37.636 --> 00:05:39.238
that I think
you're going to be perfect for.

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:41.541
It's a classic
outsider struggling

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.242
to fit
into a foreign situation.

00:05:44.444 --> 00:05:46.579
Is it the angry
Asian laundry man?

00:05:46.579 --> 00:05:48.848
Yeah, I wrote it
specifically for you.

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.582
Ah, OK.

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:53.485
"Hello, sir.
Is this the laundromat?"

00:05:53.485 --> 00:05:58.057
"Yes, this is the-- rondromat."
"Can I get this suit cleaned?"

00:06:00.292 --> 00:06:02.495
Then it just says, "say
something angry in Chinese."

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:04.563
Yeah. Can you do that?
[speaking chinese]

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:08.167
No, no, no, like,
much angrier.

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:11.304
You know, he is the angry
Asian laundry man, after all.

00:06:12.138 --> 00:06:13.672
James, can you come over here
and show Ronny

00:06:13.672 --> 00:06:19.579
how it might be done?
Sure OK.

00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:22.715
"Hello, sir.
Can I get this suit cleaned?"

00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:31.224
[speaking chinese angrily]
And, scene.
