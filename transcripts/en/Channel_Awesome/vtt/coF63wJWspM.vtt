00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.400
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it, so you don't have to.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.960
Bad kitty.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.900
We all know Bill Murray duped himself into Garfield 1, thinking one of the Coen Brothers wrote it,

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.340
but his contract included a sequel, and because audiences LOVE to see this man punished, he got one.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.400
Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties continues the Garfield movie tradition of having practically nothing to do with Garfield.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.440
He dances, has a ton of energy, tries to help those in need, and looks like a hairy hallucination from Pink Floyd's 'The Wall'.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.300
But he likes lasagna so...no difference?

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.320
Probably goes without saying that this film is just as bad as the first,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.400
but this is an analytical review series, so just saying "Bite me, you pluck of ginger pubic hair!" probably isn't gonna be enough.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.340
So let's take a look with greater detail, something the filmmakers obviously didn't do!

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.260
This is Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.060
So it only figures that the opening would be in crayon -- 
I just assumed the whole script was written in it.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.620
The film starts off with a surprising narration from Roscoe Lee Browne, the narrator of Babe.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:20.160
"Once upon a time in an English castle, there lived a pampered personage."

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.560
Oh, knock off the elegance and dignity bullshit. You're Garfield 2!

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.900
"Prince knew no other life than a life of luxury."

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.320
"Oh, did I mention that Prince was a cat?"

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.580
"Yes, I'm kind of a bad narrator.  Oh, did I also mention that it takes place in the year 3021?"

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.480
Director: You're Fired.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.440
"Oh, bother."

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.800
So, as you can quickly imagine, this cat named Prince looks exactly like Garfield,

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.380
and it's obviously taking influence from Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.780
...If that's so, why is your title satirizing A Tale of Two Cities?

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.460
In fact, why did the opening credits have fairy tales? None of these things are connected!

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.060
This has less to do with Garfield than...the rest of the movie has anything to do with Garfield!

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.240
We then see our main character, Garfield, who's...
pretty athletic for being so heavy...

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.140
You guys do know what a cat is, right?

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.640
...as he discovers his master, Jon, is going to propose to Liz the vet, who Garfield apparently doesn't like.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.360
"Whatever happened to Jon? My metalhead guy, my dude? You were so much cooler when you wore a mullet."

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.860
Ugh, now they're suggesting that Jon had a mullet.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.660
Did he?

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:38.160
But Liz interrupts his big question, because apparently she's been invited to go to England, to speak at the Royal Animal Conservancy.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.760
"Jane Goodall dropped out at the last minute because she's nursing a sick chimp, and they asked me!"

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.100
Ah, yes. Jane Goodall (left) Liz the vet. (right) I totally understand this choice!

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:56.480
That's like saying, "What? We can't get Rudy Giuliani to open the 9/11 museum? Well, bring in Paul Blart: Mall Cop. That's a fitting replacement!

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.060
We do da smart ting!"

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.440
"You moron."

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:07.040
Jon decides to follow Liz to England, where we see the owner of Prince has died, and so a stretched Stephen Colbert reads the will, saying who gets what.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.340
"I leave all my worldly possessions to my beloved kitty, Prince XII."

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.940
"I, Prince? The new lord of the castle?"

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.600
That's right -- legality be damned! Cats can now own property and titleship!

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.420
Come on, as if anyone would be stupid enough to give uncontrollable power to a dumb, orange narcissist with no experience whatsoever.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.020
Eh, even if they did, I imagine his inauguration would be about this big.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.020
"I pledge from this day forward to rule my kingdom with wisdom and valor."

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.940
In case you're wondering, that's Tim Curry
providing the voice of Prince.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.520
Which is a shame, because I REALLY think
his acceptance speech should be a little bit more
Tim Curry-esque!

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:50.320
[Prince, as Darkness from 'Legend'] "Even now, the evil seed of what you've done germinates within you."

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.260
"I require the solace of the shadows... and the dark of the night."

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.940
"Sunshine is my DESTROYER!"

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.460
"We are all animals."

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.880
[NC, as Tim Curry]: "Have a lovely day!"

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.400
But Prince's rule upsets the original owner's nephew, Dargis, played by Billy Connolly.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.340
Who was very clearly chosen because John Cleese wouldn't do it.

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.700
Don't get me wrong, I love Billy Connolly,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.080
but it's amazing how much they make him look, sound, and act exactly like John Cleese.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.540
"Since he is gone, the title of the Carlyle Estate falls to me."

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.760
"Hidden gold under a twenty foot pile of horse shit."

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.680
"Well, actually, it's quite common."

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.940
"No, I don't need to read this yet."

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.060
"I don't particularly care what it seems to you."

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.400
MANUEL!!

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.860
It's the same character Cleese usually plays - same attitude, appearance, and voice.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.760
I'm just imagining that recording of John Cleese turning this role down.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.020
-"Oh please, c'mon, c'mon-"

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.780
Director:"Oh please. c'mon. c'mon-!"
Cleese:"Now, look here, I've done many things I'm not proud of."

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.320
"'Fievel Goes West', 'Beethoven's Christmas Adventure', 'Swan Princess'."

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.280
"But I'm drawing the line at 'The Tale of Two Titties'!"

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.360
Director:"Actually, it's 'Two Kitties.'"

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.160
Cleese:"I know what I said."

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:08.200
"Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to film 'The Adventures of Pluto Nash'."

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.720
Director:"Over our movie?!"

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.580
Cleese:"Not proudly, but firmly. Fuck off, pigs."

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.200
So while Prince is enjoying his continuous life of luxury,--

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.700
--Jesus Christ, I thought those were centaurs!

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.980
Connolly decides it's all water under the bridge, by placing Prince in water under the bridge.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.120
[splash]

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.500
So the animals try to foil whatever Connolly's evil plans are.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.160
-[Bugs Bunny] "Duck season!"
-[Daffy Duck] "Wabbit season!"

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.320
"You wouldn't want to injure the creatures, would you?"

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.800
No no, only aim for the orange ones, with celebrities mumbling swear words under their breath!

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.560
But Garfield decides, while in Britain, he should probably look around.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.880
"First let's grab some chow, before I eat your liver. With some fava beans and a nice chianti."

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.020
WHY do bad sequels think kids have seen 'Silence of the Lambs'?!

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.460
Do they play it on Cartoon Network? Did it do a crossover with 'Gumball'?

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:58.980
But one of the butlers comes across Garfield, of course mistaking him for Prince,

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.400
while Prince is in a nearby sewer.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.700
"Hello? Someone help a chap? I'm in the sewer."

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:11.820
Oh, c'mon, you have a Silence of the Lambs joke, yet you have Tim Curry in a sewer, and you don't do this?

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:17.940
[Pennywise from 'It'] "Hi Georgie! They float. They float...

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.860
"Here, here. I must return to my throne."

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.500
[barking]

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.440
"What ho?"

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.640
[NC, as Prince] "Huh. How come every animal in this movie can talk but you?"

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.400
"It didn't make sense in the comic strip either. Is ANYTHING in this movie improved on?!"

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.900
"Bathtime for you, buddy."

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.880
"Well, that's the best news I've heard all day. The dog's not very bright, is he?"

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.380
"Where are you taking me, is it somewhere lovely?"

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.400
You know, I understand that the humans can't hear the animals in this, but...

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:48.420
do they ever question why many of them have spastic movements, that seem eerily similar to human conversations?

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.880
What is it, feline with human attributes?

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.240
Well, this just seems totally normal to me. Should I be concerned?

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.740
Oh, I know! I'll use my feline with human attributes translator.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.860
Still not talking. Is this something just cats do?

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.160
No no no no no, we communicate just fine. She's just having a stroke.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.480
Come along, darling, we'll get you to a doctor.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.100
Meow.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.140
Take her to Liz the vet! I hear she's the next Jane Goodall.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:29.560
It looks like he was found just in time, as Connolly has evil plans to turn the giant estate into a spa!

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.920
Actually, that sounds lovely.

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.480
"Meditation garden, and of course, luxury condominium!"

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.420
"What will you...do with all the animals?"

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.700
"Those we don't chase off, we will serve up to the guests."

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:48.800
Okay, the animal thing is douchey, but with financial planners, I'm sure they'd find a way to either make profit on the farm,

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.620
or sell the animals in a way that would also make them profit.

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:55.140
I mean, what's the alternative? 
There's just a big house for a cat?

00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:00.260
Call me crazy, but I'm totally siding with the bad guy
 in this! Do something with that place!

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.160
Make it more than just a very expensive litterbox!

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:08.900
But screw that! Instead we have to have Garfield stand in for Prince so that the estate can...

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.360
continue to burn money!

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.860
"Oyez! Oyez!"

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:18.060
[NC, as dog] "Attention, animals that can sense things through smell, here is an obvious imposter!"

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:19.500
"Fall for it!"

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.140
"Dargis is going to bulldoze the barnyard and feed us to the tourists!"

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:26.160
"Let him try! He'll have to deal with these fists of fury, won't he?"

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.860
Yeah, he'll have to put up with our blank stares! Endure how unfocused we all are!

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:37.320
But Garfield is shown that him staying there is very important, as apparently the feline inbreeding is so thick

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:39.720
that there's literally not one difference in between them.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.460
"I've got a house inside of a house."

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:43.780
[fart]

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:44.640
"Ooh, blimey."

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:48.760
Hey, they got to the fart joke much slower than I originally expected they would!

00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.340
"Well struck, sire! Good tone! Smooth finish!"

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:59.200
Ohh, it's how Jim Davis reacted after seeing his creation destroyed, but held a big residual check at the same time.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.120
[singing "Movin' On Up"]

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:07.640
So Garfield enjoys the palace life, again, getting more exercise than we have ever seen this character get,

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.340
and doesn't even question the scary-as-hell singing paintings.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.900
[singing "Movin' On Up"]

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.880
You know, he's frightening enough in kind-of three dimensions,

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.860
we don't need to see if he's that frightening in two.

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:26.360
But Connolly, after a pretty long period of time passes, finally discovers that the cat is still there.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:31.640
"Bring some of those investors, those lovely investors! We'll throw a party! Cheerio!"

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.980
[NC, as Connolly] "Home to your greenscreen of England! You know we haven't had a sunny day here in eons!"

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.900
"Kill kitty! Kill kitty!"

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.620
So he trains a dog to rip Garfield to shreds, but it seems to backfire.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.920
[chomp]

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.280
[chomp]
[Connolly screaming]

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.120
Jee-hee-hee-zus! it's supposed to be a 
crotch shot, not castration!

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.000
This is like a 'Game of Thrones' death! Christ!

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:59.740
Meanwhile, Prince is being forced to enjoy common life while still being mistaken for Garfield.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.360
"Oh, good lord, what gruel is this?"

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:05.940
British food. Though I understand the comparison.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:34.760
Later in the day, Liz coincidentally takes a tour of the palace Garfield is in.

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.240
[mock scoff]
I'm as shocked as you!

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.640
"If I may...uh, one question, uh..."

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:42.700
-"Liz."

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:49.800
Not...VET Liz! Oh, thank God we got rid of that Goodall bitch, you're the real connection to the animal mind!

00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:54.900
"What would you say if I were to donate one of my priceless oil paintings?"

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.100
"That royal sleaze is hitting on Liz!"

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:02.460
[NC as Garfield] "The person I was trying to keep out of my life and now I suddenly care about for no reason!"

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:06.840
These transitions are as smooth as a Slip-N-Slide becoming a Slip-N-Sandpaper!

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.060
"You moron."

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:13.520
Connolly throws him in the dungeon, but his animal friends are there to help him get out.

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.460
"What, did you finally here my stomach growling?"

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.160
"No, but we heard your tiresome monologue."

00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.200
"Let's get you out of here, your royal highness."

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.680
Uhh, how exactly does this dungeon work?

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:32.900
You pull on the chains, like...ANYONE would do in a dungeon, especially if you're gonna handcuff somebody,

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.400
and THAT opens a way out?

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:39.760
Kind of counterproductive, isn't it? Do most villains have setups like that?

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.840
[evil laugh]

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.320
In five minutes, Batgirl, this whole room will fill with laughing gas!

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.580
Better figure a way out if you don't want a bad case of the giggles!

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.660
[evil laugh]

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.180
"..."

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:24.340
Outside the dungeon, Garfield finally comes face to face with a mirror in the garden!

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.420
[sputtering] Whaaaaaaaaaa??

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.780
You know, this is usually more impressive when PEOPLE are doing it.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:46.240
You know, instead of animated vomit stains that you can move however you want.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.940
Two people moving in exact unison is very impressive,

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:53.920
but when one animated cartoon moves exactly like the other animated cartoon,

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.120
it just kind of looks like you copied it.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:58.820
What's that, movie?

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:05.300
Oh, yes, of course, it looks SO realistic, 
I didn't even know it was CG!

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.100
"I'll bet he's just usin' that as an excuse."

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:10.980
But when Prince returns, it looks like he just wants to run away from Connolly.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:19.420
Garfield, again, in typical Garfield fashion, applies his bravery and self-motivation to inspire the others.

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:24.740
"You know, I have to believe we can do better. We don't leave. We stand and we kick royal butt."

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.380
Is it really that hard just to open one of these?

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:35.720
But this movie's not done trying to be the next 'Santa Paws', as all the animals come together to foil Connolly's plans.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.000
"Stupid cat!"

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:42.240
Oh, yeah, you never know when you might need a MACE! Good to have those lying around!

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.340
That must've been great on those tours we see all the time. "Feel free to touch the mace!

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:51.220
Take one home as a souvenir! It's a great form of punishment if you can't show 'em this movie!"

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.080
"Aahh! Something's biting me!"

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.720
After the animals give Connolly the runaround,
 he takes measures into his own hands.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.240
"And not a moment too soon."

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.360
-"Let her go."
-"All in good time."

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:09.120
Nooooooo! Not Liz! She was gonna cure animal cancer! That's LIZ!

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.700
But one weasel bites off another weasel...what's the point? We know there's nothing left up there!

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.820
And everybody seems to be safe.

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.480
"I've been trying to get the courage up to ask you something all week."

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.000
"Uh-huh?"

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.760
"Looking for something?"

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.340
"Liz, will you marry me?"

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.300
"Yes."

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:29.120
Ah yes! MARRIAGE. That's what this was all about.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:33.820
Garfield getting over his hatred of Liz and his love for Jon by...

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:39.640
being separated from them in most of the movie and learning absolute squat, tell me the credits are around the corner.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.360
Oh wow, it was like the next scene!

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:44.300
This...movie wants to end itself as much as I do!

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.720
So that was 'The Prince and the Pussy'- I mean 'Furry Tale Theater'- I mean 'A Tale of Two Kitties'.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:51.680
Yeah, seriously, why is it called that again?

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.460
It pretends to be funny, moralistic, and just like Garfield,

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:58.800
but it's dull, unfocused on the message, and has more to do with DENTAL SURGERY than Garfield.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.160
And it's probably more tolerable to sit through.

00:15:01.160 --> 00:15:05.320
Thank God there's only two of these movies because they only would've gotten worse and worse.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:11.860
They started from a place that had little to do with such a likable character, and only strayed further and further away.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:16.180
My advice is not to look at any of this kitty litter anytime soon.

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:23.080
And that's the last movie for Sequel Month, and thank God! Can you think of ANYTHING GOOD this experience has given us?

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:24.860
Hmmmmmm?

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.380
Bill? He's always been here. How could you forget Bill?

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.740
[Garfield] "You moron."

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.460
Hey, Doug Walker here, doing the Charity Shout-Out,

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:30.040
and this week, we are doing the Wounded Warriors Family Support.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:38.140
Their mission is to provide support to the families of those who have been wounded, injured or killed during combat operations.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:41.320
The families of their casualty suffer in many ways.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.800
Some financially, some psychologically.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:48.760
They're focused on so many different elements, like to promote and support philanthropy

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:53.000
through a program that is effective in providing all federal employees the opportunity

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.580
to improve the quality of life for all.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:17:03.220
The great thing is you can see the families they help out, as well as hear the amazing things these brave soldiers did.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:11.220
On both their website and their YouTube channel, you can see how this unbelievable bravery should, and is, being rewarded.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:12.840
At least with your help.

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:21.160
Take a look at all the sacrifices these people have made and see if you can give them, and their families, the "thank you" they deserve.

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:23.420
Definitely take a look.
