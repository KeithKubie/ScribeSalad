00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.360
You know, I'm one of those people
that likes to finish something

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.660
as soon as I think of it.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.090
If I think about something like
let's say picking out a flight.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.850
I'll just take out my phone and
start picking dates.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:14.220
And I found that I pretty often
encounter dropdown menus, usually for

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.460
things like dates.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.520
This seems reasonable, right?

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.300
Okay, I want you to watch this counter
that just popped up on your screen.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.170
It's going to count the number of taps
it takes for me to search for a flight.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.160
Are you ready?

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.660
Watch.

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:32.418
Did you catch that?

00:00:32.418 --> 00:00:35.209
Three taps to select a month.

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:36.501
Not a great start.

00:00:36.501 --> 00:00:37.668
Here, let me finish.

00:00:57.834 --> 00:01:00.917
[SOUND] Did you see how
many taps that took?

00:01:00.917 --> 00:01:02.418
It's ridiculous.

00:01:02.418 --> 00:01:05.545
Clearly, there must be a better
input than a dropdown.
