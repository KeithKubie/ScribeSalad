<v 1>What follows is a broad overview of the study of human language.</v>

3
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.980
Please explore this specific lesson,

5
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.720
What is linguistics? Well,

6
00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:23.840
we can use it as a term for nothing less than the study of language.

7
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.990
So how do we define human language and how can we study it?

8
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.390
That leads to a number of questions,

9
00:00:29.391 --> 00:00:31.970
both ancient and modern from the time of Panini,

10
00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:34.760
Sanskrit grammar to modern computational linguistics.

11
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.360
What are the building blocks of human language and how can we model,

12
00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:40.400
explain or account for natural language?

13
00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.680
Answering those questions leads directly to theory. Theoretical linguistics,

14
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.590
explorers, sound structure of individual languages,

15
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.970
the way speakers put sentences together, how speakers build words,

16
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.800
the role of meaning in language,

17
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.460
word choice and vocabulary and meaning and use in context.

18
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.780
But do we study speech or writing in our effort to explain human language?

19
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.340
Modern disciplines focus on spoken language as it's more spontaneous and

20
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:14.120
universal, but we can also learn and theorize about writing systems.

21
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.270
What if we focused on describing human language instead of modeling its

22
00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:21.320
structure more abstractly or theoretically.

23
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.300
From here we can head to comparing languages and we can show how they change

24
00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:29.540
over time and how one language relates to another. Genetically

25
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.430
Linguists can describe the real life spoken languages indigenous to peoples'

26
00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:36.710
Across the globe from a wide range of cultures.

27
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.110
They can describe the social variation of a language within a single culture and

28
00:01:42.111 --> 00:01:45.500
even how humans make speech sounds and four marks on the page to write.

29
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.780
What if we ask instead? How is language relevant to everyday life?

30
00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.840
Languages learned taught process by computers like which relies on human

31
00:01:57.531 --> 00:01:58.364
biology,

32
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.870
languages intertwined with the role of the brain and its functions and it has

33
00:02:02.871 --> 00:02:06.710
many other applications. Let's take one last angle.

34
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.830
What tools do we use to study human language?

35
00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.840
These include field notes, grammar books, parse streets,

36
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.010
dusty manuscripts, statistical models and data sects,

37
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:20.570
derivations,

38
00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.370
spectrograms and just plain mental analysis and questioning to mention,

39
00:02:25.371 --> 00:02:27.590
but a few linguistic tools drawn in random order.

40
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.210
There are many questions to ask about natural language and many ways to talk and

41
00:02:32.211 --> 00:02:33.290
think about languages.

42
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.250
I hope this top level slice gives you a taste of the variety of approaches

43
00:02:37.251 --> 00:02:38.270
available to you.
