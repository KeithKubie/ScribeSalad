Android product in our first version of
 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.440
Android product in our first version of
our app we focused on UI elements that

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450
our app we focused on UI elements that
 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.180
our app we focused on UI elements that
we thought would communicate to users

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190
we thought would communicate to users
 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.740
we thought would communicate to users
how to move from screen to screen or

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750
how to move from screen to screen or
 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.200
how to move from screen to screen or
navigate between tabs and use a mini

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
navigate between tabs and use a mini
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.569
navigate between tabs and use a mini
player so we had our own way of doing

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579
player so we had our own way of doing
 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.840
player so we had our own way of doing
this and it really was this big bar

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850
this and it really was this big bar
 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.470
this and it really was this big bar
across the screen and it said swipe here

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480
across the screen and it said swipe here
 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.139
across the screen and it said swipe here
and we thought that you know this UI

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149
and we thought that you know this UI
 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.580
and we thought that you know this UI
element was going to be extremely

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590
element was going to be extremely
 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.950
element was going to be extremely
successful and what we found is people

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960
successful and what we found is people
 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.410
successful and what we found is people
just weren't seeing it so we we moved

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420
just weren't seeing it so we we moved
 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.270
just weren't seeing it so we we moved
over to Google UI element that really is

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280
over to Google UI element that really is
 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.250
over to Google UI element that really is
being used in places like the Play Store

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
being used in places like the Play Store
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.890
being used in places like the Play Store
and so at first we didn't think that

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900
and so at first we didn't think that
 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.810
and so at first we didn't think that
this UI element was as prominent and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820
this UI element was as prominent and
 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.570
this UI element was as prominent and
what we found was when we released it

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580
what we found was when we released it
 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.960
what we found was when we released it
and tested it on our listeners we found

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970
and tested it on our listeners we found
 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.249
and tested it on our listeners we found
that it was actually much more

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
that it was actually much more
 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.410
that it was actually much more
successful than the feature that we had

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420
successful than the feature that we had
 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.749
successful than the feature that we had
in place and as a result people were

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759
in place and as a result people were
 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.480
in place and as a result people were
discovering new and a new great content

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490
discovering new and a new great content
 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.460
discovering new and a new great content
that they wanted to listen to so it

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470
that they wanted to listen to so it
 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.760
that they wanted to listen to so it
ended up moving our our most important

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
ended up moving our our most important
 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.319
ended up moving our our most important
engagement metric which was listening

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329
engagement metric which was listening
 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.330
engagement metric which was listening
hours and then as a result people were

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340
hours and then as a result people were
 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.069
hours and then as a result people were
finding really great content that they

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079
finding really great content that they
 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.200
finding really great content that they
wanted to listen to on our platform and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210
wanted to listen to on our platform and
 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.569
wanted to listen to on our platform and
they were finding more reasons to come

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579
they were finding more reasons to come
 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.520
they were finding more reasons to come
back and listen to tune in what we found

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530
back and listen to tune in what we found
 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.929
back and listen to tune in what we found
was by implementing fragments google is

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939
was by implementing fragments google is
 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.819
was by implementing fragments google is
helping us handle all these different

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829
helping us handle all these different
 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.840
helping us handle all these different
device sizes and resolutions so that we

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850
device sizes and resolutions so that we
 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.670
device sizes and resolutions so that we
were creating a really great user

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680
were creating a really great user
 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.850
were creating a really great user
experience on different platforms and so

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860
experience on different platforms and so
 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.380
experience on different platforms and so
I'm gonna show off a little bit about

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390
I'm gonna show off a little bit about
 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.389
I'm gonna show off a little bit about
fragments if I come in here you can see

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399
fragments if I come in here you can see
 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.429
fragments if I come in here you can see
that there are three different fragments

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
that there are three different fragments
 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.330
that there are three different fragments
on the browsing side of this screen so

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340
on the browsing side of this screen so
 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.080
on the browsing side of this screen so
the first is here

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090
the first is here
 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.800
the first is here
the second is here and then the third is

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810
the second is here and then the third is
 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.229
the second is here and then the third is
as you choose a particular genre of

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239
as you choose a particular genre of
 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.960
as you choose a particular genre of
music to consume there's another

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970
music to consume there's another
 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.970
music to consume there's another
fragment over here on the side and so

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980
fragment over here on the side and so
 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.210
fragment over here on the side and so
you'll see this with our little mini

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220
you'll see this with our little mini
 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.690
you'll see this with our little mini
player and this fragment moves from the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700
player and this fragment moves from the
 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.059
player and this fragment moves from the
side of the screen during a tablet UI to

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069
side of the screen during a tablet UI to
 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.309
side of the screen during a tablet UI to
the bottom of the screen during a phone

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319
the bottom of the screen during a phone
 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.970
the bottom of the screen during a phone
UI and what we did is we invested once

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980
UI and what we did is we invested once
 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.000
UI and what we did is we invested once
and then Google is helping us through

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010
and then Google is helping us through
 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.850
and then Google is helping us through
this process conformed to all the

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860
this process conformed to all the
 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.490
this process conformed to all the
different types of screen sizes that

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500
different types of screen sizes that
 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.470

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160
we can show them the world of live
 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.479
we can show them the world of live
content as it happens so this is our

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489

every two and a half to three months so
 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.170
every two and a half to three months so
what that gives us the ability to do is

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180
what that gives us the ability to do is
 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.199
what that gives us the ability to do is
lean into the new features that Google

puts it out into their releases so when
an example of this is rich notifications

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:18.639
an example of this is rich notifications
 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:20.370
an example of this is rich notifications
and you'll see that we made it really

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380
