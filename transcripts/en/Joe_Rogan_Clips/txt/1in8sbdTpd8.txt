Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience

Speaker 2:          00:02          and I couldn't agree more. My hope is that what you were saying and what we were discussing earlier about how the Internet has sort of eroded our faith in many institutions as being the only or the primary source of knowledge that I hope that that takes place globally in terms of the way we view government. Yeah. And that we do that. Your idea of like, I love what America stands for and what America stands for is kind of a nation. That's where people go to, you know, this is one of the more insidious problems with this idea of building walls and keeping people out and making it incredibly difficult to get here. The reason why I'm here is because it was pretty easy to get here. Yeah. That's why I'm here.

Speaker 1:          00:45          That's not, that's the essence of America. A free and open society come here and do better.

Speaker 2:          00:49          Yes. That's the whole idea behind it and I would hope that this idea of being able to just, if you want to do manner that you can anywhere in the world, this could eventually spread out. Yes. This is my hope.

Speaker 1:          01:04          I believe it can spread out and, and um, you know, I see many signs of hope, uh, in, in, in America. America has become a big part of my life, not just because I wrote this book, but because I have children who are now living in America. I have a son and daughter in law who, who live in La. I have another son and daughter in law who live in Boston. America. I'm British, but America has become a very central part of my life and it's a fascinating and amazing country and it's been my privilege to travel thousands of miles across America, across many, many, many different states. And I, I love this country. It's, it's, it's an amazing place. Only in America could we see happening. What has happened with cannabis, you know, the, the, the fact that at a, at a local level, individuals have got together, mobilized petitions, organized votes, and changed the law, change the law.

Speaker 1:          01:56          Diff, literally stuck a finger up at central government and said, fuck off. This is none of your business. What I do with my consciousness in the inner sanctum of my own life is not the business of the state. That's a very American feeling. It's something that you don't find often in other countries where the state is granted much more power and much more authority than it perhaps should be. Americans are naturally questioning of government authority and that has, that is what has led to the legalization increasing legalization of cannabis, which is going to change the world in lots of ways. But then ironically at the same time, see the thing about democracies is that in order to, um, get things done in a democracy, you need to persuade people of your point of view. So information becomes very important in, in democracies and the information can be abused, people can be misled with information. They can be told that what they're receiving is the truth, whereas in fact, it's not the truth. And you can end up with a kind of dictatorship that the people have given their ascent to on the of of false

Speaker 2:          03:00          information. And frankly, I'd rather have a real dictatorship, which is, which is out in the open and clear rather than one that has been subtly manipulated into position through manipulating the, the, the, the views of the, of, of, of the voters. But I am and remain enormously encouraged by America. It may seem like a trivial issue, but the fact that state by state cannabis is being legalized and that is resulting from a grassroots movement that this enormous change has been made either. It's ironic, it's strange that at the federal level, even though what eight states now totally legal for recreational, uh, 23, 24 states legal for medical use, that at the federal level, it's still a schedule one controlled, controlled drug. This is a huge state of dissonance that exists in America is going to have to put it right. What it says to me is that people can change things, people can get together at the local level and they can make a better world because there's no doubt that the cannabis laws were vicious and wrong and cruel and evil and ruined people's lives for, for, for decades.

Speaker 2:          04:00          And it's people who've changed that it's not government has changed, that it's the people at the grassroots level in America is a country where that can happen. And I, I remain encouraged about about the role of the American people while often in despair about the role of the American state. Yeah. I'm encouraged as well. And you know, it's interesting, Ben and Jerry released something yesterday, which was really are on four 20 I should say, which was talking about the drug laws in this country. And, and talking about how many, it's real really opening this, the, the idea of like how unjust these laws were and how many of these laws targeted people of color and how many people who are white people have profited off of this and how many people are still in jail. Yes. For crimes that they committed, you know, air quote crimes that are no longer cry that are no longer crimes.

Speaker 2:          04:48          Yeah. And this is ridiculous. These, these records should be expunged. They should, because I see that California has made some steps in that direction. There has been some expunging of course. Well, we can only hope that also what opens up next is silicide Ben is now going to be on the ballot. Absolutely. And when that opens up, I mean what you really think marijuana is a gateway drug. Well guess what it is if silicide gets in. Yes. Cause Psilocybin can legitimately change the world yet so and can't really, I mean I think marijuana can change the world and I really do think that cannabis is changing people's perceptions and making people more calm and friendly and yeah, and even the, what they talk about with paranoia. I welcome that. And the reason why I welcome that as I think people are entirely too cocky. Yeah. The, the life we live as bizarre as you could ever imagine book and we're just accustomed to it because it's our day to day for granted. Yeah. Marijuana removes those blinders and it really makes you understand that this is a strange, strange life. And these, a lot of these pitfalls and problems that we have in our society are due to fear and they're due to ignorance and their, their due to this, this lack of connection with

Speaker 1:          05:58          each other and cannabis and many of these other psychedelic drugs, they encourage this connection with each other, which is I think what we need. It's, it's certainly what we need. And, and, and it's an aberration in human culture that we've created a society that demonized the, the substances and that made them illegal. It's a relatively recent thing. It's really just the last, the last hundred years. It's, uh, it's, it's a tiny part of the human story. And yet we were so arrogant as a society that we could set aside thousands of years of human tradition and experience and wisdom working with the plant medicines. We just set it aside, turn them into criminal substances and say, we know everything. What a, what a huge and stupid mistake that is, um, on cannabis as a quote unquote gateway drug. It absolutely is in this sense that the legalization of cannabis is going to open the doors to, as, as you say, to the legalization of, of psychedelics.

Speaker 1:          06:49          Because what's happening is that the population is completely waking up to the fact that they have been bullshitted and lied to about cannabis for the best part of a century. And once that dawns on people, the realization at a direct personal level, here's this herb I love, I have been lied to, systematically misinformed by central government, uh, about this, about this herb that leads to questioning of everything that central government does. And so in that sense, it is a gateway to a questioning society. The psychedelics are different in that, in that Psilocybin, um, actually does lead you to question stuff. It leads you to really ask questions about, about everything, about your role in the world, about you as a person, about how you relate to other people and about the whole system on this planet and the, the beautiful, gorgeous planet that we, that we have and what we're doing to it.

Speaker 1:          07:44          That also enters, enters awareness. So it erodes confidence and authority. And it also roads, confidence and authority that doesn't have experiences that you've experienced. That's the part of the problem is that these people that are holding people back from these psychedelic experiences, they've never had them. They've never had, they don't even know what they're rallying. That coming to it from a place of fear and prejudice, uh, there simply accepting stuff that they'd been told without really thinking it through and, and, and examining it. And again, it's a failure of, of what human beings should, should be doing. We have to get, we have to get rid of this fear. And ironically it's bad for them as well. I've taught for the people that are actually encouraging this, these laws to be enforced. Yes. Is it bad for, it's bad for the whole of the whole of society because it is healthy for a, for a society where adults become self realized, individuals where they make their own responsible choices about their own lives, where they don't say, oh, government met must make this choice for me.

Speaker 1:          08:41          That's the next step for humanity. We start, we need to start becoming our own leaders and making our own choices and that is that is what's being revealed now that we're getting to the skull beneath the smile of the war on drugs. We're realizing that it's part of a big program of lying that has been about keeping people's minds closed down, not wanting free thinking. I've made this point several times, but our society is not against altered states of consciousness. As such a, our society will allow big Pharma to make billions of dollars with drugs that alter consciousness like Ciroc, satin, Prozac, antidepressants, which in my opinion having had some experience of them are amongst the most horrible drugs on the planet. They are very harmful, very dangerous drugs, but they're completely legal and they're encouraged with our system. Likewise, alcohol, very dangerous drug causes, fights, causes drunk driving accidents, leads to cirrhosis of the liver, completely legal and open.

Speaker 1:          09:35          Our society is not against altered states of consciousness as such. It's against particular kinds of altered states of consciousness that lead to questioning of the existing control system. That's what's, that's what's going on here, here, here. Well said. And as you know, I have my own story with, uh, with, with cannabis and well, you and I had a moment. We had a moment which was, which was quite a life changing moment for me because I, if I may just rehearse a little bit of this for the audience. Um, in 2011 I had a series of Iowasca sessions, uh, in which it was shown to me that I was using cannabis completely wrong. Uh, that did become a dominant force in my life that it was making me, you're speaking about paranoia and I agree with your paranoia is a, is a useful thing if only to overcome it.

Speaker 1:          10:23          That it was making me paranoid that it was making me suspicious that I approached everybody around me in a state of suspicion and I was shown this by Iowasca and then given a very strong message, you need to quit cannabis. What I didn't realize at the time is that the problem was not cannabis. The problem was me, uh, that I needed to fix those aspects of myself before I could have a proper relationship with cannabis. So after that IOWASCA session, having smoked cannabis for decades, literally 16 hours a day, seven days a week, I quit. I quit for three years. And then I'm on your show and we're sitting, we're setting up one another as we are now. And you asked me a question, um, are you still off the cannabis and that? And I say, well, I'm thinking of dipping my toes back in the water, at which point you produce a joint and, and we smoke it together at first of all, after three years, your tolerance is way down on cannabis.

Speaker 1:          11:18          I got really stoned. I did listen to that interview back in. Somehow I held it together together brilliantly. You opened up and there was like a wave of information came pouring out of you. It was wonderful. It wasn't liberation for me. And what it said to me is it's time to go back to cannabis. Uh, but perhaps in a different way. It doesn't, it, I need a different relationship with this amazing medicine. And, and if I can forge that, if I can make that different relationship happen, then it can be a constructive and positive part of my life. And I can say definitely that that has been the case. And that's excellent. And so it's all thanks to you, Joe. I probably would still be off cannabis if it hadn't been for that joint.
