00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:13.126
You may think you know the words
that sit plainly in black on your page,

00:00:13.126 --> 00:00:14.828
but don't be fooled.

00:00:14.828 --> 00:00:18.975
Some words are capable of taking on
different guises,

00:00:18.975 --> 00:00:22.736
masquerading as nouns,
verbs and adjectives

00:00:22.736 --> 00:00:25.625
that alter their meanings entirely.

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:29.639
This seeming superpower is called
lexical ambiguity.

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:34.880
It can turn words and sentences
into mazes that mess with our minds.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.030
For example, consider the following:

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.810
Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo
buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.050
That may sound like nonsense,

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.591
but it's actually a grammatically 
correct sentence.

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:55.465
How? Well, Buffalo is proper noun,
a noun, and a verb.

00:00:55.465 --> 00:00:58.649
It refers to an animal 
also known as a bison,

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.024
an American city,

00:01:00.024 --> 00:01:03.718
and it can also mean to bully.

00:01:03.718 --> 00:01:06.772
These different interpretations
create a sequence of words

00:01:06.772 --> 00:01:10.243
that is grammatically 
correct as it stands,

00:01:10.243 --> 00:01:12.897
though it helps to add in 
a few implied phrases

00:01:12.897 --> 00:01:17.243
and punctuation marks
to reveal what's really going on.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:20.264
Buffalo buffalo are bison 
from the city of Buffalo,

00:01:20.264 --> 00:01:22.828
and this sentence 
has three groups of them.

00:01:22.828 --> 00:01:27.831
Group A, which is bullied by Group B,
bullies Group C.

00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:31.405
In other words, bison from Buffalo that
other bison from Buffalo bully

00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:34.228
also bully bison from Buffalo.

00:01:34.228 --> 00:01:38.957
If you let each buffalo perform its role,
the meaning becomes apparent.

00:01:38.957 --> 00:01:42.762
What if the bunch of bullying buffalo
decides to cross the ocean?

00:01:42.762 --> 00:01:44.412
Not just on any ship,

00:01:44.412 --> 00:01:47.588
but a ship-shipping ship 
shipping shipping-ships?

00:01:47.588 --> 00:01:52.114
That sentence sounds just as outrageous,
but there's logic to the babble.

00:01:52.114 --> 00:01:56.322
Ship can mean a vessel and to transport.

00:01:56.322 --> 00:01:59.851
When we sub in those meanings,
a clearer picture emerges.

00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:02.168
Here we have a huge ship-carrying vessel

00:02:02.168 --> 00:02:07.859
transporting ships that themselves are
designed to carry goods across the sea.

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:10.812
A ship-shipping ship, 
shipping shipping-ships.

00:02:10.812 --> 00:02:14.626
How about some entertainment
on board this unusual vessel

00:02:14.626 --> 00:02:17.163
to offset the scuffling buffalo?

00:02:17.163 --> 00:02:19.293
Consider the can-can.

00:02:19.293 --> 00:02:24.136
Can-can can-can can can
can can can-can.

00:02:24.136 --> 00:02:27.127
Here, the word can comes in many guises.

00:02:27.127 --> 00:02:29.379
There's can-can, the flamboyant dance,

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.653
can, that means able to,

00:02:31.653 --> 00:02:35.894
and can, figuratively 
meaning to outperform.

00:02:35.894 --> 00:02:39.243
By sticking in a comma
and including the implied meanings,

00:02:39.243 --> 00:02:41.640
this sentence becomes clearer.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.213
Can-can dances that can-can dances
are able to outperform,

00:02:46.213 --> 00:02:49.706
can also outperform other can-can dances.

00:02:49.706 --> 00:02:53.913
You wouldn't necessarily use
any of these sentences in a conversation.

00:02:53.913 --> 00:02:55.689
They're just too ridiculous.

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:57.549
Yet they serve as an extreme example

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.527
on just how tangled 
everyday language can be.

00:03:01.527 --> 00:03:06.165
Lexical ambiguities sail into our speech
and writing all the time,

00:03:06.165 --> 00:03:11.353
spreading confusion and misunderstanding
wherever they can-can.
