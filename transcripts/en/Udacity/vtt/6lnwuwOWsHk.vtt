00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.430
The later that a software development problem is detected,

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.440
the more expensive it is to fix it.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.880
Hence, we want to find problems as early as possible in the process.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.340
Reviews are a cost effective way to find problems in all kinds of artifacts,

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.020
including design documents.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.830
Going further, we want to detect deep problems if we can.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.640
And reviews run the risk of revealing shallow problems with a document self or

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.780
with superficial aspects of the design.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.190
To reveal deep problems requires exposure of the design to

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.270
experienced designers who are among the most highly paid and

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.470
time stressed people in the development process.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.815
Therefore it makes sense to have the design review be as focused and

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:38.290
well-run as possible.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.260
To do this reviews should be institutionalized.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.350
By that I mean, they should be a formally defined process element and

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.920
part of the corporate culture.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.750
By doing so, the short-term costs involved in conducting reviews will be

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.060
more than offset by the eventual saving on reduced maintenance and

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.720
increased customer satisfaction.
