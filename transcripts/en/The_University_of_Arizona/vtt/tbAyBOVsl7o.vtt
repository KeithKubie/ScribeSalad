MARTHA MCSALLY: We have got to continue
on with their legacy and honor them

00:00:06.056 --> 00:00:08.106
and there's no better, fitting way to do

00:00:08.106 --> 00:00:11.676
that than this memorial here
at the University of Arizona.

00:00:11.916 --> 00:00:18.036
[people clapping] [planes overhead] MCSALLY: As we go by this every single day

00:00:18.476 --> 00:00:21.906
as those who are able to just, on their way
to school, or those of us who visit from time

00:00:21.906 --> 00:00:26.276
to time or go out to do special run
for some event or whatever it is -

00:00:26.746 --> 00:00:29.856
may we stop and we look at the names.

00:00:29.956 --> 00:00:36.046
May we remember -may we remember and not
forget- the service, the sacrifice, the courage,

00:00:37.386 --> 00:00:39.496
freedom is only one generation
away from losing it.

00:00:39.836 --> 00:00:44.026
And we have people fighting as we speak on
the front lines in order to keep us free.

00:00:44.536 --> 00:00:58.906
So let's have a fitting honor of their
memory and let's continue to forge and fight

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:15.246
for freedom and liberty and God
bless you all and God Bless America.
