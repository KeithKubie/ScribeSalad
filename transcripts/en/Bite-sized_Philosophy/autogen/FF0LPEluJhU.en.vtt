00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.080
acting out a deception they're a persona
in the Union sense so the persona is the

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090
in the Union sense so the persona is the
 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.869
in the Union sense so the persona is the
mask you wear in public that you might

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879
mask you wear in public that you might
 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.840
mask you wear in public that you might
even think you are but you're not it's

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850
even think you are but you're not it's
 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.670
even think you are but you're not it's
this mask and that's the actor that's

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680
this mask and that's the actor that's
 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.760
this mask and that's the actor that's
the persona so the Fox and the cat are

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770
the persona so the Fox and the cat are
 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.460
the persona so the Fox and the cat are
inviting that the puppet to only become

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470
inviting that the puppet to only become
 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.910
inviting that the puppet to only become
a persona and and that's that's see for

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
a persona and and that's that's see for
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.600
a persona and and that's that's see for
young you start as a persona and then

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
young you start as a persona and then
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.999
young you start as a persona and then
when you start to investigate the parts

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009
when you start to investigate the parts
 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.380
when you start to investigate the parts
of you that don't really fit in that

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390
of you that don't really fit in that
 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.510
of you that don't really fit in that
persona that would be the shadow then

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520
persona that would be the shadow then
 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.039
persona that would be the shadow then
you start understanding who you really

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049
you start understanding who you really
 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.980
you start understanding who you really
are and that's shocking because the

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
are and that's shocking because the
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.899
are and that's shocking because the
persona contains everything roughly

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
persona contains everything roughly
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.640
persona contains everything roughly
speaking that you think is good and

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650
speaking that you think is good and
 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.410
speaking that you think is good and
maybe even that your immediate culture

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
maybe even that your immediate culture
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.179
maybe even that your immediate culture
thinks is good and then the shadow

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189
thinks is good and then the shadow
 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.130
thinks is good and then the shadow
contains everything that's not part of

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140
contains everything that's not part of
 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.460
contains everything that's not part of
that and some of that's really bad but

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
that and some of that's really bad but
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.580
that and some of that's really bad but
some of it is good disguised as bad and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
some of it is good disguised as bad and
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.859
some of it is good disguised as bad and
you can't break out of the persona and

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
you can't break out of the persona and
 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.499
you can't break out of the persona and
transcend it until you incorporate a lot

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509
transcend it until you incorporate a lot
 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.060
transcend it until you incorporate a lot
of what's in the shadow and so for

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070
of what's in the shadow and so for
 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.490
of what's in the shadow and so for
example if you're an extraordinarily

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500
example if you're an extraordinarily
 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.830
example if you're an extraordinarily
compassionate person let's say 98% L

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840
compassionate person let's say 98% L
 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.980
compassionate person let's say 98% L
will say you're going to be sacrificing

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990
will say you're going to be sacrificing
 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.359
will say you're going to be sacrificing
yourself to other people all the time

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369
yourself to other people all the time
 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.910
yourself to other people all the time
and there are people who will find that

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920
and there are people who will find that
 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.639
and there are people who will find that
extraordinarily endearing and it will be

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649
extraordinarily endearing and it will be
 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.619
extraordinarily endearing and it will be
under some circumstances but the problem

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629
under some circumstances but the problem
 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.630
under some circumstances but the problem
is is that you will sacrifice yourself

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640
is is that you will sacrifice yourself
 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.430
is is that you will sacrifice yourself
and that's a really bad attitude

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440
and that's a really bad attitude
 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.500
and that's a really bad attitude
have for example towards adult males

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510
have for example towards adult males
 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.630
have for example towards adult males
it's a great thing for infants but for

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640
it's a great thing for infants but for
 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.790
it's a great thing for infants but for
adult males it is the wrong approach and

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800
adult males it is the wrong approach and
 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.670
adult males it is the wrong approach and
so you will get taken advantage of

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680
so you will get taken advantage of
 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.650
so you will get taken advantage of
continually by people who are looking

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660
continually by people who are looking
 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.870
continually by people who are looking
for someone like you until you grow some

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880
for someone like you until you grow some
 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.440
for someone like you until you grow some
teeth and you'll think no no that's the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450
teeth and you'll think no no that's the
 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.360
teeth and you'll think no no that's the
opposite of compassion being able to

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370
opposite of compassion being able to
 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.850
opposite of compassion being able to
bite hard is the opposite of compassion

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860
bite hard is the opposite of compassion
 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.580
bite hard is the opposite of compassion
which it is and so you'll have that

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590
which it is and so you'll have that
 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.710
which it is and so you'll have that
pushed into the predator category I'm

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720
pushed into the predator category I'm
 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.450
pushed into the predator category I'm
not doing that I'm not getting angry I

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460
not doing that I'm not getting angry I
 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.580
not doing that I'm not getting angry I
don't like conflict it's like until you

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590
don't like conflict it's like until you
 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.400
don't like conflict it's like until you
bring that out of the depths and put it

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410
bring that out of the depths and put it
 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.920
bring that out of the depths and put it
on so you can use it you're gonna be in

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930
on so you can use it you're gonna be in
 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.810
on so you can use it you're gonna be in
trouble and that's kind of Nietzsche's

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820
trouble and that's kind of Nietzsche's
 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.940
trouble and that's kind of Nietzsche's
idea of the revaluation of good and evil

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950
idea of the revaluation of good and evil
 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.430
idea of the revaluation of good and evil
right you have a sense of what's good in

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440
right you have a sense of what's good in
 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.140
right you have a sense of what's good in
a sense of what isn't with your

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150
a sense of what isn't with your
 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.150
a sense of what isn't with your
conscience but it's not very smart it's

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160
conscience but it's not very smart it's
 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.340
conscience but it's not very smart it's
got things in the wrong boxes and a lot

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350
got things in the wrong boxes and a lot
 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.290
got things in the wrong boxes and a lot
of the things that even nature itself a

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300
of the things that even nature itself a
 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.110
of the things that even nature itself a
lot of the things that you accept as

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120
lot of the things that you accept as
 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.850
lot of the things that you accept as
untrammeled goods like compassion let's

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860
untrammeled goods like compassion let's
 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.520
untrammeled goods like compassion let's
say have a very dark side first of all

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530
say have a very dark side first of all
 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.010
say have a very dark side first of all
and second are not enough to get you

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020
and second are not enough to get you
 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.720
and second are not enough to get you
through life you need the opposite

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730
through life you need the opposite
 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.150
through life you need the opposite
virtues too and so you have to develop

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160
virtues too and so you have to develop
 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.140
virtues too and so you have to develop
them and so you get outside the persona

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150
them and so you get outside the persona
 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.470
them and so you get outside the persona
to do that but anyways Pinocchio is

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480
to do that but anyways Pinocchio is
 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.440
to do that but anyways Pinocchio is
invited to be a false persona to take

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450
invited to be a false persona to take
 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.479
invited to be a false persona to take
the gains of celebrity without having to

the gains of celebrity without having to
do anything to be educated he's just
