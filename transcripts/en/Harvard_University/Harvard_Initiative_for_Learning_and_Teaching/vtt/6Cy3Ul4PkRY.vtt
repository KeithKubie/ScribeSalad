00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.349
Well, first of all, thank
you all for being here.

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:09.390
My name is Marty Samuels.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.580
I work at the art center,
I'm the associate director

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.880
of science and learning.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.072
And I have two of
my colleagues who I

00:00:18.072 --> 00:00:20.169
get to share this session with.

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:22.460
But really the session is
--and I'll let them introduce

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.460
themselves--

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.380
but really I want to focus
this session on an opportunity

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.350
to hear from the students who
are so kind to actually join us

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.860
today, so we can hear about
their experiences both--

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.500
how have they received good--

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.470
dealt with good feedback of
teacher evaluation in a class.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.290
And what are some
examples of-- that

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.070
have been more
challenging, which they've

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.040
tried to provide teacher
feedback to their class

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.750
and has not worked out well,
but has it gone according

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.560
to their plans as a student.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.500
With that, I'm going
to ask each student

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.995
to introduce him or herself.

00:00:55.995 --> 00:00:57.850
And maybe start off
with a short story--

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:58.350
Wait.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.153
Before we do that,
can we do this?

00:01:00.153 --> 00:01:02.410
With the class chart thing?

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.019
Yeah.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.968
Before we do start the
panel, I'm Johanna Gutlerner.

00:01:06.968 --> 00:01:08.800
I work at Harvard
Medical School.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.020
I'm a associate dean for
planning and administration

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.080
and grad ed basic science
and global programs.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.660
A lot to say.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.620
But we would just
ask you to start out

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.757
by answering this
question for us, which--

00:01:22.757 --> 00:01:23.715
Jason, want to read it?

00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:24.751
In case people can't--

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:25.250
Sorry.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.750
Yeah.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.680
Please write down
one question informed

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.013
by the previous sessions were
otherwise, which you would

00:01:30.013 --> 00:01:31.950
you like to have our
panelists address over

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.470
the course of this session.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.398
We'll collect those on
the card and integrate

00:01:34.398 --> 00:01:36.260
into the discussion
in the second half.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.730
But if you have
something that you

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.402
would like to make sure
we raise in this session,

00:01:40.402 --> 00:01:42.110
this is just our
attempt to collect that.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.310
And if you want to pose
a question yourself,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.240
just please write your name on
the card so we know you are.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.010
And specifically, we're lucky
to have our actual stakeholders

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.650
in learning and teaching here
in this session so specifically

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.620
questions that you want to
ask our student panelists.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.940
So maybe we'll give you a
couple minutes to do that

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.275
and then they can
introduce themselves.

00:02:05.275 --> 00:02:06.850
And can we also
write down questions

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.076
as they start talking?

00:02:08.076 --> 00:02:08.750
Absolutely, yes.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.250
There will be lots
more opportunity.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.355
These ones were just--

00:02:11.355 --> 00:02:15.410
going to ask some
pre-forum questions.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.910
All right.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.900
So we'll come around
and collect those,

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.250
but maybe now we can ask
our student panelists

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.630
to just introduce
themselves and then we

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.543
had asked that each of
them tell about a four

00:02:28.543 --> 00:02:32.060
or five minute story
relevant to today's topic.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.230
And then after we
hear from them we'll

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.510
have you guys
think a little bit.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.640
We may ask you to
talk to each other,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.650
so if you're at a table
with no colleagues

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.500
you may want to move somewhere
where there's other people

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.680
to talk to.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.170
And then we'll return and ask--

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.345
have a conversation
about we heard.

00:02:55.345 --> 00:02:58.060
Christopher, do you want
to introduce yourself

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.030
to the group?

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.190
I'm Chris Li.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.660
I'm a senior at Harvard College.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.070
I'm studying Human Developmental
and Regenerative Biology, which

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.820
is under the Scrub Department
Stem Cell Regenerative Biology

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.310
and I'm also doing a
minor in Government.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.410
I've dabbled around in
the different science

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.490
majors for a little bit, so
I actually spent a semester

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.150
as a Chemical and
Physical Biology major,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.000
but the divisions between
the different concentrations

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.160
are pretty subtle and so
it's easy to move around.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.130
One story I thought I would
share is about a class that--

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.160
it was a pretty large class
that most life science students

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.300
teach here at Harvard--

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.690
or take here at Harvard, sorry.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.310
And it's one of
those classes where

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.810
everyone has an
impression, I think,

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.220
before you enter the class.

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.060
And it's a requirement for all
students going through pre-med,

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.930
going through any biology
or chemistry major.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.330
And this course
had traditionally

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.530
been taught by Harvard
faculty and was

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.280
taught by one or two members
who rotated back and forth

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.430
and there was a very defined
system of doing things.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.380
And the other notable
aspect was that it

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.170
was the second semester to a
two semester sequence and so--

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.190
I won't name the
class, but I think

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.570
it might be easy to discern
what class this was.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.500
And so the students
in this class

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.900
were obviously very conscious,
very worried about doing well.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.545
I mean, most of them were very
interested in the material

00:04:25.545 --> 00:04:26.800
and it was--

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.470
I would say most students are
probably certainly invested

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.600
in actually learning,
but it was also

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.790
an environment
where students were

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.740
focused on the outcome on
their transcript as well.

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.860
And so this course was the
second semester in sequence

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.310
and the first semester in
previous years have been done

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.340
the standard way with
a lot of PowerPoint's.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.300
It was very--

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.760
I guess, packaged
for students so there

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.894
was very little reading
textbooks, synthesizing notes,

00:04:51.894 --> 00:04:52.810
going to office hours.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.575
Everything was condensed to
one sheet of paper given out

00:04:56.575 --> 00:04:57.371
to you every week.

00:04:57.371 --> 00:04:58.620
PowerPoint slides were posted.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.820
They actually posted
annotated slides,

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.950
there were lecture
videos, so everything.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.908
You practically didn't
even have to go to class

00:05:04.908 --> 00:05:07.120
or read a textbook and you
could get that material.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.190
And the problem sets
are very straightforward

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.240
and everything was
well done in a way

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.142
that I think was overly
generous to the students.

00:05:14.142 --> 00:05:16.350
We actually had a professor
teach the second semester

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.790
of the sequence who wasn't
a Harvard faculty member,

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:22.150
he was a visiting professor
and he decided to do everything

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.180
completely differently.

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:25.630
And so he took a very
traditionalist approach, which

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.420
I think for the subject matter,
actually is not necessarily

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.550
a bad thing.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.510
Everything was done
at the chalkboard.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.630
There were no slides,
there were no handouts,

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.520
and he expected you
read the textbook,

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.320
simplifying things yourself.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.360
And there was a huge amount of--

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.440
I would say backlash
or unhappiness

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:46.100
with this form of teaching.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.750
He would also cold call and so--

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:49.360
I mean, it was a
large lecture class,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.232
but he would call
on students and ask

00:05:51.232 --> 00:05:53.440
them to answer questions
regardless of whether or not

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:56.180
they were right or wrong, just
get their conversation going.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.556
And I think what we took
out of this was that--

00:05:59.556 --> 00:06:00.680
I think a couple of things.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.810
The first is that students often
are very vocal about feedback,

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.910
but sometimes that feedback
may not be directed

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.560
at the quality of teaching.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.365
And actually, I
personally-- and there

00:06:10.365 --> 00:06:12.031
were students in the
class who disagreed

00:06:12.031 --> 00:06:14.050
with a lot of the
majority voice, which

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.306
was that this professor had
no idea what he was doing,

00:06:16.306 --> 00:06:17.680
he was doing
everything wrong, it

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.340
wasn't supposed to be this way,
he wasn't teaching correctly.

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.580
Cold calling, according to
many of my peers and friends,

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.570
was a dangerous or unsafe
tactic in the classroom.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:30.290
And there was a
lot of unhappiness

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.140
with the way he
taught the class.

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:34.905
It was also markedly more
difficult then years before

00:06:34.905 --> 00:06:37.600
and I think that was also
another contributing factor.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.950
And I think a lot of students
voiced disagreement with this.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:44.590
They went to the
preceptor who's one

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:46.870
of the support members of
the course who develops

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.220
most of the curriculum.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.475
And halfway through
the course-- actually

00:06:50.475 --> 00:06:52.600
it was less than half way,
about a third of the way

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.670
through the course,
the professor actually

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:56.890
decided to stop cold
calling, to put a lot

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.600
of the material on slides.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.235
And he was a senior faculty
member in another ivy league

00:07:02.235 --> 00:07:04.360
school so he'd been doing
this for many, many years

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.220
at that school-- he
was on sabbatical.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.010
And it just, I think--

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:11.320
personally I felt
that that was I guess,

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.690
a misuse, or at least
I thought it was--

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.874
the outcome was not
necessarily something

00:07:15.874 --> 00:07:18.040
positive because I think
his teaching methods forced

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.790
students to learn in a way
that was not necessarily

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.634
what they had done before,
which I think is a good thing.

00:07:24.634 --> 00:07:26.800
I think he-- there was
pretty much consensus that he

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.909
was a good teacher,
but the problem

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:30.700
was that people thought
the course was hard

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.670
and that his teaching
style made it different

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:36.390
or forced people to
learn in a different way.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:39.670
And I think one thing
that I would say--

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:41.170
I guess the conclusion
of the story

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:44.190
is that oftentimes,
especially in places--

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:46.300
Harvard, where students
are very concerned

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.070
about the on-paper outcome of a
course, sometimes the feedback

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.140
whether it's robust
or not can be

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.660
directed at students
satisfaction with the course

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.410
rather than the
quality of teaching.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:59.425
And for a bunch of
20-year-olds who

00:07:59.425 --> 00:08:01.800
are worried about applying to
med school and grad school,

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.930
sometimes it's hard to pull
those distinctions apart.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.840
But I do think that one
of the advantages or one

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:12.340
of the positive outcomes was
that there was a very robust

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:15.512
conversation about what people
thought and so-- to the point

00:08:15.512 --> 00:08:16.720
where the professor decided--

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.812
made the decision to
switch teaching styles.

00:08:18.812 --> 00:08:20.770
So at least I think that
conversation was there

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.420
and people were aware.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.020
Whether or not that was a smart
choice is a separate question,

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:31.320
but I think at least there
was that particular dialogue.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.570
Oh, that's so rich, we have
to be a little Q&amp;A right now.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:37.890
We can't just go
through all the panel.

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:39.280
I know I have a
lot of questions.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.142
Any questions?

00:08:40.142 --> 00:08:40.850
Thank you, Chris.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:42.980
Any questions for Chris, for me?

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:45.500
We'll have more opportunity.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.630
You mentioned that you
though he was a good teacher

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.030
so that suggests to me--
and I'm trying to understand

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.500
what that means to you.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.830
As a learner it sounds
like though it was harder,

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:58.820
you felt like you were learning
more with his techniques

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:01.664
then you had been with
just having it spoon fed.

00:09:01.664 --> 00:09:02.330
Is that correct?

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:02.830
Right.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:03.590
Yeah.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.170
The previous versions of
the course would be where

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.910
the professor-- the instructor
would have slides where there

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.460
were the--

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:12.440
this was a biochemistry course--

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.947
where there would
be the mechanisms

00:09:13.947 --> 00:09:16.280
for the chemical reactions
and everything would be there

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.040
and then the problem
sets and exams

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.770
would just be different
modules within applications.

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:27.410
And for him, the way he taught
it was very much through--

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.209
kind of a socratic
method actually.

00:09:29.209 --> 00:09:30.750
You know, what
happens if we do this?

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.979
What if we add this here?

00:09:31.979 --> 00:09:33.770
What if I do this
different transformation?

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.930
Why is it-- why is this working?

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.770
Why are these mechanisms
attracting this way?

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.760
I thought it actually
forced you to understand

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.700
the intuition of the
principles behind what

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:46.400
was going on the chalkboard,
which is why I think actually

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.966
that tool is useful.

00:09:47.966 --> 00:09:49.340
But I think for
a lot of students

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.490
it was the rapidity at
which he wrote on the board.

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.840
Not having-- you had to
actually take notes, which--

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:59.570
it was really funny because we
have these mid-term evaluations

00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.270
and some students--
he actually--

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.020
I guess this goes to
some of the questions

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.550
we'll probably talk
about later, but he--

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:07.010
at Harvard, for
those courses, you

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.800
fill out an on-paper
evaluation from the instructor

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.610
about halfway
through the course.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:14.690
And so he actually
decided to take

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:16.960
this in a very and advacet--

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.410
what's the word about legal--

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:20.490
not combative.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:21.500
Adversary.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.310
Yeah.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:23.930
And he actually put--

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.013
that day after the
evaluations came out,

00:10:26.013 --> 00:10:28.490
he had entire PowerPoint
slide deck with quotes

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:29.830
from the evaluation.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.985
And he basically would go
through and explain why--

00:10:31.985 --> 00:10:34.610
there would be criticisms like,
we should not be forced to take

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:36.360
notes in this class
because it forces--

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.526
which I think is absolutely
ridiculous for a student

00:10:38.526 --> 00:10:39.500
to say.

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.067
And he would explain why I
think it's important for you

00:10:42.067 --> 00:10:42.650
to take notes.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:45.230
And he actually had-- as a
scientist he had evidence

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:46.525
and he pulled out publications.

00:10:46.525 --> 00:10:48.950
He was like, students
learn 32% better

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:50.560
when they write
down things by hand

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.220
rather than just seeing slides.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:54.080
He went through all
of these comments

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:56.850
and basically defended
his decisions.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:00.437
And then the decisions
that he decided to change--

00:11:00.437 --> 00:11:02.270
for example, someone
wrote that cold calling

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.500
was a very unhealthy tactic.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:08.490
He said, I can see that point,
I won't do that anymore.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.670
Do you think his
transparency there

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.150
was persuasive for your
colleagues in the class?

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.906
You know, when he
said, this is--

00:11:16.906 --> 00:11:19.140
learning is hard and--

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:20.910
I can imagine he
may have said that.

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:21.410
Right?

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.050
I want you to take notes, you
need to generate knowledge

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.920
on your own.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.920
Was that persuasive?

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.810
Did that bring more of your
colleagues along to his style?

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:33.352
I think it was very
important in explaining.

00:11:33.352 --> 00:11:35.810
I think a lot of students came
away from that understanding

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:37.400
why he did things
the way he did.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.080
I don't think it necessarily
convinced them or brought them

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.050
to his side.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.670
I think even at the end of
the course-- and you know,

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:46.250
this is--

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:47.350
this was two years ago.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:51.182
But I think it was a very
polarizing kind of cost

00:11:51.182 --> 00:11:52.640
in the sense of
there were students

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.690
who absolutely loved him.

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.790
And he has a group of students
who stay in touch with him

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:57.650
and he comes back to
Harvard every semester

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.517
and we do journal
clubs with him.

00:11:59.517 --> 00:12:01.100
And so there were
students who thought

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.020
he was one the best
science instructors ever

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:04.090
and then there are--

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:06.560
I'd say maybe 2/3
of students thought

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.250
he was a good
instructor, but the class

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:12.560
was something that they
absolutely despised

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.397
because of various reasons.

00:12:16.397 --> 00:12:18.230
I think people understood
what he was doing,

00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:19.805
I think he made that clear.

00:12:19.805 --> 00:12:22.700
But I don't think necessarily
people all came on board

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.170
or agreed.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.420
Maybe we'll take one more
question right now for Chris

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.740
and then we'll come
back at the end.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:28.240
Yes.

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:33.770
When-- with the
fact that he decided

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:36.660
to change his style
midway through,

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.610
was there a discussion
among the students

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:44.560
about what that said about
the power of the students?

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.130
And how did the students seem
to feel about that power,

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:50.610
if that ever came up in
a discussion afterwards?

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:51.550
Right.

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.332
I think people realize--

00:12:54.332 --> 00:12:56.790
I think for him it was a little
bit different because a lot

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:00.700
of faculty members, they
teach consistently and so

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.434
if a course goes
poorly one semester

00:13:02.434 --> 00:13:04.350
then that reflects on
next year down the line.

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:06.340
But he was here for one
semester and that was it.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:08.798
I don't think-- I think he had
a different type of pressure

00:13:08.798 --> 00:13:11.090
in terms of having
to cater to the pop--

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.322
worrying about popularity
and where my Q scores will

00:13:13.322 --> 00:13:15.440
be seen as gone after this.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:18.640
I think the power dynamic
came more from the preceptor.

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.530
The preceptor for this
course was someone

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.117
who was immensely popular.

00:13:22.117 --> 00:13:24.700
I don't think there was a single
student who didn't absolutely

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.200
love her.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.400
And she was a good instructor.

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.150
She also was part of the
first semester of the course.

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.420
And I think students felt
very comfortable going to her.

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.350
She was also a younger
faculty member,

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:41.290
definitely more able to speak
to students about what they were

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.110
feeling versus he was a very--
he was in a little bit more

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:45.390
senior--

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:48.430
older-- just a little
bit in terms of age

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:50.840
farther removed from
college students.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.620
And I think what happened
was all of the feedback

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:56.050
was channeled through
the preceptor who then I

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:58.750
think ultimately there
had to be a conversation

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.380
between the teaching staff,
her, and the professor,

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.970
and they made those decisions.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:08.950
And I think maybe that speaks
more toward the importance

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:10.650
of having different
voices on a teaching

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.320
team as opposed to
the traditional,

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.731
there's one professor
and that's it,

00:14:14.731 --> 00:14:16.480
especially with large
Harvard courses when

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.563
they are teaching fellows.

00:14:17.563 --> 00:14:21.040
There's preceptors, sometimes
there's a head teaching fellow.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.620
Those parts of the system
often work together

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.320
and communicate things
to them, push a course

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.880
in a different direction.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.340
Thanks.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.120
Thank you, Chris.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.870
Brandon, want to
introduce yourself to us?

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:33.910
Sure.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:34.750
Hi, everyone.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:35.950
I'm Brandon.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:39.310
I'm a third year PhD student
in Biomedical Sciences,

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.340
currently based over
at the Longwood campus.

00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:44.120
I originally did my
undergrad in Toronto

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.780
before coming here
for grad school.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:49.300
And while I've been
a teaching assistant

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.970
for some graduate school
courses in my program,

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:56.350
I thought the most
insightful events

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:57.760
I could share
about my experience

00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.277
so far with the
teacher-student relationship

00:15:01.277 --> 00:15:02.860
and how to evaluate
that, would really

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:06.460
be in the context of
working in a professor's lab

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.330
and doing your thesis work
with a specific supervisor.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:15.970
The way our program works is
for the first one to two years,

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:18.700
most students finish
their required courses

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:20.290
and at the end of
their first year

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:24.130
they select a thesis lab in
which to do their thesis work

00:15:24.130 --> 00:15:27.730
and their thesis research.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.070
Over the course of my
undergraduate and graduate

00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:36.400
studies I've come to know maybe
between five and six professors

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.200
on a scientific
and personal level

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.270
as I transited
through their lives.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:44.020
And I've had an
experience to feel out

00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:47.650
how different programs
and different scientists

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.330
actually like to
be given feedback

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:53.110
and like to hear how their
mentorship style is working.

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:55.730
And I have to say, in
the majority of cases

00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:57.520
it's been that
there's no feedback

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.740
and there's no
evaluation solicited,

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.920
and you have to be the
one to give it forward.

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:06.190
In my undergrad, I worked
in three different labs

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:10.240
and essentially the
PI or the professor

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.210
who was supervising
the lab would not ever

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.730
ask for any feedback.

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:19.870
And it's a relationship where
you are a student in their lab

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:23.110
and you are studying
under them, but it's

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:24.500
a one way relationship.

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:28.060
And while the PI may be
comfortable with receiving

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.860
feedback from you,
you have to be the one

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:30.970
to initiate that process.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:35.590
And there is no formalized
method for delivering feedback

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.210
to a professor.

00:16:37.210 --> 00:16:38.970
And when I've come
to Harvard, I've

00:16:38.970 --> 00:16:42.190
had a couple of different
experiences with this.

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:46.030
I spent a short time
in a relatively new lab

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:49.566
as part of one of my rotations
while I was selecting a thesis

00:16:49.566 --> 00:16:51.150
lab to work in.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.740
And she actually sat me down
at the end of my rotation

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:57.460
and she asked how I felt
about her mentorship style

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.530
and how she was running her lab.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:04.000
And I felt really gratified
to actually have a chance

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.119
to be asked for my feedback
instead of having to actually

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:08.980
take that step and
walk into their office

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:11.369
and tell them something
I've been concerned about.

00:17:11.369 --> 00:17:17.319
And that actually, I felt was
a really big moment and really

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:19.990
something new that I
hadn't experienced before.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.024
And now that I'm
in a thesis lab,

00:17:22.024 --> 00:17:26.619
I've found myself working
with actually a professor who

00:17:26.619 --> 00:17:28.060
has really--

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:30.820
he has an extremely
open door policy,

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:35.110
he essentially has just said,
be frank with me all the time.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:39.250
Any time I want to go into him
or his office with a concern,

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.380
I know he's there
and ready to listen.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.380
But I also know other
students in situations

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.705
where they aren't comfortable
giving feedback to their PI.

00:17:47.705 --> 00:17:51.650
They receive feedback on their
work, on their work styles,

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.990
on the quality of their
data, et cetera, from the PI,

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.180
but it never really
goes back the other way.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.870
And there's no--
aside from going

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.930
to the administrative office and
asking them to really escalate

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:07.140
your concerns, there's no
formalized and maybe not so

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.870
serious way of giving feedback.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:13.290
Because once you
start that process

00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:16.050
it's pretty rigorous for
everyone involved and usually

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.660
doesn't have a good outcome
for the relationship

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.300
of the student and the PI.

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:24.855
I think there's definitely a lot
of ground for either discussion

00:18:24.855 --> 00:18:27.120
or improvement in that area.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.964
And as I understand,
it was also a topic

00:18:28.964 --> 00:18:30.130
in the keynote this morning.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:37.070
Any burning questions
for Brandon?

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.749
Yeah.

00:18:37.749 --> 00:18:39.540
Just speaking with the
range of the faculty

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.510
that you've had the
experience of working with,

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:44.340
was there any observation of
a generational difference?

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:44.840
Absolutely.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.173
In terms of the people who
were willing to take feedback

00:18:47.173 --> 00:18:49.260
and looking for it and
people who weren't?

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.072
Yes, absolutely.

00:18:51.072 --> 00:18:52.530
I would say the
ones that have been

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:55.680
most receptive to
feedback, definitely

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.530
are on the early
end of their career

00:18:57.530 --> 00:19:00.510
or just starting their lab.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.130
I wouldn't say that
older scientists

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:04.260
are less receptive to feedback.

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:08.490
I would say it's more difficult
to actually just give them back

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:11.340
because they tend to
be more established,

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:14.040
they tend to be a
little more distant,

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.990
maybe they're not
in the lab as much

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:18.390
and it's hard to actually
track them down and express

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:19.690
your concerns.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.537
But yeah, that definitely seems
to track with how long you've

00:19:23.537 --> 00:19:24.370
been in science for.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.490
I have one other
question for you.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:34.080
You mentioned this
should be done,

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:38.670
we need to solicit feedback
from mentees for their mentors.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:43.190
And so there-- you could imagine
some kind of anonymous survey,

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:45.590
but that doesn't really get
at the crux of what you're

00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:49.400
talking about, which is this is
a very individual relationship.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.980
And while you've
heard your PI I'd say,

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:55.050
I have an open door, come talk
to me and you've done that.

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:57.500
I can imagine for other
students in the lab,

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.430
they might feel less inclined
to really be open and honest

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:04.430
and say all the things
that are on their mind.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:08.840
I wonder if you have
ideas for how we-- how

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.920
do you encourage this
feedback in the lab setting?

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:17.090
What interventions
could go in to help

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:21.280
every student and their mentor
have these more productive

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.010
feedback conversations?

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:23.520
Right.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.020
Yeah.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.430
That's a great question.

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:29.750
I'm glad you brought up the
point of how to make things

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:33.860
anonymous because in this
kind of relationship I really

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:36.860
don't think you like--
there's no space to make--

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.620
to remove identifying
information because

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:42.950
a PI will typically
have between five and--

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:45.480
I'd say maybe four
or five students.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.340
If they're receiving feedback
it's not really useful to them

00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:50.270
if it's anonymous.

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:53.410
And I think that having specific
information and having--

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:57.800
and actually educating the PI,
that perhaps it's not really

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.100
criticism, but more
suggestions and improvements

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:04.130
for the future, and
changing that mentality

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:06.800
is more important
than saying, oh,

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:11.090
an anonymous student has
said, X, Y, and Z about you.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:13.730
And really the
only formal process

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:18.240
I know right now, that where
students are asked for feedback

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:21.960
on the lab they were in and how
that went is when students are

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.440
at the end of program or
when they've graduated,

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.510
which may not be the
most immediately helpful

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:29.360
to the program, I think.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:35.450
And one idea I have had is
really maybe instituting

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.100
some sort of--

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.950
not so much formal,
but some sort

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:44.850
of set meeting with the
professor and with the student,

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.040
maybe once a semester
or even once a year,

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.910
would be I think more
than frequent enough where

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:54.380
the explicit goal
is not for the PI

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:58.002
to give feedback on the student,
which is typically how meetings

00:21:58.002 --> 00:21:59.710
with a PI and the
student go, but instead

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.130
for it to go the other way.

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:03.560
And for the explicit
goal of these meetings

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.310
to be for the student to express
how they've been experiencing

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:11.060
the lab and how they feel
about mentorship styles

00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:14.350
and so on and so forth.

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:15.498
Thank you.

00:22:15.498 --> 00:22:16.466
Signa?

00:22:16.466 --> 00:22:17.910
Hi, everyone.

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.320
My name is Signa Mahung.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.290
I am a second year at
Harvard Law School.

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:24.370
I also went to Harvard
College for undergrad

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:26.836
and studied Social Studies.

00:22:26.836 --> 00:22:28.335
I actually transferred
here from GW,

00:22:28.335 --> 00:22:31.080
so my perspective is
a little different.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.000
But what I wanted to
talk about with you

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.710
all is actually
something that's happened

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:39.480
since I've been here and less
on the end of giving feedback

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.920
on your teachers performance
or whatnot or the course

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.010
so far as it's been,
but actually having

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:49.740
one of my professors ask at
the very beginning of class

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.500
what our goals and
expectations were for the class

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:56.304
and using that to form the
curriculum for our class.

00:22:56.304 --> 00:22:57.720
It's actually a
visiting professor

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.050
here who is teaching a class on
Black Lives Matter In The Law,

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.210
and for a bunch
of us we're really

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:04.810
excited to take this class.

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:06.560
It's a smaller
class, to one credit

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.910
as opposed to a three
or four credit class.

00:23:08.910 --> 00:23:11.694
And we didn't get the
syllabus beforehand

00:23:11.694 --> 00:23:13.110
and I think for a
bunch of us that

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:16.110
was really scary trying to
figure out what that meant

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:18.480
and how much
reading it would be.

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.240
And when we got into our first
day we had some background

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.090
readings given to us and
he actually sat us down--

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.100
and our class is about
16 people maybe--

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:30.330
and he asked us to
describe ourselves,

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:33.160
tell us about our experiences
and where we're coming from

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.180
and what motivated
us to take the class,

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:40.735
as well as to say what you
wanted to get out of it, what

00:23:40.735 --> 00:23:42.955
we were hoping for
out of the readings

00:23:42.955 --> 00:23:44.850
and out of the discussions.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:48.390
Which I tend to be
someone who doesn't like--

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:50.490
I didn't think about
that beforehand as much

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:52.980
as I probably should have.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:55.890
But we all went around and
engaged in conversation

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:58.450
with one another
about our backgrounds.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:01.860
And I think for me that was a--
it was just a great experience

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:05.760
to hear not only from our
professor and his background,

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.260
but then hear from
other classmates

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.287
and understand the perspective
they were coming from,

00:24:10.287 --> 00:24:12.120
and what they were
looking to get out of it,

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.869
and see how much that
matched up with what

00:24:13.869 --> 00:24:16.290
I was looking for, and
seeing that perspective

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:18.510
and understanding.

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.390
From the very first
class, that we all

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:23.910
have different perspectives,
we all have different goals,

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:27.920
and how do we help each
other to reach those.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:33.750
And so for me that was a very,
welcome to HLS kind of moment.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:37.290
And I'm really excited to
see how this semester goes

00:24:37.290 --> 00:24:40.440
and how our conversations
in the smaller group

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.060
feed into that
narrative and are--

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:45.900
our syllabus has now
been formed so we

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.590
know what's happening
throughout this semester.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.870
But it does seem-- and
even in our conversation

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.212
within the first
meeting of the class,

00:24:54.212 --> 00:24:56.170
you could tell that he
was asking us and trying

00:24:56.170 --> 00:24:57.810
to pull from our
different perspectives

00:24:57.810 --> 00:24:59.960
and directing questions
at certain people who

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.910
might have certain
experiences and then directing

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:03.870
others at others.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:09.465
Any questions for Signa?

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:17.422
I would love to do
that myself, is--

00:25:17.422 --> 00:25:18.130
to leave it open.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:23.700
But I wondered was this
invitation covering

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:26.190
the material and the
kinds of questions,

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:27.600
the contents, so to speak?

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:32.220
Or did it also incorporate,
how should I evaluate you?

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:35.840
How do we define whether
we've learned anything?

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.660
Was that also open
for discussion?

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.080
Or was it really just content?

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.830
And maybe this is
different because you're

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:42.790
in a law school than
an undergraduate,

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:45.540
but you can imagine at
the undergraduate level

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.740
at some point some things
are not negotiable or open.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.520
How did it work in that class?

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:52.950
Because this is
one credit class--

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:54.616
it's called a reading
group and it tends

00:25:54.616 --> 00:25:56.280
to be credit fail
so professors have

00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:00.280
a very open
experience with that,

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.060
they can pretty much
do whatever they want.

00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:05.277
The conversation
definitely was more of,

00:26:05.277 --> 00:26:06.360
what are you looking for--

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.780
less in how he would be
evaluating us, but more

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:11.950
on how he structures
our reading the content,

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:13.570
making sure that for--

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:18.710
this wasn't necessarily like
a waste of time class for us.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:21.160
He wanted it to be
specific to what

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:25.650
we needed out of it, what we
were trying to get out of it.

00:26:25.650 --> 00:26:27.120
Thank you.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.600
Disha?

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.220
Hi, everybody.

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:29.920
I'm Disha.

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:32.540
I am an undergraduate at
Harvard College studying

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.970
Chemical and Physical Biology.

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:37.780
I'm a junior with a secondary
in Computer Science.

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.220
And I've taken a
bunch of classes

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.350
in the Humanities,
some in Engineering

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:45.190
so I can really speak to a
pretty broad, diverse array

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:48.790
of what Harvard
College has to offer.

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:51.040
On campus here, I'm also
a course facilitator

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.124
for Internal Life Sciences
and I am a peer advisor

00:26:53.124 --> 00:26:55.498
for the incoming freshmen so
I've talked to a lot of them

00:26:55.498 --> 00:26:57.510
about their experiences
choosing courses.

00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:59.362
And I also teach
dance and poetry

00:26:59.362 --> 00:27:00.820
to Cambridge Middle
School children

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:05.035
so I understand how hard the
teaching side of it is as well.

00:27:05.035 --> 00:27:07.660
I would just like to start with
an anecdote that's a little bit

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:08.451
similar to Chris's.

00:27:08.451 --> 00:27:12.940
It's about a large Life
Science course here on campus

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.310
and my experience with
the mid-year evaluation

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:19.080
and the students
experience as a whole.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.000
This course is pretty
required for a lot

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.090
of students pursuing both
biology and chemistry,

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:26.530
but also pre-med.

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.260
It was taught this year--

00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:31.830
that I was taking it by a new
faculty member who was young,

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:33.360
still establishing
himself, still

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.400
learning the ropes of
how to teach at Harvard.

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.100
And there were mixed reviews
of his teaching style

00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:40.740
early on in the class.

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.020
There are a lot of
people who were wanting

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.720
to be able to ask more questions
during the lecture, which

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.850
considering it's a very
large lecture style class,

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:49.530
it's pretty difficult
to take questions

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.510
within just the one
hour that the professor

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:52.720
has for instruction.

00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.690
So it's understandable.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:57.100
But there was a lot
of feedback and push

00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.980
during the mid-year
evaluation time

00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:01.080
for him to be able to
take more questions,

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.820
for the lecture slides to
be printed on larger papers

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.120
because we had all these
chemical reactions that should

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.090
probably have been printed
on one slide instead

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:09.990
of two slides per page.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:13.020
For him to hold more
frequent office hours.

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:16.540
Basically the way he approached
this was very upfront.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:19.030
I talked to the
preceptor of the course

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:21.242
later on person-to-person
and office hours.

00:28:21.242 --> 00:28:23.700
And she basically told me that
he had gone through and read

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:26.096
every single one of
the 300 evaluations

00:28:26.096 --> 00:28:27.720
that every single
student had submitted

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.904
during the mid-year
evaluation period.

00:28:29.904 --> 00:28:31.320
And he took those
quite personally

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.926
sometimes because they
were quite hard to read.

00:28:33.926 --> 00:28:35.550
It was his first year
teaching so there

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:38.280
was a lot of pretty
candid feedback.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:41.430
But he went through and
then personally addressed

00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:43.015
the entire class
in a lecture that

00:28:43.015 --> 00:28:44.640
actually happened on
my birthday, which

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.250
is around the mid-year time.

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:50.310
With the feedback that basically
he had gotten and said,

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:53.360
these are the things that I
am going to do differently.

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.319
I am going to take more
questions during class.

00:28:55.319 --> 00:28:57.526
The slides are going to be
printed in this new format

00:28:57.526 --> 00:28:59.940
so it's easier for you guys
to handle them and understand

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:00.780
them.

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.330
This is how office hours
are going to work now.

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:07.230
Basically he stood there and
addressed every single one

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:09.900
of our concerns in person.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.540
And it was very validating
to hear that a professor

00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:14.107
for this very large class--

00:29:14.107 --> 00:29:15.690
professor on tenure
track who was just

00:29:15.690 --> 00:29:19.290
getting used to style
of teaching at Harvard

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.830
was willing to hear
what we had to say,

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.780
and was willing to hear
the sort of evaluations

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:28.530
that we had for him, and really
took the time to critically

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:30.210
read everything that we said.

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:31.980
That being said,
I do think that--

00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.260
echoing something that
Chris said earlier, not

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:38.160
all the student evaluations that
I believe that courses receive

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.480
are always in the best interest
of the students' learning,

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.540
in a sense.

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:46.590
I've also taken a class in the
humanities that is primarily

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:49.630
for freshmen and the
course is very challenging.

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:52.830
We read Joyce's
Ulysses in three weeks.

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:58.350
And we read Plato and
Macbeth and all these books,

00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:59.310
like once--

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:01.110
like one book per
week basically.

00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:03.450
It's a time-intensive
reading, intensive class.

00:30:03.450 --> 00:30:05.970
And I think my year
was the second year

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:07.110
that it was being run.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:09.810
And the year afterward it was
significantly easier I believe.

00:30:09.810 --> 00:30:12.470
The workload was easier,
the final was easier.

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:14.890
And because of that I
think the course actually

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:17.190
became less rich for the
students who were involved

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.260
because the faculty
had decided to take

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:22.020
into account the evaluations
that were asking for the class

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:25.060
to be less time and less
of a stressful burden

00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:27.310
on the students
come finals period.

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:30.250
But I really think that I got a
lot more out of the course when

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:31.590
it was more challenging.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:35.070
I think in a sense,
students do have the power

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:37.300
to shape a lot about
how the course works,

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.500
but like Chris was saying
earlier, sometimes we

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.620
do worry a little bit too
much about the time constraint

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.110
or what it will do
towards GPA or the fact

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:49.080
that it's just a requirement
for our concentration.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.550
I think it's worth having
those candid conversations

00:30:51.550 --> 00:30:54.230
and keeping that in mind
with the evaluations.

00:30:57.760 --> 00:30:58.890
Thanks, Disha.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:02.950
You mentioned for
today that you really

00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:06.780
value the Q Guide
as a student and yet

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.280
you just talked about
this discrepancy that

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:14.040
could exist between the
popularity of the professor

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:17.700
and maybe even how good he
or she-- how charismatic

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:21.630
he is in front of a classroom
with what you actually learn

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.840
in the class and that
those two may not always

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.370
correlate highly.

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:28.500
I wonder what it is
from the student side

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.920
that you value in the Q. What
do you look for when you are

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:36.497
shopping a course and
deciding, does this

00:31:36.497 --> 00:31:38.080
look like something
I'm interested in?

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.817
What are you looking for in
this other students feedback?

00:31:41.817 --> 00:31:43.650
I think the Q is
absolutely something that's

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:45.670
pretty critical for a
lot of students because--

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:47.253
especially freshmen,
they don't always

00:31:47.253 --> 00:31:49.080
have a whole lot
of places to learn

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:51.454
about what a class is like
before they go into a shopping

00:31:51.454 --> 00:31:52.870
week.

00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:55.570
That being said, I do take the
Q Guide with a grain of salt

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:58.500
sometimes because the
evaluations that students give

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.450
are anatomised
and you don't know

00:32:00.450 --> 00:32:04.950
exactly the background of some
students going into the class.

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:07.410
Say for example, I came from
a very strong life sciences

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:08.780
background in high school.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.074
I've taken-- I took organic
chemistry in high school

00:32:11.074 --> 00:32:12.740
and because of that,
my experience going

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:14.850
into organic chemistry
in freshman year

00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:16.600
was very different
from some of the things

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.390
that the Q Guide was
saying, which was like,

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:20.340
oh, this class is awful, it's
going to wreck your life,

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.890
it's going to be
way too difficult

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:24.500
for you to take as a freshman.

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:27.210
It's just something
to keep in mind.

00:32:27.210 --> 00:32:29.590
And I do think that
there are classes that

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:33.936
will be rated highly that are--

00:32:33.936 --> 00:32:36.300
that I think potentially are
rated highly just because

00:32:36.300 --> 00:32:40.749
of the personality of the
professor or because of--

00:32:40.749 --> 00:32:42.790
for example, there's one
particular science class

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.330
that normally gets really
pretty high Q scores,

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:47.790
but gets that because the
professor is really funny, not

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:50.670
necessarily because the class
is particularly well taught,

00:32:50.670 --> 00:32:53.910
it's just because her
lectures are enjoyable.

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:55.770
When I look at the Q
Guide as a student,

00:32:55.770 --> 00:33:00.360
I really value to find out the
Q shows the amount of hours that

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.250
go into the class per week.

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:04.220
Because as busy
students, everyone

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:06.950
wants to know how to budget
their time on average.

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:09.270
And I also really value what
the students individually

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.400
have to say.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.050
I think faculty
sometimes get asked

00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:14.710
like is the Q even useful?

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:16.929
They wonder whether the
students even use it.

00:33:16.929 --> 00:33:17.970
I think it's very useful.

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:23.020
I think I have not really seen
any courses that don't release

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:24.830
Q scores, but when
they don't it makes

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:27.330
me wonder what is there about
the course that I should know?

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:29.790
What is it that
the faculty doesn't

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:31.156
want me to see basically?

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:34.934
Umm so yeah.

00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:42.420
I have a question for Signa
kind of informed by the comment

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:44.130
that Disha just made.

00:33:44.130 --> 00:33:46.250
I've never taken
a law class and so

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:50.020
I don't know what your standard
is for giving evaluation

00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:50.540
feedbacks.

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:53.046
And nothing just about Harvard
and the experience so far,

00:33:53.046 --> 00:33:55.670
when you think back about any of
the work that you did earlier,

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:58.390
how do you actually
give feedback?

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:00.330
Is it just the end
of the semester?

00:34:00.330 --> 00:34:03.255
Eval, and then how do you
know if faculty factor that in

00:34:03.255 --> 00:34:06.400
or keep them accountable to it.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.090
The law school
model is typically--

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:09.389
you get feedback at the end.

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:13.820
It's something like a
Q Guide system where--

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.050
for GW for instance,
you would rank

00:34:16.050 --> 00:34:20.389
the hours, the effectiveness
of the lectures,

00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:24.810
teachers knowledge of the
course, student engagement

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:25.790
participation.

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:29.710
And then you had a box where you
could give individual comments

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:32.449
and feedbacks either to the
teacher and then just students

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:35.360
who are considering the class.

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:38.480
The second-- that tends to
be pretty much everywhere.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:41.810
I will say, one thing I was
so shocked about Harvard Law

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:43.909
is that apparently
it's not online.

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:45.949
I think they're moving
towards that direction,

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:49.100
but I will say, choosing
classes for the semester was

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.590
terrible trying to
figure out what to take.

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:55.230
What do I know about
these professors?

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:57.620
Some of it-- they have
some of it online,

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:01.240
but ultimately it's just
not all together in a space

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.910
that I think it
really should be.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:06.260
But basically trying--

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.460
I use it a lot.

00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.479
I use that feedback, especially
the individual comments at GW

00:35:11.479 --> 00:35:13.520
based on what students
have said about the class.

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.370
If they say, if you--

00:35:16.370 --> 00:35:19.370
government contracts-- if
you have a broad interest

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:21.770
in this person's
a person for you

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:23.764
if you want something
that's more in depth

00:35:23.764 --> 00:35:25.680
or specific or you know
that this is something

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.420
that you want to do, go
with a different professor.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:34.140
Hearing that feedback and then
figuring it out is so helpful.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.440
But in terms of
teacher-- the feedback

00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:39.449
that teachers get and professors
get from those evaluations,

00:35:39.449 --> 00:35:41.240
we have no idea whether
or not they take it

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.290
into consideration.

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:44.404
And I will say something
for me as a student--

00:35:44.404 --> 00:35:46.070
and I think a lot of
my other classmates

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:50.120
think this is well, is it that
the tenure system sort of--

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.590
you write an
evaluation, especially

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:56.832
for your 1L doctrinal
classes where you say,

00:35:56.832 --> 00:35:58.790
I didn't understand a
thing that this professor

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:00.800
was saying to me all semester.

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:03.540
I went to office hours,
he was grouchy and mean

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:06.100
and didn't help,
and I left the class

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:09.300
just being like, I
couldn't do this subject.

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:11.160
And then you know
nothing changes

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.510
because they've said
in the past, whatever,

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:17.870
you guys write whatever you
want in our course evals.

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:22.107
And there's no driving force for
them to change their curriculum

00:36:22.107 --> 00:36:25.460
or change their teaching
methodology, which

00:36:25.460 --> 00:36:27.830
is something that's
frustrating on a student.

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:29.570
And especially when--

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:31.239
I would say for
the first year you

00:36:31.239 --> 00:36:33.280
don't get a choice in the
teachers and professors

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.400
that you get, your
placed into a class.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.870
And you have to figure out
what that professors system is

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:42.800
and go with it, and
it's on you to do that.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:45.170
And so when you get to
the end of the course,

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:46.940
a lot of the time
it comes down to you

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:48.842
ranting about all
of the injustices

00:36:48.842 --> 00:36:51.300
that you feel like you went
through throughout the semester

00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:53.279
and not necessarily
thinking that it's actually

00:36:53.279 --> 00:36:55.820
going to have any effect on the
people who are going to come.

00:36:58.460 --> 00:36:59.660
Thank you.

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:02.464
Thank you all for all
of your presentations.

00:37:02.464 --> 00:37:04.130
One thing I was hearing
across the board

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:08.590
was just how important or
how positive of an experience

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:10.210
it was for you to
feel recognized,

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:13.200
feel like your voices mattered.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:17.630
I'm coming as a French
professor so the opposite of--

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:19.340
I don't do lectures.

00:37:19.340 --> 00:37:23.270
I'm teaching a seminar,
that means once a week.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:31.020
In terms of what
format to choose,

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:35.090
or what format what might
work in making students

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:37.550
feel like their voices
have been heard,

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:40.370
I hesitate to devote one--

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:42.380
the semester's not
very long, it's

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:45.185
only about 12 teachable weeks
because the first week you

00:37:45.185 --> 00:37:47.300
can't really do
anything with shopping.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:50.570
And I hesitate to
take class time out,

00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:54.860
which I don't have that much
of to go over the evaluations

00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:59.480
because that means we're reading
one last novel that semester.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:06.040
Can you think of alternatives
to taking class time away

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:12.961
to go over student feedback
that might still make you feel

00:38:12.961 --> 00:38:14.949
recognized and listened to?

00:38:19.919 --> 00:38:23.270
I think students do
read their emails

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:27.290
and do respond to office hours.

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:29.360
I think if there
were opportunities

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:31.750
to go talk to you in office
hours about feedback,

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:33.240
that might also be an option.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:35.240
I don't necessarily
think that it

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.610
need to in lecture
or in your seminar

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:40.204
because I do understand that
seminars are very limited time

00:38:40.204 --> 00:38:42.370
and what students value at
seminars is the learning,

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:46.501
not necessarily talking about
the feedback of the learning.

00:38:46.501 --> 00:38:47.000
So

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.166
I think an email communication
is also totally fine.

00:38:49.166 --> 00:38:52.190
I've had professors who've
done that in the past.

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:54.000
And we do read that
because obviously,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.833
when your professor is
sending you something

00:38:55.833 --> 00:38:58.480
you should probably
check that it is.

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:02.710
And maybe, I don't know, like
candid office hours may also

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:06.830
be an option, office hours
themed around the feedback.

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:09.280
I would second that,
particularly with office hours.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.100
I've had professors
who after I ask

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.285
a question will ask how
do I feel about the class,

00:39:14.285 --> 00:39:17.260
how do I feel like it's
going, and that opens up

00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:18.290
the conversation.

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:19.920
And there are
definitely professors

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:23.330
where I know to be sort of
more, no, everything-- you know,

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:24.630
everything's fine.

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:26.091
Ultimately, more positive.

00:39:26.091 --> 00:39:27.507
And there are other
professors who

00:39:27.507 --> 00:39:29.090
I know are really
looking for the more

00:39:29.090 --> 00:39:30.670
constructive criticism.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:33.640
But having the opportunity
and having a professor prompt

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.200
you to give that in a
more one-on-one setting

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.210
makes it feel like
you're actually

00:39:38.210 --> 00:39:41.200
having your voice heard.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.240
Maybe a companion
question that--

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:44.890
and I know a couple
of you mentioned

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:47.200
that you've also
taught and so you've

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:51.410
been on the other side of
this system of evaluations.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:59.140
And so have you ever as
a teacher, as a student,

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:02.722
have you been given a
mid-course evaluation?

00:40:02.722 --> 00:40:04.810
So from the student
side where it really

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:07.270
didn't ask something
about something

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:09.730
that you cared deeply about?

00:40:09.730 --> 00:40:12.370
And did that-- how did
that make you feel?

00:40:12.370 --> 00:40:14.210
Were you frustrated by that?

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:16.120
And then on the other--
and as a student

00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.940
did you ever answer
something on a mid-course

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:21.250
and not see it
addressed in the class

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:24.220
and what did you
feel about that?

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:28.110
And then from the
teacher side of things,

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:32.730
can you think about
why that might happen?

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:37.760
That disconnect of that either
you don't get asked something

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:41.670
or that you don't have
an opportunity to--

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:44.980
that you don't hear that your
feedback was really addressed?

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:50.400
I've been-- I don't--

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.060
we don't have mid-year
for PCMP, right?

00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:53.881
We didn't do that.

00:40:54.380 --> 00:41:01.990
OK, yeah, so I don't have a
specific answer to the question

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:03.290
of mid-year evaluations.

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:06.080
But I've been both
a student and a TA

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:09.120
for the second year
this time around.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.230
In the first year
molecular biology

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:13.780
graduate course for my program.

00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:16.750
I've seen the exact same
course for three years

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:21.820
now from both sides
and I think something

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:24.750
that the students sometimes--

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:27.730
when I was a student and
hearing feedback from students

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:31.150
in my section that I lead at
discussion section every two

00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:34.720
weeks, is that
sometimes students

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:39.550
fail to really see the
reality of running a course.

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:43.472
And sometimes just during
informal, maybe halfway

00:41:43.472 --> 00:41:45.430
through the semester,
I'll check in with people

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:47.700
and see how my
students are doing.

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:51.010
They'll bring up
points such as say,

00:41:51.010 --> 00:41:52.690
changing the format
of problem sets

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:54.262
or changing the way
things are graded

00:41:54.262 --> 00:41:55.720
or the weighting
of the grades that

00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:59.080
really aren't things
that can be changed

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:01.539
in the middle of a course.

00:42:01.539 --> 00:42:03.080
And while they might
be valid points,

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:07.690
I feel like sometimes
a mid-course evaluation

00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:11.380
is going to solicit
comments that

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:15.300
are not necessarily helpful
to that year of the course.

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:18.289
And it might be more helpful--

00:42:18.289 --> 00:42:19.830
and those mid-year
comments are going

00:42:19.830 --> 00:42:23.490
to be more helpful really
for reminding students

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:26.890
and collecting their thoughts
while their thoughts are still

00:42:26.890 --> 00:42:29.470
fresh on whatever
was being taught

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:31.250
around that mid-year period.

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:34.020
And so by the time you get to
the final course evaluation

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:38.270
they haven't forgotten what
they were experiencing.

00:42:38.270 --> 00:42:39.650
Can I maybe follow up on that?

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:41.410
I think that's a great point.

00:42:41.410 --> 00:42:43.430
A couple of the questions
that you guys did

00:42:43.430 --> 00:42:47.150
a wonderful job writing
to spoke to when

00:42:47.150 --> 00:42:50.020
is the most effective
time to ask for feedback?

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:52.100
And a couple people
suggested continuous.

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:54.450
Should it be a daily
journal that every day

00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:56.700
I go home and say,
this class was awesome,

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.550
or I would have
changed this part?

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:02.150
Or could it even be
fun in that context?

00:43:02.150 --> 00:43:03.650
Could it-- does it
always have to be

00:43:03.650 --> 00:43:08.180
an arduous end of the
year soul searching thing?

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:12.980
Or can it be maybe a more
informal continuous thing?

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:14.688
I just want to open that to you.

00:43:18.432 --> 00:43:19.700
Can I just add to that?

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:22.880
Maybe even after
the course is over,

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:27.245
allow some time to go by
so that you can really

00:43:27.245 --> 00:43:30.920
reflect on what are the
lasting effects of that course.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:36.890
I've had students who have
given a course a fair evaluation

00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:40.865
at the very end, thought
about it over the summer

00:43:40.865 --> 00:43:47.350
and come back and tell me it was
phenomenal because the takeaway

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:49.840
filtered through.

00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:52.460
Those moments, those
high intensity moments

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:55.620
that may have come from
the class at any moment.

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:58.485
In fact, is that
more valuable for you

00:43:58.485 --> 00:44:03.110
to reflect on after
some time has passed

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:08.080
and as you're maybe making
choices for what's the next--

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:11.288
what are the next courses
that I'm going to be taking?

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:18.640
I think I very much echo
exactly what you said.

00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:20.635
I do think there is
some-- like right now

00:44:20.635 --> 00:44:23.350
the Q scores are solicited
right before students

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:24.815
get their grades.

00:44:24.815 --> 00:44:29.010
I do think there is some
logistical difficulties in that

00:44:29.010 --> 00:44:31.570
once a student sees their
grade they may not feel

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:34.230
the same way about the course.

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:36.300
But I do think that
there are definitely

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:37.860
courses that I have
taken here, which

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:40.200
after teaching
subsequent courses,

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.430
I feel so much more grateful
for having to take--

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:44.480
I took MCD060 with Marty.

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.290
And that course, I'm
so grateful for having

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:48.880
taken because the
skills that I use

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:52.320
are now invaluable in higher
level graduate bio courses

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:53.910
that I'm taking.

00:44:53.910 --> 00:44:58.380
I think that in and of
itself is a useful to think

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:01.530
about soliciting
feedback maybe a semester

00:45:01.530 --> 00:45:03.610
after you've taken a
class, after you've

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:06.220
taken more advanced
classes in the same area.

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:08.160
But that being said,
that doesn't necessarily

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:12.331
have to get rid of the Q
scores being collected right

00:45:12.331 --> 00:45:13.830
before the grades
because I do think

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:15.829
that there is some value
to a student reflecting

00:45:15.829 --> 00:45:17.982
on the course before
getting something

00:45:17.982 --> 00:45:19.440
on their transcript
that tells them

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:21.480
how they did in the course.

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.340
Actually, that reminds
me of something

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:26.310
that came up in the panel
this morning, which was

00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:28.410
asking the alumni for feedback.

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:33.770
And so, Signa, I know you are
a Harvard alumnus and so are

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:37.190
there-- if you reflect back on
your undergraduate experience,

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:39.900
are there things that-- are
there courses that you took

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:40.650
that--

00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:44.240
or information you've
retained or skills

00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.390
you've retained from
your undergraduate years

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:48.960
that you now realize like,
oh, I didn't appreciate

00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:53.820
that that same way when I was
going through it as I do now?

00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:55.650
Definitely.

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:57.540
Actually, one of my
classes right now

00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:59.400
tends to be more
politically science focused

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:03.450
and I was a social studies
undergrad major and had

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:06.390
to take this class my sophomore
year called social studies 10,

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:08.970
which everybody knows
is sort of a nightmare

00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:12.630
and it's all social theory and
you just have to get through it

00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:14.750
to get to the good stuff.

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:17.790
And going though this
class now really makes

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:19.950
me think back to
undergrad and thinking,

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:25.190
wow, I wish I had paid more
attention in social studies 10.

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:27.090
And it was just a
really good foundation

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:30.780
for learning how to read
text and sort of pick up

00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:32.520
these ideas and
the main messages

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:36.570
from the authors, which I
thought I knew how to do

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:38.790
and then afterwards I was
like, no, actually now I

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:41.730
know how to do this better.

00:46:41.730 --> 00:46:43.369
And looking back,
there are definitely

00:46:43.369 --> 00:46:45.660
classes that stick out that
I think I didn't appreciate

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:48.525
at the time as much as I should
have and now very much value

00:46:48.525 --> 00:46:49.910
having done.

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:52.560
The same thing, there are
also classes that I thought

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.540
were really interesting
during undergrad

00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:57.030
and had sort of not
really contributed

00:46:57.030 --> 00:47:01.557
much in terms of my
academic development,

00:47:01.557 --> 00:47:02.890
but they were good all the same.

00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:04.300
They're really
interesting, happy

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:09.250
that I took them, but definitely
not as productive or effective.

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:10.890
That adds an
interesting dimension

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:12.840
to this alumni
feedback piece, which

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:18.030
is that's great for all faculty
to know what my students retain

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.930
years out.

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:21.380
But also for students--
perspective students

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:25.070
in that class to hear
from the alumni who's

00:47:25.070 --> 00:47:28.380
in law school saying, you might
think this class is a drag,

00:47:28.380 --> 00:47:31.651
but you're going to really need
it, so pay attention to this.

00:47:31.651 --> 00:47:32.150
OK.

00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:33.340
I know we have a hard stop.

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.620
Everything-- these
were such rich stories

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:39.180
that our plans for
our interaction

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.670
evaporated because
I think we all

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:43.170
felt like we really
wanted to give

00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:45.420
the students the voice in here.

00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:47.810
So we top now.
