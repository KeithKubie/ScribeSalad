00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.960
Let's say that company
ABCD is some type

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.476
of a pharmaceutical company that
has a drug trial coming out.

00:00:06.476 --> 00:00:08.350
And you're convinced--
it's right now trading

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.180
at $50 a share-- but you're
convinced that if the drug gets

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.240
approved, that the company's
stock is going to skyrocket.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.660
And you're also convinced
that if the drug gets

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.970
rejected, that
the stock price is

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.740
going to tank to
maybe $5 or $10.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.639
So if you wanted to make
money off of that belief,

00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:27.680
and I'm not necessarily
recommending that you do.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.260
It's always trickier in reality
than it sounds on paper.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260
But one way that you could
is you could actually

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.340
buy both the call option and
the put option on that stock.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.305
The put option is going to make
you money if the stock tanks.

00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:41.680
And then the call
option is going

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.070
to make money if the
drug gets approved

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.580
and the stock skyrockets.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.330
So let's actually draw
the payoff diagram here.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.670
So if the stock goes down,
let's say it goes down to 0,

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.110
you would exercise
the put option.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.790
Because you could buy
the stock for zero,

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.960
exercise your put option,
and sell it for $50.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.937
This is the right to
sell the stock for $50.

00:01:03.937 --> 00:01:05.770
And of course, we're
talking about the value

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.600
of the combination
now at expiration.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.610
So the stock is worth
zero at expiration,

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.829
the value of the put
option is worth $50.

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:16.370
The call option is
clearly worthless.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.936
You wouldn't exercise
the call option

00:01:17.936 --> 00:01:19.060
if the stock is worth zero.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.190
You would want to buy something
for $50 that's worth 0.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.090
So from the stock's being
worth zero, all the way up

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.060
to the stock being
worth $50, you

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.364
would want to exercise
the put option.

00:01:31.364 --> 00:01:32.780
But the value of
the put option is

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.980
going to become lower
and lower and lower.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.600
And anything above
$50, you wouldn't

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.660
exercise the put option at all.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.580
But if you get
above $50, you would

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.120
want to exercise
your call option.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.450
If the stock is worth
$60 at expiration,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.250
then your call
option is worth $10.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.110
Because you have the
right to buy something

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.660
for $50, which you
can sell for $60.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.280
So then you have the value
of your call option going up.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.630
So you can see a situation here.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.088
When you just think
about the value

00:01:59.088 --> 00:02:02.210
of this bundle of the
call plus the put option.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.170
That it's not much value
if value of the stock

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.830
doesn't change from $50,
your options are worthless.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.590
But if you have a
major movement, either

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.520
to the upside or the
downside, then this straddle,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.020
it's called.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.870
Let me write that down.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.840
When you go long a call
and you go along a put,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.550
this is call a long straddle.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.009
In a long straddle you benefit
from a major price movement.

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:28.175
And when you think about
it from the profit and loss

00:02:28.175 --> 00:02:29.760
point of view, you
just shift it down

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.280
based on the amount you
paid for the two options.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.690
So in this case, we paid
$20 for both options.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.130
So in this situation where
we would exercise the put,

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.480
instead of making
$50, we have to net

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.180
it for the $20 we
paid for the options.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.140
So we would only make $30.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.430
And at the point where we're
not exercising either option,

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.470
because they're both
essentially worthless,

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.150
no reason to exercise
them, then we essentially

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.800
have just lost $20
for both options.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.110
So we will be down over here.

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.540
And then anything above $50,
will start to make money.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.500
So let me draw the
option diagram over here.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.940
It will look like
this, the payoff

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.210
diagram It will
look just like that.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.180
So when you actually
factor in how much you

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.820
paid for the options,
you now see that you only

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.520
would make money
with this straddle

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.090
if the underlying
stock price, maybe

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.810
after the results of
the trial are released,

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.590
hopefully get released
before the maturity

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.525
of the actual options.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.040
If the stock goes below $30,
or if the stock goes above $70.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.140
But if it has one of those
major movements, then

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.630
this position, this
straddle, this long straddle

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.920
will make you money.
