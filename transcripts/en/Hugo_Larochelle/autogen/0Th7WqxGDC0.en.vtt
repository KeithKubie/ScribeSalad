00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.350
 in this capsule we see the notion 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.230
 of inference in the logic of the first 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.030
 round 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:11.309
 so we've already seen how you are 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.460
 what is the syntax of logic 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.890
 first round to describe facts that 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.420
 are true mm teeth in a base of 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.439
 knowledge now let's see the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:24.359
 second part that we need for 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.340
 demonstrate the veracity of a new 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.630
 expression know as attests that 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.810
 can do by manipulations 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.250
 syntactic do a derivation of 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.130
 new expressions that are 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.129
 logical consequences and specifically 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.370
 worth to see the proof by resolution so 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.110
 the rule of resolution that will work 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.950
 which will allow us to do just that 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:51.539
 it's this lot new derivation 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.190
 expressions then validly so 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.760
 general process of inference 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.350
 processes that allow us to infer 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.420
 formulas that are consequences 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.350
 logical other formulas for example 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.870
 they formulate in a database of 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.610
 knowledge there are two properties that 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.710
 will interest us in relation to 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.479
 different processes the first one is 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.610
 what the reference process is 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.670
 correct ie is what the state 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.470
 are all the formulas that go 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.509
 be deduced by the different process 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.670
 these are indeed consequences 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.900
 logics of these formulas so in 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.170
 other words to that one to the process 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.360
 difference is only shores and 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.520
 formulas that are valid that are 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.650
 logical consequences or does this 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.600
 would be the case where a different process 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.759
 would not be correct or samedan English 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.610
 is sometimes a process of inference 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.600
 drifts expressions that are not 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.549
 logical consequences so if we want 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.200
 not if we want precise different what 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.930
 is ok we would also like 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.100
 different process what is 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:54.930
 ideally complete to know that if I 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:56.009
 specify an an expression and that this 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.840
 expression is actually a 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.610
 logical consequence of my base of 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.490
 knowledge though my process 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.020
 different this vote is capable of derivatives 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.369
 this formula so in other words is 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.860
 what my difference process is 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.770
 able to infer any formula that is 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.250
 a logical consequence of good in sum 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.930
 initial basic formulas of anger 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.000
 then one assures us that we are not going 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.170
 derive that is wrong when we assures 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.469
 we can all be derived 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:27.329
 what is true here is an example two 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.909
 examples in fact rules of inference 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:32.430
 very simple the first step the words 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:35.310
 from the spawn end who says that if I 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.439
 formula f1 where the price of co is fine and 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.760
 that I have the formula f1 explains f killer 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:44.040
 so I can deduce f2 added to the 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.930
 first logical expression list 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.500
 rank in my knowledge base so 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:52.230
 among other topics or a little this raid 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.379
 is pure life so it would be 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.109
 the equivalent of f1 here no forgiveness if 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:01.919
 I had a little this live opus implies 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:05.040
 all that would be the fire r2f equivalent 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:08.159
 implies f2 and that i have additionally had a 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:13.739
 this little help is a bit strife 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:15.659
 would be f1 then according to the rule 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.940
 of word inference available on Saturday that I 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:21.150
 can add shu who can infer shoot 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.609
 from these two formulas another 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.000
 is different is the instantiation 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:31.530
 universal that says that from for for 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.989
 all xf1 I can deduce a formula f2 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.930
 which would be obtained from f1 in 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.930
 replacing all occurrences free 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.560
 of my variable x so manage a variable 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.879
 external 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.269
 I replace all occurrences 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:48.299
 free 2 x by internal a theme 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:51.569
 whatever but who does not have any 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.609
 variables in common with others 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:56.009
 variables of f1 so that allows a little 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.689
 more than we want a little complicated but a 

00:03:56.009 --> 00:04:00.180
 very simple example of blood that allows 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:03.840
 to understand what why this 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:06.209
 difference in sense if i have like 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.639
 for all etc so I have that all 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:11.669
 dogs are the same do and then 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:15.000
 if i have that fido is a dog ben i 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:16.650
 can conclude that fido and finally to do 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.039
 so marked that here I had a rule 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:22.380
 which applied to all dogs so 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:25.530
 I if I had fits logical form 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.860
 after rob i will have a variable x here 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:40.950
 his rule looks like something like 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:45.510
 for any x dog x involves granny doing 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:48.710
 so here I am writing you grandma x and fido 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:51.570
 is a dog I could write as 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.770
 dog 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.100
 lemaitre who is it because I had it 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:05:00.000
 put with a sim may not be the 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:04.220
 water well so this rule says that at 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:09.740
 from that and that I can infer 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.740
 fido mammals 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.480
 that's the instantiation rule 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:17.940
 universal what we are going to 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.580
 focus during the next caps 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:25.169
 and on a more general rule that 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.300
 call the resolution rule so that 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.220
 will allow us among others first 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.780
 like what particular rule modus 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:35.130
 pony since universal instantiation 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.419
 dawn it's going to be a procedure so 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.370
 thanks to this rule we will be able to do 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.700
 a proof by resolution that this 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.200
 procedure must be correct and complete 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:46.020
 under certain conditions we will see 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.120
 in the next capsules and it was 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:51.660
 a rule that will require several 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:54.419
 tools that we will discuss in 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.620
 different capsules these tools have it 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:58.380
 correspond to what is called the 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.240
 substitution unification 

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:04.220
 and then finally the transformation 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.220
 in conjunctive normal form
