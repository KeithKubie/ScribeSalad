00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.749
Looking for life on Mars isn’t as simple
as looking for life on Mars.

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:08.790
There are environments to consider, and it
turns out rustier might be better.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.430
Hey guys, Amy with you on DNews today.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.560
Our planet isn’t the same all around.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.910
There are different environments on Earth
that affect the life forms that grow in an

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:20.910
area.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.090
The same goes for Mars; there are different
environments around the planet.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.790
This is a good thing because it means there
are multiple places to be looking for life.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:32.160
But at the same time, it also means astrobiologists
studying the planet need to narrow down what

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.270
makes for a life-harboring environment.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.440
Gale Crater is a good place to start..That’s
NASA’s Curiosity rover’s current stomping

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.050
or properly roving ground.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.110
Not only is there a three-mile high stratified
mountain in the middle of the crater offering

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.010
a look at Mars’ geologic history, the area
shows evidence of past water and atmospheric

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.670
methane, two things that speak to past life.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.039
But this evidence of water and methane isn’t
enough.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.289
The cells that make up any organism need energy
to function, and that energy can’t come

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:59.340
from nowhere.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.120
So the question is where on Mars might those
energy sources be?

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.619
Are there places on Mars where possible organics
could get their energy?

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.350
Green rust might be an answer.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.740
We’re all familiar with rust, that lovely,
orange-reddish, corrosive thing that happens

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.499
to iron metals when left exposed to moisture
and oxygen in the air.

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:20.490
But when there isn’t enough oxygen to fully
oxidize the iron minerals, say, in Mars’

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.609
carbon-dioxide rich atmosphere, the effect
is slower and develops into less complete

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:27.340
form of rust called green rust.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.799
Green rust is uncommon on Earth but not unheard
of.

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.939
It’s been found in water-logged soils, groundwater,
and in 2012 was discovered in the oxygen-free

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.380
water of Lake Matano in Indonesia.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.929
This rare and highly reactive iron mineral
played an important role in ancient oceans.

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.469
Its presence in oceans suggest it was instrumental
in removing nickel from ancient water sources,

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.700
a critical process for some life forms that
use it and the dissolved nutrients it carries

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.920
as a nutrient for producing methane.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.189
And its possible that, on Earth, green rust
exposed to the early atmosphere would have

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.359
done the same thing, helping our planet generate
the oxygen-rich environment that has harbored

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:01.679
life like us.

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.559
So what this means is that these two types
of iron minerals have different redox states

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:09.450
and different numbers of elections, which
could allow the mineral to take in or give

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.780
up electrons to act as a catalyst.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.599
Green rust can absorb and concentrate nutrients,
as well as accept and donate electrons for

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.599
life.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.129
Because Mars’ surface is high oxidized,
it’s possible that green rust exists just

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.370
under the surface, which means we’ll have
to dig to find it.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.299
Some scientists want to try to detect green
rust using Curiosity’s laser, measuring

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.299
the spectroscopy of the scattered light.

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.400
Upcoming missions, namely NASA’s InSIGHT
lander and the European Space Agency’s Exomars

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.540
mission will have the provision to drill into
the surface.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.500
But we also need to learn a little more about
this rare green rust and how it can possibly

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.010
support habitability.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:03:17.739
So are you guys going to look at the rusted
bits on your cars a little differently now?
