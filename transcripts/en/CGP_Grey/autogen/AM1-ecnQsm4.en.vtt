00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.120
"Challenge: can you post another Q&amp;A
 within six months?"

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.060
No. I cannot.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.660
"What are your favorite and least favorite
kinds of questions to answer?"

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.540
A long time ago, in a state far away

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.240
I did an event with some friends where my job
 was to pick questions from the audience.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.860
Right before the show started, pretty Derek turned to me and said, "Please don't pick superlatives."

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.960
And I said, "What's a superlative?"

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.620
"Best, worst, favorite, least favorite"

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.900
"Aaaaah."

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.260
The show begins and those were probably 
half the questions in the bowl.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.580
But Derek, having had much more experience 
with Q&amp;As, was totally right.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.040
On the spot those questions are pretty hard to answer.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.240
But also, as I've grown up I found the whole concept
of a favorite 'X' has become more...

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.240
...abstract, and situational.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.560
Favorite things seem to be more
important the younger you are,

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.360
which makes sense because you don't really know who
you are, and so define yourself by the world around you.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.660
And it's also practice for the tribal affiliation games
we NEVER escape even as adults.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.520
Which can make trying to answer these questions super
unfun when people take the answer

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.120
waaaay too seriously.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.780
So a question about my favorite is by far my least favorite, but Fahrenheit is still my favorite.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.500
Come at me!

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.840
Anyway, if you're ever at a show
or submitting questions to a Q&amp;A,

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.200
to raise the odds of getting an answer, try turning it a bit.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.500
For example: "Whose videos do you watch the most?"

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.440
That's an easy answer. RedLetterMedia by a mile.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.580
I started with the highly produced gateway classics

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.360
and over the years progressed
to mainlining the hardcore stuff.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.580
It's hard to say why I so like watching guys I don't know
view movies and instructional videos ~I never will~

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.260
but it's strangely comforting and engaging.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.440
And let's not talk about how many hundreds
of hours of RedLetterMedia I've had on

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.720
while animating since starting my own channel.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.420
I'm glad YouTube doesn't track and timeshame
unlike some *other* services I could mention.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.720
I also picked this question because

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.100
I can't bear watching RedLetterMedia keep
inching closer to a million subscribers any longer.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.060
Can we get these guys their gold play button already?
Click and subscribe.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.700
"What's your favorite joke you've hidden in a video?"

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.720
*hmmmm*

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.800
I'm gonna let this one slide because
oh man, do I love hiding stuff in videos!

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.480
And it brings me tremendous joy
when people find all the things!

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.260
For example, have you found all the bees?
There's a lot of them now.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.420
Again, no *favorites*, but a recent one I'm pleased with

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.880
is this dude in the airport reading The Hobbit,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.740
and then the Fellowship of the Ring
and then the entire Rings Trilogy.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.020
Implying the wait to board that flight was really long.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.920
"Favorite integer?"

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.760
No, I don't-

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:18.420
"Favorite colour?"

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.240
I-I shouldn't have-

00:02:19.248 --> 00:02:20.269
"Favorite Magic colors?"

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.340
Well, black and blue obviously but-

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.000
"No getting around this one. Favorite Youtuber?"

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.620
You know, these people are my friends!
It would be really weird to pick a-

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.340
"Favorite podcast?"

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.640
No, I already explained-

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.260
"Favorite movie?"

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.600
"Favorite Liberian county flag?"

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.340
"Favorite world leader?"

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.700
You can't be serious-

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.649
"Favorite law of physics?"

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:34.560
"Favorite conspiracy theory?"

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.336
"Favorite tree?"

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.840
What!?

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.060
"On a scale of 1-10,
what is your favorite color of the alphabet?"

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.840
Ah, no, okay. This is my fault!
I shouldn't have opened this door-

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.320
"What is your favourite spelling of favorite?"

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.680
Okay, enough of this! Let's take a quick break and reset.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.020
This Q&amp;A intermission is brought to you by Skillshare.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.920
Skillshare is the online learning community with over
25,000 classes in design, business, technology and more.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.820
If you want to learn it,
Skillshare almost certainly has a class on it.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.600
Like say you want to learn how to
make animated videos just like these.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.260
Well Skillshare has classes from both
PolyMatter and Kurzgesagt on how to do it.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.660
Once you've made that video there's classes on how to
market it and how to manage your online business.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.840
I was trying to learn Motion recently.
Guess where I went? I went to Skillshare.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.160
Join the millions of students learning on Skillshare today!

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:20.180

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.460
Skillshare!!!

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.540
Now back to the show.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.220
"Any thoughts in your head right now?"

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.120
I hope people realize there was
more video after the intermission...

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.080
"What is the most persistent physical object you own?"

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.160
Ooh, that's a good question! 
Like it must be my original wedding ring.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.680
I can't think of an object that's been with me longer.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.500
I currently wear a second edition, which will eventually
become the third most persistent object in my life.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.300
*rings hit each other*

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:47.760
"What's the second most persistent?"

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.900
Well, while moving office recently, I found it
hiding in an envelope at the bottom of a box.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.140
Sure I had thrown it away. Positive in fact!

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.360
But somehow this specter evaded
my many moves and purges.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.060
I have NO idea how it shadowed me,
hiding nearby for a decade.

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.420
So to explain this thing. Back in the long ago,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.180
I quit teaching, packed all my belongings,
bundled my savings, heading off into the sunset

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.560
with the sure knowledge I was
to achieve the project of my life.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.800
To escape the system. To become self-employed.
To be free!

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.840
And I...

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.960
totally failed.
Burned through my savings and returned to London,

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.200
humbled having to find another teaching job.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.240
That year of failure was not a great time

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.240
and what I thought would be my Mjolnir with which
to forge my new life was instead a cursed object.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.500
This original MacBook Air!
The laptop sold on its thinness and lightness.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.600
The machine I spent a significant
portion of my savings on

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.540
as it seemed perfect for the life
of peregrination before me.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:56.820
This laptop was a disaster, with catastrophic
thermal problems making it run painfully slow.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.680
And during this dark time I lived in Hawaii 
with family to save money.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.860
Now, Hawaii...

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.320
... doesn't believe in air conditioning. Because the island is 'paradise' and the weather is 'perfect'!

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.960
It isn't!

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:14.100
I have such a visceral memory of being
inescapably hot and sweaty trying to work

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.980
while heat poured out from the keyboard,
melting me... melting my dreams.

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.600
I thought I had long gotten rid of this totem
of the absolute failure of a younger man.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:30.580
But it's weird! Now that it's been so long, I kind of want
to mount it on my office wall as #neverforget

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.500
I don't think I really will, but... I haven't thrown it out yet.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.560
"What is one topic you will never discuss?"

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.180
How... am I to answer this question?

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.040
"Is there still hope for the Catan video?"

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.880
*Intense sounds*

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.020
...No.

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.440
"What are your tips on improving one's ability to read?"

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.200
Spend less time on the Tweetbooks and Snapstagrams.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.400
I kind of left a lot of the internet...
Temporarily? A while back.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.600
I don't know if you've heard. I've only made a vlog
and talked about it repeatedly on my podcasts.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.720
Anyway, I think Internet comments train my brain
to have a short attention span.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.460
So less of the Reddit = more of the books
which I think is a net positive.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.600
But I do miss the Wild West of the Internets.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.100
Sometimes I can hear the memes calling me.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.176
Now, anything you want to have
more of in your life like reading,

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:19.620
also try to decide ahead of time what you're
going to have less of to make space for it.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.240
Saying you want to do more X 
without also saying what you want to do less Y of

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.540
is a recipe for failure.
In life, there are no solutions, only trade-offs.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.520
"How come you don't mention D&amp;D more often?"

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.760
Despite, as you might imagine, the child me
being right in the demographic for D&amp;D,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.380
I never played it! 
So that's why I don't mention it.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:44.360
The closest I ever got was baby's first D&amp;D: HeroQuest, 
which I loved playing as the dungeon master.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.160
"Does it frustrate you how all the months have different numbers of days?"

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.660
It makes spreadsheets very untidy, so yes.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.800
"Have any answers from the previous Q&amp;As changed?"

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.200
Man, every time this gets asked I have
more videos to check.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.620
This time through, I noticed I've previously
mentioned a proportional Senate

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.160
as one of my top three changes to the Constitution.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.140
Which was totally surprising to current me to see.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.860
Maybe past me meant a Senate run by MMP.
If so, I didn't make that very clear.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.360
Anyway! I'm still pretty firmly against the
Electoral College, not because of the original idea

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.660
but because of what has changed in the last...
centuries.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.653
But the House and Senate system 
seems like a pretty good way to try to

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.960
balance the power of the states and the people.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.080
"What's your favorite exit?"

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.820
The exit of my people: the Irish exit.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.280
Goodbyes are uncomfortable.
When you're done, you're done!

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.840
Just go.......   *poof*
