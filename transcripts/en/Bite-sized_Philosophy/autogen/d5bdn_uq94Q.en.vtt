00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.240
one of the things that I learned that

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250
one of the things that I learned that
 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.100
one of the things that I learned that
while I was going through this was the

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110
while I was going through this was the
 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.749
while I was going through this was the
meaning of the name Israel because Jacob

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759
meaning of the name Israel because Jacob
 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.169
meaning of the name Israel because Jacob
eventually gets named Israel and and I'm

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179
eventually gets named Israel and and I'm
 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.180
eventually gets named Israel and and I'm
jumping ahead a little bit to the next

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190
jumping ahead a little bit to the next
 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.999
jumping ahead a little bit to the next
lecture but Israel and so he's also the

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009
lecture but Israel and so he's also the
 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.650
lecture but Israel and so he's also the
father of Israel and the father of the

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660
father of Israel and the father of the
 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.320
father of Israel and the father of the
twelve sons who make up the 12 tribes of

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330
twelve sons who make up the 12 tribes of
 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:18.680
twelve sons who make up the 12 tribes of
Israel

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690
Israel
 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.540
Israel
but what Israel means is he who

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550
but what Israel means is he who
 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.599
but what Israel means is he who
struggles with God and that's such an

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609
struggles with God and that's such an
 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.580
struggles with God and that's such an
interesting idea because it's a again a

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590
interesting idea because it's a again a
 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.519
interesting idea because it's a again a
psychological idea and that's why I said

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529
psychological idea and that's why I said
 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.200
psychological idea and that's why I said
earlier that it isn't obvious in the Old

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210
earlier that it isn't obvious in the Old
 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.820
earlier that it isn't obvious in the Old
Testament what it means to believe in

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830
Testament what it means to believe in
 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.740
Testament what it means to believe in
God because what Jacob does is struggle

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750
God because what Jacob does is struggle
 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.870
God because what Jacob does is struggle
with God and I think that that's a

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880
with God and I think that that's a
 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.020
with God and I think that that's a
really good characterization of an

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030
really good characterization of an
 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.819
really good characterization of an
ethical life because if you're trying to

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829
ethical life because if you're trying to
 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.139
ethical life because if you're trying to
lead an ethical life that's what you're

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149
lead an ethical life that's what you're
 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.569
lead an ethical life that's what you're
doing is you're you're struggling like

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579
doing is you're you're struggling like
 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.760
doing is you're you're struggling like
blind belief isn't helpful because you

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770
blind belief isn't helpful because you
 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.290
blind belief isn't helpful because you
don't know what you're believing in like

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300
don't know what you're believing in like
 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.779
don't know what you're believing in like
it's just not that helpful but if you're

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789
it's just not that helpful but if you're
 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.080
it's just not that helpful but if you're
possessed by by the desire to orient

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
possessed by by the desire to orient
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.299
possessed by by the desire to orient
yourself properly but also confused by

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309
yourself properly but also confused by
 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.520
yourself properly but also confused by
the by the existential structure of the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530
the by the existential structure of the
 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.920
the by the existential structure of the
world which we all are then then what

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930
world which we all are then then what
 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.939
world which we all are then then what
you're doing when you're trying to

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949
you're doing when you're trying to
 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.680
you're doing when you're trying to
orient yourself properly in life is

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690
orient yourself properly in life is
 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.250
orient yourself properly in life is
struggling ethically and Jacob actually

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
struggling ethically and Jacob actually
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.899
struggling ethically and Jacob actually
gets quite hurt he wrestles with God

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909
gets quite hurt he wrestles with God
 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.469
gets quite hurt he wrestles with God
literally and God dislocates his his his

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
literally and God dislocates his his his
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.390
literally and God dislocates his his his
thigh and so you know the idea there is

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400
thigh and so you know the idea there is
 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.969
thigh and so you know the idea there is
watch the hell out right the thing that

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979
watch the hell out right the thing that
 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.640
watch the hell out right the thing that
you're contending with is powerful

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
you're contending with is powerful
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.560
you're contending with is powerful
although you can contend with it that's

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570
although you can contend with it that's
 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.270
although you can contend with it that's
the thing that's so interesting but you

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280
the thing that's so interesting but you
 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.190
the thing that's so interesting but you
know you do it at some genuine peril

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
know you do it at some genuine peril
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.560
know you do it at some genuine peril
which i think is exactly right but the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
which i think is exactly right but the
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.319
which i think is exactly right but the
idea that Israel so there's Israel the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329
idea that Israel so there's Israel the
 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.060
idea that Israel so there's Israel the
state let's say in Israel the promised

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070
state let's say in Israel the promised
 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.260
state let's say in Israel the promised
land and all of that but there's this

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270
land and all of that but there's this
 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.060
land and all of that but there's this
more important idea which is again a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070
more important idea which is again a
 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.460
more important idea which is again a
psychological idea which is the State of

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470
psychological idea which is the State of
 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.740
psychological idea which is the State of
Israel which is the promised land is the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750
Israel which is the promised land is the
 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.050
Israel which is the promised land is the
state that everyone who wrestles with

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060
state that everyone who wrestles with
 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.560
state that everyone who wrestles with
God exists in and that's not happy naive

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570
God exists in and that's not happy naive
 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.550
God exists in and that's not happy naive
belief in you know an eternally blessed

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
belief in you know an eternally blessed
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.980
belief in you know an eternally blessed
afterlife it's not that it's not a wish

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
afterlife it's not that it's not a wish
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.230
afterlife it's not that it's not a wish
fulfillment it's it's it's to be

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240
fulfillment it's it's it's to be
 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.929
fulfillment it's it's it's to be
actively engaged in life in the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939
actively engaged in life in the
 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.690
actively engaged in life in the
difficulties of life right and trying to

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700
difficulties of life right and trying to
 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.789
difficulties of life right and trying to
find the path because that's what

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799
find the path because that's what
 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.010
find the path because that's what
wrestling with God is it's trying to

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020
wrestling with God is it's trying to
 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.040
wrestling with God is it's trying to
find the path and that seems to me what

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050
find the path and that seems to me what
 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.290
find the path and that seems to me what
belief means fundamentally in the Old

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300
belief means fundamentally in the Old
 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.460
belief means fundamentally in the Old
Testament perhaps and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470
Testament perhaps and
 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.040
Testament perhaps and
New Testament as well is that belief is

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050
New Testament as well is that belief is
 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.980
New Testament as well is that belief is
expressed in trying to find the path and

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990
expressed in trying to find the path and
 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.170
expressed in trying to find the path and
that's an ethical struggle and it's a

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180
that's an ethical struggle and it's a
 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.940
that's an ethical struggle and it's a
real struggle it's the struggle of life

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950
real struggle it's the struggle of life
 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.230
real struggle it's the struggle of life
so as long as you're willing to engage

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240
so as long as you're willing to engage
 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.920
so as long as you're willing to engage
in that struggle then hypothetically you

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930
in that struggle then hypothetically you
 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.500
in that struggle then hypothetically you
have the Divine behind you and so I

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510
have the Divine behind you and so I
 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.410
have the Divine behind you and so I
believe that I think that's true because

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420
believe that I think that's true because
 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.230
believe that I think that's true because
the other thing I see is that the people

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240
the other thing I see is that the people
 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.190
the other thing I see is that the people
who set things right so that yeah the

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200
who set things right so that yeah the
 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.130
who set things right so that yeah the
the horrible forces of cosmic

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140
the horrible forces of cosmic
 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.680
the horrible forces of cosmic
destruction don't do us in the people

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690
destruction don't do us in the people
 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.150
destruction don't do us in the people
who are trying to set things right are

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160
who are trying to set things right are
 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.770
who are trying to set things right are
the ones that are struggling ethically

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
the ones that are struggling ethically
 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.830
the ones that are struggling ethically
and so and that there is a redemptive

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840
and so and that there is a redemptive
 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.810
and so and that there is a redemptive
element to that and I don't think

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820
element to that and I don't think
 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.460
element to that and I don't think
there's any way of being cynical about

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470
there's any way of being cynical about
 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.690
there's any way of being cynical about
that so well so thank you will

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700
that so well so thank you will
 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.750
that so well so thank you will
[Applause]
