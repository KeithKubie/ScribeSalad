00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.020
We may have discovered hundreds of exoplanets,
but this new alien world is one of the weirdest

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.210
yet.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.400
Hello!

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.740
I’m Ian O’Neill, space producer for Discovery
News and I have a confession -- I’m a bit

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:14.050
of an exoplanet addict.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:18.001
I’m fascinated by every exoplanet discovery
-- we live in an incredible age where we can

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:21.470
see worlds of all sizes orbiting stars many
light-years away.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.409
This is all part of an exciting quest to ultimately
track down a world with similar qualities

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:26.409
to Earth.

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:30.039
I’m my lifetime I hope that astronomers
will discover a true Earth-like world that

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.390
we are able to probe its atmosphere and find
possible biosignatures.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.410
In other words: finding a world that could
host a life-giving alien biosphere.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.260
The event of finding a truly habitable alien
world may be a long way off, but for now we

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.870
have missions like NASA’s Kepler Space Telescope
doing mindblowing work detecting small worlds,

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.440
big worlds and worlds that are just plain
WEIRD.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.920
And this latest exoplanet discovery definitely
falls into the “weird” category.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.180
Kepler-432b is the densest exoplanet discovered
to date with a mass of SIX times that of Jupiter,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.489
but with all that mass jammed into a planet
of Jupiter’s size.

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.630
But how do you go about measuring the mass
of a planet that is nearly 3,000 light-years

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.630
away?

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.490
First detected by NASA’s Kepler space telescope
in 2014, the mission was able to measure the

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.670
planet’s physical size by gauging how much
light of its host star would dim each time

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.100
it orbited in front.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.409
These dimming events are known as “transits”
and they can be used to work out the size

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.310
and orbital period of distant worlds.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.479
But to measure the planet’s mass, astronomers
using two Spanish ground based observatories

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.490
measured the slight “wobble” of the star
as that planet orbited.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.909
The more massive the planet, the greater its
gravitational effects and the greater the

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:31.909
star’s wobble.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:34.869
This type of observation is known as the “radial
velocity” method.

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.659
When observed over a long period, a precise
measurement of the planet’s mass can be

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:39.659
recorded.

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.700
By combining data from transit and radial
velocity methods, it’s a fairly simple calculation

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.009
to arrive at the planet’s density, combining
the mass and size.

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.729
And it just so happens that this is one seriously
dense planet.

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.499
But its density isn’t the only thing that
makes Kepler-432b unique -- it also has one

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:59.599
of the most eccentric -- or stretched -- orbits
of all the exoplanets discovered to date.

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:03.869
During the 52 day orbit around its star, the
world suffers some extreme seasonal heating.

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.950
At its furthest orbital point, the exoplanet
is a hot 1000 degrees Fahrenheit, but at its

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.640
closest approach, it bakes to over 1800 degrees.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.990
Its orbit is a clue as to why we don’t see
these kinds of exoplanets very often.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.620
Kepler-432b is a world with an expiration
date.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.530
Its host star is a huge red giant that is
undergoing its final death throes after running

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.040
out of hydrogen fuel in its core.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.420
It is predicted to become so puffed up that
its scorching plasma will likely swallow the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.970
unfortunate exoplanet in around 200 million
years time.

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.040
Therefore, Kepler-432b is a planet of extremes.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.000
It’s extremely dense; it has a hellish rollercoaster
orbit and it is destined to be destroyed by

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.640
a stellar blowtorch in the not-so-distant
future.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.040
Although this is one world certainly not suitable
for life as we know it, it’s yet another

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.340
reminder about how rich and diverse our galaxy
is, filled with exoplanets that are very different

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:59.510
to the planets contained within our own solar
system.
