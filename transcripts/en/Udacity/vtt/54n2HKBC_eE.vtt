00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.680
Here's a UML diagram we might come up with. On this we have the viewport at

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.810
the top, the scrollbar in the middle, and the file manager at the,

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:14.080
at the bottom. Notice that the, whereas in the earlier diagram

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.600
we had associations among the components, here we've converted these into dash

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.500
lines which in UML correspond to dependencies amongst, amongst the components.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.560
Dependencies are something which the ultimate implementation languages have many

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.560
mechanisms such as procedure calls to implement. So we don't have to worry about

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.450
vague concepts of associations. We can deal directly with, with dependencies
