Mobile phones, are they really mobile? Let's

00:00:02.922 --> 00:00:05.542
conduct a quick experiment to determine that.

00:00:05.542 --> 00:00:10.820
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.950
&gt;&gt; I's not doing anything. It's not going anywhere.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.296
&gt;&gt; Really? Oh, correct. Well, it turns out mobile phones

00:00:15.296 --> 00:00:20.080
aren't mobile. What is mobile are people that use these phones.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.450
&gt;&gt; And the reason we love our smart phones so much

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.830
is because it fits naturally in our mobile lifestyle and it

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.760
fits naturally into our hands. Which brings us to our next

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.790
mobile constraint called handedness. So let's jump right to a quiz.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.980
&gt;&gt; So you have four screens here. Each one has

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.650
two actions that you can perform on it. Which one of these

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.070
screens best serves the user using this application with a single hand?
