00:00:00.337 --> 00:00:02.535
In the last video, we
started thinking a little bit

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:05.002
about the aggregate demand curve

00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:07.623
and why it might be downward sloping

00:00:07.623 --> 00:00:09.936
and we actually reviewed
some of the possible

00:00:09.936 --> 00:00:12.470
justifications for a downwards sloping

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.736
aggregate demand curve, the wealth affect.

00:00:14.736 --> 00:00:16.336
Remember, all other things equal.

00:00:16.336 --> 00:00:18.470
We're not talking about
changing the amount of money

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:20.442
in people's pockets or
changing their outlook

00:00:20.442 --> 00:00:22.207
or changing their jobs or changing

00:00:22.207 --> 00:00:23.671
the level of investment, we're just saying

00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:26.275
if prices were to just go down,

00:00:26.275 --> 00:00:28.670
all of a sudden people would
have ... They'd feel richer

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.405
because they could buy
more with what they have

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:33.206
and so they might ... They
might want to buy more,

00:00:33.206 --> 00:00:34.623
demand more and so those things

00:00:34.623 --> 00:00:38.736
would have to be produced
and so real GDP would go up.

00:00:38.736 --> 00:00:40.874
Real GDP would go up and
that was the Wealth Affect

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.605
and likewise if prices went up,

00:00:42.605 --> 00:00:43.873
the opposite would happen.

00:00:43.873 --> 00:00:45.804
People would have less money or

00:00:45.804 --> 00:00:47.136
they would have the same amount of money

00:00:47.136 --> 00:00:49.039
in their pockets, but they
could buy less with it

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.470
and so they would demand less

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.328
and real GDP would go ... real GDP,

00:00:54.328 --> 00:00:55.955
real GDP would go down.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:59.137
The other factor or justification
I should really say,

00:00:59.137 --> 00:01:01.206
because these are really
just theories so you should

00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:03.002
view them with huge grains of salt,

00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:06.110
is that if prices ... If
the general level of prices

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:08.938
were to go down, then
interest rates would go down

00:01:08.938 --> 00:01:10.270
and if interest rates would go down,

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.469
there would be more investments.

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:14.742
So prices go down, more
investment. GDP goes up.

00:01:14.742 --> 00:01:17.246
Prices go up. Interest rates would go up.

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:20.635
Real GDP would shrink
and we would go over here

00:01:20.635 --> 00:01:22.873
and then the last one dealt with exports

00:01:22.873 --> 00:01:25.597
and that if general
price levels went down,

00:01:25.597 --> 00:01:27.041
both interest rates would go down

00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:29.719
and just things would be
cheaper in that country

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:32.670
and so we might have more net exports.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.707
So once again, prices
go down. GDP expands.

00:01:35.707 --> 00:01:38.738
Prices go up. GDP ... GDP contracts.

00:01:38.738 --> 00:01:41.804
All of these are possible
theories or justification

00:01:41.804 --> 00:01:45.671
for a downward sloping
aggregate demand curve.

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:47.822
What I want to do in
this video is think about

00:01:47.822 --> 00:01:49.271
what, all other things equal,

00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:52.540
what might cause the aggregate
demand curve to shift

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.874
and how would it cause the

00:01:53.874 --> 00:01:55.605
aggregate command curve to shift?

00:01:55.605 --> 00:01:57.108
And to think about that,

00:01:57.108 --> 00:01:59.270
to think about what the
possible causes could be,

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.594
we just have to think about
well, what are all of the things

00:02:01.594 --> 00:02:03.073
that make up GDP?

00:02:03.073 --> 00:02:06.069
And you might remember GDP and we use Y

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.736
as the variable for GDP.

00:02:07.736 --> 00:02:13.142
It's equal to ... It's equal
to consumption plus investment

00:02:13.142 --> 00:02:17.873
plus government spending plus net exports

00:02:17.873 --> 00:02:19.404
and this is a pretty
good way to think about

00:02:19.404 --> 00:02:21.623
what are all the things that might shift

00:02:21.623 --> 00:02:23.624
the aggregate demand curve.

00:02:23.624 --> 00:02:26.039
First of all you could
think about consumption,

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:27.707
if there was some factor that would cause

00:02:27.707 --> 00:02:29.289
consumption to increase.

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:32.803
So maybe you have a ...
something like a tax cut.

00:02:32.803 --> 00:02:34.736
You have a tax cut and you don't have a

00:02:34.736 --> 00:02:36.941
corresponding government spending cut,

00:02:36.941 --> 00:02:38.136
so essentially the
government would have to.

00:02:38.136 --> 00:02:40.070
If the government is already
spending all the money it has,

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.874
it would probably have
to go in to debt to allow

00:02:42.874 --> 00:02:45.373
this tax cut to happen,
but if you had this tax cut

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:46.938
all of a sudden people
would have more money

00:02:46.938 --> 00:02:50.213
in their pockets and they
might be able to demand more.

00:02:50.213 --> 00:02:52.138
That would cause ... that would cause

00:02:52.138 --> 00:02:55.671
consumption to go up and it
would make ... it would make

00:02:55.671 --> 00:02:58.026
aggregate ... aggregate productivity or

00:02:58.026 --> 00:02:59.596
aggregate demand go up.

00:02:59.596 --> 00:03:02.737
So if you have a tax cut,
something like that for consumers,

00:03:02.737 --> 00:03:05.070
that might shift aggregate
demand to the right

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.589
at any given level of prices,

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:08.371
people are going to demand more.

00:03:08.371 --> 00:03:11.675
Likewise, if you had a tax
increase and that tax increase

00:03:11.675 --> 00:03:14.004
wasn't ... also didn't have
more government spending,

00:03:14.004 --> 00:03:15.957
then aggregate demand
would go the other way.

00:03:15.957 --> 00:03:18.911
So tax cut, it would shift
to the right for people.

00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:21.138
If there was a tax increase,
all other things equal,

00:03:21.138 --> 00:03:24.471
it would probably shift to the
left, if you believe this model.

00:03:24.471 --> 00:03:25.802
Likewise, investment.

00:03:25.802 --> 00:03:29.527
Maybe government ... Maybe the government

00:03:29.527 --> 00:03:32.206
allows all of a sudden
companies to write-off

00:03:32.206 --> 00:03:34.472
investments that they make
this year or there are some

00:03:34.472 --> 00:03:37.123
tax benefit from making
investments in this year

00:03:37.123 --> 00:03:41.039
and so you could have situations
where for whatever reason

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:43.670
investment ... investment were
to go up or it could just be

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.823
a natural ... There might be
a newly discovered industry

00:03:46.823 --> 00:03:49.070
where all of a sudden or
resources that people start

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.539
investing in to find that
thing and once again that would

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:56.137
cause aggregate GDP to
go up, more investment.

00:03:56.137 --> 00:03:57.956
And then the third piece of this,

00:03:57.956 --> 00:04:00.206
we have the direct government.

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:01.736
We have the government right over here.

00:04:01.736 --> 00:04:03.206
So if the government says,

00:04:03.206 --> 00:04:06.394
"Hey, maybe ... Maybe
we're going to incur",

00:04:06.394 --> 00:04:08.096
assuming they're already
spending as much money

00:04:08.096 --> 00:04:09.520
as they have or maybe more than they have,

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.815
"We're going to incur
even more ... even more

00:04:11.815 --> 00:04:14.289
"debt to ... to spend more money."

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:16.603
So if government spending were to go up,

00:04:16.603 --> 00:04:17.784
If government spending were to go up,

00:04:17.784 --> 00:04:20.069
that would also shift the
demand curve to the right

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:22.206
and all other things equal,
if government spending were

00:04:22.206 --> 00:04:25.471
to go down that might shift
demand curve to the left

00:04:25.471 --> 00:04:27.337
and the last one and this might be

00:04:27.337 --> 00:04:28.873
a little bit common sense to you.

00:04:28.873 --> 00:04:31.707
If for whatever reason, maybe
our country all of a sudden

00:04:31.707 --> 00:04:34.776
produces some goods and services
that the rest of the world

00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:37.802
really, really, really values.
They can't produce it themselves

00:04:37.802 --> 00:04:39.804
and that net exports were to go up,

00:04:39.804 --> 00:04:42.069
if net exports were to go
up, that means more people

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:44.789
in other countries are buying
our goods and services,

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.706
then that, too, would cause
aggregate demand to go up

00:04:47.706 --> 00:04:50.206
or on the other hand, if all of
a sudden people in our country

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:51.805
started saying, "Hey, we don't
want to buy the stuff that we"

00:04:51.805 --> 00:04:53.618
"produce. We want to buy
what the people on the other"

00:04:53.618 --> 00:04:54.956
"side of the ocean are producing."

00:04:54.956 --> 00:04:57.336
That would make aggregate demand go down.

00:04:57.336 --> 00:04:59.138
So to really think about
how aggregate demand shifts,

00:04:59.138 --> 00:05:02.105
you just have to really think
about the components of GDP

00:05:02.105 --> 00:05:06.804
and how different macro ...
macro things might impact

00:05:06.804 --> 00:05:08.873
those components of GDP and
those will tell you whether

00:05:08.873 --> 00:05:12.470
at a ... at a given level of
prices of goods and services

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.438
in the economy whether it'll
shift demand to the right

00:05:15.438 --> 00:05:18.000
or to the left.
