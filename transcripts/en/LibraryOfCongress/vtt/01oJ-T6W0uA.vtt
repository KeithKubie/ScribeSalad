00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.780
I want to thank each of you
for taking the time to come

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.930
to the most beautiful
building in Washington DC

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.770
but most especially, to the
Coolidge Auditorium to be a part

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.670
of our Veterans Day programming.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.950
As direct I'm Karen Lloyd
and I'm the director

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.130
of the Veterans History Project,

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.950
and as a retired army aviator
I'm also the widow, sibling

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.700
and child of veterans.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.690
And I'm so pleased to welcome
you, especially the veterans,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.810
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.310
The library makes a special
effort this week in particular

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.580
to honor and recognize
veterans and their families

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.960
and to explore the ways military
men and women have connected

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.640
to home and family during
and after their service

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.890
for World War I through
the current conflicts.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.290
We are proud to collaborate
with our colleagues

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.540
from across the library to
offer a series of events titled:

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:20.510

to are exhibited
echoes of the Great War.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.430
This exhibit examines the
upheaval of the World War

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.760
as Americans confronted it,
both at home and abroad.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.600
It's located up here in
the Jefferson building

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.440
and its compellingly
rendered offers glimpses

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.230
of The Human Condition
Transcendence of Time and Place,

30 collections

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.690
from the Veterans
History Project.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.400
I hope you'll find
time to see it.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.370
I'd also ask that you
consider taking a copy

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.510
of not just this library
magazine, but also the other one

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.110

back as you depart.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.220
on The Veterans History
Project and our collections.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.810
Now, a little bit about The
Veterans History Project:

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.020
it provides inspiration
and instruction

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.500
to foster nationwide volunteer
effort for individuals to reach

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.970
out to the veterans and their
lives and listen really listen,

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.680
and sending donate those
collections to the library,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.410
so that we have those
oral histories

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.770
and first-person narratives.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.160
From World War I through the
current conflict Veterans

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.530

family graciously donated his

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.320
interviews with the
Veterans History Project

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.100

both through the exhibit

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.340
and through this morning's
Porter Ale by Douglas Taurel.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.180
After the performance,
both Douglas

and our senior reference
specialist Megan Harris will

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.480
answer your questions.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.780
So, again thank you for
joining us joining us today

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.450
and a special shout-out
to the Greenwall family

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.900
who made a special effort
to come today and we are

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.370
so appreciative of that.

1917, milk was 36 cents,

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.110
a loaf of bread was 9 cents

00:03:55.110 --> 00:04:00.210
and the average yearly
income of a man $6.50.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:04.260
That's what I made in
my shop, me and Leah;

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.230
we have a nice shop
in 22 E-70 Street.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.560
We sold candles,

tobacco, good tobacco.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:24.570
On April 2nd 1917, our president
Woodrow Wilson stood before a

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.910
quiet joint session of
congress and he asked

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.570
that The United States
of America declared war

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.510
against The German Empire.

I was drafted before million
other young brave boys.

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:22.360
Our war was called "The
War to End All Wars".

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.160
Just imagine that a
"War to End All Wars" --

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.510
it was called the Great War.

My day started waking up
at 5:30 a.m., for revelry,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.450
drilling with the bayonet
and then, had to put on

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:58.250
and take off a gas mask,

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.060
in any [inaudible],
exercises and supper.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.510
Supper was usually
frankfurters, sauerkraut,

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.480
bread, potatoes and coffee.

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.640
Lots and lots of coffee.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.830
Not too bad not too good
either, but not too bad.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.710
After supper, I head to the
YMCA to buy some tobacco

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.600
or have some ice cream
or to telephone Leah

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.970
if I could get a line.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.810
After supper, I head back to
my bunk to do some reading

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.460
or some writing, usually
a letter to Leah or momma,

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.680
and I always kiss Leah's
picture before I went to bed,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.980
not before saying my
prayers of course.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:44.890
Can I be honest?

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:51.060
I lay awake many nights
thinking how unfair

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.050
and unkind the army was
it since it sends so many

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.490
of us boys away from home.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:02.220
It's not really fair when
you were to think about it.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.020
My favorite days at camp
were always when the passes

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.100
to go home for the weekend
were posted up in the wall.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:10.570
I'd be so happy that I had
to run and I telephone Leah

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:15.500
and she be so delighted that she
would just, she would just cry.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:21.750
My Leah, she had an angel's
face, she was graceful,

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:28.720
and strong, she was everything,
she was everything to me.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:31.210
My entire goal on campus was
always to come home to be

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.840
with her as much as I could.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.550
When we go home for
the weekends,

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.110
I take her to the theater.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.580
The theater would be
full of men in uniform,

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.100
we'd always go see Jack O'
Lantern with Fred Stone,

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.210
he was without a doubt
my favorite comedian.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.700
I'd always kiss her
outside the theater;

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.470
you see it's not very polite
to kiss outside in public.

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.140
I'd hold her in my arms
and I'd whisper to God

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.450
"can you keep me home and
grant me a year peace,

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:04.230
happiness and a healthy baby".

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:07.640
You see, we were
going to have a child;

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.690
we were going to be a family.

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:12.210
I pray to God that he grant me
this one wish, this one wish

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.970
that I can hold my child
before I am shipped off.

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:24.940
But I wasn't, I was shipped off
before I ever saw my beautiful

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.910
baby Cecily [phonetic] born.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:33.120
I'd write in my journal
to keep my mind

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.650
from picturing the horrors
of my perspective journey.

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.510
When the dreaded day came, and
I had to tell Leah that I was,

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:46.590
that I was shipping off,
she was broken hearted.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:50.550
We both were, we both realized
this might be the last time we

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.970
would hear each other's voices.

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:03.360
I pray that I would come
back to her but I fear

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.660
that I may never see her again.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:19.030
So, we were given three
sandwiches, a cup of coffee,

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:27.190

-- and off to France, we go!

comfortable just whatsoever.

was made, and the toilet

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:54.090

waste, I mean they'll be

yourself from ever using them.

it's pretty nasty stuff.

from the filth and disease

wasn't much better either.

piece of unappetizing fish

that was tough as leather.

by everyone.

you could feel the earth shiver

00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:01.970
-- beneath your feet.

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.390
Flashes from the
sky, from the guns

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:13.000
and slow rising a
[inaudible] signals and flares.

00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:20.870
It all looked like, like a 4th

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:24.800
of July firework
celebration from back home.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:33.550
There is an example
of greatness in men,

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.240
but it's all being
degraded by the use

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.510
to which these machines
are being put to.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:42.560
[ Explosion ]

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.930
Big guns pounding away at the
French towns, turning them

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.210
into piles of rubble, you had

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.510
to respect the French
people, I did.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:56.760
Especially the women,
they had so much courage.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.810
They would stood a
tremendous amount of shielding.

00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:06.780
I remember one French madame,
a small woman, she was walking

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:11.100
on her bare feet with tears in
her eyes, she had her hands up

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:20.060
and she was saying
"J'ai peur, j'ai peur,

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.680
aidez-moi, j'ai peur".

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:33.220
"I'm scared, I'm
scared, please help".

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:45.000
In my opinion, the use of shell

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.570
in war is a cowardly
thing to do.

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.610
I mean, you're cutting out
combat and it comes at you

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:56.000
so fast, that all you
can do is wait for death.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.970
I'd be glad to fight
face to face.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:16.830
We were part of a
huge offensive;

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:18.740
it was called The Muse
our Gun Offensive.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.830
Our goal was to drive up between
the Arland [phonetic] forest

00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.320
and the News [phonetic] river.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.580
You see General Purshins
[phonetic] idea was

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.350
to cut the German supply lines

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:30.100
and drive the Germans
out of France.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.410
But the problem with the argon
force was that it was so thick,

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:37.030
with trees, you couldn't see
more than 10 feet in front

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.370
of you and it was
filled with frowny bushes

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:42.940
that would slice right through
you when you felt on them.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.560
Up until that offensive,

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:48.960
no one knew if the
American could fight,

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.890
but after that offensive,

00:16:52.890 --> 00:17:00.640
the world learned how
tough the dull boys were.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:05.640
Right before our big push,
our brigade general major,

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.850
they gathered us
around a French square,

00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:17.940
our general looks intently
into each man's eyes --

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:25.260
Boys I know you're dreadfully
keen to get in the game,

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:32.900
and you're all going to punch it
and you'll make America proud --

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:47.160
So, there you have it,
the faith of England

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:52.090
and France in our hands.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:18:04.650
I became scare from the first
time since arriving in France.

00:18:04.650 --> 00:18:07.000
What scared me the most was the
probability that I would have

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.510
to die in a trench on
my, on my wedding day.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:13.700
I was content that I would
have to die in this war

00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:15.840
but I didn't want
to die in a trench

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.320
on my wedding anniversary.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:24.250
I prayed to God that he
would grant me this wish.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:34.840
I wrote mamma to buy a bouquet
of chrysanthemums for Leah.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:45.700
I may not be alive on that day
-- but I would want her to know

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:52.070
that I thought of her on
our wedding anniversary.

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:08.690
Over the days I became really
good at writing really small,

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:10.480
and writing letters
to Leah and Momma.

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:14.460
I was really good at
utilizing every inch

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.760
of blank space in the letter.

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:21.710
It's a small item to
crawl about but --

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:26.810
paper, paper has a high value in
war, and if you can utilize it

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.110
to the fullest you feel

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.300
like you've done
something to be proud of.

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:39.950
War has a way of teaching
men how to be proud

00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:42.250
of the smallest victories.

00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:51.850
Over the next couple of
months, our nights became cold

00:19:51.850 --> 00:19:56.640
and became the filthiest most
rats infested places you could

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.940
ever imagine.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:11.230
We lived and fought in
the mud, I hated the mud.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:16.900
A lot of men died in the mud.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:20.220
We called our homes
hell on earth.

00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:24.440
"Rats", rats would crawl all
over your face when you tried

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:28.980
to sleep, and millions of flies
would feast over the dead men

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:31.840
in the open graves, and
the cooties [phonetic],

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:35.860
the cooties were the
greatest little devils.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.450
I mean, everyone had
them, of all whole sizes

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:41.310
and breeds big [inaudible]
white ones

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:43.440
and they'd always
find a warm spot,

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.530
as soon as you put your head
down they crawl down and up

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:47.790
and around your neck
and enter your trousers.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:49.090
I mean to refrain

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.390
from scratching them it would
require all the will power you

00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:57.280
can muster.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:02.950
Over time I, I became shaky

00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:05.250
for the continual
thunder of the guns --

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:12.970
It affected -- it
affected your nerves --

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.210
It affected a lot of the men --

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:29.670
When a shell would break, I
would hug the ground listening

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.380
for fragments of the
hot [inaudible] of metal

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:34.430
to strike upon the earth.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:38.530
I was right next to the
coronel whose life was safe,

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:41.670
when a piece of shrapnel
came flying in.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:44.460
If it wasn't for him
having his hand to his face

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:48.070
and eating a piece of bread,

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:51.580
his head would have been
blown completely off.

00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:57.620
Luck, luck had a lot

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:01.160
to do whether you
lived or died in war.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:11.900
It's what scared you the most,
the luck part, it scared me.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:27.140
The action started that day
when the lieutenant picked me

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:32.790
as a runner, I -- my job
was to carry messages

00:22:32.790 --> 00:22:35.230
to and from commanders.

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:38.090
You see they would
send six men out hoping

00:22:38.090 --> 00:22:40.480
that one would get through.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:45.210
It is the most deadly,
suicidal job you can have,

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:47.870
to run between enemy lines,
dodging machine guns fire,

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:53.900
hoping you weren't running past
a German sniper [gun sounds],

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:55.940
waiting to pick you off.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:04.620
A lot of brave men died as
runners, brave tired men,

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:12.090
dying as -- as errand boys.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:13.390
But, you know what?

00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:15.590
I was glad.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:18.010
I was glad because
I never wanted

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.700
to kill a man with a bayonet.

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:25.140
The English, they loved the
bayonet, they talked to it

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:33.850
with such charm and animation,
"You must love the bayonet!"

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:36.810
I resented that such a killing
instrument could ever be used

00:23:36.810 --> 00:23:39.110
in war.

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:43.880
As a runner --

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:50.350
You zig zag through the forest,
you don't just go from point A

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:54.820
to point B, you hide behind
a tree, [gun fire] you fall

00:23:54.820 --> 00:24:00.110
to the ground you use your
senses, you run to another tree,

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:05.750
you look for a landmark, you
wait for a shell to explode,

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:12.670
you run, you fall to the ground,
you run, you fall to the ground,

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:16.250
you run, you hide behind a
bush behind a dead [inaudible],

00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:20.770
behind a dead soldier.

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:24.540
You see in war we use
anything and everything

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:29.510
if it means your survival, the
smell, the smell of death is all

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:33.240
around you, dead men black
with decay buried [inaudible]

with body parts sticking
out of the ground it is;

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:41.750
it is the most fearful
thing in the dark.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:45.530
I hated to leave a man
like that, but you have to.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:50.490
You have to go on; you
find the courage to go on.

00:24:50.490 --> 00:24:52.540
Is like, I run up the hill, I
am at the mercy of the snipers

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:57.110
and the shells vivid flashes
of fire, my ears ring,

00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:01.710
my heart stops beating as I --
as I run up the hill I think

00:25:01.710 --> 00:25:07.110
of home, mama, Leah,
baby Cecily.

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:09.810
I say a prayer to the lord
to get me through this safely

00:25:09.810 --> 00:25:11.610
and suddenly, another
shell explosion.

[ Screams ]

I hug the earth and I flat.

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:26.860
I want to go on, it is worse to
wait for death than to face it.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:35.210
I curse this shell, surprise
that I am, that I'm still alive.

00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:40.820
I get up, I run, I run like
that, not a soul to be seen,

every house torn down piles
in the middle of the streets.

00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:46.300
I climb over wreckage,
more men rotting,

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:50.600
and I see one man straight
down in front of ruin church,

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:58.330
and I am, I am glad that
he is not rotting away

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:01.970

he scolds me, and questions me

for taking so long,
and he orders me

death and destruction again,

I must run, past the dead

black, eyes gone.

over position by his gun,

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:05.980
face is indistinguishable.

heart bursts, I cannot breathe,

of July celebration.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:07.050
I am incensed, that so many of
our dead men lie in the streets

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:09.070
of the villages near
us unburied.

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:10.920
I want all of us to go down

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:15.780

completely buried but,

I'm not [inaudible] the job any
more than the other boys do,

but I feel out of
decency the men,

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:36.150
the men must be given
a human burial.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:45.340
Me, Fern [phonetic] and
Summers, we chose to go,

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.510
We see one lad with a big
gaping hole in his chest;

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.970
six inches wide, it must
have killed him instantly.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:08.350
I had seen another one, he is
much more of a pitiful sight,

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:11.970
he was burnt to a cinder.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:23.860
It hurts to look upon them the
dead men, but I, I spill myself

and I perform what I
consider a human beauty.

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:49.460

it almost feels as if it,

is a reward for them --

00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:19.970
and our baby Cecily are well.

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:30.960
All night long, I
see the dead men.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.790
Especially the man
who was burnt,

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:48.230
I pondered the mystery
of life and dead.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:52.770
I just witnessed
the wonder of life

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.900
in the helplessness of dead.

00:30:57.950 --> 00:31:01.140
Why do men do it?

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.440
Why did they kill?

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.740
Why do they destroy?

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:14.200
The cost of it, the
futility of it.

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:18.530
Why not end this war?

00:31:18.530 --> 00:31:21.510
Spear all the men and women, I
mean this war will never be won

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:30.570
at the battlefield, I have no
courage to live, no will to --

00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:37.450
To fight, to go on --

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:52.550
I hold on thinking
of Lea, baby Cecily.

00:31:55.700 --> 00:32:01.010
My eyes are bad for
all the tear gas.

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:03.970
My throat is sore, my
lungs are congested --

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:13.080
As I look around I see
a war pitiful sight,

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.840
I see some of our boys and
French soldiers who are been

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.950
in tear gas, they
are in great pain.

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:22.960
Their eyes are red and
swollen, there coughing

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.740
and vomiting in there.

00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:29.850
Heavily burns around
the arms and the legs.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:37.100
You see, you cannot
smell mustard gas;

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:41.750
your nose becomes accustomed
to it from smelling it so much.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:50.120
It almost has a sweet aroma
to it, like onions or garlic,

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:57.910
once you're expose red spots
begin to show upon your skin,

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:07.110
and eventually you feel the
pain and the swelling in nose

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:17.070
and in your lungs and you
die, no, no, you, you drown,

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:19.790
you drown from all the
mucus in your lungs.

00:33:21.570 --> 00:33:23.870
It is a brutal weapon --

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.080
If she only knew how foolishly
I risked my life today,

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.380
she would most definitely cry.

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:41.170
I think how unfair this
business of war is,

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:43.970
especially to all the
mothers and wives back home.

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:54.910
After dinner, our
captain tells us that,

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:58.190
our [inaudible] will be sent
all over to the German lines,

00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:01.350
and that we would go
over the top to mop

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:04.800
up after wards into
no man's land.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:08.320
We would wait for his whistle,
climb out of these trenches,

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.790
tumble out, charge 30 yards
to the [inaudible] tangle man

00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:16.950
and zigzag towards our
enemy, hoping to scape there.

00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:21.090
I grow angry at this war and the
men who prolong it and decide

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:22.820
of so much destruction.

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:34.380
I wonder if I will ever be
given the chance to see home.

00:34:41.090 --> 00:34:49.320
You are given orders to wait,
which gives us time to wonder

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:55.640
and shutter about what the
night has stored for us.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:05.510
In the dark I, I used my
pack for a, for a pillow.

00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:14.920
I sit, I wait, I
pray, and I think --

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.800
Are we fit to fight?

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:31.470
No.

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:41.580
At 9:00p.m. --

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.100
The door to hell is
open [gun explosion].

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:53.650
I mean, every gun fired
for all it's worth,

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:56.800
it is the most wicked
snap and crack to them.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.650
All of which makes it
necessary to shut when talking,

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:02.820
the skies filled up with
red, white, green flares

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:05.180
over the entire German lines.

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.850
It is [inaudible] which
continuing to an instant flash,

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:10.830
million twinkling stars
to show up for one second

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.320
and appear another's, but
a second later they are

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.490
like beautiful dancing lights.

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:23.620
The lieutenant, he comes
tearing down the trench steeping

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:28.410
over [inaudible], heads and
ankles, and then he shouts,

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:32.070
"I need six more runners,
one for each company now".

00:36:32.070 --> 00:36:34.550
No volunteers from
any of the dugouts.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:38.880
I hide my face and then
I hear Greyri [phonetic]!

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:50.200
He picks me again,
he picks his victims.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:37:00.570
I, god I, will never make it
home, he also picks Riley,

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:05.120
Soliman [phonetic] and Thompson,
a small man, a good man,

00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:09.550
who is so scared of
all the shouting.

00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:14.720
That night we were all
scared, but then he tells us

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.280
that is our mission to
find first battalion

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.580
and that it is imperative

00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:22.300
that we stablish a
communication line.

00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:25.510
We will wait for his whistle --

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:31.530
[ Clock and Whistle ]

00:37:31.530 --> 00:37:33.410
And then we tumble out,
and we go all over the top

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:36.410
into the dark, thorny
bush into no man's land.

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:39.740
It's sticky and dark, and we
are immediately lost [thunders].

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:43.450
Riley and I shout and suddenly I
don't know where a machinegun is

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:50.800
and opens up [gunshots],
and Thompson is shot

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.450
in the head, by a machinegun.

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:58.910
Good bald pallid Thompson I
was, this morning I was joking

00:37:58.910 --> 00:38:01.870
with him and now he is no more.

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:05.150
A good man, a father
of two and a man

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:06.660
who should have never
been in the army.

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.230
I mourn his lost, the
lieutenant returns and scolds

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:14.250
at us for not keeping up.

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:15.930
I believe I can keep
up better than Riley,

00:38:15.930 --> 00:38:18.400
so I work my way forward,
stumbling my head,

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.600
almost slicing my arms off

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.920
against the wet wire
hidden in the brush.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.690
Stabbing my hands and my
face, we are to the best

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:28.740
of my knowledge deep into no
man's land, at plain sight

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:34.760
from plain Kaiser's snipers, the
paces its fast and I'm panting

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.530
and lieutenant he just
questionably he stops getting

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:40.410
yells at us, ¡catch up!

00:38:40.410 --> 00:38:43.190
Distressingly we saw a living
trenches narrowing wide,

00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:46.590
crashing into a brush
thirsty but we cannot rest,

00:38:46.590 --> 00:38:52.610
with all the machinegun there's
all around us, breathless,

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:56.460
senseless with fear, lieutenant
draws out his revolver

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.980
with a pale face and he
is a sight for an artist.

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:02.470
We must hurry to the other side
of the hill before we are cut

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:04.770
down by machinegun fire.

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:06.890
The gun sound, the thunder,
the flares are lightning,

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:10.120
and the rain is [explosion
sounds] and then suddenly,

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:12.290
right in from of lieutenant
and Riley a shell explodes,

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:14.810
and I literally watch
them [Explosion] --

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:26.970
Disappear.

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:33.110
&gt;&gt; Mrs. Lea Greenwall,
deeply regret to inform you

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:34.800
that it is officially reported

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:39.210
that private Erwin W. Greenwall
infantry was wounded in action,

00:39:39.210 --> 00:39:41.870
October 8th, degree
undetermined,

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:45.120
further information
when received.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:24.120
Is October 22th.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:32.970
I've been in the hospital
for about two weeks.

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:45.480
Food hasn't been so bad,
not so good, but not so bad.

00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:50.770
For breakfast, I get a
bowl of rice, applesauce,

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:55.920
bread and coffee, lots
and lots and coffee.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.330
I can't get enough to coffee.

00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:01.930
Every few days I get cornmeal
mush with plenty of sugar

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:04.440
and what seems to be real milk,

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:15.650
some of the best milk I've
had in a long, long time.

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:18.400
As I clear the windowpanes
to look

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:24.910
out what strikes me is the
change in color in nature,

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:35.950
what used to be green and
is now red, yellow and gold.

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:51.340
But I noticed the most
because I don't --

00:41:56.330 --> 00:42:00.310
I don't hear the continual
thunder from the shells anymore.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:07.340
It is quiet.

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:10.300
The sun screams upon my back

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.800
and I can hear a [inaudible]
bell ringing outside.

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:21.880
Every morning I listen
to it, it's such a,

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:24.900
such a pleasant reminder
of home.

00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:33.250
Miss Johnson, my nurse, she
comes to clean my wound.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:42.470
She is a kind, plumped red-faced
girl from the Lemoyne, Iowa.

00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:47.700
As she removes my dressing
a stream of pause flows

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:52.000
through my wound, I was
struck by a piece of scrap

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.990
from the shell that killed
the lieutenant and Riley.

00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:01.940
The doctor, a first
lieutenant, a young man.

00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:04.370
He is of the opinion
that there is piece

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:05.950
of shrapnel still
lodging my wound

00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:07.620
that it must be fished out.

00:43:07.620 --> 00:43:13.970
He says, "Son, I need to
do a little fishing" --

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:25.970
So, he turns me over my side and
says, "This is going to hurt".

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:38.850
For ten minutes, with his
fingers he pokes into the back

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:44.670
of my leg, Miss Johnson
she holds down my leg,

00:43:44.670 --> 00:43:50.080
but I can't keep very
still, every time he digs

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.150
into the back of my leg.

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:55.450
He touches a nerve

00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:01.180
I -- I clench my fists, I grit
my teeth, I breath heavily,

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:06.910
anything to help me
withstand without screaming.

00:44:06.910 --> 00:44:10.880
This fishing and poking
goes of everyday I was

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:14.140
in the hospital just
about until finally I say,

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:19.870
"No that was enough of
your fishing and poking".

00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:25.110
The doctor gives me a
dirty look, dissatisfied

00:44:25.110 --> 00:44:32.270
with my resolve, he orders
Miss Johnson to banish my leg

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:37.770
and that is the end of that.

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:54.290
As I look around, instead
of strong straight men,

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:57.360
I see cripples in
every direction.

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:03.590
They are all beyond cure.

00:45:03.590 --> 00:45:07.780
I noticed a boy coming out of
the operation room with one leg,

00:45:07.780 --> 00:45:10.880
and he has tears on his
face and he is crying

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:13.180
for the incredible pain.

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:18.180
Seems another doctor performed
one of his delicate operations.

00:45:20.590 --> 00:45:25.500
I notice a girl face foil,
17, who later I found

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:28.010
out enlisted when it was 15.

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:36.370
He continually, he
continually cries for his mama.

00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:42.270
He's having a piece of
shrapnel removed from his spine,

00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:45.970
10 inches of his spine show
from the skull downwards.

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:54.280
I see men with great
burns faces distorted,

00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:01.780
all of them with fig
creeping wounds in them --

00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:15.690
And deeply affected and sadden
by all the mothers and wives,

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:22.600
who gave up so many great
boys for this cause.

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:28.800
And all the mothers I heard
so many boys cry out to,

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:31.950
dying in the trenches
and in no man's land.

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.260
Deep feelings are
long of missing me.

00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:46.180
I'm longing for a letter
of from Leah or mama

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:47.480
that I cannot suppress.

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:56.410
I dream of home, of Leah coming
to visit me with my baby.

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:02.960
They are delicious dreams.

00:47:04.930 --> 00:47:07.420
I have faith that in a
few days, I will be home,

00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:13.300
and I will be able to give
Leah and baby Cecily a kiss.

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:30.060
On October 31st, the
war started to end.

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:32.980
Turkey capitulates and agrees
to lay down all her arms

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:36.540
and Austria, she
throws up her hands.

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:44.240
And on November 4th, a
soldier comes running

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.970
in with a newspaper
and he shouts

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:50.110
for our silence, he

[ Inaudible question ]

00:55:05.710 --> 00:55:08.730
Yes, well my 2 o'clock
performance is called The

00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:10.850
American Soldier and it is
based on different letters

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:15.080
and different veterans
from all the wars.

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:16.670
So, The Library of
Congress contacted me

00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:19.180
and offered me six diaries
to kind of look through them

00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:22.120
and they asked me if I would be
interested in creating a project

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:25.010
to honor, to celebrate
the centennial

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:28.180
of the first World War,
and at first I was very,

00:55:28.180 --> 00:55:32.180
as I've said it many times,
in couple interviews --

00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:38.060
the work that someone did
is so valuable because a lot

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:39.620
of the diaries, all
the other diaries,

00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:42.340
they weren't transcribed
so they were written.

00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:45.090
So, by her tight writing it

00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:49.480
and then being digitized it
allowed me to basically treat it

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.480
as a text and I can basically
read it and take notes from it.

00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:57.030
And so, from that process I just
basically created to the stuff

00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:59.950
that I really like and try to
creating a begin, middle and end

00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:02.610
with my director, Patrick Lewis,

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:04.960
he should be here
somewhere, their he is.

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:11.110
And so, that's how, that's
how we kind of, we came to it.

00:56:11.110 --> 00:56:17.010
But I mean, it was a very
tedious long process still,

00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:21.920
it took me six months, the goal
was always to, do I need it now?

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:23.220
[Laughter].

00:56:23.220 --> 00:56:28.540
I didn't need it
there, I hate mics.

00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:32.710
So, yes, I basically what I
would do is I would highlight

00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:34.530
stuff that I like and I
would put it into a document

00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:37.690
and then I would read through
that, and I read the diaries

00:56:37.690 --> 00:56:39.200
from beginning to end.

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:43.500
So, and then eventually I go
from 30.000 words, 15.000 words,

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:47.100
10.000 words, and I finally had
needed to get it to 7.000 words.

00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:49.900
And then I started crafting
it into what it is today.

00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:53.080
But the diary is so powerful,
he was such an eloquent writing,

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:58.190
I mean, you could make four
plays out of his diary.

00:56:58.190 --> 00:57:01.080
So, it was really tough, because
if anybody knows anything

00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:04.190
about editing or writing,
deletion is the toughest thing

00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:10.700
to do, because I did his passage
on the ship was about as crucial

00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:13.720
as his time on the
trenches and he really talks

00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:16.360
about it really elaborately,
but you know,

00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:21.570
in fairness to theatrical
production we had

00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:25.530
to move past that so, yes.

00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:31.670
&gt;&gt; What do you regret
the most leaving out?

00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:34.550
If you had another 30
minutes, what would you put in?

00:57:34.550 --> 00:57:36.480
&gt;&gt; Douglas Taurel:
That's a great question.

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:40.890
The very beginning
because there was a couple,

00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:45.150
two moments that I couldn't find
a way, because I was restrained

00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:49.200
by time, she said "you have
45 to 50 minutes only",

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:52.050
so that was a big parameter
for what I had to do.

00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:53.950
But there was a moment in
the diary in the beginning

00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:56.890
where he really doesn't
want to go off to war,

00:57:56.890 --> 00:58:02.120
and he actually gets on a train
and he is going to go AWOL,

00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:05.750
and he was a man apparently,
for what I deduced,

00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:07.470
his name was everything
to him --

00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:11.040
and so he was terrified that
Leah, he loved his wife so much,

00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:14.840
that Leah would be stained
with having a name of a husband

00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:16.140
who would had gone AWOL.

00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:18.110
So, he literally
gets on the train

00:58:18.110 --> 00:58:22.170
and he jumps off last minute,
and he talks about it, and how,

00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:25.190
the steam the engine,
is something right

00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:26.970
out of Harry Potter the
way he describes it.

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:30.520
And it's beautiful, and I had
it in there, but it didn't,

00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:33.920
it just, it didn't fit with the
act that I was trying to do,

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:35.220
what we were trying to do.

00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:39.040
And so, the other point,
when he's in the trenches,

00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:43.190
he is actually told he can
go home, and he is static

00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:44.730
and then they come
up to him and say,

00:58:44.730 --> 00:58:48.760
"I'm sorry we made a mistake, it
is not you it is someone else".

00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:51.440
And so, he is just like
that's where that line comes

00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:54.260
"I have no will to live, I have
no courage to fight anymore".

00:58:54.260 --> 00:58:55.700
So, I took that line
and I put it there

00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:57.250
because he is really
devastated from that,

00:58:57.250 --> 00:58:58.550
and that's when he says,

00:58:58.550 --> 00:59:00.140
"I think I will never
make it home now".

00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:02.500
And he was part the
last battalion,

00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:05.850
if anybody knows anything
about the last battalion is,

00:59:05.850 --> 00:59:10.640
they suffered tremendous
casualties, and from what I get

00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:13.380
from Greeny, that's
how I call him

00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:15.610
because that's how the boys
call him they call him Greeny.

00:59:15.610 --> 00:59:21.750
He was a fairly successful
man, and he had a good shop,

00:59:21.750 --> 00:59:23.730
you know, he had a
wife who had a bay,

00:59:23.730 --> 00:59:26.760
he had a good life he sound
like he was very educated,

00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:30.240
he would have to be
to write like this.

00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:35.970
And so, to see him part of
the trenches, living with rats

00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:39.120
and there were parts were
they were starving to death,

00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:41.030
they had no water
they had a choice

00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:45.130
to drinking chlorinated
water or no water.

00:59:45.130 --> 00:59:48.640
To see him go from that extreme
to that extreme, and then,

00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:50.980
and the whole time all he
does is to talk about Lea

00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:54.990
and baby Cecily, so he
must have been madly,

00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:56.540
would they be madly in love?

00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:58.510
I had to ask because --

00:59:58.510 --> 01:00:02.040
[ Background voice ]

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:03.450
Because it feels like, I mean,

01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:05.960
almost every paragraph
he mentions her name,

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.020
so those are the two big spots

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:12.310
that I wish I could have
somehow crafted, you know.

01:00:12.310 --> 01:00:14.430
It seemed like he wants to go
home so bad that he even gets

01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:17.460
into a train he's willing to
go AWOL, but he gets scared

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:19.500
because he's afraid of what
that will do to his name

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:22.970
and he jumps the train, so yes.

01:00:29.110 --> 01:00:30.410

going to ask a question.

and the editorial job I didn't
realize you had also created the

01:00:56.050 --> 01:00:59.470
text from the diary
it's a splendid thing.

01:00:59.470 --> 01:01:02.210
I hope this is going
to be recorded and,

01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:03.510
that you're recording
it somewhere,

01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:05.110
so it can be broadcast
to a larger.

01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:06.410
&gt;&gt; Douglas Taurel:
Thank you, they are.

01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:08.070
Broadcast I don't know but
they're definitely recording it.

01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:12.050
&gt;&gt; OK, and the other question I
have, I understand he had a son

01:01:12.050 --> 01:01:15.450
who died in World War II, can we
hear something about his life?

01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:16.750
&gt;&gt; Douglas Taurel: I
don't know much about,

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:19.350
I just found out trough Naomi.

01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:24.090
You had a brother that died in
the Second World War, correct?

01:01:24.090 --> 01:01:28.310
&gt;&gt; Yes, I mean, the performance
is really about the diary

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:33.410
and it's the story of
the diary, so, you know.

01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:37.000
&gt;&gt; Generally with veteran's
projects, history projects,

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.710
we let the material speak
for itself and essentially

01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:44.660
with is archive it's designed
to do is to make it accessible

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:49.770
for researchers, for performers,
for the general public to read

01:01:49.770 --> 01:01:55.340
into it and, read into
it what they will.

01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:58.230
So, we don't do a lot of
research into the backstory

01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:01.950
of materials, simply because
that's the job for researchers

01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:05.830
and for other folks who are
going to use the materials.

01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:07.530
&gt;&gt; There's one last
question over here?

01:02:07.530 --> 01:02:11.200
&gt;&gt; Just, the journal did
it end when you got back

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:15.030
or did he continue to write
and was there more beyond

01:02:15.030 --> 01:02:17.050
and how his life
developed after that?

01:02:17.050 --> 01:02:18.350
&gt;&gt; Douglas Taurel:
It pretty much ends,

01:02:18.350 --> 01:02:22.470
it pretty much ends the
way I ended it in the play.

01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:25.860
It's actually so well written
and when you're reading it,

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:30.630
the problem even with Greeny's
diary and my second show --

01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:31.930
I've dealt with that a lot.

01:02:31.930 --> 01:02:36.430
Soldiers, for the most time
they write in fragments,

01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:38.590
a lot of them, because
they're just trying to get

01:02:38.590 --> 01:02:41.910
through the day, and
Greeny did the same thing.

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:44.790
He wrote huge chunks where
is just tedious boring stuff

01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:47.510
and fragments, fragments, and
then he would just explode

01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:51.540
into this amazing
eloquent prose.

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:55.340
But when you're reading his
diary, I mean, it ends like,

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:59.250
it goes into two sections
as you're reading it,

01:02:59.250 --> 01:03:01.920
he's literally running through
the trenches and then Riley dies

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.970
and the this dies, and
explosion, explosion, explosion

01:03:03.970 --> 01:03:07.510
and then literally it says,
"end of entry", like what?

01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:09.350
What do you mean end of entry?

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:10.650
And you're flicking through it.

01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:13.260
There's got to be another entry,
and next entry starts off with

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:16.480
"It's October 22nd I've been
in the hospital for two weeks".

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:19.040
So, that he was injured
in September 28th,

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:22.170
so you so he's probably
injured fairly bad

01:03:22.170 --> 01:03:26.710
and he probably was unconscious
is what I imagined, and so then,

01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:28.780
then it goes into the
hospital, hospital goes

01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:32.950
on for a long time, they
actually move them to hospitals.

01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:35.480
But then he comes
home and that's,

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:38.060
and that's basically
how it ends.

01:03:38.060 --> 01:03:40.650
It actually ends with
him making a phone call

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:43.880
in the snow calling
Leah: "is today I'm going

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.830
to go make a phone call,
it's pretty cold out there

01:03:45.830 --> 01:03:47.130
but I'm going to go
ahead and brave it,

01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:49.630
I want to hear her voice"
and that's the end of diary

01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:50.930
so it's very cinematic.

01:03:50.930 --> 01:03:52.230
Chris.

01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:56.950
&gt;&gt; I think we have time
for one quick question.

01:04:02.110 --> 01:04:03.830
&gt;&gt; Were there any stories
that really surprised you

01:04:03.830 --> 01:04:07.810
that you didn't expect when you
were initially going into it?

01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:17.630
&gt;&gt; Douglas Taurel: Yes, no and
yes, I mean I talked about this

01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:23.430
with my director, but it really
is and I've become a student

01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:25.580
of War because of my,
my next show, my, my,

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:26.880
the other show that
I've written.

01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:29.830
So, I've been studying
all the battles a lot,

01:04:29.830 --> 01:04:33.100
and all these brave men and
women have, their commitment

01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:36.680
and sacrifice is something that
we can never really measure

01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:40.300
but when you study
the first World War,

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:43.330
it really is like a horror show.

01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:44.740
I mean because it's
yes, but you have

01:04:44.740 --> 01:04:46.360
to remember it it's
the beginning

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.890
of the Industrial Age is the
beginning of the machinery.

01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:51.470
It was the first time that we
are using machines to fight

01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:56.440
in war and so, society and human
beings really had not been,

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.670
there's actually moments
in the first World War

01:04:58.670 --> 01:05:01.900
where the French were still
trying to fight on Calvary,

01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:03.980
and they kept getting
gunned down by machine guns

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:07.030
and they couldn't understand why
their tactics won't be in work

01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:08.860
and this went on, on both sides.

01:05:08.860 --> 01:05:13.030
So, they lost, compared
to what Americans lost

01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:15.930
to what the French and English
lost, is a drop in a bucket,

01:05:15.930 --> 01:05:18.710
they lost like 17 million men.

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:25.010
I mean, it's on, today anybody
did that it would be a revolt.

01:05:25.010 --> 01:05:29.760
So, I think what's surprising
it's just the pure carnage

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.210
of what the war is and the
way Greeny describes it,

01:05:32.210 --> 01:05:35.120
it describes it like dead
men black and decay faces so,

01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.560
when you're reading you just
like it's hard to believe so.

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.510
I'll just leave it at that
not to go too deep into it,

01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:48.290
the gore stuff, but it just
how, how violent that war was.

01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:49.920

so much for coming

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:53.290

but equally moving, I'm sure.

to welcome you especially
the veterans,

01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:28.440
to The Library of Congress.

01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:32.260
The library makes a special
effort this week in particular

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:35.270
to honor and recognize
veterans and their families,

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:37.740
and to explore the
ways that military men

01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:40.750
and women have connected
to home and family during

01:06:40.750 --> 01:06:43.100
and after their service
from World War I

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:44.980
through the current conflicts.

01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:47.320
We are proud to collaborate
with our colleagues

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:53.870
from across the library to
offer a series of events titled

01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:57.470
"Coming Home Veterans Day
at the Library of Congress".

In the back you will find
this handy card with all

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:04.150
of today's programs many of
which align with our exhibit

01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:05.910
"Echoes of the Great War".

01:07:05.910 --> 01:07:09.980
This exhibit examines
the upheaval of World War

01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:14.660
as Americans confronted it,
both at home and abroad.

01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:17.410

01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:20.700

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:23.490

01:07:49.690 --> 01:07:53.300
it provides inspiration
and instruction

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:57.390
to foster a nationwide volunteer
effort for individuals to reach

01:07:57.390 --> 01:08:01.560
out to the veterans and their
lives and listen really listen,

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:04.630

histories and personal narrative

01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:08.910
of their veterans from World War
I through the current conflicts.

itself were speaking to me,

My grandfather he worked
daily in the fields,

01:11:53.370 --> 01:11:55.560
he developed the taste of
agriculture from his days

01:11:55.560 --> 01:12:01.460

his hands in the earth.

I sometimes catch him,
working in the field smiling

as he finally achieved
something,

01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:14.760
he'd get up at 4:00 a.m., and
he wouldn't come in to sundown

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:23.620
and then he'd just sit by
the fire, he'd just stare.

01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:29.370
He seemed to prefer the silence,

01:12:29.370 --> 01:12:35.720
my mother told me he had led
the great invasion of the canon

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:38.900
and he had fought many,
many great battles.

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:52.140
One day after dinner I kneel
down by him and I asked him,

01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:56.320
I said "grandfather
please, tell me what it's

01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:06.800
like to really fight in
war, to experience battle",

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:10.530
he turned to me with
his blue eyes of his

01:13:10.530 --> 01:13:17.850
and he said "truly splintered.

blasting everywhere,

the dead and the air resounds

advice, and I went ahead,

had been replaced

by a less experienced
pilot and the cause

01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:08.750
of the crash was unknown,
how were you hit by an enemy,

hit a pole or something.

He also told me how you men
were like sitting ducks,

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:19.670
they would send you men out in
the open to draw the enemy out

01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:22.570
and then they send in the planes

about 34 to 36 of us with our
company command in the middle,

like a, like dominoes.

01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:49.560
in the exact way how you're
told how to do these exercises,

over the beginning.

chicken tenders.

at us like we belong

know about the military just

01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:49.770
from what they see
in movies and stuff

it's kind of cool

fires guns and stuff like that.

this is legal but I'm trying

had the opportunity

to trade the mental wound that
he suffer in Iraq for the bullet

01:44:44.570 --> 01:44:47.660

would I trade it?

01:44:51.530 --> 01:44:55.100
I just hated to see him
suffer the way you did.

01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:56.730
I remember when he came
back I really thought

01:44:56.730 --> 01:45:02.330
that that was a new chapter,
that was a new beginning for him

01:45:02.330 --> 01:45:04.180
but soon, after he came back,

01:45:04.180 --> 01:45:05.820
I realize that he was
far from unscathed.

01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:09.370
That the wounds he didn't
understand, was starting

01:45:09.370 --> 01:45:15.560
to terrify him and the rest of
us, his, his body had returned

01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:17.630

He had become someone we've
never even seen before.

It was on the first
anniversary of the Iraq War.

01:45:24.930 --> 01:45:28.180
He and his girlfriend were
supposed to go to Vermont

01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:33.410
to celebrate and for some reason
they had a tremendous fight

01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:37.640
and he became really
depressed and he came back home

01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:38.940
and he stayed with us.

01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:41.830
And he was sitting in the
living room staring at the fire

01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:44.000
in the fireplace, I'd
go up to him and say,

01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:47.380
"son let's go let's go to
the VA and get some help"

01:45:47.380 --> 01:45:53.560
and he always reply with
"I can't go Dad, I'm sorry,

01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:58.330
I just can't go, nothing matters
to me anymore I'm sorry, sorry".

01:45:58.330 --> 01:46:07.120
He was so terrified of the
stigma he didn't want his unit

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:15.830
to see him as weak, that night
he came to me he asked me if,

01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:18.410
if you can sit in my lap and if
we can rock together like we did

01:46:18.410 --> 01:46:20.710
when he was a little boy.

01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:26.360
I felt lost and I felt
confused, but I said,

01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:32.560
"of course you can son,
of course you can".

01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:40.080
So, here I had this
marine, sitting in my lap

01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:48.530
and I told him how much I
loved him and how much I,

01:46:48.530 --> 01:46:53.890
how proud I was of him
and I begin to rock him,

01:46:53.890 --> 01:47:02.280
and it felt natural
holding my little boy again.

01:47:05.890 --> 01:47:08.640
I thought he was coming
back to us that night.

01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:10.360
We both went to bed
and I slept peacefully

01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:12.270
for the first time

01:47:12.270 --> 01:47:20.840
You know, when your little ones
grow up, they never really grow

them the same way you did

01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:27.440
when they were first born.

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:29.840
The next morning I went to
his room to knock on the door

01:47:29.840 --> 01:47:36.480
and the door was locked,
"hey Jeff open up son,

01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:46.940

be the last time I would hold

01:47:46.940 --> 01:47:50.920

01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:57.030
Would I ask if he would
have a, a quicker death?

01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:59.040
I would have just asked
him to have a good life.

01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:03.790
I remember at the funeral
cursing God "why did you give it

01:48:03.790 --> 01:48:08.140
to us if you were going to
let him suffer so much?"

01:48:08.140 --> 01:48:09.700
I wish I could put my
arms around him and say,

01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:11.870
"Son let's go, get some
help, not only for you

01:48:11.870 --> 01:48:16.290
but for the both of us".

01:48:16.290 --> 01:48:20.920

we become his, his voice,

about the mistakes we made

if he's thinking, "I don't
like the way my dad looks now".

a limb is how you see yourself

Adam was struck by an IED and
was killed in Afghanistan.

We had this guy in the battalion
that can play the bagpipes

and our start major found
out so unfortunately for him,

02:05:42.630 --> 02:05:43.930
he had to pay the bagpipe

had in Afghanistan.

because he was really good

something extraordinary moving

you kind of wish you were.

Adam had attended ranger school,
and he had been there for 7

02:06:11.010 --> 02:06:14.950
or 8 months and he was about
to finish, but he got dropped.

about the Ranger tag,

anybody that doesn't have it.

it well, you get past.

recognition that he was more

So, I, Long story short is,

02:10:01.170 --> 02:10:03.620
I have incredible
empathy for the veterans.

02:10:03.620 --> 02:10:08.450
So, I started creating letters
about 8 years ago when a lot

02:10:08.450 --> 02:10:12.290
of our men and women were coming
back with severe PTSD and a lot

02:10:12.290 --> 02:10:14.870
of stories were in the
newspaper especially about guys

02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:16.960
who couldn't work
and pay their bills.

02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:20.390
That really seem to
pull on my, my strings.

02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:23.440
So, I wanted as an artist,
I wanted to do something

02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:24.740
to give back, I wanted people

02:10:24.740 --> 02:10:28.870
to really understand what
commitment really meant

02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:32.190
so I started creating
these letters and,

02:10:32.190 --> 02:10:33.630
and I started work shopping.

02:10:33.630 --> 02:10:37.450
It you know up front of friends
and this shows changed a lot

02:10:37.450 --> 02:10:39.790
from when I started
like seven years ago,

02:10:39.790 --> 02:10:44.250
but people kept saying
"you got to keep going,

02:10:44.250 --> 02:10:46.100
I think you're on to something".

02:10:46.100 --> 02:10:50.240
So, long story short I, I
found the director Patrick,

02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:53.250
I don't know he's here and
there is, and I said, "you know,

02:10:53.250 --> 02:10:55.510
I got a bunch of
letters from soldiers,

02:10:55.510 --> 02:10:58.100
you want to work
on this with me?"

02:10:58.100 --> 02:11:00.020

him and he kind of liked I

02:11:00.020 --> 02:11:02.580
and he said "I think we're on to
something" so we put it together

02:11:02.580 --> 02:11:07.470
and we kind of created
the show and I kind of,

02:11:07.470 --> 02:11:08.960

final structure

02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:12.580

to, to Al Pacino.

02:13:19.130 --> 02:13:21.600
I mean, who's the
who's of actors,

02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:25.000
and his classes were really
great because we always worked

02:13:25.000 --> 02:13:27.320
on character and you had to
do a monologue and you had

02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:30.820
to create this guy or this
girl or whatever, and,

02:13:30.820 --> 02:13:34.320
and you had to find the
dialect in the behavior in the

02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:35.690
with everything about them.

02:13:35.690 --> 02:13:39.800
So, his training really led me
into this type of work because,

02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:41.700
in many ways this
is what I'm doing.

02:13:41.700 --> 02:13:44.480
I'm finding out who the
guy is, how does he talk,

02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:47.730
how does he walk,
what, what are his his,

02:13:47.730 --> 02:13:49.930
his, his speech patterns.

02:13:49.930 --> 02:13:52.710

that's really where my training

02:13:52.710 --> 02:13:54.010
and he's Meisner based.

know anything about acting

tell their own stories.

and it's been really powerful

02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:13.880
for them because it's
allowed them to basic,

02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:23.520
for Thomas Edison Military
Academy based on it.

02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:28.560
But they need to talk and
what happens is when you go

02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:33.170
into the military your kind
of revved up to be a warrior

02:15:33.170 --> 02:15:36.190
and destroy all your
vulnerabilities,

02:15:36.190 --> 02:15:38.020
because your vulnerabilities
don't help you

02:15:38.020 --> 02:15:40.060
as a soldier in battle.

02:15:40.060 --> 02:15:43.790
But when you come back, you
need those vulnerabilities

02:15:43.790 --> 02:15:47.150
as a human being to say,
"I'm hurting right now".

02:15:47.150 --> 02:15:50.630
But they're so conditioned
to not be vulnerable

02:15:50.630 --> 02:15:54.200
that they don't know how to
express themselves anymore,

02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:56.240
and that's when the
problem comes because,

02:15:56.240 --> 02:15:59.320
they carry all this stuff
inside and they start,

02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:00.930
they struggle with it.

02:16:00.930 --> 02:16:05.240
And some more than others,
but the ones that can talk

02:16:05.240 --> 02:16:07.160
about it tend to seem to
really help themselves.

02:16:07.160 --> 02:16:08.750
But therapy, I mean theater

02:16:08.750 --> 02:16:12.110
and horse therapy it's
been some two new versions

02:16:12.110 --> 02:16:13.410
that have been popping up.

02:16:13.410 --> 02:16:18.940
The military is even
looking into the theater

02:16:18.940 --> 02:16:27.210
and I did the show in Kansas
for about 300 Vietnam veterans

02:16:27.210 --> 02:16:30.790
and afterward we, we have some
great stories but they all said,

02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:36.170
"it's so cathartic to hear your
stories because it allows me

02:16:36.170 --> 02:16:39.250
to talk about them and it's the
first time that I've been able

02:16:39.250 --> 02:16:42.620
to express them" so, but yes.

02:16:42.620 --> 02:16:46.200
I mean, just for everybody
to know the only 1%

02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:50.240
of our population serve, and
so we put a tremendous amount

02:16:50.240 --> 02:16:53.070
of demand on those
guys, men and women.

02:16:53.070 --> 02:16:58.510
So, it's just good for
us to remember that 1%

02:16:58.510 --> 02:17:02.300
of our population is
our fighting force so.

02:17:02.300 --> 02:17:04.430
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Doug I want
to thank you again, awesome,

02:17:04.430 --> 02:17:07.960
and I just learned a quick
commercial that Doug's going

02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:11.640
to be back up for Memorial
Day, so I would ask between now

02:17:11.640 --> 02:17:13.190
and then you think
about who the veteran

02:17:13.190 --> 02:17:15.210
in your life or community is.

02:17:15.210 --> 02:17:17.940
And as Doug said they they're
out there, they need to talk,

02:17:17.940 --> 02:17:20.370
they don't always
realize they need to talk,

02:17:20.370 --> 02:17:22.400
and don't ask them the
hard question just ask them

02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:24.050
"wow what was it like?"

02:17:24.050 --> 02:17:27.150
Let them come up with the, with
the, with the downside but,

02:17:27.150 --> 02:17:29.390
but ask him those questions
about what was the food?

02:17:29.390 --> 02:17:31.120
Like what was the best part?

02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:33.790
Or perhaps you know, what
were your instructors like?

02:17:33.790 --> 02:17:37.000
To get them talking and I
will tell you as a veteran,

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:41.580
I didn't think I had a story and
I had a good interviewer and we,

02:17:41.580 --> 02:17:44.490
at The Veterans History Project,
we teach how to interview.

02:17:44.490 --> 02:17:47.800
In fact, there's a class
going on right now, and so,

02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:50.730
think about reaching out to
The Veterans History Project

02:17:50.730 --> 02:17:54.210
to help us teach
you how to interview

02:17:54.210 --> 02:17:57.370
so that you can interview
that veteran in your life.

02:17:57.370 --> 02:17:59.800
So, again Doug thank
you so much for coming,

02:17:59.800 --> 02:18:01.950
I would like to thank everybody
in the audience for coming

02:18:01.950 --> 02:18:04.120
as well for making
this just a really.

02:18:04.120 --> 02:18:07.590
&gt;&gt; Douglas Taurel: Please share
it on Twitter and Facebook --

02:18:07.590 --> 02:18:08.890
&gt;&gt; Karen Lloyd: Yes.

02:18:08.890 --> 02:18:10.190
&gt;&gt; Douglas Taurel: Or tag
me and I have a website

02:18:10.190 --> 02:18:12.430

but use the American
Soldier as a tag.

02:18:14.600 --> 02:18:17.330

more I can keep doing this show,

02:18:17.330 --> 02:18:21.000
