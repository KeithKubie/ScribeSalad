00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.790
Stack views are a new UI element.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.450
Introduced in IOS 9 and
as the name suggests,

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.119
they make it easy to stack views.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:12.012
You can have any UI view
sub-class inside a UI stack view.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:12.840
In PagePerfect,

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.390
we're going to place our play back
buttons inside a set of stacked views.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.280
Stack views can have either
a horizontal or vertical orientation.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.120
You can control the alignment,
distribution and

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.660
spacing of a stack view.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.340
Stack views can be nested
inside each other.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.390
Here you can see a vertical
stack view for the entire screen

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.870
with horizontal stack views nested
inside for each row of buttons.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.600
The real beauty in using stack
views is that you only need to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.250
create our layout constraints for
the stack views.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.990
What about all the UI elements
inside the stack view,

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.050
like are buttons in PagePerfect?

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.010
The stack views create their own
outer layout constraints for

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.890
all the UI elements contained in them
based on the alignment, distribution and

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.410
spacing settings you provide.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.590
Let that sink in for a second.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.280
Instead of having to create our layout
constraints for all these buttons

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.510
we can just embed them in UI stock
views and let them do the work.
