00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Here's my solution. First, I use randint to assign the true location of the car.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
My initial guess, called guess1, is also chosen at random.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You see these independent random choices with equal probability.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now there are two possibilities. Either truth is equivalent to guess or it isn't.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
When truth is equivalent to guess, Monty will pick one of the two other doors.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let's just implement this. I will let Monty pick a random door using randint.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Of course, he might have picked the correct door, which contains the car,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
which is also my guess, and when that's the case I just rerun the random number generator

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
until it finally finds a door that is not the true door or equivalently not the guess.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
That this pick. If we look carefully, this might run a number of times.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But when it returns, he picked one of the remaining doors at 50% chance.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In the else clause, the truth and my guess are not the same.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So, Monty now has to pick the remaining door with probability 1.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
How do we get get Monty's choice?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now I'm going to do a little cute trick.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I know that the sum of all doors--1 + 2 + 3--equals 6.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
If I subtract from 6 the truth and my guess, I get the third door.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This equation--6 - truth - guess--will give us the number of the door that isn't truth

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and isn't guess 1.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
To flip my door, I can now do the same trick I did over here.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I pick the one that wasn't my initial guess, which is subtract guess1 from 6,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
pick the one that isn't Monty. That gives me guess 2.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
If that guess is the same as the 2 door, I increment k by 1.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Then I return the final number over here.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This gives me a single simulation.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I run through this n times.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So, I added a loop for i in range n, move everything to the right a little bit,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and then this simulation is run n times,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
returning my desired ratio of the successes over the total number of experiments.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Let's run it.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
When I run it 1000 times, I get a number like 0.672.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
That's not exactly 2.3, but obviously there is some randomness involved in the simulation.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
If I increase N to 10,000, I get a number slightly closer to 0.66.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Do it 400,000, I get 0.66748.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
That is awfully close to 2/3.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It's really interesting to see that the switching helps.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Put differently, say I use guess1 as my final guess to compare to the truth

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
as opposed to guess2 and run this.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I get 0.331.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The interesting thing about guess1 is--the reason why it works is--

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
all the code from if truth all the way to here--guess2--is now irrelevant.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I can comment all of this out here in the middle, which I've just done,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and just retain the assignment of the truth, which is a random number,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the assignment of guess1, which is a random number,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and then I just check where these two agree.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Clearly, the probability must be a 1/3.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
All this story about showing the open door has no effect on this.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
That little thing here that I simulated and when I retained the original guess

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
then all the story about opening the door has no effect on the chances of my guess,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
prove that the chance is to be 1/3 for the original door.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Therefore, switching goes up to 2/3.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Isn't that cool?

00:03:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This is the story of Monty Hall and the very famous quiz.
