00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.089
SPEAKER: Google Maps
offers you a wealth of data

00:00:02.089 --> 00:00:04.510
for building
location-aware apps.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.050
Let's take a look at a solution
for location-aware apps,

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.622
a transport tracker.

00:00:08.622 --> 00:00:10.260
This gives you a
complete solution

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.960
for understanding where your
various vehicles, such as buses

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.740
or trucks, are at
any given time.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.520
What does a system for
transport tracking look like?

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.810
Well, first of all, there
are the vehicles themselves.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.370
You need to understand how
to report on their location,

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.560
how to store their
location in a database,

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.410
and get real-time updates
from that database.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.910
How to display the
vehicle locations

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.970
on a map, how to style
that map, and how

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.016
to administer the whole system.

00:00:35.016 --> 00:00:36.890
The Transport Tracker
solution will teach you

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.260
how to build all of this,
including the map where

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.690
all of your assets
are, a mobile app that

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.970
reports on the location
of the vehicles,

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.630
and the back end that
ties everything together.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.000
In particular, the back end
receives real-time updates

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.700
of the vehicle locations and
sets up the display panels

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.560
for use by the front end.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.870
You'll learn through
tutorials and documentation,

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.005
with a full reference
implementation in open source.

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:00.880
With this, you'll have
the basis for building

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.220
any kind of asset-tracking
solution using

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.100
the full suite of tools
available for Google Maps.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.470
