[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.190
SPEAKER: I'm so excited
to introduce our guests.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.940
Boyz II Men remains one of the
most truly iconic R&amp;B groups

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.020
in history.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.550
The trio, which includes Nathan
Morris, Wanya Morris, and Shawn

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.490
Stockman, who will be
with us in just a moment,

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.240
hold the distinction of
being the best-selling R&amp;B

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.110
group of all time.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.310
Let's give them a huge
round of applause.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.470

and Casino in Vegas, which
has been going since 2013.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.190
Boyz II Men's world
famous hits include--

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.810
(SINGING) End of the road.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.790
(SPOKEN) OK, I won't do it.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:10.870
I digress.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.090
"End of the Road,"
"I'll Make Love

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.550
to You," "Motown Philly,"
and "One Sweet Day,"

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.720
among many others.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.620
The soundtrack of my
childhood, as I tell my age.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.210
A collaboration
with Mariah Carey

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.150
that still holds the all-time
record for most number

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.910
of weeks on the
Billboard Hot 100.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.760
Boyz II Men have won
fans over the world

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.050
with their soulful multi-octave
sound and incredible vocals.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.170
Given the monumental
success of their albums

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.030
and the timeless
quality of their vocals,

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.600
it's easy to see why Boyz II
Men remains the most popular R&amp;B

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.610
group of all time.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.400
Beyond making music, they
give back to their community,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.830
and they are here today
to celebrate and speak

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:54.640
with each of us.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.470
Additionally, we're
honored to have

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.280
Boyz II Men's manager, Joe
Mulvihill, joining us today,

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.450
as well.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.960
Joe is a 25-year veteran of
the entertainment industry,

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.750
having worked as a--

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.729
OK, Joe!

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.860
I'm sorry in advance.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.360
He's getting clowned
from backstage,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.310
and you'll see why in a moment.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.010
Joe is a 25-year veteran of
the entertainment industry,

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.740
having worked as a host,
performer, producer, director--

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.760
OK, that's enough.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.258
Let's bring our
Boyz II Men and Joe!

00:02:24.258 --> 00:02:26.214
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:34.527 --> 00:02:35.994
Hi, Joe.

00:02:35.994 --> 00:02:37.461
It's going to be a long day.

00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:38.928
WANYA MORRIS: Yeah.

00:02:38.928 --> 00:02:40.612
This guy.

00:02:40.612 --> 00:02:41.862
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Hi, everybody.

00:02:41.862 --> 00:02:43.330
WANYA MORRIS: Hello.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.991
How are you?

00:02:43.991 --> 00:02:46.240
NATHAN MORRIS: Hello, hello,
hello, hello in the back.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.250
How are you?

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.800
SPEAKER: So guys, first, we
want to give you a big welcome

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.430
to Google.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.170
I can honestly say
that I'm sitting here,

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.628
and I would imagine
that many of us

00:02:54.628 --> 00:02:58.210
are because of the true impact
you've had in our lives,

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.270
in our careers by just
seeing the example that you

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.050
made across the globe,
as far as representation.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.360
So first, just want to kick
it off to you on who is

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.820
Boyz II Men?

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.000
Like, where are you today?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.530
What makes you tick?

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.515
WANYA MORRIS: Man.

00:03:13.515 --> 00:03:14.723
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Yeah, go, go.

00:03:14.723 --> 00:03:18.840
WANYA MORRIS: Well,
honestly, Boyz II Men--

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.410
we represent music.

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.150
Real music.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.760
We try our best to maintain
the integrity of music

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.960
throughout our careers.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.900
We went to the high school for
creative and performing arts,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.840
and that's what we
went to school for.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.600
I barely got out of it--

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.440
barely got out of school
just because all I

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:42.730
wanted to do was sing with these
guys, and being choir majors--

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.650
vocal choir majors-- we actually
would be around each other.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.060
So we kind of formulated
somewhat of a place

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.924
where we belonged vocally
without knowing that we

00:03:51.924 --> 00:03:53.090
were going to sing together.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.350
And once we decided
to get in the room--

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.750
and Nate will probably
tell you the story

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.290
and how it all came about--
but once we got into a room

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.310
and actually started
singing harmonies,

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.170
it was something that
we couldn't let go of.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.750
It was almost like a drug.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.049
It was like a high.

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.840
It was like the best
sex that you ever had.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.450
You know what I'm saying?

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.410
Honestly, I mean.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.899
But that's what harmony
does, you know what I mean?

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:23.320
When you're creating
it, like we often say,

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.779
music comes out of our throats.

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:25.820
You know what I'm saying?

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.580
And it comes together and it
becomes something so magical

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.470
that you can't forget
and you always want it.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.760
You're chasing that actual
perfect harmony, and Boyz II

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.600
Men--

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.560
we are music.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.030
That's how we feel about it.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.695
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Basically,
we're harmony crackheads.

00:04:42.695 --> 00:04:43.680
Is that what you said?

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.520
WANYA MORRIS:
Harmony crackheads.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.603
SHAWN STOCKMAN: All right.

00:04:45.603 --> 00:04:46.540
Thank you.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.390
SPEAKER: So talk to us a
little bit about the journey.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.110
We always see-- I always give
the example of Instagram.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.240
It's like the
highlight reel, right?

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.060
But we all know that to get and
reach your level of success,

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.420
there had to be some hardship.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.612
So curious to know if you
could share with us some

00:05:01.612 --> 00:05:03.820
of the struggles that you're
comfortable with sharing

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.390
so we, too, can kind of navigate
those moments in our life.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.550
NATHAN MORRIS: Well, we actually
started as a group that you

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.780
know now in, I'd say, '90,
'91-ish that the world knows.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.330
And obviously, coming
out of high school,

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.830
we jumped out pretty fast.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.645
Things went very well for
us and success was great.

00:05:24.645 --> 00:05:26.710
The first three or four
years went very well,

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.230
and then things kind
of got a little fishy.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.150
Us being young, learning
the industry as teenagers,

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.022
not quite soaking in
all the information

00:05:36.022 --> 00:05:37.480
that we probably
needed to soak in.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.026
And not knowing enough about
the business to know that,

00:05:41.026 --> 00:05:42.400
unfortunately,
the music industry

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.730
was built on the shoulders
of mobsters and people

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:48.820
like that who
weren't 100% honest.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.420
We, coming from Philadelphia,
being taught that whatever you

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.943
work for, you get like that.

00:05:52.943 --> 00:05:53.630
SPEAKER: Philly in the house.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.213
NATHAN MORRIS: We,
coming from Philly,

00:05:55.213 --> 00:05:58.060
being taught that when
you work hard, you win.

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.760
And then you get into a
business that kind of flips it

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.480
on you that when you work hard,
things don't always pan out.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.697
So to make a long story
short, things didn't always

00:06:06.697 --> 00:06:08.530
go well for us, and the
middle of our career

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:10.410
kind of dipped down.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:12.520
And we kind of
only had ourselves

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.172
as a group to rely on because
everyone else around us, we

00:06:15.172 --> 00:06:17.380
started to realize, were
strictly around us to either

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.910
better themselves
or make more money

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.070
or not give us enough
information for us

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.360
to move forward.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.872
So we kind of fell on
each other's shoulders.

00:06:24.872 --> 00:06:26.830
We tried to figure out
how to fight through it.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.350
I mean obviously, you guys
see there's one member missing

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.950
from the original group.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.000
That was one of the hardships
that we kind of went through--

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.010
something that we were
able to bounce back from.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.360
And we all grew up together.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.510
We talk about it now--

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.747
that 27 years in, we've
probably spent more time

00:06:41.747 --> 00:06:43.330
on the road with
each other than we've

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.480
spent with our own families.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.146
So we're kind of
closer than we are even

00:06:46.146 --> 00:06:47.740
to some of our family members.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.170
So for our guy to
leave in the way

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.060
that that thing went down for
us, it was a little difficult.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.380
But we knew, like Wan said,
that all we ever wanted to do

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.740
was sing and make great music.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.110
And we weren't going to let
one person stop that show.

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.780
And again, to try
to narrow it down,

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:07.130
because I know we all want to
talk, there's always hardships.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.276
And I think the key is figuring
out where you want to be

00:07:11.276 --> 00:07:13.150
and how you dig out the
place that you're in.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:16.180
I'm a big believer
in trying your best

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.044
to control what you can
control, and don't stress out

00:07:19.044 --> 00:07:20.710
about the things that
you can't control.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:23.434
And we kind of took
that moniker as things

00:07:23.434 --> 00:07:24.850
weren't going well
to just do what

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:28.030
we could do, and let everything
else fall where it went.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.990
And 27 years later,
we're still able to be

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.880
successful at what we're doing.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.826
SPEAKER: Amazing.

00:07:32.826 --> 00:07:33.326
Yes.

00:07:33.326 --> 00:07:35.278
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.270
As we sit here on the
Google campus surrounded

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.090
by a room of innovators,
curious to know--

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:46.680
we see where you are now
and the 27-year, huge career

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.370
that you've had.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:49.410
But curious to know
about the breakthrough.

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:53.520
What was the moment that you
knew, wow, this thing is big?

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.960
This thing is really working
and it's time for us to scale.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.260
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Wow.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.740
It's hard to pinpoint
a defining moment

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.740
because I lie to you not--

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:14.010
we got together
sometime in 1989,

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.800
and six months later,
we were discovered.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.040
And then a year later, we
put out our first record.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.860
And then it just went shoo.

00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:24.030
But it was really just
one of those things

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:27.300
where it had to be kismet
because it was just

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.790
one of those things where
everything just kind

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.027
of happened.

00:08:31.027 --> 00:08:32.360
WANYA MORRIS: The stars aligned.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.526
SHAWN STOCKMAN: The stars
completely aligned for us.

00:08:34.526 --> 00:08:37.580
So I would say from--

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.740
OK, I'll say one moment.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.045
We call it the magic show.

00:08:42.045 --> 00:08:43.570
WANYA MORRIS: Oh yeah.

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:48.130
SHAWN STOCKMAN: It
was February of 1989.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.380
WANYA MORRIS: Valentine's Day.

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.220
SHAWN STOCKMAN:
Valentine's Day, right?

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.765
I like to tell this story
mainly because I think out

00:08:54.765 --> 00:08:56.430
of everybody in the
group, it affected

00:08:56.430 --> 00:09:00.690
me the most because I was kind
of the introvert geek nerd

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:01.730
dude.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:03.650
I was probably one of
the only black dudes

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:06.569
that listened to
metal music and--

00:09:06.569 --> 00:09:07.860
WANYA MORRIS: Read comic books.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:09.617
SHAWN STOCKMAN:
Read comic books.

00:09:09.617 --> 00:09:11.700
WANYA MORRIS: And hung out
with devil worshippers.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.116
SHAWN STOCKMAN: I did not hang
out with devil worshippers.

00:09:14.116 --> 00:09:15.510
NATHAN MORRIS: A little bit.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:19.200
SHAWN STOCKMAN: So
I joined this group.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:25.080
We put together this show
for a talent show that--

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.560
like an assembly show
that we have every year.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.750
And we went to school with
guys like The Roots and people

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:31.250
like that.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.630
So let me tell you something.

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.540
Our talent shows were worth
the price of admission.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.830
Like, we had some of
the baddest musicians,

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.080
singers in the country.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.630
So anyway, the curtains
are drawn open.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:47.884
We're standing there
in these sequins.

00:09:47.884 --> 00:09:49.050
WANYA MORRIS: Two-for suits.

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:49.365
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Jackets.

00:09:49.365 --> 00:09:50.400
WANYA MORRIS: No, no.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.080
White jackets.

00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:52.455
SHAWN STOCKMAN:
Oh, white jackets

00:09:52.455 --> 00:09:55.980
with these black pleather
shoes and the whole nine--

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.644
now mind you, we've
gone to this school

00:09:57.644 --> 00:09:58.810
for a few years, some of us.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:09:59.643
NATHAN MORRIS: Yeah.

00:09:59.643 --> 00:10:01.830
SHAWN STOCKMAN: And kids--

00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:02.990
they've seen us around.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.260
You know, no big deal.

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:07.110
When they open the
curtain, the girls

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.450
screamed like we
were New Edition.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:14.370
And so much so--

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:15.137
no, really.

00:10:15.137 --> 00:10:16.470
They were falling out the chair.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.810
But we didn't sing a note.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:20.490
WANYA MORRIS: Not one note.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:22.880
SHAWN STOCKMAN: And
the principal had to--

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.349
hey, you guys, stop.

00:10:24.349 --> 00:10:25.390
And all this other stuff.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.840
So we're standing there
in our little poses.

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.298
WANYA MORRIS: Still
standing there.

00:10:30.774 --> 00:10:32.190
NATHAN MORRIS:
Getting leg cramps.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:33.106
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Right?

00:10:33.106 --> 00:10:35.337
While the principal is
talking, I'm like, damn.

00:10:35.337 --> 00:10:36.670
Will she just hurry the hell up?

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.540
I got sparkles in my hand.

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.670
We had a whole routine.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.400
To make a long story
short, we did the show.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.650
The next day-- again,
I was an introvert.

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.090
Nobody knew me.

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.400
The next day, I go to my locker.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.000
Hey, Shawn.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.580
Hey, Shawn.

00:10:50.580 --> 00:10:51.080
Shawn.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.040
Hey, Shawn.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:52.540
Shawn!

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.430
Hey, Shawn, what up, dog?

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:58.637
And it screwed with me a
little bit because I was like,

00:10:58.637 --> 00:10:59.220
wait a minute.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.261
NATHAN MORRIS: Overnight.

00:11:00.261 --> 00:11:02.560
SHAWN STOCKMAN:
Overnight, literally.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.090
So it was one of those things
where it was like, wow, this

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:06.410
is something special.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:08.510
And this was before we
even got discovered.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:12.260
So even then, I
felt like this was

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.550
something of some other
plane, spiritually.

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:20.930
Like this was just some other
entity, and honestly, not

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.590
trying to make it melodramatic,
but that's really what it was.

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:28.630
So to define it, I guess
that was the defining moment.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.500
I knew from that
point that I wanted

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.395
to be a singer in this group.

00:11:32.395 --> 00:11:33.770
JOE MULVIHILL:
Shawn, real quick,

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.750
tell them the story about
when they dressed up--

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.030
when you guys dressed up in bow
ties and that whole concept,

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.610
and you thought--

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:39.440
SHAWN STOCKMAN: They
could tell that story.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.600
JOE MULVIHILL: And it
was a little ridiculous.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.230
SHAWN STOCKMAN: All
right, I'll set it up.

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.870
I'll set it up.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:46.380
All right, so when
we got discovered

00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.170
and Michael Bivins
of New Edition

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:51.670
discovered us and we got
the deal, record's done,

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.314
went to the photo shoot, and--

00:11:53.314 --> 00:11:54.605
NATHAN MORRIS: It was horrible.

00:11:54.605 --> 00:11:56.063
SHAWN STOCKMAN:
Yeah, the first one

00:11:56.063 --> 00:11:58.460
was bad because we kind of
looked like everybody else.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.140
We had the baseball caps
and the parka jackets

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.410
and the Timberland boots
and things of that nature.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:04.697
And Biv had the vision.

00:12:04.697 --> 00:12:06.530
He was like, you know,
that just ain't them.

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.150
NATHAN MORRIS: He had a kind
of a vision, but go ahead.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:09.649
SHAWN STOCKMAN:
Yeah, well you know.

00:12:09.649 --> 00:12:11.150
It was a work in
progress, but he

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.560
was like, see, what I
want you all to do, right.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.970
Because we were going to do
this showcase for Motown Records

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:17.990
in Los Angeles.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:19.244
So he had an idea--

00:12:19.244 --> 00:12:20.410
WANYA MORRIS: In the office.

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:22.220
SHAWN STOCKMAN: In
the offices of Motown.

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:24.110
NATHAN MORRIS: Get them
to underlayment, too.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:26.330
The thing in the music
industry, period,

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.759
is that whether you have
good music or whatever,

00:12:28.759 --> 00:12:30.800
you always have to have
some kind of gimmick or--

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.060
I don't like to say gimmick--
or some kind of identity

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.560
or something that separates you
from everybody else in order

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:36.770
for you to be successful.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.080
And after we finished
our first album,

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:40.700
they really had no identity.

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.520
They had us singing
harmonies in an era

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.290
that groups weren't
really doing that.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.720
Doing a capella stuff that
groups weren't really doing,

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.450
so they couldn't figure
out an image for the group.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:53.130
So Mike came up with
this brilliant plan.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:53.920
Go, Shawn.

00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.700
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Right.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.590
So he took us to the mall.

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.514
WANYA MORRIS: Nope,
nope, no, no, no, no.

00:12:59.514 --> 00:13:00.930
SHAWN STOCKMAN:
No, what happened?

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:01.370
What happened?

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:01.730
What?

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.355
NATHAN MORRIS: That
was after the fact.

00:13:03.355 --> 00:13:05.310
WANYA MORRIS: He told
us, go to the mall.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:06.330
SHAWN STOCKMAN:
Oh, right, right.

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:07.316
Go to the mall, right.

00:13:07.316 --> 00:13:09.930
NATHAN MORRIS: He said, buy some
sweaters, buy some bow ties.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:10.370
WANYA MORRIS: It
ain't got to match.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:11.210
Nothing ain't got to match.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:12.130
NATHAN MORRIS: Get some jeans.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:13.260
Well, what color should--

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.370
don't worry about it.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:15.440
Nothing has to match.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:16.850
Just go grab some stuff.

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.550
WANYA MORRIS: Bow
ties, sweaters.

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:20.486
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Colors, pastels.

00:13:20.486 --> 00:13:21.110
The whole nine.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:22.700
So we bought this stuff.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.290
We put it on.

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:25.825
We were walking down--

00:13:25.825 --> 00:13:26.450
no, no, no, no.

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:27.530
I'm trying to give
them the short.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:29.810
I'm trying to give them
the short, abridged, that--

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:32.402
so we're walking on down
Sunset to this place

00:13:32.402 --> 00:13:34.860
called Pink Dot, where they
made like sandwiches and stuff.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.915
NATHAN MORRIS: And Wanya's
comment to me was--

00:13:36.915 --> 00:13:37.790
SHAWN STOCKMAN: What?

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:38.940
NATHAN MORRIS: Oh, man.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.190
People are looking at us, man.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.481
These outfits must really work.

00:13:41.481 --> 00:13:42.629
I said, no, dude.

00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:44.795
They're looking at us because
we look like assholes.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.170
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Oh,
it was horrible.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:49.836
It was horrible.

00:13:49.836 --> 00:13:51.285
NATHAN MORRIS: Like Life Savers.

00:13:51.285 --> 00:13:52.160
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Yeah.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:52.540
For real.

00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:53.120
For real.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:53.820
It was awful.

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:54.680
So all right.

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.240
So we get our sandwiches.

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.640
We get laughed at by
the passersby on Sunset.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.425
WANYA MORRIS:
Beeping their horns.

00:13:59.425 --> 00:14:00.380
SHAWN STOCKMAN:
Laughing and whatnot.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.320
It was hilarious.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.650
So we go to the
office at Motown.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.144
They start laughing, right?

00:14:06.144 --> 00:14:06.810
Laughing, right?

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:07.160
NATHAN MORRIS: First
time they ever saw us.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.670
SHAWN STOCKMAN: First time they
ever saw us, and they're like,

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:10.460
what the hell are--

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:11.810
like, just crazy.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:12.950
So we start dancing.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:14.240
We start singing.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.282
Yeah, all that.

00:14:15.282 --> 00:14:16.490
NATHAN MORRIS: In the office.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:17.410
SHAWN STOCKMAN: In the office.

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:18.650
In the small little section.

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:21.000
We gave it our South Park best.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.855
And after that, we left
and it was kind of like--

00:14:24.855 --> 00:14:27.230
NATHAN MORRIS: The president
of Motown called Mike Bivins

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.850
and told him that you've
got to figure this out.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:29.880
This is not working.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.272
So then the call
was made to go to--

00:14:32.272 --> 00:14:34.480
WANYA MORRIS: Yeah, so then
Mike took us to the mall.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.021
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Mike called,
and yeah, he took us to the mall

00:14:37.021 --> 00:14:38.510
and he got us these outfits.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:39.130
NATHAN MORRIS: That matched.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:39.530
WANYA MORRIS: The sweaters--

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:40.175
SHAWN STOCKMAN: That matched.

00:14:40.175 --> 00:14:40.675
Right.

00:14:40.675 --> 00:14:41.744
That matched.

00:14:41.744 --> 00:14:43.660
The sweaters that you
see in "Motown Philly--"

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.240
that was the shopping mall.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.220
NATHAN MORRIS: The ones
that are on the cover.

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.680
Those white sweaters, those
red bow ties, and the hats

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.780
are the second
"Cooleyhighharmony" cover.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:51.310
WANYA MORRIS: He
hooked us up because we

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:53.510
had outfits to wear on
the shows and everything.

00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.600
So we understood what
the Alex Vanderpool--

00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.700
because that's what it
was called at the time--

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:01.250
we understood what
the Alex Vanderpool

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:04.855
concept was once he took us
to the mall and hooked us up.

00:15:04.855 --> 00:15:06.230
SHAWN STOCKMAN:
Yeah, but it went

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.140
through a really bad stage.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.890
NATHAN MORRIS: Like
the ugly teenage stage

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:11.150
where you don't know what
you're supposed to do.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:11.980
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Oh man.

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:12.860
NATHAN MORRIS: That was us.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.068
SHAWN STOCKMAN: It was awful.

00:15:14.068 --> 00:15:15.600
But it was good times.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.640
SPEAKER: So I'm
curious to know now,

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.550
you look back at how you
began and the grind--

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:25.790
the grit that was required
through those stages.

00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:29.145
And now seeing the huge
role that technology

00:15:29.145 --> 00:15:31.520
is playing in the music industry
and you're seeing people

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.160
get discovered on
YouTube and on Instagram.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:38.570
Wondering your thoughts
on instant or what

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.319
appears to be instant success.

00:15:41.319 --> 00:15:43.610
NATHAN MORRIS: At first, we
used to frown down upon it,

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:47.180
but we realize that you can't
really change the times.

00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:50.420
One thing I will say is that,
no offense to the millennials,

00:15:50.420 --> 00:15:53.200
but our parents always
tell us this, too,

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.370
but we know that if we were able
to have that type of technology

00:15:57.370 --> 00:16:03.250
when we started, because we were
taught to use our imagination

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.350
early, where a lot
of kids today don't--

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:07.780
if they don't push the
button, it doesn't come up.

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:09.820
We were trapped in
our room by ourselves

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:11.500
with a stick and a
horse head on it,

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.240
and we thought we were a knight.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:17.230
So if we had the technology
that we had back then

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.240
with the imagination
that we had,

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.442
this music industry would
be off the charts right now.

00:16:22.442 --> 00:16:24.690
WANYA MORRIS: Well,
the one thing, as well,

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:27.600
when it comes to the
technology aspect of it,

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.790
if it's utilized
right, it can actually

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:33.000
create a growth pattern.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.860
People will see you grow, but
everybody's a star right away,

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:37.900
you know what I mean?

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.430
Because it's so put out there
to be this type of way--

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:45.030
got this gold chain and his
hat to the back and Kiki,

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.919
do you love me?

00:16:45.919 --> 00:16:46.960
You know what I'm saying?

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.980
You know what I mean?

00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:55.230
So now, everybody's trying
to create what's already been

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:56.640
created, you know what I mean?

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:01.080
And it doesn't help
the imagination

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.820
to become something more--

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.079
something better.

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:09.640
And longevity doesn't thrive
through certain circumstances

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.410
like that.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:14.040
You have to become something
in the beginning for people

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.460
to see you grow to something,
which will create longevity.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.839
And that's kind of like--

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:21.910
I look at it as the
Boyz II Men effect.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.869
I remember coming to
places like-- let's just

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:26.040
say Google, for instance.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.897
It wasn't Google
back then, of course.

00:17:27.897 --> 00:17:29.730
There was no internet,
you know what I mean?

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:31.140
There was no emails.

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.000
There was no Wi-Fi.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.708
SHAWN STOCKMAN: OK,
stop dating us, dude.

00:17:33.708 --> 00:17:37.260
WANYA MORRIS: So we actually had
to go to these radio stations.

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.940
We actually had to shake hands.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:42.040
We had to go to the
distribution companies.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.340
We had to actually
show that we were

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:47.940
able to do what they
saw and heard that we

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:49.200
were doing on these records.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.330
And we went everywhere.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.010
We cultivated
enough for the world

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.880
that after 27
years later, people

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:59.910
can still say today that
Boyz II Men are real,

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:00.960
you know what I mean?

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.370
So there's no technology.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.440
It was just basically organic--

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.650
the purity of music--
of our vocals.

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:10.680
And nowadays, if
people don't utilize it

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:15.870
in a manner to build themselves,
they're going to be here today

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:17.070
and gone today.

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.650
And that's normally what
happens with technology.

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:24.281
And I feel bad because there are
some very talented individuals

00:18:24.281 --> 00:18:24.780
out there.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:29.000
They just are jaded by the
concept of where to start.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.590
NATHAN MORRIS: And I think
the information age helps.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:37.170
I think when you
do the comparison,

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:43.290
it's easier to attain the
avenue to become successful,

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:45.840
but it's a lot harder
to become successful

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.080
because of the information
age and it being

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.530
saturated with just everything.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:57.270
What I mean by that is
years ago, when we came out,

00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:00.600
you only heard about the
artists that you heard.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:04.150
You didn't have access to every
single person on the planet.

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:10.080
In other words, you only knew 50
talented singers in your life.

00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:12.420
Now, you go on the internet--
there's millions of them.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:15.480
So it's kind of watered down to
the point where it's not even

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.690
so much about the talent.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:21.360
It's just way too many people
to let them all be successful.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.470
We were at a time where--
and I hate to date us,

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:26.370
but we had three major channels,
you know what I'm saying?

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:29.430
So if you watched those three
channels, whatever you got,

00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:30.585
you got from there.

00:19:30.585 --> 00:19:32.751
SHAWN STOCKMAN: We had to
get up and turn on the TV.

00:19:32.751 --> 00:19:35.010
NATHAN MORRIS: Now that
there's 10 billion channels,

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:37.580
it's kind of watered down
where everyone's attention--

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.185
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:40.185 --> 00:19:42.560
JOE MULVIHILL: Does anybody
know what he's talking about?

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.578
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:19:43.578 --> 00:19:44.328
NATHAN MORRIS: OK.

00:19:44.328 --> 00:19:45.970
As long as we're
not the only ones.

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:46.886
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Right.

00:19:46.886 --> 00:19:48.810
NATHAN MORRIS: But we
just had to use pliers.

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:53.269
But anyway, it's so watered down
to where-- and then Wan and I

00:19:53.269 --> 00:19:54.810
was talking about
this the other day,

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.720
that you'll hear someone
who's absolutely incredible,

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.160
but now that you have
access to 10,000 people who

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.680
are incredible, how
special are they, really?

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.462
Years ago, we
didn't have access.

00:20:05.462 --> 00:20:06.920
There was always
somebody over here

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.587
that was better
than Boyz II Men.

00:20:08.587 --> 00:20:10.670
Always somebody that was
better than Mariah Carey,

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:11.990
but you didn't know about them.

00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:13.430
But now that you
have connections

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.640
to see and be entertained
by all these people,

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.982
it makes it tougher for
people who are really, really

00:20:18.982 --> 00:20:20.690
talented to be successful
because there's

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:22.972
so many that you can get to.

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:24.680
SPEAKER: So since
we're dating ourselves,

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.035
I might as well just go for it.

00:20:26.035 --> 00:20:26.940
NATHAN MORRIS: All right.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.280
SPEAKER: I turned 40 this year.

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:28.940
NATHAN MORRIS: Nice.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:29.270
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Welcome.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.102
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:20:30.102 --> 00:20:31.350
NATHAN MORRIS: Yeah.

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:32.450
Welcome to the hill.

00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:33.260
SPEAKER: 40's really
sexy, by the way.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.412
SHAWN STOCKMAN:
Welcome to the 40 club.

00:20:34.412 --> 00:20:35.370
SPEAKER: It feels good.

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:36.960
NATHAN MORRIS: We
call it the hill.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.001
It's the bottom of the
hill before you get over--

00:20:39.001 --> 00:20:40.670
SPEAKER: OK, OK.

00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.320
I embrace the hill, then.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.910
And I started my career in the
music industry for 10 years,

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:49.700
and saw music companies
shutting down.

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.080
We know many of them.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.390
Tower Records shutting
down and the industry kind

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:54.710
of crumbling around us.

00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:56.270
And I got out.

00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:57.920
I was afraid, and
I said, you know,

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.500
my livelihood is attached
to this business,

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.170
and if I don't pivot now,
I'm going to sink with it.

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:04.980
That's how I felt at the time.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.650
Looking back, my
question to you is

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:11.720
how have you been able to
have longevity and rebrand

00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:15.620
and even reposition
yourself in such a changing,

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:16.520
evolving climate?

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.640
WANYA MORRIS: Well,
honestly, it was hard.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:23.750
It was very hard, simply
because we started off--

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:28.220
our career was here, and
we were doing so well.

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:32.330
And we felt like at that time,
when the music industry was

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:36.030
changing, that we could actually
take a couple of years off.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.130
Just relax a little bit.

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:41.210
Enjoy the success,
and when we did that,

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:43.700
the music industry
changed dramatically.

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.520
And we came back, and
it was like, where

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.000
the hell is the music?

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.730
And we actually
went through a phase

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:56.960
where we actually went searching
for where the love was,

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.430
I guess we used to call it.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:22:03.810
And we would go and do shows
and then things like that,

00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:08.060
and it just wasn't
as great as it--

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:10.530
we would go overseas, and
of course, it would be huge.

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:13.490
It would be amazing,
but we live in America,

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:15.830
so we wanted love where we were.

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:22.170
And we actually took a bit of a
nosedive, you know what I mean?

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.020
And during that time,
it was very humbling.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.950
It was very humbling because we
didn't know exactly what to do.

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:29.660
We would actually
sit home and wait

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.210
for the big dates,
which would come,

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:34.310
but they were far
and few between.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:39.060
And we had to, like you
said, rebrand ourselves.

00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:42.290
We had to re-face ourselves,
and honestly, that's

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:46.670
around the time when we met our
manager now, Mr. Joe Mulvihill,

00:22:46.670 --> 00:22:49.040
and he put together
a bit of a team.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.920
And that team basically
sat down with us

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.370
and said, how hard are
you willing to work

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:57.824
to get to a certain place?

00:22:57.824 --> 00:22:59.240
This is going to
be very humbling.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.630
This is going to be humiliating,
to a certain extent,

00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:06.860
because you went out from making
$500,000 a night at Madison

00:23:06.860 --> 00:23:11.360
Square Garden on New Year's
to now performing in places

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.590
that you're not going
to feel too good about.

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:16.640
But it's going to be a whole lot
of shows, you know what I mean?

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.320
It was like dog and pony shows.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.780
And they put this
schedule together,

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:25.995
and it was a schedule for--
how long was that schedule?

00:23:25.995 --> 00:23:27.370
JOE MULVIHILL:
For the first one?

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:28.280
WANYA MORRIS: Yeah,
talk in the mic.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.040
JOE MULVIHILL: The first one?

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.854
WANYA MORRIS: Yeah.

00:23:29.854 --> 00:23:31.520
JOE MULVIHILL: Probably
six weeks maybe.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.260
The first-- the one
you wanted to kill me?

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:33.500
WANYA MORRIS: Yeah.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:34.160
JOE MULVIHILL:
Yeah, the first one.

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.450
That was six weeks.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:37.460
WANYA MORRIS: Yeah,
and we did these shows.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:39.950
And I'm telling you,
you go from performing

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:42.440
at theaters and
arenas to performing

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.732
at a place called Pufferbellies,
you know what I mean?

00:23:44.732 --> 00:23:46.690
JOE MULVIHILL: Does
anybody know Pufferbellies?

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.482
It's in Cape Cod.

00:23:48.482 --> 00:23:49.190
WANYA MORRIS: No.

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.610
NATHAN MORRIS: No.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:50.390
JOE MULVIHILL: Well, they're
all going to tell you

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:51.370
about The Firehouse--

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:52.620
NATHAN MORRIS: The Firehouse--

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:53.780
JOE MULVIHILL: --and how
much of an asshole I am.

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:54.190
NATHAN MORRIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:54.190 --> 00:23:54.800
JOE MULVIHILL: They're going
to tell you that in a second.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.890
WANYA MORRIS: These
places were, you

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.160
could say, maybe 500 capacity.

00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:01.880
And there was like
50 people there.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.840
And you know, we actually
looked at each other literally

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.020
and was like, holy shit.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:11.900
What is happening to us?

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.640
What are we doing?

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.650
And honestly, I say
it all the time.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:19.310
We, throughout this time,
this humbling period,

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:26.380
we broke up like five times, but
it was five minutes each time.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.724
You know, honestly, and I
guess Nate can continue on.

00:24:29.724 --> 00:24:30.890
NATHAN MORRIS: Well, no, no.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:32.680
I mean, he's 100% correct.

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:37.250
It took a lot for us to really
wrap our head around changing

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:38.420
gears, as you said.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.940
And what we were
able to do was--

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:43.610
a lot of people don't know
all the history of our group.

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:45.230
They know that we sing.

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:49.000
We've got some so-called
pretty good records.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.770
Well, I just-- I ain't going
to say they're all good.

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:54.090
But you know, we make records.

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:57.260
But a lot of people don't
know that a lot of our career

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.677
was spent grinding, learning
how to be performers.

00:24:59.677 --> 00:25:01.260
A lot of people don't
understand that.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.530
They've seen the videos
of "Motown Philly,"

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:05.180
and then they see
"End of the Road,"

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:07.055
and we kind of walk
around and don't do much.

00:25:07.055 --> 00:25:08.850
So-- being honest.

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.370
So hypothetically,
if you were ever

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:11.870
to hear about a
Boyz II Men concert,

00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:14.780
you have no idea what to expect,
because all you see us do

00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:16.795
is walk around in videos.

00:25:16.795 --> 00:25:20.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.310
So my point being is that--

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.301
exactly.

00:25:25.301 --> 00:25:26.300
WANYA MORRIS: That's it.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.622
That was it.

00:25:28.622 --> 00:25:30.830
NATHAN MORRIS: So my point
being that, because people

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:35.180
didn't know that about
us, we were able to use it

00:25:35.180 --> 00:25:36.410
to our advantage.

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.524
Like when you said, figure
out, the music industry

00:25:38.524 --> 00:25:39.940
changing, what are
we going to do?

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.648
Are we going to jump
ship or do whatever?

00:25:41.648 --> 00:25:43.910
So what we were able
to do is, I guess

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:47.180
you say, lean more
towards being a performing

00:25:47.180 --> 00:25:49.940
group versus a recording
group, because there was not

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:51.440
a lot of money in
it for us anymore.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.660
Because people were
stealing records.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.430
They weren't paying publishing
correctly, even to today.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.850
So we were able to transcend
and start that circuit

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:02.730
that Wan was talking about,
getting back on the road,

00:26:02.730 --> 00:26:06.630
performing, and becoming a
performing group to where it's

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.940
one of the only forms of
music that people still

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.500
can't take from you now.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.310
They can't copy it.

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.150
They can't steal it.

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:13.483
They can't do anything about it.

00:26:13.483 --> 00:26:16.500
They have to come to the concert
to see a live performance.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.266
We get some--

00:26:18.266 --> 00:26:20.232
I don't want to name any
networks or whatever.

00:26:20.232 --> 00:26:21.690
It's oh, well,
let's come to Vegas,

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:23.430
and we want to tape your show.

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:24.240
And we're like, no.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.430
We're not letting anybody tape
anything live that we have,

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:27.638
because it's all we got left.

00:26:27.638 --> 00:26:30.060
You know, when you make a
record and you put it out,

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.500
instantly the whole
world gets it.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.500
And after that it's pretty
much stolen, gone, or whatever.

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:35.784
So we don't control it.

00:26:35.784 --> 00:26:37.450
It's the only thing
that we can control.

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:39.960
So again, like I said, we
were able to switch gears

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.840
and realize that in
this day and age for us,

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:44.460
performing is the key.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.230
Because it's the
only thing that we

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.240
have sacred that we
can offer to our fan

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.715
base that you just can't
go on the internet and get.

00:26:50.715 --> 00:26:53.604
WANYA MORRIS: But to get to that
point, we went through a lot.

00:26:53.604 --> 00:26:54.520
We went through a lot.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:57.737
I mean, like I was
saying, we performed

00:26:57.737 --> 00:26:59.820
in this place called--
what, was it The Firehouse?

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:00.435
NATHAN MORRIS: The Firehouse.

00:27:00.435 --> 00:27:01.601
WANYA MORRIS: The Firehouse.

00:27:01.601 --> 00:27:05.550
And like I said, it
was like 500 capacity.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:08.582
And we walked into
this place, and--

00:27:08.582 --> 00:27:10.040
NATHAN MORRIS: It
was 500 capacity.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.000
That didn't mean that
that's how many was there.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.220
WANYA MORRIS: I'm telling you,
there wasn't 500 people there,

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.000
you know.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.370
We walked in the place, and
there's a mechanical bull

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:19.530
in the middle of the floor.

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:22.794
And I didn't know we was about
to recreate the pony video--

00:27:22.794 --> 00:27:24.210
you know what I'm
saying-- or not.

00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:28.980
But we walked in this place,
and there's a mechanical bull.

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:31.060
The stage got a
pole in front of it.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.220
And I'm like, is
this a strip club?

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.940
JOE MULVIHILL:
There's a Coors Light

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:36.990
over a billiard as your lights.

00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:39.000
WANYA MORRIS: Like, seriously.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.310
And we get there,
it's like, you know,

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.080
it was-- literally
50 people showed up.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.580
NATHAN MORRIS: And
Joe wasn't there.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:45.910
WANYA MORRIS: And
Joe-- no, he was at--

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:46.440
JOE MULVIHILL: No, I was there.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.190
NATHAN MORRIS: Oh no, you
was there for that one.

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.670
WANYA MORRIS: No he was there.

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:48.130
He was our manager.

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:48.600
NATHAN MORRIS: He was
there for that one.

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.310
I forgot.

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:49.800
JOE MULVIHILL: Hold on.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.840
I thought I was going to be
fired, because when they--

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.440
NATHAN MORRIS: Close.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.606
JOE MULVIHILL: Yeah, thanks.

00:27:53.606 --> 00:27:56.280
When they were singing
"End of the Road,"

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.019
there was a woman on the bull.

00:27:59.019 --> 00:28:00.060
WANYA MORRIS: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.393
JOE MULVIHILL: And they looked
at me like, really, dude?

00:28:02.393 --> 00:28:05.980
WANYA MORRIS: And it was
crazy, because, you know--

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.915
and this is why
I love my fellas.

00:28:07.915 --> 00:28:08.790
You know what I mean?

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:12.161
Because we share the same
veracity when it comes to what

00:28:12.161 --> 00:28:12.660
we do.

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:15.519
You know what I'm saying?

00:28:15.519 --> 00:28:17.060
It was 50 people
there, and you would

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:20.210
have thought that it
was 5,000, because we

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.820
sang each song the
way that we've always

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:24.285
learned how to sing everything.

00:28:24.285 --> 00:28:25.993
SHAWN STOCKMAN: The
only way we know how.

00:28:25.993 --> 00:28:29.600
WANYA MORRIS: The only way
we know how is to go 120%.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:33.710
And as time progressed
throughout those months

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:36.230
and months and
years of performing

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:39.530
at these crazy, crazy
places, you know,

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:41.475
the numbers started
building again.

00:28:41.475 --> 00:28:42.350
You know what I mean?

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:46.620
50 to 100 to maybe like
500, and then 5,000,

00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:48.500
and then we did the US Open.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:50.400
We sang the national
anthem at the US Open.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:50.990
JOE MULVIHILL: "God
Bless America."

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.920
WANYA MORRIS: "God
Bless America."

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:52.180
Yeah.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:52.971
No, we switched it.

00:28:52.971 --> 00:28:54.090
Didn't we flip it?

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:54.590
We did--

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:55.310
JOE MULVIHILL: Maybe did both.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.643
WANYA MORRIS: Yeah, we did both.

00:28:56.643 --> 00:28:57.830
We did both.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:29:00.680
And from that point, I guess,
you know, like Joe said,

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:05.351
the key is to get corporate
America to believe in the brand

00:29:05.351 --> 00:29:05.850
again.

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:10.460
And once we did that, it
started building and building.

00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.150
But it took a very long time.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.210
And honestly, I remember
being on a boat,

00:29:14.210 --> 00:29:17.750
a cruise, looking at each
other like, man, this is it.

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:19.040
After this, we out.

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.591
I remember in the
van, in the van,

00:29:21.591 --> 00:29:23.090
Shawn was like, if
this [GRUMBLES] I

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:23.890
don't want to do this no more.

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:25.760
I said, I don't want to
do this no more, either.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.630
You know what I'm saying?

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:27.130
We done.

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:28.400
Let's just quit it.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.440
And then we got to
the room, and you

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.020
know, Nate came to the
room, and he was like, look,

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:34.460
man, this is us.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:35.780
This is all we got.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.985
And Shawn, we all just, it was
like, yeah, you right, bro.

00:29:38.985 --> 00:29:39.860
You know what I mean?

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.970
This-- this is all
we got, for real.

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:42.876
You know?

00:29:42.876 --> 00:29:44.770
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Where
the hell am I going?

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:46.853
WANYA MORRIS: [? CMB. ?]
You know what I'm saying?

00:29:46.853 --> 00:29:48.080
We are our brother's keeper.

00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.121
You know what I'm saying?

00:29:49.121 --> 00:29:53.360
So it was one of those things
that, it brought us closer.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:54.575
You know?

00:29:54.575 --> 00:29:56.960
One member was gone, but
it brought us closer.

00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:01.590
It showed us that we were
the last of the Mohicans.

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:04.394
And we had to maintain
that integrity.

00:30:04.394 --> 00:30:05.810
JOE MULVIHILL: You
know, everybody

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:08.370
sees, like in
sports, LeBron James.

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:10.640
You see him when he
performs on the court.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.340
You don't see the other
22 hours, what he puts in

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.140
to get what you see on TV.

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:18.500
And what I learned when I met
them was the personalities

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.292
and the dynamics.

00:30:19.292 --> 00:30:21.500
Some of you probably are
surprised how funny they are

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.900
and how goofy they are,
and how they-- and when

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:28.170
I saw that, I was like, I said,
we need the world to see that.

00:30:28.170 --> 00:30:29.420
We all know "End of the Road."

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:30.260
We all know "Motown Philly."

00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:30.910
We all know that.

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:33.285
And those are going to be hits
for the rest of your life.

00:30:33.285 --> 00:30:35.210
But how do you get people
to get to know you?

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:36.760
Not just, oh yeah,
I know that guy.

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.190
They didn't know Wan's name.

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.110
They didn't know Shawn's name.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:41.360
I mean, they did, but nobody
knew their personalities

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:41.860
behind it.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:44.270
So the theory was, if
we just get them out.

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:46.400
Now, I wasn't
anticipating a bull.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:49.052
I wasn't anticipating
Pufferbellies,

00:30:49.052 --> 00:30:50.010
all those other things.

00:30:50.010 --> 00:30:50.390
NATHAN MORRIS: You booked it.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:51.080
What do you mean, you wasn't--

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:52.730
JOE MULVIHILL: Well,
I didn't really--

00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:53.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:55.490
I didn't realize.

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:56.960
I didn't realize
that those were--

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.793
you know what, dude?

00:30:57.793 --> 00:31:01.250
I didn't realize, OK?

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:03.980
So what we learned from
a business standpoint,

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.560
and because you guys are
innovators and thinkers,

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.050
the thought process
behind it was,

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:12.560
if we grind it out long
enough, eventually,

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.990
because I know what I like,
and I think other people

00:31:14.990 --> 00:31:16.490
like what I like,
for the most part.

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:17.790
You got good attitudes.

00:31:17.790 --> 00:31:19.010
You guys are good people.

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:20.664
You have unbelievable songs.

00:31:20.664 --> 00:31:22.580
Let's just see where
this can kind of take us.

00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.620
And slowly, but--
and Wan's right.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.340
It was a very slow process.

00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.127
I was questioning
myself 100 times.

00:31:28.127 --> 00:31:29.960
Like, why are you putting
them through this?

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:30.620
I was fans.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.530
That's why I even
decided to do it.

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:34.700
I was a fan way bef--

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.410
Janet Jackson, the Super Bowl.

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:38.270
I was working for the
Super Bowl at the time

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:40.160
Janet Jackson's thing came out.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.934
And right after that, I got
a phone call to go to Japan

00:31:43.934 --> 00:31:45.350
and meet Boyz II
Men, because they

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:48.674
were about to fire your
existing manager, I believe.

00:31:48.674 --> 00:31:51.090
And when I went out there, I
saw one show, and I was like,

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:52.940
OK, there's a real
business here.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:54.140
I mean a real business.

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.780
And I sat down and said, guys,
there's something real here.

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:57.859
This is what I think.

00:31:57.859 --> 00:32:00.150
NATHAN MORRIS: Well, he road
managed us for a long time

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:00.550
at first.

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:02.174
That's when he booked
the Pufferbellies

00:32:02.174 --> 00:32:04.790
and the mechanical bull.

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:07.970
And then we, like he said,
we were in the process

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:09.800
of looking for another manager.

00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.690
And because we've
gone through so much--

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:13.440
we've gone through a
lot in this business.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.410
And again, one thing
about this group,

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:18.260
when it comes to people
that we meet and we grow

00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:20.510
a liking to, we become
very, very attached,

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:25.220
and very, very loyal, almost
to a fault. And it's kind of

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:28.700
put us in spots where
our loyalty outweighed

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.290
what someone else
was doing to us,

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:32.390
and kind of put us
in bad situations.

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:37.450
So with Joe coming
along, we were already

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:40.580
kind of bruised kids from a lot
of different things happening.

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.680
So we really had to play
it back a little bit

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:46.740
and kind of see what we
felt he could give us.

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:49.010
And we played it for a while.

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:50.580
We made him run around a lot.

00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:52.010
You know what I'm saying?

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:56.160
We did stupid stuff to just see
if he'd do it, and he did it.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:56.910
I mean, you know--

00:32:56.910 --> 00:32:58.340
JOE MULVIHILL: You made
me change my shoes.

00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.215
NATHAN MORRIS: Yeah, he
used to come around--

00:33:00.215 --> 00:33:02.150
you know us-- with
these beat up Puma

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:04.902
white shoes that looked
like he was kicking rocks.

00:33:04.902 --> 00:33:06.110
And we had to tell him that--

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:07.340
WANYA MORRIS: Like, dude, you
hanging with black people.

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.060
You can't have
those crusty shoes.

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.809
NATHAN MORRIS: Can't
have no crusty shoes.

00:33:10.809 --> 00:33:13.430
So now his shoe game
is all switched up now.

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:16.050
So he's got that fresh part.

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:17.540
He still likes to
wear swag a lot.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:18.581
You know what I'm saying?

00:33:18.581 --> 00:33:20.510
We got to still get
him out of free stuff.

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:23.235
You know, somebody give him
free stuff on the golf course,

00:33:23.235 --> 00:33:24.860
he'll come to a
meeting with that shit.

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.420
And we had to tell him,
you can't wear that.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:28.670
So we still working on him.

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:33.750
But the funny thing is, there
was a situation where-- this

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:36.065
was right before we hired him.

00:33:36.065 --> 00:33:39.430
I used to play "John
Madden NFL Football" a lot.

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:41.065
And at the day,
it just came out,

00:33:41.065 --> 00:33:42.190
and I just bought the game.

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:44.060
We were on the road
doing some shows.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.957
And we were going to
this hotel that night,

00:33:45.957 --> 00:33:47.540
and while we were
doing press all day,

00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:49.820
I was all excited to get to
my room and play the game.

00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:51.410
I was talking about it all day.

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:54.440
And I got to the room, and
they had one of those old TVs

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.810
that you couldn't really
plug the new HDMI into.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:59.480
So I was pissed
for like an hour.

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.492
And then Joe called me.

00:34:00.492 --> 00:34:02.200
He gave me the schedule
for the next day.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.140
So he said, you got everything?

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.470
I said, yeah, dude,
but I'm pissed off.

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:05.960
I was trying to play my
game, da-da-da da-da.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.040
He said, whoa, whoa,
whoa-- what's wrong?

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.239
I said, the TV's jacked up.

00:34:08.239 --> 00:34:10.280
I called downstairs to
see if they had a monitor.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.210
I know they got one.

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:12.380
They're holding it from me.

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:13.471
They won't give it to me.

00:34:13.471 --> 00:34:15.179
So he's like, oh, hold
on for one second.

00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:16.179
Give me like 20 minutes.

00:34:16.179 --> 00:34:18.659
So I get a knock on the door.

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:21.590
Somebody brings a brand new
TV, flat screen TV, in my room.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:23.860
And I'm like, I called him,
I'm like, dude, somebody--

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:24.260
what am I doing with this?

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:27.080
He said, dude, just open the
TV, play the game tonight,

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.330
just don't throw away the box.

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:30.739
So I'm like, all right.

00:34:30.739 --> 00:34:32.630
So I still--

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:36.884
JOE MULVIHILL: They're all
thinking, damn, that's smart.

00:34:36.884 --> 00:34:38.300
NATHAN MORRIS: And
what's funny is

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:42.860
that these are the things
that always click in my mind,

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:47.820
because this is someone
who thinks outside the box.

00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:48.940
And as a manager--

00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:49.620
SHAWN STOCKMAN:
Figuratively speaking.

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:50.960
WANYA MORRIS: Literally.

00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:51.793
NATHAN MORRIS: Yeah.

00:34:51.793 --> 00:34:55.100
And literally, that's what
managers need in this business,

00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:58.790
to be able to kind of go around
and maneuver without making

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:00.500
the artist look bad.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:04.441
So I played the game all night,
and then I put the TV back

00:35:04.441 --> 00:35:04.940
in the box.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.106
We go downstairs, and we're
flying to the next city.

00:35:07.106 --> 00:35:08.330
Because I'm flying to Miami.

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:10.974
And I'm like, OK, well, I
said, what do I do with the TV?

00:35:10.974 --> 00:35:13.390
Just bring it downstairs, we're
going to put it in the van

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:14.150
and take it to the airport.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:16.120
I said, take it to the
airport and do what?

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.080
So, make a long
story short, not only

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.110
did he take the TV
back to the store,

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:23.930
he bought it in the city
we were in, flew to Miami,

00:35:23.930 --> 00:35:27.390
and took it back to
Walmart in the other city.

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:31.130
So, right away for me, I
was like, that's the kind

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:32.720
of thinker that we
need on our team.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.220
That--

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.360
WANYA MORRIS: Hustler--
you're hustling.

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:35.810
NATHAN MORRIS: --can help
us do what we need to do.

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:38.268
WANYA MORRIS: Ain't nothing to
see, a hustler is a hustler.

00:35:38.268 --> 00:35:40.400
But when you got a
white boy hustler--

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:40.900
man.

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:41.730
You know?

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:43.130
It's funny.

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:47.750
And not to make this a
Joe Mulvihill situation,

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:51.450
but, you know, I remember
we were on the plane--

00:35:51.450 --> 00:35:52.590
no, we were on a train.

00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:53.975
We were on a train in Japan.

00:35:53.975 --> 00:35:55.560
And I didn't know him.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:58.320
I didn't give him as much
time as everybody else did.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.789
You know, I didn't
trust people too much.

00:36:00.789 --> 00:36:01.830
You know what I'm saying?

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:02.630
I like people.

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:05.280
I love them, but I didn't
trust people too much.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.270
And I was sitting there next to
him, and he was looking at me.

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:10.920
This was probably
only the second time

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:11.795
we might have talked.

00:36:11.795 --> 00:36:14.714
And he looked at me, and
I'm sitting there, you know,

00:36:14.714 --> 00:36:16.860
eating my peanuts and stuff.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:21.466
And he said, you
don't like me, do you?

00:36:21.466 --> 00:36:22.840
And I was like,
I don't know you.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.880
You know what I mean?

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:25.000
And he was like--

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.510
I mean, I said, I know you-- you
know, I know what you're about.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:29.680
What am I about?

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:33.762
I said, you're an
opportunist, right?

00:36:33.762 --> 00:36:34.470
And he was like--

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:35.040
JOE MULVIHILL: I lost my mind.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:35.950
WANYA MORRIS: He lost his mind.

00:36:35.950 --> 00:36:37.260
And I was looking
at him like, what's

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.551
the matter with this white boy?

00:36:38.551 --> 00:36:39.870
You know what I'm saying?

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:42.270
I said, dude, I
said, listen, I said,

00:36:42.270 --> 00:36:44.580
don't-- you're taking
it the wrong way, bro.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.380
I said, you're an
opportunist, which

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:48.940
means that you look
for opportunities.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:51.180
And these opportunities
benefit you.

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:55.350
I said, and as these
opportunities benefit you,

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:58.620
because you're working
with us, that opportunity

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.320
is going to benefit us.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.910
I said, so I'm glad you're an
opportunist, because we haven't

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:06.000
had anybody around who was
looking for opportunities

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:06.700
for us.

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.850
I said, you see
something in us, and you

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:10.170
see there's an opportunity.

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:13.251
I said, so use us, [MUTED].

00:37:13.251 --> 00:37:13.750
Exact words.

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:14.650
JOE MULVIHILL: Exact words.

00:37:14.650 --> 00:37:15.500
WANYA MORRIS: Exact words.

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.290
SPEAKER: That was a quote.

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:17.320
WANYA MORRIS: Exact words.

00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:18.120
SPEAKER: That was a quote.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.120
WANYA MORRIS: End
quote, end quote.

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:19.910
SPEAKER: End quote.

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:20.220
WANYA MORRIS: End quote.

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:20.750
You know what I'm saying?

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:21.516
NATHAN MORRIS: Close, close.

00:37:21.516 --> 00:37:22.160
WANYA MORRIS: No offense.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:22.516
That's what we say--

00:37:22.516 --> 00:37:22.872
SPEAKER: I got you.

00:37:22.872 --> 00:37:23.230
I got you.

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.920
WANYA MORRIS: --when
that's our homeboy now.

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:24.112
NATHAN MORRIS: Close it.

00:37:24.112 --> 00:37:24.240
Close it.

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.210
WANYA MORRIS: You're
our homeboy now.

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:25.980
NATHAN MORRIS: Close
that quote down.

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.060
Go.

00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:27.560
Yeah.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:27.810
SPEAKER: All right.

00:37:27.810 --> 00:37:29.745
So we are going to turn
it over for questions.

00:37:29.745 --> 00:37:31.828
WANYA MORRIS: Yeah, we
talk about it all the time.

00:37:31.828 --> 00:37:33.990
SPEAKER: Now that we
just said the end quote.

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:36.198
If you do have a question,
please line up at the mic,

00:37:36.198 --> 00:37:39.840
and I will ask my last
question as you guys think

00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.225
about what you want to ask.

00:37:41.225 --> 00:37:43.970
So let's get started.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:45.800
I'll close out this
portion of the panel

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:48.200
by saying that Oprah
had a video that

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.780
went viral a couple of days ago
that said young people right

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:54.250
now are focused too much on
building their brand instead

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:58.130
of the quality of their
work, the craft, right?

00:37:58.130 --> 00:37:59.570
So for those of
us in the audience

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:02.070
who have a side hustle, or who
may be interested in starting

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:04.760
a business, or whatever it is
that you are innovating right

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.640
now, what advice, and
what order would you

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.700
give with that notion?

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:12.860
NATHAN MORRIS: You go,
because [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.370
SHAWN STOCKMAN: I'll say this.

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:16.300
I'll say a quick story.

00:38:16.300 --> 00:38:19.560
I got a 15-year-old at home.

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:25.870
And he put me on game as
far as how kids nowadays,

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:28.470
with the opposite sex, or
somebody that they like,

00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:29.970
communicate with each other.

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:33.570
And they do almost everything
through text, right?

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:36.150
That's how they ask for
a person's phone number.

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:37.960
I don't know how
they get the number.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.780
I don't know.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.330
And that's how they ask for
dates, movies, the whole

00:38:42.330 --> 00:38:43.720
nine yards.

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:49.570
And I asked my son, I was like,
so, when do you talk to them?

00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:50.070
You know?

00:38:50.070 --> 00:38:51.510
And he was like, well,
we don't really--

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:53.343
you know, we go to the
movies and that's it.

00:38:53.343 --> 00:38:54.720
I was like, that's it?

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.240
You know you're skipping
a few steps, right?

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.040
So it kind of correlates
to what you're

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.710
saying as far as like,
it's cool to create

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:06.357
this facade of who you
might be or what you are,

00:39:06.357 --> 00:39:07.440
and things of that nature.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.810
But there's still
an organics to it

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:12.000
that you still have to apply.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.310
You still have to
talk to the girl.

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:16.680
You have to ask
her what she likes.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:20.220
You have to be in
her face, and have

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:23.570
what's called a conversation,
and things of that nature.

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:24.090
WANYA MORRIS: See if
her breath stinks.

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:25.006
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Right.

00:39:25.006 --> 00:39:25.944
Whatever.

00:39:25.944 --> 00:39:27.360
You know, you have
to find out all

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:30.870
of those things in order for
you to really like or dislike

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:31.950
this person.

00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:35.670
I think that with social
media, it's a great tool,

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:39.150
but again, I think a lot
of kids are skipping steps.

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:42.390
They are taking
it for face value.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:45.970
If I look like this, if I sound
like this, if I act like this,

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:47.370
then I'm going to be successful.

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:52.320
And they never really take the
time to put in the organic work

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.760
to actually be the
person that you

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.600
are perceiving yourself to be.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.600
And that takes the work.

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:00.930
Like Joe mentioned
about LeBron James.

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:03.570
He just doesn't get up and
play the way that he does.

00:40:03.570 --> 00:40:06.570
He practices hard every day.

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:10.290
With my group, we just don't
go out there and sing songs.

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:11.190
We practice.

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.910
We rehearse.

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:14.920
We've done this time
and time and time again.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.220
And that quality
comes with that.

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:18.630
You have to put in those--

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:19.950
I guess, what's that theory?

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:23.680
If you put 10,000 hours into
something, then you-- yeah,

00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.870
yeah.

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:27.630
That guarantees that you
don't become something that

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:30.730
fizzles out very soon after.

00:40:30.730 --> 00:40:32.617
So you have to put
in that organic time.

00:40:32.617 --> 00:40:34.950
NATHAN MORRIS: And I think
as far as the brand building,

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:39.810
I believe that the key
to it all is service.

00:40:39.810 --> 00:40:41.520
A lot of people,
like you said, they

00:40:41.520 --> 00:40:45.270
tend to focus today
on building the brand.

00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:48.090
But now I know a brand,
but I know a brand

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:50.740
for giving me shitty service.

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:52.770
One thing that we've
known throughout history,

00:40:52.770 --> 00:40:54.570
we know what type
of shoes Nike makes.

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:57.390
We know what Google offers.

00:40:57.390 --> 00:41:00.450
Those brands have
cemented, I guess

00:41:00.450 --> 00:41:02.490
you'd say, a form of
quality, that you know,

00:41:02.490 --> 00:41:04.946
when you add it to that
name, you're not really

00:41:04.946 --> 00:41:06.570
contemplating what
you're going to get,

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:07.611
because you already know.

00:41:07.611 --> 00:41:09.090
So to your point,
yeah, there are

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:10.470
a lot of people
out there now who

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:13.240
are so-called on their hustle,
and want to build their brand.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:16.330
But if your brand doesn't
represent any type of quality

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:18.840
service, then all you
really have is a brand--

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:20.250
a brand with a bad reputation.

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:21.340
SHAWN STOCKMAN: And
you get exposed.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:22.005
So don't skip--

00:41:22.005 --> 00:41:22.430
WANYA MORRIS: Eventually.

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:23.304
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Yeah.

00:41:23.304 --> 00:41:24.870
So don't skip the steps.

00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:26.912
That would be the main
point of this whole thing.

00:41:26.912 --> 00:41:28.744
JOE MULVIHILL: And real
quick, to the point,

00:41:28.744 --> 00:41:30.180
grinding it out
with Pufferbellies

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:32.550
and the mechanical
bull and all that

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:34.680
was their second
stage of their career,

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.680
doing all the groundwork
to not only work out jokes,

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.880
how they communicate.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:40.510
You know, we did an
event in Atlanta,

00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:41.520
the 100 Black Men event.

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.050
I was the only white guy there.

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:45.760
We literally got on the plane,
flew to Orlando, Florida,

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.010
for Arnold Palmer, the golfer.

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:48.480
Everybody knows the
golfer Arnold Palmer.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.750
And they were the
only black guys there.

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:51.540
And we looked at
each other and said,

00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.360
how crazy is this that
you guys can resonate

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.006
amongst anyone all over?

00:41:56.006 --> 00:41:57.630
Color-- it doesn't
matter who they are.

00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:58.230
WANYA MORRIS: Doesn't matter.

00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:59.855
JOE MULVIHILL: And
how did that happen?

00:41:59.855 --> 00:42:02.135
I really think the
grind, the humbleness--

00:42:02.135 --> 00:42:03.510
because you got
to remember, they

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:05.490
were kids making
millions of dollars.

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:06.365
Everybody loved them.

00:42:06.365 --> 00:42:08.781
They were the greatest thing
in the world to nobody cared.

00:42:08.781 --> 00:42:10.560
They lived through
the Nirvana era.

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.150
They lived through
the hip-hop era.

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:13.770
They lived through
the boy band era.

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:15.270
They live, now, the
[INAUDIBLE] era.

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:16.720
I mean, every single thing--

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:17.260
I don't even know what it is.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:18.551
[INAUDIBLE], or whatever it is.

00:42:18.551 --> 00:42:21.210
But the point is, the music
has changed over the last 20

00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:22.410
dramatically.

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:24.210
'80s music had two
forms of music.

00:42:24.210 --> 00:42:27.600
It was rock bands and
it was the '80s fun,

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.725
kind of goofy, poppy stuff.

00:42:28.725 --> 00:42:30.391
NATHAN MORRIS: That's
if you were white.

00:42:30.391 --> 00:42:31.690
But they had other stuff, too.

00:42:31.690 --> 00:42:33.737
JOE MULVIHILL: And
R&amp;B. The point is--

00:42:33.737 --> 00:42:35.070
NATHAN MORRIS: Oh, and just R&amp;B?

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:36.220
We didn't have hip-hop, huh?

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:37.890
JOE MULVIHILL: Well, yeah,
it just started in the '80s.

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:38.790
NATHAN MORRIS: I just thought
I'd throw it out there.

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:40.120
JOE MULVIHILL: It just
started in the '80s.

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.060
NATHAN MORRIS: You
notice he only named

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:42.480
his two forms of music, right?

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:43.830
JOE MULVIHILL: You know what?

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:48.780
My point is, we
as a business were

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:50.760
able to not only adjust to--

00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:52.210
we weren't chasing anything.

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:54.480
We were just being
real to who they were.

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:55.440
That's the problem
with the internet.

00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:57.650
You see something, and you try
to change it up to follow that,

00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:58.500
and you're too late.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.039
If you just do what you
do, eventually, patience--

00:43:01.039 --> 00:43:03.330
and anybody in the room, no
matter what you want to do,

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:05.700
if you have kids, don't
have kids, have a business,

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.260
side hustle, no matter what is--

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:09.821
patience and showing
up are the two things

00:43:09.821 --> 00:43:10.820
that can take you there.

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:12.290
SHAWN STOCKMAN:
And one more thing.

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:13.590
Learning how to communicate.

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:16.310
A lot of people tend to put--

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:18.600
and I guess it's kind
of customary for us

00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.180
to be put into a category.

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.610
We're an R&amp;B group,
mainly because people

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:25.060
see black people.

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:28.810
But as you look in the
room, who do you see?

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:30.280
You just don't see black people.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.770
You see all types and
nationalities and colors

00:43:32.770 --> 00:43:35.260
and age groups and
things of that nature.

00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:37.210
I think mainly
because of the fact

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:39.550
that we learned
how to communicate.

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:41.200
It wasn't just about the music.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.860
We knew how to communicate
our message through the music.

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.230
And the music was kind
of like the byproduct,

00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:49.550
in the sense of, yes, I
really like those songs.

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:51.520
But just like Nate
mentioned, a lot of people

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.950
just saw in our videos just
us standing there pointing

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:55.575
at a camera, and
things of that nature,

00:43:55.575 --> 00:43:58.772
until they saw us in a
show and was like, wow,

00:43:58.772 --> 00:43:59.980
this was something different.

00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:02.310
This was something more,
more than I expected.

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:06.160
So with all of those trials
and tribulations, and us

00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.770
not skipping those
steps, we learned how

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:11.380
to communicate with everybody--

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:15.370
not just black people, not just
white people, but everybody.

00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:18.910
And I think that's
what kept us going.

00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:21.910
SPEAKER: All right.

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:24.830
So we are going to turn
it over to our questions,

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:26.630
starting with my sis, Michelle.

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:28.720
If you guys will first
introduce yourselves--

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:29.060
SHAWN STOCKMAN:
(SINGING) Michelle--

00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.265
SPEAKER: And then
keep your questions--

00:44:30.265 --> 00:44:31.510
SHAWN STOCKMAN: My belle--

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:32.720
SPEAKER: --as brief
as possible so

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.880
everyone can get a question in.

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:34.640
NATHAN MORRIS: And when
you finish, can you

00:44:34.640 --> 00:44:36.723
raise the microphone stand
up a little bit higher,

00:44:36.723 --> 00:44:38.921
because the people behind--
no, I'm just joking.

00:44:38.921 --> 00:44:43.000
SPEAKER: It's
arranged by height.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.625
NATHAN MORRIS: I'm just joking.

00:44:44.625 --> 00:44:46.360
AUDIENCE: I'll be like, dang!

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.284
SHAWN STOCKMAN: That
was a low-key burn.

00:44:48.284 --> 00:44:50.650
NATHAN MORRIS: I'm
just joking with you.

00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:52.889
AUDIENCE: Hi, so again,
my name is Michelle.

00:44:52.889 --> 00:44:53.930
Thank you all for coming.

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:55.085
Huge fan, super excited.

00:44:55.085 --> 00:44:55.490
JOE MULVIHILL: Where you from?

00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:56.540
AUDIENCE: Virginia.

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:57.290
NATHAN MORRIS: PA.

00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:58.550
AUDIENCE: PA.

00:44:58.550 --> 00:45:01.580
And my question
is, could you all

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:06.210
tell us your story as to how you
all got your name, Boyz II Men?

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:09.020
NATHAN MORRIS: Go ahead,
Shawn, you got it.

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:12.270
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Nathan and
I were on the phone one day.

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:15.750
We had a previous name
that we will not mention.

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:17.210
NATHAN MORRIS: Sure won't.

00:45:17.210 --> 00:45:17.976
Google it.

00:45:17.976 --> 00:45:19.100
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:19.100 --> 00:45:21.150
It's probably on Google.

00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:23.970
And while we were
talking on the phone,

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.820
there was a New Edition
song called "Boys to Men"

00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:28.960
that came on the radio
while we were talking.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.480
And I said, that's our name.

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.230
Like, that should be
our name right there.

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:33.795
WANYA MORRIS: And Nate
was like, I don't know.

00:45:33.795 --> 00:45:35.140
SHAWN STOCKMAN: And he's
like, well, I don't like it.

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:35.550
I don't like it.

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:36.180
NATHAN MORRIS: Well,
the only reason

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:39.242
why I said that, because at that
time we weren't Boyz II Men,

00:45:39.242 --> 00:45:40.950
and we weren't successful
doing anything.

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:43.487
So we just did local stuff.

00:45:43.487 --> 00:45:45.570
And every time we'd perform,
we did "Boys to Men,"

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:46.460
a New Edition song.

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:48.168
So, it would sound,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:45:48.168 --> 00:45:51.962
Boyz II Men singing, "Can You
Stand the Rain" by New Edition.

00:45:51.962 --> 00:45:53.670
It just sounded weird,
because that's all

00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:54.950
we did was New Edition covers.

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:56.780
And now our name
is a cover, too.

00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:00.297
So as we moved into our career--

00:46:00.297 --> 00:46:02.130
because it's funny,
when we talked about it,

00:46:02.130 --> 00:46:03.029
we said, all right.

00:46:03.029 --> 00:46:04.570
We'll hang on to it
for a little bit.

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:06.195
But over the years,
we realized that it

00:46:06.195 --> 00:46:10.599
became a name that was perfect
for us, because as Wan always

00:46:10.599 --> 00:46:12.390
says, you know, no
matter how hold you get,

00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:14.806
there's always going to be a
little bit of boy inside you.

00:46:14.806 --> 00:46:17.460
And for us, our music we
feel transcends generations

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:21.430
from old to young, boy
to man, woman to girl.

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:23.310
So it's one of those
things where it just

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:24.990
kind of stuck after a while.

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:25.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:27.193
NATHAN MORRIS: Thank you, Shawn.

00:46:27.193 --> 00:46:28.430
WANYA MORRIS: Thank you.

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:30.350
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:32.152
Same here, huge fan,
thank you for coming.

00:46:32.152 --> 00:46:33.110
BOYZ II MEN: Thank you.

00:46:33.110 --> 00:46:35.130
AUDIENCE: I'm from
the Bronx, New York.

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:37.130
WANYA MORRIS: Boogie down.

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:39.470
AUDIENCE: I kind of
wanted to hear from you,

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:42.690
you're talking a lot about
longevity and communication

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:43.760
and brand.

00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:46.700
And as a boys
group, Boyz II Men,

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:49.670
you know, there's so many
groups that we've heard of that

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:52.890
have just, not
even here anymore.

00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:53.540
They're gone.

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:55.730
And so I want to hear
you talk more about, what

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:59.240
are the values that you
all share that keep you

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:03.350
and this bond so tight despite
those five minute break

00:47:03.350 --> 00:47:06.150
ups and all of that stuff.

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:08.840
What has worked for you
to keep the partnership

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:11.640
strong and alive and empowering?

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:16.970
SHAWN STOCKMAN: We had a better
understanding than most of,

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:20.810
we're better together
than we are apart.

00:47:20.810 --> 00:47:23.240
Just like Wanya mentioned,
when we broke up,

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:25.470
we kind of got a
sense of clarity.

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:28.520
It was like, you know,
breaking up is not a good idea.

00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:33.470
And mainly because, also,
our fans and the people who

00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:37.620
supported us kept us up here.

00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:40.820
So even when we
didn't feel that way,

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:42.030
other people felt that way.

00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:45.980
So again, Nate mentioned
something about service.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:49.130
We felt like it was our duty.

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:54.950
We were servants to people
who appreciated what we did.

00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:56.930
Despite how we felt
about each other

00:47:56.930 --> 00:47:59.450
and ourselves, our
own selves, there

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:03.680
were people that wanted
to see us, that came out

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:07.880
time and time again, that
wanted to sing those songs

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:12.570
and live those memories again,
and things of that nature.

00:48:12.570 --> 00:48:17.020
So Boyz II Men has
become bigger than us.

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:20.060
The music and what
it's become is

00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:21.980
so much bigger than who we are.

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:23.540
Again, we just
consider ourselves

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:25.740
servants at the end of the day.

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:29.050
These songs have done so
much for so many people

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:30.740
that it's kind of
like, OK, well,

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:32.690
let's just do it for
them if not for us.

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:37.370
WANYA MORRIS: And I know that we
spoke about the stars aligning

00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:38.790
for our success.

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:42.110
But you know, we
believe that there's

00:48:42.110 --> 00:48:43.840
only one way that
stars can align,

00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:45.080
and that's by the Creator.

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.190
You know what I mean?

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:51.170
We actually, you know the day
that we decided to go into

00:48:51.170 --> 00:48:54.970
and sneak backstage at the-- you
know, the "Motown Philly" song,

00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:57.560
we snuck backstage and
met Michael Bivins.

00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:59.360
You know, we had no money.

00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:01.650
We had no idea how we
were going to get in.

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:06.140
And each and every time we
wanted something that night,

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:09.890
we would stand off
to the side and pray.

00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:11.570
And it was amazing.

00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:15.380
And I know that these fellas
can attest to it, that we

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.700
didn't have tickets to get in.

00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:20.480
We prayed, somebody
got us inside.

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.700
We couldn't get backstage.

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:27.260
We prayed, and somebody came
and helped us to get backstage.

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:31.710
And for us to be
together right now,

00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:33.920
it's just a
testament to the fact

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:36.580
that we're supposed to
be together right now.

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:38.880
And it's not for us, you know?

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:43.400
It's for those people who we
have a responsibility for,

00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:46.730
the child that actually,
mother came and said,

00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:50.060
you know, we played your
records for them while they were

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:52.370
in a coma, and they
came out of the coma,

00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:54.721
and they wanted to
hear Boyz II Men.

00:49:54.721 --> 00:49:55.220
You know?

00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:58.250
The little kid that's
in the front row that's

00:49:58.250 --> 00:50:00.770
nine years old, singing
"I'll Make Love to You."

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:03.100
Like, why?

00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:05.570
How-- why are you
singing that song?

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:07.520
You know what I'm saying?

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:11.150
But it's because we've
created some sort

00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:16.400
of non-offensive approach
to life and to love,

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.390
you know what I mean?

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:20.090
You know, everybody wants
their children and their family

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:24.350
to be able to be a part of
something that's not offensive.

00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:27.110
And God gave us these songs.

00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:27.970
We're just vehicles.

00:50:27.970 --> 00:50:29.180
You know what I mean?

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:30.740
Anybody could have
sang these songs,

00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:32.510
and they would have
been great songs.

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:35.330
But the way that
we feel these songs

00:50:35.330 --> 00:50:38.900
is because we know that
they were gifts to us.

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:41.520
And we have to share that
gift with everybody else.

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:44.450
So yeah, the stars aligned,
but God made them align,

00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:46.252
and that's why we're here.

00:50:46.252 --> 00:50:47.960
NATHAN MORRIS: And I
think the human side

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:50.420
of the longevity,
which is missing

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:54.370
in a lot of things today, which
is I believe, again, there's

00:50:54.370 --> 00:50:55.403
always--

00:50:55.403 --> 00:50:58.040
the key is the spiritual
aspect of who we are

00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:59.990
and what has
brought us together.

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:01.970
But being able to
stay together is, one,

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:03.470
to be able to,
like you said, all

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:04.550
the other groups aren't around.

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:06.675
And most of the main reasons
why they aren't around

00:51:06.675 --> 00:51:10.910
is because they don't respect
the people who they work with.

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:13.010
They don't understand
them for who

00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:16.150
they are, and are able to
live with their imperfections

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:18.330
and their rights
and their wrongs.

00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:20.090
We've learned over the
years to understand

00:51:20.090 --> 00:51:22.430
each personality of
each guy in this group,

00:51:22.430 --> 00:51:24.720
and that's who they are.

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.920
But we also have the ability,
that when one guy steps out

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:32.040
of line, the other two guys are
able to put him back in line.

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.220
None of us have become
so big to the point

00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:37.010
where none of the other
guys can tell you anything

00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:38.150
that you need to do.

00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:39.770
And that's what happens
with a lot of these groups.

00:51:39.770 --> 00:51:42.130
You know, they have those side
guys that come along and say,

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:43.265
yeah, you're bigger
than this guy.

00:51:43.265 --> 00:51:44.639
Yeah, you don't
need to be there.

00:51:44.639 --> 00:51:46.375
And the egos start
getting big to where

00:51:46.375 --> 00:51:48.500
the guys they created the
group with, they're like,

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.060
I don't really need these dudes.

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:51.470
I can do whatever I want.

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:55.285
But there's a humbling
within us that coordinates,

00:51:55.285 --> 00:51:56.660
similar to what
Wan is saying, is

00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:59.510
that, not only do we
do it for the audience,

00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:00.830
but we do it for each other.

00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:02.990
Neither one of us want
to let anyone else down

00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:04.880
with what we are here to do.

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.100
So when some guy is not
doing something right,

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:10.077
and we kind of put
him in check, we

00:52:10.077 --> 00:52:11.660
have to sit back and
think about that,

00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:14.270
because we just don't want
to screw this thing up.

00:52:14.270 --> 00:52:16.340
We know how important
we are to each other.

00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.200
JOE MULVIHILL: And they still
have fun, too, by the way.

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.783
And we constantly
do things that are--

00:52:19.783 --> 00:52:21.430
Wan wanted to record
with Tech N9ne.

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:22.730
We got him in with Tech N9ne.

00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:24.440
He's a junkie for rock music.

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:26.240
He recorded with
the Foo Fighters.

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.280
Nate loves Justin Bieber, so
we recorded with Justin Bieber.

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.410
So, no.

00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:31.690
No, the point is, we're
always doing something.

00:52:31.690 --> 00:52:31.790
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Huge Bieber.

00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:32.840
JOE MULVIHILL: The
Geico commercial.

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:33.500
NATHAN MORRIS: I'm
not even going to--

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:34.490
JOE MULVIHILL: I'm just kidding.

00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:35.200
I'm just kidding.

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:35.700
We did the--

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:35.960
NATHAN MORRIS: They know.

00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:36.370
JOE MULVIHILL:
--Geico commercial.

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:37.411
NATHAN MORRIS: They know.

00:52:37.411 --> 00:52:41.030
JOE MULVIHILL: So anyway, the
thing is, we still have fun.

00:52:41.030 --> 00:52:41.790
Twinkle, we good?

00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:42.561
Twinkle, we good?

00:52:42.561 --> 00:52:43.310
AUDIENCE: We good.

00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:44.060
JOE MULVIHILL: OK.

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:44.569
SPEAKER: OK.

00:52:44.569 --> 00:52:47.110
Don't shoot the messenger, but
we can take one more question.

00:52:47.110 --> 00:52:48.160
NATHAN MORRIS: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:48.510
AUDIENCE: No pressure.

00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:49.900
SPEAKER: I apologize in advance.

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.650
NATHAN MORRIS: Well, if you
stand next to her at the mic,

00:52:51.650 --> 00:52:52.816
it will be one big question.

00:52:52.816 --> 00:52:54.234
SPEAKER: OK, all right then.

00:52:54.234 --> 00:52:55.025
What they say goes.

00:52:55.025 --> 00:52:55.780
Let's do it.

00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:57.140
AUDIENCE: So, hi, I'm Jess.

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:59.880
I was born here in
San Jose, so local.

00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.540
You were my first introduction
to cool a capella music.

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:03.990
So thank you for that.

00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:06.270
And to go with that, I'm
part of Googapella, which

00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:07.500
is Google's a capella group.

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:10.410
And we've been working on
harmonies and blending,

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:12.960
and you guys are
the icons for that.

00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:16.529
Your music just transcends
the beauty that is blending.

00:53:16.529 --> 00:53:17.820
AUDIENCE: Sing something, Jess.

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:19.620
AUDIENCE: No.

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:21.150
You can come to a concert.

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:24.840
So what tricks or tips do you
have that works for blending

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:26.890
exercises, aside
from being so close

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:28.380
and having gone through so much.

00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:31.270
Is there something that
works for you as a group,

00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:33.330
whether it's like
breathing, or--

00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:34.210
NATHAN MORRIS: Hold
on, we'll lock that in.

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:35.910
We'll get both questions in,
and then we'll answer them.

00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:36.929
Go.

00:53:36.929 --> 00:53:37.470
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:39.370
So the question--
I'm from Moscow.

00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:40.020
I'm Natalia.

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:43.680
So the question is about--

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.810
actually, I'll turn
my question to that.

00:53:45.810 --> 00:53:49.890
"At the end of the
road," those lyrics,

00:53:49.890 --> 00:53:52.340
can you talk a little
bit more, like,

00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:54.895
although we've come to
the end of the road, which

00:53:54.895 --> 00:53:57.240
is the end of the
road right now, right?

00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:02.400
Can we-- is it OK to ask to
come to the end of the road

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:03.920
and ask you to sing?

00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.420
NATHAN MORRIS:
Oh, see, now you--

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:10.080
we should have just
let you sit down.

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:12.910
See what happens when you
let the last person in, boy?

00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:17.330
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:17.330 --> 00:54:18.750
SHAWN STOCKMAN: It took her a
minute to bring it out, too.

00:54:18.750 --> 00:54:19.650
She was like, well--

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:20.720
NATHAN MORRIS: She
knew she was wrong.

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:22.178
SPEAKER: There's
a concert tonight.

00:54:22.178 --> 00:54:23.840
Concert tonight, Garfield Park.

00:54:23.840 --> 00:54:24.530
NATHAN MORRIS: Well,
go ahead, Shawn.

00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:26.190
Answer that question
first, and then we'll--

00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:28.560
SHAWN STOCKMAN: To answer
your question, you know what?

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:32.490
We might be the right guys for
that question, but actually

00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:36.320
the wrong guys, because
we're kind of unorthodox.

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:39.270
Our thing is, we do
things a little different.

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:41.827
Like the whole triad thing--

00:54:41.827 --> 00:54:43.410
NATHAN MORRIS: Out
the window with us.

00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:44.660
SHAWN STOCKMAN: We never did--

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:46.390
it was always too boring.

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.480
NATHAN MORRIS: We never--

00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:47.220
SHAWN STOCKMAN: So
it was almost like,

00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:49.186
when we would sing
a three-part--

00:54:49.186 --> 00:54:51.060
I'm not saying we wouldn't
sing those parts--

00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:52.530
WANYA MORRIS: Because it
would start off like that.

00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:54.405
SHAWN STOCKMAN: It would
start off like that,

00:54:54.405 --> 00:54:58.480
but then he would go in, add
what we call a crack note,

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:01.020
because it's in
the cracks, right?

00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:04.650
It kind of goes with maybe
the top, mid, or bottom,

00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:06.900
but it kind of does
a thing like this,

00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:09.830
that kind of goes in tandem
with that particular note.

00:55:09.830 --> 00:55:13.210
Then Nate will add a bass,
then I'll add some weird thing.

00:55:13.210 --> 00:55:18.500
So it's kind of like, if
anything, you do what you feel.

00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.590
It's a feel.

00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:23.160
And I think that's where
our style comes from.

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:26.570
It's not necessarily a
structure, but more of a feel.

00:55:26.570 --> 00:55:30.220
If there's a note that we
feel like should be in there,

00:55:30.220 --> 00:55:31.170
we put it in.

00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:35.580
Even if it's just like one
half of a bar, it'll go,

00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:37.000
and then it will disappear.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.700
So that's how we do our thing.

00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:42.400
WANYA MORRIS: And also, that's
the recording aspect of it,

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.730
but if you're actually
seeing us or hearing

00:55:44.730 --> 00:55:50.610
us perform a capella,
each part that we sing

00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:54.485
can actually be a
lead sung by itself.

00:55:54.485 --> 00:55:55.360
You know what I mean?

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:59.400
So if I start at one note,
by the end of the song,

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:02.940
I could actually end up
at a whole other note

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:04.620
and a whole other register.

00:56:04.620 --> 00:56:08.410
And he'll end up on a whole
other note at my register,

00:56:08.410 --> 00:56:09.895
and Shawn will be in the middle.

00:56:09.895 --> 00:56:10.770
You know what I mean?

00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:16.200
So it creates somewhat of a, I
guess you could say, somewhat

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.110
of a wave.

00:56:18.110 --> 00:56:23.370
And it does something,
but the idea and concept

00:56:23.370 --> 00:56:28.560
is to actually have it move,
so that the actual melody

00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:31.610
of the song can stay,
but it can move you.

00:56:31.610 --> 00:56:33.840
And you don't understand
where it's coming from.

00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:36.780
A lot of people might hear
a couple of our arrangements

00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:39.610
and say, how--

00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:42.060
what note is he
actually singing?

00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.560
And it's just unorthodox.

00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:45.060
NATHAN MORRIS: It's
all spontaneous.

00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:45.851
WANYA MORRIS: Yeah.

00:56:45.851 --> 00:56:46.542
And it's fun.

00:56:46.542 --> 00:56:48.000
It's fun to do it
the way we do it,

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.550
because we know that everybody
is scratching their heads.

00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:52.540
You know what I mean?

00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:53.541
That's kind of awesome.

00:56:53.541 --> 00:56:54.790
JOE MULVIHILL: I'll tell you--

00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:55.850
NATHAN MORRIS:
Yeah, there you go.

00:56:55.850 --> 00:56:57.870
JOE MULVIHILL: No, real
quick, when they record, one

00:56:57.870 --> 00:56:59.310
will jump in the
studio and record,

00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:00.570
and then Shawn
will say, hold on,

00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:03.090
and they'll jump out and jump in
and jump out, and they'll say,

00:57:03.090 --> 00:57:03.690
that wasn't right.

00:57:03.690 --> 00:57:04.230
No, that was right.

00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:04.890
No, do this.

00:57:04.890 --> 00:57:05.765
And it's fascinating.

00:57:05.765 --> 00:57:08.280
There's no keyboard, there's
no pitch pipe, there's nothing.

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:09.988
And that fascinated
me when I was first--

00:57:09.988 --> 00:57:11.910
we recorded with Brian
McKnight, and he's

00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:13.316
the same style as these guys.

00:57:13.316 --> 00:57:14.940
And they had a keyboard
and everything,

00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:16.560
and Brian's like, plug,
take that thing out.

00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:17.351
We don't need that.

00:57:17.351 --> 00:57:20.200
And they just find what
makes sense as they go.

00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:22.450
It's just-- it's a fascinating
thing to actually see.

00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:24.050
And if you're
musical, you get it.

00:57:24.050 --> 00:57:24.980
SHAWN STOCKMAN:
OK, and sweetheart,

00:57:24.980 --> 00:57:25.340
you've been waiting very--

00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:25.798
NATHAN MORRIS: All right.

00:57:25.798 --> 00:57:26.297

00:57:26.297 --> 00:57:27.630
SHAWN STOCKMAN: --patiently.

00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:28.040
NATHAN MORRIS: All right.

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.320
JOE MULVIHILL: I'll
put the mic down now.

00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:30.560
Go ahead guys,
you do your thing.

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:33.101
NATHAN MORRIS: I might need a
little bit more volume, though.

00:57:33.101 --> 00:57:34.730
One, two, hey, hi, hey, yeah.

00:57:44.215 --> 00:57:47.140

do the doo-doo doo da-da?

[LAUGHTER]

00:57:48.287 --> 00:57:49.870
WANYA MORRIS: She
didn't ask for that.

00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:51.320
You know how women are.

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:53.346
You got to give a
woman what they want.

00:57:53.346 --> 00:57:54.260
NATHAN MORRIS: It's
early in the day,

00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:56.010
so we'll switch it up
just a little bit so

00:57:56.010 --> 00:57:57.250
we save these for tonight.

00:57:57.250 --> 00:57:57.749

00:58:03.712 --> 00:58:05.420
[MUSIC - BOYZ II MEN, "END OF
 THE ROAD"]

00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:05.640
Hold on.

00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:07.140
Are we singing with
the mics or not?

00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:09.360
You got one and he doesn't.

00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.685
I mean, I wouldn't do it.

00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:15.820

00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:42.231
It'll be better tonight.

00:58:42.231 --> 00:58:44.187
WANYA MORRIS: We just woke up.

00:58:44.187 --> 00:58:46.143
[APPLAUSE]

00:58:48.961 --> 00:58:50.544
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Oh,
one more question.

00:58:50.544 --> 00:58:51.060
SPEAKER: Last question.

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:51.330
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Sorry.

00:58:51.330 --> 00:58:52.501
We got one more question.

00:58:52.501 --> 00:58:53.000
That's it.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.250
AUDIENCE: I almost don't
want to ask the question now.

00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:56.370
I can't--

00:58:56.370 --> 00:58:57.399
SPEAKER: Make it good.

00:58:57.399 --> 00:58:57.940
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:01.570
So my name is Charles
Olivier from Chicago.

00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:05.020
I recently made the
jump over to tech,

00:59:05.020 --> 00:59:06.880
but I started my
career in politics

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:09.010
with a couple of really
cool opportunities,

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:12.670
working for Obama in Chicago,
working for him in DC,

00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:14.410
and Hillary Clinton.

00:59:14.410 --> 00:59:17.710
And I recently made the
jump to come to Google

00:59:17.710 --> 00:59:20.920
after being the CFO of the
Democratic National Committee.

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:25.720
So my question is,
as black artists,

00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:27.370
what do you think about--

00:59:27.370 --> 00:59:29.980
what are your thoughts on
artists using their platform

00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:31.860
to be involved in
the political process

00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:33.610
or encouraging other
people to be involved

00:59:33.610 --> 00:59:35.700
in the political process?

00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:37.450
SHAWN STOCKMAN: I think
it's great, mainly

00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:39.970
because, I mean, let's face it.

00:59:39.970 --> 00:59:41.680
That's kind of a
historical thing.

00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:45.180
Artists have always done
that, from Bob Dylan

00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:47.710
all the way back to
all of these acts

00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:51.190
back in the '60s and
things of that nature.

00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:54.100
Artists are the closest
thing to people,

00:59:54.100 --> 00:59:56.230
closer than some politicians.

00:59:56.230 --> 01:00:01.570
And we get our message
across conveniently in a way

01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:07.410
where people are willing to
listen, because it sounds good.

01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:09.247
It has a melody to it,
has a guitar to it,

01:00:09.247 --> 01:00:10.330
and things of that nature.

01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:14.170
So we're able to put
across our message.

01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:17.500
And even when we were
growing up as high schoolers,

01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:20.830
you had guys like
Public Enemy and people

01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:23.890
like that, who put their
political message in music,

01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:26.980
too, but the beats was hot.

01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:31.024
And even now, Chicago native
Chance the Rapper and guys

01:00:31.024 --> 01:00:32.690
like that, who are
doing the same thing.

01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:36.070
And I think it's
incredible, because we

01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:42.280
have the purest, most honest
way of conveying the message,

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.630
because there's no filter.

01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:45.940
And because we're
not politicians,

01:00:45.940 --> 01:00:48.910
people can be comfortable
with our message,

01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:52.780
because they know that there's
no ulterior motive behind it

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:53.950
or whatever.

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:55.720
We say what's in our heart.

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.910
We say what we feel,
and most of the time

01:00:57.910 --> 01:01:01.060
it's the same sentiment that
most of us share anyway.

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.630
The same thing comedians do,
and things of that nature.

01:01:03.630 --> 01:01:08.140
We're just modern day
Platos and Socrates

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:10.550
and people like that who
used to say the same thing.

01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:11.800
So I think it's awesome.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.720
And I think there are
more people that need

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:16.750
to do that, especially now.

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:21.100
This is such a volatile time,
specifically in this country,

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:24.670
that we have to have more
artists and more people

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:26.620
to express themselves
artistically

01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:27.730
to get the point across.

01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:32.470
Where if no one understands the
political jargon and vernacular

01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:34.209
that you might see
on CNN or MSNBC--

01:01:34.209 --> 01:01:36.000
NATHAN MORRIS: Just
sing "End of the Road."

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.780

01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:38.530
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:39.029
Thank you.

01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:41.290
Also, I forgot to tell
you, I got a beat down

01:01:41.290 --> 01:01:43.870
when I was about 10 for
pulling the tape out

01:01:43.870 --> 01:01:46.244
of the "Evolution" album,
my mom's "Evolution" album.

01:01:46.244 --> 01:01:47.299
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Ooh.

01:01:47.299 --> 01:01:49.924
NATHAN MORRIS: Well, we probably
would have beat you down, too.

01:01:49.924 --> 01:01:50.810
SHAWN STOCKMAN: Yeah.

01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:52.518
NATHAN MORRIS: Glad
she got to you first.

01:01:52.518 --> 01:01:53.654
Thank you.

01:01:56.114 --> 01:01:57.590
SPEAKER: All right.

01:01:57.590 --> 01:02:01.910
So I think I speak for all of
us when I say that we love you,

01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:05.890
we support you, we were
so fortunate to get

01:02:05.890 --> 01:02:07.367
to know the men
behind the music,

01:02:07.367 --> 01:02:08.450
and we thank you for that.

01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:12.790
Let's give it up for Nathan,
Shawn, Wanya, and Joe!
