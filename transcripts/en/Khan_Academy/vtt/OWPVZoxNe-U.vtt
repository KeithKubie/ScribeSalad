00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.720
Luis and Kate have two video
games they want to play.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.620
They plan to spend exactly 45
minutes playing the two games.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.900
They want to use an
equation to express

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.010
the relationship between the
number of minutes they spend

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.140
playing Super Bologna Man
and the number of minutes

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.550
they spend playing You
Have to Cut the Wire.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.870
Can this relationship
be represented

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.370
using a linear equation?

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.299
So let's see if it can.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.220
Let's define one variable
for the amount of time,

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.380
the number of minutes they
spend playing Super Bologna Man.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.010
Let's define that as, well
let's just say that's x.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.420
So x is equal to time
playing Bologna Man.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.700
I'll write Bologna right here.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.870
And let's define y as y is
equal to the number of minutes

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.340
they spend playing You
Have to Cut the Wire.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:14.592
So it's time playing, I'll
just call it Wire for short.

00:01:14.592 --> 00:01:16.050
So if we have the
minutes they play

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.660
time playing Bologna and the
time playing Cut Your Wire.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.970
If I were to add those two
together, so if I say x plus y.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.420
I'll write that plus in a
neutral color, x plus y.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.640
What does this need
to be equal to?

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.970
The time I play Bologna
Man plus the time

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.820
I play Have to Cut the Wire.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.610
Well if I add them
together, they

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.230
want to spend exactly 45
minutes playing both games.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.760
So this is going to be
equal to 45 minutes.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.130
Now we have set up
an equation that

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.360
relates the time playing
Bologna Man and the time

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.730
playing You Have
to Cut the Wire.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.010
But now we have to think about
is this a linear relationship?

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.370
So one way to think about
it is the real giveaway

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.490
for a linear relationship
is if you can write it

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.750
in the traditional
form of a line.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.360
So if you can write
it in the y is

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.590
equal to mx plus b form, where
m is the slope of the line

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.920
and b is the y-intercept.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.980
So let's see if we can do that.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.850
Well if we want to
do that here, we

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.010
could just subtract
x from both sides.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.600
You subtract x from
both sides, you

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.750
get-- so let's
subtract an x over

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.660
here, let's subtract
an x over here.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.320
So negative x plus this and
then subtract an x there.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.000
Well, that's going
to cancel, and you're

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.930
going to be left
with-- and I'm going

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.240
try to write it in this
form right over here--

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.727
y is equal to 45.

00:02:44.727 --> 00:02:46.310
Let me do that in
the same color, just

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.820
to make it not be confusing.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.500
y is equal to, and I'll
write the negative x first

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.750
because we have the x term
right over here first.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.335
So y is equal to
negative x plus 45.

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.910
All I did is I switched
these two terms around.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.370
But you see here,
it has that form.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.000
And you might say
wait what is m here?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.900
I see that b is 45.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.540
Well if I write
negative x, that's

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.940
the same thing as
writing negative 1x.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.730
So this is definitely a line.

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.350
I was able to write it in
this form right over here.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.470
So can this relationship
be represented

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.290
using a linear equation?

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.611
Absolutely, absolutely yes.
