00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Okay, so we're in the Sprint mode here - the second of the Beta Sprints,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
an amazing group represented by Rachel Frick

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and some colleagues coming up on stage.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
There's someone who has not been mentioned yet,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but deserves it, Don Waters,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
he was a founding member of the steering committee

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and he made a grant to CLIR and company to develop this

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Beta Sprint but I think it speaks to the model to develop for the DPLA

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of course that the system itself is supported

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and we need to sustain that, but also grants might be made to

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
partner organizations to do things like what Rachel and crew have done.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Thank you for this great opportunity and of course,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I am embarrassed by making my colleagues stand

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
while I've ramble on for seven minutes.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I'm Rachel Frick, and I'm the director of the Digital Library Federation at the

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Council of Library and Information Resources

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and I'm happy to talk about the CLIR-DLF/IMLS DCC Beta Sprint

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
full of acronyms, let's go. Basically, what we started with,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
is building a metadata aggregation that represented

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
thousands of cultural heritage collections across the US.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We did this by combining existing data collections -

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
one of them being the IMLS DCC,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and IMLS is the Institute of Museum and Library Services.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
This was started to provide a single point of access

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
to the content that was funded by the IMLS.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Another resource that we used was another collection,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
metadata collection called Opening History.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
This is an aggregation that is guided by a clearly defined

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
collection of policy unit and it builds off the DCC content

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
but it's a base of history collections that extends

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
beyond the funded content to include other content aggregations.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We used those two collections of aggregations plus others

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to build our DPLA prototype.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
What resulted was a collection of metadata that

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
represented 1400 collections of over 1 million items from

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
over 1200 institutions in 44 states

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and we were grateful to the chief officers of state

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
library agencies to help coordinate some of this content.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
As a result, our scope broadened as result of the variety of

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
collecting institutions that contributed to this

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
aggregation as you can see here.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Our work has also been informed by a strong body of research on information seeking

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
in libraries, archives and digital collections

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
as well as research on metadata data quality and collection.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
One of the problems with large aggregation, retaining a rich collection content

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and helping users comprehend the sea of items

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
that lie behind a single search box.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
These are technical and conceptual problems that grow as your aggregation grows.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
But at the same time, when you aggregation grows

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
You're able to surface new national strengths within this

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
collective collection and bring to the surface small

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
collections otherwise might be hidden.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Our particular aggregation collection had this

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
particular topical strings including the local history of cities

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and towns throughout the US, military history,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Civil War and World War II, arts, Native American history,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
architecture, women's history, and agriculture and ranching.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Our prototype allows users to search within a vast array

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
of cultural heritage that has been digitized over the last few decades.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Collections and their metadata are key to providing people with intellectual

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and navigational context for it especially as they

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
explore and evaluate materials.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Collections in and of themselves are meaningful organizational units that

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
can bring coherence and functionality to amass individual items.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And like -- systems that tend to lose this type of

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
collection context, we actually try to exploit that.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
We preserve that I don't with this collection context.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
That is often lost in the flatter searches.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
In Beta Sprint, we also provided an opportunity for users to link to

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and make use of secondary sources.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
So here is where everyone from the University of Illinois is

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000
going to take a collective deep breath, because I'm going to a live demonstration here.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I really wanted to show you some of the great work.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
We're highlighting collections up in our banner and here is a link to our cute little video,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and over here you can see the number of items, collections

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and institutions represented in this aggregation

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And these are live links you can click.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
You can also navigate by states and here you can see Utah,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
we have 70 collections there, Arizona, 84.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
I don't know what is going on with the Dakotas,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
but we're working on it.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I am doing a shout out to the Dakotas.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Also, you can browse by date

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and the colors represent the density of objects

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and so the more objects we have,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
the darker the colors and you can search by item type

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and have also drawn us of other things like entries from

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
-- which we highlight different items in the collection.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And you can find us on Flickr. That being done,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
I'm going to go back to,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I am not going to do a search because I have two minutes

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
but we encourage you to go to our Beta Sprint site

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and search for yourself.  That being said,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
it is beyond just our website and prototype

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and aggregation there is also a lot of research,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
novel and innovative ways of visualizing analyzing connecting

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
aggregations to user services ongoing process happening.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
One of the examples is the idea of topic modeling to help

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
us refine and analyze metadata.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
The other area of interest, they think is interesting,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
how does this connect us to think of the data world?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Currently aggregation serves hundreds of cultural

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
heritage collection level descriptions

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and item records available through OAI PMH rate into

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
large organizations that link to the data,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
they can help you extract larger cultural heritage

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
community by publishing collection level descriptions

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and links open data client formats by connecting these

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
descriptions to existing open data sources this

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
aggregation serves as a bridge to collections which are

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
currently hidden for the link stated in our great state

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
great example of a service the data can do besides being centralized.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
All right then without color line to stop open for

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
questions. Here is the first URL to Beta Sprint

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and the one below us to our project website that has a lot of documentation

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and further information about our activities.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
We want to thank the IMLS

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
for their support for digital collections and research and aggregation,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000
none of this work would have been possible. So thank you.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:33.000
[Applause]

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Questions?

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
My question is,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
there are a lot of cultural institutions in the United

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
States. And this is an example,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.000
there is a small public library is organized by the mayonnaise system.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And I am wondering if you had a screening process for he

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
was included in your project.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
If there is an international association of crackpots,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
for example, would you link to them?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
I will answer that and you can correct me.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
The aggregation,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
it was IMLS funded projects that got the inclusion

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and Opening History has a collection of policy that you can

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
link to that is very important to have a huge aggregation,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
with what you include what you are talking about so there

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
are things outlined in that collection

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and right now the TP alleges not have a collection

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
development policy that we have a content

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and scope of work stream to help guide the content is

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
going to be other going to have updates from the work

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
stream this afternoon to help answer your question.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I had it back unfair it is actually,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:20.000
DPLA for the Beta Sprint to look at the site it is  DPLA . Granger.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:28.000
.Illinois.EDU.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000
DPLA,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
there is a blogger page  that has hit list of all of the

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Beta Sprint that have been made public

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and to encourage everyone to find all of them as well.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:51.000
RIP -- all right. Sorry you don't get to answer questions.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
You can reach us on the Internet, like you said.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Thanks. [Applause]
