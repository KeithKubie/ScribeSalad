Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Again. Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday. Monday morning podcast.

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       and ahhh

Speaker 1:          00:00:12       just checking in on you, just checking. Can I stop doing that people? I don't have any new way of doing it. Can I just say I'm just checking on you. I'm going to do that for awhile and every once in awhile I'll screen. Okay. It'll make it special. Um, anyways, as you're heard, the, uh, the laughter in the background, uh, we're welcoming the lovely Nia to the Thursday afternoon podcast just before Friday. Um, um, and you wanted to clear your name so to speak, for drugging the man you allegedly love. I didn't drug you. You took it voluntarily. No, I didn't get, yes, you're taught, you're taught while you're talking to me. You ain't doing nothing because I didn't like flipping into your fucking cornflakes or whatever. Okay. I asked you if you wanted and you were like, all right, you fucking, you're just a lay liar. I'm not alive.

Speaker 1:          00:01:02       What do you mean liar? How many times did you ask me to take it before I actually took the fuck? I don't remember. See that's the magical powers of the pocket. No, you'll be a pulling of Ronald Reagan right now. I'm really magically erases. I don't remember. Probably a couple times now. It's like, I don't want to do that. It's going to get me all fucked up. And you said no, no, no. This is mellow. Yes, I did say that. Oh, this is coming back to you now. Yeah. Yeah. And then like flat grounds. It was a mellow, but you're kind of a lightweight when it comes to the we. Yeah. So, well, yeah. One day if you didn't drink at all, I wouldn't be like, hey, have a couple of fucking Yeager's. That's nothing. Tastes like syrup. I wouldn't do that to you. I'd let you sip on a beer or something. Here is disgusting. Get your like a wine cooler. Not for nothing. Wine cooler as our wine coolers, I used to drink those James puck cookies. Don't, don't really taste sector do they? They definitely taste more like weed than cookie. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       And Yeager definitely tastes more like Jaeger than licorice. Well, I would just like to w which is a gross too. Why do people, is that what Yeager is out there? Bass note, I forgot to talk in like perfume terms like you're talking in musical sense. No, I've gotta be honest with you. I don't even know what, I don't even know what it is. It's disgusting. It's like what is it considered a vomit? I never, I never I liquor isn't it now I all, I know the core, it's just, it's one of those things that like when I was first living in New York and we'd go hang out at this awful bars on the upper east side with a bunch of like banker kids and young stockbrokers and Frat boys, I were like, let's have heavy Yeager. And then inevitably they'd put on, you know, living on a prayer and everyone would say it was the most horrifying experience and I hate those kinds of bars and I hate that kind of vibe for that reason.

Speaker 1:          00:02:53       And I feel like if I got talked into doing a Yeager shot with Shane, I'm trying to go along and have fun. It would just be the thing that put me over and to, to vomitorium. So Yeager is not disco. It's for people who don't know how to drink. Well this is what it really is though. What is it? The people in around the world probably drink it differently than we do. Okay. Yeager meister is a German digestif so this is like, you have like a big meal. You said that that makes sense in France. Yeah. Made with 56 herbs and spices at a strength of 35% alcohol by volume, whatever the flow, whatever, 35%. I mean that's a lot. No wonder people mainline it like fucking white China. But a couple of drag references in there for you. What's white shines that heroin think I think, I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:03:46       Why are you, um, oh, there you go. It's a digestive so it's not supposed to. Uh, you're not supposed to be doing what people are doing with it. 35% alcohol too. That it makes a lot of sense. I would just also like to say in terms of the, the edible does that a lot. By the adjusted it is a lot. Um, the edible that you ingested, it was cut into fours as is recommended. It's not like you ate the entire cookie. So I want people to understand that it wasn't like you got the whole entire thing. Oh yeah, yeah. But still, I mean a lightweight like me need you. I was like fucking tripping. He would 70 proof. That's what Jaeger is. That's also insanely high. Oh, this is not 70 proof. I mean it's up there. It's a shot. We'll look, let me just, let me just, I'm like Jack Daniels let, let's see. I'd like to know these old Jack. Oh my buddy. Your Buddy Jack Daniel. My buddy. I visited him the other night. I only, I only talked to him once so I usually have a long conversation that slowly dissolves into tears.

Speaker 1:          00:04:53       You know what I mean? Jack, do you like Jamison? Uh, yeah I do. It's all right. I don't once, once your fancy and I want you to become a snob. Yeah. Jamie's like, I go when I'm in the mood yet when I want to get fucking hammered James, you know, if I want to have like, you know something nice and pretend I actually am cultured, I'll go with more of a scotch or something like that. For the fact that stuff that you have that's in that like suitcase looking thing. That coffin. Yeah. What does that, that blue stuff is that Johnny Walker blue? It's like a half gallon of Johnny Walker blue. They don't even, a lot of it, I don't even sell that bottle. When I went in and bought it, they had it in their liquor store for 10 years and [inaudible] was coming out here. So I was like, I gotta get this thing. I'm just laughing. Like the label's different. The thing, it's the sickest fucking [inaudible] suitcase. It's like, it's so pretty. Like it's leather and it's like, really? What's that other one that's really fancy when you really have dedicated to damn damaging your liver? What's another one you have that's really fancy that you haven't even drank yet? You've had it here for like three years. Pappy van Winkle. Right. Did you break that up and when Paul Versey was here? No, we did what I put, I drank, I drank pappies with him in a,

Speaker 3:          00:05:58       what the hell are we? Nashville. So it's here, but you just haven't drank a yeah, I'm just waiting for that right time when all everybody's over, you know, to break it open. And uh, when would that be? I don't know. In other words, you want a shot? I'll, I'll open and try like, I want to try that shot. When we went to the, what was at the Polo Lounge and we had that, that fancy shit that you were dying to get, which stunk. Yeah. You were like, Eh. What was that Lou? Louis the 14th 13th or something like that. Nine zillion dollars in. It's stunk. I've had better, I bet. Better cognacs and that one comes out. That one's a, that one's like totally like a, that's like the boy band of cognacs. It's which one? Cause everybody who doesn't know anything about it like me fucking sees.

Speaker 3:          00:06:40       No though the Konya, there's a lot of snobs that say pappies is for the prices. Fucking overrated. But uh, it's still delicious though. The way to get all of those is just to buy the shine. If you go out and buy the bottle, you're an asshole, which I am. You know what I mean? They're completely overpriced. But it's fun when you have people come over and you break out the bottle, it sits a nice thing to do as a host. But if you just going to, you shouldn't have a buy a bottle of that just for yourself and then just sit there. That's what I mean. I guess you're saving money. Sat there for like a few years now. You gotta you gotta break it out. You know the old me, when I, when this, how ignorant I was with and I'm still don't know much about this shit.

Speaker 3:          00:07:17       All right, so save you fucking Cunty tweets. Can you just in a, in a nice polite way, be like, actually it's not 30% alcohol. How that fuck, cause I know it's not 30% alcohol, it's like 30% of something, Blah Blah Blah. Some egg heads. We were Doris, you know like just as a human being, you're supposed to know everything, right? You know you're into math and booze. So you know the answer to that. You know, I know the answer to other things. I lovely bartender or mixologist perhaps listening who actually really knows and it's not going to just like, I don't want to talk to a mixologist cause I don't like that word. That was, that's right up there with footie. Right. I'm 40 which I've even said. And then after a while it's like, you know, I don't like E. I don't like that at the end.

Speaker 3:          00:08:02       Food Lilly. I'm a foodie. I'm a mixologist. So what about can bartender, what about this deal hard? It has to be a bartender though. Can you imagine switching places with a bartender? I went on a really busy night. It's like, it looks, I work on restaurant industry. Yes. Were you a bartender? No. But at one point I worked the, I worked at grill with one of those tall chef I was last and I was the busboy and I washed dishes all at the same time. It was like a fucking Carol Burnett sketch. The restaurant was going out of business and initially I was just the bus boy and a dishwasher. And then they had this guy working the grill and a, I remember he quit or got fired. He used to just get hammered and dry. He had a van and used to just take restaurant panel, the restaurant business fucking nuts.

Speaker 3:          00:08:50       Right. And this guy used to drive this van and he came in one day and just had this fucking like somebody just took a belt and diagonally smacked him across his forehead. And what happened was he was driving home to his parent's house and he pulled any was so shit faced t they hit one of their cars or the tree and when his head went to slam against the windshield, the visor was down a little bit and he like bent it. And that was one of those old school like metal ones. He bent it with his head, um, which was probably traveling a good 25 miles an hour when he hit it. And, um, so anyway, he got fired. So then they had me, uh, flip the burgers. Yeah. Ashley Brochette and that type of shit. No, I think I became a dishwasher and the bus boy yet it was just like a bacon wrapped shrimp that was seasoned.

Speaker 3:          00:09:37       And uh, so I would, I would fucking set up the tables and the lunch rush would come in, which wasn't much of a rush. We were going out of business, but I would be sitting there cooking shit trying to look suave. Like this was his fancy fucking place, which it wasn't cause I was on the grill and I was sort of eyeballing the lunchroom, waiting for people to finish. And as I saw people finishing up, I would sort of casually duct down where they couldn't see me like below the grill. Like I was, uh, you know, getting more food or something. And I would pop up in, my apron would be off. I had the bow tie, the whole busboy thing on underneath the apron. And I take the hat off and I would run out there plus the table, bring the dishes back, rinse them, set them up and then I would run back, flip the fucking burger and then go back out and set the table in case somebody else came out. Oh my God. And then I would go back. Yeah. I ended up burning a guy's hand.

Speaker 3:          00:10:30       Cause from this stress, I remember I made a burger. I've told this story before I made this fucking Burger. Knows this kid Jason, this Metallica Fan. Jesus Christ. Clear. Holy Shit. Woo. She been out today. Yeah, I let her out. This letting her out. She doesn't shit. She just peas. She should go for a stroll. I think she's farting cause she's dead ass asleep. Yeah, but she doesn't care if she shits in the house. She doesn't have to clean it up. Look at her though. She's passed out. Woo Cleo. I put a bed right by the, by the window where the sun comes in and that's the, I have to go soon. So can we talk about this Jamison thing, how much or whatever Jack Daniels you are. And I promise everyone I'll finish the story about burning the guy's hand. Oh, right. Sorry. Um, what was it you were looking up? How much proof is, uh, okay. Uh, oh Jesus Christ. Come on man. I just asked the question. Oh, Jack Daniels. I just won't inject Daniels. I should write proof. That helps you go to the Wikipedia page. Can we also talk about how your social media game needs to step it up a little bit? It's 80 proof. That seems like a lot too. Well, Jameson is only 70 proof. Like what it is about Jamison is it is you're drinking something. You supposed to sip something that you're drinking,

Speaker 1:          00:11:54       that you're fucking slamming and then they do a bunch of them. And it's really the, I mean, I would think that the, the, the sugar is just off the fucking charts for them. Remember the first time I ever had Jamieson was when we were in, when you did a show in Dublin, our first time in Ireland. And you know, I fucking love Ireland and I love the people there that go. And then you'd be shit. Oh my God. It was, it was the, that was the first time because you know, I don't drink beer. That was when that guy gave you shit, right? Yeah. When we were leaving, we stand on a street corner. This Irish guy is on a bicycle, riders every European seems to be, and he came up, got a little turned around trying to find our hotel. And I went, I'm so am I, so let me just ask this guy. And I said, um, excuse me, Sarah, do you know where at such and such is? He just pauses and he looks at me and he goes, I do.

Speaker 1:          00:12:41       And he's still staring at me and I look at you and I'm like, um, are you gonna tell me? I'm like, yeah, I remember you laughed. And he laughed, won me over and you were like, well, you're going to tell me. And he's like, I'm like a moist. And then he told me and it was all going to gave me like a big smile and I was like, are you fucking Irish? But you know you Irish men, you like, you like black women. So I feel like maybe that was part of it too. I think we like women in general. I feel like everybody likes black women though. Like the, like everybody likes me. Let's just go off on a nice ego trip. But [inaudible] your social immediate like, so I seeing me do Snapshat are you not into doing snapchat? Not at all. Why or Instagram? You have an Instagram. I'm not into Twitter. I'm not into like going on Facebook. I don't like any social. You go there. Can we talk about you just go there because you I have to do it or else you, your career just dies. And that's where everybody's at. So you've gotta be there. Everybody's at snapchat now. All are there. Yeah, they are. Oh you horse. We'll be back.

Speaker 1:          00:13:48       You guys see your social media whores. You just run it around the block. It's true. It's like, it's fun. Those fucking club kids. They go to this spot, the spots, the spot. Then everybody's there and then they run across the street to the new spot. And it's the same fucking people. Just a different background. Um, okay. Isn't that what it is? I haven't got that new clubs. Speaker. Oh grandpa. I never had. What else? Don't you understand? But how come you're not doing Instagram? You take pictures all the time. Why don't you ever cause they're nuts for people there for me. Oh, I see. Although there's a couple of killer ones from how great were the pictures from Dean Del Rey's 50th birthday party. Amazing. You fucking MSD. I missed it. I missed it. That's true. I'm sorry, Dean. Happy Birthday. Dean del Ray. He's an entrepreneur, was one of s, I don't know how you taught this. This fucking guy turns 50 years old. He packs out the El Rey theater. His name is Dean del Ray. So it was Delray at the El Ray. Right. So he goes out there. It

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       was Joe Barton x hosting wearing an ACDC fucking one at like a Hawaiian shirt. But it's an ACDC shirt. Right. He brings up red bed, red bed, fucking kills it. Then it was Dee del Ray who fucking murdered one of the best sets I've ever seen a map. Then Krista, Leah, then Joe Rogan. And then I had to follow all those fucking monsters. Right. And then after that he had a live band came out and he sang the entire highway to hell album. He's such a great fucking, yeah, when I tell you he fucking crushed it. Yeah. Like first of all, the song that they opened with was a live wire now for ACDC maniacs. I didn't even know this. They all went bond. Scott was still alive. Their original singer, they always opened with livewire on all their live shows. And when he died in tribute to him, they retired the song and they didn't even play it in concert for like fucking 30 years until recently.

Speaker 3:          00:15:48       They started playing it again. So because he was playing, um, the highway to hell album, which was the last bond Scott album. He also has the sickest fucking tattoo on his side of bond Scott's face, which I know sounds cheesy, but if you see it, it's fucking costumer. If it's good, it's on funding. Believable. Okay. Cause otherwise it's unbelievable. I haven't people's like famous people's spaces on you unless that is a fun, no, it's unreal. Amazing Tattoo. I remember when Jim Florentine was down the store, I had to show him like, dude, you got to see this cause Florentines obviously you know that metal show. I was like, you gotta see this? And he goes again, he's got a bond. Scott Tattoo. And I saw it in his face like out and then he saw it. He was just like, next thing you know they're off in a corner talking about eighties metal. Did they play this song when we went to CAC ACDC all those years ago? I don't remember if they played. Yeah. So anyways, so here's the funny thing. I go on last and what's his face dean? So when you finish your set, just go like, ah, you guys ready for some rock, whatever. Right? You ready for some rocks?

Speaker 1:          00:16:45       You got? Oh, you rating. And then I fought. So right then the [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:16:51       Bam was supposed to kick in and Rudy Sarto from fucking a quiet ride. Ozzy Osborne was this company. I do do, do, do, do, do they begin the fucking song? I didn't realize that. They didn't know that that's what was gonna happen. So nobody was on the stage and I didn't know, turn around. It looks like

Speaker 1:          00:17:07       you said rock and roll. I was like, you guys ready? Put some rock and roll. No, I, yeah, I turned around. There was nobody there and I was like, it's going up for a few minutes.

Speaker 3:          00:17:21       Longest walk ever. And I get off. So anyways, they start off with fucking livewire and Delray kind of sounds like Bon Scott and he's fine. He's fucking murders. And then they played the whole highway to hell album. [inaudible] um, then they ended, uh, they brought out,

Speaker 4:          00:17:39       um, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:17:42       hang on a second. Sorry. I almost knocked my computer off. Then they bring up Dave Lombardo

Speaker 4:          00:17:48       from a,

Speaker 1:          00:17:50       I'm fucking going blank here. I'm trying to name his new fucking band. Dead Cross. Okay. Slayer. Obviously he goes out, he plays a let there be rock and then they played, um, they played Motorhead, ace of spades and fucking Dean like channeled Lemmy. It was fucking unbelievable. Can I tell you like when you missed it, I sat in on two songs. I played get it hot and if you will, what is so enjoyable about being with you amongst other things but like with being with the money, that's really great tip when you leave. But um, no it's like being with someone who is so different from you. Like obviously we're an interracial couple, there's a bit of an age difference between, oh Jesus, she just kicked me with rights and left here. I know, but the thing is like I learned so much stuff about things I wouldn't normally know.

Speaker 1:          00:18:38       Like, I like rock music and stuff, but like you know, your dedication to it and like your childhood or your like being a teenager, the stuff that really moves you is like nothing I ever would have considered before. And people always make fun of like hair, metal and all those bands that you like legitimately loves. And when you talk about the musicianship and the like the trace of guns was there from, from La guns. Yeah, like all that kind of stuff that I've seen documentaries about like oh the English noser the composer F is for family music and from person and from velvet revolver. Yes. All that kind of stuff. Like since I've been with you, I've seen Michael, Michael, Devin from Whitesnake, I've seen ACDC, we saw a velvet revolver, we saw food fighters, we've seen, um, I'm sure there's some further volts them crooked vultures.

Speaker 1:          00:19:31       Um, what's, oh what the band that Josh is in Queen of the Stone Age. Oh yeah. Jesus Christ. Like all these rock shows that I never would have seen if I was not with you. And I think that's really fucking cool cause I already like all different kinds of words now. I really, I saw Erica Badu with the roots. Yup. We saw Bruno and for hours I wouldn't see that. Yeah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't even go on scene. Uh, speaking of white music, I want to go see a drink your big black cow and get outta here. Oh, steely Dan. Yeah, that's right. I wouldn't have seen them. And that was one of the sickest fucking live shows. It was so amazing at the Hollywood bowl. And that's my dad. My Dad was into his, into steely Dan. So uh, yeah, no, we've gone to see some, we got to see some live music coming up this year.

Speaker 1:          00:20:18       That's one of the things we like to do. I've seen so many. I actually like seen like the smaller ones. I saw arrivals son and that was somebody that Dean del Ray told me about. I love them. They're great. Really fucking great. I saw him in his little ass club. They gotta be in a bigger place now cause I've heard, I heard them on the radio recently. Um, they'll plug in some big show that they were doing, but like the lead singers just got to fucking force. It's ridiculous in their drummers and saying, who is the guy when we, when you did that Rhonda as kiss charity that Mark McGrath hosted. Great guy by the way. So the first time I ever had a pickle back was with Mark McGrath, a little shot of Jamison and a pickle back. Disgusting. I'll never do it again. But he swears by it, but okay.

Speaker 1:          00:20:59       So it was, he was there for two to somebody, random person in the crowd. He goes, he goes, what'd you say sir? Sing it number one song that you wrote in 1997. Absolutely. Then he signed that. I just want to fly. I thought everybody in there was singing like the, all the lyrics to it. Um, but he a very funny self deprecating go. Yeah. Navarro was there. Juliette Lewis Casha but there were other bad deaf mckagan was there obviously, um, guns and roses. And then who else was there? There was some other Gilby cluck, I don't know who that is. He was one of the guitars to guns and roses. Second generation of guns commissioner was, they had Billy idol showed up at the ends. Even Billy idol. Steven, Steve Stevens. Um, no, that was Trump's by the way. Who? You don't know him but you know him cause he's played on for everything from like devote in nine inch nails.

Speaker 1:          00:21:52       Oh really? Okay. Yeah, probably with Menudo at some point. You know, we did some sort of fucking studio thing with them. Like fuck it. I'll make it sound good. He's like one of those guys you could just, no matter what it is. Yeah, he's played with fucking everybody. All right. I got to get going. Are you getting at it going, oh Nia, y'all gone to jail? Yeah, I'm going to the gym now and right now and then yoga tonight, but I won't, I'm dedicated. I'm saying it on the podcast now. I said on my snapchat, I'm going to say it on my, on the Napa chat on the podcast. I love snapchat. I'm going to do yoga every day. This month, 29 days. I'm kind of cheating, but while you're kind of cheating, well it's a full like 30 31 days. So I feel like I'm kind of cheating.

Speaker 1:          00:22:34       But you know, it's a, it's black history month. So I mean, I'm just saying years ago I wouldn't have been allowed to go into a yoga studio. You weren't alone. I wasn't allowed so I gotta do and go back far enough. You weren't allowed to even read the word Yoga. Exactly. So now I have to say this is by far and away the widest Shit I've ever done is to do yoga every day and talk about rock music. Yeah. Yeah. Today is topping it. But that's okay. I love it. I love you. I feel so clear ethnic today, like a loader, a Burrito or something to try to balance it off. I don't know if that's something that you want to say that you're doing that, but food, I guess it is, I guess is, there's so much though. How is that not ethnic food? I guess.

Speaker 1:          00:23:23       You know what makes something ethnic food isn't why I'm saying can you stop with that? You just said something fucked up. Tone Jesus Christ, and I tell him, you fucking say anything. I just said I'm going to get the Burrito. Was it God damn joke? Will I look because say that in during election year told me that there is so much Mexican food that they don't really eat in Mexico, that they are just sort of developed for us. Gringos. Although I don't think I'm a Gringo. You're definitely doing, yeah. Yeah, yeah. The same way that if we fucking, if we moved down there, we'd fucking weed lighten up the steak or something. It's just the way it goes. All right, burrito. We, we, we'd have to adjust our shit. We'd have to throw more spice into the cornflakes so they wouldn't buy our sh bland shit down there.

Speaker 1:          00:24:04       Our European underseas in food land. Fuck. Most boring ass cereal is cornflakes. Yeah, but you know what this saw in corn flag, the solid, the points, the solid and you're like, okay. And like 30 minutes later you're hungry. All right. I've got a question for you. Name is cereal with a point. Oatmeal. It's not a cereal. It is the hot cereal. No, it isn't. Yeah, it's considered a cereal. Look it up. What do you want to bet? I don't know. It's a porridge is I like that there's enough people out there in the war. Ended many wheats. Is oatmeal healthy? Let me see if I'm anybody else? Who's dumb enough? Is oatmeal a theory? A carb, a grain, a starch, a whole grain complex. Car. Alkaline. A good source of fiber. Acidic. It's harbor a cereal. Way down the bottom. So someone did have this question. See it pops up.

Speaker 3:          00:39:44       So as I was stating, uh, I've told this story before, but I already started. If you new to the podcast, I'll tell it. You see. Anyways, I'm working the sable cafe in Cary, North Carolina. It's 1987 going into 88. Alright. I probably just got done seeing Tesla opening up for a, it was either Eric Smith on the permanent vacation tour or it was def leopard on the hysteria tour. Remember Joe Elliot or those acid watch rip pants the entire tour and through all of the videos, you know, he went, Jim Morrison, what? Jim Morrison wore the same leather pants. He wore the same acid washed, ripped fucking jeans. You know, and I'll tell you this right now, the man knows how to pack. All right. Plowing ahead. By the way, I always heard Jim Florentine really knows how to pack, drop it his name twice in this podcast. I always heard he's one of those guys goes away for three weeks.

Speaker 3:          00:40:40       It'll show up with like a fucking a knapsack and like a cheese sandwich and a brown paper bag and he's just fucking good. I'd like to be more like that there. I can admit that I'm old enough now to say I'd like to be more like Jim Flora. Um, anyways, so I work in the sable cafe. So, uh, how it works is I'm glassed in, right? And right behind me is that little window and behind the window is the kitchen, right? And there's the line. So this order comes in, they're like, you know this guy, Jason's like, oh, we're up for a burger. Right? So my guy, what Barbara coming up, you know, so I'm supposed to look at the order and if there's a lot of shit on the line, you know, if they've got a bump, basically a bunch of entrees to make, I hold off on the Burger so we can time it all out.

Speaker 3:          00:41:24       So it's already, I wasn't thinking because I'm busing tables and washing dishes while not washing my hand. Total health code violation. Right. I shouldn't have said that. Now that I said the name, the restaurant, but it's all gone anyways. Um, so I just start making this burger. So, you know, I'm cause I'm watching the tables, like I gotta finish this Burger Cause I got to go bust that fucking table and throw some dishes into the fucking dishwasher a, by the way, I also mopped the whole fucking oyster bar and clean out both bathrooms before I fucking start. Brutal. Right. And, uh, so I just start making the burger. I put it on a plate and I'm like, Jason Burger up. And he turns around and looks at me and he's got his heavy metal hair shoved up into a chef hat and he use one of those guys that grew a mustache before he could grow one.

Speaker 3:          00:42:06       And he just looks at me, he's like, dude, what the fuck? And I like seven on trace here. I'm like, God, I'm sorry. So just fucking put it on the grill to put it to the side of the grill. So I grabbed it with tongs, it was a glass plate and I just set it on the, on basically on the grill, but underneath the burner that was off, you know, but just basically, you know, it's a mesquite grill, so you know, it's hot because the one, the burner two three over is hot, you know, it's all the same piece of metal. So it's basically hot, but not piping hot. Okay. But it's still fucking pretty hot. Uh, so I go out and I bus a fucking table, right. And I, I wash them dishes and I come in and all of a sudden I've got all these other orders for chicken sandwiches and [inaudible] and I leave the burger in there.

Speaker 3:          00:42:46       I'm not even fucking thinking. So Jason finally finishes two fucking entrees and he looks, he goes, he just goes, Bro, what's up with that Burger? And I just grabbed it with the tongs and he has both his hands out to receive this thing and I just set it right down on his hands and he just goes, hey. And fucking spun around and like basically threw it down on the, on the, on like the wood fucking shelf that he had there and was immediately not in the window. So the whole fucking like dining room heard this muffled screen and looked just and then looked my way. And by the time they look, I was just standing there and I tried to keep a straight face. I fucking, I mean I didn't really burn it bad. He just made this face before he yelled. It was like his brain was registering what the fuck was happening and with his fucking hair pushed up in his hat and that stupid mustache that really wasn't a mustache dude.

Speaker 3:          00:43:47       I fucking ducked down and for like seven straight minutes was like crying, laughing. I was laughing so hard. I remember he wasn't even mad at me cause he was trying to be mad, but I was laughing so hard. He started laughing and uh, you know, then I had to run out and go bus. All that stuff's there. Hey, how about a pat on the back for myself? Rex, you remembering to finish that story? Cause I know that, uh, that I didn't. Oh and by the way, I got a lot of backlash from my given Australia Shit for saying that. You know, you only had one one attack and we had three people like, oh, why don't you look at the population and there's only like 23 million people or some shit and fucking Australia, there's like 400 million here. Well, I will counter that point with the fact that the top 10 fucking most poisonous snakes, like nine of them all reside in fucking Australia.

Speaker 3:          00:44:39       You know, like rock stars living in Jamaica to avoid the fucking taxes in England, right? They're all fucking in Australia. All we got is a couple of rattlers over here. Okay. We're so dedicated to getting killed by snakes. We fucking, we had a guy die with by a Cobra last year. They don't even live here. The thing was just visiting bit them in a car. Um, they think it was suicide. Anyways, that's the a podcast, 45 fucking minutes. It's not bad for just checking in on you. It starts to everybody. All you've got is one more day to go and then it's fucking, it's shit time at the fuck party, right? Isn't that what Joi de Rosa says? All right, I'll talk to you later. See on Monday

And uh, the last thing I wanted to hear, the last thing I want to do, we started talking to him cause he already annoyed the shit out of me. And I know from experience that if I'm going to talk to somebody from another country, at some point they're going to shit on the United States as something that they like to do while calling us the ignorant Americans traveling around the world. You know, all knees and elbows, those motherfuckers come over here and it's just, you can't talk to them for more than fucking five minutes before they, they, they shit on America. I don't want to fucking understand it.

Speaker 9:          00:50:02       Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:50:03       [inaudible] you know, I would never do that. The only, the only way I would do that is if I was on stage in another country. Just just for the fucking ridiculousness of it to start making fun of their fucking country. But if I was sitting on a plane, I would just be telling her, you have a beautiful country, blah, blah, blah. I be a decent fucking guy. I don't fucking, AH, Jesus Christ the was I just going to tigers? You remembered something in the middle of that, the hell was it talking about, hang on a second. Let me think about this.

Speaker 8:          00:50:36       Oh yeah, I remember what it was. Did I tell this story like fucking four months ago, I pulled my big ass truck into this small spot, but there was nobody on the other side of me and I was fine. Right when I came out, somebody had pulled in and it was really tight as far as like on either side of my truck. And then I didn't have a lot of space to back out. So it was this fucking problem. I keep trying to back, you know, back out, come back in, back out, like inching my way in. So this fucking guy starts helping me out. I think he was from England and he's like, uh, you know, next time, why didn't you do the UNAMERICAN thing and back in and I, I, I fucking, I, it's like you can't even help me out of this spot without fucking nitpicking you fucking cunt. You know what? I'll listen to it from Australia. But England though, the amount of shit that is going on in the world still because of those cons, the fact that they actually fucking give you have the balls to give the United States shit the very least be like, hey, welcome to the party.

Speaker 9:          00:51:35       Yeah,

If I actually read, I could fucking bury you guys in this argument. All right. With your jolly rancher flag, whatever the fuck you call it. Um, all right. Thank God I don't have a gig coming up in England after that little thing, you know.

Speaker 7:          00:52:48       [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          00:52:51       a dilemma. A bill, what would you choose? Um, to either have sex with any woman in the world? Nia wouldn't mind. I wouldn't care if she gave a shit if I, my choice of any fucking woman in the world just to do it one time. Yeah. Uh, that wouldn't be worth it. It wouldn't be worth it to lose Nia, but eh, but my Dick would override that wisdom in the moment. Um, or to have access to the truth about any government secret in history. What would you do?

Speaker 9:          00:53:24       Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:53:25       All right. Well, how would I know any government's secret in history? What would they know that I knew it and then they'd start tracking me down and then I'd have to be like fucking Jason Borne for the rest of my life. Never getting to sleep more than five seconds between concussions. Um, all right. First of all, if I could have sex with any woman in the world, who would it be?

Speaker 10:         00:53:46       Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:53:48       Ah, let's see here. Well, you got UK, you got, you got your major groups. I think you've got four major groups. You have famous, you have celebrity women. Um, you have a young celebrities like movie stars. Then you have, you have a rock star, chicks, sports checks, and then you got chicks from your past. You know, some teacher you always wanted to bang any woman in the world, you're going to go back. But she has to be as hot as she was. Oh, this is a dilemma. Oh, by the way, the other day I was at a comedy club in that, that, uh, pink was down, was actually in the crowd. And uh, I didn't go up around anybody. She walked by fucking absolutely like slump against the wall. Beautiful. Absolutely fucking gorgeous. Um, I'm telling you some of the, like those fucking like super famous people, like they don't even look real when they walk by you.

Speaker 8:          00:54:59       They just liked it. That genetics, like, I don't know what happened, but I'm just like, Jesus fucking Christ. You know? I mean, I knew she was good looking right. I've seen the videos, but everybody looks good in videos, you know, and then half the time you see him in fucking real life. I'll tell you this right now. If you ever see pink, she does not disappoint. Fucking just write down the checklist. Absolutely fucking gorgeous. You know, beautiful fucking dress. That was sexy but not slutty. She had the fucking tattoos, but not too many of them. Fucking, just absolutely a fucking gorgeous. I felt like I was in second grade. Um, you know, like when a beautiful girl walks by you like a big [inaudible], you don't even know what to say. Um, all right, so let's get back to it. So if I could beg any woman in the fucking world, well, there's two kinds of women. There's the woman that you, you're fucking is absolutely gorgeous and makes you believe in an afterlife. And then there's the other girl you want to bang just to shutter the fuck.

Speaker 4:          00:56:05       Gotcha.

Speaker 8:          00:56:09       You know what I mean? Like, I bet there's a lot of liberals out there that want to just bang and culture, just stick their dick right in her fucking mouth. You know what I mean? But not like a totally malicious way. Just really put one on her where she's just fucking losing it and you know, making noises in bed that she didn't even know she could make and uh, you know, and make her be able to make those noises even though she knows that you voted for Obama. You know, there's that kind of fucking right.

Speaker 8:          00:56:41       And then there's the other one where you just wanna fuck in a, you know, run down the beach, hand in hand with something girl, at least in my world, that's the only, those are the only two. What would I do? You know what? I would choose a, I would choose sex with any woman in the world because I'm that government learning a government secret. I've actually done that on a certain level and it just, it's like being in show business is when you're like, wouldn't it be cool to meet this person? And then you meet them and they're like the biggest fucking asshole ever. Or they, uh, I don't know. They just like, they just do something that

Speaker 8:          00:57:27       just, it just blows your whole fucking image. It's, it's, it's the wizard of Oz thing. We, you, you don't want it. You don't want to peek around the corner. You don't want it. You don't want to peek around the corners. So what I would do is, uh, I would definitely, I would, I would, I would, I would have sex with some [inaudible] and you know what? I'm [inaudible] it would have to be somebody famous. And, uh, Dan, out of respect for Nia, I would have to be a, just to shut them the fuck up kind of woman. Although I would love to run down the beach. You know, why can't I have that? Why can't I have happiness? All right, let's, let's pick one. One of each. Alright.

Speaker 9:          00:58:12       Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:58:13       Is there any girl I just want to lose, shut the fuck up. I would say back in the day it would've been Madonna, but like, she would just, she was like beyond the noise. She was so fucking annoying. She was like, I would just want to get out of the room.

Speaker 9:          00:58:30       Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:58:31       You know what I mean? They always watches that blonde ambition tour and there's nothing more nauseated than watching somebody who's surrounded by yes men. You know what I mean? That just completely fucking up noxious everything they say. Everyone's hanging all over every word and they just laughing at everything. Like that's, you know something. That's one thing that I have learned in this business is, uh, a major red flag is somebody who has an entourage. If you have an entourage, like a, I dunno, I've already, I, I automatically judge you as like, all right, this person is a, is not somebody I'm going to want to fucking be around. Cause the only way I'm going to be able to exist is this. I assimilate into your entourage and when you tell the joke that isn't funny, I can't be like, I can't look at you like that joke sucks.

Speaker 8:          00:59:16       I have to fucking do like what they are doing, you know, laugh my ass off cause paying for my hotel room the fuck out of here. Right. That and, and people who don't hang out with peers, you know, maybe they don't have an entourage, but everybody they hang out with is fucking like 10 years behind them in this business. Then that's another, that's another red flag because then nobody's calling you out on your shit. Right. That's, that's how I look at it. How did I get to that with this shit? You know what, I'm going to have to get back to you on this one. You know, I'm a fucking 44 year old guy, so I don't really set, you know, when I was younger I had my, my, I'll go back in the day, my list. Okay. When I was a kid, uh, the bionic woman, all three Charlie's angels, um, Farah, I wanted to bang, I had lust for her.

Speaker 8:          01:00:08       Kay Jackson. I would marry and Jaclyn Smith get out, which your fault for stand in between the two of them you're going down to. But you know, I didn't need Jacqueline Smith cause I already had the Brunette with, with fucking, uh, Kate Jackson. Um, then who else? Who else in the 80s? I like what's her face? The replacement for Shelley long. Uh, who's in the look who's talking? She came on at that horse smokey foresee fucking smokey voice, whatever the fuck you supposed to say. It's supposed to sound way more sexier than that. Uh, she had nice fucking curves. Got a little out of control there after a while, but uh, you know, um, she still has nice apps. I got to tell you, uh,

Speaker 4:          01:01:01       who else?

Speaker 8:          01:01:03       You know, it's weird. Florence Henderson, when she had the worst mullet haircut, always turned me on more than when she had that awful fucking, oh, Marsha, Marsha Brady, when she fucking had the little short skirts on fucking a Janet Jackson when she was on a different strokes.

Speaker 4:          01:01:25       Who else?

Speaker 8:          01:01:28       I just, it goes on for fucking ever. I just can't remember anymore. He's never Cyndi Lauper, I could tell you that.

Speaker 7:          01:01:40       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:01:41       She just seemed like some spares. Little fucking boy to me. Yeah. Then that fucking haircut that she had was, she fucking had like a tic Tac toe board on the side of her head. That just really freaked me out.

Speaker 4:          01:01:55       Um,

Speaker 8:          01:01:56       not that I was totally against that here cook cause I thought that chicken bow wow. I thought she was hot.

Speaker 4:          01:02:02       Um,

Speaker 7:          01:02:05       okay.

Speaker 8:          01:02:06       Who the fuck else did I like lead a Ford. Oh my God. That I like her. I think I might've somebody back then. I can't fucking remember. [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          01:03:10       I'm lonely. I was just watching television by myself speaking to it as if it was another life human being. And I saw this commercial for this, this, this new website called farmers only. Dot Com. This is not a commercial people. This is actually an observation. Um, it was basically showing a, you know, some, a couple of ranchers, a couple of farm girls and they just walk in the fields by themselves, you know, playing with their face finger, playing with each other. You know, you do that when you were a little kid. You'd do that little thing where you put your thumb and index finger together and both hands you need kind of do the little, almost like there's an invisible tiny screw. You know there's some poor woman walking through like these a bunch of corn, you know when the cows are all concerned to the point directionally speaking English to one one another, you know about each of them going, how the hell are they going to meet each other?

Speaker 8:          01:04:03       And then all of a sudden this Whalen whore comes over the top and just start singing young. Never be lonely. Add Pharma Zone, lit.com so it's basically their Facebook and you should go and look at it on Youtube. That's what you should do. You shouldn't work, you know, where do you work? What are you doing? Is it your dream or somebody else's? You just a cog in the wheel. You know, are they really going to notice if you stop working, everybody else is working. Why don't you just fucking, you know, Tour de France just sort of draft behind a couple of people's today. You know, take a fucking Monday off, 20 weeks, check out this video. And you know, it's the funniest thing about it is the comments underneath it is the amount of people who shit on, you know, just immediately thinking how dumb people are. It's like these people grow our fucking food. Do you understand that? I'm sure they don't know where the rave is. You know well, who the most popular bands are or how to get from fucking Brooklyn over to Staten Island. Oh right. They don't know how to do that shit.

Speaker 8:          01:05:10       They don't know how to put on a fucking shiny shirt. Right. And go jump on the subway and go down to Wall Street and make sure old people eat dog for the rest of their fucking lives. Yet they don't know how to do that. But you know, they know how to do, they ought to make them, I make corn right, or planets or grows. They don't make it. God makes it, and he makes that fertile fucking country. You know? It's got to be really hard to catch herpes out there. You know what I mean? I mean in much spread. Really fucking slowly.

Speaker 8:          01:05:41       Jesus Christ. I mean, you wonder why you must fucking rub them at least two loads out. By the time you get to her house to sit in there driving and driving fucking tornado, man, pull over. Rub another one out by then you add or you know what the fuck I'm going over there. Foreign ways. Shit. I got more teeth in her. That's a deal breaker. Look, now I'll make fun of him at farmer's only.com. That's going to be embarrassing. You and your fucking neighbor are going to join. You can be the only ones on the site. Hey, I thought you wanted to fuck me. I just was too long of a walk. You know what I'm saying? Plus it's tornado season. You never know what's going to happen. I lived there called the fly overstates and no reason to go there. Yeah, no reason to check in on the food supply.

Speaker 8:          01:06:29       Uh, like you're gonna. That'd be a good thing to fucking freak them out with. Just show up with like a clipboard. The fuck are you doing sit up boy. Or they actually, you know, something, they make themselves kind of separatists. Cause at the end of, is that even a word? Um, they actually say the city folks don't understand. What don't we understand? Loneliness. Is that what it is? Come to New York and be alone with everybody. You never heard that. You fucking, you know what? Fuck them. Goddamn farmers. Jesus Christ. What? You don't have your cousin's phone number. He said, well, you're sick of fucking your sisters and now you gotta get your own Facebook and see the jokes that just too easy here, people, you know.

Speaker 7:          01:07:13       That's good. [inaudible].
