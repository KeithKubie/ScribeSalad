The answer is that the parameter This provides us the functionality we need to

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.380
achieve that.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.030
The parameter This is going to treat the object found on the left of

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.830
the dot at call time as a function input.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.860
And therefore, it will provide us a name that we can use to refer to

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.500
that object.
