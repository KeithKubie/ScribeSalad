Speaker 1:          00:00          Alright. Alright. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab podcast. And before we get rolling on this podcast, just a two items of business we want to put in front of you. First, we're going to be very, I don't know when you're listening to this, but if you're listening to this before June 19th, 2013 that would be a Wednesday next Wednesday. Then you will find us if you're a reddit person. Uh, we're doing an ask me anything for the Reddit folks on that date, 3:00 PM Eastern. So if you want to join us there. Yeah. And as a, as the name suggests, you can ask us whatever you want and we'll do our best to answer details are on our website, radiolab.org okay. Bit of business number two which we're really excited about is we're very close to announcing our next live tour, which is going to happen later in the fall. We're going to go to 20 cities.

Speaker 1:          00:48          It's gonna be awesome to check radiolab.org for that too. And now to the podcast at hand, we are going to be considering two very different takes on everything. Yes. Later we'll get to physicist Brian Green, but we're going to start with a, a woman whose name is not Brian. Ah, hello. Hello. Hello. Hi. Hi. Is this Jenny buying a chance? It sure is. Hey, my name is Jenny Hollowell. She's a writer and author. And here's the setup. Um, so we were really recently asked by the show selected shorts to curate an evening of stories just to select a couple for people to read. Well, that turned out to be really hard for us. Like we, we could not agree, we argue to get kind of ugly internally. I'm not going to go there. But, uh, the one story that we all agreed on instantly and we never really looked back yet was the story, uh, from Jenny Hollowell called a history of everything, including you.

Speaker 1:          01:42          So we called her up and we asked her to a black kind of gushed a little first. Oh yeah. Well there was defining there was the falling when I know that people are gonna hear this so they're not going to read it. So they won't be able to dwell on just the incredible tensions in these very short and specific sentences that you've written. But I'm just wondering how long did this, it's about a five pages to hold in your hand. How many decades did it take for you to write this? Well, it's, it's one of those stories that defies, uh, most of my experiences with writing stories, which is that a kid came up very quickly. Um, uh, and I, I always hate hearing other writers say how quickly something came about because it's a rare occurrence in, you're always kind of full of, of envy for those moments. This is the, you know, one story that I think I've ever written in a day. Wow. But then, you know, just not definitely take time. Okay. Would you mind reading it for us? Uh, and we will, we can talk more on the backend. Okay, sure.

Speaker 1:          02:53          A history of everything including you.

Speaker 2:          02:57          Ooh, first

Speaker 3:          03:00          there was God or gods or nothing.

Speaker 2:          03:07          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          03:08          then synthesis space, the expanse, explosions, implosions, particles, objects, combustion and fusion.

Speaker 2:          03:17          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          03:18          out of the chaos came order. Stars were born and shown and died. Planets rolled across their galaxies on invisible ellipses and the elements combined and became,

Speaker 2:          03:32          um,

Speaker 3:          03:32          life evolved or was created. Sales trembled and divided and gasped and found dry land. Soon they grew legs and fins and hands and antenna and mouths and ears and wings and eyes, eyes that opened wide to take all of it in the creeping, growing, soaring, swimming, crawling, stampeding, universe. Eyes opened and closed and opened again. We called it blinking above us, shown a star that we called the sun.

Speaker 2:          04:04          Oh,

Speaker 3:          04:06          and we call it the ground, the earth.

Speaker 3:          04:11          So we named everything, including ourselves. We were man and woman. And when we got lonely, we figured out a way to make more of us. We called it sex and most people enjoyed it. We fell in love. We talked about God and Bang Stones Together, made sparks and called them fire. We got warmer and the food got better. We got married, we had some children. They cried and crawled and grew. One, dissected flowers, sometimes eating the pedals. Another like to chase squirrels. We fought wars over money and honor and women. We starved ourselves. We hired prostitutes, we purified our water, we compromised, decorated and became esoteric. One of us stopped breathing and turned blue than others. First we covered them with leaves and then we buried them in the ground. We remembered them, we forgot them. We aged

Speaker 3:          05:15          our buildings, kept getting taller. We hired lawyers and formed counsels and left paper trials. We negotiated. We admitted we got sick and searched for cures. We invented lipstick vaccines, PyLadies solar panels, interventions, table manners, firearms window treatments, therapy, birth control, tailgating, status symbols, palimony, sportsmanship, focus groups, Zoloft, sunscreen, landscaping, Sesnas, fortune, cookies, chemotherapy, convenience foods and computers. We angered militants and our mothers. You were born, you learned to walk and went to school and played sports and lost your virginity and got into a decent college and majored in psychology and went to rock shows and became political and got drunk and changed your major to marketing and wore turtleneck sweaters and read novels and volunteered and went to movies and developed a taste for blue cheese dressing. I met you through friends and didn't like you. At first the feeling was mutual, but we got used to each other.

Speaker 3:          06:26          We had sex for the first time behind an art gallery standing up and slightly drunk. You held my face in your hands and said that I was beautiful and you were too tall with the streetlight behind you. We went back to your place and listen to the white album we ordered in. We fought and made up and got good jobs. They got married and bought an apartment and worked out and ate more and talk less. I got depressed. You ignored me. I was sick of you. You drank too much and got careless with money. I slept with my boss. We went into counseling and got a dog. I bought a book of sex positions and we tried the least degrading one. The wheelbarrow. You took flight lessons and subscribed to rolling stone. I learned Spanish and started gardening.

Speaker 2:          07:22          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          07:24          we had some children who more or less disappointed us, but it might have been our fault. You were too indulgent and I was too critical. We loved them. Anyway, one of them died before we did stabbed on the subway. We grieved. We moved. We adopted a cat.

Speaker 2:          07:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          07:44          the world seemed uncertain. We live beyond our means. I got judgmental and belligerent. You got confused and easily tired. You ignored me. I was sick of you. We forgave.

Speaker 2:          07:57          Mm.

Speaker 3:          07:58          We remembered. We make cocktails. We got tender. There was that time on the porch when you said, can you believe it?

Speaker 2:          08:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          08:09          this was near the end and your hands were trembling. I think you were talking about everything including us. Did you want me to say it so it would not be lost? It was too much for me to think about. I could not go back to the beginning. I said, not really, and we watched the sun go down. A dog kept barking in the distance and you were tired, but you smiled and you said here that it's rough, rough, and we laughed. You were like that. Now your question is my project and our house is full of clues. I'm reading old letters and turning over rocks. I bury my face in your sweaters, I study a photograph taken at the beach, the sun in our eyes and the water behind us.

Speaker 4:          09:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          09:07          it's a victory to remember the forgotten picnic basket and your striped beach blanket. It's a victory to remember how the jellyfish stung you and you ran screaming from the water. It's a victory to remember dressing the wound with meat. Tenderizer in you saying, I made it better.

Speaker 1:          09:25          I will tell you this. Standing on our hill this morning, I looked at the land we chose for ourselves. I saw a few green patches and our sweet little shed.

Speaker 5:          09:38          That same dog was barking. A storm was moving in. I did not think of heaven, but I saw that the clouds were beautiful and I watched them cover the sun.

Speaker 4:          09:57          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          09:58          a history of everything, including you or Jenny. Hello?

Speaker 4:          10:03          No,

Speaker 1:          10:04          Jenny, can you talk a little bit about like where, what you were thinking when you're writing this? Like where did this come from? Oh, well, I, the story kind of came from that, that impulse to kind of trace trace back. I think maybe I was in therapy at the time. And you know, they always ask you about your parents or their parents and, and I found myself a little frustrated by the idea that it's, it's traceable, like whatever sort of position you find yourself in life, that, that you can trace back to the origin. You know, if you follow that logic, then you're eventually gonna end up in a, you know, a protoplasm sort of situation. And I think that's why the guys who had, so tell me about your parents. Tell me about their parents. Tell me about their parents. Tell you about their parents.

Speaker 1:          10:51          Just one of those kinds of things. I know, I mean, I wait, where does it end? At some point you're talking about, uh, some caveman's emotionally unavailable parents, and to imagine one of the conversations you might've had with your therapist, I know you were once very religious and then you've kind of lost your faith. I mean, was that part of this, does that happen near or in the neighborhood of writing the story? It was probably about two years before the writing of the story, but it was very, it was still very fresh experience. I was sort of in the thick of it at the time. And was there something of that struggle or fall from faith that kind of got infused into the, to the storytelling? I think so too. I mean, I think that definitely is a part of, you know, the searching that I was going through at the time. Just that desire to grasp what might be the grand, you know, a heart of it all. So the story was a little about that wrestling experience, trying to explain how I'm here, how we got here, how we ended up in this moment.

Speaker 6:          11:57          And the logic of that is having lost a narrative and a given to you narrative of how things began, you were thinking, okay, so let me see if I can work my own narrative from the ground up.

Speaker 1:          12:09          That's, that's definitely, uh, where I was just sort of maybe mourning the loss of that narrative a little bit and, and making one of my own too, to just, uh, give me something to, to think about. Um, I, I definitely don't feel like I stumbled across any solutions, but I felt like the, the comfort of narrative is definitely something I believe in. And, and the story sort of is a extension of, of my process about thinking about the beginning of everything.

Speaker 6:          12:41          Well, that's creation stories go. It's really, really nice. I have to say, you were gonna, you know, you're going to be hearing from Tom Mutek rabbis and Quranic scholars, Christian saints. Have you ever thought about getting a church church start winning your, oh wow. That's a, it feels like a, a can of worms babysit. But thank you.

Speaker 2:          13:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          13:09          that, that concludes the fonting portion of the, uh, of the podcast. We're going to come up and we now have the, the bickering portion coming up in just a moment. Brian Greene, professor of mathematics and Physics at Columbia University. Baker. Baker. Baker. Yeah. Well, we'll continue in a second.

Speaker 2:          13:28          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          14:30          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          14:33          we're back. Uh, we just heard a story by Jenny Hollowell called a, a brief history of everything, including you. Five pages, kind of encompassing the entire universe, everything. Can we do this in a completely different way? Yeah, part two. Okay, so this is about what do for a living. You know that I have this neighbor and friend, Brian Greene, Brian Green, professor of physics and mathematics. Columbia University. Yes, I do know that. And the thing about Brian is he is a theoretical physicist. Now, theoretical physicists say that it's theoretically possible to know everything there is to know in the universe. So one day they'll be able to explain not only how you could send a rocket to the moon, but the laws that govern space and energy and time and gravity, every thing, the whole universe one day they think might be totally understandable using logic and mathematical equations.

Speaker 6:          15:27          Now you can't take that too far. And none of us really imagined that if you asked the equations, what are we going to have for dinner tomorrow night, the equations will spit out fried Tofu and you know, spring rolls or something like that. But at the level of the fundamental ingredients, the particles that make up the universe, their properties, the hope and the goal is that the theories that we work out will apply everywhere and tell us about everything you just said. Everything yes. As in everything. Yes. That's the big, big goal. This is like playing poker. You're helping me. I don't know what you're gonna do. All right. We'll take it to the next step. Okay. Wait, so what do you, what are you up to here? Krulwich well, we, you know, we argue, oh, that's the fun thing we do, but sure. But unlike him, my position has always been that it's going to be very hard to answer all the puzzles in the universe.

Speaker 6:          16:28          And frankly, it's not a bad thing if some mysteries remain mysterious. Yeah, that's my view. But because is so smart when I tell them, how do you know whenever he, he always wins the arguments, but a few months ago, this is, this is the thing that got this whole thing started. I was reading Harper's magazine and I found an article written by another physicist and a novelist, Alan Lightman. I thought, oh boy, this is going to drive Brian Bats because everyone says theirs is a group of physicists and Brian happens to be one of them who've embraced a very exciting idea with an unfortunate effect. If this idea, it turns out to be true, Allen writes, it will then be impossible for physicist to know everything, which I thought, ah, excellent. What is the art? What is the idea it has to do with with more than one universe, you know there is a very weak, you know this, we talked about it before, that there is a a a vogue now for the idea that instead of one universe encompassing everything, there might be more than one, right?

Speaker 6:          17:26          So there actually are a number of ways that physics comes upon this idea of other universes. Maybe the most intuitive is to think about the big bang, that sense space rushing outward and matter could cool on yield to stars and galaxies. That wonderful picture that we've had with us since the 1920s we have in the interim interim decades come to the possibility that the big bang may not be a onetime event. That is there. It may have been many big bangs and may continue to be big bang, like events, each spawning its own universe. If that were the case, then our universe would then be viewed as one of many in this grand collection emerging from all of these big bang like events. Now in this few of things, there could be not just one universe or three or 19 there could be 10,000 it could be, it could be trillions.

Speaker 6:          18:20          That could be an infinite number. And here's the crucial thing. Each and every one of these universes can be different from its neighbor. Vastly different. That's right. So when we studied the equations for the production of these universes, we see in the mathematics that the other universes could have different features, different particle compositions, different masses of the particles, different forces. Some of them might have Adam, some of them might not have that up. You could have universities, lots of stars, some with no stars, some could be made of Munster cheese. I don't know. The fundamental properties of each universe could be very different. That's exactly right. And that's the key to Ellen Lachman's argument. Well, then going back to the beginning of our conversation, if a physicist job is to explore everything that is the universe now the universe has just been demoted to a sub universe.

Speaker 6:          19:12          Then when you get your diploma from a great university, the president of the university is my friends. We are gathered here to meet the people who have earned the credentials to describe the sub universe a little bit of what we could know. It's like you've been demoted. You thought that you were going to get to learn about everything, your word, and now I didn't have that. Your everything is very, it's sub. Oh, I wouldn't describe it like that at all. As you might imagine, rather than do you this as an incredible loss of understanding. The right way of viewing it, I think is to recognize that certain questions that we were asking when we thought there was just one universe where the wrong questions, meaning meaning what well piece has. Here's the way to think about it. This is how it always go. As we've seen this before in the history of science

Speaker 9:          20:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          20:12          take Kepler Yohanas Kepler was an astronomer and a kind of mapper of the solar system. He was trying to figure out where the planets were and the nature of their orbits and stuff and Kepler spent a long time trying to find an explanation for why the earth is 93 million miles away from the sun. 93 million kept with of the has to be a really important number, a key to a deeper mystery, but we now know that he was barking up the wrong tree. Why there isn't just one planet. There are many planets. In fact, many planets around many stars and the distances of those planets from their hosts are varies over a wide range of possibilities. Mars, for example, is 141 million miles from the sun, Jupiter, 483 million and when you start comparing the different distances of planets from the sun, you realize that the fact that the earth is 93 million miles away, it doesn't seem like a deep law of the universe anymore. It just feels kind of arbitrary.

Speaker 6:          21:18          And then that forces you to change the question. Not why 93 million. No, why all these different planets at different distances from the sun. And yet they all stick around the sun. They're all trapped in the neighborhood. That question puts you on the road to a deeper thought. The theory of gravity. The point is says Brian, if you're focused on one thing, you're going to think that one thing is the key to everything. When you're one turns to many, then you think, ah, well the one thing that really wasn't so special buck, the way Brian sees it, that is progress. That is understanding. And then it frees you up to ask other kinds of questions such as what's the law of gravity? What is the equation that allows us to understand how the sun form. So those are real questions and when you can toss out the ones that are red herrings that you thought were deep, but they're actually just asking the wrong question, that frees you up to make progress.

Speaker 6:          22:10          And Brian says you can make the exact same kind of progress if you compare universes. So instead of asking why is our one universe the way it is now you can ask, well, what do all of these universes so different one from the other still have in common. That would be pretty heavy and exciting to describe the underlying laws that govern all universes regardless of their detailed features and what it would be like in that universe or that universe or that universe. Way over there. There are infinite number of them. So if I told you that you could write anything down and it might be a universe, black universe is white, universe is green, universe is soft university, Harvard University, muscular universities, teenie universities, urged universities, then the only one you know intimately is your own. Um, it seems to me that, what do you know about those other units?

Speaker 6:          23:05          Other than that they might be very different and then we don't know very much observationally. Sure. We can't see them. We don't know very much experimentally. So they're definitely on a very different footing from that perspective. But Bryan believes that one day we might be able to experimentally detect these other universes and somehow it'll kind of pick up their distant vibrations. Kind of like the way you hear your neighbors music, it's just emanating through the walls. We might be able to listen in, he says and take a couple of measurements, which would be quite wonderful. And in that case at least there's a chance that we can observational evidence of the existence of these other realms. And at that point I would begin to say, hmm, maybe there's something

Speaker 10:         23:46          really to this. So the physics

Speaker 6:          23:48          doing says I can't go there. I can't observe it. At least for the moment. All I have is my brain and my math and I say from my brain, I'm going to just assume certain things are always true. There's always going to be gravity to say there's always going to be some particle or wave that creates matter. There's always going to be a w, W I don't know. What else are there things that they're always going to be? What are they that are always going [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         24:19          the the things that you were describing need not always really case. Yes. What would be the cases that the fundamental governing equations, the mathematical laws would be the underlying architecture that governs what happens in those places. But environmental details can change things. Absolutely. Really dramatic mental details. That's actually something you know at some level right now, right on the moon, you could jump a lot higher than you can here. So if you didn't get to two, bodies do attract each other. That's right. So there is a fundamental law of gravity that manifests itself in different ways based on the environment. All right, so let me say that again or ask it again. Are there fundamental laws yes. That you think operate in all? Yes. Yes, absolutely. And why do you think that that is a starting point when we come upon this possibility of other universes?

Speaker 10:         25:12          It's not a crazy idea that we dream up late at night when there's nothing else to think about. These are ideas that emerge from the fundamental equations that we use to describe the things that we do see in the world around us, and we follow the equations and the equations suggest to us there might be these other universes, so we have equations, we analyze them and we interpret what they're telling us about reality, but those are the very equations that come to this possibility of other universes. Then those are the equations that govern those other universes. The starting point is let's assume that these are the fundamental awful,

Speaker 6:          25:46          why is God three in one or why did, why does the, was the world made in seven days? I T it aren't we getting close to some sort of a, you're believing in certain things to be always true the way religious people believe. Certain things are always true, not because you've seen it or it just because you can't. You have a faith in it.

Speaker 10:         26:10          I couldn't disagree with you more. I thought, Nah, it has absolutely nothing to do with faith. The reason why we trust the equations is because we've got century's worth of observational and experimental evidence that the equations take us in the right direction here, here, and it's those very same equations that work here that we are following to their logical conclusion to see where the mathematics takes us. Right? So if you remember the the train of reasoning, he may have just projected

Speaker 6:          26:40          here into there. That's faith talking. No, you can't go there. All you can do is say, well, what works with my deep understanding of here has to be there. I don't know why it has to be, but that's what you just said.

Speaker 10:         26:54          No, it's actually the reasoning goes to somewhat reverse order. From that, we build mathematical equations to describe here. We then follow those equations and say, Oh my goodness. Those equations that we developed to describe here are telling us that there is something over there. And then we're like, wow, the equation to a great job of describing things here and the equations have this feature that they tell us. There's another place over there. Maybe that's possible. The key thing on logic

Speaker 6:          27:26          in your mind. Oh, this is, this is not belief [inaudible]. This is just logic. Aren't you worried though that there's another Brian Green in university number three thousand seven hundred and ninety million two hundred and eight 600 and thousand 40 and five who is sitting here talking to another radio reporter in another university? Anything? Well, we know all about the other universities because we're assuming that the math here is the same as the math there in that other place, but as it turns out, they're math and aren't the same, so they will not they that is that. You may just be wrong. Oh, that's always the possible. In fact, it's likely the possibility. In fact, 99.99% of everything we do is wrong. Not from the point of view we make a mistake, but is Reuters is a deep wrong is that you somehow are or somehow feeling that the math is a clue that everything follows your math. If at some point the maths collide and then the universe is collide, then that would be very unsettling to both of you. I would assume in terms of whether the math is him, I'll contradictory [inaudible] your tools of learning are not working.

Speaker 10:         28:33          That would suggest that we were both wrong and that there's a deeper overarching framework. I mean, I, I hate to use the word faith, but the one point where I'll give you faith is this. I do have a deep faith that the universe is coherent and by universe call it multiverse, whatever word you want to use, the whole thing. I do believe that it's coherent. Now, whether that means it follows mathematical laws. I don't know. It could be the case that, you know, when we talked to those aliens that we encounter one day and they say, okay, show us what you got. We bring out our equations and they kind of laugh at us and say, Oh, you guys are still stuck on math, you know? And they said, yeah, you know, 1,010 thousand years ago we were doing math too. But here's the real way of describing it. Now what they be showing us, what the real way of describing it. I have no idea. I can't even imagine what it would be that would be non mathematical. So I do have a deep faith that it's coherent. And the only tool that I know how to encapsulate that coherence are mathematical equations. So if Zan tar, Brian and Brian here come up with equations that Cole allied with another and don't

Speaker 6:          29:42          work, to me it just means that both were wrong and there's some bigger overarching coherence that we've yet to find. That's it.

Speaker 2:          29:56          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          29:56          I don't even, I can't even begin to figure out if you did you just, when did you lose? I can't tell what, wait. So this whole came from Alan lightens article. Right? So do you think he beat the objections in the article? Did he beat the article? Well, I thought it would be fair to ask the author of the article. So I, I called Allen. Yup. What happened is it turns out to be in non Penn, Cambodia.

Speaker 11:         30:18          I, I make all my international calls on

Speaker 6:          30:21          and I, I sent him the interview with Brian. He listened

Speaker 11:         30:24          good. I listened to,

Speaker 6:          30:25          and I asked, well, what do you think about Brian's uh, argument?

Speaker 11:         30:29          Well, I, I don't think that he's wrong, but I think that the problem is philosophically more disturbing than what he is confessing.

Speaker 6:          30:40          He said, well, I think it's going to be much harder than Brian things to actually sense or encounter or measure these other universe if they exist at all.

Speaker 11:         30:49          We don't even know whether the outer universe is exist in the same space and time that we do. And there are other physicists who feel that the universes are even in principle, never, never observable by us, that we will never be able to have any physical evidence of their existence. And that possibility is what I find disturbing.

Speaker 4:          31:19          [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         31:19          it may be that this is the way nature is.

Speaker 6:          31:22          What does that mean?

Speaker 11:         31:22          Well, I mean it may be that, that we've done as much explaining as as possible

Speaker 4:          31:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          31:33          and that we will never ever really understand everything.

Speaker 11:         31:37          Yes. And others we may be, we may have pushed the human mind if as far as it can possibly go.

Speaker 4:          32:01          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          32:01          so, uh, is that everything I think we can say about everything. I think that's everything. All right. Okay. Oh, we should go over. Thank Brian Green professor of physics and math at Columbia University. Alan Lightman up at MIT who's essay, uh, the accidental universe will appear in a book of the same name coming out this fall. So if you want to read the essay, either you buy it in book form soon. Thanks also to Jenny Hollowell of course. Uh, will link you to her short story from our website, radiolab.org and meantime, we'll just say goodbye. Bye Bye.
