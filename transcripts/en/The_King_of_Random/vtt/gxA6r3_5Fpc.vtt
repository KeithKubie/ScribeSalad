Hey whats up guys? I'm out on the Oregon coast this week with my wife, we're camping and we just got our tent set up.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.000
So I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to show you a cool little trick you can do with one of these soda can tabs.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So here's the deal guys, when you're setting the fly up on your tent you may notice these strings with these little black tabs here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.900
And at first they don't seem to serve any purpose.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.000
But if you take one of the loops and loop it down over your tent peg and then pull it tight

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.230
And then pull it tight grab that little black piece and slide it up

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.310
And this acts as a tensioner to put tension on the rope and keep everything taut. That's especially

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.469
Important if you're camping in Oregon where it rains a lot because you do not want your fly to touch the side of your tent

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.649
Or else moisture will get in when everything's pulled away properly like that

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.919
It'll keep the wall of your tent separated and keep all of your belongings dry inside

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.950
But what if your tensioner breaks or gets lost like on this string?

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.209
I don't have one that's not really that big of a deal because we're gonna solve the problem using this soda Tab when you got

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.009
your soda can it's very important to keep this [center] part on the way that you do that is you rotate the tab all the

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.579
Way around until the top part is facing into the hold and just press it down with your thumb

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.079
It should pop out with that center tab intact if it is then your business and the rest is pretty simple

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.718
I've taken the tab and just push it forward a little bit

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.249
So it creates a gap and now if you take the string from the back you can push that through the gap and pull it

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.979
all [the] way through

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.798
now the rest is [just] as simple [as] basically tying a knot to the bottom of this tab and that's just going to be a

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:11.770
Simple Overhand knot

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.259
I'm just going to do one turn and pull that tight and as easy as that

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.920
We've got our homemade tensioner now when we go [up] the line and pull back

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.360
It'll grab on tight, [and] [if] we want to release we just pull this back, and it will slip all the way down

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.780
Let's try it in real life and see how it works. I got the tent peg down here

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.799
So now we just take that loop around our tent peg grab the tab and just pull it straight up

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.930
Just like that our homemade tensioner is working

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.209
And it's working really well if you want a little bit more attention

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.140
just grab the tab and push it up a little bit higher and you can see that when it comes back it digs into the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.960
String and holds its position

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.529
[and] you can apply this trick to almost anything you can think of where you need to apply tension to a line like maybe hoisting

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.110
Some food off the ground to keep it away from Bears or maybe making a clothes hanging line to dry out your clothes [now] obviously

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.250
This isn't a permanent fix

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.009
But it's a great little hack to get you by in a pinch so there you have it guys

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.879
That's a cool little camping hack using materials you probably already have around the campground anyway

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.610
Hope you enjoyed this video, and we'll see you guys in the next one. Talk to you then
