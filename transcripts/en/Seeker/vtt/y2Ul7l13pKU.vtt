00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.530
Halloween is just around the corner and memento
mori’s are everywhere.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.290
Little reminders of death, Skeletons, ghosts,
literally show up at on your doorstep.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:15.790
but if death really did show up at your door,
would know what it smelled like?

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.610
Hey guys Julia here for DNews.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.300
Weird question I know, but we’ve all heard
the horror story of some one’s apartment

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.350
building starts smelling weird.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.840
And for like a week everyone just complains
as the smell gets worse and worse.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.090
Until one day the landlord checks it out and
finds out that the neighbor down the hall

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.899
has been dead for days.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:34.899
ugh creeepy.

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:35.899
But the thing is, as….

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.109
common as the smell is, it’s hard to pin
down.

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:41.819
I mean scientists are very good at figure
out the physics of other senses.

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:42.850
Like light and sound.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.839
But the thing is, scents don’t come in waves.

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.920
It comes in molecules that diffuse through
the air to reach your nose.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.600
How they move is totally random.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.579
The molecules bounce off each other till they
fill a space.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.600
Once they reach your head, those molecules
fit certain receptors and trigger a specific

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.600
smell.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.019
So maybe we have specific receptors to smell
death.

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.010
In the case of death, when something dies,
or meat rots, certain chemicals are produced

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.030
when protein decomposes.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.091
It’s broken down into it’s smaller molecules,
amino acids lysine and ornithine, then, those

00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:14.490
break down further into putrescine and cadaverine.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.039
When those molecules reach our nose, we react
with revolusion.

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:20.990
But we’re not the only ones, surprise surprise.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.780
Lots of animals seem to have an adverse reaction
to a whiff of death.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.090
The zebrafish are a prime example of this.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.370
In one study published in the Proceeds of
the National Academy of Sciences, researchers

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.710
sought to find what goes on in their fishy
brains when they catch a whiff of of death.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.820
They found the fish react very strongly to
low concentrations of cadaverine.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.109
The fish instantly swam away from just a drop
of death.

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:48.680
The researchers found that a certain receptor
in their brains, TAAR13c, fit exactly the

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.930
compound for cadaverine.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.060
It’s kind of like a lock and key system,
the receptor only binds to that compound.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.710
While that particular receptor is only in
bony fishes, we have similar receptors in

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.710
our brains.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.020
And for good reason, Putrescine and cadaverine
warn us when something is wrong.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.340
Whether meat that has gone bad that could
potentially poison us or when something dead

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.479
is nearby signalling danger.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.290
We probably evolved these specific receptors
to help keep us alive.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.940
For some reason, humans smell different when
we decompose.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.570
Those who’ve smelled it say it smells like
nothing else.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.470
Trace unfortunately enough, experienced the
unpleasantness first hand.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.140
He described it as ““sort of like wet
dog but worse, wet dog but warmer and more

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.460
heady, earthy”.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.420
A recent study published in the journal PLOS
one measured the smell of death.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.210
Specifically the smell of human death.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.910
Belgian researchers isolated specific compounds
from decomposing human remains.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.540
They put pig, mouse, mole, rabbit, turtle,
frog, and bird remains in separate jars and

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.510
let them decompose over the course of 6 months.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.750
Not the greatest postdoc job in the world,
but someone’s gotta do it.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.400
The researchers periodically took samples
of the gases and found 452 organic compounds.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.700
Only eight compounds distinguished pig and
human remains from those of other animals.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.840
Which makes sense they’d look for ones exclusive
to pigs and humans since human and pig flesh

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.840
are pretty similar.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.600
But the researchers also found five fragrant
compounds called esters that separated pigs

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.790
from humans.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.270
While these esters could be the key to the
smell of human death, more research is needed.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.150
The study only sampled certain body parts
and didn’t include the microbes that help

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.540
with decomposition that could possibly contribute
to the smell.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.570
Besides just for funsies, the researchers
hoped that nailing down the exact molecules

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.760
behind the smell of human decay they could
“allow a more efficiently training of cadaver

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.880
dogs or portable detection devices could be
developed”.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.340
So that could be cool, it could make it easier
for forensic investigators find evidence or

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.440
maybe it could be kind of creepy.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.750
Most people are morbidly fascinated by the
subject of death.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:55.620
It’s mysterious, terrifying, and yet comes
for us all whether we’re ready or not.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:14.780
Trace recently explored the topic in depth
over on his TestTube Plus Podcast.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.660
Check it out.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.720

death?

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.560
