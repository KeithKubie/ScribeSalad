00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.050
What are some approaches to coping with

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:07.060
inconsistency? Running different controllers for different switches, keeping

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.350
a hot spare replica that has a complete

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.650
view of the network state, keeping the old

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.790
and new state on the routers and switches

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.820
and switching over only when all of the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.760
switches have received the new state Or relying

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.250
on the routers themselves to resolve the conflict.
