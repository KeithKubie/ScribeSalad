00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.325
So congratulations. You've made it to the end of this unit. And we've covered

00:00:03.325 --> 00:00:06.603
quite a bit here. You've learned about breaking programs into modules and how

00:00:06.603 --> 00:00:09.783
this can make it easier to manage complexity, and learning how to manage

00:00:09.783 --> 00:00:13.334
complexity is one of the most important, perhaps the most important, skill that

00:00:13.334 --> 00:00:17.125
you can develop as a programmer. And there are lots of tools for this. One is

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:21.803
modules. The other one that we've learned about in this class is defining your

00:00:21.803 --> 00:00:25.414
own types by using classes. You'll use some of these ideas in the problem set to

00:00:25.414 --> 00:00:28.376
make some improvements to this search engine code. They won't change the

00:00:28.376 --> 00:00:31.704
behavior of the search engine but they'll make it easier to modify and make it

00:00:31.704 --> 00:00:35.184
easier to understand and break into pieces. If you're paying really close

00:00:35.184 --> 00:00:39.210
attention, you might be curious what's going on with these magic init and magic

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.236
str methods before we define them because you'll note when we tried to print out

00:00:43.236 --> 00:00:46.980
a restaraunt object, we didn't get an error. We got something, just not

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.838
something very useful. And we also were able to initialize these objects before

00:00:50.838 --> 00:00:54.274
we defined init. So there was something there already. We didn't get an error

00:00:54.274 --> 00:00:57.240
about an undefined attribute because something was there. What's strange is,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.745
well, we didn't actually create anything explicitly that was there. What we'll

00:01:00.745 --> 00:01:04.730
do next class is explain what was there. And understand how the idea of

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.630
inheritance will allow us to build lots and lots of classes, reusing code from

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.373
previous classes. Hope to see you there for the next unit.
