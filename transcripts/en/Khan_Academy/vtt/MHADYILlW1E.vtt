00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.600
- [Voiceover] In this
video, we're gonna look at

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.530
another familiar pattern of resistors

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.632
called parallel resistors.

00:00:06.632 --> 00:00:10.567
And I've shown here two
resistors that are in parallel.

00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:13.764
This resistor is in
parallel with this resistor.

00:00:13.764 --> 00:00:17.685
And the reason is it shares nodes.

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:19.825
These two resistors share the same nodes.

00:00:19.825 --> 00:00:22.340
And that means they have the same voltage.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.827
And they are called parallel resistors.

00:00:24.827 --> 00:00:26.463
So if you share a node.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.781
Share the same node.

00:00:34.205 --> 00:00:36.424
Then you share the same voltage.

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:48.705
And you are in parallel.

00:00:51.795 --> 00:00:53.230
That's what that word means.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.323
Now, if we go look closer here,

00:00:55.323 --> 00:00:56.951
we'll see some interesting things.

00:00:58.101 --> 00:00:59.973
It's hooked up, we have a battery here,

00:00:59.973 --> 00:01:01.421
some voltage v.

00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:05.247
And because there's a path,
a complete path around here,

00:01:05.247 --> 00:01:06.637
we're gonna have a current.

00:01:06.637 --> 00:01:08.480
We're gonna have a current i

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.168
flowing in this circuit.

00:01:11.158 --> 00:01:12.486
Let's label these resistors.

00:01:12.486 --> 00:01:15.632
Let's call this one R
one and this one R two.

00:01:17.522 --> 00:01:19.406
Those are our parallel resistors.

00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:21.458
When the current reaches this point here,

00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:23.380
when a current reaches this node,

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.423
it's gonna split.

00:01:24.423 --> 00:01:26.245
It's gonna split into
two different currents.

00:01:26.245 --> 00:01:28.291
That current and that current.

00:01:28.291 --> 00:01:32.573
We'll call that one i one,
because it goes through R one.

00:01:32.573 --> 00:01:34.587
And we'll call this one i two.

00:01:34.587 --> 00:01:37.464
And that goes through R two.

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:40.215
Now, we know any current
that goes into a resistor

00:01:40.215 --> 00:01:42.240
comes out the other side.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.605
Otherwise it would collect
inside the resistor,

00:01:44.605 --> 00:01:46.479
and we know that doesn't happen.

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:47.839
This one comes here.

00:01:47.839 --> 00:01:50.231
And they rejoin when
they get to this node,

00:01:50.231 --> 00:01:52.065
and flow back to the battery.

00:01:52.065 --> 00:01:55.099
So the current down here is again i,

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:56.646
the same one as up here.

00:01:58.246 --> 00:02:00.034
Now, what I want to do

00:02:00.034 --> 00:02:02.736
is I want to replace these two resistors

00:02:02.736 --> 00:02:05.931
with an equivalent resistor,
one that does the same thing.

00:02:05.931 --> 00:02:08.812
And by "the same thing," we mean

00:02:08.812 --> 00:02:13.812
causes the same current to
flow in the main branch.

00:02:14.415 --> 00:02:16.015
And so that's what's drawn over here.

00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:17.745
Here's a resistor here.

00:02:17.745 --> 00:02:20.068
We'll call this v again.

00:02:20.068 --> 00:02:23.207
And we'll call this R parallel.

00:02:23.207 --> 00:02:24.808
R P.

00:02:24.808 --> 00:02:29.808
And this resistor causes the
same current i to flow here.

00:02:32.148 --> 00:02:34.360
And now we're gonna work
out an expression for that.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.592
We want to figure out
how do we calculate R P

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:42.809
in terms of the two
parallel resistors here.

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:44.855
Okay, so let's go at it.

00:02:44.855 --> 00:02:45.820
What we know,

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.135
let's see what we know
about this over here.

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:49.637
What we know is the voltages

00:02:49.637 --> 00:02:51.594
on the two resistors are the same.

00:02:51.594 --> 00:02:53.948
We know there's two different currents,

00:02:53.948 --> 00:02:57.367
assuming that these are two
different-valued resistors.

00:02:57.367 --> 00:02:59.763
And now, with just that information,

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:01.178
we can apply Ohm's law.

00:03:01.178 --> 00:03:03.410
And we use our favorite thing, Ohm's law.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.477
Which says that voltage
on a resistor equals

00:03:12.477 --> 00:03:15.318
the current in the resistor
times its resistance.

00:03:16.968 --> 00:03:18.515
So let's write down Ohm's law

00:03:18.515 --> 00:03:20.571
for R one and R two.

00:03:20.571 --> 00:03:24.872
Okay, we know the voltage,
we'll just call the voltage v.

00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:26.284
This is for R one.

00:03:29.706 --> 00:03:31.467
v equals

00:03:33.272 --> 00:03:37.048
i one times R one.

00:03:38.206 --> 00:03:43.154
And for R two, we can
write a similar equation,

00:03:43.154 --> 00:03:45.226
which is v, same v,

00:03:45.226 --> 00:03:48.686
equals i two R two.

00:03:51.076 --> 00:03:53.060
Now there's one more fact that we know,

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.060
and that is that i one
and i two add up to i.

00:04:09.408 --> 00:04:10.500
And these are the three facts

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.562
that we know about this circuit.

00:04:12.562 --> 00:04:14.251
What I'm gonna do now

00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:16.987
is come up with an expression
for i one and i two

00:04:16.987 --> 00:04:19.103
based on these expressions,

00:04:19.103 --> 00:04:20.849
plug them into this equation.

00:04:21.869 --> 00:04:24.485
Okay, I can rewrite this equation

00:04:24.485 --> 00:04:29.485
as i one equals v over R one.

00:04:30.051 --> 00:04:33.169
I can write this one as i two

00:04:34.488 --> 00:04:36.456
equals v over R two.

00:04:38.076 --> 00:04:40.432
And now I'm gonna plug
these two guys into here.

00:04:40.432 --> 00:04:41.974
Let's do that.

00:04:41.974 --> 00:04:46.644
i equals i one,

00:04:46.644 --> 00:04:50.339
which is v over R one

00:04:51.609 --> 00:04:55.953
plus v over R two.

00:04:56.982 --> 00:04:59.165
Let me move the screen up a little bit.

00:05:13.174 --> 00:05:14.440
Okay, now we're gonna continue here.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.387
I just want to rewrite this a little bit.

00:05:16.387 --> 00:05:20.708
i equals v

00:05:20.708 --> 00:05:24.326
times one over R one

00:05:25.596 --> 00:05:29.074
plus one over R two.

00:05:32.904 --> 00:05:35.218
Okay, so here we have an expression.

00:05:35.218 --> 00:05:37.755
It actually sort of looks like Ohm's law.

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:41.044
It has an i term, a v term,

00:05:41.044 --> 00:05:44.917
and this R term here.

00:05:44.917 --> 00:05:46.302
Let me go back up here.

00:05:46.302 --> 00:05:47.704
Here's our original Ohm's law.

00:05:47.704 --> 00:05:48.745
I'm gonna write this,

00:05:48.745 --> 00:05:50.858
I'm gonna solve for i in terms of v,

00:05:50.858 --> 00:05:53.214
just to make it look
a little more obvious.

00:05:53.214 --> 00:05:57.907
I can say i equals v over R.

00:05:57.907 --> 00:05:59.414
And what I hope you see here

00:05:59.414 --> 00:06:01.115
is the similarity between this equation

00:06:01.115 --> 00:06:02.752
and this one down here.

00:06:02.752 --> 00:06:04.828
So I have this R here.

00:06:06.588 --> 00:06:08.559
And what's happening is this term

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:12.905
is playing the role of that, resistance.

00:06:14.055 --> 00:06:16.427
So I'm gonna bring this
equation down here,

00:06:16.427 --> 00:06:18.147
and write it right down here.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.677
Times one over R.

00:06:27.977 --> 00:06:29.674
I'm gonna call this R P.

00:06:30.734 --> 00:06:32.523
Because what I want is

00:06:32.523 --> 00:06:35.660
for this expression and this expression,

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:37.349
I'm gonna set those equal.

00:06:37.349 --> 00:06:39.995
Same i, same v.

00:06:39.995 --> 00:06:41.288
These guys are equal.

00:06:41.288 --> 00:06:43.415
I can write it all, I'll
just write it over here.

00:06:43.415 --> 00:06:47.469
One over R P equals

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.486
one over R one

00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:55.486
plus one over R two.

00:06:55.545 --> 00:06:57.928
This says we have a resistor,

00:06:57.928 --> 00:07:00.426
we're gonna call it R P or R parallel,

00:07:00.426 --> 00:07:04.339
that acts like the parallel
combination of R one and R two.

00:07:07.078 --> 00:07:08.024
So this

00:07:12.006 --> 00:07:14.717
is the expression for a parallel resistor.

00:07:16.407 --> 00:07:18.489
If you want to calculate a replacement

00:07:18.489 --> 00:07:20.700
for R one and R two in parallel,

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.700
you do this computation and you get R P.

00:07:25.853 --> 00:07:27.755
So let's do one of these for real.

00:07:30.763 --> 00:07:32.196
Here's an example.

00:07:37.644 --> 00:07:38.832
Here's an example where I've

00:07:38.832 --> 00:07:40.713
actually filled in some numbers for us.

00:07:40.713 --> 00:07:43.232
So I have a 20-ohm
resistor in parallel with

00:07:43.232 --> 00:07:46.533
a 60-ohm resistor, driven
by a three-volt battery.

00:07:46.533 --> 00:07:48.634
And what I want to do is I want to combine

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:52.375
these two parallel resistors and find out

00:07:52.375 --> 00:07:55.205
what is the current right here.

00:07:55.205 --> 00:07:59.647
Find out what is the current,
that's my unknown thing here.

00:07:59.647 --> 00:08:01.378
I know everything else about this.

00:08:02.718 --> 00:08:03.932
So let's use our equation.

00:08:03.932 --> 00:08:05.485
We said that one over R P

00:08:07.715 --> 00:08:11.090
was equal to one over R one

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.698
plus one over R two.

00:08:15.222 --> 00:08:16.747
And let's just fill in the numbers.

00:08:16.747 --> 00:08:21.314
One over R P equals one over 20

00:08:22.714 --> 00:08:25.003
plus one over 60.

00:08:25.983 --> 00:08:30.983
That equals, let's just make
60 the common denominator.

00:08:31.082 --> 00:08:33.766
So I have to multiply this one by three.

00:08:35.716 --> 00:08:40.422
Three over 60 plus one over 60.

00:08:41.622 --> 00:08:44.367
And that equals four over 60.

00:08:45.637 --> 00:08:48.439
And so now I'm gonna
take the reciprocal here.

00:08:48.439 --> 00:08:51.817
R P equals

00:08:53.129 --> 00:08:54.999
60 over four

00:08:56.429 --> 00:08:58.911
or R P equals

00:09:00.354 --> 00:09:02.734
15 ohms.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.263
So what this is telling us

00:09:06.263 --> 00:09:09.607
is if we have two resistors in parallel,

00:09:09.607 --> 00:09:11.217
20 ohms and 60 ohms,

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:16.217
that is, for the purposes of
calculating the current here,

00:09:16.599 --> 00:09:18.417
that's the same as 15 ohms.

00:09:31.162 --> 00:09:32.583
It took the three volts.

00:09:32.583 --> 00:09:33.837
Just like that.

00:09:39.521 --> 00:09:41.023
Let's check what the current is.

00:09:41.023 --> 00:09:43.120
The current is i

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.080
equals v over R

00:09:49.911 --> 00:09:54.911
equals three volts over 15 ohms.

00:09:56.772 --> 00:09:58.873
That's equal to 0.2 amps.

00:10:00.553 --> 00:10:05.553
Or you can say it's the
same as 200 milliamps.

00:10:10.237 --> 00:10:12.876
So we actually have now
simplified our circuit

00:10:12.876 --> 00:10:14.861
from two resistors to one resistor.

00:10:14.861 --> 00:10:19.538
And we were able to
compute the current here,

00:10:19.538 --> 00:10:24.427
which is 0.2 amps.

00:10:25.506 --> 00:10:26.954
And I would invite you to check this

00:10:26.954 --> 00:10:29.869
by going back and computing
this current up here

00:10:29.869 --> 00:10:31.053
to make sure it's the same.

00:10:31.053 --> 00:10:32.351
And the way you would do that

00:10:32.351 --> 00:10:34.382
is you would calculate the voltage.

00:10:34.382 --> 00:10:36.767
The voltage here is three volts.

00:10:36.767 --> 00:10:39.477
Three volts across 20,
three volts across 60.

00:10:39.477 --> 00:10:41.538
You'll get i one and i two.

00:10:41.538 --> 00:10:43.426
And if you add those together,

00:10:43.426 --> 00:10:45.518
you'll get the total i,

00:10:45.518 --> 00:10:47.621
and it should come out the same as this.

00:10:47.621 --> 00:10:51.068
And I think that's a good
exercise for you to do,

00:10:51.068 --> 00:10:55.158
to prove that the expression
for a parallel resistor,

00:10:55.158 --> 00:10:59.353
one over R parallel can be computed

00:10:59.353 --> 00:11:02.264
from one over R one

00:11:03.125 --> 00:11:06.284
plus one over R two.
