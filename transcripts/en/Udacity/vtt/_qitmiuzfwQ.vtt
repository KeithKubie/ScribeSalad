00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.969
Today I'm speaking with Dr.
Doug Fridsma.

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:07.850
Doug is an internal
medicine physician and

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.170
also has a PhD in
Biomedical Informatics from Stanford.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.840
Starting in 2009, he joined the Office
of the National Coordinator for

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.270
Health IT, was there for
some five years and

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.140
is now the President of the American
Medical Informatics Association.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.760
So, Doug, thank you for
being here with me today.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.260
&gt;&gt; Thank you, I'm delighted to be here.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.830
&gt;&gt; So you were there from
the beginning of high tech,

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.740
effectively through the end,
although ONC is still in operation.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.460
&gt;From my point of view you
guys accomplish a great deal.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.190
More maybe than I would have imagined,
that many people would have imagined.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.190
So can you tell us what you
feel the high points and

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.320
the major accomplishments were?

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.940
&gt;&gt; Well I think if you take a look
at the adoption of electronic health

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.690
records in a country.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.280
When we started in 2009 there was about
a 17% adoption of electronic health

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.230
records.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:07.336
Just last year it's at least larger
medical centers, It's close to 80, 90%.

00:01:07.336 --> 00:01:10.365
And even among the physicians
in the smaller practices,

00:01:10.365 --> 00:01:12.860
it's probably in the range of 60 to 70%.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.810
So in the course of 5 years we took
20% of the largest GDP in the world.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.340
And we convert it essentially
from a paper-based system to

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.590
an electronic system.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.920
And I think It's not the end.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.090
That actually is now the beginning
as we begin to figure out how to

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.830
connect the pieces and how we can refine
and make them better for the doctors and

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:32.590
patients that use them.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.910
&gt;&gt; So, as I speak about things today,
I say that

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.820
the first big challenge was adoption,
and that has been largely overcome, not

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.840
entirely overcome And predictably, the
next big challenge is interoperability.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.630
And as you read about physician
frustrations with EMRs,

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.620
the difficulty of getting these systems
to talk to each other is usually

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.400
high on their list,
if not at the top of their lists.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.240
So, where do you feel we are on that and
what does your crystal ball tell us?

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.940
&gt;&gt; Well, I think interoperability
is probably the next big challenge.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.520
I think there are issues in usability.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.920
I think there are issues in safety and
security.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.640
All of those things,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.090
I think, are going to be important
now that we've got adoption.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.160
But, when it comes to
interoperability,the thing that is so

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.900
critical is to really define
what it is that you want to do.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.190
So when somebody complains that
their systems are not interoperable,

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.410
my first question to them is well
what were you trying to accomplish?

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.270
The definition of interoperability
is about the ability to exchange

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.260
information, and then the ability to use
the information that's been exchanged,

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.680
so you can't separate interoperability
from the thing you want to do.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.380
We think sometimes that interoperability
is this green pasture that we're

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.520
eventually going to get to.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.780
This state of being that
everything is going to work.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.790
But in fact, interoperability
is one of those things that's

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.510
based on the things you want to do.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.950
It's incremental.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.056
It's iterative, and we will never
probably ever get there entirely

00:03:05.056 --> 00:03:08.592
because there will always do a new
thing that we want to do for

00:03:08.592 --> 00:03:10.946
which the capability doesn't exist.

00:03:10.946 --> 00:03:16.324
&gt;&gt; So this course in the informatics
world in general there's a lot

00:03:16.324 --> 00:03:22.770
of excitement about FHIR, as maybe
the solution to interoperabilities.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.100
What are your views on that?

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.970
And do you see FHIR as the sort of
tool that can evolve as people's

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.820
requirements become more
sophisticated over time?

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.390
&gt;&gt; So, the great thing about
FHIR is it solves a problem.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.280
And when you've got a standard, or
if you've got a technology that solves

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.560
a problem people are going to
use it because it helps them.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.140
A lot of times we create
standards in committees and

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.370
have the expectation that if we
build it, people will then use it.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.310
And we've got that wrong.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.220
What we need to do is
find the problems for

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.160
which we can develop standards
that solve those solutions.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.770
HL7, which is sort of the place
that FHIR has developed,

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.420
it had their first set of standards
really to help create interoperability

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.250
within the enterprise, and
many of the vendors adopted it,

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.980
it was wildly successful, it was able to
connect all of the pharmacy systems to

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.654
the laboratory systems and things,
using those kinds of messages.

00:04:19.654 --> 00:04:24.350
FHIR stands to transform the same
thing between enterprises, and

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.660
because it's aimed at
the implementer and

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.720
geared towards the person who's
actually going to have to use it.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.210
It's simple, it's easy to use,

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:34.990
it uses the best technologies
that are out there.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.910
And a standard isn't a standard because
you say it is, it's a standard because

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.700
people use it, and this is a standard
that people actually are using, so

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.350
I think it's going to
have tremendous impact.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.060
So shifting gears a bit,
we've emphasized in this course,

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.040
and are emphasizing, the chronic disease
patient who's got multiple problems and

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.710
multiple doctors.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.470
There's an obvious need for
information sharing there, and

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.990
the role that the patient might and
arguably should play in their own care.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.400
As you look out to the future,

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.700
how do you see the patient fitting into
the whole spectrum of informatics and

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:18.620
where the data is stored and
how the data is accessed?

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:22.010
&gt;&gt; You know,
you can take a look at what's happened

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.330
in other parts of a person's life,
an individual's life, to get a sense for

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.730
what may be happening in healthcare.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.380
So, it used to be that
to get a airline ticket,

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.110
you had to call up a travel
agent who would then

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.200
access this system that you had no
way of knowing what was in there.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.880
Now, all of those things are available
for individuals and they can make

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.100
their own hotel reservations,
and their own plane tickets.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.590
I think the EHRs right now
are kind of in that same rule.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:52.030
You go there, there's information in
there that the doctor tells you about,

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.930
and then you'll use that
information in your healthcare.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:59.010
As we begin to open that up, not only
in the terms of having access for

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.380
the patients, but for the patients
to put their information into it.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.710
You suddenly have one more information,
and you empower the patient to have

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.110
a whole lot more knowledge
about what's going on.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:13.360
So, to me, it's not a matter of if,
it's a matter of when.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.380
Because the things that are happening in
the rest of society are going to begin

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.780
to impact healthcare
in a substantive way.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.830
And as it becomes easier and cheaper for

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.860
patients to have access to their own
information, that's going to happen.

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.060
&gt;&gt; So if adoption was the first big
challenge, and interoperability is

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.150
the second, and the least in my view of
the world, the third is the analytics.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.120
Where do you think we
are in analytics and

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.029
where do you think we're going to
go in the next few years.

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.080
&gt;&gt; I think, again, there's a lot of good
work that's been done in bioinformatics.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.600
I think we're starting
to see it in other

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.520
areas in which people are beginning
to aggregate that data.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:52.000
Part of the challenge that we have in
health care is that not only do we have

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.690
knowledge about healthcare and
medicine and the associations there.

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:59.750
We need to be able to apply
that to the data that we see.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.760
And so, it isn't simple
mathematical relationships.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.950
It isn't necessarily,
simple associations.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.380
But there's sort of a deep
understanding of medicine and

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.960
care delivery,
that's embedded in the data there.

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.030
So, it's an exciting
time because as more and

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.980
more of this data becomes available,
we're going to be able to apply

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:22.790
those informatics techniques to
be able to extract information.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.790
But to do it in a way that is

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.150
understanding of how
the cure is delivered.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.620
And if we can leverage the best that's
happening in the engineering field and

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:32.990
computer science and

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.300
marry that with what we understand
about healthcare delivery.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.710
I think we're going to
make some good progress.

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.000
Are we there yet?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.610
No.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.510
I think there's still a lot
that needs to be done.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.120
We're seeing some areas of excellence,

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.850
sort of centers that are doing some
of that, hospitals like Geisinger and

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:55.930
Kaiser and others that
are doing some analytic work.

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:59.490
But I only see this accelerating
at an incredibly rapid pace.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:04.950
Storage and the movement of the data
is becoming less and less expensive.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:07.799
And as a result I think more and
more analytics will be applied.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:13.610
&gt;&gt; Is the lack of structure
in a great deal of medical

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:17.040
record information a barrier to that?

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.690
Do we need to keep pushing toward
a goal that many of us had years and

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.640
years ago of everything
being structured,

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.700
or Are we okay with where we are at,
in terms of nature of the data?

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:31.160
&gt;&gt; I actually think that you need
structure when you need to make

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:36.500
decisions or help for an individual
patient, or a small group of patients.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:40.909
It's difficult to determine
a drug-drug interaction through our

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.750
data analytics on a single patient.

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.260
So you need to be able to categorize
that stuff so that rules can fire and

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.080
alerts can be sent.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:53.500
But when you start to have
hundreds of millions of patients.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.340
I think the need for

00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:59.420
structure actually goes down,
even technologies like IBM Watson

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.210
unstructures structured data to be
able to do the analytics that they do.

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.060
So, I think we need to be very
comfortable with the ability to have

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:08.310
unstructured data.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:12.580
Part of the challenge that we're going
to have is that if what we do is we

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:17.760
require structure as a barrier
to exchange of information.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.690
We're going to sell ourselves short
in our ability to do analytics.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.901
We need to get all the data out there so
that we could apply those analytics.

00:09:24.901 --> 00:09:29.785
&gt;&gt; If you could rewind the clock and
spend your five years at

00:09:29.785 --> 00:09:34.670
ONC all over again, what are one or
two things you would do differently?

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:39.850
&gt;&gt; You know, it was a remarkable time
to be in the federal government,

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:45.380
with the passage of the HITECH Act, and
just the excitement that was going on.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:49.680
Obviously if all of the standards
had been baled, and had been ready.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.810
That we could have just picked them
off the shelf and put them out there.

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.530
That would have made
our job a lot easier.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.160
What we need is going to be a portfolio.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.140
We have the beginnings of a portfolio.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:05.010
I think we did a grand experiment that
was different than any other country in

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:07.600
terms of how we tried to
approach this problem.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.070
We didn't engineer it from the top down,
we created the building blocks and

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:13.540
allowed the market to
sort of drive that.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:19.260
Now, it's resulted in some innovative
companies sort of getting lost.

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:23.750
I wish there was a way that we could
have created a playing field that

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:27.040
allowed everybody to equally compete.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.480
But sometimes that's hard, and
when you use a market-driven approach,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.320
there are some Winners and
losers in all of that.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.460
The challenge that we
have I think is that,

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.380
as we have all of these
products out there,

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:42.200
we've reached a level of saturation and
adoption in the market place.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.880
We're going to start to
see some consolidation.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.290
What's important is that we
don't lose that innovative and

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.510
entrepreneurial edge as that happens.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:55.860
And I think things like FHIR, that
produce the ability to create apps and

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.420
to create other kinds of
functionality are going to be

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:03.040
really important as we go into that next
level, where we take where we have now,

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.300
and we begin to refine it and
add the analytics that we need.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:12.156
&gt;&gt; The Jason report essentially paints
a picture of EHRs as a database.

00:11:12.156 --> 00:11:16.790
And most of end-user work,
particularly in the physicians and

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:21.170
patients, is done through
apps that access data,from

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:25.490
that database using FHIR,and also,
of course, can add data to it.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.920
Is that the world of
the future that you see?

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.880
&gt;&gt; I think increasingly the electronic
health record is going to be a data

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:33.770
store in the sky.

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:37.080
I think that patients
are going to be the principle

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.620
health information exchange,
in that they'll be the hub for

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.940
all this information that's
going to be exchanged.

00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.640
I hope that at the end, all of this
technology doesn't create additional

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:52.120
barriers for patients, but makes them
first order participants in their care.

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:54.030
I think when that happens,

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:57.230
we are actually going to be able
to have tremendous innovation.

00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:01.630
Perhaps the biggest underutilized
innovative force in medicine

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:02.980
is the patient.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.420
And I think their needs are going to
probably drive more innovation that

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.660
anything we could ever think of and
think about with regard to

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:14.640
physicians and nurses and others who
are using the electronic health worker.

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.340
&gt;&gt; So the exercise that students in
this course are going through, and

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:22.150
it aims to learn FHIR and
develop fire apps

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.390
toward the future world where
that's the primary vehicle for

00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.780
use by physicians and patients
makes sense to you, it sounds like.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:30.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it does.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.390
I think that's a great approach
to kind of set the stage.

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.850
I mean, if you want to know what
the future is, you have to be there and

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:38.360
try to invent it.

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.760
&gt;&gt; Well, great.
Thank you so much.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:41.720
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; For being with me here today.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.220
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
