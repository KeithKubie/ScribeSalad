00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.210
There are several ways to look
at different intrusion detection

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.470
approaches.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.390
&gt;From the point of view of
how data is analyzed, or

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.340
how intrusion is detected,
we have two approaches.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.720
One is misuse detection,
also known as signature-based detection.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.580
The other one is anomaly detection.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.690
Misuse detection models all
represents long intrusions.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.410
Anomaly detection models all
represents normal activities.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.970
&gt;From the point of view
of deployment strategy,

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.680
we can deploy an IDS on end host,
or a network perimeter.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.070
In terms of how the detection
models are viewed and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.210
maintained, we can use manual
encoding of expert knowledge.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.570
All hand written rules, or
we can apply machine running

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.550
algorithms to data to automatically
learn the detection rules.
