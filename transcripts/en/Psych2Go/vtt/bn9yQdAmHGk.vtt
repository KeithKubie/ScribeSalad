00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:13.120
Have you ever wondered why people act the way they do? Do you want to know why we get angry, sad, happy?

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.860
Psychology can offer answers and insights into how we act and why we feel how we do

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.360
Do you want to learn some really exciting and surprising pyschological

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:30.300
findings? If you do, watch on for nine very interesting psychological facts that you may not know about

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.770
Number 1:

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:38.939
People who speak two or more languages may change their personalities between languages without even knowing it

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.819
So someone may become more introverted when speaking French, or more agreeable when speaking German

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.530
Number 2:

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:55.440
People are more likely to follow orders in unfamiliar settings. This is because we're more likely to be obedient when we're unsure

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.259
or when we feel others have more knowledge than us

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.710
So if you want someone to do something with you, like go on a trip, maybe ask them in an unfamiliar environment

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.199
Number 3: Even those who are concerned with equality, holds implicit bias about things such as race

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:21.209
This is due to something known as the out-group bias, where we implicitly trust those who aren't a part of our in-group plus

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.629
It is important to remember that this is implicit?

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.299
Meaning it is not consciously controlled

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.720
Number 4:

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.209
Eye contact makes us more resistant to persuasion

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:41.549
This seems to be because eye contact is related to dominance- something we resent when someone is trying to persuade us to change our minds

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.799
so when you're trying to convince someone to buy something or to go to the cinema with you,

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.470
eye contact might not be good

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.880
Number 5:

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.509
The actor-observer bias is a tendency for us to blame our behavior on situational factors

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.229
But blame other people's behaviors on internal factors

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.688
For example, we may blame our own bad mood on getting stuck in traffic

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.019
Why we would blame others bad mood on the personality

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.589
It's important we don't just make exceptions for ourselves

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.569
So try to be open-minded towards others when working out why they haven't acted a certain way

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.809
Number 6: women who give birth to boys are more likely to develop postnatal depression

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:31.819
Myers and John's finding could be helpful in identifying those at risk of postnatal depression and giving them extra support

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.260
Number 7:

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.190
social media usage increases depression and loneliness

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.799
Huntail found that this was especially true of people who were already depressed

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:50.179
It seems this is a case due to social comparison- comparing your lives to other's lives as seen on social media

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.209
So if you find yourself feeling lonely or depressed

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.169
Spending a bit less time on social media might be a good idea

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.760
Number 8:

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.679
Daughters who have close ties with their fathers can overcome loneliness easier

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.559
This was only true with daughters

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.920
With sons the closest of their relationships with their parents didn't affect how well they overcame loneliness

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:21.480
Yanelle suggested this is because boys aren't socialized to have close bonds and relationships in the same way girls are

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.220
