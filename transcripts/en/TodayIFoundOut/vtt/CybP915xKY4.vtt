00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.920
Kim Jong-Il was born Yuri Irsenovich Kim.
His official biography states that he was

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.070
born on a sacred mountain (Baekdu Mountain,
the legendary birthplace of Korea’s first

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:27.599
kingdom) on February 16, 1942, where his father
was serving in a secret military base, attempting

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.540
to overthrow the Japanese. Further, it states
that his birth was marked by a double rainbow

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.000
over the mountain, a new star appearing in
the sky, and, before his birth, a swallow

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.350
foretold his coming.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.850
Besides the obvious parts of this that aren’t
true, he also was not born on Baekdu Mountain

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:55.149
in 1942, but rather was born in Vyatskoye,
Khabaroskv in 1941. Vyatskoye is a small hamlet

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.879
in Russia. Kim’s father, Kim Il-Sung, was
actually a commander in the Soviet 88th Brigade

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.900
there. After WWII, Korea gained its independence
from Japan and the family returned to Korea

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.979
where his father began being groomed to rule
by the Soviets, first being installed by Stalin

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.500
as the head of the Provisional People’s
Committee. Shortly thereafter, he was made

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.460
Prime Minister and eventually became President.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.960
Other interesting Korean state propaganda
surrounding Kim Jong-Il include:

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.159
He never pooped (perhaps that contributed
to his declining health).

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.070
He wrote over 1,500 books in a three year
time-span.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.030
He wrote six full operas that are considered
by experts to be the best six operas ever

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.570
created.
The first time he played golf in 1994, he

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.520
shot 11 hole-in-ones and was 38 under par
(verified by all of his bodyguards, no less).

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.880
From there, he nearly always shot several
hole-in-ones any time he golfed.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.979
He began walking at just three weeks old and
could fluently speak at just eight weeks old.

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.290
People the world over receive plastic surgery
to try to look more like Kim Jong-Il. His

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.920
hair and clothing styles are also widely mimicked.
His birthday is highly celebrated throughout

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.429
the world.
He had the ability to control the weather

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:16.020
and it usually reflected his moods.
He invented hamburgers as a way to provide

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.700
a new tasty food for his impoverished people.
