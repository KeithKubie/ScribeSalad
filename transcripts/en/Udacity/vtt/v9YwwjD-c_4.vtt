00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And again we compute the difference here which is 46,250 - 40,000 or 6,250, over 40,000

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and of course, we have to multiply by 100 to make it a percent

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and we get an answer of 15.6 or I'll just call it 16% error.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now 16% seems like a lot.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This experiment like every experiment ever done in physics is subject to error.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now the tricky thing is identifying and quantifying the sources of our error.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now in this situation, we're really lucky. We have a known reference number to compare to.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We know the earth had a circumference of 40,000 kilometers so when we make some calculations and

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
get an answer that's different, we can immediately quantify how wrong we were.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But when Eratosthenes was doing this experiment, he didn't now that.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
He had no idea what the actual circumference was and so what have been his benefit

00:01:01.000 --> 99:59:59.000
to keep track of error as he was going along--so let's do that for this experiment.
