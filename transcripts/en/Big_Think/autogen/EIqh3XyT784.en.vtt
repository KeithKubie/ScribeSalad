rolling on sometimes there are benefits

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:16.689
rolling on sometimes there are benefits
 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.830
rolling on sometimes there are benefits
to new technology and sometimes there

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840
to new technology and sometimes there
 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.359
to new technology and sometimes there
are things that aren't don't work out so

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369
are things that aren't don't work out so
 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.240
are things that aren't don't work out so
well so for instance what we try to do

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250
well so for instance what we try to do
 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.340
well so for instance what we try to do
is we always try to take the best of

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350
is we always try to take the best of
 

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.620
is we always try to take the best of
Mother Nature and combine it with the

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630
Mother Nature and combine it with the
 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.900
Mother Nature and combine it with the
best of technology we find that that

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910
best of technology we find that that
 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.630
best of technology we find that that
Union works really really well we try to

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:36.640
Union works really really well we try to
 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.330
Union works really really well we try to
stay away from anything experimental or

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340
stay away from anything experimental or
 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.860
stay away from anything experimental or
unproven and go back to basics

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870
unproven and go back to basics
 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.950
unproven and go back to basics
technology also is unfortunately faddish

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960
technology also is unfortunately faddish
 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.920
technology also is unfortunately faddish
in the same way that sometimes we see

in the same way that sometimes we see
 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.640

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.160
this with food no fat low fat high carb
high protein you know it's what are you

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170
high protein you know it's what are you
 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.229
high protein you know it's what are you
supposed to eat and people tend to jump

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239
supposed to eat and people tend to jump
 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.590

on a bandwagon that is generated by the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600
on a bandwagon that is generated by the
 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.049
on a bandwagon that is generated by the
press so one day and ingredient whether

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059
press so one day and ingredient whether
 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.670
press so one day and ingredient whether
it could be a very efficacious good

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680
it could be a very efficacious good
 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.620
it could be a very efficacious good
ingredient but if it's fallen out of

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630
ingredient but if it's fallen out of
 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.050
ingredient but if it's fallen out of
favor out it goes and then the

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060
favor out it goes and then the
 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.969
favor out it goes and then the
technology has to change to compensate

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979
technology has to change to compensate
 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.030
technology has to change to compensate
for that so but on the other end you

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040
for that so but on the other end you
 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.580
for that so but on the other end you
know technology does bring advances you

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590
know technology does bring advances you
 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.800
know technology does bring advances you
know those advances and anti-aging and

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810
know those advances and anti-aging and
 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.410
know those advances and anti-aging and
sun protection so the things that are

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420
sun protection so the things that are
 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.450
sun protection so the things that are
very legitimate but the knife cuts both

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460
very legitimate but the knife cuts both
 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.580
very legitimate but the knife cuts both
ways yeah I can't think of any real

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590
ways yeah I can't think of any real
 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.260
ways yeah I can't think of any real
specific technologies like dramatically

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270
specific technologies like dramatically
 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.820
specific technologies like dramatically
different technologies that have come in

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830
different technologies that have come in
 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.250
different technologies that have come in
to apply maybe sunscreen since we

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260
to apply maybe sunscreen since we
 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.690
to apply maybe sunscreen since we
started our business yeah we're the

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700
started our business yeah we're the
 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.660
started our business yeah we're the
biggest the biggest one would be

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670
biggest the biggest one would be
 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.399
biggest the biggest one would be
oil-free moisturizer which would

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409
oil-free moisturizer which would
 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.140
oil-free moisturizer which would
probably been in the last 20 years well

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150
probably been in the last 20 years well
 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.670
probably been in the last 20 years well
I think it would be more fats like

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680
I think it would be more fats like
 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.620
I think it would be more fats like
you're saying you know organic had

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630
you're saying you know organic had
 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.630
you're saying you know organic had
become a real big thing over the past

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640
become a real big thing over the past
 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.760
become a real big thing over the past
few years and it's sort of died down a

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770
few years and it's sort of died down a
 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.160
few years and it's sort of died down a
lot lately you know and that was never a

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170
lot lately you know and that was never a
 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.890
lot lately you know and that was never a
bandwagon we jumped on and as Andrew was

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900
bandwagon we jumped on and as Andrew was
 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.530
bandwagon we jumped on and as Andrew was
saying you know we utilize gentle

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540
saying you know we utilize gentle
 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.880
saying you know we utilize gentle
technologies that are tried true and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890
technologies that are tried true and
 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.380
technologies that are tried true and
trusted along with those natural

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390
trusted along with those natural
 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.750
trusted along with those natural
ingredients similarly try to entrusted

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760
ingredients similarly try to entrusted
 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.870
ingredients similarly try to entrusted
in the most gentle efficacious manner so

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880
in the most gentle efficacious manner so
 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.300
in the most gentle efficacious manner so
that you're never finding irritation and

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310
that you're never finding irritation and
 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.289
that you're never finding irritation and
hopefully getting the very best

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299
hopefully getting the very best
 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.479
hopefully getting the very best
performance so we're not necessarily

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489
performance so we're not necessarily
 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.430
performance so we're not necessarily
looking for what the newest technology

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440
looking for what the newest technology
 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.309
looking for what the newest technology
is if we can incorporate something that

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319
is if we can incorporate something that
 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.920
is if we can incorporate something that
is trustful into the brand we don't need

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930
is trustful into the brand we don't need
 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.680
is trustful into the brand we don't need
to reinvent the wheel every sing

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690
to reinvent the wheel every sing
 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.000
to reinvent the wheel every sing
season and then again we're not against

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010
season and then again we're not against
 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.040
season and then again we're not against
organic ingredients and the problem is

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050
organic ingredients and the problem is
 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.010
organic ingredients and the problem is
is that they've been so misrepresented

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020
is that they've been so misrepresented
 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.470
is that they've been so misrepresented
to the customer saying this is organic

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480
to the customer saying this is organic
 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.670
to the customer saying this is organic
but you look then you read the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680
but you look then you read the
 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.960
but you look then you read the
ingredients and it's one ingredient

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970
ingredients and it's one ingredient
 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.330
ingredients and it's one ingredient
which is point zero two percent of the

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340
which is point zero two percent of the
 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.370
which is point zero two percent of the
product and then the customer finally

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380
product and then the customer finally
 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.230
product and then the customer finally
figures this out and is disappointed and

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240
figures this out and is disappointed and
 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.610
figures this out and is disappointed and
then they have to ship this organic

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620
then they have to ship this organic
 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.380
then they have to ship this organic
ingredient halfway from around the world

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390
ingredient halfway from around the world
 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.800
ingredient halfway from around the world
so the carbon footprint that it produces

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810
so the carbon footprint that it produces
 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.530
so the carbon footprint that it produces
is so bad for the planet so and there

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540
is so bad for the planet so and there
 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.120
is so bad for the planet so and there
was a really organic eyes are grown

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130
was a really organic eyes are grown
 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.220
was a really organic eyes are grown
indoors you know was there acid rain

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230
indoors you know was there acid rain
 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.580
indoors you know was there acid rain
right so organic isn't necessarily

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590
right so organic isn't necessarily
 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.260
right so organic isn't necessarily
better always I mean what we try to do

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270
better always I mean what we try to do
 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.030
better always I mean what we try to do
is always horrible I many locally

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040
is always horrible I many locally
 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.270
is always horrible I many locally
continues natural when we can and

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280
continues natural when we can and
 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.040
continues natural when we can and
organic if it's available but we don't

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050
organic if it's available but we don't
 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.750
organic if it's available but we don't
use that as the litmus test because

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760
use that as the litmus test because
 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.010
use that as the litmus test because
there are many more important things

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020
there are many more important things
 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.090
there are many more important things
that go into the full formula
