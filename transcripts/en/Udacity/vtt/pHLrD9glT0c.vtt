00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.780
We covered a lot of ground in this lesson spanning DHTs, CDNs, key

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:11.390
based routing and how to avoid overloading the matter data server

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.360
and the origin server using the concept of sloppy DHT. What Coral

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.730
System does is offer a vehicle to democratize content

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.700
generation, storage, and distribution, through a participatory approach.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.080
I encourage you to read the paper in full, to understand how the system has

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.840
been implemented. Of course, Commerical CDNs such

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.820
as Acmite, do not operate in this way.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.850
They're in it for the money. They

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.330
contractually mirror the content for a customer. And

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.660
they deploy their own additional mirrors to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.030
deal with dynamic increase in volume of requests.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.890
With this discussion, we complete the lesson module on Internet Scale Computing.
