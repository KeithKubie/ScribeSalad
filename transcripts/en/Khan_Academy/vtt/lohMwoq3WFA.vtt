00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.060
They're asking us to
draw a right triangle.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.160
So that means it has to
have a 90-degree angle.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.280
But it's also an
isosceles triangle,

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.010
so that means it has to have
at least two sides equal

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.655
and has two sides of length 3.

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:13.530
So those two sides that
are going to be equal

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.150
are going to be of
length 3, and it's

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.540
got to be a right triangle.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.120
So let's see if we can do that.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.410
So let's try to make this right
over here the right angle.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:27.340
And let's make this side and
this side have length 3, so 3

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.310
and then 3 right over there.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.690
Let me make sure I get
that right angle right.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.510
OK, there you go.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.920
So it's a right angle.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.050
It's isosceles.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.240
At least two sides are equal.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.230
And the two sides have length 3.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.670
So it seems like we've met
all of our constraints.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.710
Now they say, is there
a unique triangle

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.400
that satisfies this condition?

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.280
So another way of
rephrasing that, is this

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.010
the only triangle
that I could have

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.250
drawn that meets
these conditions?

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.750
Well.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.291
I can't change this angle if I
want to meet these conditions.

00:00:56.291 --> 00:00:57.850
I can't change
these two lengths.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.610
And if you keep
this angle constant

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:00.790
and you keep these
two lengths constant,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.690
then this point and this
point are going to be

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.740
there are no matter what.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.500
So this is the only side that
can connect those two points.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.017
So this is the only triangle
that meets those conditions.

00:01:11.017 --> 00:01:12.600
You can't have
different side lengths,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.160
or you couldn't have different
angles right over here

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.364
and also meet those conditions.

00:01:17.364 --> 00:01:18.780
So is there a
unique triangle that

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.370
satisfies the given conditions?

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.490
Yes, there's only
one unique triangle.
