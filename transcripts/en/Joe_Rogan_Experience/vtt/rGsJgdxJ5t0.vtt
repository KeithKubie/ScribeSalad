1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
Ladies and gentlemen.
Bam.
We are live with my pal,

2
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.400
Brian,
Callan,
ladies and gentlemen.
Right.
Carolyn,
good to be here.

3
00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.700
An honor to be here at pleasure and the honor to have you sir and client is uh,

4
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.590
my longest running front and Hollywood.
I think so,
right?
Yeah,
for sure.
Years.

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:19.310
Yeah.
We've been friends a long ass time.
Almost 20 years.
Yeah.

6
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.530
94 or something like that.
People still come to me.
It was 98,

7
00:00:22.531 --> 00:00:27.090
1995 and people still come up to me and asked me if we're half brothers.

8
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.120
You are the ones that abuse to say it on Wikipedia.
That's right.

9
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.820
I MDB one of those.
It's a rumor.
I like keeping it alive.
Keep it alive.
I'm,

10
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.080
I never refuted.
Yeah,
either do I now.

11
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.430
Now I think you were the one who told me about Gracie Jujitsu.
Yeah,

12
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:44.590
I remember that.
I remember we connected immediately.
A totally,

13
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.060
you show up at those guys are all just low blood sugar.
Just a bunch of actors.

14
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:50.580
All of a sudden this guy,
see,
I'm like,
wait a minute.
That guy looks like me,

15
00:00:50.581 --> 00:00:55.500
but he's thicker and you look way more extreme and yet a 10 time horizon you

16
00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:56.730
really can possibly muster.
I was like,

17
00:00:56.731 --> 00:00:59.490
that guy looks like he fights and you're like,
yeah,
I fight.
I like to fight,

18
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:00.091
I need to fight.

19
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:02.400
I didn't think I need to be in class otherwise I'll end up in jail.

20
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.500
And I was like,
that guy's going to be my friend for ever.

21
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.000
We connected so quick right away with everything,
every retarded thing.

22
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:13.320
We'd love pit bulls and,
and we're,
we both know it's retarded.

23
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.430
That's the difference.
All of my extreme macho psycho shit,

24
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.790
I know it's fucked up.
Like I know my tattoos are fucked up.

25
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.570
I know my neck is too big.
I don't give a fuck,
you know?

26
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.990
I know my car is too loud.
I don't care whether you like it.

27
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:31.500
You've always been my canary in the coal mine.
You as well.
You know,

28
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:33.150
as long as I know you're still out there alive,

29
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:35.100
someone's rocking at the right way.
No doubt.

30
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.860
I remember that time we spent literally a whole day.

31
00:01:37.861 --> 00:01:40.560
We were looking for pitfalls.
For me.
We have to find,
I was like,

32
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:44.210
I want to jaws on a leash.
I just want a life support system for jars.

33
00:01:44.211 --> 00:01:47.190
You're like,
all right,
me too.
And so we,
we ended up looking at,

34
00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.050
I saw this one that it said there's no bull in our pits and we get there and

35
00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:54.780
this guy clearly fought his past.
Oh yeah,
that guy.
Do you know where that guy,

36
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.200
you'll have more than I thought when I,
when I,
when have a dog killed the goats,

37
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.390
killed goats.
It attacked the baby cow.

38
00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:01.980
By the time they will shoot it to death it.

39
00:02:01.981 --> 00:02:04.500
Meanwhile it was this 35 pound little dog.

40
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:05.910
That's what people don't know about pit bulls.

41
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.820
The really crazy ones aren't like the big muscle ones.

42
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:12.060
The really crazy ones or the little ones because they can pick them up and move

43
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.520
around easier and fight.
This thing will look like a big,
they're bred,

44
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.540
they're not bred for like the bread,
the fighting weight classes,

45
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.810
the baddest motherfuckers on these little 35 pounders and that's what he had.

46
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.230
The dog did not look like a pit bull.
Like,
if you think of a pit bull,

47
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:27.310
you think of this like crazy muscular.
Yeah.

48
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.620
Concoction of science and breeding like a fleshlight of,
that's right.

49
00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:33.000
We're going to talk about this before we get going.

50
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.760
We are sponsored by the flashlight.
This is,

51
00:02:35.761 --> 00:02:37.980
we have a sponsor for our podcast and if we don't get,

52
00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:39.390
we were supposed to talk about in the beginning of the show,

53
00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.420
if you've never used one of the things,
these things I highly recommended.

54
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.100
I know you are a fellow pervert your feel that I sure haven't.

55
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.450
I have not fucked up.
You have at a reseller.
That's the butthole version.

56
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.740
The Bud Oh version.
And Dude,
it's way better than beating off.
I mean it's,

57
00:02:52.741 --> 00:02:55.860
it's a fucking incredible invention.
Yeah.
Well,
I've seen these used in poor,

58
00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.830
not that I ever watched should be something that every man has for real.

59
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.810
Because look,
if you,
if you masturbate and you do,
okay,
everyone does.
Yeah.

60
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.790
Come on.
You don't have 50 bucks laying around to,
to give yourself some pleasure.

61
00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.870
There's a lot of girls who you won't call after you fucked up.

62
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.820
I'm going to be honest with you,
I'm sticking my finger in this.
And it's true.

63
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:16.570
It's true.
This feels really good.
It feels awesome,
dude.
There's a lot of girls,

64
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:17.860
there's a lot of girls that you would not,

65
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:20.140
especially when you're young and dumb and you know,
you're just,

66
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.950
your Dick is totally leading your life.
That shit could save your career.

67
00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.890
That's shit could push you in a positive direction.

68
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.320
They've gay ones where it's a little butts.
So instead of like the cheeks,

69
00:03:32.321 --> 00:03:34.880
that's like a little butt cheeks.
Have you seen that?
Yeah.

70
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.550
Where k one flashlight.com or get a judgment and say you go to my website,

71
00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:41.910
you click on the link,
there's like a 15% discount again.

72
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.140
So you have to talk about that in the beginning.
But you know what,

73
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:47.190
I would talk about it anyway just if I didn't know and then I found out.

74
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.160
People need to know.
Yeah,
I'm surprised at the things are more popular.
Fantastic.

75
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.760
But yeah,
these are a little pit bulls back to,
uh,
our,
uh,
our story.
I mean,

76
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:57.730
you had,
you had the craziest little guy.
He was awesome.

77
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.560
You had squigy I remember it wasn't a squeaky Fromme squeeze group killed my
dog.

78
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.570
She came,
she was a coffee table.

79
00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.890
I've never seen a dog that she looked like an allergen.

80
00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.540
And the reason why I got this fucking dog,
this dog was a prison dog,
right?

81
00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:14.650
This dog was in the,
like literally in the,
the,
the La is in the POW.

82
00:04:14.651 --> 00:04:17.560
I go loyalty from the pound and was there for awhile.
Nobody wanted this dog.

83
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.210
It's crazy.
Little muscular pit bull.

84
00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.320
And a Brian calls me with his ex girlfriend who's also fucking crazy.

85
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:26.410
Patty Jenkins,
who is the director of that movie monster.

86
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.890
One of the coolest checks ever.
She's nuts too.
Okay.

87
00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:33.880
So that both nuts and they're both talking about this pit bull that I have to

88
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:37.960
rescue.
So they call me up and tell me I have to rescue this.
And I'm like,
fuck.

89
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.610
So I already have two dogs,
right?

90
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.390
And I make the cardinal sin of bringing a female home to another female.

91
00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.840
You cannot do now with pit bulls anyway.
No,
no.
You can't do with any dogs.

92
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:49.280
Apparently.
I want you to do a pound to get a pimple.

93
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.180
I seems like even because his friend,
his friend Brian,

94
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:56.050
Karen took one look at the dog away.
I said to Patty Ego,
if Joe sees this dog,

95
00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:00.700
he's going to adopt that.
He cannot resist.
Here's a problem.
I'm a retard.
Okay,

96
00:05:00.701 --> 00:05:02.050
and he's a retard as well,

97
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.650
and all retards need is another retard to agree with them and then they'll just

98
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:09.950
do something totally normal.
That's how Vegas was started and talent.

99
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.290
He just heard that,
right.
I'll buy it.

100
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.000
So just because it was already in his head like I was so susceptible.
It's like,

101
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:18.430
yeah,
really what she looked like.
She's like,

102
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:22.930
she's kind of fucking giant head and she's sold so solid genius.
I said,

103
00:05:22.931 --> 00:05:25.600
you should look for off the corrugator.
She looks like an alligator with pitbull.

104
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:30.310
Meanwhile,
she was the sweetest dog ever,
but she hated other dogs,
hated them.

105
00:05:30.311 --> 00:05:32.740
They're unforgiving,
unforgiving,
and ruthless.

106
00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:34.600
She was willing to fight for the death,

107
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.010
to fight to the death for your attention to fee.
I had a female police dog,

108
00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:42.160
German shepherd,
and a pit bull,
and they used to get in such bad vitamin for me.

109
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.670
I was just looking at $1,600 there and other $1,600 there is.

110
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:48.400
They're tearing each other up for the vet.
I got so good though.

111
00:05:48.401 --> 00:05:52.480
It choking them not just right on cod.
Problem is not when you're there,

112
00:05:52.481 --> 00:05:55.420
their problems when you're not.
Exactly.
And that's what happened with squeaking.

113
00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.920
Yeah.
She killed one of my dogs when I here.
Yeah,

114
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.670
<v 1>she's a crazy dog.
But she just did,
would not tolerate any bullshit.</v>

115
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.010
And because of the way they raise them,
man,
you know,
they,

116
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:05.720
they're just willing to fight to the death.

117
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:10.340
The game ones are the ones that get to s every other animal fights out of fear

118
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:13.710
or dominance and,
and dominance,
including territorial,
you know,
which,

119
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.530
which is under the umbrella of being territorial.

120
00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.750
Whereas a pit bulls actually are bread to actually enjoy the fight in a lot of

121
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:23.320
times in a fight crime,
we're into it.
They're wagging their tail.
You know,

122
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.080
they're great dogs.
If you,
if you raise them and you,
you know,

123
00:06:27.081 --> 00:06:28.370
you're there with them all the time.

124
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:30.620
They're super loving and really loyal companions,

125
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:33.260
but they're dangerous as fuck when it comes to other animals.

126
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.860
There's no doubt who crazy.
Yeah.
[inaudible] having them.

127
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.490
I prefer to not have them even though,
you know,
I loved my dogs.

128
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.450
They were awesome dogs.

129
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:46.010
They were super friendly and obedient and they were really like affectionate too

130
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:49.070
much man.
Too crazy.
It's crazy.
It's really dangerous.
You know,

131
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:52.940
people's other people's dogs get fucked up by your dog and you feel like a

132
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:54.050
Douche bag.
You know?

133
00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.990
It's like you can't take them to the dog park if they're on a lease.

134
00:06:56.991 --> 00:06:58.670
Might my dog bit at someone's face.

135
00:06:58.671 --> 00:07:02.540
Some someone's dog's face through the fence and grabbed a hold of it through

136
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:05.540
this dog fence.
We were walking.
I totally didn't expect it.

137
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.380
We were walking and he's on the leash and this dog sticks his head through the

138
00:07:09.381 --> 00:07:13.970
fence and he's like,
what?
Pitch Guy?
He's locked onto it so quick.

139
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.920
He had half of the fence in his teeth and half of his dogs phase.

140
00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.460
You have to choke them off.
Yeah,
I had a pole.

141
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:22.340
You have to grab his collar and twist it.
Yeah.
In the,
I had to put them to sleep.

142
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.870
I had to put them asleep a couple times.

143
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:26.270
I got to put them asleep when he was trying to kill my cat.
Yeah,

144
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.070
he was fucking nuts.
It was a great,
yeah,
thanks.
Fracture.

145
00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.050
He was a great dog like with people,

146
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:37.460
but with animals and it was not how I raised them.
It just is.

147
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.480
It's just their genetics.
Yeah.
You know,
I raised him around his car.

148
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.260
I raised them around cats and the more we let was around him all the time.

149
00:07:45.261 --> 00:07:49.130
It just,
they're just too crazy.
But the more we learn about genetics anyway,

150
00:07:49.131 --> 00:07:52.790
the more I realize it's so much.
It's a lot less nurture than it is nature.

151
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:56.630
We are slaves to our DNA and a lot of ways there's a lot of that going on for

152
00:07:56.631 --> 00:08:00.110
sure.
In both humans and in animals.
There's nothing you could do.
I mean there's,

153
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:02.720
it's all moving in a certain direction for a reason.
Okay.

154
00:08:02.721 --> 00:08:06.440
Cause this is the best way that the species stay strong,
you know?

155
00:08:06.441 --> 00:08:09.410
And there's a bunch of fucking chemicals and a lot of them are dictating your

156
00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:13.210
actions all the time.
And if you're a pit bull,
I mean,
how much of,
no,
no,
no.

157
00:08:13.211 --> 00:08:14.610
It's going to get in your head.
Very good.

158
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.050
Now the reason this book we were talking about yesterday where,
you know,

159
00:08:18.051 --> 00:08:22.460
genetically for thousands of years people have learned how to cross breed,

160
00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.161
you know,
and,
and,

161
00:08:23.161 --> 00:08:26.300
and whether it's plants or animals and come up with what they want.

162
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.830
But now with genetic engineering,

163
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:32.150
we're going to have crazy abilities on pinpoint accuracy,

164
00:08:32.151 --> 00:08:36.290
like combining and actual like alligator with,
you know,
I mean for real,
like,

165
00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.580
yeah,
I get it with a lion.
I mean they're,

166
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:41.300
they're doing crazy experiments where they can cross pollinate.
Yeah.
DNA.

167
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.870
That's totally inside the realm of possibility.
Yeah.
You know,
it's really nuts,

168
00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:47.010
man.
His dogs,
no one real,

169
00:08:47.011 --> 00:08:51.710
there's no real answer to how people bred dogs to be so crazy different.

170
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.440
And they all came from malls.
Genetically.
All dogs come from walls.

171
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.530
And that was like a big shock when they found that out because they're just

172
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:01.250
leaves a whole lot of questions like,
you know,
we don't,
you know,
haven't,

173
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:01.981
they don't know.

174
00:09:01.981 --> 00:09:04.440
They don't know where the delineation happened and how they all know.

175
00:09:04.441 --> 00:09:06.330
They thought it was a bunch of other wild candidates.

176
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.900
And I would have to double check this article because I don't really recall the

177
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:10.734
details of it,

178
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:15.510
but I remember that they were shocked that they found that dog's DNA was a

179
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.410
direct from wolves and that somehow or another,
a wolf became a Chihuahua.

180
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:22.920
You know,
a wool became a bulldog.
You know,
they just slowly,
bro,

181
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.890
how the fuck did that happen?
Well,
that,
that's,
that's breeding.

182
00:09:25.891 --> 00:09:29.010
That's thousands of years of breeding.
Seems wrong.
They can do that.
Supports it.

183
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.060
I know,
I know.
It's right.
But it seems wrong.
It seems like if you had to bet,

184
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.720
you know,
you'd be like,
how could that be?
Right.
How's that possible?

185
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:37.830
A fucking Chihuahua.
It came from a wolf,
right?

186
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.550
That there's no way could you make something that human beings as you,

187
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:44.160
as they learn more about the genome,
like they couldn't figure out why,
um,

188
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:46.800
aids never became a heterosexual disease in this country,

189
00:09:46.801 --> 00:09:48.630
but it was rampant in Africa.
Well,

190
00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:52.980
what they just discovered was that when you have a certain mutation on your
gene,

191
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:56.550
that mutation,
if you're northern European,
anybody really the,
you know,

192
00:09:56.551 --> 00:09:59.520
that's white,
uh,
or from of European descent,

193
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.720
they are the ones that survive the bubonic plague and everybody else died.

194
00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.080
And the people that survived that plague had a certain mutation in their gene

195
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:10.290
that also makes them,
uh,
HIV resistant.

196
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:14.550
Whereas the bubonic plague did not hit Africa.
Africa had its own diseases,

197
00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:17.790
but that particular plague never hit Africa.
So they never even,

198
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.720
they never developed a mutation in the gene to survive a plague like that.

199
00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.210
It's kind of crazy.
It's fucking nuts.
I'm smart.
Just,

200
00:10:27.211 --> 00:10:28.770
just the diversity of it all.

201
00:10:28.771 --> 00:10:31.800
It's just how different things are happening all the time.

202
00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:34.860
There's different diseases were fighting off and there's different things we're

203
00:10:34.861 --> 00:10:37.350
adapting to and who knows what's going on with our brains right now.

204
00:10:37.351 --> 00:10:40.890
Because of the different kinds of access to information that we have now with

205
00:10:40.891 --> 00:10:42.990
the Internet and you know,
just with social networking,

206
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:46.020
like there's so much more access to information right now.
Like what,

207
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.960
who knows what's changing in our minds because of that.
Well,

208
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.900
what about the fact that when this,
when we create a,

209
00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.720
an actual neural web where we have,

210
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:59.070
where everybody's genuinely connected to one specific club with something in

211
00:10:59.071 --> 00:11:03.960
your body.
Yeah.
So possible we'll get there all talking about this already.

212
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.621
Well there already are.

213
00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:08.880
They're already working on synthetic biology DNA that's synthetic that actually

214
00:11:08.881 --> 00:11:10.970
can grow in a petri dish.
You know what,

215
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.800
you're listening to science talk with Brian Calendar.
Joe Rogan.

216
00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:18.000
And did you ever think when you were doing that that you were in the hangover?

217
00:11:18.001 --> 00:11:20.160
Did you ever think that movie was going to be like movie of the year,

218
00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.150
the movie or the lie?
No idea.
That's,

219
00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.440
I remember showing up there and I went in for the audition for Todd Phillips,

220
00:11:25.441 --> 00:11:27.840
who have known for a while,
and I,
and I was planning on like a New York guy,

221
00:11:27.841 --> 00:11:30.150
you know,
hey,
how you doing?
I'm,
this is,
you know,
Eddie.
And I was,

222
00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.230
he likes when I improvised.

223
00:11:31.231 --> 00:11:34.840
So I was kind of improvising and I put a girl there and when I got to the,
uh,

224
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.800
reading,
I said,
you know,
maybe I'll play.
I'm like,
you know,
I'm from Lebanon,

225
00:11:37.801 --> 00:11:40.770
the ability,
if I make a Bagel prize,
ha ha,
laugh.
So I show up,

226
00:11:40.771 --> 00:11:44.340
I do my two days of work,
uh,
in Vegas,
but Bradley Cooper,

227
00:11:44.341 --> 00:11:46.650
I've known for eight years.
I've known Zack for 15.

228
00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:50.460
I've just done a movie with Ed Helms before that.
And I'm talking to these guys,

229
00:11:50.461 --> 00:11:53.730
name dropper.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
Named opera.
And,
but I remember saying,

230
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:55.900
we're talking to Bradley.
I was like,
how's it going?
He goes out,
I'll do it.

231
00:11:55.901 --> 00:11:58.100
I've done a bunch of movies.
I don't know if anybody's watching them,
you know,

232
00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.640
wow.
Money.
I'm not making it.
And just,

233
00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:03.370
it was this tiny movie where none of them were making any money.

234
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.640
I turn a Todd Phillips and I go,
how would you make them for this movie?
I mean,

235
00:12:06.641 --> 00:12:09.580
you know,
he makes good money.
He goes,
you're making more than I am.
I say,

236
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:10.240
what do you mean?
He goes,

237
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:13.870
I deferred my salary for a back end and I remember literally thinking to myself,

238
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:18.340
I went,
whatever dude,
you're out of your mind.
No stars.

239
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:20.980
It's a movie called the hangover in Vegas.

240
00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:24.670
Also wound has to do now is be good.
If it's good,

241
00:12:24.671 --> 00:12:27.220
people talk about it just through networking,

242
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:30.910
Facebook and Twitter and just find out about shit.
What you don't put the,

243
00:12:30.911 --> 00:12:32.080
well I don't,
maybe you can,

244
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:35.530
maybe you have a theory on why the hangover was a phenomenal thing because it

245
00:12:35.531 --> 00:12:38.470
was awesome because it was fun because people want to see it and they had a good

246
00:12:38.471 --> 00:12:40.450
time.
It's that simple.
Yeah,
it was a really,

247
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:43.840
I mean it was a really kind of almost like a cliche subject going to Vegas and

248
00:12:43.841 --> 00:12:46.930
going crazy and partying.
We wake up,
what happened?
What went wrong?

249
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.190
But it was done so well.
Every part about it.
It was great.
The acting was great.

250
00:12:51.191 --> 00:12:55.190
The stores were fun.
They were,
they were silly but yet believable enough.

251
00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:57.040
Phillips knows how to make a movie.

252
00:12:57.041 --> 00:13:01.000
That guy great basically wrote and directed bad Santa and the radios that that

253
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:05.910
was him.
They gave him a 40 minute like a thing in Harvey Weinstein was like,
Ah,

254
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.030
you got to save this movie.

255
00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:11.260
And he basically went back and rewrote and re did the whole thing and shot at.

256
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:16.180
That guy's crazy.
He's only Bob Thorton.
Oh,
oh yeah,
yeah.
That guy's a nice guy.

257
00:13:16.181 --> 00:13:20.500
Really,
really nice guy but definitely likes in Canada.

258
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:25.330
And it was on this really cool radio show and I think it's in Toronto and the

259
00:13:25.331 --> 00:13:29.830
guy was talking to him or the guy introduces him in the band and just for

260
00:13:29.831 --> 00:13:32.560
context states that this guy's a um,
you know,

261
00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:34.960
Academy Award winning actor and just,
you know,

262
00:13:34.961 --> 00:13:38.390
to try to like layer the store that this guy's a bad motherfucker.
Right,
right.

263
00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:39.760
Just giving him his props.

264
00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.640
Billy Bob goes into a hissy fit because the guy was not supposed to mention

265
00:13:42.641 --> 00:13:43.474
acting.

266
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.720
So he there you may believe for living dude.

267
00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:52.660
Exactly.
I'm not even like,
I'm a musician.
Do you not understand?

268
00:13:52.661 --> 00:13:54.880
I'm a musician and you know,
he's like,
you know,

269
00:13:54.881 --> 00:13:58.090
just like answering his questions all fucked up and we're just trying to throw

270
00:13:58.091 --> 00:14:00.970
the guy off and the guy handles it.
Amazingly.

271
00:14:00.971 --> 00:14:05.050
The guy just totally like rational talking,
you know?

272
00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.130
Totally calm.
Makes it through without any freak outs.
I mean,

273
00:14:08.131 --> 00:14:10.030
here he's got this fucking world famous,
you know,

274
00:14:10.031 --> 00:14:13.930
Academy Award winning actor who's clearly been crazy,
right?

275
00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:17.740
Like a mad at him because he mentioned that he happened to win an Oscar,
I think,

276
00:14:17.741 --> 00:14:21.010
five times.
Right?
I mean,
think about that for a second,
you know,
I mean,

277
00:14:21.011 --> 00:14:23.650
come on guys.
How crazy is Brad Pitt?

278
00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:26.830
Brad Pitt does not look at Angelina Jolie and goes,
wait a minute,

279
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.710
how nutty is this bitch?
She fucked this guy.
She fucked this guy.

280
00:14:30.711 --> 00:14:33.910
It used to take his blood and wear it around her neck.
Okay,

281
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:38.140
what if I'm at what's going on here?
It's probably really stung going,
dude,

282
00:14:38.141 --> 00:14:41.440
you got blood around your,
and you know,
like he's,
I think she just worked him.

283
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:42.640
I think she came in,

284
00:14:42.641 --> 00:14:47.500
I think she is an Alpha fucking female vaginal Predator kind of thing.

285
00:14:47.501 --> 00:14:51.610
She just grabbed him,
held him down and made a meter pussy and that was it.
Yeah,

286
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:56.140
she don,
she shot him off.
Yeah.
Middle by now.
And they're like,

287
00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:01.010
oh,
our goes away.
What power?
And her being able to be like,

288
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.090
oh,
I wish you made magic.
Maybe we just match it.
No,
no,
I was,

289
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.530
I don't mean to dis Brad Pitt and I don't really have anything against him,

290
00:15:09.531 --> 00:15:12.550
but I was listening to Larry King once and Larry King was talking to Scott.

291
00:15:12.551 --> 00:15:17.120
I was like,
fuck is this dummy?
And turned out to me Brad Pitt.

292
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.390
I was listening in my car.
I had no idea who the fuck it was.
I was like,

293
00:15:20.391 --> 00:15:23.720
this guy's an idiot.
Yeah.
Larry King's talk to me.
What does this guy do it,

294
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:28.310
we'll be right back with Brad Pitt.
And I was like,
wow,
Brad Pitt is dumb.

295
00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:30.140
I mean,
look,
he's a fucking actor.

296
00:15:30.141 --> 00:15:32.060
He doesn't have to be smart and maybe he is smart.

297
00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:35.680
He's just not smarter taught nobody ever.
I always say,
well the answer might be,

298
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:39.710
I mean some people come off badly and interviews.
I know I had,
he's a simple guy.

299
00:15:39.711 --> 00:15:43.520
I think he's a simple guy who had a certain bone structure that cut light well

300
00:15:43.521 --> 00:15:44.354
and he was,

301
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:46.970
his strength is he's not afraid to look bad and not afraid to take chances.

302
00:15:46.971 --> 00:15:50.240
He keeps trying to be really good and I think he's a really good actor.

303
00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:53.090
Like I thought it was awesome and interview with a vampire that's like one of my

304
00:15:53.091 --> 00:15:54.080
favorite roles ever.

305
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:59.240
Roll now and become a victim to his good looks like he's always trying to do

306
00:15:59.481 --> 00:16:02.530
something different and his production company makes a lot of money.

307
00:16:02.531 --> 00:16:05.690
It does really makes really good movies.
I'm not saying he really is a retarded,

308
00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.930
I really do enjoy is acting.
I think you just thought a fight club.

309
00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.660
When I was listening to him I was like,
because he's a movie star

310
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:16.190
and intelligence.
Well it's also,
it's not even that.

311
00:16:16.191 --> 00:16:18.920
It's just usually it's the ability to project.
A lot of times people,

312
00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:19.790
they can be smart,

313
00:16:19.791 --> 00:16:22.970
just they're not that good at stringing words together and you know,

314
00:16:22.971 --> 00:16:24.980
and coming off smart,
very positive.
You know,

315
00:16:24.981 --> 00:16:26.780
also intelligence is compartmentalize.

316
00:16:26.781 --> 00:16:28.670
You can be very smart in one area and not smart at all.

317
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.710
And I think that with someone like Brad Pitt,

318
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.280
I don't think it ever made it was ever relevant for him until probably recently

319
00:16:34.281 --> 00:16:38.330
with Angelina Jolie to even read a whole lot about other things.
You know,

320
00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:41.210
when you're a prince and Hollywood and you're spending a lot of time on set,

321
00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:45.660
you can,
you can create deficits that way or not filling the holes you need to.

322
00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:48.350
One of the things that I loved about Brian when I first met him,
it was like,

323
00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:51.680
here's this guy who was an actor who wasn't like actors cause I'd only been in

324
00:16:51.681 --> 00:16:56.480
Hollywood,
but I met Brian for about a year and I was just sick of it.

325
00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:00.920
I was ready to go back home.
I was ready to quit,
quit acting and go uh,

326
00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:04.700
and a and just go back to standup comedy in New York.
I just didn't like actors.

327
00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:09.080
And then I got news radio and then I decided to stay and then I met Brian.

328
00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:12.440
But he was like the first actor that I met that wasn't like an actor cause we're

329
00:17:12.441 --> 00:17:13.370
both on news radio.

330
00:17:13.371 --> 00:17:17.360
At one time he played my brother Nick Depaulo putting my other brother.

331
00:17:17.361 --> 00:17:21.440
That was awesome.
But when,
you know,
when,
when I first came on the site,

332
00:17:21.441 --> 00:17:23.680
here's a perfect example,
Brian and I were,

333
00:17:23.681 --> 00:17:26.940
were hanging out in this cafeteria and we were eating and uh,

334
00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:30.740
Brian was doing some impression or something and I was laughing fucking

335
00:17:30.741 --> 00:17:32.900
hysterically.
It was really funny shit.

336
00:17:32.901 --> 00:17:36.470
And this other guy who was the actor who's on the show with this as well,

337
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.670
was trying just to top Brian kept trying to top him like everything Brian would

338
00:17:40.671 --> 00:17:43.720
say.
He'd be like Janette,
he'd be like,
man,
pitch.
I got shit.

339
00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:48.310
And it was like really loud and trying too hard.
And second sharp f.

340
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.480
When you're listening to a and somebody's going pro with a horn,
you're like,
Ooh,

341
00:17:51.481 --> 00:17:55.140
it's blowing that horn over there.
It was just,
you know,

342
00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:58.580
immediately I could see like,
okay,
here's,
here's an actor.
This isn't,

343
00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:01.990
that guy's an actor.
That's what they're like,
you know,
or any,

344
00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:05.040
any of those really creepy,
needy Hollywood people.

345
00:18:05.041 --> 00:18:06.670
They wouldn't have to be an actor.
You know,

346
00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.270
you could be a comic and be like that.
You could be,
you could be anything,

347
00:18:09.271 --> 00:18:12.810
but you'd be a singer and be like that.
But it's that creepy needy enter.

348
00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:16.860
It has to do with not having perspective and putting yourself at the center of

349
00:18:16.861 --> 00:18:18.210
the universe.
That's what a lot of actors do.

350
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:21.360
Like they actually think that what they're doing and what they think and what

351
00:18:21.361 --> 00:18:24.090
they have to say is historically relevant.

352
00:18:24.420 --> 00:18:27.660
And that comes from being a self involved to the nth degree,

353
00:18:27.661 --> 00:18:30.880
which in some ways I feel almost you need for free sometimes to be an,

354
00:18:30.881 --> 00:18:34.740
that also is because of the environment on sets of when you're on a set,

355
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.830
everyone's kissing your ass.
You are,
if you're the star of your,
you know,

356
00:18:37.831 --> 00:18:39.450
like some big guy and you're on a set,

357
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:43.650
everyone is relying on you to pay their bills.

358
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:45.960
Your success means that,
you know,

359
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.750
they get to keep their job and they get to buy a new house.

360
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:52.140
So they're always kissing the actresses like you're treated like roots.

361
00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:54.510
Ridiculous.
You could,
you could be wrong about things.

362
00:18:54.511 --> 00:18:57.690
People won't argue and you see it,
you see it like all the time.
Yeah.

363
00:18:57.750 --> 00:19:01.710
So people create their own eating on create their own reality and then everybody

364
00:19:01.711 --> 00:19:04.560
kind of enters into this mutual agreement that they're going out,
they're gonna,

365
00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:08.820
they're gonna,
they're gonna sort of keep your reality a reality,
especially when,

366
00:19:08.821 --> 00:19:10.470
you know,
if you're working long hours,

367
00:19:10.471 --> 00:19:14.640
which they are in a lot of movies and especially like a lot of our TV shows,

368
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.230
they work long ass fucking hours and people get cranky.
And when you get cranky,

369
00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:22.030
want to just yell to get things done,
well that starts a precedent.
And then they,

370
00:19:22.031 --> 00:19:24.660
they,
they get used to yelling at people and then it becomes,

371
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:27.630
they're allowed to yell at people.
Then it becomes,
oh,
here's that crazy actor.

372
00:19:27.631 --> 00:19:29.430
He's running everything.
Everybody quiet,
quiet,
quiet.

373
00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.900
So they get this completely distorted perception of where they fit in the real

374
00:19:33.901 --> 00:19:36.540
circle of life.
It's fucking pretenders,

375
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.730
but they're locked in this weird social system that like rewards it.

376
00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.020
Have you guys met John Lithgo and what does he like?
I'm,
I have,
I read,
I did a,

377
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:47.760
um,
I auditioned with him once and he read with me.
It was kind of exciting.

378
00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.100
He was on third rock from the sun when I was on news radio.

379
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.600
I've got to meet him at one of those NBC press junket things.
Yeah.

380
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:53.880
He's a cool dude.

381
00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:57.060
He's a real actor and he does a lot of states still in New York and,

382
00:19:57.510 --> 00:20:02.100
and a very nice guy.
A really,
really,
who's that guy from Fargo?

383
00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:06.840
The guy would,
Joe Montana.
Who's that guy?
What's his name?
Oh,
Bill.

384
00:20:06.841 --> 00:20:11.490
Bill Macy.
Bill Mason.
Yeah.
Hilarious actor.
Really,
really,

385
00:20:11.491 --> 00:20:15.960
really awesome.
Actually,
I met him once and uh,
I said,
hey man,

386
00:20:15.961 --> 00:20:18.540
I really love that movie you did with Joe,
Monta [inaudible]

387
00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:24.780
and he just,
he makes this Joe Joe Montana.

388
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:29.350
W how was his name?
Joe Montana.
Joe Montana.
Yeah.
My tenure.
Yeah.
So he goes,

389
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.090
it's a Joe Montana.
So he says that to me and I'm like,
God,

390
00:20:33.091 --> 00:20:37.340
I'm not fucking idiot guys saying you really like something and say,
yeah,

391
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.400
I mean it's like one of the few guys that ever want to meet.

392
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:42.600
I mean Fargo is one of my favorite movies ever.
So like me meeting him was like,

393
00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:47.630
wow,
really meeting this guy.
And he's like,
it's chill Tanya.
Like,
oh sorry guys,

394
00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.130
I gotta go

395
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.490
<v 2>now.
Just so such a piece of shit.
I mean you make to,</v>

396
00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:53.810
he is thinking he's the guy from the sopranos.
Oh,
pussy.
Yeah.

397
00:20:53.850 --> 00:20:57.700
They're always think of Joey Diaz as big pussy.
Pronto's that's funny.
Well,

398
00:20:57.701 --> 00:20:59.110
so what,
I mean,

399
00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.710
what was it like for you coming into Hollywood and dealing with all these actor

400
00:21:02.711 --> 00:21:06.970
type human beings?
Because it is like,
it's really is for people who don't know,

401
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:11.230
for people who have regular,
regular jobs,
it is shocking when you're,

402
00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.700
when you first get around actor,
it's shocking.
Yeah.

403
00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.460
Because they're telling you two plus two is 16 and and it,

404
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:20.590
it's just the weirdest world money.
They're all democrats,
all of them.

405
00:21:20.591 --> 00:21:23.750
Because I believe that there's such thing as being able to socially engineer

406
00:21:23.751 --> 00:21:27.070
equality quality and that that Washington knows what to do with your mind.

407
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:31.360
They think that,
I think they think that the left is the best.

408
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:36.310
They think that going left and and being like this socially aware person makes

409
00:21:36.311 --> 00:21:37.900
you look cooler in Hollywood.

410
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:42.640
It's like a mindset that they adopt without really considering any of the

411
00:21:42.641 --> 00:21:46.630
different aspects of that mindset.
It's just,
it's a Hollywood theme.
Right.

412
00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.960
I was going to say it a lot of times I find that they don't know that there's an

413
00:21:49.961 --> 00:21:53.140
alternative out there.
They don't know that.
Just saying,
you know,

414
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:56.280
just because you're not left wing doesn't mean you're a quote unquote
Republican.

415
00:21:56.281 --> 00:21:59.110
Do you know Tracy,
when you hear a wheeze,

416
00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:02.560
when you hear like people go like they talk about the Democratic Party,
like,
wow,

417
00:22:02.561 --> 00:22:06.300
we've got to win this guy.
Yeah.
It's like you're thinking like it's the Dodgers.

418
00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.760
So also it's a collectivist mindset,
which if you look at history,

419
00:22:09.761 --> 00:22:12.260
has never really produced any results at all.
The,

420
00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:15.940
the what makes this country great is individuals who take a chance and get

421
00:22:15.941 --> 00:22:19.290
rewarded for it.
Come on,
coming up with ideas and,
and,

422
00:22:19.291 --> 00:22:22.960
and in a way that's actually the best way to create a community.
Yeah.

423
00:22:22.961 --> 00:22:26.770
I mean it should have to rely on each other as a broad spectrum of ideas.

424
00:22:26.771 --> 00:22:30.280
To lump them into two competing camps is absolutely ridiculous,

425
00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:35.170
especially when people just jump on either camp and everything they say is

426
00:22:35.171 --> 00:22:39.230
Gospel and you're in the Andrew Tall if you don't believe exactly.
You said it.

427
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:39.941
It's like team,

428
00:22:39.941 --> 00:22:42.430
it's like two different teams when you listen or watch the elections,

429
00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:44.520
our team versus your team and,

430
00:22:44.521 --> 00:22:47.440
and any of your ideas be damned because my team's going to win.

431
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.600
My favorite guy that I know that I used to know who was a,
a,

432
00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:56.080
a real like liberal leftist,
like really like everything.

433
00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:59.970
Liberals wanted reparations for slavery,
for Real,
um,

434
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.680
believed that what he called himself a feminist.

435
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:08.090
I'm not bullshitting.
He calls himself a fandom us in when he was married.
Uh,

436
00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:12.910
I believe he even changed his name.
He changed his wife's name,
hyphenated,

437
00:23:12.911 --> 00:23:16.030
and her name was last.
Oh,
what's trying to reinvent the wheel?

438
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.970
He hyphenated and not,
she hyphenated,

439
00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:23.320
hyphenated his own name and accepted hers last,
it's like the dominant name.

440
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.620
That's like the hot tub time machine.
Two Great.
This guy was like,

441
00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:28.540
his body was made of Jello.

442
00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:33.490
His hands were frail and tiny and his testosterone hips were odd.

443
00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:37.360
He had none.
He had not,
he walked funny.
There's like a funny walked him.
He,
he,

444
00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:40.690
he just had no ability to get out of the way of anything,

445
00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:43.750
but that's like his way of making themselves feel significant was his game.

446
00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.380
His game was,
you know,

447
00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:50.150
I am going to support your rights as a woman more than a man than a,

448
00:23:50.151 --> 00:23:53.840
than other women will.
I will do it as a man.
Yeah.
That's my,
that's his rap.
Yes,

449
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:55.680
that's right.
It's all,
it's all,
it's all like,

450
00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.550
that's that he figured out that that got him laid a couple of times and then

451
00:23:58.551 --> 00:24:00.860
just bought into it.
That's all he had available.

452
00:24:00.861 --> 00:24:03.650
What is it going to do is either going to do that or going to collect guns.

453
00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:07.430
You that's just good too.
And he's got one of the other bro,

454
00:24:07.431 --> 00:24:08.560
you gotta to go one extra.
You're gonna,

455
00:24:08.561 --> 00:24:10.400
you're compensating whether you like it or not.

456
00:24:10.401 --> 00:24:13.090
You Dick is an inch long and you're made of Jello.
All right.

457
00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.130
You're compensated disaster.
The,

458
00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:19.700
he was my favorite example of someone who was just like this guy was like wood

459
00:24:19.701 --> 00:24:23.230
tree.
You could not have a discussion about something.
You know,

460
00:24:23.231 --> 00:24:25.850
you could not have a discussion about,
you know,
war.

461
00:24:25.851 --> 00:24:30.140
You could not have a discussion about politics,
anything that involved,
you know,

462
00:24:30.141 --> 00:24:32.480
the Democrats and the Republicans.
You could not have it.

463
00:24:32.481 --> 00:24:35.060
Cause as soon as you had an opposing point of view,
we'll like,

464
00:24:35.061 --> 00:24:39.530
you don't think that maybe it's a good idea to pay attention to really radical

465
00:24:39.531 --> 00:24:41.900
groups all over the world.
You don't think that may be is a good idea.

466
00:24:41.901 --> 00:24:43.430
And that's maybe kept people safe.

467
00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:47.540
You fucking right wing the Andrew Hall's so he shuts you down.
Oh yeah.

468
00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:49.820
Immediately built a wall around you.

469
00:24:49.821 --> 00:24:53.960
And so now you're on that name calling and defines you and it's always,
you know,

470
00:24:53.961 --> 00:24:57.510
right wing,
which I am the last person to be right wing or anyway,
I always,

471
00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:01.010
I always reject.
I always,
um,
I,
I'm more of a libertarian.

472
00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:02.610
I've just always believed that,

473
00:25:02.611 --> 00:25:05.600
that I believe that human beings know how to govern themselves.

474
00:25:05.601 --> 00:25:07.040
I think you have to have a certain amount of government.

475
00:25:07.041 --> 00:25:09.140
I believe you have to have roads and you have to have a strong defense.

476
00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:12.500
You have to have police force.
I believe in that stuff.
However,
I think we are,

477
00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:14.990
and I don't want to say we're headed toward this trend,

478
00:25:14.991 --> 00:25:17.110
but I think that the danger is always been,

479
00:25:17.111 --> 00:25:20.000
and George Washington said that people will invent lost to take their own power

480
00:25:20.001 --> 00:25:22.610
away from them.
Uh,
W W W we're always,

481
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.020
there's always a danger that a centralized bureaucracy will get enough power,

482
00:25:27.021 --> 00:25:30.530
become a leviathan where it just starts needing more and more resources and then

483
00:25:30.531 --> 00:25:34.700
you lose your freedoms.
You do in the name of making the world a better place.

484
00:25:34.701 --> 00:25:39.530
It's always a benevolent,
a concept behind it.
But,
um,
I,

485
00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:43.640
I think that the best way to look at things is when people say you're a

486
00:25:43.641 --> 00:25:46.640
conservative.
Well,
I was,
I don't like that.

487
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.490
I don't like when people say that because what they're saying is that I am

488
00:25:49.491 --> 00:25:50.800
somehow,
um,

489
00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.880
it has in its connotation the idea that I am a very stodgy and very strict and

490
00:25:56.331 --> 00:26:00.200
very controlling.
Whereas I'm actually quite the opposite.
I believe I'm,
I'm,

491
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:01.710
you could call me right wings,

492
00:26:01.711 --> 00:26:05.450
certainly not left wing because I believe in maximum personal freedom.

493
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:09.050
I believe you should legalize drugs because I think people know essentially how

494
00:26:09.051 --> 00:26:12.080
to govern themselves and if they don't,
there are people going to drugs anyway.

495
00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:15.650
That's just one example.
But I think for the most part,
um,

496
00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.250
you government should be treated like a necessary evil,

497
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.730
not a huge engine for good cause.

498
00:26:21.731 --> 00:26:26.350
The only problem with legalizing drugs is that if this is,

499
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:30.740
this is a,
I mean this is an argument and I'm not exactly sure I support it,

500
00:26:30.741 --> 00:26:31.730
but this is the argument.

501
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:36.970
The argument is that if you made drugs legal than big corporations would step in

502
00:26:37.401 --> 00:26:40.640
and be even more out of control because they would realize that the real money

503
00:26:40.641 --> 00:26:43.980
is in selling people these drugs that used to be illegal and they would package

504
00:26:43.981 --> 00:26:45.840
them and make them very cheap and very available.

505
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.990
And because of the fact there'd be so much of it because there'd be profit in it

506
00:26:48.991 --> 00:26:50.880
that people would do it that wouldn't ordinarily do it.

507
00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:52.500
I don't necessarily buy it,

508
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:57.060
but I do think that you have to be really careful of allowing anybody to make a

509
00:26:57.061 --> 00:27:00.990
living or make money or get rich off of something that can fuck other people up.

510
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:04.530
Cigarettes,
cigarettes,
and alcohol.
Say Pimps.

511
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:06.780
The people that are sound cigarettes right now,
look,

512
00:27:06.781 --> 00:27:09.240
I know there's billions and billions of dollars in cigarettes,

513
00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:12.570
but you know what the fuck you're doing.
You know what the fuck you're doing,

514
00:27:12.571 --> 00:27:14.580
period.
There's no debate anymore.

515
00:27:14.581 --> 00:27:18.810
This isn't 1950s with those camel ads on TV or putting your doctor recommends

516
00:27:18.811 --> 00:27:21.250
camels.
You know,
it's not that you're,

517
00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:24.990
you're fucking yourself for sure and you're making billions of dollars off

518
00:27:24.991 --> 00:27:26.130
people fucking themselves.

519
00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:28.710
But don't you think that there's always going to be a segment of the population

520
00:27:28.711 --> 00:27:31.140
that is going to just abuse themselves?

521
00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.680
I think that certain people do drugs and whether or not they're legal or not,

522
00:27:34.681 --> 00:27:38.920
it may would probably raise the,
that the,
um,
the usage maybe.

523
00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:41.880
But for the most part,
I think when people who want to get high,

524
00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:45.510
they find a way to get home.
It's true.
But the idea that you can profit off that,

525
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:46.650
I think,
I don't,

526
00:27:46.651 --> 00:27:49.470
I don't think you should be able to profit off of fucking people over.

527
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.660
People are profiting now.
You know,
I know the local drug dealers,
so no,

528
00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:55.820
I don't think that should be legal.
Um,
I think,
you know,

529
00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:00.510
I'm all for drugs being a statement.
Yeah.
I'm all,
I'm all for drugs,

530
00:28:00.511 --> 00:28:05.040
being legal.
I'm not for,
you know,
I'm totally for social dog Darwinism,

531
00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.890
but I can see this as an argument.
That's all I'm saying.

532
00:28:07.891 --> 00:28:09.780
I'm not saying that I support it.
I'm saying,

533
00:28:09.781 --> 00:28:13.020
I can see the argument that if you did,
there would be more access.

534
00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:14.190
There would be more of an end,

535
00:28:14.191 --> 00:28:16.410
you would have even more of a problem than we have already have.

536
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:20.160
Corporations being basically sociopathic,
you know,
not caring,

537
00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:21.600
but he's top of the head of every,
you know,

538
00:28:21.601 --> 00:28:25.680
these questions are getting only more and more relevant and deeper and deeper

539
00:28:25.681 --> 00:28:30.120
and,
and this is the other issue.
We are now coming out with technology.

540
00:28:30.121 --> 00:28:31.020
The genie's out of the bottle.

541
00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:33.900
We're coming up with technology that has potential,
do incredible good,

542
00:28:33.901 --> 00:28:36.690
but incredibly be also be incredibly destructive.
For example,

543
00:28:37.050 --> 00:28:40.710
is scientists are now learning how to create new life forms at of synthetic

544
00:28:40.711 --> 00:28:42.240
material that's,
that have never existed.

545
00:28:42.241 --> 00:28:45.120
And they're creating self replicating proteins.
What does that mean?

546
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.180
That means that at the in 2030 40 years,
nobody knows,

547
00:28:48.181 --> 00:28:50.660
but this stuff is moving exponentially.
You're going have,

548
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:53.910
you're probably going to have computers,
machines,
whatever you want to call them,

549
00:28:53.911 --> 00:28:57.120
that replicate themselves,
right?
Yeah.
What do you do?

550
00:28:57.121 --> 00:29:01.220
What is the dialogue and what are the questions that accompany that w what?

551
00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.240
What is to say that these machines won't,

552
00:29:03.241 --> 00:29:06.420
we'll have a respect for their biological heritage.
You tell me,

553
00:29:06.421 --> 00:29:09.150
is there a guarantee?
There probably isn't.
No,
there's no guarantee.

554
00:29:09.151 --> 00:29:12.090
And if they become intelligent and they developed some sort of a self defense

555
00:29:12.091 --> 00:29:14.830
mechanism,
then it's like skynet.
That's what I mean really.

556
00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:16.890
That's what every computer scientist,

557
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.280
that is the conversation that guys like Ray Kurzweil and these computer

558
00:29:20.281 --> 00:29:21.870
scientists are talking about.
Yeah.

559
00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:24.390
It's a real conversation that's not being addressed anywhere else when people

560
00:29:24.391 --> 00:29:28.080
are talking about Lindsay Lohan going to jail.
Well exactly,
exactly.

561
00:29:28.081 --> 00:29:30.390
And that's the tidal wave that's coming that nobody sees.

562
00:29:30.391 --> 00:29:33.330
Very few people see that,
that we're gonna.
I think we're,

563
00:29:33.331 --> 00:29:36.570
our futures are going to be so radically altered in the next 20 years.

564
00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.580
I think ways we can't even comprehend.

565
00:29:38.581 --> 00:29:42.460
I don't think we even aware of how radical the changes have been that have taken

566
00:29:42.461 --> 00:29:46.300
place in our life.
Right.
Things are gradual.
You get used to it.
You know,

567
00:29:46.301 --> 00:29:49.360
we used to the fact that we're doing this thing right now and you know,

568
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:53.560
thousands of people listening to it live and it's going out all over the world

569
00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:56.140
as a podcast,
hundreds of thousands of people,

570
00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:00.460
and it's through just to fucking sitting in a room in my house.
Well,
by the way,

571
00:30:00.461 --> 00:30:04.480
the Internet is just 5,000 days old.
They Internet is 5,000 days old.
Nobody.

572
00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.160
And there were people that were never realized,
put it into context,

573
00:30:06.161 --> 00:30:08.110
but if you think about the,
how long,
it's been around for 15 years,

574
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:11.020
that's 5,000 days.
A little over 5,000 days.
So,

575
00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.960
so the Internet has just been around for 5,000 days now.

576
00:30:13.961 --> 00:30:16.630
What's going to happen in 20,000 days?

577
00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:21.530
She's crying about how fast this stuff is moving.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's,

578
00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:25.720
it's staggering.
It's,
it's hard to really wrap your head around it.

579
00:30:25.721 --> 00:30:28.360
It's hard to wrap your head around the fact that 200 years ago,

580
00:30:28.361 --> 00:30:32.200
the best way to get around was derived and animal to,
which by the way,

581
00:30:32.201 --> 00:30:35.740
is a lot sexier than a high.
Wanted a picture of someone.
You had to draw it.
Yeah.

582
00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.850
There was no cameras 200 years ago.
That's incredible.
It's just incredible.

583
00:30:39.851 --> 00:30:43.210
That's two lifetimes,
two lifetimes,
and everything's right.

584
00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:47.170
<v 1>We changed.
Yeah.
The Internet's totally like a drug nowadays.</v>

585
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:49.360
They're going to find a way to sell the internet to you,

586
00:30:49.361 --> 00:30:51.010
like a drug a little bit.
You know?

587
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:54.370
I just can't believe that the government's not like grabbing a hold of the

588
00:30:54.371 --> 00:30:57.820
Internet and trying to make as much money as possible out of it.
It can.

589
00:30:57.821 --> 00:31:00.730
The government,
it'll be a problem.
As you look at it as the government,

590
00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.860
the government,
but the government,

591
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:06.700
it's like it would be great if there was only like 10 people in the earth and

592
00:31:06.701 --> 00:31:09.640
there was like two dudes and they were the government.
Then that would work,

593
00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:11.770
but the same people that would profit off drugs.

594
00:31:11.771 --> 00:31:14.890
Then the same people that would profit off.
Well,
how would they do that?

595
00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.210
Brian would a sensor it.
They would know.

596
00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:22.600
I don't think Congress,
I mean you're talking about,
first of all the government,

597
00:31:22.601 --> 00:31:24.440
the government is,
is this several different ways.

598
00:31:24.441 --> 00:31:27.730
It's about 50 different competing entities.
Right?
I don't think it's possible,

599
00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:29.690
but I'm just saying that it's amazing that they know,

600
00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:33.760
which brings up the subject that I wanted to talk about HR five,
seven,

601
00:31:33.761 --> 00:31:37.450
four one slavery.
This is that.
Yeah.
Charlie rangle.

602
00:31:37.451 --> 00:31:40.780
I think that's how he started saying wrangle.
Yeah.
He,
uh,

603
00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:46.020
<v 2>proposing this build that everyone served two years of service mandatory</v>

604
00:31:47.111 --> 00:31:50.290
service,
whether it'd be in the military or military support.
No.

605
00:31:50.291 --> 00:31:55.150
And the reason why he's proposing this is because he believes that the war is

606
00:31:55.151 --> 00:31:57.700
wrong and that he wants to,
uh,

607
00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:01.840
make a point by if these congressmen aren't willing to go themselves,

608
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.200
if they're not willing to send their family and their loved ones,

609
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:08.740
then they shouldn't be supporting this war.
Which is,
it's very fair.

610
00:32:08.741 --> 00:32:11.440
It makes sense.
But the problem is it's still,

611
00:32:11.441 --> 00:32:16.000
it's like you can't even offer that up as an option.
As a rational option.

612
00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:19.690
You can't offer up two years mandatory service.
Fuck you asshole.

613
00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:22.450
<v 1>No,
fuck you.
To make a point.
You know,
if you want to make a point,</v>

614
00:32:22.451 --> 00:32:23.284
do with your mouth.

615
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:28.320
Don't propose shit that when slave people [inaudible] that's not gonna work.

616
00:32:28.361 --> 00:32:32.190
But it works the way it works.
It works here in Israel.

617
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.430
We had it here for a long time.

618
00:32:33.431 --> 00:32:37.540
We had a mandatory draft until the 19 cc that was a draft.

619
00:32:37.541 --> 00:32:41.330
That's a little bit different.
This is service for every single person.

620
00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:46.520
Everyone's doing countries.
Everyone served two years.
Mandatory minimum.
Yeah.

621
00:32:46.521 --> 00:32:48.710
But you know,
good luck Charlie.
I mean,
good luck trying to get,

622
00:32:48.711 --> 00:32:51.290
that's not going to get it passed and I don't think he wants to get it passed

623
00:32:51.291 --> 00:32:54.980
but by people may in a point.
But even that point suggesting that is,

624
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:56.510
that's like fucking treason.

625
00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:59.940
I just put it out there that that's a rational argument.
Your,

626
00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:03.910
you are lowering the standards of opposition.
You're saying,
you know,
if,
I mean,

627
00:33:03.911 --> 00:33:07.670
if you're supposed to be the thing that's protecting us from the military

628
00:33:07.671 --> 00:33:09.770
industrial complex and the global machine,

629
00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.920
it's supposed to be our elected representatives and our elected representatives

630
00:33:12.921 --> 00:33:17.540
are proposing that everyone be enslaved by the fucking country and being forced

631
00:33:17.541 --> 00:33:21.050
to do two years of mandatory service,
no matter what your job is.
Fuck you.

632
00:33:21.051 --> 00:33:25.160
Exactly.
Fuck you.
By the way,
by the way,
that's exactly what I'm talking about.

633
00:33:25.161 --> 00:33:28.220
Government will,
if you give,
if you allow government to,

634
00:33:28.221 --> 00:33:32.690
and I'm talking about just any,
any Leviathan,
any,
any huge court,
they,
they will,

635
00:33:32.691 --> 00:33:37.490
they will take your power away from you to laundry shows that time and time

636
00:33:37.491 --> 00:33:40.460
again.
It doesn't have to be right or left wing about that.
That's just a,

637
00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.350
that's to open a history book.

638
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:46.540
History runs on momentum and the problem is the arc.

639
00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.450
Our Society is so complex that 90% of the people,

640
00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:54.710
90% of the time are doing shit that they don't want to be doing to support the

641
00:33:54.711 --> 00:33:59.330
machine.
The machine is that big.
That's right.
It's so we'll think about what,

642
00:33:59.331 --> 00:34:02.300
when taxes are 48% in some brackets or,
or,

643
00:34:02.301 --> 00:34:06.050
well actually in this country that 38% 38% of your day is working for the

644
00:34:06.051 --> 00:34:08.570
government.
You're 38% of your time,

645
00:34:08.571 --> 00:34:11.390
you are working for someone else and you never see the benefits of that.

646
00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:15.350
You think that those tax money that you've already paid taxes on it,

647
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:18.560
you get taxed again when you buy things in sales times.
Exactly.

648
00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:21.320
Oh and by the way,
when you want to leave your inheritance to your kids,

649
00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:25.520
you get that gets taxed by the way at 60 that you've already been taxed and your

650
00:34:25.521 --> 00:34:27.920
social security,
if you die before your social security,

651
00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:29.990
the government gets that money,
your family doesn't get that money.

652
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.890
So all that money you're putting away,

653
00:34:30.891 --> 00:34:33.860
you better live till you're 65 and then you get it in increments.

654
00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:36.410
So there are a lot of,
there are a lot of issues that that um,

655
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.640
but isn't this the main issue?
There's too many people.
That's the main issue.

656
00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:44.960
The main issue is this thing is gigantic and it's totally out of control.

657
00:34:44.961 --> 00:34:47.630
And one of the reasons why is that there's too many of us,

658
00:34:48.410 --> 00:34:49.730
people have been saying that for a long time.

659
00:34:49.731 --> 00:34:52.040
And I think that's certainly an issue and it's a,

660
00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.940
but I happen to believe that human beings with technology in their imagination

661
00:34:55.941 --> 00:34:59.870
will be able to accommodate the 9 billion people that are coming in the next 15

662
00:34:59.871 --> 00:35:02.780
years.
I mean,
I a billion more,
no,
a will be,

663
00:35:02.781 --> 00:35:06.680
it will be at 9 billion in about 15 years from,
from most projections.
In fact,

664
00:35:06.681 --> 00:35:11.000
most of the populations,
including the Middle East,
the mean age is 35 years old.

665
00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.630
So there are a lot of competent countries are actually have stable or negative

666
00:35:14.631 --> 00:35:19.580
population growth.
Um,
even in Africa they just did,
uh,
they just,
uh,

667
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:20.500
eh,

668
00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:25.040
these invest invest like Moody's or something said that Africa African bonds are

669
00:35:25.041 --> 00:35:29.300
actually worth investing in because huge swaths of Africa and now seeing the

670
00:35:29.301 --> 00:35:32.390
middleclass 360 million of them have cell phones.
What,
that,

671
00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:34.640
what comes with that is less children.

672
00:35:34.641 --> 00:35:36.890
Because as people move into cities and away from rural,

673
00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.840
they don't have as many children.
And so,

674
00:35:39.841 --> 00:35:44.310
so what's been surprising that nobody predicted in the 70s when you had things

675
00:35:44.311 --> 00:35:48.210
like the population bomb that was written and things is that population in a lot

676
00:35:48.211 --> 00:35:48.960
of countries,

677
00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.460
especially Europe and now more and more in the Middle East has actually started

678
00:35:53.461 --> 00:35:56.700
to stabilize and declined.
Germany has a zero population growth,

679
00:35:57.310 --> 00:36:02.130
zero zero Mexico,
Mexico,
which a lot of people think,
well that,
you know,

680
00:36:02.131 --> 00:36:04.350
they're exploding the population because they have a lot of children here.

681
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:09.150
Mexico now is down to,
I believe 2.6 children,

682
00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:14.070
a couple when it used to be literally,
you know,
eight nine.
So people,

683
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.970
people as they,
as they get access to information,
say I want more from me.

684
00:36:17.971 --> 00:36:21.420
Why do I want [inaudible]?
Friends are fucking crazy with kids.

685
00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:24.690
It's funny that that's like an insult somehow or another,
you know,

686
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.760
if you say something about Mexicans,
you know,

687
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:30.840
we'll just go like eight kids and I really,
oh,
what are you racist?
Like no,

688
00:36:30.841 --> 00:36:33.060
Mexicans have a lot of kids and kids are awesome.

689
00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:36.540
Why is it a bad thing to have a lot of kids too?
You know,
I love kids.

690
00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:40.200
I love having kids.
They're awesome.
Like if you got eight,
I'm not hating on you,

691
00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.140
but why is it funny that you know,
if you're Mexican,
you have kids,

692
00:36:43.141 --> 00:36:46.940
you say that and be like,
oh yeah,
asshole.
Yeah.
Well that as well.

693
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:51.450
No certain cultural,
certain cultural,
uh,
sort of Ma and things are,

694
00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:54.480
are very resilient.
It's like black people with chicken and watermelon.

695
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:59.010
Why is that bad?
Chicken and watermelon are both awesome.
Yeah,
no,
I love him.

696
00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:01.710
I love watermelon.
It's fucking delicious.
And I love chicken.

697
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.280
How come you can't bring up,
you know,
if you get a black waiter,

698
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.910
I'd like some chicken and watermelon that there'll be some tension.

699
00:37:08.911 --> 00:37:12.390
A lot of that comes back to,
you know,
in the,
in the,
in the fifties,
in the south,

700
00:37:12.391 --> 00:37:14.460
they would make posters of a black Joe,
you know,

701
00:37:14.461 --> 00:37:17.430
as far as I know where it all comes from,
but it's 2010.

702
00:37:17.431 --> 00:37:20.070
Why are we hanging on to that?
Yeah,
man,
chicken is awesome,
right?

703
00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.410
Fried chicken tastes awesome and watermelon tastes awesome.
Take all of those,

704
00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.860
take the power away.
The power away from chicken and watermelon.

705
00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:27.630
That's ridiculous.
I can't wait.
Did they combined the two?

706
00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:30.990
Although I'm not a fan of the grape soda.
Not really great.

707
00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:35.040
A great crushing of bottles.
You know what and said he has a joke where he,

708
00:37:35.041 --> 00:37:37.190
where he says that that brothers are,
um,

709
00:37:37.410 --> 00:37:39.390
the one thing that one place they're not cool.

710
00:37:39.391 --> 00:37:42.150
Like they're usually really way cooler than white people.
And he goes,

711
00:37:42.151 --> 00:37:42.901
and I heard,

712
00:37:42.901 --> 00:37:46.080
I was watched a bunch of black guys in the audience just die over this.
He goes,

713
00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:50.340
the one place you guys are not cool is when you,
when you see a magic trick,

714
00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:51.840
like when they see magically,
like

715
00:37:55.050 --> 00:37:57.750
they jump around,
they run out of the room and come back and stuff.

716
00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:02.240
It was so fun and it's is funny.
Oh God.
Yeah.
He's a good dude.
He's another good,

717
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:05.100
that's a really good guy.
Not like a comedian.
No.
Brett.

718
00:38:05.101 --> 00:38:08.940
Brett's in very normal dude.
He is.
That's the,
there's just,
there's not that many,

719
00:38:08.941 --> 00:38:11.850
there's more comics that are like,
that then are actors for sure.

720
00:38:11.851 --> 00:38:15.060
Comics are much more humbled by life.
You know,

721
00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.320
it's today it's much more difficult,
you know,
I'll have to be more grounded.

722
00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:21.600
Say about La.
When I first came,
you know,
I had been Mike Childhood,

723
00:38:21.601 --> 00:38:23.170
I'd grown up in the seven different countries.
You know,

724
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:25.800
I was born in the Philippines.
You had a really interesting life.

725
00:38:25.801 --> 00:38:27.480
I don't know how much of it you're allowed to talk about.

726
00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:32.630
We'll talk about your dad.
No,
no,
but no,
no,

727
00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:36.070
but I was,
I was,
I was bounced around many different countries.
I mean,

728
00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:40.870
I didn't live in the same place until I was,
uh,
15,
uh,
for,
for a year.
I mean,

729
00:38:40.871 --> 00:38:43.990
we've got,
I was Saudi Arabia,
Lebanon,
Pakistan creased India,

730
00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:47.560
the Philippines that will be constantly bounced around and then two and then me

731
00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:51.590
wet.
I know.
Thank you so much.
What the well,
I am,
I'm very mysterious.

732
00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:56.240
Little knows Brian was the other voice in,
um,
my,
uh,
getting pumped,
uh,

733
00:38:57.190 --> 00:39:00.370
audio clip,
if you've heard it,
like stern used to play it all the time.

734
00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:05.290
Like Mikey and this guy was in the basement.
Come on your ass looks awesome.

735
00:39:05.291 --> 00:39:09.370
Come on,
turn around and muscular.
We,
uh,
we did that.
It was,

736
00:39:09.371 --> 00:39:13.780
that was him and I though that was a over at a Warner brothers with Ginger Lynn

737
00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:18.710
[inaudible].
Yeah.
Yeah,
but you guys need to make a sequel to that.
I will.
I wrote,

738
00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.630
I wrote one where they wind up sucking each other off cause they shave each

739
00:39:22.631 --> 00:39:25.930
other's balls.
And I'm like,
you know,
I don't think my,

740
00:39:25.931 --> 00:39:29.110
I'm thinking about getting Dick Surgery like,
Oh,
do you get tick is awesome.

741
00:39:29.111 --> 00:39:30.790
It's huge.
You know what you need to do?

742
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:34.500
You need to shave your pubes like shave your pubes.
Yeah,
Shave your pubes me.

743
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:38.650
She can't check mine out.
Look at that.
It's all shaped.
My Dick looks way bigger.

744
00:39:38.651 --> 00:39:41.450
Right?
I don't remember what it used to look like.
Come on,

745
00:39:41.590 --> 00:39:44.530
let me see what your Boomi see.
We got there.
It pulls his pants down.

746
00:39:44.531 --> 00:39:46.070
He's got like all this pubes like,
oh,

747
00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:49.090
can I can't even see your tickets a fucking,
it's a forest in here.

748
00:39:49.091 --> 00:39:51.910
We've got to start trimming and then he trims it down.
It's like,
wow,

749
00:39:51.911 --> 00:39:56.320
that kind of tickles.
Look,
he could Cox huge now it doesn't,

750
00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.850
I swear to God,

751
00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.690
I think I would start gagging if I had that Dick in my mouth.

752
00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:07.900
And then they start face fucking each other and it's like really violent is

753
00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:14.050
in a straight away.
And this was a story that I wrote about on my blog.

754
00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.770
It's an absolute true story.
Um,

755
00:40:15.790 --> 00:40:20.770
a buddy of mine was a director of porno films and he invited us to a porno
party,

756
00:40:20.771 --> 00:40:24.190
me and a bunch of guys from Jujitsu.
So we get there and we're like,

757
00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:25.900
we were thinking,
well,
what is a porno party going to be like?

758
00:40:25.901 --> 00:40:27.830
It's all porno stars.
Like there's going to be a freak show,
right?
Yeah.

759
00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:30.850
We get their notes.
All dudes.
Okay.
It's all dudes and people who work for the,

760
00:40:30.940 --> 00:40:35.330
it's basically like the wrap party and a few girls show up.
Okay.
And uh,

761
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:40.660
that was the one we went to.
So hobbies,
things.
So they say,
so they say sit down,

762
00:40:40.661 --> 00:40:42.190
we're about to everybody please be seated.

763
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:44.200
We're about to start the movie and it's this movie,

764
00:40:44.201 --> 00:40:47.800
this like it's art porn and it's like real acting.

765
00:40:47.801 --> 00:40:51.700
And real plots with porn.
So it's death.
Okay.

766
00:40:51.730 --> 00:40:55.330
I mean the acting is the worst ever projecting it on the side of a building by

767
00:40:55.331 --> 00:41:00.130
the way,
really blurry.
So while all this is going on,
this one chick,

768
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:04.240
I won't even say her name,
she's getting fucking plowed on the screen.

769
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:07.390
This guy is just fucking her face.

770
00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.790
He's just got her mounted and I guess that's her thing.

771
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:14.080
And she likes to gag and shit.
So while this all was going on,
someone goes,

772
00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:14.973
she's here.

773
00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:21.330
So she pulls up and a guy gets out of the car and then she gets out of the car

774
00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:27.510
and the guy starts walking towards this screen with this look on his face.

775
00:41:27.581 --> 00:41:31.310
Like he cannot fucking believe what he's saying is their first shades.
This,

776
00:41:31.370 --> 00:41:34.130
this guy's going ass to mouth on her.
He's going ass

777
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:36.530
<v 2>mouth,
mouth and his,</v>

778
00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:39.260
every time we fuck her in the ass and be like this like hard,

779
00:41:39.261 --> 00:41:41.300
like you could hear his ball slapping off of her ass.

780
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:43.790
It was like the way I described like to chalkboard or racers.

781
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:47.150
So he's like fuck her ass.
And then our mouth when he's fucking her mouth.

782
00:41:47.151 --> 00:41:48.900
It's like she's an odd,
it's like,
oh,

783
00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:54.710
and this dude is just fucking fucking ass.
Fucking her mouth fucking ass.

784
00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:59.150
I mean it is brutal.
It's brutal.
Fuck spitting in her face.

785
00:41:59.151 --> 00:42:04.151
I mean it's fucking hard core and this kid is looking at this and his jaw is

786
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:08.960
totally dropped and I start like inching towards him.
I'm like,

787
00:42:08.961 --> 00:42:13.520
I want to know if this kid knows.
Does he know this can't be possible?
No idea.

788
00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:15.900
Had no idea.
There was that first day.
It was their first day.

789
00:42:15.901 --> 00:42:20.570
She told him that she was a makeup artist and she took him to a fucking porn.

790
00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:24.440
She didn't know they're going to be playing her life.
None on,
no,

791
00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:26.150
she did not on the side of a building.

792
00:42:26.151 --> 00:42:28.550
Somehow or another she thought he wasn't going to find out that she's a porno

793
00:42:28.551 --> 00:42:31.490
star.
So she goes,
I was going to tell you,

794
00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:35.960
that's exactly how she said it like this.
Oh,
it's going to tell you.
And,

795
00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.870
and then we grabbed the guy and we interviewed him and I took pictures of them

796
00:42:38.871 --> 00:42:40.740
and share what held it together.
Dude.

797
00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:45.230
The guy was wondering if remarkably I think,
you know,

798
00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.120
immediately the poor guy look,

799
00:42:47.121 --> 00:42:51.140
she was hot as fuck and the poor guy probably thought like,
wow,

800
00:42:51.141 --> 00:42:54.560
I got a real hottie that's fucked up that she didn't say anything.

801
00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:59.480
She's fucked up.
She's [inaudible].
Yeah.
But yeah,
no,
like just STDs alone.

802
00:42:59.870 --> 00:43:01.640
Tell somebody nothing happened.
I mean,

803
00:43:01.641 --> 00:43:03.230
she doesn't have any responsibility until they fuck.

804
00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:08.000
Maybe she wasn't going to get them.
Our Pal,
who I can't name,
um,
uh,

805
00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.580
had a,
a hot date with a porn star.

806
00:43:10.581 --> 00:43:15.170
He thought he got over to her place and um,
you know,
hey,

807
00:43:15.171 --> 00:43:18.700
you want to come over and smoke a little pot?
Sure.
So he goes over place,
um,

808
00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:21.770
smoked a little pot with her,
tries to bust a move and she's like,
no,
no,
no.

809
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:24.290
I just want us to be smoking buddies.

810
00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:31.060
And so I get you for your amazing conversation.
Oh,

811
00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.720
that's the worst ever.
It was going to be your smoking budget right there.

812
00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:37.970
And that must be,
this must have been very similar to how this,
well,

813
00:43:37.971 --> 00:43:41.420
this guy must have felt a lot worse,
but he probably felt like got this hot girl.

814
00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:46.100
She's super hot.
I'm going to go to her party at work.
Fuck it.
She's so hot.

815
00:43:46.101 --> 00:43:49.200
Look at her body.
My God.
And then he gets out of the car.
Well,

816
00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:57.050
you're trying to show me you're a good girl now.
Fuck.

817
00:43:57.290 --> 00:44:00.980
It's like you were so close.
Know.
Fuck.
And I'm the one guy.
You don't fuck.

818
00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:04.220
I'm the one guy to you.
Bang Stranger.
She's hot as fuck.

819
00:44:04.221 --> 00:44:07.480
He's beaten off to all the time waiting for this.
Oh yeah.

820
00:44:07.490 --> 00:44:09.420
I'm going to have this pot date.
We're going to hang out with

821
00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:15.650
kiss overplays Tara.
Sorry.
I just want to be smoking buddy.
That's awful.

822
00:44:15.651 --> 00:44:17.330
Sorry.
Sorry.

823
00:44:17.331 --> 00:44:22.250
Tired of sex or this little tiny skirt throw you off and these 10 inch heels.

824
00:44:22.251 --> 00:44:25.460
Did she really think that I was going to fuck you?
Oh my God,
that makes me,

825
00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:28.340
Oh my God.
I'm not like,
that makes me angry.
He's a,

826
00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:31.980
if you're a woman and you do porn,
you have to make it really clear

827
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.390
<v 1>with dudes.
The can't fuck you.
Yeah.
Oh,
by the way,
you can't fuck me.
Yeah.</v>

828
00:44:36.391 --> 00:44:38.250
You know,
you can't just ask.
Never going to work either.

829
00:44:38.251 --> 00:44:42.750
Come on over my house and smoked some weed at night.
Oh,
okay.
You figure.
Yeah.

830
00:44:42.751 --> 00:44:44.960
What's going to happen there?
You want a massage?
Yeah.
Fuck yeah.

831
00:44:44.961 --> 00:44:47.250
We'll stop off and pick up some condoms.
Oh,

832
00:44:47.251 --> 00:44:50.240
squirt and lotion on her back and the finger.
My asshole.

833
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:54.930
What finger you asshole.
I just want to be smoking buddies.

834
00:44:55.710 --> 00:45:00.080
Who's alarm clock went off?
Why heels write him up.

835
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:04.890
I gotta go to work and this is like a real porn girl guy.
Porn Star.
Oh fuck yes.

836
00:45:04.891 --> 00:45:09.360
I don't remember who it is.
Oh Gee.
She's a fucking,
she's a of talented performer.

837
00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:13.860
Yeah.
High heels and Liz shitting in my favorite shit.
Why?

838
00:45:13.861 --> 00:45:17.700
The guys always want a straight guys always pretend they're like a joke around

839
00:45:17.701 --> 00:45:20.070
in a gay way.
It's so funny.
That's a gross thing.

840
00:45:20.071 --> 00:45:23.250
And my Buddy Chris Delea sends me pictures sometimes.
It's funny.
Yeah.
You know,

841
00:45:23.251 --> 00:45:26.820
Christa,
Leah,
right.
Crystally awareness as a young comic.
Really Funny Guy.

842
00:45:26.821 --> 00:45:29.790
And I'll get pictures on my cell phone and it'll just be,
hey,

843
00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:30.710
a picture of his legs,

844
00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:35.340
his stonewashed jeans with kind of like just the bowl to of his pants and has to

845
00:45:35.341 --> 00:45:38.760
be a close up shot.
He's,
you know,
just be like,
keep up the good work,
Brian.

846
00:45:38.761 --> 00:45:43.350
Just some innocuous or then I got a picture the other day on my phone and he's

847
00:45:43.351 --> 00:45:48.350
got his heart on wrapped in a sheet is holding them on a sheet like that and,

848
00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:52.170
and,
and,
and,
and the caption says,
dude,
there's a ghost in my room.

849
00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.670
<v 3>Oh,
fuck yeah.</v>

850
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.090
<v 1>Okay,
I'm glad we put that in the podcast.
Some of these to put that in the movie.</v>

851
00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:04.610
Oh,
it was the funniest thing in the world.

852
00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:09.420
Pay Him or put him in the movie and have him show up.
And he's like,
hey.

853
00:46:09.421 --> 00:46:13.140
And he's got his phone.
I walk into his phone and that's him holding his dog.

854
00:46:13.141 --> 00:46:17.280
He's got a little fluffy white dog with glasses on and half a heart on standing

855
00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:21.030
arching his chest like that with his dog.
I went,
oh,
what are you doing?

856
00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:24.390
And then he walked by me as I was talking to take his phone and rub it across my

857
00:46:24.391 --> 00:46:29.100
face.
I was like,
ah,
this is a strange thing.
Oh,

858
00:46:29.101 --> 00:46:31.800
that's hilarious.
If it wasn't for gay people,

859
00:46:31.801 --> 00:46:34.530
we would be missing a big chunk of the phone in our culture.

860
00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:37.980
Absolutely Elton John's style sunglasses,
and they search the trends.

861
00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:41.520
Let's start the fashion trends,
man.
You guys about Dad's gay.

862
00:46:41.521 --> 00:46:43.700
And then four years later they're like,
where are they?

863
00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:46.010
What's really funny is like,
Gee,

864
00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:49.110
you know Rob Halford is like the originator of all that,

865
00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:52.590
like leather fucking dominatrix type shit.

866
00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:55.560
You know the way he dresses on stage and he was gay,

867
00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:58.970
he was gay and he got all these people to dress like him.
It's fantastic.
I mean,

868
00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:01.530
how many people dressed the way they dressed?
You know,

869
00:47:01.531 --> 00:47:04.860
they wanted to be like rockers because of Rob Halford from Judas priest.
Yeah,

870
00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:07.900
fucking a lot of them.
He was gay.
He was gay.
Gay as fuck.

871
00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:12.810
So was Pete Townsend Townsend?
It did a lot of shit.
Pete Townsend I guess is,

872
00:47:12.811 --> 00:47:14.900
I don't know if he's gay or ed did a lot of gay shit.

873
00:47:14.901 --> 00:47:17.370
He said he knows what it's like to be a woman.
Yeah.
He said,
yeah,
I know.

874
00:47:17.370 --> 00:47:21.000
And I remember Roger Daltrey heard that.
Yeah.
And Roger Daltrey was like,
ah,

875
00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:26.850
ah,
ah.
That's how I thought we weren't talking about this.
I,

876
00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:30.850
uh,
Pete Townsend fucked a couple of guys who got fucked.

877
00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:34.000
I Bet Daltrey tried it too.
I bet they all did it.
I mean,
look,

878
00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:37.300
there's always that college stuff flies out of his speedo.

879
00:47:37.301 --> 00:47:42.280
All of a sudden I'm gay.
They get raped on Oz.
I didn't,
I did not.

880
00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:45.850
I wasn't my plenty off story that we probably can't tell.
Yeah.
Story.

881
00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:49.270
That was probably,
that was a weird situation while you were there.

882
00:47:49.271 --> 00:47:53.290
So you saw it and I got vindicated in the end.
Of course you did.
Yeah.
And I do.

883
00:47:53.291 --> 00:47:55.990
I was like,
here's a situation that happened.
Um,

884
00:47:56.050 --> 00:47:58.440
Brian had a friend and the friend,
uh,

885
00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:02.160
had a lady friend that happened to be an exotic dancer.
Okay.

886
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:04.630
And we went to,
told me to go,

887
00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:08.950
he told him to go to visit her at her place of employment.

888
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:11.730
And you saw the girl may called the B line for me and stuff,
dancing,

889
00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.690
not just dancing.
She was,

890
00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:18.960
she hopped on top of Brian and immediately straddled her vagina ont his deck and

891
00:48:19.361 --> 00:48:21.760
started gyrating her pussy.
And you're saying,

892
00:48:21.761 --> 00:48:23.290
you're saying this girl wants a bangle?
I go,
I know,

893
00:48:23.291 --> 00:48:25.600
but I don't have clearance from my friend yet.
I don't know if it's allowed,

894
00:48:25.601 --> 00:48:29.110
but I think it's insinuated,
but I still wasn't going to do it because you can't.

895
00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:32.050
It was ridiculous.
So,
um,
you know,

896
00:48:32.051 --> 00:48:34.810
I think you asked me to go with you when you dropped her off.

897
00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:38.830
She felt uncomfortable.
Yes,
I want you to come because you got a headache.

898
00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:40.690
Come out of here.
I was like,
dude,
you come with me because I'm,

899
00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:43.720
this is bad because she's going to give me a ride and it's my girls,

900
00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:46.870
my boys girl.
And it just doesn't look good.

901
00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:52.150
So I don't know if he turned into the wolf man after I left.
No,
no,

902
00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:56.540
I was at the shareholders.
But can you say what she accused you of?
Yeah.
Uh,

903
00:48:56.710 --> 00:49:00.190
she accused me of making,
like getting rough with her.
Actually I found out later,

904
00:49:00.191 --> 00:49:02.950
I didn't even know that was an acquisition shit that I actually got physical

905
00:49:02.951 --> 00:49:05.260
with her and tried to,
you know,
make her,

906
00:49:05.261 --> 00:49:08.140
have a kiss me and fool around with her and stuff like that,

907
00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:11.590
which is kind of like saying the guy tried to rape me,
you know what I mean?

908
00:49:11.950 --> 00:49:14.800
At least when people hear that they go,
the guy's a closet rapist.

909
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:18.640
But what happened was,
uh,
it was the Hilton or the Sheridan and um,

910
00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:22.930
I was on the third floor,
which actually means that the lobby,
it's on the lobby,

911
00:49:22.931 --> 00:49:26.440
the third floor.
And so,
um,
I said,
she said,
let me use your bathroom.

912
00:49:26.441 --> 00:49:27.640
When she dropped me off,
she goes,

913
00:49:27.641 --> 00:49:30.430
I need to use your bathroom instead of using the bathroom in the lobby.

914
00:49:30.431 --> 00:49:34.510
I need to use your bathroom.
And we'd go to my room and I go,
I'm dead.

915
00:49:34.630 --> 00:49:38.620
She's in my room now.
This is bad.
And by the way,
I'm an animal.
I'm not,

916
00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.670
I'm not saying I'm not a good guy.
I mean I,
I,
it's like I'm a 12 stepper.
I mean,

917
00:49:42.671 --> 00:49:44.830
you've got to grow in my high and my,
and my hotel.

918
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:49.720
I dance on me all night and nobody's watching danger.
Yeah.
And by the way,

919
00:49:49.721 --> 00:49:52.090
even if I do full around with my friend better,

920
00:49:52.091 --> 00:49:54.850
forgive me because I'm just a guy.
If he's like me,
right,

921
00:49:55.210 --> 00:49:57.980
he shouldn't be attached to her anyway.
She's Koresh you doing what's correct.

922
00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:02.350
Correct.
But,
but I,
I thought maybe that would have been you were thinking like,

923
00:50:02.351 --> 00:50:05.310
I think he might want me to fuck her.
Why else would it be to me?

924
00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:08.950
But she's this crazy.
Exactly.
But you know,
then she's in my room and I go,

925
00:50:08.951 --> 00:50:13.330
I start acting.
I started doing,
I got nervous.
So I started acting silly.
I was,

926
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:17.320
I was joking around and she could tell because she wanted some wine.

927
00:50:17.321 --> 00:50:20.200
So do you have any wine?
And my mini bar and I poured the one,
I go,

928
00:50:20.201 --> 00:50:23.350
this is how it's going to start.
This is getting bad.
I'm already guilty.
I'm done.

929
00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:27.680
I'm already guilty.
So I start,
she goes,
a,
you're a freak,
aren't you?

930
00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:29.600
You're a freak or something like that.
And I go,
yeah,

931
00:50:29.601 --> 00:50:31.780
I'm a freak and I start doing this.
And I said,
I thought out,

932
00:50:32.030 --> 00:50:36.090
I'm a freak and she can see that I'm nervous.
And she goes,

933
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:39.630
are you going to go back and tell such and such that I was in your room?

934
00:50:40.530 --> 00:50:45.460
And I go,
no,
no,
I'm not.
Actually,
I'm not at all.
In fact,
here's my last 20 bucks.

935
00:50:45.461 --> 00:50:48.150
So I spent all my money on you,
which was really inappropriate anyway.

936
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:50.070
And I remember was 20 bucks.

937
00:50:50.071 --> 00:50:53.430
I go give this to the valet and we'll just say that you dropped me off.

938
00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:57.110
That would be way better for me because this is already bad.
Sorry.

939
00:50:57.130 --> 00:51:01.890
That situation she gets up,
goes out.
And,
uh,

940
00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:05.460
the next day,
or I guess that weekend I'd booked that CBS show,

941
00:51:05.461 --> 00:51:09.570
but I go back to Oz and,
uh,
I literally,
nobody will look at me.

942
00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:13.650
And then I got written out and the that,
and I was,

943
00:51:13.710 --> 00:51:18.670
I was the person that this happened.
It was a huge scene.
He tried to,
he was like,

944
00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:21.670
the girl told him and he was like,
you know,
he didn't know.

945
00:51:21.671 --> 00:51:24.160
He thought this guy put up with me.
She was crying.
Well,

946
00:51:24.161 --> 00:51:27.490
she didn't want was what she did.
Why was that?
She came back to your room.

947
00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:31.510
She had a 12 year old child.
She had a meal ticket and all of a sudden,

948
00:51:31.511 --> 00:51:33.940
because she makes this mistake,
she had to sell somebody down.

949
00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:36.190
Somebody going down the river,
not her daughter.
It's going to be me.
Right.

950
00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:38.950
And so I never held any,
I honestly never held any resentment.

951
00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:42.550
I put myself in that position.
I was responsible for it.
I paid a price.

952
00:51:42.551 --> 00:51:46.720
By the way,
I've got rich off to some show.
Just can't help but be crazy.
You know,

953
00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:49.740
it's very unfortunate.
And when you're talking about a girl who's a,
you know,

954
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:52.960
exotic dancer,
La probably on drugs,

955
00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:57.490
I mean a good person or she had a 12 year old daughter that that was,
she went,

956
00:51:57.491 --> 00:52:00.040
wow,
I got this chance to be with this guy who could be a star.

957
00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:04.870
And I just screwed that up.
Uh,
and I might've just screwed that up and,
and uh,

958
00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:08.130
you know,
I've got to silence my phone.
I'm sorry.
I thought I did.
Um,

959
00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:09.530
so I just never,
uh,

960
00:52:09.540 --> 00:52:14.540
and we reconcile me and the guy runs out when he found out the truth and it was

961
00:52:14.661 --> 00:52:19.190
fine.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I saw him like right after it happened.

962
00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:22.250
I know.
Thank God.
What a mess.
The whole thing,

963
00:52:22.251 --> 00:52:25.070
which is such a mess in a bad situation.
I felt,

964
00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:30.130
I felt almost a little bit guilty that I had left her alone with you.

965
00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:35.090
Yeah.
Cause I,
I,
you know,
I knew that creeped out.
Yeah.
I was long ass time ago.

966
00:52:35.390 --> 00:52:39.050
You were really creeped out and I was like,
you're going to be right.
Yeah,
mark.

967
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:40.900
Okay,
fine.
Right.

968
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:44.630
And so I left remember that so well I remember you saying I have and I go,

969
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:47.420
I go just drive,
drive with us,
you know,
and you're like,
I can't do that.

970
00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:51.690
I'm going home.
I remember that so well.
Yeah,
I just remember the one,

971
00:52:51.710 --> 00:52:53.350
it was all going down like when we were at the club level,

972
00:52:53.390 --> 00:52:57.550
like this is nothing but trouble.
It's this is a track mare.
Like what?
It's going.

973
00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:00.320
First of all,
she wasn't even attractive.
Okay.
No she was not.

974
00:53:00.321 --> 00:53:02.630
I mean I'm not bullshitting.
She was an unattractive girl.

975
00:53:02.631 --> 00:53:05.390
She did not have a good body.
She did not have a good face.

976
00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:07.230
And if you were going to go get dances,

977
00:53:07.231 --> 00:53:10.310
there was a bunch of really attractive girls there and you probably would have

978
00:53:10.311 --> 00:53:12.650
picked someone else if that's what you were there for.

979
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:16.940
So it was like she worked you for money anyway because you got in there and she

980
00:53:16.941 --> 00:53:20.650
climbed on top of like she did.
She did.
She did work cause she,
she,

981
00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:23.630
she kept saying,
you want another dance and you kept peeling off money.

982
00:53:23.631 --> 00:53:25.980
I remember,
oh,
remember I told you to sit next to me so it didn't

983
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.970
<v 2>look like [inaudible],
dude,
you got to sit next to me cause I,
I don't want,</v>

984
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:32.180
you know,
she's dancing on me the whole time.
Listen,
God,

985
00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:35.400
you would dance from another girl to get her off your lap.

986
00:53:35.610 --> 00:53:39.700
I paid a pretty girl to go over and dance with him.
But when you're with now,

987
00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:41.760
now as you get older,
the,
you know what you do,

988
00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:44.640
you get up and leave or you don't go there in the first place.

989
00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:47.730
But when you're young,
we're such idiots.
We were such idiots.

990
00:53:47.770 --> 00:53:49.190
But we were retarded,

991
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:52.770
but sane enough to know that this was a giant monster problem.
Yeah.

992
00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:56.700
That was just one step along the way of me realizing like that,

993
00:53:56.701 --> 00:54:01.260
like crazy girls aren't really fun.
I used to think crazy.
I remember me,
dude,

994
00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:04.860
I was the king of that to no one,
no one,
Joe Smith,

995
00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:08.010
Joe would sniff it out so fast.
He'd go,
he,

996
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:12.630
I'd be in this girl and I mean dating her.
He goes,
she's crazy.
I go,
no,
no,
no,
no.

997
00:54:12.631 --> 00:54:16.980
She's a good girl.
No dude,
she's crazy.
You need to run now.
Nah,

998
00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:21.090
I'm not going to listen to Joe.
Six months later pregnant.
What?
My House,

999
00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:25.920
I've got a,
uh,
an unusual ability to spot people who are off.

1000
00:54:26.310 --> 00:54:29.760
There's a smell that they have.
There's a way that they communicate with me.

1001
00:54:29.761 --> 00:54:30.660
I don't know what it is.

1002
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:34.860
Maybe it's because I'm a little aggressive and even though I'm really nice and

1003
00:54:34.861 --> 00:54:35.430
friendly,

1004
00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:38.710
there's something about me that just puts people on a little bit of an edge.

1005
00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:41.610
Say it looked like it could be a Douche bag.
You saved me because of that.

1006
00:54:41.611 --> 00:54:45.000
But because of that,
like,
because I have this weird thing about me,

1007
00:54:45.001 --> 00:54:48.750
sometimes people get a little uneasy and when people get a little uneasy just

1008
00:54:48.751 --> 00:54:51.840
for a second,
they reveal who they really are.
They just,

1009
00:54:51.841 --> 00:54:54.930
there's just something about people when they know you're looking at them,

1010
00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.100
they know you're paying attention to them.

1011
00:54:56.101 --> 00:54:58.890
It's like when you're going on stage and you're bombing on stage,
you know that,

1012
00:54:58.891 --> 00:55:03.180
that hyper sensitive feeling that you have of being judged and watched and

1013
00:55:03.181 --> 00:55:04.830
you're,
you're falling short.
Well,

1014
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:07.350
when people are crazy and you look at them funny,
you know,

1015
00:55:07.351 --> 00:55:10.290
and you and you try it,
they'll just show it to you.
That's very just like,

1016
00:55:10.291 --> 00:55:11.124
I'm crazy.

1017
00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:14.910
<v 4>Sometimes it to me,
I may creeps me out like,
all right,
this guy's gonna rate me.</v>

1018
00:55:14.911 --> 00:55:17.100
He's [inaudible].
You know,

1019
00:55:17.101 --> 00:55:22.101
it's not [inaudible] on snap crazy

1020
00:55:23.890 --> 00:55:27.820
<v 2>people.
You have to allow them to pretend that they're normal.</v>

1021
00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:30.670
You have to allow them,
you give them time,
you know,
you let them,

1022
00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:33.250
you have a conversation with them.
Things get rolling and you go,
well,

1023
00:55:33.251 --> 00:55:35.320
I'm just going to let this guy get away with this.
All Right Bob.
Well,

1024
00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:39.430
very nice meeting you and joy indeed.
You know,
and you know,

1025
00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:42.160
but if you don't do that,
if you're like,
why you talking to me like that?

1026
00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:45.340
Like what's going on here?
Are you,
are you crazy?
Like what's going on here?
Right.

1027
00:55:45.490 --> 00:55:47.170
But if you expose that right away,

1028
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:50.680
then all that crazy juice comes flying out of them because you've always been so

1029
00:55:50.681 --> 00:55:55.630
good at that,
man.
You nailed his,
how many?
I nailed one.

1030
00:55:55.631 --> 00:55:59.710
Would you say?
[inaudible].
Yeah,
you saved my life though with that.

1031
00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:00.730
I got,

1032
00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:04.810
I was going to get married because somebody got pregnant and you literally were

1033
00:56:04.811 --> 00:56:08.240
on the phone going,
I'm losing you man.
I'm losing you.
You're,
you're,
you're,

1034
00:56:08.241 --> 00:56:11.230
you're,
you're,
you're talking yourself into it.
I know you.

1035
00:56:11.350 --> 00:56:13.350
This is not the girl you wanna spend the rest of your life with you.

1036
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:14.171
I'm losing you.

1037
00:56:14.171 --> 00:56:18.280
I'm an eye and I compared it to patty because his ex girlfriends was like super

1038
00:56:18.281 --> 00:56:22.390
cool,
super intelligent,
like really fun to be around.
And this girl was just,

1039
00:56:22.391 --> 00:56:24.940
does Zombie a mess?
It was just,

1040
00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:29.420
it was all bad energy and fucking just,
Oh,
that end.

1041
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:31.870
And then he was like telling me that this is ed.
He's going to settle down.

1042
00:56:31.871 --> 00:56:32.531
I'm like,
whoa.

1043
00:56:32.531 --> 00:56:36.100
You know how many kid is one thing that's not in your control but you cannot

1044
00:56:36.101 --> 00:56:39.930
fucking marry this chick,
but you should run away from her a long time ago.

1045
00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:44.590
And she was the best thing.
Best thing I ever did.
I was around so many of them.

1046
00:56:44.591 --> 00:56:47.570
I got to smell them.
I got to know what the hell.
Come on,
man.

1047
00:56:47.571 --> 00:56:49.710
It's the one place I never got used to.
I was going to say I lived overseas.

1048
00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:52.180
The point of that was I never,
I,
I can get used to anything.

1049
00:56:52.181 --> 00:56:55.600
La is the one place actually never really got used to because you ran into so

1050
00:56:55.601 --> 00:56:59.620
many crazy people.
Yeah.
And people who live in the rest of the country,

1051
00:56:59.621 --> 00:57:02.620
I don't think you really can understand how nutty it is.

1052
00:57:02.621 --> 00:57:06.640
Just think of this place and there's this place where everyone gravitates to

1053
00:57:06.641 --> 00:57:11.020
that has a deficit,
like really needs an incredible amount of attention.

1054
00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:13.240
And we're both guilty of it,
you know?
I mean,
look,

1055
00:57:13.241 --> 00:57:15.100
there's only one way you become a comedian.

1056
00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:17.650
You have to have a fucked up childhood where you're not loved enough.

1057
00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:20.050
It's just this fact,
you know,
my freaks,

1058
00:57:20.051 --> 00:57:22.990
my mom out and I want to say that and it's not her.
And you know,

1059
00:57:22.991 --> 00:57:25.450
she did her best,
but my parents were divorced and you know,

1060
00:57:25.451 --> 00:57:26.740
I don't know my dad and there's just,

1061
00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:28.690
and you've got your issues and I've got my issues.

1062
00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:33.460
And all actors have their issues,
all of them to hold.
No other reason.

1063
00:57:33.570 --> 00:57:36.250
And there's a few people like you know,
it was cool that dude from Vegas,

1064
00:57:36.251 --> 00:57:38.250
Josh do is and he's a good guy.

1065
00:57:38.251 --> 00:57:41.620
I worked in coolest shit like regular down to earth.

1066
00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:43.810
There's a bunch of it like that Mario Lopez is like that.

1067
00:57:43.811 --> 00:57:48.760
Just regular normal down there do very cool.
But most people know,

1068
00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:49.810
most people are,

1069
00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:53.080
they have this giant hole and that's how they've made it to the top of the heap

1070
00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:57.550
because their whole is so needy that to just stuffing things into to it all the

1071
00:57:57.551 --> 00:58:00.040
time to try to stay famous.
Yeah.
I mean it's just,

1072
00:58:00.041 --> 00:58:04.250
it's a mad sickness and an obsession.
And here's this one place on the,

1073
00:58:04.251 --> 00:58:08.650
on the map where everyone gravitates to,
to try to be the next,

1074
00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:11.910
that guy they want to be Tom cruise or you know any and there's the,

1075
00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:15.280
they outnumber everyone else.
And even if you get like out here where I live,

1076
00:58:15.281 --> 00:58:19.210
like out deep into the burbs,
you,
you find them like the ones that have given up,

1077
00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:23.140
you know,
they all have aspirations.
You know,
there's wives down the street here.

1078
00:58:23.141 --> 00:58:27.310
They want to be on the real housewives of,
of fucking Calabasas or some shit.

1079
00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:29.950
You know,
I mean there's,
there's,
there's,
there's all of them.

1080
00:58:29.951 --> 00:58:33.270
They wanted to be a singer.
It didn't work out.
There's so many of them.

1081
00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.840
It's like my buddy was like,
my buddy was like,

1082
00:58:34.841 --> 00:58:39.370
why does my dentist have a screenplay
or a headshot,

1083
00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:41.410
a headshot.
Really,
Jesus,

1084
00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:44.680
you dig a little bit and you find out everybody came out here and that's why you

1085
00:58:44.681 --> 00:58:48.970
sit through traffic and how many people try to get you to read their shit and

1086
00:58:48.971 --> 00:58:53.020
how,
and we just had a situation.
Well,
dude,
I've had so many situations,

1087
00:58:53.021 --> 00:58:55.930
but guys who tried to get me to produce their shit,
like I have this,
uh,

1088
00:58:55.931 --> 00:58:58.570
this idea,
I just want to produce a pilot.
Do you think you can help me?

1089
00:58:58.571 --> 00:59:02.560
Like what are you talking about man?
I deal with it every single day.

1090
00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:06.460
Everybody favors,
everyone has favors too.
They're like,
I need help.

1091
00:59:06.461 --> 00:59:09.370
Can you fill this out dish for me or do this for that?

1092
00:59:09.371 --> 00:59:12.910
Can you help me get in the comedy?
And Magic Club.
I don't even know you do.

1093
00:59:12.911 --> 00:59:17.250
Can I open for you on the road?
It's like it's,
it's constant and and needy.

1094
00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:19.120
[inaudible]

1095
00:59:19.570 --> 00:59:23.390
did you ever email someone and ask them if you can open for them?
No.

1096
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:26.300
Especially when you were an open Mike or I've had like open miker is that asked,

1097
00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:29.900
this is one kid who from England and he sends me this thing.

1098
00:59:29.901 --> 00:59:32.960
He says he's like one of the youngest headliners ever in England and he wants to

1099
00:59:32.961 --> 00:59:34.850
a co headline with me,
you know,

1100
00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:37.880
next time I do a gig up there and he's worked with this guy and that guy is

1101
00:59:37.881 --> 00:59:41.630
coming to America soon.
I'm like,
what the fuck are you talking?
I need you.
Yeah.

1102
00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:44.550
You know what?
That's exactly what my show is missing.
I need a co headline.

1103
00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:47.930
Those headlines or she would just side that you would attach yourself to someone

1104
00:59:47.931 --> 00:59:50.780
else's show because I couldn't even imagine thinking like that.

1105
00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.310
Like if someone was playing in town,

1106
00:59:52.311 --> 00:59:54.740
like say if when I was first starting out of,
you know,

1107
00:59:54.741 --> 00:59:58.310
Bill Hicks was coming into town,
would that last one when I was an open Miker,

1108
00:59:58.430 --> 00:59:59.870
you know,
the idea that would call up,
hey,

1109
00:59:59.871 --> 01:00:03.950
can I get seven minutes on Bill Hicks or should look like what?
Well,

1110
01:00:03.951 --> 01:00:07.940
I think it's a question that a lot of kids need that constant need and they

1111
01:00:07.941 --> 01:00:10.370
don't understand.
You've got to earn things and it takes time,
you know?
Yeah.

1112
01:00:10.450 --> 01:00:13.120
Well there's plenty of places to get on stage.
The time to get on stages,

1113
01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.190
not during a professional show and storing all those bringer shows and you know,

1114
01:00:16.191 --> 01:00:19.040
and then you eventually put together an act and then people put you on your show

1115
01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:21.770
because they want you on the show.
You don't,
you don't go like,

1116
01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.080
so listening for it on,

1117
01:00:23.081 --> 01:00:26.510
on other people's shows is also one of the strange things like acting,

1118
01:00:26.511 --> 01:00:29.080
but especially stand up where,
you know,
if you can be an actor,
it's like you can,

1119
01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:31.220
you can be an actor and get away with it sometimes.
Like you can,

1120
01:00:31.460 --> 01:00:35.390
you can be a good look in 22 year old and get a show and actually make a lot of

1121
01:00:35.391 --> 01:00:37.890
money for five years.
And then that parlays no another show.

1122
01:00:37.891 --> 01:00:38.481
And before you know it,

1123
01:00:38.481 --> 01:00:41.420
you've got like a big house and millions of dollars because you know,
if you're,

1124
01:00:41.421 --> 01:00:44.580
if somewhat emotionally available and you know,
but um,
uh,

1125
01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:48.530
stand up is one thing you cannot fake and don't tell me you want to get into it

1126
01:00:48.531 --> 01:00:50.770
when you're 38,
it's just going to be a waste of your time.

1127
01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:53.810
You're not going to be willing to do the things that you have to do in order to

1128
01:00:53.811 --> 01:00:54.980
get good at it.
You have to,

1129
01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:57.410
you have to live it and you have to be there every night.

1130
01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.000
You have to perform everywhere.

1131
01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:02.540
You've got to do coffee shops and shit holes and dive bars.

1132
01:01:02.541 --> 01:01:06.210
Only way in is through and,
and you know,
it's also a rhythm.
Like I,

1133
01:01:06.211 --> 01:01:08.770
I'd never tried,
I never take,
like people asked me,
how come I,

1134
01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:13.130
I perform every week?
Well,
because if I take too much time off,
I lose my rhythm.

1135
01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:16.710
Yeah.
Like,
it's,
it's like a song in a way,
you know,
and you,

1136
01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:19.160
if you're not thinking about it,
you're not writing new stuff either.

1137
01:01:19.161 --> 01:01:21.680
You gotta come,
you gotta constantly be,
it's constantly alive.

1138
01:01:21.681 --> 01:01:23.600
You have to keep it alive.
If I don't perform every week,

1139
01:01:23.601 --> 01:01:26.270
like I'll go sometimes where I'll take a couple of weeks off and then I do a

1140
01:01:26.271 --> 01:01:28.820
show.
I always feel,
I always feel like a little off,

1141
01:01:30.110 --> 01:01:34.730
but then when you do like a weekend,
a long weekend,
somewhere like Thursday,

1142
01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:36.470
Friday,
Saturday,
you know,
by the time Sunday rolls around,

1143
01:01:36.471 --> 01:01:39.620
you're just a juggernaut.
Yeah.
I liken it to sort of,
um,

1144
01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.540
I was in Canada and it was a Sunday.

1145
01:01:41.541 --> 01:01:43.780
I had one of the best shows I've ever had and I,
I like into it.

1146
01:01:43.790 --> 01:01:47.730
I cut this feeling,
I got this kind of like,
like a kind of,
I felt like,
uh,

1147
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:51.080
this warm kind of cloudy feeling and I knew I didn't have to really do anything.

1148
01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:56.000
Like everything kind of took over.
I feel that way.
Right?
Yeah.
You're writing it.

1149
01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:59.160
I'm coming up with jokes.
They,
they're coming to me on stage.

1150
01:01:59.690 --> 01:02:02.840
It's like that flow that it's the greatest feeling,

1151
01:02:02.841 --> 01:02:07.430
that wax will that tuning in to.
I mean that's really channeling,
right?

1152
01:02:07.431 --> 01:02:09.050
It's like you're channeling,
I always say that,

1153
01:02:09.051 --> 01:02:12.980
and I described this on stage this way,
that when I'm at my best,

1154
01:02:13.010 --> 01:02:17.450
it's like I'm a passenger.
It's like I'm riding it.
And did you,
did you,

1155
01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.080
there's a great story about this.
The who won the fields,
medal

1156
01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.690
<v 1>and mathematics.
He was that guy.
He,</v>

1157
01:02:21.691 --> 01:02:25.830
he figured out a math equation they'd been trying to figure out since 1806 and

1158
01:02:25.831 --> 01:02:30.300
the answer was 357 pages long or something like that.
Gives you an idea.

1159
01:02:30.301 --> 01:02:32.250
So he went to the metal and mathematics,
which is,

1160
01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:36.090
which is worth $1 million and it's the Nobel prize for math.

1161
01:02:36.091 --> 01:02:38.850
Basically it's the fields medal,
right?
It's the most prestigious thing.

1162
01:02:38.851 --> 01:02:42.090
So this genius,
he's the Siberian guy.
If aliens heard about this guy,

1163
01:02:42.091 --> 01:02:44.160
he doesn't take the money.
Yeah.
He just said,
boy,
he disappeared.

1164
01:02:44.161 --> 01:02:46.320
He went and they found them in his and his aunts,

1165
01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:50.190
like Shaq fishing shack like a year later.
And they were like,
you know,

1166
01:02:50.191 --> 01:02:53.550
BBC was like,
look you,
you won this,
this,
you know,
fields metal.

1167
01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:58.050
Why didn't you take it?
And he said,
well,
you guys are worshiping the wrong thing.

1168
01:02:58.051 --> 01:03:00.210
You should be worshiping.
It's like worshiping the radio,

1169
01:03:00.211 --> 01:03:02.880
the receiver instead of the actual music.
He goes,

1170
01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.830
the answer is always been in the template in the sky.

1171
01:03:04.831 --> 01:03:08.340
I just happen to have a certain frequency and wiring that was able to channel it

1172
01:03:08.341 --> 01:03:12.960
through my body.
Don't,
don't,
don't worship me for being wired a certain way.

1173
01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:16.380
I just channeled it,
will show the actual equation.
I went,

1174
01:03:16.381 --> 01:03:18.710
you know what that said?
Great way of looking at everything.

1175
01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:21.820
<v 2>That's all it was.
A lot of artists believe,
you know,</v>

1176
01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:25.780
a lot of people call it the Muse and they've called it that for thousands of

1177
01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:29.410
years.
That,
you know,
something comes to you and gives you these ideas.
You know,

1178
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:32.770
like the story you're gonna write already exist in the war of art.

1179
01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:35.230
Is that Pressfield,
Steven Pressfield,
Pressfield book,

1180
01:03:35.231 --> 01:03:39.200
great book for creative people who are into,
you know,
uh,

1181
01:03:39.250 --> 01:03:42.400
like something that gives you like inspiration to write and work.

1182
01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:44.320
It's a really good,
it's called the war for art.

1183
01:03:44.321 --> 01:03:46.540
And he talks more of our talks about,
talk about,

1184
01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:49.300
he talks about resistance and how it,
this constant,

1185
01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:51.110
but if you keep showing up enough fatal,

1186
01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:55.060
the gods will kind of reveal in pieces your story.
Yes.

1187
01:03:55.090 --> 01:03:58.570
And he talks very openly about the idea that,
you know,

1188
01:03:58.571 --> 01:04:00.830
a muse comes to him and Steven King,
I've,

1189
01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:02.920
I've heard him say something very similar as well.

1190
01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:06.460
And I always say that I feel like when,
when my ideas come to me,

1191
01:04:06.461 --> 01:04:08.020
when they come to me,
it's when I'm empty,

1192
01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:11.740
when I'm empty and then they just filing in and I'm just sort of sorting them

1193
01:04:11.741 --> 01:04:13.810
out along the way when they come to me on stage.

1194
01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:18.280
Like I've had bits come to me on stage full bits and like just comes to me.

1195
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:21.310
Like it might be two or three minutes long and I'll keep going on it.

1196
01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:25.120
And it's crazy.
It's like inside of the sky,
you know?
Weird,
isn't it?
Yeah.

1197
01:04:25.210 --> 01:04:28.270
I allow myself to,
for that to happen on purpose.

1198
01:04:28.271 --> 01:04:31.450
I put myself in tricky situations.
I'll put myself like,
well,

1199
01:04:31.540 --> 01:04:34.420
I'll start talking about something where I don't have any a bit on it.

1200
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:37.420
I don't even know what I'm gonna say.
And I'll put myself in that situation,

1201
01:04:37.421 --> 01:04:41.300
show that like I'm on my hyper comedy mode cause I'm onstage.

1202
01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:44.230
And there's pressure because people are watching and sometimes you know,

1203
01:04:44.231 --> 01:04:46.720
sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
If it doesn't,

1204
01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:50.020
then it just seems like I'm talking about nonsense for like a minute.

1205
01:04:50.170 --> 01:04:53.860
And then I had passion quickly as something that I know is going to be funny,

1206
01:04:53.861 --> 01:04:56.890
get back.
But every now and then you'll go down a road and then,
oh look,

1207
01:04:56.891 --> 01:04:58.330
I found a bag of gold.
And there's just,
yeah.

1208
01:04:58.750 --> 01:05:02.080
<v 1>And you know,
you almost can't,
can't take credit for that.
No,
you can't.</v>

1209
01:05:02.081 --> 01:05:06.250
Musicians talk about it like a jazz musicians call it swinging and when they're

1210
01:05:06.251 --> 01:05:08.140
out on that limb and they're swinging,

1211
01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:10.390
they gotta find their way back in a thematic way.

1212
01:05:10.391 --> 01:05:13.660
That comes back to the original tune they were playing and that that's,

1213
01:05:13.690 --> 01:05:18.010
that's what Milton went.
Marcel photo that exists in Jujitsu that exists in,

1214
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.910
<v 2>in even in playing pool,
there's a thing in playing pool,</v>

1215
01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:23.560
you call where you are in dead stroke when you're in dead stroke.

1216
01:05:23.710 --> 01:05:28.120
It's like your arm is tuned into the stick,
which is tuned into the ball,

1217
01:05:28.121 --> 01:05:29.530
which is tuned into the cloth.

1218
01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:32.950
You know exactly how hard you have to hit the ball to move it in a certain

1219
01:05:33.010 --> 01:05:33.760
position.

1220
01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:37.030
You know exactly what kind of spin in English and it's all just automatic.

1221
01:05:37.031 --> 01:05:39.720
You don't even have to think,
you can't miss stuff,
I think.

1222
01:05:39.721 --> 01:05:41.170
I think that's what I really,

1223
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:45.130
what drives me in art or whatever you call the tonight's show up.
You know,

1224
01:05:45.131 --> 01:05:49.240
it's like it.
Flannery O'connor is great writer in the 30s died of ms whatever,

1225
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:53.080
and she,
she said,
I sit at my typewriter every morning at six 30 not to write,

1226
01:05:53.081 --> 01:05:57.400
but in case something happens.
So it's an act of faith,
you know?
Well,

1227
01:05:57.401 --> 01:06:00.940
that's the Pressfield argument that he believes that you show up and that the

1228
01:06:00.941 --> 01:06:04.860
muse will,
will greet you,
that you put in the discipline and it will reward you.

1229
01:06:04.890 --> 01:06:07.990
You need to put it in the discipline.
The gods have to see that you are worthy.

1230
01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:12.130
But he's the company offers guy that I've ever heard address resistance and the

1231
01:06:12.131 --> 01:06:14.320
resistance to write,
which I have very badly.

1232
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:16.720
And I think everyone created all does.
We all do.

1233
01:06:16.721 --> 01:06:21.400
It's like getting into cold water,
you know,
like,
you know,
it's like,
uh,
when you,

1234
01:06:21.401 --> 01:06:23.360
when you're just,
you just like,
I got to get in this cohort.

1235
01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:26.020
I know my body is going to acclimate and once you start flowing,
you're flowing.

1236
01:06:26.021 --> 01:06:29.380
But right.
I the things I find to do everyday rather than,
right.

1237
01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:33.610
Like I cleaned the dishes.
I'll be,
I'll make every phone call,
I can,

1238
01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.820
I'll read articles on the web that have nothing to do with anything off.

1239
01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:40.180
I'll find incredible websites.
I'll beat off,
forget it.

1240
01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:43.120
The problem with the Internet is that it's right there on your computer.

1241
01:06:43.121 --> 01:06:46.360
And so when you're supposed to be writing,
I have this awesome program.

1242
01:06:46.361 --> 01:06:49.960
It's called Wright Room.
Check this out and it,
I have it for the Mac,

1243
01:06:50.020 --> 01:06:53.110
but when you click on it and it opens up you a,

1244
01:06:53.111 --> 01:06:57.520
you lose everything on your desktop.
So that like that.
So it's just green,

1245
01:06:57.760 --> 01:07:01.890
green print that's collect background.
It's awesome.
And uh,

1246
01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:06.280
that's how I write now because I'm such a monkey,
I can't allow myself any,

1247
01:07:06.281 --> 01:07:10.290
any possible distractions.
I'm just too stupid here.
You're in good company.
So I,

1248
01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:13.780
but why is it that so many creative people are like that?
I mean,

1249
01:07:13.781 --> 01:07:18.550
why is it if you love the idea of creating and I do,
I love,
I love writing blogs.

1250
01:07:18.551 --> 01:07:21.010
I love putting them up and getting feedback.
I love the people,

1251
01:07:21.011 --> 01:07:23.290
enjoy them and I'm loving writing this book.
I love it.

1252
01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:26.860
Like last night I wrote a bunch of good shit that I really enjoyed and it's so,

1253
01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:30.640
such a good feeling to go to and I go to bed like all energized,

1254
01:07:30.641 --> 01:07:34.530
like I feel like,
wow,
I did some good shit.
Like,
but why is it that like the,

1255
01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:37.360
the next day I will a watch,
you know,

1256
01:07:37.361 --> 01:07:41.350
15 youtube videos on the 2011 Shelby Mustang,
you know,

1257
01:07:41.351 --> 01:07:45.520
and for 45 minutes,
550 horsepower,
man,
look at that aluminum block,

1258
01:07:45.521 --> 01:07:47.910
that things to shit.
It's a modern muscle car.
I mean,

1259
01:07:47.970 --> 01:07:51.870
I don't get any size if I leave and I go to bed when I do that feeling the

1260
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:56.800
stress.
Cause you haven't done your work.
Exactly.
I,
I shouldn't be,

1261
01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:57.341
you know,

1262
01:07:57.341 --> 01:08:00.720
like really pretend that I'm not disciplined because I'm pretty destructive.

1263
01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:05.050
I get a lot of shit done,
but not as much as I could.
No,
I think um,

1264
01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:09.310
Adderall I think does that the key,
that's what you need.
I don't need that shit.

1265
01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:13.030
I know someone who's on that and he got no pills going to take you away from the

1266
01:08:13.031 --> 01:08:16.040
human condition.
And the responsibility of,
of,
of actually what

1267
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:19.190
<v 1>I think is neat about art is like creating things.
Usually you're,
you're,</v>

1268
01:08:19.191 --> 01:08:22.070
you're creating something out of nothing but,
but,
but not that.

1269
01:08:22.071 --> 01:08:24.260
It's not connected to other things and other experiences,
but,

1270
01:08:24.261 --> 01:08:25.820
but you're trying to create something out of nothing.

1271
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:28.730
But the other issue is that I find writing and you know,

1272
01:08:28.731 --> 01:08:30.620
as you find your voice and whatever you're doing,

1273
01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:33.680
you're actually getting down and distilling who you really are.

1274
01:08:33.681 --> 01:08:35.870
You get down to the core of who you really are.

1275
01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:39.080
And it's way easier in life to pretend man ways you're in life,

1276
01:08:39.081 --> 01:08:40.550
to be a character.
It just is.

1277
01:08:40.551 --> 01:08:44.960
I spent so much time as a kid building armor around myself because the world was

1278
01:08:44.961 --> 01:08:49.670
a dangerous place.
And,
and that really wasn't where my strength lay.
You know,

1279
01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:54.140
most of us are there.
There's a saying that I had a teacher,

1280
01:08:54.141 --> 01:08:57.200
an old teacher used to say,
in order to be all you can be,

1281
01:08:57.201 --> 01:09:01.010
you've got to face up to who you're pretending to be.
Uh,
and it really,

1282
01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.130
I think most of us are walking around man playing a character and not really

1283
01:09:04.131 --> 01:09:06.950
even,
do you ever listen to conversations with people?
End Up exposes that,

1284
01:09:06.951 --> 01:09:10.010
but acting does not.
No,
it doesn't.
Acting reinforces that those,

1285
01:09:10.011 --> 01:09:12.320
those shields to get thicker and deeper.
Probably.

1286
01:09:12.321 --> 01:09:15.040
I do think that like someone like Daniel Day Lewis might be gay.

1287
01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:16.340
He said something interesting.
He was like,

1288
01:09:16.341 --> 01:09:17.990
why are you guys so interested in my process?

1289
01:09:18.290 --> 01:09:23.050
I show up on a set having thoughts that don't belong to me.
And,

1290
01:09:23.051 --> 01:09:27.390
and,
and talking like that,
like awake and he goes in,
you know why I'm an actor?

1291
01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:29.160
They go,
why they,
if it was like,
why,
why?
He goes,

1292
01:09:29.370 --> 01:09:34.010
because I'm essentially ashamed of being a boring Middleclass Englishman.

1293
01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:38.330
I do love boring life,
so I have to pretend it was so great,

1294
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:41.210
but he does in some way tap into a real act.
Yeah.

1295
01:09:41.230 --> 01:09:43.880
And he taps into a truth within them.
I think.
Like he,

1296
01:09:43.881 --> 01:09:47.000
he likes to find that character within him that actually exists.

1297
01:09:47.001 --> 01:09:49.850
Maybe it's a past life.
Well,
I think what he's really good at it.

1298
01:09:49.851 --> 01:09:53.360
He's really good at becoming another human being,
you know?
And that's,

1299
01:09:53.361 --> 01:09:54.800
there's a real art in that,
you know,

1300
01:09:54.801 --> 01:09:56.960
you have to assume it's not judging that other human being.

1301
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:59.870
That's what the art is,
I think,
you know,
becoming them.
Yeah.

1302
01:09:59.871 --> 01:10:03.380
Like when you play like a Robert Duvall was playing Stalin and I think he said,

1303
01:10:03.410 --> 01:10:07.760
um,
he said,
well,
I'm,
um,
how do you play a monster?
And he says,
he's not a monster.

1304
01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:09.800
And they said,
what are you killed?
40 million people?
He goes,
yeah,

1305
01:10:09.801 --> 01:10:12.200
but the actual can't think that.
And they said,
well,
what'd you do?
And he said,

1306
01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:15.830
I played a man trying to solve a problem.

1307
01:10:16.730 --> 01:10:20.390
And if that problem was too many people in the Ural Mountains,
well,

1308
01:10:20.391 --> 01:10:23.840
I've got to get rid of them.
I'm just trying to industrialize the Soviet Union.

1309
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:27.200
Our problem is we're in the 18 hundreds.
I got to industrial,

1310
01:10:27.201 --> 01:10:32.030
which means I've got to move entire swaths of people over there.
And by the way,

1311
01:10:32.031 --> 01:10:34.910
if you're in my way,
I got it.
I got to kill you.
It's just easier.

1312
01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:38.690
And it was really interesting.
He said that that's,
that's,
that's the way you,

1313
01:10:38.691 --> 01:10:42.140
you can't judge the person that you're playing those actors.

1314
01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:44.270
That's a different breed.
That's a complete breed.

1315
01:10:44.271 --> 01:10:45.520
Apart from what we're talking about.

1316
01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:48.590
We shouldn't even be calling them actors because they just happened to choose

1317
01:10:48.591 --> 01:10:53.110
acting.
The nutty people,
or we should call them just energy holes,
you know,

1318
01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.810
whether they're actors or singers or could,

1319
01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:57.950
they could be comic book artists or whatever the fuck they are.

1320
01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:01.490
There's just those people that need,
they just need attention.

1321
01:11:01.491 --> 01:11:04.670
There's a big difference between that and like say a somebody trying to say

1322
01:11:04.671 --> 01:11:08.480
something.
Yeah.
Gary Oldman.
Yeah.
There's an artist.
Yeah,
that's,
that's a guy.

1323
01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:10.490
He becomes different human beings.

1324
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:15.100
There's a real craft to it would probably doing it regardless of money or are

1325
01:11:15.101 --> 01:11:17.650
they driven by,
it's driven by,

1326
01:11:17.651 --> 01:11:21.300
by kind of mining the psyches of the human mind,

1327
01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.850
the human psyche and driven by,
you know,

1328
01:11:23.851 --> 01:11:28.851
just producing this really perfect character and heroin and driven by a little

1329
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:34.320
bit honest.
Is He,
from what I understand,
he,
he likes it.
He likes his drugs.
Uh,

1330
01:11:34.321 --> 01:11:37.710
I guess he's better now.
It's amazing how much good music has come from heroin.

1331
01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:41.610
Yeah.
There's a lot of people that were in heroin though.
You know what though?

1332
01:11:41.611 --> 01:11:44.220
There's,
there's,
there's a counter argument to that and that is this,

1333
01:11:44.221 --> 01:11:45.940
that Nick [inaudible],
who is a rock journalist in the,

1334
01:11:45.941 --> 01:11:47.790
in the 60s wrote a book called the dark stuff.

1335
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:52.720
And a lot of people would say that what was really,
really well there was this,

1336
01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:55.470
this explosion in music and,
and with the Monterey,

1337
01:11:55.471 --> 01:11:58.230
I'm a music festival and things like that where,

1338
01:11:58.470 --> 01:12:02.790
where the drug of choice at the time was weed.
And,
um,

1339
01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:07.080
I'm a little,
a little a psychedelic,
hold on one second.
Key Up.

1340
01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:10.380
Find it online.
Voodoo child,
slight return.
Oh,

1341
01:12:10.381 --> 01:12:12.540
it's such a great Jimi Hendrix is,

1342
01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:16.500
if I had to choose like one music to listen to for the rest of my life,
only one,

1343
01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:19.730
it would be Jimi Hendrix songs.
And you'd be right there.
I'm,
I'm,

1344
01:12:19.731 --> 01:12:23.030
I'm there with Zeplin too was a rabbit heroin user.
Yeah.

1345
01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:27.830
He connected to the fucking,
the,
the vibrations of the universe.

1346
01:12:28.230 --> 01:12:30.540
Here's what,
this is what,
here's what they find,

1347
01:12:30.900 --> 01:12:33.240
what they believe killed that music movement,

1348
01:12:33.241 --> 01:12:37.400
yet this incredible successful music.
What was was heroin?
Cocaine.

1349
01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:39.270
It's because it,
yeah.

1350
01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:44.310
And so what you had was a bunch of musicians in the 60s who's heroes were who

1351
01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:48.210
the black blues musicians and Stanley crouch wrote this really cool.

1352
01:12:48.211 --> 01:12:51.990
I say that said that what happened was guys like Janis Joplin,

1353
01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:54.810
Jim Morrison,
Jimi Hendrix,
et Cetera,

1354
01:12:54.811 --> 01:12:58.620
who died all coincidentally at 27 was that they're heroes with these blues

1355
01:12:58.621 --> 01:13:03.300
musicians who are doing drugs,
right?
They,
they,
they wanted to be like their,

1356
01:13:03.301 --> 01:13:06.090
their heroes.
They were subscribing.

1357
01:13:06.270 --> 01:13:09.540
They were subscribing to an addiction as opposed to overcoming something.

1358
01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:12.900
Whereas the black musicians who had to come in through the back door and play

1359
01:13:12.901 --> 01:13:15.870
for a wide audience and eat a hotdog and a warm cup of coffee,

1360
01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:18.780
they basically felt guilty as like survivor guilt.

1361
01:13:19.020 --> 01:13:20.580
They were making all this money in their wish,

1362
01:13:20.581 --> 01:13:22.470
but they couldn't even play at other black people and they were living in a

1363
01:13:22.471 --> 01:13:23.370
segregated society.

1364
01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:26.460
So a lot of them went into drugs as a way of dealing with that guilt.

1365
01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:29.880
Whereas you have,
you had these white sixties musicians who were like,

1366
01:13:29.881 --> 01:13:31.140
my hero did drugs.

1367
01:13:31.230 --> 01:13:34.530
I'm going to do drugs because that's part of being a rock and roller problem is

1368
01:13:34.531 --> 01:13:36.540
when you choose heroin is your drug and said a weed,

1369
01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:41.430
you're going to have a hard time staying awake to write good music.
That is true.

1370
01:13:41.431 --> 01:13:45.030
Like what?
What gives you this inspiration?
What connects you to the universe?

1371
01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:48.720
Utterly destroys your body and makes you a prisoner,

1372
01:13:48.721 --> 01:13:52.230
but like cute to the beginning of this hit to hit the very beginning.
There's,

1373
01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:56.490
there's something about the music from the fucking sixties especially like this

1374
01:13:56.491 --> 01:14:00.390
kind of Hendricks.
Do you know whether something so universal about it?

1375
01:14:00.391 --> 01:14:01.560
It just lasts.

1376
01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:04.500
Whereas I believe they were trying to say something for real and change the

1377
01:14:04.501 --> 01:14:07.070
world.
They were idealists to believe that they could.
That's what,

1378
01:14:07.071 --> 01:14:10.050
because everybody was high.
We live in a cynical time now.
Nothing,

1379
01:14:10.051 --> 01:14:12.160
nothing changes.
Anything.
Right?
Listen to this man.

1380
01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:16.570
<v 2>There had been nothing remotely like this.</v>

1381
01:14:18.730 --> 01:14:22.210
There's no one had done anything like this with a guitar before that you heard

1382
01:14:22.211 --> 01:14:26.590
anything even remotely like this?
There's one to this one guy that comes close.

1383
01:14:28.450 --> 01:14:32.020
He's a monster as me.
Yeah,
Dude.
It's just like,

1384
01:14:32.290 --> 01:14:36.700
this music is so good.
It lasts for so long.
It's still,

1385
01:14:36.701 --> 01:14:41.290
it's still on inspiring now 40 years later.
The layers to it,

1386
01:14:41.530 --> 01:14:44.200
and this is all psychedelic inspired,
you know,

1387
01:14:44.201 --> 01:14:48.280
it's all a bunch of different drugs and those drugs also 10,000 hours of

1388
01:14:48.281 --> 01:14:52.090
practice.
Yes.
It's that too.
It's that too.
It's,
it's the,
the,

1389
01:14:52.091 --> 01:14:56.860
the practice makes the discipline in the practice makes the human being the very

1390
01:14:56.861 --> 01:15:01.861
best antenna to tune in the magic of the universe and when you dissolve the ego

1391
01:15:02.021 --> 01:15:02.621
completely,

1392
01:15:02.621 --> 01:15:05.500
like when you do a lot of psychedelics and you're an artist like Jimi Hendrix,

1393
01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:08.350
you crushed that thing to the point where you just,

1394
01:15:08.351 --> 01:15:12.670
you're so open when you're on stage.
The music,
you know,

1395
01:15:12.710 --> 01:15:15.790
is doing something with a guitar in today's world who I think is unbelievable as

1396
01:15:15.791 --> 01:15:20.720
Jack White.
Yeah.
From the white stripes.
I don't know them how he loved them.

1397
01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:23.980
He was a mom.
I know a bunch of their songs that I've heard that I really enjoy,

1398
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:26.830
but I don't know enough about him.
Live note note.
No,

1399
01:15:26.831 --> 01:15:28.330
he never plays the same song twice.
It's

1400
01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:32.240
<v 1>the same way as really he's a true,
I mean,
if you hear him,</v>

1401
01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:35.680
you ever hear that Song Jolene screaming it totally.
Or,
or uh,

1402
01:15:35.690 --> 01:15:39.900
that other song he does stuff on a guitar that's Whoa,
lean.
Yeah.

1403
01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:45.230
Dolly Parton,
Dolly Parton.
What the fuck that is?
I mean,

1404
01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:48.680
it's riveting.
This is the beautiful thing about what we got going on here.

1405
01:15:48.681 --> 01:15:53.030
Do we got computers just like almost like a real radio show man.
But you know,

1406
01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:55.730
it's,
it's sad that,
you know,
the,
these,

1407
01:15:55.790 --> 01:16:00.380
all these different greats that got into heroin all wound up dying,
you know,

1408
01:16:00.410 --> 01:16:05.240
really fucked up.
Dense.
Janis Joplin,
Hendrix,
I mean,
so many great musicians.

1409
01:16:05.300 --> 01:16:06.260
What it did was,

1410
01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:10.820
what it did was it kind of had robbed us of what else they were going to be

1411
01:16:10.821 --> 01:16:14.450
capable of doing.
Right.
But is the argument that it would have never,

1412
01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.580
they would've never been who they were without the drugs.

1413
01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:20.930
And even though the drugs rob them,
it's almost like the amount of energy.
I mean,

1414
01:16:21.050 --> 01:16:23.930
this is,
it's a shitty argument,
but just for the sake of saying it,
like,

1415
01:16:23.931 --> 01:16:25.950
think about what Jimmy Hendrix has done and the,

1416
01:16:25.951 --> 01:16:29.170
the amount of impact that he had in such a short life.
I mean,
I think,
what,

1417
01:16:29.171 --> 01:16:33.320
how was he 28 or something when he died?
Uh,
he was a 37,
27.

1418
01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:35.770
So think about the amount,
the,

1419
01:16:35.771 --> 01:16:39.140
the impact that that guy had in his short time on the surf.

1420
01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:43.160
Let me hold on to this.
Uh,
listen to this song.
We'll hold on.
Sorry.

1421
01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:46.640
Think about the impact that this guy had in his short time on earth in the short

1422
01:16:46.641 --> 01:16:49.190
time where he was completely drugged out of his fucking head.
Right?

1423
01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:52.400
It's like this accelerated burst of creativity.

1424
01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:56.880
It's almost like he used up all of his energy in one big explosion,
you know?

1425
01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:57.420
Well,
is,

1426
01:16:57.420 --> 01:17:01.340
is that the case or did he already come to the table before he started doing

1427
01:17:01.341 --> 01:17:05.600
drugs?
Prodigiously talented,
potentially technical on the guitar and then,

1428
01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:09.690
and then slowly eroded that talent.
That's other question.

1429
01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:13.220
So there's a good possibility of that.
It's definitely,
I think it's,
it's both.

1430
01:17:14.180 --> 01:17:18.470
It's the wrong song.
Yeah,
no,
I'll find it.
It's uh,
these motherfuckers.

1431
01:17:18.471 --> 01:17:20.840
What kind of a radio show or we run in here.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1432
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:23.840
if you are in your car right now,
if you were at the gym,

1433
01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:26.350
if you are on the train on the way to work,
listen to him.

1434
01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:30.050
I apologize for the unprofessional behavior.
Here we go.

1435
01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:31.970
Is

1436
01:17:34.370 --> 01:17:36.440
Maybe worse recording of all times.
Yeah.
Okay.

1437
01:17:36.441 --> 01:17:40.690
I'm glad you guys are just one click.
Oh,
we'll find it.

1438
01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:45.080
This name shouting.
This is Jack White and he's singing Jolene.
Yeah.

1439
01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:48.890
And this is a Dolly Parton songs that made me cry when I was 18,

1440
01:17:48.891 --> 01:17:53.450
which I believe is about her pleading with her own addiction,

1441
01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:56.450
which is Jolene.
Don't take my man away.
Wow.

1442
01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:00.940
I really compete with you.
What was her addiction?
Uh,
not,

1443
01:18:00.970 --> 01:18:03.620
this was writing for somebody who's,
who is in the deck

1444
01:18:05.610 --> 01:18:08.960
when did that,
okay.
We don't need this part.

1445
01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:14.150
This is dumb.
No,
we're here.
So that's the worst banter ever.

1446
01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:16.430
Dude's talking to the audience in between songs.

1447
01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.070
I've got an awesome one though with Paul Stanley.

1448
01:18:19.730 --> 01:18:23.120
It's a compilation that some dude in the New York did all Paul Stanley's

1449
01:18:23.121 --> 01:18:25.700
cheesiest lines ever talking to the audience.
Yeah,
I got to hear.

1450
01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:26.570
That's fantastic.

1451
01:18:28.330 --> 01:18:33.330
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

1452
01:18:57.580 --> 01:19:00.000
got it to him.

1453
01:19:00.150 --> 01:19:05.150
[inaudible] okay,

1454
01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:41.080
<v 1>dude,
that's,
that's a talented motherfucker.
He's unbelievable.</v>

1455
01:19:41.081 --> 01:19:45.310
He filled the whole kind of for me,
uh,
that,
that when Kurt Cobain died,

1456
01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:48.610
he kind of replaced my Kurt Cobain for me.
Really?
Yeah.
I know.
I need,

1457
01:19:48.611 --> 01:19:50.230
I need to pay attention more to them.
I to,

1458
01:19:50.290 --> 01:19:52.270
he's a total innovator and it's a two man band.

1459
01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:56.860
What is it about someone singing a really bad ass song to just really gives you

1460
01:19:56.861 --> 01:20:01.690
a burst in your body?
It might be,
it might be.
It might be.
Honestly,

1461
01:20:01.691 --> 01:20:04.210
to me,
the most powerful art form and for that reason,
yeah.

1462
01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:08.940
You literally feel inspiration and energy.
Yeah.
It,

1463
01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:12.960
this woman,
Karen Armstrong wrote a book called the case for God and she was,

1464
01:20:12.961 --> 01:20:15.120
it was a,
it was like,
she was like,
you know people,
well,

1465
01:20:15.121 --> 01:20:17.680
you have atheist who talk,
they look at a fundamentalist concept of God.

1466
01:20:17.681 --> 01:20:20.040
And she said,
look.
She goes,
wow,

1467
01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:22.080
God is not something you're supposed to be able to explain.

1468
01:20:22.081 --> 01:20:25.350
But I can tell you when you listen to an incredible music of sounds like an

1469
01:20:25.351 --> 01:20:30.351
incredible piece of music that's Britain PR that's profoundly sad yet fills you

1470
01:20:30.661 --> 01:20:34.140
with,
with an inexplicable joy or,
or,
or,

1471
01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:37.590
or tense energy or quickening energy.
Um,

1472
01:20:37.770 --> 01:20:41.580
that inspiration is every bit as real as what you can touch in front of you.

1473
01:20:41.581 --> 01:20:46.140
That that is maybe more real in what we stay alive for.
And that is,

1474
01:20:46.170 --> 01:20:49.270
she gives,
she gives sort of a,
she correlates that with the,
the,

1475
01:20:49.290 --> 01:20:53.160
with the divine or the concept of a god or this benevolent insane good that we

1476
01:20:53.161 --> 01:20:57.990
can't really actually measure or categorize.
And it's kind of a cool some,

1477
01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:58.821
what music is,

1478
01:20:58.821 --> 01:21:02.580
is like an energy source that we create an emotional energy source.
And if you,

1479
01:21:02.581 --> 01:21:05.160
if you put the words right in the music right,

1480
01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:08.430
and the right person delivering it with the right amount of honesty,

1481
01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:10.160
it just taps into the,
the,

1482
01:21:10.170 --> 01:21:14.550
the very like the just the fiber of your being or something.
It just charges you,

1483
01:21:14.551 --> 01:21:18.510
well,
it's called harmony.
You know,
the Greeks describe beauty in one word.

1484
01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:21.870
Socrates said,
how do you describe beauty?
And Aristotle and Socrates,
they,

1485
01:21:21.890 --> 01:21:25.980
they always used one word that harmony.
So when you see a cheetah running,

1486
01:21:26.100 --> 01:21:28.590
you say,
that's beautiful.
The reason you see it,
you say it's beautiful.

1487
01:21:28.591 --> 01:21:33.400
It's because its body is working in such harmonious like,
um,
uh,

1488
01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:35.820
it's such lockstep with itself.

1489
01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:40.890
That's why I call fights beautiful.
Whenever like,
no doubt,
Mash guys,

1490
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:42.510
I'm always the,
I always say,

1491
01:21:42.511 --> 01:21:46.200
look at this beautiful combination and why Kelly ends with this kick to the body

1492
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:49.440
and he'd see his whole body cave in this beauty,
in that man,

1493
01:21:49.441 --> 01:21:52.770
man fighting to me like I,
the reason I love watching,

1494
01:21:52.771 --> 01:21:56.760
fighting and I always love to fight when I was coming up and young and stuff was

1495
01:21:56.761 --> 01:21:59.930
that,
to me it is,
it is one of the purest things,
uh,

1496
01:21:59.970 --> 01:22:02.850
someone can endeavor to do because when you fight,

1497
01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:05.220
like on the level of guys like Nate,
Mark Core,
Anderson Silva,

1498
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:09.960
it requires all of you all acquires,
you're cutting,
your courage,
your strength,

1499
01:22:09.961 --> 01:22:12.270
your flexibility.
People say,
oh,
he's a horseback ride.

1500
01:22:12.271 --> 01:22:14.880
Or you use every muscle in your body.
You don't know what you're talking about.

1501
01:22:14.881 --> 01:22:17.700
Getting a ring and all around,
Bro,
that's a different muscle.

1502
01:22:17.701 --> 01:22:21.600
You don't even have to spar anybody.
Go Punch the bag for three minutes.

1503
01:22:21.630 --> 01:22:24.290
But also if you're going to go of somebody trying to kick you and punch in the

1504
01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:25.860
head,
you may not come out the same.
You May,

1505
01:22:25.890 --> 01:22:27.810
you may be dead or you may be massive,

1506
01:22:27.840 --> 01:22:30.720
massive emotional charge connected to your performance.

1507
01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:34.500
You're literally fighting over.
You're very health.
You're very health longterm,

1508
01:22:34.710 --> 01:22:38.130
not just tonight.
That's right.
You know,
if you find a really scary dude,

1509
01:22:38.131 --> 01:22:39.480
you know you fight an Anderson Silva,

1510
01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.020
you have to think that guy's going to change your brain.
Well,

1511
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:45.690
I might head kick you and change your brain.
It also faces every man.

1512
01:22:45.691 --> 01:22:48.030
I believe every man,
his biggest fear is that he's a coward.

1513
01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:51.330
Like if you ask every man's biggest aspirations as he wants is to be a hero.

1514
01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:54.000
And as big as fear is that he finds himself out to be a coward.

1515
01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:57.720
And when you fight and you put yourself into a ring where somebody might kick

1516
01:22:57.721 --> 01:22:58.640
and punch you,

1517
01:22:58.641 --> 01:23:01.860
you face up to that and it's why I have so much respect for fighters.

1518
01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:04.590
I've always found them to be.
I've always found fighting to be.

1519
01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.280
When I watch a really great fight,

1520
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:10.930
I cry sometimes because I find it's so dramatic and glorious,
like the pants on.

1521
01:23:11.230 --> 01:23:13.390
I never wear my pants.
I never wear my pants.

1522
01:23:13.391 --> 01:23:16.670
I always wear a testicle essential though to keep myself discipline to
testicles.

1523
01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:19.330
It's made of hemp rope.
I can't go into it right now,

1524
01:23:19.331 --> 01:23:22.660
but I sell them on my website,
which is your website,
Brian cowen.com.

1525
01:23:22.661 --> 01:23:25.630
Brian Killen docs know why I don't really cry,

1526
01:23:25.631 --> 01:23:29.080
but it just sounds good for chicks,
but sounds awesome.
Do you Twitter a lot?

1527
01:23:29.081 --> 01:23:31.660
Do you check your Twitter first time I went to Brian's house,

1528
01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:33.860
first time ever Brian had a,

1529
01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:36.350
what is it to kill a mockingbird sitting there on his,
uh,

1530
01:23:36.351 --> 01:23:40.310
his coffee table or something,
something like probably say,
oh no,

1531
01:23:40.311 --> 01:23:42.550
we don't have all the books out.
Yeah.
What was,
what was the,

1532
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:45.640
who was supposed to kill a mockingbird?
I had,
I had Shakespeare.

1533
01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:48.680
Jack Kerouac was out and so I came over to his house and the fruit.

1534
01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:51.550
I just immediately started giving them shit.
I like,
what the fuck are you doing,

1535
01:23:51.551 --> 01:23:53.170
but you ain't reading these things.
I go,

1536
01:23:53.171 --> 01:23:56.290
you throw these down for when chicks come over.
You look like all deep and Shit.

1537
01:23:56.710 --> 01:23:59.350
I called Jimmy Burke.
I was like,
dude,
I'm a hoax.
I'm a hoax.

1538
01:23:59.351 --> 01:24:02.860
I'm laying books around my room.
There's one girl I liked and she was like,

1539
01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:05.470
she had gotten a Harvard and I'm literally throwing books out.

1540
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:08.980
I didn't like Babette's feast.
I don't even know what I was like,
Bat,
bat speed.

1541
01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:13.120
I've,
I've never read this book.
I hadn't read any of them.
That's hilarious.
Sorry,

1542
01:24:13.121 --> 01:24:14.440
I'm a man of letters.
When I met Brian,

1543
01:24:14.441 --> 01:24:17.560
he didn't have a lock or a front door knob.
He lived,

1544
01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:20.140
he lived in a fucking apartment.
It was on television.
Okay.

1545
01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:23.080
He lived in an apartment.
It just had a whole,
and I go,
what happened?

1546
01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:25.480
I was fucking girl came over and things got crazy.
Whatever.

1547
01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:30.460
Where did you live in Venice?
Venice is fucking dangerous.
On the beach.

1548
01:24:30.461 --> 01:24:33.370
He had an apartment on the beach,
which was awesome by the way,

1549
01:24:33.371 --> 01:24:36.460
which is the first time I'd ever known anybody who actually lived on the beach.

1550
01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.830
Like you left his apartment like you opened a window.

1551
01:24:38.831 --> 01:24:40.270
There's the ocean's right there.

1552
01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:43.210
Like you would go leave his apartment and you just walk right out onto the
beach.

1553
01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.610
It was fucking,
it was uncredible.
You want to come over to my house?

1554
01:24:45.611 --> 01:24:47.600
I've got a puppy in the view of the beach.
You want to,

1555
01:24:47.601 --> 01:24:51.060
I don't know what you're doing.
Anything right now.
I'm on TV.
I'm on TV.
Yeah,

1556
01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:53.380
I was 28 years old.
Do you think I got laid am on TV?

1557
01:24:53.381 --> 01:24:56.260
I've got a puppy and a view of the beach.
You want to come meet you live there.

1558
01:24:56.530 --> 01:24:59.260
What made you love about girls?
Girls.
That's what the beach,

1559
01:24:59.261 --> 01:25:03.840
the beach front calculate.
Well,
why you think I'm going to act well?

1560
01:25:03.841 --> 01:25:05.050
What do you tell?
What kind of question is that?

1561
01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:08.650
So you became an actor just for chicks.
If you want to get serious with me now.

1562
01:25:08.651 --> 01:25:11.970
I never want to embarrass me and why?
Fine.
Let's get that.
You want to be,

1563
01:25:11.971 --> 01:25:14.830
you want to get you and we end the truth here.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1564
01:25:14.831 --> 01:25:15.940
That's why I did everything.

1565
01:25:16.670 --> 01:25:19.570
I literally started learning how to fight so that I didn't have to be in a bar

1566
01:25:19.571 --> 01:25:22.600
with somebody like hit on my girl.
I had to walk away bad in front of her.

1567
01:25:23.010 --> 01:25:25.920
I was like at least like your own safety.
Just worried about cutting down.

1568
01:25:25.921 --> 01:25:26.754
You're pushing,
right.

1569
01:25:26.770 --> 01:25:30.040
At least I look at least I don't look like a coward even though I am.

1570
01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:33.430
At least I can fake it and keep the guy busy for awhile and get laid.

1571
01:25:33.431 --> 01:25:37.300
Hopefully later on.
Do you bust out the,
Hey,
I was in sex in the city.
That's cool.

1572
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:38.930
What do I have my real on me,
you know,

1573
01:25:38.931 --> 01:25:40.590
out of the loop when they come into my house,

1574
01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:42.970
I'm playing it on your iPhone should have a keyed up on youtube.

1575
01:25:42.990 --> 01:25:47.530
One thing on again,
this is crazy.
You know,

1576
01:25:47.531 --> 01:25:49.570
a lot of people recognize me from sex and the city,

1577
01:25:49.571 --> 01:25:53.230
but they really recognize me from being an original cast member on mad TV.

1578
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:56.980
The hangover to somebody just recognize me.
I'll recognize myself sometimes.

1579
01:25:57.850 --> 01:26:01.150
The Mad TV thing was such a strange thing,
man.
You want to do it?

1580
01:26:01.151 --> 01:26:05.090
How many seasons to seasons?
You got lucky you escaped.

1581
01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:09.860
That was the weirdest environment ever for like a talk show.

1582
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:13.160
Yeah,
it was very weird.

1583
01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:17.360
There was a lot of like weird competition and there was a lot of like weird

1584
01:26:17.361 --> 01:26:20.780
energy there.
Yeah man,
it was a,
it was a rough place.
You didn't like it.
Right?

1585
01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:23.540
It was cool that I got to meet already.
Lying there too.
Yeah,
I didn't like it.

1586
01:26:23.541 --> 01:26:26.600
I loved rd.
How fucking great is that guy?
He's great.

1587
01:26:26.601 --> 01:26:30.470
And how sad is his whole situation man?
I think he uh,
yeah,

1588
01:26:30.471 --> 01:26:34.440
I think Ardi just uh,
has always struggled with those demons.
You don't know.

1589
01:26:34.490 --> 01:26:38.660
He attempted suicide and stabbed himself and stab themselves up a bunch of
times.

1590
01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:42.770
Funniest Guy,
by the way,
for me,
probably the funniest guy off the cuff,

1591
01:26:42.771 --> 01:26:45.380
like the most improvisational funny guys I've ever met.

1592
01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:49.430
He used this and a beautiful person.
Yeah,
he's a great guy.
Always,

1593
01:26:49.431 --> 01:26:52.120
always enjoyed running into him,
you know?
And uh,

1594
01:26:52.130 --> 01:26:54.910
it made me really sad when I would listen to them on the stern show and I'd
hero,

1595
01:26:54.911 --> 01:26:59.090
he's falling apart.
It's just very depressing.
Yeah,
no,
the very depressing.

1596
01:26:59.091 --> 01:27:03.080
You see that big,
you know,
seeing him not take care of himself and get that big,

1597
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:06.590
yeah,
I guess I don't know what his condition is.
Do we know that's kind of,
no,

1598
01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:09.980
I don't know.
I have no idea.
Have no information.
It's kind of a weird situation,

1599
01:27:09.981 --> 01:27:10.760
man.
When you're,

1600
01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:15.760
you become that big fat guy that everybody loves because people love big fat

1601
01:27:16.311 --> 01:27:19.910
guys that don't give a fuck,
you know?
And also what happens if you lose weight?

1602
01:27:19.910 --> 01:27:22.610
Does that mean to be funny anymore?
And Persona goes away?

1603
01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:24.380
She always lost a hundred pounds.

1604
01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:29.180
Jody has lost a hundred pounds and he's funnier than ever.
He's still a fat guy.

1605
01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:32.690
Joey DA's.
Not Joey Diaz is just,
he's such a character.
He's so great.

1606
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:35.390
One of the greatest human beings I've ever met.
One of the coolest,

1607
01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:39.480
most interesting fines ever as far as like people to hang out with.

1608
01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:41.690
You know what man?
He's a guy.

1609
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:46.270
Joey Diaz is the guy who so colorful and so I see somebody,

1610
01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:48.830
but we'll have these friends and you end up hanging out with a guy and you're

1611
01:27:48.831 --> 01:27:52.440
not laughing.
Once you hang around,
Joey Diaz get constantly and you,

1612
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:56.090
you're just stare at him and listen to his amazing stories.

1613
01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:59.120
Our friend Eddie Bravo had a,
a wristband on once.

1614
01:27:59.121 --> 01:28:03.530
It was a leather wristband that he was wearing,
you know,
rock and roll,

1615
01:28:03.531 --> 01:28:07.450
man transformation.
And uh,
he,
uh,
had this leather wristband on show.

1616
01:28:07.451 --> 01:28:09.410
He looks into,
goes,
what are you waiting for?
A fucking Falcon,

1617
01:28:09.411 --> 01:28:14.360
the land on your arm.
And he got so pissed off.
He was really upset.
I always,

1618
01:28:14.361 --> 01:28:17.810
Eddie,
Eddie,
Eddie Bravo is good.
It's fucking build a Jujitsu empire.

1619
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:20.570
Every time I see this bridge spans,
I am always like,
oh,
that's cool.

1620
01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:23.240
What are you wearing?
A fucking fall down.
That echoes I head.

1621
01:28:23.241 --> 01:28:25.490
That's one of my jokes.
I always talk about if you're gonna wear a Cape,

1622
01:28:25.491 --> 01:28:29.660
you gotta have a Falcon and not a penguin.
Cause that's true success rate.
Yeah,

1623
01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:33.500
I'd love to.
I didn't even get laid in 2010 with a Cape and totally fall apart.

1624
01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:35.940
Well,
it was the last time someone could rock a Cape and not look stupid.

1625
01:28:35.941 --> 01:28:37.270
I've made a comeback.
I don't know if you know,

1626
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:41.750
if you're the pope and you can bless a billion people like this,

1627
01:28:41.751 --> 01:28:42.890
you can wear a cape.
Other than that,

1628
01:28:42.891 --> 01:28:46.730
I may be Johnny Depp and get away to go out of style and the must've hundreds,

1629
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:51.350
hundreds along with the coach and buggy.
Okay.
And those crazy blonde wigs.
Yeah,

1630
01:28:51.351 --> 01:28:55.760
dude,
because you can't wear a cape and a Cape is very handy.

1631
01:28:55.761 --> 01:28:59.330
You can doubles as a rap if there's like a bee swarm.

1632
01:28:59.331 --> 01:29:02.340
People like base by water can just be like whatever.

1633
01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:05.930
<v 2>And just,
you know,
they're not going to sting a red tent.
Fuck you bs.</v>

1634
01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:10.660
It's a Mexican fear factor.
It was a,
uh,

1635
01:29:10.710 --> 01:29:14.940
they made their own stunts,
like really dangerous low budget.

1636
01:29:15.270 --> 01:29:17.970
And there was a Mexican host and the Mexican guy wore a cape.

1637
01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:22.170
Really?
Yeah.
There was one that I saw at,
well,

1638
01:29:22.171 --> 01:29:24.600
I don't know if you were a in every episode,
but a Mormon one that I saw,

1639
01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:27.210
that guy was wearing a cape and uh,
he was,
uh,

1640
01:29:27.420 --> 01:29:30.900
he had these people go through this burning building and we did the exact same

1641
01:29:30.901 --> 01:29:34.770
stunt,
but when we did it,
they had fire suits on and helmets and shit.

1642
01:29:34.771 --> 01:29:38.430
And we had people waiting with hoses and people on standby,

1643
01:29:38.431 --> 01:29:41.430
but we let this fucking building on fire and they had to go in and rescue this

1644
01:29:41.431 --> 01:29:45.300
dummy and bring it out.
It's very difficult and hard to see.
They didn't shorts.

1645
01:29:45.570 --> 01:29:48.630
They re they reproduce.
They think people would fucking shorts.

1646
01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:51.780
They were getting third degree burns and shit running through fire with shorts

1647
01:29:51.781 --> 01:29:56.670
on,
you know,
they're not snow.
Mexico doesn't give a fuck.

1648
01:29:56.671 --> 01:29:59.280
Do I give a shit?
They don't give a toff.
Even the boxers,

1649
01:29:59.281 --> 01:30:01.260
like by the time the children eat those down,

1650
01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.600
they closed down a big part of a Arizona,

1651
01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:06.150
the national park in Arizona because it's too much,

1652
01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:10.020
too much Mexican gang member violence from the drug cartels.

1653
01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:12.780
It's bleeding over in Arizona.
Mexicans are very,

1654
01:30:12.781 --> 01:30:15.210
very much like when you watch the boxing style,

1655
01:30:15.211 --> 01:30:16.620
they'll stand in a hole and just bang it out.

1656
01:30:16.621 --> 01:30:18.990
There's no like moving out of the way,
just like,
let's take the,

1657
01:30:18.991 --> 01:30:21.310
let's take the punishment and p and c,
you can punch you shorter.

1658
01:30:21.450 --> 01:30:25.620
They enjoy fisticuffs and balls,
but I mean like guys like Chavez,

1659
01:30:25.650 --> 01:30:28.260
even though he took a lot of shots,
he was very hard.
Yeah.

1660
01:30:28.261 --> 01:30:30.870
He was very elusive for a guy that would stay on top of him saying like,

1661
01:30:30.871 --> 01:30:34.560
I got like Mayweather's always staying out of the way.
It's just the whole deal.

1662
01:30:34.561 --> 01:30:37.770
Before I even learned how to fight Mayweather is the most cautious of all the

1663
01:30:37.771 --> 01:30:38.604
boxers,

1664
01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:41.640
even when he hurts the guy and doesn't pour it on what would have happened with

1665
01:30:41.641 --> 01:30:44.040
him in that pack.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Who knows?

1666
01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:47.490
It's a fascinating fight and I think a lot of people want to see it.

1667
01:30:47.491 --> 01:30:51.180
It's a dangerous fight for him,
for,
for,
uh,
for,
for me,
whether it's dangerous.

1668
01:30:51.181 --> 01:30:54.600
That's why you think he was saying,
but pack,
y'all could get fucked up too,
man.

1669
01:30:54.610 --> 01:30:58.710
Mayweather's awesome.
And May was a boxer and he's so sharp.

1670
01:30:58.890 --> 01:31:01.880
His technique is so good.
He has a such a deep knowledge of boxing.

1671
01:31:01.890 --> 01:31:04.410
He's also bigger than packet.
Yeah.
He's,
he's bigger.

1672
01:31:04.410 --> 01:31:08.700
His keys technique might be a little cleaner,
a little less fat to it.
He's,

1673
01:31:08.750 --> 01:31:12.120
he's a very smart guy to Pacquiao though.
It was a wild man,
dude.

1674
01:31:12.121 --> 01:31:16.080
If you look at like his knockout of Ricky Hatton,
the way took apart,
dude,

1675
01:31:16.081 --> 01:31:19.410
he's a monster.
That little dude is so fast.

1676
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:22.260
His technique is so good too.
He's just,
you know,

1677
01:31:22.261 --> 01:31:24.480
apparently with Cota when he was a,

1678
01:31:24.481 --> 01:31:29.020
I was at that fight and I was pretty close to the ring and w w um,

1679
01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:32.520
I didn't hear this,
but,
uh,
Freddie Roach afterwards was saying that,
you know,

1680
01:31:32.521 --> 01:31:35.820
I was telling him to knock him out and he didn't say this in so many words,

1681
01:31:35.821 --> 01:31:36.820
but I heard this from somebody else,

1682
01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:39.960
took third person Paca kind of likes Cota and didn't want to knock them out.

1683
01:31:39.961 --> 01:31:42.700
You could see he clearly had figured his number out.
He could figure it.
He,

1684
01:31:42.710 --> 01:31:46.410
if he got his whole game and he didn't put him,
he didn't put them away.

1685
01:31:46.411 --> 01:31:47.570
He was just hitting him.
But he,

1686
01:31:47.571 --> 01:31:51.180
he actually liked him and knew he could really hurt him but didn't unreal.
Yeah.

1687
01:31:51.450 --> 01:31:54.710
And before that fight,
I was with some people who were friends with them,
like,

1688
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:58.350
like Jeremy Piven who was doing a documentary about his life.
He looked over,

1689
01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:00.100
you never see a fighter do this.
He looked up,
I went,

1690
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:03.850
<v 1>how are you?
And it was doing and like,
like he was like,</v>

1691
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:07.030
like had walked into a club.
He was that relaxed.
Wow.

1692
01:32:07.060 --> 01:32:10.480
And then just went in there and I remember watching when as soon as code,

1693
01:32:10.481 --> 01:32:14.740
I think realized that that patio had figured his game out.
Like his,

1694
01:32:14.741 --> 01:32:18.370
his whole Jig was up and he all he had was just covering you just jab and

1695
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:21.490
covering and that must be pretty frustrating.
Fuck yeah.

1696
01:32:21.491 --> 01:32:23.590
When you see why all of a sudden just get lit up.

1697
01:32:23.710 --> 01:32:25.610
Like you remember when Pacquiao fought,
um,

1698
01:32:25.810 --> 01:32:29.140
Oscar de la Hoya and you could see like somewhere in like the second round,

1699
01:32:29.141 --> 01:32:32.350
Oscar de la Hoya had this look in his face.
Like,
what the fuck just happened?

1700
01:32:32.510 --> 01:32:35.380
Like I can't even hit this dude.
Like this is,

1701
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:38.950
this dude is just levels above me and I just got to go into a shell here and

1702
01:32:38.951 --> 01:32:43.480
survive,
you know,
fights a little bit like Duran did a little bit.
Yeah,

1703
01:32:43.481 --> 01:32:48.010
a little bit.
But you know,
he's,
he's,
he's really a style of his own,
you know,
his,

1704
01:32:48.011 --> 01:32:51.520
his leg movement is like,
its ability to leap in and leap out,
you know,

1705
01:32:51.521 --> 01:32:55.600
how fast he is and how mobile he is and how hard he hits too.

1706
01:32:55.601 --> 01:32:58.450
He's a bad little motherfucker.
It's really hard.
It's almost as hard as monogamy.

1707
01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:01.750
But anyway.
What?
Hey,
what's up?
Fuck you talking about.

1708
01:33:01.751 --> 01:33:05.260
So you have a two and a half year old.
I have a two and a half year old.

1709
01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:07.510
Still haven't got our kids together.
This is ridiculous.
I know.

1710
01:33:07.511 --> 01:33:10.730
We've got to do a two year olds.
They're almost exactly the same age.

1711
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:14.500
We're both so similar in the fact that we're always so fucking busy.

1712
01:33:14.501 --> 01:33:16.940
We never get anything done that we're supposed to be doing.
Yeah,
I know.

1713
01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:19.240
We're going to do that though,
man.
It's always so much fun.

1714
01:33:19.370 --> 01:33:21.910
You're like one of my best friends that I never signed now.
It's terrible.

1715
01:33:22.270 --> 01:33:27.010
It's terrible.
So how far does the same vadis you still live in Venice?

1716
01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:29.670
Yeah.
Yeah.
You got to thinking about moving out though.
Yeah,

1717
01:33:29.671 --> 01:33:32.350
you got to get out the gang land.
I told him the episode of Gangland this month.

1718
01:33:33.340 --> 01:33:37.930
Is it?
No,
I'm sure it has been.
They have fucking Tampa is on ganglion,

1719
01:33:37.931 --> 01:33:40.660
they find in Tampa.
There's a lot of gangs everywhere,
man.

1720
01:33:40.730 --> 01:33:44.680
Well that's a dumb show,
boy.
Gangland no,
it's scary.

1721
01:33:44.710 --> 01:33:47.040
It makes you think that there's gangs everywhere and everyone's shooting

1722
01:33:47.050 --> 01:33:49.300
everybody.
I like the first 48 you ever watch that show?

1723
01:33:50.110 --> 01:33:52.330
That's my new favorite show that I love that show.

1724
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:56.070
Those shows were all educated criminals.
Now they know what not to do.
Yeah.

1725
01:33:56.260 --> 01:33:58.240
But you know,
a lot of a lot of crime though is,

1726
01:33:58.241 --> 01:34:02.440
is passionate and you're not thinking and you leave a trail and with technology,

1727
01:34:02.530 --> 01:34:04.450
the other thing is about that survivor guy.

1728
01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:07.580
Do you know the guy who's one of the producers of survivor and his wife,
uh,

1729
01:34:07.620 --> 01:34:11.770
turned up missing in Mexico and then they found her in a sewer and he's back

1730
01:34:11.771 --> 01:34:13.840
over in America and they're trying to figure out where they're going to charge

1731
01:34:13.841 --> 01:34:18.130
him and deport them to Stucco and what's going to happen really kill this wife

1732
01:34:18.131 --> 01:34:19.870
fucking arguing,
screaming and yelling.

1733
01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:23.250
The people heard screaming and yelling and then all of a sudden she disappears.

1734
01:34:24.660 --> 01:34:29.260
Fuck.
How scary is that?
People that are involved in relationships that are dirt,

1735
01:34:29.290 --> 01:34:30.880
they hate each other so much.

1736
01:34:30.881 --> 01:34:33.640
They just resort to killing each other in a marriage.

1737
01:34:33.641 --> 01:34:36.610
Like you got to know while you're killing someone.
I'm like,
oh my God,

1738
01:34:36.611 --> 01:34:39.550
my life is over.
I'm fucking killing it.
I gotta be honest with you.

1739
01:34:39.551 --> 01:34:43.960
I've had girls bring me to that level.
You have.

1740
01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:47.770
I'm not saying,
I'm not saying it's good.
I've gotten out of that,
but I have,

1741
01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:51.200
I have been in some awful just,

1742
01:34:51.250 --> 01:34:55.420
I've been outside of myself watching myself just behave like a huge,

1743
01:34:55.421 --> 01:34:58.220
a whole are both similar in that we

1744
01:34:58.220 --> 01:34:58.640
<v 2>have,</v>

1745
01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:03.320
we both taken chances on a lot of really crazy chicks just cause it was fun.

1746
01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:06.740
You know?
We are fun.
By the way.
When we first came to Hollywood,

1747
01:35:06.741 --> 01:35:09.470
we both did the exact same thing because we used to talk about it all the time.

1748
01:35:09.710 --> 01:35:12.380
Who would date someone that was just like fucking completely insane,

1749
01:35:12.381 --> 01:35:13.850
but it was like,
Eh,
no big deal.

1750
01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:17.380
It's fun that Phil Hartman Shit cleared all that out for me for sure.

1751
01:35:17.570 --> 01:35:21.770
When Phil Hartman got murdered by his wife,
I was like,
okay,
no more.

1752
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:25.220
That's okay.
I just figured this out.
I thought it was fun.
This is not fun.

1753
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:27.830
This is,
this is crazy.
What you bring into your life,
man.

1754
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:30.420
And you see dudes do it all the time.

1755
01:35:30.450 --> 01:35:33.530
It makes things more exciting and it's a good distraction too,
you know,

1756
01:35:33.670 --> 01:35:36.710
cause especially in the stress of Hollywood and the stress of,
you know,

1757
01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:39.980
trying to make it,
it's like there's sometimes the stress is overwhelming.

1758
01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:42.950
You just want to get lost in something else.
So you want to have in a lot of sex.

1759
01:35:42.951 --> 01:35:45.890
Are you saying you call it in a crazy relationship?
A nanny.
But you know,

1760
01:35:45.891 --> 01:35:49.070
Dove Davidoff says if love was a drug,
people would be like,
dude,

1761
01:35:49.071 --> 01:35:53.690
stay away from that stuff.
You could lose your house.
Know that's fine.

1762
01:35:53.691 --> 01:35:56.880
It's the wrong kind of love.
It's true.
It is.
It's totally true.
Well it's,

1763
01:35:56.881 --> 01:35:58.970
it's not even just a love mean call it love,

1764
01:35:58.971 --> 01:36:02.270
but really it's the weird connection that people have to each other where they

1765
01:36:02.271 --> 01:36:05.280
need each other.
You,
you become connected.
Like,
ew,
ew,
ew.

1766
01:36:05.300 --> 01:36:09.770
There's a bridge between you and this person and you literally need them in your

1767
01:36:09.771 --> 01:36:11.780
life.
You know,
you can shake yourself of it,

1768
01:36:11.781 --> 01:36:15.410
but it's very hard getting out of a relationship.
I mean that twice.

1769
01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:18.310
How many dudes,
you know,
have you seen that their,

1770
01:36:18.311 --> 01:36:21.170
their girl breaks up with them and then starts dating someone else that they

1771
01:36:21.171 --> 01:36:24.740
know and they literally go insane.
Yeah,
it's insane.

1772
01:36:24.741 --> 01:36:28.250
It's like someone stealing happiness from you right in front of your eyes,

1773
01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:31.700
but you can't ever accept the fact that this is just a human being that doesn't

1774
01:36:31.701 --> 01:36:33.430
like you anymore and likes this other human beings.

1775
01:36:33.570 --> 01:36:35.420
It also comes down to a lot of people I believe,

1776
01:36:35.421 --> 01:36:39.530
get into relationships just so they can control someone else with their emotions

1777
01:36:39.531 --> 01:36:41.330
and with their,
you know that that's the other thing.

1778
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:44.020
A lot of it really is what you learned from watching your parents.

1779
01:36:44.050 --> 01:36:47.750
If your parents are fucked up and a lot of people's ours,
it takes a lot to,

1780
01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:50.600
a lot of people's parents are really fucked up.
Right?

1781
01:36:50.630 --> 01:36:54.230
It takes a lot to overcome that early program.
And I think a lot of,

1782
01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:56.030
I don't know what you think about this,
but I was thinking about,

1783
01:36:56.031 --> 01:36:58.820
I think a lot of making a relationship work is just not,
first of all,

1784
01:36:58.821 --> 01:37:02.900
having very low expectations and then also coming to the equation and staying in

1785
01:37:02.901 --> 01:37:06.800
the equation as,
as a very,
as a very independent person.
Yeah.

1786
01:37:06.801 --> 01:37:09.920
You have to be independent and you also have to grow together and you also have

1787
01:37:09.921 --> 01:37:12.260
to be really honest with each other and you also have to find one.

1788
01:37:12.261 --> 01:37:14.300
There's not nuts and you have to not be nuts to,

1789
01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:17.780
in order to find one who's not nuts,
you have to not be nuts as well.
Absolutely.

1790
01:37:17.781 --> 01:37:20.020
You know,
to find a nice person,
you've gotta be nice,

1791
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:21.350
you gotta be worthy of a nice person.

1792
01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:24.240
I had the best advice someone ever gave him to make a relationship work groups.

1793
01:37:24.241 --> 01:37:27.950
Well,
he said he had been married for 25 years ago.
What's your secret?
He goes,

1794
01:37:27.951 --> 01:37:30.530
dude,
I,
I know we,
we learn how to fight.

1795
01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:33.850
We learned that there are boundaries in places you don't go and we learn how,

1796
01:37:33.870 --> 01:37:36.740
like when we were frustrated or angry with each ever get shitty with each other

1797
01:37:36.830 --> 01:37:40.430
and insult each other.
Don't get violent,
don't throw things,
don't break my stuff.

1798
01:37:40.460 --> 01:37:43.970
Don't fucking,
don't call work and be a continent.
Don't get nutty.

1799
01:37:43.971 --> 01:37:45.020
Don't let your fear with things.

1800
01:37:45.021 --> 01:37:50.021
There's a way to fight and if you learn how to release the tension or whatever,

1801
01:37:50.031 --> 01:37:53.270
you'll you can make it work for a long time.
Are you listening to my son?
Yes.

1802
01:37:53.271 --> 01:37:56.010
This is what's weird is I was in a relationship that was so bad at one

1803
01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:59.850
<v 1>point that I had to start recording her,
you know,
as evidence and I'm like,</v>

1804
01:37:59.851 --> 01:38:04.080
I remember thinking going on semesters,
I was thinking like this is,

1805
01:38:04.590 --> 01:38:08.070
this is so bad that I am recording people for evidence.

1806
01:38:08.071 --> 01:38:11.180
I need to get out of this relationship.
And do you have those times?
Yeah.

1807
01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:15.080
Can we do something with those well out named?
It did.
Perhaps depending.
Yeah,

1808
01:38:15.081 --> 01:38:18.330
maybe.
Maybe we'd be about names.
We could beat it up.
Yeah.

1809
01:38:18.331 --> 01:38:20.250
Let's just change the sound of the voice.

1810
01:38:20.251 --> 01:38:23.220
Just a we just a wee bit because I've heard about these.

1811
01:38:23.221 --> 01:38:24.720
I think those would be interesting.

1812
01:38:24.721 --> 01:38:28.580
I actually public it would take me a while to find them,
but yeah,
I'd love that.

1813
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:30.820
Mel Gibson,
one dat boy.
Woo.

1814
01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:34.290
There's another example we were talking about actors being fucking crazy and

1815
01:38:34.291 --> 01:38:37.230
thinking that you know that they're much more important and interesting than

1816
01:38:37.231 --> 01:38:40.150
they are because they're successful and he might,
people kiss their ass.
Yes.

1817
01:38:40.290 --> 01:38:44.220
Genuinely be sick.
I think so too.
I think that's insanity.

1818
01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:47.340
Well he's an alcoholic and you know doctor drew was talking about him and he was

1819
01:38:47.341 --> 01:38:49.380
saying that it seems like he's probably relapsed.

1820
01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:51.690
Like if you listened to the way he's talking and he's like,

1821
01:38:51.720 --> 01:38:56.190
and he has some sort of a mental issue,
a bipolar issue or something,
but,

1822
01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:59.160
but you know how much maybe that came from being an actor.

1823
01:38:59.190 --> 01:39:03.230
Maybe they came from people kissing your ass on the set.
You start believing it.

1824
01:39:03.590 --> 01:39:06.400
I did it when the part of rational part of your brain just stops working.

1825
01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:08.590
Just like a guy who takes roids in his bowl shrink.

1826
01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:12.000
I also think the acting when you're on a set all day,

1827
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:16.110
it gets so boring cause real acting on a movie is waiting around all day.

1828
01:39:16.111 --> 01:39:20.430
Like I did this movie with Nick naulty and in Pittsburgh and Nick's been,
uh,

1829
01:39:20.490 --> 01:39:22.710
you know,
just the mixed martial arts and he's been doing,

1830
01:39:22.711 --> 01:39:25.950
this is the one where you play me.
Yeah,
I play you.
Oh yeah.
Oh by the way,

1831
01:39:26.250 --> 01:39:27.190
by the way,
as a movie coming,

1832
01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:30.870
I'm in co coming out called warrior that just tested through the roof for lions

1833
01:39:30.871 --> 01:39:34.680
gate.
It's got Tom Hardy and nick naulty and,
and,
and,
and uh,
this guy,

1834
01:39:34.710 --> 01:39:37.920
this Australian actor,
Joel Edgerton and some really great actors.
But anyway,

1835
01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:40.730
it's going to be a great movie.
But,
um,
I,

1836
01:39:40.850 --> 01:39:43.950
I played Joe Rogan I to prepare for the role.

1837
01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:49.100
I literally watched a about Phi 50 hours of you,

1838
01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:52.830
and I'm not kidding on UFC.
Remember I called you about it.
I said,
you know,

1839
01:39:52.831 --> 01:39:56.130
and you said,
just take your time out of the equation as a,
as an announcer.

1840
01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:59.550
Anyway,
I watched you and watched you and I've gotten some rave reviews from my

1841
01:39:59.551 --> 01:40:03.420
performance late.
Thank you to my friend Joe Rogan.
I literally played too.

1842
01:40:03.421 --> 01:40:05.520
I was like,
how would Joe do this?
And then I just was,

1843
01:40:05.521 --> 01:40:09.470
you give us an example like where you real technical IRS agent.

1844
01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:14.490
I used words like wow.
And that there,
that's a huge move.
Cute.

1845
01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:17.340
You know,
just that like joke,
it's,
you don't really get huge.

1846
01:40:17.341 --> 01:40:21.840
Whether it's words and by the way he loves the game.
And I,
I'll tell you,

1847
01:40:21.841 --> 01:40:23.790
and I've had other people say this who really know sport.

1848
01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:29.360
If you are as good as it gets at what you do when it comes to calling us fights,

1849
01:40:30.031 --> 01:40:33.210
you're so knowledgeable,
you're so passionate about it.
And,

1850
01:40:33.240 --> 01:40:36.300
and I don't know of anybody who can call a file.
Thanks man.
It,
but it's,

1851
01:40:36.301 --> 01:40:40.130
you know what,
honestly,
it's um,
I'm just a professional fan.
It's easy because,
uh,

1852
01:40:40.230 --> 01:40:40.900
because of standup,

1853
01:40:40.900 --> 01:40:44.400
cause San San up is so difficult and you get really good at communicating and

1854
01:40:44.401 --> 01:40:48.000
you get really good at understanding,
you know,
economy of words and you know,

1855
01:40:48.001 --> 01:40:49.890
how to set things up and you know,
and,

1856
01:40:49.930 --> 01:40:52.900
and really self aware of how your sound and your,
you're,

1857
01:40:53.300 --> 01:40:57.010
I have so much harder that doing,
doing commentaries like weight easy.

1858
01:40:57.070 --> 01:41:00.050
But you know,
who else is great as Goldie gold is great,
he's fun.

1859
01:41:00.460 --> 01:41:04.960
The poetry he uses.
Like he's a poet man,
he's a poet.
He's so impressive.

1860
01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:06.800
Well he's very smooth,
you know,

1861
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:09.160
and people like give him a hard time about saying stupid shit,

1862
01:41:09.161 --> 01:41:12.490
which you don't understand is how much of that he's just whinging.
You know,

1863
01:41:12.491 --> 01:41:16.630
he's winging a big chunk of the stuff that he's saying.
You know?

1864
01:41:16.631 --> 01:41:19.270
And sometimes when you wing Shit,
it doesn't always come out right.

1865
01:41:19.271 --> 01:41:20.350
And then you're,
you know,

1866
01:41:20.351 --> 01:41:23.650
you're stuck in a bad spot and you've got to kind of correct yourself a little

1867
01:41:23.651 --> 01:41:26.020
bit or you know,
and we goof on each other every now and then.

1868
01:41:26.021 --> 01:41:30.130
If we say stupid things,
you know,
but what he does is very hard to replace.

1869
01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:33.750
You know,
I tried doing his job once and I was terrible at it.
Now he's,

1870
01:41:33.770 --> 01:41:38.440
he's a very specific skill.
It is.
It is.
It's a very specific skill,

1871
01:41:38.650 --> 01:41:41.050
but you know,
you're,
you're the best there is at it.
So it's,

1872
01:41:41.051 --> 01:41:44.440
it's pretty fun to watch you while you spent like two months in Pittsburgh doing

1873
01:41:44.441 --> 01:41:46.990
that and you know,
I think it's going to be worth it at the end of the day.

1874
01:41:46.991 --> 01:41:49.450
It's a great movie.
So when does it come out?
Well,

1875
01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:50.890
they were going to release it September,

1876
01:41:50.891 --> 01:41:53.620
but it tested so high that I think lion's gate wants to push it toward the

1877
01:41:53.621 --> 01:41:56.410
Oscars,
if from what I'm told.
So,
uh,
maybe,

1878
01:41:56.411 --> 01:41:59.290
maybe December or something changed or you feel like it's that good?

1879
01:41:59.291 --> 01:42:01.990
Did you like it?
I haven't seen it yet.
I just saw clips.

1880
01:42:02.020 --> 01:42:03.940
But I liked the movies that you're in.

1881
01:42:03.941 --> 01:42:08.320
Are you one of those dudes that even though you're washing,
hanging over once,
um,

1882
01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:11.770
and I,
I'm almost never,
nobody believes me,
but I never watched what I do.

1883
01:42:11.850 --> 01:42:14.500
I'd love to.
I'm too critical of myself.
Hate those guys though,

1884
01:42:14.501 --> 01:42:17.410
that if they do something all of a sudden it's awesome and they love it.

1885
01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:21.520
Like you can't admit like Bob,
your show sucks.
Yeah.
It goes back to being,
um,

1886
01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:26.240
not honest with yourself and not having perspective.
I mean,
uh,
you know,
the,
I,

1887
01:42:26.250 --> 01:42:31.160
I don't watch what I do because I'm already critical enough and um,
you know,

1888
01:42:31.161 --> 01:42:34.690
it's,
for me it's not even about the movie that comes out as they experience.

1889
01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:35.360
It's fun.

1890
01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:39.460
Sometimes you have a really good time having a laugh on a set and doing and

1891
01:42:39.810 --> 01:42:43.420
acting or making believe that's fun for me.
I don't do it.
You know,

1892
01:42:43.421 --> 01:42:44.440
I do it because it's fun.

1893
01:42:44.441 --> 01:42:47.710
I think where I feel artistic is when I'm with stand up,

1894
01:42:47.711 --> 01:42:50.760
where I'm writing my own stuff and I'm kind of expressing myself.
That's a,

1895
01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:54.290
a different,
there's a different motivation for it.
So,
you know,
fuck you out.

1896
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:56.680
That's the most fun thing for sure.
The way you know,
you know,

1897
01:42:56.681 --> 01:42:59.470
the thing about standards is you can never lie to yourself because you get up on

1898
01:42:59.471 --> 01:43:00.304
stage.

1899
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:04.360
They either laugh where they don't and it's pretty brutal if it starts going

1900
01:43:04.361 --> 01:43:07.750
south,
man,
and you're in the middle of nowhere and somebody can't be faking.

1901
01:43:07.751 --> 01:43:11.020
What's funny that you think you have to really be connected to it in order to be

1902
01:43:11.021 --> 01:43:11.860
good.
And it,

1903
01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:14.440
let me ask you this about standing up not to turn us into a stand up thing.

1904
01:43:14.441 --> 01:43:16.510
But one of the other thing is,
um,
I thought about this,

1905
01:43:16.511 --> 01:43:17.940
somebody asked me some advice.
I go,
well,

1906
01:43:17.941 --> 01:43:21.250
I'll just write with your what you think is funny,
but in a way,
if you're trying,

1907
01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:26.400
if you're trying to be funny as opposed to I'm just expressing yourself honestly

1908
01:43:27.611 --> 01:43:31.480
in a way that makes you laugh.
Um,
when you're trying,

1909
01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:34.510
the audience kind of feels,
you manipulating them,

1910
01:43:34.630 --> 01:43:38.820
they feel the lie and it's never as funny.
Do you know what I mean by that?

1911
01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:41.800
It might work a little.
Yeah,
it does.
If you've been doing it for,

1912
01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:45.920
did you so long to see comedian,
the church comedian?
Yes,
I did.
You,

1913
01:43:45.970 --> 01:43:48.910
so then you saw orange Adams performing.
Yes,
I did.

1914
01:43:48.970 --> 01:43:52.190
And that's the kind of comedy I'm talking about.
That's the kind of,
it does work.

1915
01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:56.200
<v 2>It's possible.
I don't believe it.
Well,
you know,
and,</v>

1916
01:43:56.650 --> 01:44:00.290
and when people don't believe it,
it's that key word.
But there's like that,

1917
01:44:00.300 --> 01:44:03.470
that sort of style is like a style,
you know,

1918
01:44:03.590 --> 01:44:07.880
there's a style that will work in a crowd but will not work one on one.

1919
01:44:08.250 --> 01:44:12.110
Like Joey Diaz can tell you something one on one and it's just as fucking funny

1920
01:44:12.111 --> 01:44:14.060
as if he stand in front of 300 people saying it.

1921
01:44:14.210 --> 01:44:18.950
But there's a lot of comedy that's like,
so to them and premise and you know,

1922
01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:22.390
enunciation.
But it's a song I can hear the punchline could,

1923
01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:26.390
it's not funny as opposed to honest expression.
Let's let me still work.
Yeah,

1924
01:44:26.391 --> 01:44:27.171
it'll still work.

1925
01:44:27.171 --> 01:44:30.590
But then that's the difference between a hack and a real comic in my opinion.

1926
01:44:30.591 --> 01:44:33.120
Not to be too much of a purist that way,
but yeah,
we,
right.

1927
01:44:33.121 --> 01:44:36.170
Someone who's like on stage and they're getting angry at something that they,

1928
01:44:36.230 --> 01:44:39.530
they're not really,
why do I get two receipts?

1929
01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:42.970
What is this kills when they go crazy?
Like go you really mad.

1930
01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:45.290
It's a piece of paper you put in your pocket and you leave because somebody
said,

1931
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:47.930
I walked in and I heard a guy like that and I want to do that.
I walked in,

1932
01:44:47.931 --> 01:44:50.410
I went,
oh,
I can't,
I can't stay here.
Yeah.
And my buddy Ken says,

1933
01:44:50.510 --> 01:44:52.730
you can't be that judgemental.
And I go,
dude,
I know that song.

1934
01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:56.180
I can hear two bars of that song and I know exactly where it's going.

1935
01:44:56.181 --> 01:44:59.180
I've been doing it too long,
you know?
And it makes you feel unfunny.

1936
01:44:59.181 --> 01:45:01.750
The thing is when you watch someone who saw uninspiring,

1937
01:45:01.751 --> 01:45:03.350
it takes all the energy out of me.
Exactly.

1938
01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:07.130
I worked with this guy and I what my opener couldn't make it like in the last

1939
01:45:07.130 --> 01:45:09.890
minute.
And so I work with this local guy and this local guy,

1940
01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:11.270
not only did he suck,

1941
01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:15.710
he went on for 45 minutes and he did a bunch of my shit.
No.
Yeah,

1942
01:45:15.711 --> 01:45:20.711
he did like reworked bits that were like from my old cds and he did this before

1943
01:45:20.781 --> 01:45:25.340
he brought me up and I don't know if he was doing it to be a dick and step on my

1944
01:45:25.341 --> 01:45:27.570
material if he doesn't know,
I don't even do those anymore.

1945
01:45:27.571 --> 01:45:31.340
That was like years and years old or if he was trying to fuck with my head or if

1946
01:45:31.341 --> 01:45:33.880
he's so retarded that he just,
this is what he does,

1947
01:45:33.900 --> 01:45:37.220
just steal shit everywhere and he forgets where it came from.
Wow.

1948
01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:41.150
I went on after him and I had to like jolt myself to be funny.

1949
01:45:41.330 --> 01:45:44.450
Like I had to listen to it because I wanted to know what the fuck he was saying.

1950
01:45:44.540 --> 01:45:46.460
Once I heard some of my material,
I'm like,
Ugh,

1951
01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:49.190
now I have to listen to this guy because I don't want,
I mean,

1952
01:45:49.191 --> 01:45:52.530
what if he does something that I do do right.
I don't want to repeat it,
you know,

1953
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:53.960
so I have to listen this fuck now.

1954
01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:57.980
So I'm listening to this guy and it's like shocking all the inspiration out of

1955
01:45:57.981 --> 01:46:02.981
my brain and nothing he says he believes everything he says is just angry and

1956
01:46:03.171 --> 01:46:07.480
stupid.
And somebody said,
uh,
they said,
how do you know?
This woman asked me,

1957
01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:10.130
how do you know gene Hackman's a great actor?
What's your criteria?
And she goes,

1958
01:46:10.190 --> 01:46:13.560
because I always believe him.
You know,
it's the same kind of thing.
Yeah.

1959
01:46:13.940 --> 01:46:15.830
Same thing with the comic that you go,
Oh,

1960
01:46:15.831 --> 01:46:18.590
I always believe you like Daniel Day Lewis.
You don't have to go into it.

1961
01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:20.960
Do you believe them or not?
You know?
Yeah.
I mean,

1962
01:46:20.961 --> 01:46:22.680
and you know yourself when stuff,
when,

1963
01:46:22.681 --> 01:46:26.390
when stuff connects and stuff is real and there's a process in developing

1964
01:46:26.391 --> 01:46:29.690
material where there's a lot of times your go down a path and there's nothing

1965
01:46:29.691 --> 01:46:32.240
there for you that you thought there was.
You're fucking around with it.

1966
01:46:32.241 --> 01:46:34.280
But for whatever reason it doesn't come out and that,

1967
01:46:34.290 --> 01:46:37.190
that is a part of the process.
But there's a big difference between that,

1968
01:46:37.191 --> 01:46:42.191
which is just like someone trying to find the comedy and someone forcing it.

1969
01:46:42.590 --> 01:46:43.423
Someone like,

1970
01:46:44.530 --> 01:46:47.750
I've written plenty of things where I know it like the people would laugh.

1971
01:46:47.751 --> 01:46:50.060
Like I'll come up with that like a thing and it's like a trick and you go,

1972
01:46:50.060 --> 01:46:53.580
<v 1>oh that's a trick.
I can't do it though because it's not me.
Like,
like that's a,</v>

1973
01:46:53.850 --> 01:46:56.880
that's a trick on the audience that's just there to be funny.

1974
01:46:56.881 --> 01:47:00.530
It's like a surprise,
like a magic trick.
Like oh here's the list doing that.

1975
01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:01.790
I don't want to be that gun in that.

1976
01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:05.130
That sort of takes you out of who you are when you're on stage cause then you're

1977
01:47:05.131 --> 01:47:09.390
aware of that and when you're aware of that then it takes away from the muse,

1978
01:47:09.391 --> 01:47:12.210
whatever that weird connection is where you feel like you're a passenger.

1979
01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:16.340
Exactly.
You have sex with Kirstie Alley,
right?
Whoa.

1980
01:47:16.860 --> 01:47:20.610
I did not fuck.
Might have stepped up,
but at the hell Brian,
I didn't show.

1981
01:47:20.611 --> 01:47:23.120
This is great.
I didn't know I'd be saying,
is this the whole point of this fuck.

1982
01:47:23.310 --> 01:47:28.020
I'd be an ambush man.
It's all a trick.
Oh,
can I plug that?

1983
01:47:28.020 --> 01:47:32.520
I'm going to be a,
where you at?
I'm going to be at the Irvine Improv tomorrow.
Uh,

1984
01:47:32.580 --> 01:47:35.010
headlining eight o'clock.
Irvine Improv.
Oh,

1985
01:47:35.011 --> 01:47:37.410
the Irvine Improv is the shit I just did a whole weekend there.

1986
01:47:37.411 --> 01:47:41.310
That place is awesome.
I love it.
Irvine is awesome.
That's another good place.

1987
01:47:41.311 --> 01:47:43.290
You might have a little go family man show.

1988
01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:46.950
Did you see the Nick Diaz response to last week's podcast?
Yeah,

1989
01:47:46.951 --> 01:47:50.650
he was upset at me.
Him.
Wow.
Good.
Well do you know what Nick Diaz,

1990
01:47:51.150 --> 01:47:55.080
he's saying also that may him,
uh,
is too big then he wants to,

1991
01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:58.020
why does it make him come down to one 71?
Are you picking on me?
I'm,
you know,

1992
01:47:58.021 --> 01:48:01.200
I'm smaller than you,
which is true,
you know,
made him can never make one 70.

1993
01:48:01.201 --> 01:48:03.180
I mean he made it a long time ago when he fought GSP,

1994
01:48:03.181 --> 01:48:05.490
but he had to starve himself and get down there.
You know,

1995
01:48:05.970 --> 01:48:09.360
think ds is a natural one.
70 what?
What is your call if a,

1996
01:48:09.361 --> 01:48:11.790
I don't want to put you on the spot,
but if GSP fought Anderson Silva,

1997
01:48:12.750 --> 01:48:16.710
well if you gained weight the correct way,
you know,
um,
it would be very,

1998
01:48:16.711 --> 01:48:18.480
very interesting because will they do,

1999
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:23.250
Anderson is definitely the best wrestler that the or or GSP rather is definitely

2000
01:48:23.251 --> 01:48:26.940
the best wrestler.
That Anderson is fun,
but physically he's a smaller man.

2001
01:48:27.810 --> 01:48:30.990
Anderson is really tall.
He's tall.
He's like,
I think he's six three,

2002
01:48:30.991 --> 01:48:34.980
six two or six three and he's really long,
man.
He's really long with his limbs.

2003
01:48:34.981 --> 01:48:38.670
That's one of the reasons why he can go up to two oh five and then down to 85 I

2004
01:48:38.671 --> 01:48:41.220
don't think he could make one 70 though.
He's thought about it.

2005
01:48:41.221 --> 01:48:44.160
He might be able to,
but it might be my too much of a strain on them.

2006
01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:49.260
But at one 85 man,
he's hard to fuck with he so fast.

2007
01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:53.250
Is that what it is?
Yeah.
And if he's standing in front of GSP and GSP,
you know,

2008
01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:58.560
can't take them down or if he decided to trade with them and gets caught and

2009
01:48:58.561 --> 01:49:01.890
Anderson catches you.
He's so fucking accurate.
But he will.

2010
01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:04.860
He's got a big test and Chael Sonnen because Chael Sonnen,

2011
01:49:04.890 --> 01:49:08.790
the fight that he's having on August 7th that is the biggest guy at one 85

2012
01:49:08.791 --> 01:49:11.270
that's a wrestler.
Chelsea big motherfuckers.
He really,

2013
01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:14.430
when you saw him manhandled Nate Marquardt.
Anybody that can do that today.

2014
01:49:14.490 --> 01:49:19.390
Nate Marquardt is no jokes and beast.
Nate Marquardt.
It's a fucking beast.

2015
01:49:19.510 --> 01:49:23.410
You know handled last wrestler,
I think Greco Roman guy.
Yeah,

2016
01:49:23.580 --> 01:49:27.600
he's a beast too and he has his double his power double.

2017
01:49:27.601 --> 01:49:31.320
He runs through guys.
It's like impossible to stop almost but,

2018
01:49:31.450 --> 01:49:35.190
but up if he tries to,
if he tries to trade with a,
he's got it.
Yeah.

2019
01:49:35.191 --> 01:49:36.480
He's going to be fucked.
If he,

2020
01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:39.870
everybody who tries to trade with Anderson gets fucked.
He's too accurate.

2021
01:49:39.871 --> 01:49:44.190
He's too slick.
He has in an athletic ability.

2022
01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:48.100
That's very rare.
He's has this ability to move in and out

2023
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:50.440
<v 2>so fast.
If you look at the Damien Maia fight,</v>

2024
01:49:50.441 --> 01:49:54.330
like how quickly he can like launch an attack and move forward and spring acts

2025
01:49:54.331 --> 01:49:58.870
you and tag you.
Th the need that he hit my with was,
he was like no wind up.

2026
01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:01.840
He just leaped through the air and smashed him with a fucking flying knee.

2027
01:50:02.050 --> 01:50:05.320
There's very few humans that could,
he looks like he's got springs in his body.

2028
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:06.850
The way he handled Forrest Griffin,

2029
01:50:06.851 --> 01:50:10.180
nobody's ever been able to do that to Forrest.
Forrest Griffin is huge,
huge,

2030
01:50:10.210 --> 01:50:12.300
huge and good punter kicker too.
Yeah,

2031
01:50:12.301 --> 01:50:16.030
he's a real solid to 30 before he cuts down at two oh five.

2032
01:50:16.031 --> 01:50:19.990
He's a giant light heavyweight and Anderson just ate him up.
He's just,

2033
01:50:20.140 --> 01:50:23.540
he's a freak,
but they would like can to stop the shot.
That would be the thing.

2034
01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:27.370
And the other guy like that is um,
a fedora.
I'd love to see him fight Brock.

2035
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:28.240
I just see that we're doing,

2036
01:50:28.240 --> 01:50:30.790
I know I got caught in that and nothing to take away from for doing,

2037
01:50:30.791 --> 01:50:34.570
but I mean he kind of,
that,
that's something that anybody can get caught in.

2038
01:50:34.571 --> 01:50:38.920
But as far as like just timing and being able to connect and counter.
I mean,

2039
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:41.890
he's just ridiculous.
I would like to see him fight life.
He's a,

2040
01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:45.550
I think he's definitely a special athlete,
but he's also a small heavyweight,

2041
01:50:45.870 --> 01:50:49.390
you know,
it's two 30 or something and he showed up big hole in his game with the

2042
01:50:49.391 --> 01:50:53.740
overdoing fight.
He said he just got over confident,
which I,
I could see.
I mean,

2043
01:50:53.741 --> 01:50:56.170
why wouldn't you get over confident?
You haven't lost and Tyler's,

2044
01:50:56.410 --> 01:50:59.680
everyone's fucking terrified of you,
but he just,
you know,

2045
01:50:59.710 --> 01:51:01.490
you fucked up and we're doomed.
Garden for two.

2046
01:51:01.491 --> 01:51:03.070
It was just too nasty off of his back.

2047
01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:05.480
I would like to see him fight again though.
He's got to fight Alistair Overeem,

2048
01:51:05.490 --> 01:51:08.500
which is an even bigger tests really,
I think.
Yeah.
What about Brock?

2049
01:51:08.890 --> 01:51:10.840
I don't ever have,
it's probably not going to happen.

2050
01:51:11.050 --> 01:51:14.470
You know why talking to happen?
Because the m one guys that control him,

2051
01:51:14.471 --> 01:51:18.040
unless they all get hit by a meteor,
it's like he's there just wanting too much.

2052
01:51:18.070 --> 01:51:22.300
You know,
the,
the,
the arguments pay him that much.
Well,
you know,

2053
01:51:22.330 --> 01:51:24.790
first of all they're all involved in some sort of a lawsuit right now that I

2054
01:51:24.791 --> 01:51:27.040
can't talk about,
but it's not,
the data wouldn't pay him.

2055
01:51:27.070 --> 01:51:31.570
It's that there's a thing called code promotion and that's what these guys want.

2056
01:51:31.571 --> 01:51:32.550
They want to be able to cope,

2057
01:51:32.551 --> 01:51:35.020
promote UFC events and that's what they were offering.

2058
01:51:35.380 --> 01:51:36.790
They wanted to give you fade or,

2059
01:51:36.791 --> 01:51:40.360
and they wanted all the other Russian guys that they handle to to fight in the

2060
01:51:40.361 --> 01:51:41.230
UFC as well.

2061
01:51:41.230 --> 01:51:44.230
So we would take on a bunch of guys that we didn't necessarily want and then on

2062
01:51:44.231 --> 01:51:45.970
top of it they would cope,
promote.

2063
01:51:45.971 --> 01:51:50.470
So it'd be UFC with m one or m one global presents UFC or whatever the fuck.

2064
01:51:50.471 --> 01:51:53.800
However they would set it up.
They would literally like share 50% of the revenue,

2065
01:51:54.100 --> 01:51:57.430
which is like the UFC was like what the fuck are you talking to them about 50

2066
01:51:57.431 --> 01:51:59.970
but still be cool like in a marvel girl cap Conner.

2067
01:51:59.980 --> 01:52:03.850
I know it's not marvel versus Capcom because m one global is it's,

2068
01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.950
they don't have enough to bring to the table.
All they have is one fighter.
UFC.

2069
01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:10.900
It's not like even dream.
If it was a copra motion between UFC and dream,

2070
01:52:11.150 --> 01:52:14.380
well at least in dream you got Aoki,
you got,
you know,
a,

2071
01:52:14.381 --> 01:52:16.630
a lot of like high level guys over there.

2072
01:52:16.630 --> 01:52:20.410
It's not quite as like high level is the UFC.
But a lot of really good guys,

2073
01:52:20.590 --> 01:52:23.470
they already all residents over there.
Dana White's genius has been,

2074
01:52:23.471 --> 01:52:26.360
he's kept the UFC,
the superstar and no one fighter.
You know,

2075
01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:29.380
he's so good at that.
Yeah,
they've made a bunch of guys famous stars,

2076
01:52:29.381 --> 01:52:32.020
but there's so many of them.
Whereas with boxing,

2077
01:52:32.021 --> 01:52:35.440
the unfortunate thing about boxing is there's really only interest on a few

2078
01:52:35.441 --> 01:52:37.420
weight divisions.
You know,
there's an interest,

2079
01:52:37.421 --> 01:52:40.600
whatever pack outs fighting whenever Lord Floyd Mayweather is fighting whatever

2080
01:52:40.601 --> 01:52:43.840
the Klitschkos are fighting.
And even the Klitschkos not so much.
You know,

2081
01:52:43.841 --> 01:52:47.720
there's,
when was the last big time paper view super fight with the Klitschkos?

2082
01:52:47.810 --> 01:52:49.430
I can't remember.
Yeah,
exactly.

2083
01:52:49.431 --> 01:52:51.660
It's never been anything that's helped us in any way.

2084
01:52:51.661 --> 01:52:55.160
Cause I never thought they were,
you know?
Yeah.
Well there he's really good.

2085
01:52:55.161 --> 01:52:57.170
Vladimir is very good technical boxer,

2086
01:52:57.171 --> 01:53:00.530
but the deal is that people don't really care enough.
There's not passion.

2087
01:53:00.531 --> 01:53:04.820
Like when Tyson was fighting or when Lennox Lewis is fighting even or Riddick

2088
01:53:04.821 --> 01:53:07.010
poll was fighting,
there's passion.
Uh,

2089
01:53:07.011 --> 01:53:08.960
Holyfield title fight was a big deal as well.

2090
01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:12.270
It's like there was passion to those guys and personality.
Yeah.

2091
01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:15.770
I mean it's not that Vladimir is not a fucking awesome boxer.

2092
01:53:15.771 --> 01:53:18.230
It's just for whatever reason people aren't passionate about watching him.

2093
01:53:18.770 --> 01:53:22.420
You know,
this is not that mean.
I mean people love Hopkins mean he's a throwback.

2094
01:53:22.430 --> 01:53:25.550
He said also finer.
Both that guy,
you know,
but you know,
like there's no,

2095
01:53:25.610 --> 01:53:29.900
he's 44 I think and,
and took at least see what he did to Kelly Pavlik.
Oh Dude,

2096
01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:34.340
he's just,
boxing is unbelievable.
We should get past Hopkins who you got,

2097
01:53:34.370 --> 01:53:37.640
you know,
you've got Pacquiao,
you've got,
you know,

2098
01:53:37.730 --> 01:53:40.340
Roy Jones Jr when he's still finding at least people are interesting.

2099
01:53:40.700 --> 01:53:44.540
But Roy Jones Jr once he lost the steps,
we've got another guy who,
you know,

2100
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:48.890
once he lost that speed,
that crazy blinding speed.
Isn't that crazy to watch?

2101
01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:52.020
It's this thing about Hopkins is Hopkins was always very tight away in the

2102
01:53:52.021 --> 01:53:55.310
middle of our pod.
You know,
we're probably going to stop.
Let's stop right now.

2103
01:53:55.590 --> 01:53:57.900
It's five minutes before we're going to stop because Brian has to ping and I to

2104
01:53:57.910 --> 01:54:00.500
be stopped with boxing talk.
But,
uh,

2105
01:54:00.770 --> 01:54:02.510
that's not the best thing for comedy podcasts,

2106
01:54:02.511 --> 01:54:05.990
but I don't think this is a comedy podcast anymore.
It's just interesting shit.

2107
01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:10.310
<v 4>fleshlight.com or go to Joe's website and click on the fleshlight link and you</v>

2108
01:54:10.311 --> 01:54:14.450
can get yourself 15% off.
It feels better than your hand flashlight,
flashlight,

2109
01:54:14.451 --> 01:54:14.880
flashlight.

2110
01:54:14.880 --> 01:54:18.870
<v 2>This a Saturday night.
I'm at the House of Blues and San Diego.
One show,</v>

2111
01:54:18.871 --> 01:54:22.530
10:00 PM with Joey Coco Diaz Cock suckers.

2112
01:54:22.710 --> 01:54:25.710
I'm coming down planes,
trains and automobiles.
Get ready,

2113
01:54:25.711 --> 01:54:29.730
bitches and a then Sunday is the UFC on versus so he'll be there for that too as

2114
01:54:29.731 --> 01:54:33.420

Um,
I hope you guys enjoyed it.
Thank you very much for tuning in.

2115

2116
01:54:36.990 --> 01:54:41.000
see you dirty bitches next week.
Thank you for nature.

2117
01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:42.580
<v 3>Bye.</v>
