00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.050
the white space that was available but
 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.560

drive the growth and evolution of these

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340
drive the growth and evolution of these
 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:29.300
drive the growth and evolution of these
games I think it's everything it's the

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310
games I think it's everything it's the
 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.250
games I think it's everything it's the
reason why we get out of bed I mean we

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:31.260
reason why we get out of bed I mean we
 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.450

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:34.410
users like you have to understand them
 

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.800
users like you have to understand them
quantitatively in the game we have to

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:36.810
quantitatively in the game we have to
 

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.870
quantitatively in the game we have to
understand them qualitatively in the

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880
understand them qualitatively in the
 

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.670
understand them qualitatively in the
game but also in their lives and the

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680
game but also in their lives and the
 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.950
game but also in their lives and the
idea is we actually write down the

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:42.960
idea is we actually write down the
 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.390
idea is we actually write down the
emotions that we want you to feel when

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400
emotions that we want you to feel when
 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:46.520
emotions that we want you to feel when
you play the game but also the emotions

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:46.530
you play the game but also the emotions
 

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.590
you play the game but also the emotions
you want to feel when you close the game

00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:48.600
you want to feel when you close the game
 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.630
you want to feel when you close the game
so they're not just entertained but just

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:50.640
so they're not just entertained but just
 

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.550
so they're not just entertained but just
then find an hour later you close the

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560
then find an hour later you close the
 

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:59.410
then find an hour later you close the
app and you're like another hour older

00:07:59.410 --> 00:07:59.420
 

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.940
okay so using user sentiment to guide

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:01.950
okay so using user sentiment to guide
 

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:03.530
okay so using user sentiment to guide
the in design obviously makes sense

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:03.540
the in design obviously makes sense
 

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.240
the in design obviously makes sense
and but as you mentioned sir it's all

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:05.250
and but as you mentioned sir it's all
 

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.820
and but as you mentioned sir it's all
it's really tricky and how do you guys

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:07.830
it's really tricky and how do you guys
 

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:09.410
it's really tricky and how do you guys
balance between optimizing for user

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:09.420

obviously we're thinking about KPIs
 

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:21.530
obviously we're thinking about KPIs
but when we're designing a new feature

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:21.540
but when we're designing a new feature
 

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.870
but when we're designing a new feature
we'll make sure we stop and think you

it's a question of like we're trying to
 

00:09:20.439 --> 00:09:22.530
it's a question of like we're trying to
build a platform a long-standing

about it's like okay well you know we
 

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.769
about it's like okay well you know we
could put in this feature and we know

00:09:46.769 --> 00:09:46.779
could put in this feature and we know
 

00:09:46.779 --> 00:09:49.079
could put in this feature and we know
like we leave money on the table short

00:09:49.079 --> 00:09:49.089
like we leave money on the table short
 

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:51.239
like we leave money on the table short
term money every day in the interest of

00:09:51.239 --> 00:09:51.249
term money every day in the interest of
 

00:09:51.249 --> 00:09:54.389
term money every day in the interest of
long-term money and that's the balance

00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399
long-term money and that's the balance
 

00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:57.569
long-term money and that's the balance
that we have to argue about in a healthy

00:09:57.569 --> 00:09:57.579
that we have to argue about in a healthy
 

00:09:57.579 --> 00:09:59.910
that we have to argue about in a healthy
way every day like okay look we know

00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920
way every day like okay look we know
 

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.039
way every day like okay look we know
this month you know we can make an extra

00:10:02.039 --> 00:10:02.049
this month you know we can make an extra
 

00:10:02.049 --> 00:10:05.039
this month you know we can make an extra
two million dollars but you know that's

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:05.049
two million dollars but you know that's
 

00:10:05.049 --> 00:10:06.689
two million dollars but you know that's
gonna lead to retention issues and

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:06.699
gonna lead to retention issues and
 

00:10:06.699 --> 00:10:08.699
gonna lead to retention issues and
that's actually not going to enrich

00:10:08.699 --> 00:10:08.709
that's actually not going to enrich
 

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:12.629
that's actually not going to enrich
their lives and we also make sure I mean

00:10:12.629 --> 00:10:12.639
their lives and we also make sure I mean
 

00:10:12.639 --> 00:10:15.119

the stuff that I'm most proud of is

00:10:15.119 --> 00:10:15.129
the stuff that I'm most proud of is
 

00:10:15.129 --> 00:10:18.059
the stuff that I'm most proud of is
actually the percentage of our payer

00:10:18.059 --> 00:10:18.069
actually the percentage of our payer
 

00:10:18.069 --> 00:10:21.269
actually the percentage of our payer
base so every day we have a million

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279
base so every day we have a million
 

00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:24.119
base so every day we have a million
women in the game and at any given point

00:10:24.119 --> 00:10:24.129
women in the game and at any given point
 

00:10:24.129 --> 00:10:26.159
women in the game and at any given point
forty percent of them have been payer

00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:26.169
forty percent of them have been payer
 

00:10:26.169 --> 00:10:31.169
forty percent of them have been payer
right so it's about having a broad and

00:10:31.169 --> 00:10:31.179
right so it's about having a broad and
 

00:10:31.179 --> 00:10:34.530
right so it's about having a broad and
engaged audience that doesn't pay a ton

they iterated on many many challenges
 

00:12:55.250 --> 00:13:00.550
they iterated on many many challenges
like 8 9 10 a day and they settled on

like 8 9 10 a day and they settled on
 

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.640
like 8 9 10 a day and they settled on
six and that was you know some science

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:03.650
six and that was you know some science
 

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.310
six and that was you know some science
and some some art because they didn't

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320
and some some art because they didn't
 

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.100

talk about it I mean like we could run
 

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.430
talk about it I mean like we could run
out many many many more challenges per

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:50.440
out many many many more challenges per
 

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.840
out many many many more challenges per
day now but we don't want to and this is

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:54.850
day now but we don't want to and this is

the design home team for advice and
 

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:32.980
the design home team for advice and
feedback all the time I think that you

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:32.990
feedback all the time I think that you

know covets a five-year-old product so
 

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.400
know covets a five-year-old product so
design home was really built kind of on

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:36.410
design home was really built kind of on
 

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:38.620
design home was really built kind of on
the on the back of what covet was and

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:38.630
the on the back of what covet was and
 

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.240
the on the back of what covet was and
took a lot of great learnings from it

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:40.250
took a lot of great learnings from it
 

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:42.370
took a lot of great learnings from it
but the teams work together all the time

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:42.380
but the teams work together all the time
 

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.770
but the teams work together all the time
we have the design home and the content

00:20:44.770 --> 00:20:44.780
we have the design home and the content
 

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.720
we have the design home and the content
team and the covet content team working

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:46.730
team and the covet content team working
 

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.730
team and the covet content team working
together learning from each other so I

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:48.740
together learning from each other so I
 

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:50.830
together learning from each other so I
