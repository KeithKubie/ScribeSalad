00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.140
KAI HALEY: Well, thank
you all for joining.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.390
Thank you so much for coming
here today to speak with us

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.890
with Barry O'Reilly.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.940
He is one of the authors
of "Lean Enterprise"

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.590
and has graciously agreed to
come talk to the Sprint Master

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.700
Academy about his ExecCamp,
which I'm very excited to hear

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.630
about, and the
work that he's been

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.930
doing to help organizations
transform and adopt change.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.380
Barry's going to start
with a quick presentation

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.080
about his work and his process.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.350
And then, We'll have a
fireside chat, some questions,

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.360
and we do have Adore
for those of you

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.730
who want to add questions
in there who are not here

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.405
in person.

00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:42.530
I'll hand it over to Barry.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.280
Thank you so much.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.420
BARRY O'REILLY: Thank you.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.260
ExecCamp, thank you very much.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.785
Every CEO briefing ever,
what do you think happens?

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.397
People come along.

00:00:57.397 --> 00:00:58.980
They listen to the
executive tell them

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.021
what they're going to do.

00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:02.442
What do the execs tell
them is going to happen?

00:01:02.442 --> 00:01:03.780
AUDIENCE: Big change.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.690
BARRY O'REILLY:
Big change, yeah.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.440
AUDIENCE: Everything's
going to be better.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.790
BARRY O'REILLY: Everything's
going to be better.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.331
That's right.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.940
The thing I hear every single
time is, we need to transform.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.517
We need to transform
our business.

00:01:18.517 --> 00:01:20.600
We need to change the way
that we're doing things.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.260
We need to innovate more.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.800
Now, when they say "we,"
who are they talking about?

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.587
Are they talking
about you or them?

00:01:31.587 --> 00:01:32.170
AUDIENCE: You.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.170
BARRY O'REILLY: Exactly.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.950
They're talking about you.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.949
We need to transform means them
saying, you need to transform.

00:01:38.949 --> 00:01:40.990
I'm just keep going to
keep doing the same things

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.070
that I've always done.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.720
Now 87%, that's the amount
of Fortune S&amp;P 500 companies

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.140
that have disappeared
since the last 20 years.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.350
Huge amount of churn in the
most highest performing,

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.430
highest grossing
companies on the planet.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.040
And unfortunately,
still today, the people

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.930
who are leading these companies
are advocating that they all

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.210
need to transform.

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.810
But they're not
transforming themselves.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.830
The way that half of
the S&amp;P 500 plan to grow

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.920
is by cost reduction activities.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.400
Only 32% of them plan to grow
by new products and services.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.680
What I have been
experiencing when

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.640
we were writing
"Lean Enterprise"

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.930
and talking to a lot of
these large organizations

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.610
about what they were struggling
with, how to drive innovation

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.120
in their entire
enterprise, we started

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.400
to understand that the
problem isn't actually

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.350
the people in the company.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.240
They want to change.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.070
They want to try new things.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.870
But unfortunately,
the leadership,

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.399
the people who are
running the company,

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:51.940
are struggling to
actually understand

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.397
how to drive that change
themselves and transform

00:02:55.397 --> 00:02:55.896
themselves.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.390
I decided it was time
to create a new model,

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.990
a new model for driving
change in large enterprises.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.310
And this is why we
invented ExecCamp.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.140
What I do in ExecCamp is
I get senior executives

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.650
from large, multibillion
dollar organizations

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.740
to leave their company
for four to eight weeks

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.808
with the goal of launching
new businesses to disrupt

00:03:25.808 --> 00:03:27.016
their existing organizations.

00:03:29.658 --> 00:03:31.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.210
That's right.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:39.460
CEOs, CFOs, heads of technology
leaving their existing company

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.910
for almost two months to try and
launch new companies to blow up

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.010
their existing business.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.250
BARRY O'REILLY: Sound like fun?

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.380
BARRY O'REILLY:
Does it sound crazy?

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.460
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.890
BARRY O'REILLY: Great.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:53.390
It is.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.510
Because it's awesome.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.230
Because what we're
trying to create

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.340
is an environment where
executives can actually

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.430
get out of their comfort zone.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.040
They actually
understand what it's

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.250
like to get back at the
front line of innovation,

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.090
to understand the challenges
about what's going out there.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.740
I also want them
to learn by doing.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.370
They've read every management
book under the sun.

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.070
They look at models like
Build-Measure-Learn and say,

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.750
we're doing that.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.190
But it's very different to
actually go through a learning

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.370
cycle than to look at it on
paper and how easy it is to do.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.010
I get them back to understand
how to learn by doing,

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.550
by actually experiencing
innovation at the front line.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.900
They also then, at the
end of the eight weeks,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.680
go back to the organization
as coaches for other people,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.780
so they can start to
understand the challenges

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.710
that their people are
facing on the front line

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.380
and coach them how
to do experimentation

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.410
and learning better.

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:58.540
Now, they also get to
test lots of ideas.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.240
In order to come up
with a good idea,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.580
you have to have lots of ideas,
generate optionality and test

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.240
all those options to find
out which is the best signal

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.139
and invest in it more.

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:10.680
But the challenge
in large corporates

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.350
is, because of the
funding cycles involved

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.910
in getting initiatives to start,
they can potentially only make

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.600
one or two bets a year.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.880
And they're massive bets.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.350
They take multi-year to deliver.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.070
They always get half
of what they want.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.570
They're always twice
as long as they

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.630
thought they'd be and
cost four times the amount

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.760
that they planned.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.250
But that's a feedback cycle
in a large organization,

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.000
potentially one to
two years before you

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.680
get feedback on your idea.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.780
What I'm showing them is
how they can get feedback

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.620
in a minute, in a
second, how they

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.080
can test those options
to understand what works,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.490
what doesn't, kill
things early, invest

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.690
and double down on what works.

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.570
And then finally,
the ultimate benefit

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:58.160
is when they leave their
company for these eight weeks,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.500
it gives the
safe-to-fail experiment

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.420
for the next
generation of leaders

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:08.100
to take the role of
the CEO, of the CTO,

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.840
for a short period of time and
get experience, understanding,

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.450
what it's like to have that role
in a multimillion, 10, 100,000

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.280
person, type company for
a short period of time

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.240
and learn what it's
like to do that.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.390
Anybody want to do it?

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.086
Sound like fun?

00:06:29.086 --> 00:06:29.710
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:30.209
Let's do it.

00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:32.860
BARRY O'REILLY: Let's do it.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:34.754
Normally, at this
stage, it goes two ways.

00:06:34.754 --> 00:06:36.420
When I sit down with
the executive team,

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:37.890
there either go, that's amazing.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:38.930
We're going to do it.

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.310
Or they go, you're crazy.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.870
Get the hell out of here.

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:46.740
And I'm lucky to say I get
kicked out of plenty of rooms.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.200
But by, I think, the people who
are the visionary leaders, who

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.430
understand that the nature
of the environment we're in

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.210
is about complexity,
it's about change,

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.440
and you need to embrace both and
find ways to experiment, to do

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.700
things radically different to
drive your business forward,

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.690
they're the people
who ask me to stay.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:08.230
And they're the
kind of people who

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.910
are going to lead
their organizations

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.290
through these transformations.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.840
Because it's difficult. There's
a high amount of uncertainty.

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.960
And this is why
experimentation is so key.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.560
But before you do
all these things,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.260
these are why things
like techniques

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.470
that I use like Design
Thinking, like Lean Startup,

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.460
and applying them to the
enterprise principles

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.290
are so important.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.470
Getting people,
cross-functional groups,

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.620
in a room to work together
to solve big problems.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.920
And I love this
diagram that was given

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.200
to me by a guy
called Jeff Patton,

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.050
and also shared with me
by another guy called

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.660
Luke Barrett.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.080
And I love this idea
of the three characters

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.900
are like, yeah, we all agree.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:56.610
But someone's thinking
about a circle.

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:58.400
Someone's thinking
about a square.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.120
Someone's thinking about
a different type of shape.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.330
But we all agree.

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.860
We think we agree.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.140
And then we say, well,
let's visualize that.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:13.420
Let's externalize our thoughts
and put them up on a wall.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:15.160
And then, suddenly,
I know that Kai's

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.900
thinking about a triangle.

00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:18.980
I'm thinking about a circle.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.490
That's probably
not the same thing.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.520
And you can see the genesis
here of what Design Thinking is

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.280
about, Lean about, visualizing
what you are thinking about,

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.000
and using models to
externalize our thoughts,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.820
debate what we're trying to
solve, come to a consensus,

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.710
and execute and test
that experiment.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:45.500
And all the methods I use
through these processes

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.320
are embracing those
principles of experimentation,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.220
of visualization, and
testing and learning.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.800
Now, just before anyone
thinks I'm too crazy,

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.890
there's one other thing
I always have to show.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:58.990
People are like, this is great.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.115
This is really interesting.

00:09:00.115 --> 00:09:01.290
But how does it work?

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.650
And it's OK.

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:04.580
Because I've got a
diagram that wiggles

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.830
but goes up and to the right.

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:10.660
So managers feel safe.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:17.210
But really what I do, innovation
needs to be structured.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.705
You need to deliberately
practice experimentation.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.840
Having an outline for
methods that we'll go through

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:28.850
is really important
so people understand

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.100
how they're going
to contribute, what

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.602
is expected of them
at different stages,

00:09:33.602 --> 00:09:35.310
and what we're going
to actually achieve.

00:09:38.222 --> 00:09:39.430
This is the framework we use.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:40.720
We talk about Prepare.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.460
And it says, Plan, Educate,
and Ready the Team.

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:46.620
Senior executives in
large, multibillion dollar

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:48.590
organizations have no time.

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:49.470
No spare time.

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.280
They're booked up for
three months in advance.

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.110
What I start to do is create
a lightweight intervention

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:56.810
program with them.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.900
In the lead-up to
taking the ExecCamp,

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.810
I'll spend one hour
a week with them

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.670
where I'll introduce
them to certain models

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.450
that we might use, maybe
personas, maybe business model

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:08.750
canvases, maybe value
proposition canvases.

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:10.500
They start to understand
some of the tools

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.100
that they're going to be
using, everything from simply

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:16.140
how to peel a Post-it
and why we use Sharpies

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.420
right through to very complex
ways of describing business

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.940
models that they can test.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.610
I also do psychoanalogy
work with them,

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:30.970
helping them understand that
Barry's an abstract thinker,

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:33.740
doesn't really enjoy
detail, would be good for

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:36.580
vision, terrible for execution.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.180
But then Kai is probably
amazing at detail-oriented

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:42.500
and execution.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.250
You have to build context
about these teams.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:48.600
Because when they come together
for a short period of time,

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.870
you don't have time to sit
around and wait for everybody

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.180
to understand and work together.

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:56.230
You're trying to
reduce the uncertainty

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.570
of having a high performance
team from day one.

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:01.120
Build models that
people can share

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.700
context about one another,
both their biases,

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.810
their preferences, and
their capabilities.

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:11.790
We can understand quickly have
we the right mix of a team?

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.412
Can we create
psychological safety?

00:11:14.412 --> 00:11:16.370
Again, something that's
come from the Aristotle

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.209
Project here at Google.

00:11:19.209 --> 00:11:20.750
And then, can you
give them the tools

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:24.060
that they're going to need
to help them be successful?

00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.970
Prime them.

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:27.850
The Immerse stage, then,
is getting them out

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.560
of their comfort zone.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.940
Most executives can only
see what's in front of them.

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:34.570
Every idea that
they have or issue

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.160
that they have in
the company, they've

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.630
got a point solution to fix it.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:41.780
When you ask them to
think bigger, all they do

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:43.300
is come up with
the idea that they

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:44.910
think is going to
fix the business,

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.980
but they couldn't get it
funded for five years.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.580
It's very hard to stick
people in a room for two days

00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.720
and tell them,
change the business,

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.720
and then sit in this
room for three days

00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.720
and we'll change the business.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.947
Innovation doesn't
necessarily happen in rooms.

00:12:01.947 --> 00:12:03.530
It happens where the
work's happening,

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:05.930
where people see problems.

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.452
You need to help open their mind
to what's happening externally,

00:12:09.452 --> 00:12:11.660
go and see what other
technology companies are doing,

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:16.070
startups are doing, interesting
competitors are doing.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.690
But then, also understand the
assets that your business has,

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:22.240
the capabilities yours has,
and how you can leverage them.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.320
Bring the best of both worlds.

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.340
Large corporates are
large because they

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.610
have a business model and
capabilities that work well.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.600
If you can leverage those in
a new and interesting way,

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.080
either with partnerships or
to open innovation frameworks,

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:39.490
you can create something
even more better.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:41.490
Ideate, then, is basically
ways that we generate

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:43.340
tons and tons of ideas.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:47.320
We use those inputs to help
us understand lots of options.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.960
And then testing everything.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.150
The thing we always
optimize for is

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.800
testing as many
ideas as possible,

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:59.800
constantly generating
new inputs,

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.360
but then getting the
executives to go and talk

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.527
to the customers
about these ideas

00:13:04.527 --> 00:13:06.360
that they've mapped out
themselves, or built

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.030
simple prototypes for.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.792
And get feedback to
understand if it works or not.

00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:13.500
Now, this is the most
uncomfortable thing

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.850
for executives that
they could ever do.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:20.070
One of my favorite stories
from doing this is I

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:22.580
had the CTO of one of
the largest airline

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.590
companies on the planet.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.210
And he had a great
idea that he was

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:28.016
like, we just found this idea.

00:13:28.016 --> 00:13:29.390
We're going to
save the business.

00:13:29.390 --> 00:13:30.460
It's going to be amazing.

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:32.300
And I was like, brilliant.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:32.800
OK.

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.970
We'll just sketch it out.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.880
Let's make a prototype.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.430
Let's go talk to
customers about it.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:41.736
Sat down, showed the
idea to a customer.

00:13:41.736 --> 00:13:42.860
What do you think happened?

00:13:45.074 --> 00:13:46.740
AUDIENCE: Customer
didn't understand it?

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:50.270
BARRY O'REILLY: The customer
didn't understand it.

00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:55.084
What do you think the reaction
of this person, the CTO, was?

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:57.085
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
how they do it.

00:13:57.085 --> 00:13:59.460
BARRY O'REILLY: How could the
customer not understand it?

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:00.030
Yes.

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:00.930
Dumb customer.

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:02.400
Silly customer.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.600
Bring me the next one.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.100
So we brought another customer.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:09.370
And we sat the customer down.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:15.880
And the executive again showed
the idea to the silly customer.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.700
What do you think
happened again?

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.950
Same thing happened again.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:21.380
Bring me another customer.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.510
They're just--

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.387
But eventually, the
message got through

00:14:26.387 --> 00:14:28.970
that they started to understand
that the people that they were

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.870
designing for didn't
understand what they

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:34.920
were trying to communicate.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.370
And they could
start to understand

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:40.200
that the value of testing
that hypothesis, that idea,

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.900
that prototype,
with the customer

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.740
was the best mechanism that they
would have for getting feedback

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:50.680
to make a better
decision or improve it.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:54.500
And I'm delighted to say
that that person is probably

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:57.740
one of the most transformative
characters as a result

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.370
of this mechanism that
they changed everything

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:01.592
that the way they worked.

00:15:01.592 --> 00:15:03.730
They saw everything
as an experiment

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:05.585
from new products
and the processes

00:15:05.585 --> 00:15:09.539
they designed, the strategy
that they've designed.

00:15:09.539 --> 00:15:11.080
And this is really
important for when

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.730
you're trying to help people
go through and understand

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.810
and start to learn.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:18.540
You have to create
an environment where

00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:22.630
they test their mental model of
the world and make a discovery.

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.670
Learn something new about it.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:28.010
And that's what prototyping
and experimentation is about.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:31.140
How can I put my idea
out there specifically

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.160
with the people
it's designed for

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.860
and get feedback to see
does it work or not?

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.700
I'm testing my
assumptions of the world.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:41.690
And by using that
mechanism, I've

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:45.230
discovered that that's the best
way to drive change in people.

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.550
It's very difficult
for you to tell me

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:50.800
why Design Thinking is
the way I should work.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.060
Create an experiment where
I get to use Design Thinking

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:56.880
and see the benefits
of it rather than

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.660
just listen to your opinion.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:01.590
Help me experience
it so then I change

00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:03.540
my mental model of the world.

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:05.860
Really important.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:09.830
And then finally, with the
Impact and Scale pieces,

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.480
when you've tested
all these great ideas,

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.800
the best people to bring
them back into the company

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.989
and try and drive them forward
are the executives themselves.

00:16:17.989 --> 00:16:19.155
They understand bureaucracy.

00:16:19.155 --> 00:16:21.990
They understand how
to drive initiative

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:25.491
through the organization using
the culture and the practice

00:16:25.491 --> 00:16:26.990
and the principles
that they've used

00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:32.080
in ExecCamp to keep propagating
and scaling that idea out.

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.260
And then, my goal is always
to try and teach people

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:36.770
how to run these themselves.

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:39.890
I talk about see one,
do one, teach one.

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:42.545
The first time the executives
come to an ExecCamp,

00:16:42.545 --> 00:16:43.170
they're seeing.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.320
It's the first time
that they do it.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.250
What I try to encourage
them next time

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:52.520
is that they coach other people
to see it for the first time.

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:56.360
And they start to do,
or lead, one themselves.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.800
Finally then that they start
to teach it to other people

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:01.930
in the organization,
which creates the ability

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.599
to scale it.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:06.890
I've been doing this
for nearly a year now.

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:07.970
It's been pretty amazing.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:10.250
I've had lots of
great experiences.

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:14.060
I've run it for one of the
largest airlines in the world.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:15.829
I've done it for one
of the largest cargo

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:17.430
companies in the world.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.197
I was in JFK airport
last week actually

00:17:20.197 --> 00:17:22.530
helping them transform the
way that they actually design

00:17:22.530 --> 00:17:23.901
and build airports.

00:17:23.901 --> 00:17:26.109
This has been one the most
interesting and intriguing

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:28.040
things I've ever done.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:32.650
And the people who have
been through this process,

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.450
it's fundamentally changing the
way that they see the world.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:39.050
It's transformative
for them in many ways.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:41.270
What I'm going to share
today, and I hope we can,

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.880
through lots of
questions and debate

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.950
about what we've
been doing, is just

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:50.260
talk about how do you drive
large scale transformation

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.880
in multibillion
dollar organizations

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.860
and get successful results
using the methods like Design

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:59.700
Thinking, Lean Startup,
and experimentation

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.900
to create high
performance at scale,

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.270
test lots of great
ideas, but have

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.570
a cultural impact
in organizations

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.019
that they constantly
embrace these principles

00:18:09.019 --> 00:18:10.060
and constantly transform.

00:18:12.881 --> 00:18:13.755
KAI HALEY: Thank you.

00:18:13.755 --> 00:18:16.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:17.279 --> 00:18:18.320
Thank you so much, Barry.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:18.380
BARRY O'REILLY: Yup.

00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:20.675
KAI HALEY: That was really
fascinating to hear about.

00:18:23.736 --> 00:18:26.170
One of the goals of the
Sprint Master Academy

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:32.370
is to do similar work and
train a large number of Sprint

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:37.070
Masters to create
opportunities for innovation

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.620
and transformation
across Google.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:42.670
We have a lot of adoption of
our Design Sprint Methodology

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:44.030
already.

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:46.640
But Sprint Masters
are still tasked

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:51.080
with convincing
stakeholders and leadership

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:57.230
to buy into the Sprint
process and to run sprints.

00:18:57.230 --> 00:19:01.610
Do you have any advice for
this group of Sprint Masters,

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:05.520
in terms of
persuading leadership

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.010
to adopt innovation
methods and to make

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:11.435
room and space for innovation?

00:19:11.435 --> 00:19:12.310
BARRY O'REILLY: Yeah.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:17.000
I think there's a few parts
to unpick in the question.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.410
I think convincing
executives that they

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:22.740
need to do innovation is
not a hard sell these days.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.240
Right?

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.560
They see companies that
existed four or five

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.170
years ago just disappearing.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:31.460
They are in their
organization struggling

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.620
to see how can we
bring new ideas to life

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.540
and how do we do that?

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:39.230
I think they understand
that they need to do it.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.990
The big challenge is they
don't know how to do it.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:43.810
Because a lot of
large corporates

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.410
have become massively
large because they

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:48.590
have maybe one business
model, or one product

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:50.720
that make them
massively successful.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:55.330
And their whole business has
just been tuning that one idea,

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.440
extract a [INAUDIBLE] from it.

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.900
And then, when you
ask them to say well,

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.020
keep optimizing what
you've got, but now you've

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.890
got to find a new thing.

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:07.400
They're like, well, this isn't
a natural competency, or scale,

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.410
or reflex that we
have as a business.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:12.760
They know they need to do it.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.400
But they don't
know how to do it.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:18.420
I think this is where things
like the Sprint Design

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:22.680
process advocated by Google
and lots of companies

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.290
using Design Thinking
methodologies

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:26.350
is really, really important.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:29.860
Because very quickly,
in lightweight ways,

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:32.810
you can help and
show executives ways

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:34.780
that they can make discoveries.

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.360
They are interested about
discovering new information

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:41.870
about their business, their
product, customers have to say.

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:43.780
What I would always
encourage you to do

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:48.550
is rather than keep trying
to sell the process of we've

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:51.880
got this amazing
process, try and create

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.390
a very simple and small
experience for them

00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:59.230
where they get to see the
benefit of using that process.

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:02.830
You almost don't want to
tell them what you're doing.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:06.830
You want to sort of say to them,
OK, what's one of the problems

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.930
that you're really struggling
with at the moment?

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:10.540
All right.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.450
How could we quickly
map that problem out?

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:14.500
We could use a canvas.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.001
Or we could describe
it in a journey.

00:21:17.001 --> 00:21:17.500
OK.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.824
Where's the most
uncertainty in this process?

00:21:19.824 --> 00:21:21.990
Where are we having difficulty,
challenge, friction,

00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:24.700
whatever it might be?

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.850
How could we learn
something that would help

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:28.400
us reduce that uncertainty?

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:31.480
What little test could
we go and run and do?

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.370
Maybe we need to go and talk to
a customer about this process

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:37.160
we're trying to change.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.730
Make them go and do that.

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:42.059
And then, it's almost like
in the reflecting periods,

00:21:42.059 --> 00:21:44.350
you're like, well, we've just
done some Design Thinking

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:46.010
activities there.

00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:47.620
Because they'll
go and experience

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:49.590
this idea of just
trying something new,

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:51.640
working in a different way.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.920
I think we're all confident
to say that anytime

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.390
you talk to a customer,
any time you test an idea,

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.420
you always learn something.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.670
Once you can create
that simple experience,

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:04.250
it's a small experiment.

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:08.150
They can carve out a short
bit of their time to do it,

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:09.990
but they'll learn the benefits.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:12.490
They'll experience it, and
learn something, and go,

00:22:12.490 --> 00:22:13.830
this is great.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.550
How can I do more?

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:18.465
And it's selling itself
then at that stage.

00:22:18.465 --> 00:22:20.590
Then you can start to unpack
it and say, well, this

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.080
is the methods
that we use to help

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.990
explore uncertainty
and understand

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.406
ambiguity and so forth.

00:22:26.406 --> 00:22:27.530
But they've experienced it.

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:30.370
So they've something to talk to.

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:32.700
The hard part is when you're
just constantly saying,

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.019
look at this process we do.

00:22:34.019 --> 00:22:34.560
Look at this.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.560
Here, look at this great
diagram of our process.

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:37.710
Isn't it so much fun?

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.000
It looks awesome.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.170
Everybody does this.

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.850
When you're a leader
in an organization,

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:46.920
everybody's trying to sell
you on their thing, why

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:51.280
their thing is awesome, and if
you just invested in our thing,

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.760
you would be awesome too.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.170
I think the trick is just
creating experiences for people

00:22:57.170 --> 00:22:59.520
just like you do when
you design things.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.410
Because experience
is what helps people

00:23:01.410 --> 00:23:03.340
challenge their mental
model and assumptions

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.580
and builds context of something.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:09.292
That's what I always
try to do when I start.

00:23:09.292 --> 00:23:10.250
KAI HALEY: Interesting.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:11.400
Yeah.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:15.510
We find that at Google, we like
to do these small experiments

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:18.310
to show impact.

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:23.300
But being able to
demonstrate that impact,

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.631
speak about that impact
in a language that's

00:23:25.631 --> 00:23:27.380
really valuable to
leadership is something

00:23:27.380 --> 00:23:31.450
that we're learning
and developing.

00:23:31.450 --> 00:23:35.090
In terms of stakeholder
participation,

00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:38.420
we often struggle to get
stakeholders to actually

00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:41.210
participate in this process.

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:45.370
And we find that
it can be valuable,

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:49.500
but actually getting people
to dedicate the time, have you

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.360
found, is there
any particular way

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:58.180
of talking about the process
that helps to help show

00:23:58.180 --> 00:23:59.670
how valuable that time will be?

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:02.400
BARRY O'REILLY: That's a perfect
[INAUDIBLE] question again.

00:24:04.897 --> 00:24:06.730
I was showing a little
bit of the high level

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:11.850
process of what we use when
we're working in ExecCamp.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:15.030
One of the most important
things that came out

00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:20.200
of the whole Agile movement was
when they had Agile ceremonies,

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:24.030
you're very explicit about
the purpose of that ceremony.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:26.960
What type of conversation
is going to happen there?

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:30.240
What input or feedback you
expect to happen, and how

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.200
that will inform you
to take your next step.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.660
Just to simplify, an
Agile team standup,

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.240
that's a chance for them to
solve ambiguity from the day

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.210
before.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:41.412
Here's a problem we had.

00:24:41.412 --> 00:24:42.370
I might need your help.

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:44.720
Can you spare four hours to
work with me this afternoon,

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.586
or tomorrow, or
whatever, on that?

00:24:47.586 --> 00:24:49.210
People would share
context and move on.

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:50.130
It happens every day.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:51.510
Great.

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:54.350
Maybe at the end of
iteration as an Agile team,

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:57.250
they'd bring all the work that
they've learned for the month,

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:59.042
or whatever, the week,
or whatever it was.

00:24:59.042 --> 00:25:01.000
And then, they'd share
that to another audience

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.110
and say, give us
feedback on that.

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:05.890
But all those ceremonies, it
is very clear about what's

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:08.610
going to happen, who
needs to be there,

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.590
what decisions are
going to be made,

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.930
and how you're going
to input to that.

00:25:12.930 --> 00:25:15.860
Now executives, especially
of multimillion dollar

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:18.649
organizations, don't
have a lot of time.

00:25:18.649 --> 00:25:19.815
Their time is very precious.

00:25:19.815 --> 00:25:21.910
It's very valuable.

00:25:21.910 --> 00:25:25.850
And a lot of the
time, you've got

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:29.210
to design a working
system to fit in

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.240
with what the type of schedule
they're going to have.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:35.170
Like with ExecCamp, it
takes us in the region

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:37.760
between three to six months
to get time in their diary

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.880
to actually clear
a couple of weeks

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.980
that they can go and do this.

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.250
And some of the executives,
what works really well

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:48.086
for them is we do two
hours in the morning,

00:25:48.086 --> 00:25:49.210
two hours in the afternoon.

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:49.710
Right?

00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:52.470
10:00 to 12:00, 2:00 to 4:00.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.492
In those sessions,
it's very explicit

00:25:54.492 --> 00:25:55.700
what we're going to be doing.

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.750
It's very deliberate
about the practices

00:25:57.750 --> 00:26:00.020
that we're going to make
and use, the decisions we

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:01.140
want to make.

00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.630
They're going into
those sessions

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:07.840
primed because you have to
make the most of every second.

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.330
You do that for
four or five days.

00:26:09.330 --> 00:26:11.580
And they know that they'll
do it for four or five days

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.590
and then they'll
put it all together

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:16.450
and showcase it at the end of
the day to other stakeholders.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:19.350
It's very, very disciplined.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:20.420
And it's structured.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.480
And it's clear to them.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.660
Roles and responsibilities
are very clear.

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:28.320
You have to be very conscious
about explaining that

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.030
to senior leadership.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:34.480
Because their time is, so
many people competing for it,

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.620
you've got to show
why it's important,

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:38.120
what they're going
to get out of it,

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:41.500
and how to leverage it
as quickly as possible.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.190
KAI HALEY: Yes.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:46.484
AUDIENCE: Barry, you use
the term "they" a lot.

00:26:46.484 --> 00:26:48.944
Is it one-on-one for them?

00:26:48.944 --> 00:26:50.360
KAI HALEY: Just
use the microphone

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.788
so we can be sure to hear it.

00:26:51.788 --> 00:26:55.463
AUDIENCE: You use the
term "they" a lot.

00:26:55.463 --> 00:26:57.120
Is it mainly
one-on-one training?

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.685
Or is it actually
a group activity?

00:26:59.685 --> 00:27:00.560
BARRY O'REILLY: Yeah.

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.426
It's a group.

00:27:01.426 --> 00:27:03.425
Generally, we try to
create a cross-functional--

00:27:03.425 --> 00:27:05.210
AUDIENCE: Can you repeat
the question, briefly?

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.720
BARRY O'REILLY: Oh, sorry.

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.520
OK.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.200
The question was
during ExecCamp,

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.820
is it just one-on-one training?

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.840
Or something else?

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:15.880
And the answer is,
it's something else.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:18.150
Thank you for correcting me.

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.770
What I try to do is create
a cross-functional group

00:27:20.770 --> 00:27:23.280
from across the entire business.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.920
I don't necessarily
just want technology.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:30.640
It's the CFO, chief financial
officer, the head of sales,

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.680
the head of marketing,
the head of HR.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.492
And I get them to form
a cross-functional team.

00:27:36.492 --> 00:27:37.950
Because you need
to fight the silos

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:41.480
that naturally exist
in large corporates.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.270
Putting them in
rooms with designers,

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:45.460
with developers, and
so forth, so people

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.600
who can rapidly take
the ideas that they have

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.990
and turn them into
substance to be tested.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:52.090
Might be a prototype,
might be a wireframe,

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:54.360
might be working software,
depending on the investment

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.800
you want to make.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.910
So this group live, act,
and breathe together

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:04.150
for the entire duration
of the program.

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:07.190
And that, in itself, is a great
learning experience for them.

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:11.460
Because they don't actually get
to work together very often.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.930
And you're also deciding
trade-offs and sharing

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:15.920
a lot of contents very quickly.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.690
Because someone, say, in
the technology department

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.100
might have a really
great idea that's

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.840
going to change the business.

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:26.280
But your CFO can very quickly
identify, potentially,

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:29.320
the total cost of bringing
that thing to life

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:34.030
that might not necessarily be
the avenue you want to go down.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:37.470
I saw that a few times when we
did some of the Exec campuses,

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.880
very quickly what you
find is technologists

00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:44.760
just want to throw technology
to solve the problem.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:47.870
We're trying to build
another food delivery app.

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:50.210
Oh, yeah, we'll just
machine learn it.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:52.040
What the hell?

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.760
Yeah, machine learning
will fix that.

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:58.050
They just throw these
arbitrary comments out there.

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.010
But what you get in a
cross-functional team

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:02.280
is the marketing
person will say, well,

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.410
how will our
customers understand

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:05.530
what this idea is about?

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:07.740
The finance person will
be like, all right, well,

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.920
what would be our potential
revenue return from this?

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.660
It's just a different
set of questions

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:16.450
that start to emerge rather
than, hey, I've got a problem.

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:17.940
This technology will solve it.

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.314
Let's go build it.

00:29:19.314 --> 00:29:20.980
And that's one of the
benefits of having

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:22.340
a cross-functional group.

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:27.360
Vice versa, you'll have a lot
of traditional, less exciting,

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:29.820
design-creative people
like finance coming up

00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.012
with some really quite
intriguing ideas.

00:29:32.012 --> 00:29:33.970
And that's what you're
really trying to create.

00:29:36.597 --> 00:29:37.305
KAI HALEY: Great.

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:44.530
One of the other channels that
a lot of Sprint Masters have

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:49.260
is supporting the work
after the initial ideation

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:51.220
process, or that
initial Design Sprint,

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:54.780
and figuring out,
planning the paths

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.460
to launch for their products.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:03.290
Is there any advice you can
give on continual support

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:06.770
for execution post that
initial Design Thinking work?

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:08.060
BARRY O'REILLY: Yes.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:12.980
The very first ExecCamp we
ran, we did eight weeks.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.026
We came up with four
transformation ideas.

00:30:15.026 --> 00:30:16.650
They were going to
change the business.

00:30:16.650 --> 00:30:18.160
It was brilliant.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.790
And then, we brought them
back into the company

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:22.430
and they all died.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:24.285
They died, literally,
within two weeks--

00:30:24.285 --> 00:30:24.910
KAI HALEY: Wow.

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:27.285
BARRY O'REILLY: --which was
pretty impressive, I thought.

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:30.810
That was a great
learning for us.

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:35.290
Because we thought by having
the energy, the enthusiasm,

00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:38.040
we had the leadership, they were
going to bring these ideas back

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.590
to the company.

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.800
And what they stopped doing
was living and breathing

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:44.620
and working in
the same practices

00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.317
that I had used before,
sitting down every week

00:30:47.317 --> 00:30:49.650
and setting a goal for what
we're going to try and learn

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:52.840
this week, constantly
reevaluating the larger

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.266
vision and the steps that we
were going to do to achieve

00:30:55.266 --> 00:30:56.890
that vision, not just
in the next week,

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:00.160
but the next week, the next
month, the next three months.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.790
That all just stopped.

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:04.469
They just went back to
their business as usual,

00:31:04.469 --> 00:31:06.260
which was, oh, we've
got these great ideas.

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.280
Now, we'll just put them into
our usual development process

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.370
where they can go to die
slowly and painfully.

00:31:14.702 --> 00:31:16.160
That was one of
the great learnings

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:19.260
for us is that you actually
have to, again, design

00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.050
that type of governance
process into what

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:25.460
happens when you come back into
the company with these ideas.

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:30.310
Because people who are working
on the typical BAU business,

00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:33.450
they'll often go, oh, you're
just off dreaming up new stuff.

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:35.320
I've got 100 other
things I need to do.

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.070
Why should I pick up
the thing that you're

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:39.140
going to come back and work on?

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.570
I think having a very
clear governance structure

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:44.860
about, right, the ideas have
come back, we've tested them,

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:47.050
this is what we've
learned, our next learning

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:49.790
goal for the next week is x.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:52.150
In a month, we need
to be looking at y.

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:54.130
Our bigger vision
beyond that is--

00:31:54.130 --> 00:31:56.760
And then, keep using
the iterative approach

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:59.900
of having sessions organized
with your stakeholders

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.729
where you are constantly
showcasing what you're learning

00:32:02.729 --> 00:32:05.270
from the experiments that you've
agreed to run for that week,

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:07.250
for that month,
whatever they might be.

00:32:07.250 --> 00:32:09.720
And keep the heartbeat going.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.220
If you don't design
that into the process,

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:14.900
and people don't sign
up to that while they

00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:19.230
are part of the Design
Sprint process, you're dead.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.830
Just don't even waste your time
on Day one after the sprint.

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:24.120
You need to have owners.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.400
You need to have actions.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:27.070
You need to have a plan.

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.690
And build that
plan aim get people

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:31.550
to commit to it because
if you don't, you've

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.272
just wasted a sprint.

00:32:33.272 --> 00:32:34.980
AUDIENCE: Is it OK,
a follow-up question?

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:35.740
KAI HALEY: Yes, yes.

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:36.710
BARRY O'REILLY: Keep asking.

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:37.030
Please.

00:32:37.030 --> 00:32:38.210
It's for the room, yeah.

00:32:41.727 --> 00:32:43.435
AUDIENCE: I have
experienced that myself.

00:32:43.435 --> 00:32:46.830
Great ideas die a
very slow death.

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:50.092
Has there ever been talked about
during those sessions that you

00:32:50.092 --> 00:32:56.561
had with those executives in
changing the incentive in model

00:32:56.561 --> 00:32:58.946
to the reward
system that exists?

00:32:58.946 --> 00:33:01.250
A lot of times,
tech organizations

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:08.324
arrive on launch, literally
like notches in the belt.

00:33:08.324 --> 00:33:09.925
But has that changed?

00:33:09.925 --> 00:33:10.800
BARRY O'REILLY: Yeah.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:11.810
That's a great question.

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:13.182
Do I repeat that again?

00:33:13.182 --> 00:33:13.890
AUDIENCE: Please.

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:17.650
BARRY O'REILLY: The question
was although when you come back

00:33:17.650 --> 00:33:21.130
with these great ideas, is
there a conflict, basically,

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:24.030
with the existing
performance management

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:29.530
KPIs of an operating business
to not invest in these ideas?

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:33.210
And the simple answer
is yes there is.

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:37.180
And it has a bias
on the behaviors

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:38.400
that it will drive in people.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.000
And it will also have a bias
on them, individuals, right?

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.930
They're told certain
metrics that they

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:46.220
have to hit all the time.

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:50.930
Now, the problem here is
most large organizations

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:54.070
have used the same
standard set of KPIs

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:58.450
used to run their business,
most of them from inception.

00:33:58.450 --> 00:34:01.960
A lot of the classic
KPIs that are associated

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.100
with operating businesses--

00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:07.274
And I just want to make a
distinction between what

00:34:07.274 --> 00:34:08.690
a business model
or product that's

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:11.040
existed for a period
of time and they

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.750
have lots of data
to understand how

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:16.239
it performs versus an
experimental idea which

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:17.320
where it's a new idea.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:19.639
You've very little data
about the performance.

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:21.159
It's no history.

00:34:21.159 --> 00:34:23.520
They're totally
different things.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:27.239
Yet, the prevailing methodology
for managing the performance

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:31.060
of any initiative is
all based on products

00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:32.960
that existed for a long time.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:37.199
Classic examples are revenue
or return on investment.

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:40.110
We've invested 5 million in
this product for 10 years.

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:43.600
And we know that we're going to
make a million dollars a year

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.770
as a result of that.

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:48.050
They have the data to
inform that decision.

00:34:48.050 --> 00:34:51.100
When you're working in a highly
uncertain and experimental type

00:34:51.100 --> 00:34:53.900
environment, you have no data.

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.380
You have to invest to find out.

00:34:56.380 --> 00:34:58.290
That's the whole point
of running experiments

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:02.830
and why you want to run
small, cheap, fast experiments

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:07.320
is you want tight feedback
loops to generate data to help

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.370
you make a better decision.

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:12.270
When you come up
with a new product,

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:15.260
the reason you want to
talk to 10 customers

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:17.480
and define how
many customers have

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:19.750
to like the idea for
you before you progress

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:22.330
it, before you run the
experiment, is you're

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:23.800
trying to create a test.

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:26.650
You're trying to create a
loose set of KPIs to say,

00:35:26.650 --> 00:35:29.480
seven out of 10 customers
don't like this idea.

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:32.320
We're going to say we're going
to make a different decision.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:34.940
We're going to kill it.

00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:37.560
That's how you're using
your loose set of KPIs

00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:38.500
to make decisions.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.510
And that's called
Innovation Accounting.

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:42.740
And it was popularized in
the "Lean Startup" book

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.850
by Eric Ries.

00:35:44.850 --> 00:35:47.450
But when you start to
actually then bring

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:51.570
executives and finance
people into this world,

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:53.190
you have to show
them that there is

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:55.830
a method to what you're doing.

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:59.250
Just saying that I'm going
to disappear off and innovate

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:03.140
and not hold myself accountable
to any sort of decision

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:06.290
making framework
is not acceptable.

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:09.370
But when you sit down and
explain to them to say, look,

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:11.484
we don't, it's highly uncertain.

00:36:11.484 --> 00:36:13.650
But we're going to test
this idea with 10 customers.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:17.440
And if seven of them like it,
we're going to keep going.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:20.840
Does that sound like
a good test to you?

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.690
They will engage
straight away and they'll

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:25.800
understand that you're
not just going crazy here.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.690
You're very deliberate.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:30.400
You have a clear
method and a way

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:34.650
to make decisions in conditions
of extreme uncertainty.

00:36:34.650 --> 00:36:36.080
That's what innovation is about.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:37.996
And if you can build
those skills into the way

00:36:37.996 --> 00:36:40.060
that you work,
that's where you can

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:43.010
start to bring them on their
transformational experience

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:47.190
to understand why you're doing
things, why you can't talk

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:51.640
about ROI on an idea that you've
only tested with one person.

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.769
That's the trick.

00:36:54.769 --> 00:36:55.394
KAI HALEY: Yes.

00:36:55.394 --> 00:36:56.876
Come here.

00:36:56.876 --> 00:36:58.358
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:36:58.358 --> 00:36:59.850
Thanks.

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:05.658
So one of the things Google
Design Sprint Methodology

00:37:05.658 --> 00:37:09.562
forces us to do is you
have to go into the sprint

00:37:09.562 --> 00:37:12.978
with a very clear problem
you want to solve.

00:37:12.978 --> 00:37:16.430
It sounds like from
what you're saying

00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:18.830
the ExecCamp is a little
different in the sense

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:21.710
that you walk in with
[INAUDIBLE] blank slate.

00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:24.925
You come up with either
completely brand new solutions,

00:37:24.925 --> 00:37:26.515
transformative
solutions, [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:26.515 --> 00:37:27.390
what you already had.

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:29.362
Your [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:29.362 --> 00:37:35.278
How do you guide or
constrain the process?

00:37:35.278 --> 00:37:36.757
And do you even try to do that?

00:37:36.757 --> 00:37:39.897
Or is it just like come up
with whatever you come up

00:37:39.897 --> 00:37:43.406
with, whether it's crazy, blue
sky, 10 years down the line,

00:37:43.406 --> 00:37:46.310
or short term, it
doesn't matter?

00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:47.960
BARRY O'REILLY: Brilliant.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:52.000
Just to repeat the question,
typically in a Design Sprint

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.880
within Google, we have
a specific challenge

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.670
or question that we're
trying to answer.

00:37:57.670 --> 00:38:01.540
In ExecCamp, it sounds like
you've more of a blank canvas.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:04.600
How do we manage the idea that
people just, doesn't everyone

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.620
tries to create
Uber for the next x,

00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:08.170
or whatever it might be?

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:11.700
How do we constrain it a bit?

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:18.180
I think the answer is
for any design to happen,

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.980
you need constraints.

00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.870
You have to set some
sort of constraint

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:25.240
around a problem
space or a boundary.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.590
Now, because we're
working typically

00:38:27.590 --> 00:38:32.550
at the executive level, they're
thinking of moonshot equivalent

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:33.260
ideas.

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.760
That's what you're trying
to encourage them to do.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:38.380
But the way I
constrain them is we

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.090
use a technique called
Transformational Targets.

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:44.190
It's a small, little
workshop that I

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:48.380
run where we put basically
a radar on the wall.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:50.610
And we say to
them, what would be

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:53.350
transformative
for your business?

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:57.220
Describe something that would
radically change the way

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.920
your business operates.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.754
Now, just to give an
example, for instance,

00:39:00.754 --> 00:39:02.670
in the cargo business,
and this is great stuff

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:04.086
that I've been
learning since I've

00:39:04.086 --> 00:39:06.360
been working with
these companies,

00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:08.540
there's paper everywhere.

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.610
Paper for paper for
paper for paper.

00:39:11.610 --> 00:39:13.614
It's unbelievable.

00:39:13.614 --> 00:39:15.280
The next time you're
getting on a plane,

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:18.770
you see these cargo bays
going in underneath the plane,

00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:21.490
everything on that has
to have a piece of paper

00:39:21.490 --> 00:39:25.430
to describe what it is, what
it's about, who's it going to.

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:27.950
It's all handwritten.

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:28.592
It's passed.

00:39:28.592 --> 00:39:31.050
When you get on the plane, the
last thing to get on a plane

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:35.000
is a huge satchel of paper which
describes all the things that

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.550
are on the plane.

00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:41.180
They have massive issues
like double-typing,

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.610
or can't read handwriting.

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:47.470
This is why all your bags
disappear most of the time.

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:49.840
In that industry, when we
did the exercise with them,

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.830
we were like, what
would be transformative

00:39:51.830 --> 00:39:53.100
for your business?

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:55.720
And they were like, no paper.

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:58.000
0% paper.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.401
So we were like, brilliant.

00:39:59.401 --> 00:39:59.900
OK.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:03.320
That sort of gives
us a constraint.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.080
And they came up with other
things like financial measures,

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.900
or people development,
and so quite a big radar,

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:10.820
prioritized them,
and then coming up

00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:12.240
with a shortlist of maybe four.

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.320
I'd like to say
between three and five

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.770
that are
transformational targets.

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:17.560
They have to be smart goals.

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.610
So they have to
say like 0% paper.

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:25.960
Or plus 20% NPS
score in two years.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.600
They have to be
measurable and scientific.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.020
And then, what we
do is when we start

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:35.470
to generate all these ideas, the
way we challenge them and say,

00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:39.670
will Uber for airlines
get rid of paper?

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:44.520
And it's that sort of question
to challenge and constrain

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:45.930
it a little bit.

00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:49.275
And then, it gives us
something to test against.

00:40:49.275 --> 00:40:51.400
Again, we're creating this
governance framework all

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.690
the time of well, in order for
an idea to be worth challenging

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:57.960
and moving forward,
it has to fit

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.110
within these transformational
targets we've set ourselves.

00:41:01.110 --> 00:41:03.810
And that again, gives us
another feedback mechanism

00:41:03.810 --> 00:41:06.460
to say, well, how can we make
this idea more transformative?

00:41:06.460 --> 00:41:07.800
And so on.

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.370
That's the technique we use.

00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:14.560
But yes, definitely, when you're
in the Design Sprint world,

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.860
there's probably more of an
optimization of an existing

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:19.620
problem.

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.500
But we get to that stage too.

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:22.870
You get there through iteration.

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:26.330
So over time, the
challenge becomes clearer.

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:29.060
But at the inception
of the workshops,

00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:30.930
they're still quite
very broad ideas.

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:34.060
There's lots of fuzziness
around the outside.

00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:37.340
But we reduce that through
the testing cycles.

00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.470
And the way we test
is generally they

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:41.990
have to do two customer
interviews a week.

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:44.270
So the execs have to sit
down with their ideas

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:47.190
and showcase them to customers
feedback twice a week.

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:50.100
We generally invite
in someone from a VC

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:52.180
or a business
thought leader where

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:56.620
they have to pitch to
someone external in the room.

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.830
So they keep challenging
their own thinking about how

00:41:58.830 --> 00:42:00.530
the business stands up.

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:03.210
And then, at the end
of every two weeks,

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:06.660
they've got to pitch back to the
CEO of the entire organization

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:09.270
and say, this is
what we've learned.

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:11.270
This is what we're
going to do next.

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:13.550
Do you want to keep
investing in this?

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:17.900
So we even apply experimentation
to the process itself.

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:20.780
Because if they invest in two
or three weeks' worth of work,

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.830
and they're like, this
isn't working for us.

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:23.330
Cool.

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:25.200
Let's kill it.

00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:27.090
We've just been lucky
enough, I don't know,

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:29.310
maybe, I'd like to think
that we're actually

00:42:29.310 --> 00:42:30.760
working in a good way.

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:33.280
But everyone who's got to
that stage has kept investing,

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.404
wants to keep going.

00:42:34.404 --> 00:42:35.820
But again, it's a
different person

00:42:35.820 --> 00:42:37.470
to challenge your thinking.

00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:39.430
You've always got to
keep bringing people in

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:42.040
to challenge the
bias in the room.

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.970
Eventually, we'll all think
something's a great idea.

00:42:44.970 --> 00:42:48.500
So we show it to a customer to
get a different perspective.

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:51.210
Eventually we'll, again, think
everything's a great idea.

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:52.870
We'll show it to
someone who's a VC,

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:55.814
give us a different
type of feedback.

00:42:55.814 --> 00:42:57.480
That's what we try
to propagate and live

00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:00.320
a lot of the principles
that we advocate while we're

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.570
running these things.

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:03.410
And that's what makes
it so invigorating

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:06.620
because no two
have been the same.

00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:09.140
We've got a high level
deliberate method,

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.510
but the adaptability comes on
what we learn with each client

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:13.620
when we do it.

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:16.840
And we just pivot
the whole process

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.580
to match what we're learning
as a team, which again, is very

00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:22.030
exciting, but very challenging.

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:23.530
Because every day
you got to come up

00:43:23.530 --> 00:43:25.477
with a new set of
activities to run.

00:43:25.477 --> 00:43:28.060
A most execs, when you go, we're
going to do this for the day,

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:29.185
they're like, no we're not.

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:35.750
KAI HALEY: Well, that sounds
very, very challenging.

00:43:35.750 --> 00:43:37.840
Fascinating.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.000
We have a few more minutes.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.410
Are there any other questions?

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:42.910
Yes.

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:43.702
Go ahead.

00:43:43.702 --> 00:43:45.910
I wanted to open it up to
questions across the board.

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:46.220
BARRY O'REILLY: Yeah.

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:47.198
Of course, yeah.

00:43:52.090 --> 00:43:55.800
AUDIENCE: I found that people
tend to struggle with the word

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.550
"design."

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:02.710
They'll hear Design
Sprint and Design Thinking

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:05.210
and they're like, well,
OK, that's a designer.

00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:06.793
They just draw a few
pictures all day.

00:44:06.793 --> 00:44:09.000
What do they know about
businesses or launching

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.200
products?

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:14.668
I'm wondering if you use the
word "design" thinking Design

00:44:14.668 --> 00:44:16.270
Sprint [INAUDIBLE] what you do.

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:18.340
And if not, what do
you say [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:19.740
BARRY O'REILLY: Yeah, thank you.

00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.890
It's funny.

00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:25.800
The way I think of the
world now is that we're

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.580
all designers, actually.

00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:32.100
The CEO is designing a company,
is designing a business.

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:36.560
And I talk to them very
much from that premise.

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.480
But to the second
part of your question,

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:42.270
I do try to stay away,
as much as possible,

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:45.670
from telling people that we're
going to do Design Thinking.

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:47.160
We're going to do Lean Startup.

00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.875
We're going to do
Lean Enterprise.

00:44:48.875 --> 00:44:51.250
I don't even tell people when
I work with them that we're

00:44:51.250 --> 00:44:53.770
going to do Lean Enterprise.

00:44:53.770 --> 00:44:56.750
What I talk to them
much more about

00:44:56.750 --> 00:45:00.090
is what they're going to
learn as a result of trying

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:03.510
these new things, that they're
going to use techniques that

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:06.480
feel very uncomfortable to
start because they've never

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:08.370
done them before.

00:45:08.370 --> 00:45:11.970
But again, I try to be very
clear about the expectations

00:45:11.970 --> 00:45:15.125
of the goal of these methods
is to help you learn fast

00:45:15.125 --> 00:45:16.750
what works, what
doesn't, and should we

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:19.920
do something different to
generate better information,

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.270
to make better decisions.

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:26.170
And when I talk to people
like that, especially

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:28.170
the leadership, they listen.

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:30.520
Because they want to
make better decisions.

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:34.360
They want to have better
data to make those decisions.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.102
They want to learn
things about how

00:45:36.102 --> 00:45:37.810
their business or
their company operates.

00:45:37.810 --> 00:45:39.930
They're very keen to do that.

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:42.210
Because you have
to remember when

00:45:42.210 --> 00:45:46.570
you are a leader in an
organization the information

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:49.900
you get is so sanitized.

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:52.100
I call it "watermelon
reporting."

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:55.140
It's like, the delivery
team down on the bottom,

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:57.470
they're working away and
something's not working.

00:45:57.470 --> 00:46:00.480
So they put their
project report as red.

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.200
And they pass it up
to the next person.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:05.110
And the person is like, well,
I don't want that to be red.

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:06.500
Someone might shout out at me.

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:09.870
So I'll just turn it to
amber and pass that on.

00:46:09.870 --> 00:46:11.910
And then, the next
person is well,

00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:13.160
I don't want to be shouted at.

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.243
I'll just turn that amber.

00:46:14.243 --> 00:46:15.210
It's going to be OK.

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:16.251
They're going to make it.

00:46:16.251 --> 00:46:17.770
I'll turn it to green.

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:21.030
And then, the people who
are leading the organization

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:23.140
have these reports
that are filled

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:26.890
with inconsistent
or incorrect data.

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:29.670
And then, that's the information
they use to make decisions

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:31.810
about how to run the business.

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:35.080
So when stuff
doesn't work or they

00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.730
get the consequences
they don't expect,

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:40.650
they're making
decisions from bad data.

00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:43.582
There's an ownership on us
to help them understand that.

00:46:43.582 --> 00:46:45.540
And that's why I get them
to talk to customers.

00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:48.080
Because it's raw data.

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:49.240
It's customer feedback.

00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.310
It's as raw as it gets.

00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:52.070
And they love it.

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:54.160
Because they're like,
I'm learning stuff.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:57.210
Hey, that process I designed
for hiring, it sucks.

00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:58.020
Yes.

00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:00.040
We should change that.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:01.540
Because they never
get that insight.

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:03.123
They're just told,
yeah, it's working.

00:47:03.123 --> 00:47:05.617
There's a few problems,
but we're ironing it out.

00:47:05.617 --> 00:47:07.450
They want to hear that
it sucks because they

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:10.170
want to make it better.

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:13.310
All those ideas about bringing
data to a conversation,

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:16.850
helping them learn new things,
helping them learn new skills,

00:47:16.850 --> 00:47:19.720
I really more start
from there, and then

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:22.070
talk about the
benefits of what they

00:47:22.070 --> 00:47:24.470
can do with that data
and those techniques.

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:26.990
And they can apply it to
all parts of their life.

00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:29.350
And I used the word
experimentation quite a lot.

00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:38.910
AUDIENCE: It seems like these
executives are going off

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:42.450
into this world for
nearly two months

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:46.290
and they're getting
a new way of working,

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:50.382
a new way of thinking that
is closer to their raw data.

00:47:50.382 --> 00:47:51.382
But then they come back.

00:47:51.382 --> 00:47:53.590
And you said you developed
these governance processes

00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:58.862
to help bring this kind of
thinking back to their company.

00:47:58.862 --> 00:48:03.061
But how does what
you do integrate more

00:48:03.061 --> 00:48:05.778
with the culture
inside an organization

00:48:05.778 --> 00:48:11.762
when those folks on the
ground might not be accepting?

00:48:11.762 --> 00:48:15.318
The exec had to go through six
to eight weeks of ExecCamp,

00:48:15.318 --> 00:48:18.126
what about the
folks on the ground?

00:48:18.126 --> 00:48:22.310
BARRY O'REILLY: Yeah, it's,
again, a fair question, right?

00:48:22.310 --> 00:48:25.550
There's always inertia
when you take people out

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:27.750
of their day-to-day work
and you bring them off

00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:30.290
somewhere else to do
something and bring them back.

00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:34.087
And they're like, hey, we
went to the Joshua Tree.

00:48:34.087 --> 00:48:34.920
And we've come back.

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.753
And now we see the world
in a different way.

00:48:36.753 --> 00:48:38.590
Right?

00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:40.080
This type of thing.

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:45.080
But I think it's
very powerful when

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:48.120
you have the leadership
of a company,

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.060
you have an experience
that is very

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:52.740
much like the day-to-day
operation for most

00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:54.540
people in the company.

00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:58.030
They get exposed to new ways
of thinking and working.

00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:00.220
They get inspired by it.

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:03.150
One of the best
pieces that we've

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:06.570
had as a result of this
work is the CEO of one

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:08.805
of the largest banks in America.

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:14.090
We're working with
him and their team

00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:19.150
to implement this type of stuff.

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:21.000
And we ran a retrospective.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.680
And the biggest feedback
from the entire group

00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:27.770
was, we thought
this stuff is easy.

00:49:27.770 --> 00:49:29.370
It looks easy.

00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:32.210
You plan, you do something,
you check, you act.

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:33.730
You build, you
measure, you learn.

00:49:33.730 --> 00:49:35.645
You do an OODA loop, whatever.

00:49:35.645 --> 00:49:37.757
It looks easy on paper.

00:49:37.757 --> 00:49:40.340
But then, we actually have to
go through one of these learning

00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:43.300
loops and realized
how difficult it was.

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:47.840
And then, he socialized that
with the entire organization.

00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:50.040
He has an executive blog.

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:54.700
And he's like, I thought
this Agile stuff was easy.

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:57.240
It's actually really hard.

00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:01.040
For the whole company,
that lifted everybody.

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.080
They're like, wow.

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.580
They actually
understand how tough it

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:06.380
is to do what I'm trying to do.

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:08.390
It's not simple.

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:11.270
And that, in itself,
builds empathy, which is,

00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:16.740
again, a great tool as leaders
to understand the context

00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:17.950
people are operating in.

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:20.260
That's what customer
development is about.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.430
That's what Get Out Of
The Building is about.

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:25.410
That's what [INAUDIBLE]
Genba, or Go and See,

00:50:25.410 --> 00:50:29.220
from when Toyota started off
all this stuff, is about.

00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:31.290
And I think that's
probably the way

00:50:31.290 --> 00:50:35.310
I try to challenge that
inertia and make the leadership

00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:36.770
team aware of that,
that they need

00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:41.355
to share their story because
that's what inspires people.

00:50:41.355 --> 00:50:42.230
KAI HALEY: All right.

00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.729
Thank you.

00:50:42.729 --> 00:50:44.360
I think we're out of time.

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.310
We've reached the
end of our session.

00:50:46.310 --> 00:50:47.352
Thank you so much, Barry.

00:50:47.352 --> 00:50:48.226
BARRY O'REILLY: Yeah.

00:50:48.226 --> 00:50:49.560
Thanks for all the questions.

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:53.532
It's really enjoyable to answer
them and challenge my thinking.

00:50:53.532 --> 00:50:55.990
And it's a pleasure to be here
and share the story with you

00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.250
all.

00:50:56.250 --> 00:50:57.710
Thank you very much,
Kai, for inviting me

00:50:57.710 --> 00:50:59.160
and everyone who's come along.

00:50:59.160 --> 00:50:59.900
Thank you.

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:00.726
KAI HALEY: It was
wonderful to have you.

00:51:00.726 --> 00:51:01.560
All right.

00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:03.210
Thanks.
