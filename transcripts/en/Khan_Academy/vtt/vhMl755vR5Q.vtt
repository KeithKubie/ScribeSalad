00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.220
Let's do some more volumes
of solids of revolutions.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.460
So let's say that
I have the graph

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.210
y is equal to square root of x.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.520
So let's do it, so it
looks something like this.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:20.060
So that right over there is y is
equal to the square root of x.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.410
And let's say I also have
the graph of y equals x.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.220
So let's say y equals x
looks something like this.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.030
It looks just like that.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.640
y equals x.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.700
And what I care about
now is the solid

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.570
I get if I were to rotate the
area between these two things

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.932
around to the x-axis.

00:00:44.932 --> 00:00:46.140
So let's try to visualize it.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.244
So the outside is going to
be kind of a truffle shape,

00:00:50.244 --> 00:00:51.910
it's going to look
like a truffle shape.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.220
And then we hollow out
a cone inside of it.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.160
So I'll make my best
attempt to draw this shape.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:05.170
So it's going to look something
like-- so the outside is

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.180
going to look
something like this.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.230
It's going to look
something like that.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.800
And we care about the interval.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.080
We care about the interval
between the points

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.030
that they intersect.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.250
So between this point
and this point here.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.125
So the outside is going to
look something like this.

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:24.749
So this is the base
of the truffle.

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:26.290
That is the base of
the truffle, it's

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.330
going to have this kind of
truffle shape on the outside.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.350
But I guess maybe we're
on some type of a diet,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.510
we don't want to eat
to the entire truffle.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.500
So we carve out a
cone on the inside.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.800
So the inside of
it is essentially

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.800
hollow except for this
kind of shell part.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:48.090
So we carve out a
cone in the center.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.650
So we rotate it
around to the x-axis.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.422
Truffle on the outside, carved
out a cone on the inside.

00:01:54.422 --> 00:01:56.380
So what's going to be
the volume of that thing?

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.350
So it's essentially, if we
take a slice of our figure,

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.312
it's going to be, this
is going to be the wall.

00:02:04.312 --> 00:02:05.770
And we're essentially
going to take

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.440
the volume of this
entire wall that we're

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.520
rotating around the x-axis.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.580
So how do we do that?

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.360
Well, it might dawn
on you that if we

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.210
found the volume of the
truffle if it was not

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.560
carved out, and then
subtract from that the volume

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.600
of the cone, we
would essentially

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.350
find out the volume of the
space in between the outside

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.560
of the truffle and the
cone part of the truffle.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.370
So how would we do that?

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.860
Well, so to find the
volume of the outer shape.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.441
So let me draw it over here.

00:02:38.441 --> 00:02:40.190
So actually let me
just draw it over here.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.189
If we think about the
volume of the outer shape,

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.180
once again, we can
use the disk method.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.840
So at any given point in time
our radius for one of our disks

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.950
is going to be equal
to the function.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.659
Let's rotate that disk around.

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.450
Actually let me do it
in a different color,

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.045
it's hard to see that
disk because it's

00:02:57.045 --> 00:02:57.878
in the same magenta.

00:02:57.878 --> 00:03:01.890
So this is a radius, and
let's rotate it around.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.860
So I'm rotating the disk around.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.280
This is our face of the disk,
that's our face of the disk.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.820
It's going to have
a depth of dx.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.520
We've seen this multiple times.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.990
It's going to have
a depth of dx.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.980
So the volume of
this disk is going

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.090
to be our depth, dx, times
the area of the face.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.730
The area of the face is going to
be pi times the radius squared.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.430
The radius is going to
be equal to the value

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.820
of the outer function, in this
case the square root of x.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.760
So it's going to be pi
times our radius squared,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.150
which is pi times the
square root of x squared.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.950
And so if we want
to find the volume

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.469
of the entire outer
thimble, or truffle,

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:46.760
or whatever we want to call it.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.130
Before we even carve
out the center,

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.409
we just take a sum of a bunch
of these, a bunch of these disks

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:55.200
that we've created.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.592
So that's one disk, we would
have another disk over here.

00:03:58.592 --> 00:03:59.550
Another disk over here.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.510
For each x we have another disk.

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.320
And as we go, as x's
get larger and larger,

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.030
the disks have a larger
and larger radius.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.700
So we're going to sum
up all of those disks.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.040
And we're going to take the
limit as each of those disks

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.037
get infinitely thin, and we
have an infinite number of them.

00:04:15.037 --> 00:04:17.370
But we have to figure out our
boundaries of integration.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.119
So what are our
boundaries of integration?

00:04:19.119 --> 00:04:22.865
What are the two points right
over here where they intersect?

00:04:22.865 --> 00:04:24.490
Well we could just
set these two things

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.940
to be equal to each other.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.140
If you just said x is
equal to square root of x,

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.482
when does x equal
the square root of x?

00:04:32.482 --> 00:04:34.190
I mean you can square
both sides of this.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.980
You could say when
does x squared equal x?

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.590
You could, well we
could keep it there.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:42.260
You could kind of
solve this, there's

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.510
multiple ways you could do it.

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.950
But you could solve this kind
of just thinking about it.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.030
If x is equal to 0, x
squared is equal to x.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.030
And you see that on the
graph right over here. x

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.210
is equal to 0.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.370
And also 1 squared
is equal to 1.

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.666
1 is equal to the
square root of 1.

00:04:55.666 --> 00:04:57.040
You could have
done other things.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.580
You could say OK, x squared
minus x is equal to 0.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.670
You could factor out an x.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.330
You get x times x
minus 1 is equal to 0.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.000
And so either one of
these could be equal to 0,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.110
so x is equal to 0 or x
minus 1 is equal to 0.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.290
And then you get x equals
0 or x is equal to 1.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.920
Which gives us our
boundaries of integration.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.340
So this goes from x
equals 0 to x equals 1.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.740
And so for the
outside of our shape

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.250
we can now figure
out the volume.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.120
But we're not done.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.661
We also need to
figure out the volume

00:05:32.661 --> 00:05:35.040
of the inside of our shape
that we're going to take out.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.212
So we're going to
subtract out that volume.

00:05:37.212 --> 00:05:38.920
So we're going to
subtract out of volume.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.400
Our x values, once again,
are going between 0 and 1.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.930
And so let's think
about those disks.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.820
So let's think about,
let's construct a disk

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.500
on the inside, right over here.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.580
So if I construct a
disk on the inside.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.660
So now I'm carving out
the cone part of it.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.660
What is the area of the
face of one of those disks?

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:06.070
Well it's going to be pi
times the radius squared.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.050
In this case, the
radius is going

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:10.300
to be equal to the value of
this inner function, which

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:13.070
is just x.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.150
And so this is just
y is equal to x.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.130
And then we're going to
multiply it times the depth,

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.730
times the depth of
each of these disks.

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.345
And each of these disks are
going to have a depth of dx.

00:06:24.345 --> 00:06:29.610
If you imagine a quarter that
has an infinitely-thin depth

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:30.450
right over here.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.360
So it's going to be dx.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.200
And so the volume our, kind of
our truffle with a cone carved

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.730
out, is going to
be this integral

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.740
minus this integral
right over here.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.860
And we could evaluate
it just like that.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.980
Or we could even say,
OK we could factor out

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.542
a pi out of both of them.

00:06:46.542 --> 00:06:48.250
There are actually,
there's multiple ways

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:48.630
that we could write it.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.171
But let's just
evaluate it like this,

00:06:50.171 --> 00:06:52.380
and then I'll generalize
it in the next video.

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:55.770
So this is going to be equal
to the definite integral from 0

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.610
to 1.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.340
You take the pi outside.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.980
Square root of x
squared is going

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:06.650
to be x dx minus the integral,
we can factor the pi out.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:12.410
From 0 to 1 of x squared dx.

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:15.190
And we could say
this is going to be

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:21.620
equal to pi times the
antiderivative of x, which

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:26.290
is just x squared over
2 evaluated from 0 to 1,

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:30.390
minus pi, times the
antiderivative of x squared,

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:35.900
which is x to the third over
3 evaluated from 0 to 1.

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:37.500
This expression is
equal to-- and I'm

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.050
going to arbitrarily
switch colors

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:43.410
just because the green's getting
monotonous-- pi times 1 squared

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:47.050
over 2 minus 0 squared over 2.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.400
I could write squared.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:55.530
1 squared over 2 minus 0
squared over 2, minus pi times 1

00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:01.000
to the third over 3 minus
0 to the third over 3.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.970
And so we get, this
is equal to-- let

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.890
me do it in that
same blue color--

00:08:08.890 --> 00:08:10.330
so this is this simplified.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.800
This is just 0 right over here.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.050
This is 1 squared over
2, which is just 1/2.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:21.360
So it's just pi over 2, 1/2
times pi minus-- well this

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:26.560
is just 0, this is
1/3, minus pi over 3.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.080
And then to simplify
this, it's just

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:30.290
really subtracting fractions.

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:32.700
So we can find a
common denominator.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.970
Common denominator is 6.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.570
This is going to be 3 pi over 6.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:42.544
This is 3 pi over 6
minus 2 pi over 6.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:50.120
pi over 3 is 2 pi over 6,
pi over 2 is 3 pi over 6.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.020
And we end up with, we
end up with 3 of something

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.240
minus 2 of something, you
end up with 1 of something.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.120
We end up with 1 pi over 6.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.390
And we are done.

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.610
We were able to find the
volume of that wacky kind

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.189
of gutted-out truffle.
