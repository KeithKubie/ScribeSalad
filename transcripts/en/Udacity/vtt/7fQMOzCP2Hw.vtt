00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.252
As I just said, today we're going to talk about the

00:00:02.252 --> 00:00:04.876
Rational Unified Process. And you know that I like to provide

00:00:04.876 --> 00:00:07.632
the historical perspective of the topics that we cover in class

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:10.070
and this lesson is no exception. So let's see a little bit

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.500
of history of RUP. To do that we have to go

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.620
back to 1997 when Rational defined six best practices for modern software

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.930
engineering. So let's look at what these practices were. The first

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.330
practice involved developing in an iterative way with risk as the primary

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.700
iteration driver. The second practice had to do

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.375
with managing requirements, including updating them and keeping

00:00:31.375 --> 00:00:34.570
traceability information between requirements and other software

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.675
artifacts. Practice number three was to employ a

00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:40.830
component-based architecture. What that means is to have

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.540
a high level design that focuses on cooperating

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.780
components that are nevertheless very cohesive and highly

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.710
decoupled. Modeling software visually is another key aspect

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.250
of the rational unified process. And the key concept

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.070
here is to use visual diagrams, and in particular UML

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.520
visual diagrams, in a very extensive way so as

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.950
to make artifacts easier to understand and agree upon among

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.849
stakeholders. And the fact that the process is defined

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:08.510
in an iterative way, allows for performing quality assurance activities

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.430
in a continuous way. So it allows for continuously

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.860
verifying quality throughout the development

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.220
process. Finally, change management and

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.750
control were also at the center of the rational

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.100
approach These six practices, that I just mentioned were

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.740
the starting point for the development of the Rational

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.300
Unified Process, which is what we're going to discuss next.
