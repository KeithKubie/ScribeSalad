00:00:04.399 --> 00:00:05.879
So now let's talk about virtual reality.

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.080
We have this idea that one of the things that
our media does, one of the things the way

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:19.220
that we perceive the world does, is change
the nature of how our psychology works.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.089
Our psychology is designed to be adaptive
to our environment, and so if I change the

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:28.939
way that we're interacting with the environment
I change the psychology, and that has durable

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.279
effects.

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.879
VR is kind of a big deal.

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:46.710
It represents a radical increase in our capacity
to modify the way that we perceive reality.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:56.130
It's highly immersive, it's multi-modal, so
in principle it can be visual, auditory, kinesthetic—I

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.489
mean we could layer other things potentially
in, with electrical stimulation and olfactory

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:07.400
if we want to—but the idea is that our conscious
sense of self-identity, our position in the

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.820
world, is actually a relatively loosely held
construct.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.830
There's been very good experiments on the
way that you can actually cause someone’s

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.000
sense of even where their body is in space
to just go away and make them feel like they're

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.580
15 feet in front of where they actually are,
because we're always doing our best job to

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.940
integrate the total input of our sensory modalities
to make a coherent gestalt of, 'Oh this is

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.380
world, and this is self.'

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:41.090
And what VR does is it provides enough fidelity
of information and enough coherence of modality

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:47.750
to jack or hack that underlying mechanism
whereby we actually create our construct of

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.440
self and world.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.720
That's a serious fucking thing.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.640
If you think about the way a little kid interfaces
with a film, a movie; for a little while they're

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.490
sort of confused about what's real and what's
not real when they're observing it, but there's

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:09.060
enough difference between sitting in a chair
and watching a video and being in the world

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.060
that eventually you learn to recognize and
separate the two.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.430
In VR, and as we get better and better at
doing it, that distinction goes away.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.069
And this is quite important.

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.609
The line between what it means to be dreaming
and what it means to be awake is going to

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:31.529
become very interesting, and it's going to
become more and more interesting, because

00:02:31.529 --> 00:02:36.430
remember VR is just one piece of a generalized
consequence of accelerating technology.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.549
So it's not just that we're going to be doing
VR, we're also going to be radically improving

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.359
our actuation capacity in the world in general.

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:51.659
And so we can imagine circumstances where
I might craft an object in VR, and then—say

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:57.849
in quasi-real-time—some mechanism is in
fact actually 3D printing that object so then

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.312
I reach out, take off my VR glasses and the
thing that I thought I was creating in an

00:03:01.312 --> 00:03:06.079
entirely imaginary space is actually physically
present in my hand.

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.749
That's going to cause some very interesting
changes in the way that we relate to the difference

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:13.790
between what reality can do and what imagination
can do.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.230
And as I mentioned to you in our sort of conversation
before this thing started, as a consequence

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.389
of all this VR is particularly effective at
blowing your mind.

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:29.579
And I mean in terms of disrupting your underlying
construct about what the nature of reality

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:30.579
happens to be.

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.109
And this is very good news and also extraordinarily
bad news.

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:40.129
From the extraordinarily bad perspective it
means that VR is extremely well-positioned

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:48.980
to create a designed reality that you're going
to have a very, very hard time rejecting.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.980
If you think about the way that propaganda,
back in the early 20th century, got good at

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.669
understanding how human beings parse information
to make decisions and getting in underneath

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:04.019
our psychological defense mechanisms, VR is
100 million times more capable of engaging

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.589
in that.

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:13.199
The good news is, is if we do a much, much
better job at being—let's call it ethical—at

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:17.669
crafting a relationship between our power
to affect the world and the way that power

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.620
affects us, so if we do a much, much better
job at being ethical around VR, then it will

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:31.270
be the most powerful tool that we have for
radically improving the way that we respond

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.620
to the world, for upgrading our capacity to
respond to the world, because it would be

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.039
a much more embodied and whole system hack
for our deep constructs.

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.039
Does that make sense?
