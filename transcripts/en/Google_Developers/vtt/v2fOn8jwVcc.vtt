CHRIS CARTLAND: Welcome to
Google+ Developers Live.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.180
My name is Chris Cartland, and
I'm a developer programs

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.070
engineer working on the
Google+ platform.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.040
WESLEY TARLE: And
I'm Wes Tarle.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.510
I'm an engineer on Google+.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.870
CHRIS CARTLAND: Today we're
excited to talk to you about

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.340
Google+ Sign-In on Android.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.030
Google+ Sign-In allows
developers to take advantage

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.050
of a lot of cool features,
including interactive posts,

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.040
over the air installs, and
app personalization.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.840
Today we're going to talk about
Sign-In using the Quick

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.430
Start that we put on our
website for you to use.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.130
WESLEY TARLE: The invite Google+
SDK is the fastest way

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.420
to get started with the sign-in

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.170
with Google+ on Android.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.330
It's really easy.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.190
I think the Quick Start is a
great way to get started.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.970
CHRIS CARTLAND: So
let's do it.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.930
We're going to look at
my laptop right here.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.010
I'm at
developers.google.com/plus.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.180
This is the home page for
the Google+ platform.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.290
We're going to just try a Quick
Start right now, which

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.710
is on the left-hand side of the
page, and we're going to

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.120
look at Android because that's
what you're all here to see.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.050
This Quick Start guide for
Android is a step-by-step

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.420
guide that shows you exactly
how to get started.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.460
So we're going to
do that today.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.050
But you can go through, follow
those instructions, and by the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.050
end, you usually have the same
application running on your

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.670
phone or your tablet, whatever
device that you have.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.310
So the first thing that I'm
going to do is go to the API

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.950
console to make sure that I have
everything configured for

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.200
this project.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.220
Those of you that have used
Google API before are very

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.470
familiar with this.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.360
I'm going to create a new
project for this demonstration

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.110
and I'm going to call
Android Quick Start.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.270
If you already have an
application that you're using

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.990
for your website, your
production applications should

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.650
use that same project.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.680
And that's to be the same
project if you're using the

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.090
web and Android.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.780
You want to put them all in
the same place so that the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.320
features work well together.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.730
I'm going to turn on
the Google+ API.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.640
The first time you do this
you'll have to accept the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.100
terms and conditions
of the API.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.450
And you notice that this page
has a lot of different boxes

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.700
on it, and that's because you
can turn on any API that

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.280
Google offers just by flipping
a switch here.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.840
So if your application does more
than just sign-in, this

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.090
is the place you
want to start.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.960
Now I need to set up the API
access by creating a client ID

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.200
for the standard application.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.680
I click Create a Client ID, and
this is now the branding

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.460
information that will be
shown to your user.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.050
So make sure to pick a good
product name that they'll

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.800
understand who their authorizing
with information.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:04.010
And for testing this doesn't
really matter, but for your

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.610
production application you'll
want to put in a nice little

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.750
picture here so people
know what your logo

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.400
is and who you are.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.680
The type of client ID that
we're going to create for

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.220
Android is an installed
application, and it's going to

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.530
be for Android.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.850
You will also set up your web
application here, if you were

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.030
going to do a website.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:28.180
WESLEY TARLE: So this part's
really important, and I think

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.410
a lot of people miss it.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.945
This package name, you have to
enter the package name from

00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:35.070
your Android manifest.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.180
The signing certificates,
fingerprints, that's the hash

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.130
of your signing certificates
that you use to sign your

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.250
APKs, I think that we'll put
in a debug certificate for

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.280
now, but you'll need to use
your production one.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.280
If you don't do this step then
things won't work on Android.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.550
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.770
So, let's do the package
name first.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.100
The sample application already
comes with a package name

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:01.920
built-in to the manifest.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.540
We're going to just copy that
from our instructions and put

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.570
that into the API console.

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:13.350
For the signing certificate
you'll need to use the key

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.610
tool utility.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.220
I can also get that command
from our documentation and

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.500
copy that into terminal.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.420
WESLEY TARLE: So you're
extracting the fingerprint

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.120
from your debug key store
in Eclipse right now.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.060
For production apps you'll
have it somewhere else.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.990
CHRIS CARTLAND: Correct.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.760
So the debug key store, which
Eclipse uses, is a stream that

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.660
you can copy.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.200
And I'm going to run the key
tool and enter the password.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.406
WESLEY TARLE: And that password
is Android for all

00:04:50.406 --> 00:04:52.680
debug key stores.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.440
CHRIS CARTLAND: I'm going to
copy the SHA1 and put that

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.710
into the API console.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:01.740
Great.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.080
This is also where you would
turn on deep linking, if you

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.970
were going to enable
the application.

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.930
We're not going to do that
today, but we'll talk about it

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.180
some other time.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:14.290
Great.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.080
So that was setting
up the API access.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.410
That means we'll be able
to use Google+ in our

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.840
application.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.320
I'm now going go look at
Android in Eclipse.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:29.425
The first thing I need to make
sure I've done is updated all

00:05:29.425 --> 00:05:34.340
of the SDK through the
Android SDK Manager.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.360
The things you need are updated
Android SDK tools.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.200
WESLEY TARLE: Yeah, so those two
at the top are installed

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.430
by default.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.040
You'll need to scroll
down to extras and

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.570
find Google Play services.

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.410
That's the client code for
Google Play services that

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.900
you'll want to include
in your apps.

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:55.410
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.610
So, I've already installed that,
because you only need to

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:00.320
do it once for all your
applications.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.000
And I'm ready to go.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.670
So now I actually want the
code, which is important.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.820
So I'm going to import
the Google+ sample.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.090
So from Import, I choose
Existing Android Code into

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.350
Workspace, and I have
to browse for

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.920
this through Directory.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:27.150
This will be in your Android
SDK's extras folder under

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.320
Google and Google
Play services.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.770
And I can click Open, and this
shows me a couple of projects.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.510
WESLEY TARLE: So here at the
top is the Google Play

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:40.430
services library project.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.520
That includes code and resources
that you'll include

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.410
in your app, or in the sample
app in this case.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.110
And you can see that once
you've got Google Play

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.230
services installed, you have
access to things like Plus and

00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.300
Auth, and you see
Maps there, too.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.550
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.310
So for this example application,
we only need the

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.330
Google Play services library,
and the actual project for

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.290
this application.

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.570
So I've imported those.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.190
And there's one more step that
I need to do to configure

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.810
this, so I'm going to open up
the Properties on the Plus

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.370
sample activity.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.560
Wes, you wanted to point out
here that there's an Android

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.350
section with the Google
Play services library.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.630
WESLEY TARLE: Yes.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.810
So here we've, in the sample
app, we already include the

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.590
Google Play services
library project.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.330
That's just to get you
started quickly.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.750
When you're adding Google Play
services to your project,

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.060
you'll need to--

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:37.810
I think here we can actually
click on it and

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.230
show them to remove.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.550
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.090
WESLEY TARLE: And then this is
what your project will look

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.170
like when you start, and if you
click add, then you can

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:46.970
add it back, the Google
Play services.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:49.990
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.540
So that's why we had to import
that in the last step so that

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:56.930
it's available here
in the project.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:58.660
WESLEY TARLE: It's slightly
different than just a JAR

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.370
file, because we include strings
and the Sign-In button

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:02.920
and resources like that.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.610
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:08.480
So we also need to configure our
build path, and to do that

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:11.250
we go to Java Build Path,
and we're going to

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:15.020
add external JARs.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:21.500
This JAR is available, like our
documentation says, under

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:25.590
Android SDKs extras,
Android support V4.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:28.360
WESLEY TARLE: So this is an
optional JAR for your

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.890
application that back-ports
fragments and loaders to

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.289
Android 3.0 Plus.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:35.710
We use it in our sample.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:37.190
Most apps use it.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.530
You can decide not to use it and
still get everything you

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.169
want from Google
Play services.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:43.520
CHRIS CARTLAND: So we're going
to use it, and in order to

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.120
make sure it gets into our
project we're going

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:46.990
to export the JAR.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.290
WESLEY TARLE: If you skip that
step, you'll see lots of

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:51.910
errors in your log text.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:52.890
CHRIS CARTLAND: So we want to
make sure we've done that.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.190
Under Order and Export,
check the box.

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.170
And I'll click OK.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:03.970
And now the application is ready
to go in Eclipse, and I

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.380
can run it.

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:11.830
What this will do is build the
project and actually push the

00:09:11.830 --> 00:09:15.550
SDK onto the device
and start it up.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.870
So we're actually going to
switch now to a Nexus 10 that

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:25.400
I have here that is running
the Google+ SDK sample.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.280
So, on the home screen
I have the icon

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.710
for the Google+ sample.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:31.960
I'm going to open it.

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:37.790
And we see a list here of
different things you can do.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.940
The application that we put in
for the Quick Start is divided

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.550
up into all of the different
features that you may want to

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.580
use with Google+ Sign-In, and
they're separated, so you can

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.350
pick which ones are most
interesting to you and try

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:51.180
them out independently.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:51.810
WESLEY TARLE: Yeah,
each one of these

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:52.850
is a different activity.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.480
CHRIS CARTLAND: OK, great.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.480
So we're going to
look Sign-In--

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.250
that's the top activity here.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:03.550
There are three buttons that you
can see, and the first one

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:05.460
is Sign-In, and that's
where a user

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.990
initiates the sign-in flow.

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:15.000
I quick sign-in, and I'm
prompted with the consent flow

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.290
that tells the user what's going
to happen when I agree

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.140
to sign-in using Google.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.050
WESLEY TARLE: So, if you had
skipped the dev console step,

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.210
then you wouldn't see this
screen, you would just see an

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.800
error message.

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.390
So that's a pretty good sign
that you need to go sign up at

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:31.940
dev console.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:32.190
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.680
So since we've done this, we
know that we configured the

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.590
console project correctly and
we're able to sign-in.

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:42.490
Looking at consent screen, I'm
giving information about me

00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:43.730
like my basic--

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:48.230
my name, my profile photo, and
also the people who are in my

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:52.130
circle are being given
to the application.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.690
The second thing is that people
who know that I'm using

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:58.740
the app will be my circle,
based on my choice.

00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.650
I'm going to agree to
this, click OK.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.820
And this will complete the
sign-in with Google.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:06.540
I know that I was able to
successfully sign-in because

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:10.760
the app says Welcome, and then
my name, which for this test

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.720
account is Joe Tester.

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.840
And that means that I am now
completely signed in to the

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:20.170
application, and the Android
application can now make

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.210
requests to Google to find out
information about me, and it

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:25.300
can do any of the other
Google+ Sign-In

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:25.930
features that we want.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.880
WESLEY TARLE: So we've got APIs
for interactive posts and

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:32.240
writing moments, and they're
all available in the other

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.910
activities that you showed.

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:34.760
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.860
So the other buttons on this
screen show me how to sign-out

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:42.250
on Android, which means that if
I click the Sign-In button,

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:44.280
I have to come back in.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.890
If I had multiple accounts on
this device it would ask me

00:11:46.890 --> 00:11:48.970
which one I wanted.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:51.530
The other thing that all
applications need to do when

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:55.570
using Google+ Sign-In is allow
a user to revoke access if

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.590
they no longer want to
use Google+ with

00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:59.240
your application anymore.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.960
And so, you have a button that
does that, so you can see

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.940
exactly how to integrate that
into your application.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.640
WESLEY TARLE: And there's
a simple one-line API

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.490
behind that, too.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:08.550
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah,
it's all very easy.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:09.630
WESLEY TARLE: So you can
show your own UI

00:12:09.630 --> 00:12:12.090
there, if you want.

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:13.290
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:18.270
So, that's the Quick
Start for Android.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:23.490
If you have any questions for
us, please ask those on the

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:24.860
Google+ Event.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.050
You can do that right now
if you're watching live.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:29.020
You can also ask on YouTube.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:32.380
And we'll be looking at those to
see if we can help clarify

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:37.540
anything or just help you with
Google+ Sign-In in general.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.160
I think there are also some
questions that we

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.600
get a lot over time.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.270
So, can you help us go through
some of those, and maybe we

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.120
can help people before
they even know

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.400
that they had a question.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.540
WESLEY TARLE: Sure.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:52.510
So, one question is what
happens if Google Play

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:56.780
services is not on the phone?

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.820
The Google Play services has a
client JAR that you include in

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.700
your application, and an APK
that Google sends out to

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.565
devices from Froyo all the way
up to the latest devices.

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:14.300
Google updates that
automatically on most devices,

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.670
so you should be able to mostly
assume that it's going

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.930
to be installed.

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:25.530
But if you need to, it's a good
idea to use some of the

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:29.450
APIs we have to check whether
it's installed or not, and

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:32.730
then you can actually can
force an install, too.

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:37.330
And we can give you the APIs
launch dialogues and things to

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:38.680
do the install.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:38.910
CHRIS CARTLAND: Awesome.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.160
Great.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.100
WESLEY TARLE: Another question,
what if the user

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.980
doesn't have a Google+
account?

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:54.260
So in this case, if a user has a
Gmail account, then the plus

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.360
client connect that you'll
call-- you'll see it in the

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.360
sign-in in activity.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.260
When you call that, it will
check to see if the user has a

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:06.020
Google+ account, and then show
the [INAUDIBLE] box UI,

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:10.450
including entering their name
and gender, so they can sign

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.880
up for Google+.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.360
And that's sort of--

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.080
you don't have to worry
about any of that.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.330
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:22.980
WESLEY TARLE: What happens
after they upgrade?

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:29.370
So after that flow, the user's
kick back into your app, and

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:35.130
if you check in your on activity
results after that,

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:38.180
you can tell if the user
canceled or accepted the

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:41.620
upgrade to Google+, or if they
canceled or accepted signing

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.510
into your app with
that screen.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.570
So you can use that to decide
whether the user's actually

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:46.790
signed in or not.

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:47.220
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.567
So, yeah, when the user clicks
the Sign-In button and has to

00:14:49.567 --> 00:14:51.600
go through that upgrade flow,
they'll be brought right back

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.850
to your application as
a signed in user.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:54.190
WESLEY TARLE: That's right.

00:14:54.190 --> 00:14:56.620
Either as a signed in user,
or you'll know if

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:57.946
they escaped it somehow.

00:14:57.946 --> 00:14:59.230
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.874
Great.

00:15:00.874 --> 00:15:04.360
WESLEY TARLE: And oh, this
one might be for you.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.700
What does Google+ Sign-In
do to my quota limit?

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.970
CHRIS CARTLAND: Oh yeah, so
some developers, for good

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:13.710
reason, would like to know how
the Google+ API works in

00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:15.470
regards to quota.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:19.130
If the quota that we grant to
you by default is not enough,

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:24.390
you can request more on the
Google+ API's console by going

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:28.340
to the quota section and
then requesting more.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.890
By default we think that there
is a lot for users to do

00:15:31.890 --> 00:15:33.810
Sign-In and other basic
applications.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.850
And you'll keep in mind that
there are two different types,

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.250
there's two buckets for APIs.

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.770
So certain API calls fall into
a really big bucket for doing

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.970
basic things, like knowing
who the user is.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:49.280
And then there's another bucket
that's smaller because

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.160
the calls are more expensive,
and we want to make sure that

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.650
we're providing the best
service for each of us.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:16:00.210
So, yeah, you can go request
more if you need more.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.480
WESLEY TARLE: So I don't see
any other questions, but I

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.400
think that people can take what
they learned from getting

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.130
started and play around with our
other APIs, and tune into

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:13.790
future episodes of Google
Developers Live to learn more.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:14.030
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:17.590
So we've shown you how to get
started with Android using

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:19.730
Google+ Sign-In.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.060
All of the things we
talked about are on

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.850
developers.google.com/plus,
and there's a lot more

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:27.970
resources there.

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:32.040
If you have any more
questions--

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:32.670
WESLEY TARLE: Yeah.

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:37.020
So there's more code for
different platforms and

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:39.980
languages at GitHub.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:44.900
You can ask questions at Google+
Developers Community,

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:50.430
or at Stack Overflow with
the tag Google+.

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:51.680
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.510
We're on that every day, and
we're really trying to make

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:59.110
sure that we can help you become
successful and use your

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.830
applications.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:04.880
WESLEY TARLE: Before we go,
I think that you had a big

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.109
announcement today.

00:17:06.109 --> 00:17:06.849
CHRIS CARTLAND: Oh yes.

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:13.400
Today, Janrain and Gigya
launched with Google+ Sign-In.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.500
They are companies that allow
you, as developers, to

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:20.589
implement Google+ Sign-In on
your websites, even if you

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:23.040
don't want to do the work of
implementing Google+ Sign-In.

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:28.500
So you can use their services
to configure many login

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.300
options, and Google+ is now
available with them.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:36.930
For example, I know that NPR,
National Public Radio, has

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:38.780
Google+ Sign-In enabled
as of today.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:39.060
WESLEY TARLE: Cool.

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:39.270
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah.

00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:40.520
It's very exciting.

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:46.220
WESLEY TARLE: I don't think
there are any more questions,

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:48.200
so thanks a lot for
having me on.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:48.910
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah,
thanks for coming.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:51.500
I'm glad you could
make it today.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:54.480
Yeah, well thanks everyone
for watching, and

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.730
tune in next week.
