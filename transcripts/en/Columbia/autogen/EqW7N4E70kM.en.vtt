that you had one colonialism that goes

Berbers and Arabs are different you have

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:23.580
Berbers and Arabs are different you have
 

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.000
Berbers and Arabs are different you have
a second colonialism that goes to the

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:26.010
a second colonialism that goes to the
 

00:24:26.010 --> 00:24:28.460
a second colonialism that goes to the
19th century that says Berbers and Arabs

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:28.470
19th century that says Berbers and Arabs
 

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:30.830
19th century that says Berbers and Arabs
are different even though the vector of

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840
are different even though the vector of
 

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.940
are different even though the vector of
difference is reversed goes from Arab

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:34.950
difference is reversed goes from Arab
 

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:38.150
difference is reversed goes from Arab
superiority to Berber superiority and in

00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:38.160
superiority to Berber superiority and in
 

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:46.210
superiority to Berber superiority and in
both cases it's a it appears to be a an

both cases it's a it appears to be a an
 

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:51.380
both cases it's a it appears to be a an

00:24:59.530 --> 00:24:59.540
 

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:01.790

it's very difficult to think how will be
like because this is twenty five after

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:32.710
like because this is twenty five after
 

01:13:32.710 --> 01:13:35.070
like because this is twenty five after
five and I don't have to think about

01:13:35.070 --> 01:13:35.080
five and I don't have to think about
 

01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.770
five and I don't have to think about
what will be like until Thursday but

01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:37.780
what will be like until Thursday but
 

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.390
what will be like until Thursday but
given two days who knows what will

01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:39.400
given two days who knows what will
 

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.429
given two days who knows what will
happen
