00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:06.620
Okay, story time

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.460
About 15 years ago, I was just about to get married and

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.990
Like in the tux is the whole bit, and my dad looks at me, and he says, "Son,

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:22.448
"no matter what your wife makes to eat, you eat it, and you ask for seconds no questions asked." Well a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.550
strange thing happened. I'm in this small town that I used to live in, like immediately after we got married

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.610
And we didn't have much money, and we had to just save as much as we could by shopping at the Benton debt store

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.610
So this is the bit indent store that we used to shop at and

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:45.189
One day my wife, though it would be a good idea to economize on one particular product that you just don't economize on and

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.529
It was a defining moment in our marriage, so let's go see if they have it still.

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:07.089
Here we go. Sauces, it's on this aisle. I've got to say the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:16.119
The quality of this grocery store has gone through the roof, like they're, they're selling good stuff these days look how shiny the floor is

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.049
But here we go all right, this is the Sloppy Joe there it is

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.620
This

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.819
Was a turning point in my marriage, and if I get this for my wife. She's instantly going to know what this means

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.140
What are you doing all?

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:47.140
Right so I got something for you. Yeah, I want to see what you think about it. You know where I shopped right?

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.739
I just okay. I didn't know where you shopped. Please please say . . .

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.670
It's the worst meal I've ever made ever would you like to explain the history of this?

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.519
So

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:12.099
When we were first married we didn't have a lot of money, and I shopped at

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.820
basically the bent and dent grocery store and

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.980
one night made some sloppy joes not with manwich, but with a dented can of

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.180
the off-brand at the store, so . . .

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.389
And I made it, and I took a bite of it. And the first bite I took I

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.760
Got up from the dinner table

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.940
I threw my entire sandwich out. And said that I refused to eat dinner even though I cooked it and you on the other hand

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:51.189
ate the sandwich and asked for seconds in fear that I would never cook again, and what did that do for our marriage?

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:53.960
We're 15 years in there in the future. What's happening right here

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.060
Yes, so did that play out well for me?

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.540
It did play out well for you: very well for you.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.860
all right so . . .

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.380
Young man, young woman, if your spouse cooks for you

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.100
Eat it and ask for seconds even if it's awful and she stands up and throws it away yourself

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.160
smarter every day.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.420
I thought you'd like that

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.260
That's very funny.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.620
Isn't that cool?

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.280
Did you have to hunt it down?

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.020
I did.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.060
That store has changed by the way.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.020
How could it have changed?

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.000
It's like, it's got like really good products now

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.520
It was literally dented cans.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.880
Yeah, it's it's like really nice now. What is this?

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.880
It was a Parmesan chicken.

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.020
Nice

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.720
And roasted potatoes . . .

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.440
That's what I'm talking about

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.520
and there's spinach salad under here.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.720
And I have added into

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.500
a hello fresh with some corn and the feta cheese.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.900
Sounds good to me

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.940
Gall, those potatoes are good, hey!

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.220
You cook a lot better now.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.220
It's a lot healthier, too

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.160
This place has changed.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.340
yes

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.820
How has it changed? Like it used to not be this good. Your products are better too, aren't they?

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.660
I would hope so.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.080
I think they are.
