00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.890
So, you're ready.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.738
You're eager to get started, and
you can't wait, and you've got nothing.

00:00:06.738 --> 00:00:08.022
Nada.

00:00:08.022 --> 00:00:09.625
Zilch.

00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:11.230
Zippo.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.300
I mean, this is your first app.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.340
It has to be amazing.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.570
Right?
I mean yes and no.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.700
I mean,
your first app is going to be amazing,

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.727
obviously because you're building it.

00:00:21.727 --> 00:00:23.714
But it doesn't have to change the world.

00:00:23.714 --> 00:00:26.240
It doesn't have to be some
groundbreaking thing.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.050
Take that pressure off yourself and

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.940
keep some of these key principals
in mind when you're brainstorming?

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.770
For one, what I just said.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.000
Your first app doesn't
have to change the world.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.910
You don't have to think of
some revolutionary amazing

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.400
thing that's going to feed children and
be awesome.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.740
Just don't worry about it.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.710
Two, find your motivation.

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.840
Find something you're passionate about
and you actually want to work on,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.590
because that's going to make
the process much, much, much easier.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.450
Otherwise if you're working on
something that you're not so

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.489
into, you might just stop halfway
through because why continue?

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.290
Then, keep it simple stupid.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.380
The simple kiss method.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.170
Don't think about a ton of features and
try to conclude everything,

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.710
because your just going to
probably end up with a clunky app

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.510
that nobody's going to be using.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.290
Then don't worry if your
idea already exists.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.230
That actually just means that
there's a market for it and

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.770
you know people want to use it.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.730
Most importantly,
this is your first app, not your last.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.150
So, if it's not your
crowning achievement,

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.340
that's okay, because there are many iOS
apps that you will build in the future.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.480
Now, you're going to move forward and

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.960
start brainstorming some ideas for
your app.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.290
Now I would recommend that you
always keep a piece of paper, or

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.080
your phone, or
some note taking app handy,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.290
because you never know when
inspiration might strike.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.380
Let's go think up some ideas.
