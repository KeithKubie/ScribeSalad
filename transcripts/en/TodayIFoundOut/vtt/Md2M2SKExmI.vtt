00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:11.740
Do Cow Farts Really Significantly Contribute
to Global Warming?

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.140
There are currently approximately 1.3 to 1.5
billion cows grazing, sleeping, and chewing

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.130
their cud at any given time on planet Earth.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.080
And these 1,300 pound (average weight for
both a beef and dairy cow) animals eat a lot.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.770
Much like humans, when they eat, gas builds
up inside of their guts and has to be expelled.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.129
(See Why Beans Make You Fart) Cows fart and
burp… a lot.

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.260
The result is a large amount of methane being
introduced into the atmosphere.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.820
In a 2006 United Nations’ Food and Agricultural
Organization report, it claims that the livestock

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.589
sector, most of which are cows, “generates
more greenhouse gas emissions as measured

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.530
in CO2 equivalent – 18 percent – than
transport.”

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.809
According to a Danish study, the average cow
produces enough methane per year to do the

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.620
same greenhouse damage as four tons of carbon
dioxide.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.950
So is this significantly contributing to global
warming?

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.160
Let’s start with how and why cows produce
so much methane gas.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.730
Cows, sheep, goats, giraffes, and deer belong
to a class of mammals called ruminants.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.760
Most ruminants have four stomachs, two-toed
feet, and store their food in the first chamber

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.700
of the stomach, called the rumen, before regurgitating
it.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.780
This regurgitated food is called “cud”
and the animals chew it again to help further

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.280
break it down to make it easier to digest.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.930
Inside of the rumen, over four hundred different
kinds of microbes exist that also play a critical

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.540
role in the digestion process.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.510
Several of these microbes create methane gas
as a byproduct.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.410
Due to the sheer number of cows on the planet,
along with the large size per cow, our tasty

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.620
friends produce more methane gas than all
other ruminants combined.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.220
Why could this potentially be bad?

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.490
Methane is twenty one times more potent at
trapping heat from the Sun than carbon dioxide.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.850
Though it is less prevalent in the atmosphere
than carbon dioxide, it is, by unit, the most

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.340
destructive of the greenhouse gases.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.599
Since the turn of the 19th century, methane
gas emissions have increased by 150%, according

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.980
to NASA’s Goddard Institute.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.040
Methane gas, like all other greenhouse gases
(which includes water vapor), acts like a

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.189
blanket around our planet, trapping heat.

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:33.230
The right amount and the planet has an average
temperature of a life-supporting 59 degrees

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.230
Fahrenheit.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.620
Too little and the greenhouse effect becomes
weak, like on Mars.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:44.109
Too much and the surface of the planet becomes
so hot “it can melt lead,” like on Venus.

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:48.650
Livestock is the largest source of methane
gas emissions worldwide, contributing over

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.959
28 percent of total emissions.

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.519
Wetlands, leaks from oil refineries and drills,
and landfills also contribute methane gas

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:57.519
to the atmosphere.

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.430
In fact, unlike the ratios on a global scale,
in the United States livestock is only the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.239
third largest contributor, behind the mining
and transportation of natural gas and rotting

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.239
landfill waste.

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.389
In actuality it’s not as much the farting
that’s the problem, cows’ burping and

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.799
manure contribute more methane gas than flatulence.

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.830
According to researchers at New Zealand’s
largest Crown Research Institute, AGResearch,

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.749
up to 95 percent of the emissions comes from
the cow’s mouth rather than its behind.

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:31.769
It’s estimated, through whichever orifice,
that each individual cow lets out between

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.700
thirty and fifty gallons of methane per day.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:41.170
With an estimated 1.3 to 1.5 billion cattle
in the world today, this adds up fast.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.200
Exactly how significant this it to our global
environment isn’t something that anyone

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.330
can easily put a number on, but the EPA, NASA,
various global agriculture organizations,

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:55.599
and the United Nations all recognize that
this is a real problem.

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.379
In recent years, several different solutions
have been proposed.

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.599
Scientists and experts have experimented with
cows’ diets to see if that could help cut

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.779
down on the amount of methane gas.

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:10.989
For instance, Welsh scientists studied the
effects of putting garlic into cows’ feed.

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.909
According to BBC News, “Garlic directly
attacks the organisms in the gut that produce

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:16.909
methane.”

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:19.489
So far, results have been positive.

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.031
Researchers have also studied adding plants
that are high in tannins to the diet, which

00:04:24.031 --> 00:04:27.360
are believed to lower methane levels in ruminants.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.590
Another branch of study focuses on not lowering
the amount of methane gas, but figuring out

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.319
a way to contain it and repurpose it.

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:39.901
Some farms have experimented with having their
livestock live in a plastic bubble, which

00:04:39.901 --> 00:04:43.710
takes the expelled gas and converts it into
electricity.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.220
But this process is both expensive, inefficient,
and considered somewhat inhumane, forcing

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.960
animals to live inside an artificial bubble.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.110
Methane gas emitted by cows and other livestock
does have a significant impact on the amount

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.280
of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere, which
are the main culprits behind climate change

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.610
and global warming.

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.919
While farts aren’t the only way cows are
expelling methane, it is, at least, accurate

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:20.979
to say that cow farts play a part in our planet’s
climate growing hotter.
