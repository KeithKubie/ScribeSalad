00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.675
- [Instructor] The function h is defined

00:00:01.675 --> 00:00:06.018
for all real numbers in
the graph y is equal to

00:00:06.018 --> 00:00:08.118
h of x, right over here.

00:00:08.118 --> 00:00:09.890
That's what they're showing us.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.851
And they ask us, what
is a reasonable estimate

00:00:11.851 --> 00:00:15.585
for the limit as x approaches
negative seven of h of x,

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:17.774
and they give us some choices
for those reasonable estimates

00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:20.699
including the possibility
that the limit does not exist.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.092
So encourage you to pause the video

00:00:22.092 --> 00:00:24.697
and see if you can work
through this yourself.

00:00:24.697 --> 00:00:27.293
All right, now let's think
about what's going on.

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:31.539
So something is interesting
at x equals negative seven.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.095
At x equals negative seven,
we have the function.

00:00:35.095 --> 00:00:38.833
It is defined, but it is not continuous

00:00:38.833 --> 00:00:40.754
with the rest of the function.

00:00:40.754 --> 00:00:42.959
H of negative seven,

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:43.792
h of

00:00:44.908 --> 00:00:46.408
negative seven is,

00:00:47.603 --> 00:00:49.690
looks like a little bit,

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.403
it looks like it's like
negative four point something.

00:00:52.403 --> 00:00:56.084
So it's approximately negative four point,

00:00:56.084 --> 00:00:57.837
I don't know, looks like negative

00:00:57.837 --> 00:01:01.250
4.1 something, something, something.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.129
So that's what h of negative seven is.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.519
And sometimes there's this temptation

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.137
to say, oh, whatever the function equals,

00:01:07.137 --> 00:01:08.935
that must be what the limit is.

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.886
But this is actually a really good example

00:01:10.886 --> 00:01:12.586
for showing the difference,

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:16.605
that many times, the limit
exists and is approaching

00:01:16.605 --> 00:01:19.104
or it is a value different
than what the value

00:01:19.104 --> 00:01:21.969
that the function takes on at that point.

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:24.071
And so let's think about the limit.

00:01:24.071 --> 00:01:27.041
As x approaches negative seven

00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:29.303
from smaller values of x,

00:01:29.303 --> 00:01:32.649
so as x gets closer and
closer to negative seven,

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.129
it looks like the value of
our function is approaching

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:37.695
where we have this gap.

00:01:37.695 --> 00:01:40.641
So it looks like our
function is getting closer,

00:01:40.641 --> 00:01:44.705
the value of our function
is approaching this value

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.038
right over here.

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:51.379
Similarly, if we were to
approach from the left,

00:01:51.379 --> 00:01:54.230
so for approach from more negative values,

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.944
it looks like the value of our function

00:01:56.944 --> 00:01:58.915
is approaching that same thing.

00:01:58.915 --> 00:02:01.618
And since it looks like it's
approaching the same value

00:02:01.618 --> 00:02:03.588
whether we're coming
from more negative values

00:02:03.588 --> 00:02:05.907
or less negative values,

00:02:05.907 --> 00:02:08.277
we know, or we can assume,

00:02:08.277 --> 00:02:10.800
or we have a good sense
that this limit exists.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.707
We seem to be approaching the same value.

00:02:12.707 --> 00:02:14.012
Now, it's a value different

00:02:14.012 --> 00:02:15.759
than the actual value
of the function there.

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:17.939
The value of the function
there is at negative 4.1

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.432
or something like that.

00:02:19.432 --> 00:02:24.319
Now, this looks like the
function itself is approaching,

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.397
this looks like, I don't, one point,

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:28.230
1.2,

00:02:29.182 --> 00:02:31.728
1.3, something like that.

00:02:31.728 --> 00:02:33.398
So now, let's look at our choices.

00:02:33.398 --> 00:02:37.334
What's a reasonable
estimate for this limit?

00:02:37.334 --> 00:02:39.087
Well, it's definitely not negative seven.

00:02:39.087 --> 00:02:41.078
The function is definitely not approaching

00:02:41.078 --> 00:02:42.932
y equals negative seven.

00:02:42.932 --> 00:02:44.516
This is kind of a distractor choice

00:02:44.516 --> 00:02:46.956
because this is what x is approaching.

00:02:46.956 --> 00:02:48.459
X is approaching negative seven,

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.821
but we want to know what is
the function approaching?

00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:52.627
What is the value of h approaching

00:02:52.627 --> 00:02:54.356
as x approaches negative seven?

00:02:54.356 --> 00:02:56.547
So let's rule that one out.

00:02:56.547 --> 00:02:57.630
Negative 4.1,

00:02:59.088 --> 00:03:02.227
so negative 4.1 is an interesting choice

00:03:02.227 --> 00:03:03.816
because that's a good approximation

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:07.296
for what the actual value
of the function is there.

00:03:07.296 --> 00:03:09.257
The function is defined there,

00:03:09.257 --> 00:03:12.328
although it kind of jumps and
is defined right over here,

00:03:12.328 --> 00:03:14.396
and it's discontinuous.

00:03:14.396 --> 00:03:16.854
So this is more of what h,

00:03:16.854 --> 00:03:20.304
this could be a reasonable
estimate for h of negative seven,

00:03:20.304 --> 00:03:22.742
what the function
actually is defined to be

00:03:22.742 --> 00:03:24.408
at x equals negative seven.

00:03:24.408 --> 00:03:26.541
But as we approach x equals,

00:03:26.541 --> 00:03:30.093
as we approach negative
seven, it is not approaching,

00:03:30.093 --> 00:03:31.725
the value of the function does not seem

00:03:31.725 --> 00:03:33.726
to be approaching negative 4.1.

00:03:33.726 --> 00:03:35.707
So I'm gonna rule that one out.

00:03:35.707 --> 00:03:37.922
Now, 1.3, that is what,

00:03:37.922 --> 00:03:39.791
that is a pretty reasonable estimate

00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:42.151
for what the function
seems to be approaching

00:03:42.151 --> 00:03:44.830
as x gets closer and
closer to negative seven

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:46.575
'cause, you know, 6.9, 6.99,

00:03:46.575 --> 00:03:50.509
or negative 6.9, negative
6.99, negative 6.9999,

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:52.219
from the right or from the left,

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:54.851
negative 7.1, negative 7.01,

00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:57.564
negative 7.001, so on and so forth.

00:03:57.564 --> 00:04:01.049
It looks like the value of
that function is approaching

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.046
approximately 1.3.

00:04:03.046 --> 00:04:04.541
So I like

00:04:04.541 --> 00:04:07.336
that choice right over there.

00:04:07.336 --> 00:04:09.785
1.8, well, that's just another choice

00:04:09.785 --> 00:04:12.269
but this, looking,
approximating where this is,

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.901
it definitely looks closer
to one than it does to two.

00:04:14.901 --> 00:04:16.326
So I'd rule that one out.

00:04:16.326 --> 00:04:17.962
And I would say that this limit does exist

00:04:17.962 --> 00:04:19.964
because it looks like we're
approaching the same value

00:04:19.964 --> 00:04:24.131
whether we're coming from below
or from above, so to speak.
