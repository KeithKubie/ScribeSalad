00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.300
Now, let's assume that we had the clause vertices connected to these variable gadgets here.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.630
Of course, in the same way that I showed you before, so that the clause vertex

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:17.490
can be visited like this--paying one extra edge instead of going here if the clause can be satisfied

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.190
and we're traveling along this gadget in the right way, then otherwise

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.480
it will cost us more than one edge.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:29.030
Now my question for you would be--so if the Boolean formula has a satisfying assignment,

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.020
what is the length of the shortest path from A to B, and by shortest path,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.400
I again mean one that visits all vertices.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:42.740
I want to give you the answer as before something times n plus some number times n

00:00:42.740 --> 99:59:59.000
plus some number times mn plus some constant.
