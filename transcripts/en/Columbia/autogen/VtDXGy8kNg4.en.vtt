these practices they should not stay
 

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:02.360
these practices they should not stay
forever right surely you don't want that

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:02.370
forever right surely you don't want that
 

01:00:02.370 --> 01:00:15.430
forever right surely you don't want that
that that's the argument that you make

01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440
 
 

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:18.320
 
I think you help me clarify something

name is Gary tartakov how much of our
 

01:00:23.850 --> 01:00:27.560
name is Gary tartakov how much of our
discussion and it's big discussion my

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:27.570
discussion and it's big discussion my
 

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:30.350
discussion and it's big discussion my
whole lifetime of difference how much a

01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:30.360
whole lifetime of difference how much a
 

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.570
whole lifetime of difference how much a
discussion of difference in this context

01:00:32.570 --> 01:00:32.580
discussion of difference in this context
 

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:35.900
discussion of difference in this context
of blacks and elites is an avoidance of

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:35.910
of blacks and elites is an avoidance of
 

01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:39.020
of blacks and elites is an avoidance of
the discussion of exploitation but it's

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:39.030
the discussion of exploitation but it's
 

01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:40.640
the discussion of exploitation but it's
easier to talk about color than it is

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:40.650
easier to talk about color than it is
 

01:00:40.650 --> 01:00:42.350
easier to talk about color than it is
exploitation or it's easier to talk

01:00:42.350 --> 01:00:42.360
exploitation or it's easier to talk
 

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:44.930
exploitation or it's easier to talk
about pollution than it is the

01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:44.940
about pollution than it is the
 

01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:47.140
about pollution than it is the
exploitation of those who are then

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:47.150
exploitation of those who are then
 

01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:51.530
exploitation of those who are then
called polluted well I think the your

01:00:51.530 --> 01:00:51.540
called polluted well I think the your
 

01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:53.270
called polluted well I think the your
question answers it and basically one

01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280
question answers it and basically one
 

01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.310
question answers it and basically one
requires that kind of investigation

01:00:55.310 --> 01:00:55.320
requires that kind of investigation
 

01:00:55.320 --> 01:01:00.050
requires that kind of investigation
continuously my concern is that the one

01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:00.060
continuously my concern is that the one
 

01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:02.630
continuously my concern is that the one
masquerades as the other repeatedly and

01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640
masquerades as the other repeatedly and
 

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:06.680
masquerades as the other repeatedly and
that's that's the escape from the task

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:06.690
that's that's the escape from the task
 

01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:11.240
that's that's the escape from the task
of the the critic and investigator which

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:11.250
of the the critic and investigator which
 

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:14.270
of the the critic and investigator which
must be to find how each one comes into

01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:14.280
must be to find how each one comes into
 

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:17.480
must be to find how each one comes into
place each one of those how they come

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:17.490
place each one of those how they come
 

01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:20.540
place each one of those how they come
into place because both exist very much

01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:20.550
into place because both exist very much
 

01:01:20.550 --> 01:01:23.510
into place because both exist very much
so but if you can talk about

01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:23.520
so but if you can talk about
 

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:27.620
so but if you can talk about
exploitation in one seminar and about

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:27.630
exploitation in one seminar and about
 

01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:29.180
exploitation in one seminar and about
color and another seminar you're safe

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:29.190
color and another seminar you're safe
 

01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:32.510
color and another seminar you're safe
you're fine you can talk about both of

01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:32.520
you're fine you can talk about both of
 

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.000
you're fine you can talk about both of
them many many people do and say it's

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:35.010
them many many people do and say it's
 

01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:37.310
them many many people do and say it's
exactly the same thing right

01:01:37.310 --> 01:01:37.320
exactly the same thing right
 

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.140
exactly the same thing right
it's exactly the same thing and you've

01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:39.150
it's exactly the same thing and you've
 

01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:46.550
it's exactly the same thing and you've
evaded the task once again they're

01:01:46.550 --> 01:01:46.560
evaded the task once again they're
 

01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:49.850
evaded the task once again they're
really different discrimination is mean

01:01:49.850 --> 01:01:49.860
really different discrimination is mean
 

01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:52.850
really different discrimination is mean
and unpleasant and sometimes against the

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:52.860
