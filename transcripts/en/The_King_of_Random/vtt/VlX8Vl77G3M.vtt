00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:02.219
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop

00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:05.669
Everybody loves cookies and they can be even more fun when you get to choose

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.540
What shape they're in sometimes you can't find just the right shape of cookie cutter so today

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.170
We're going to see if we can make our very own cookie cutters using aluminum cans

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.580
These cookie cutters will be made using aluminum cans a little bit of tape and a little bit of hot glue

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.040
We also have a couple of tools that we're gonna use to cut and shape the metal sheets

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.640
We have our cookie cutter making supplies

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.820
We've got some cookie dough to test it out on so let's get started to begin

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.080
I just want the flat sheets of aluminum that I can get from these cans so I'm going to start by cutting off the top

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:36.449
Cutting down the side and then cutting off the bottom and use the utility knife just to get the cut started and then I'll switch

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.450
to scissors

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.939
As you can see it's an extremely ragged cut, but we'll smooth that out in a second

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.479
With our sheet of aluminum cut out and now let's try and get rid of the ragged edges if you have any sort of straight

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.230
Edge, you can use that will help make sure your cuts are nice and clean, and you have nice straight lines

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.079
It's much better now one side that's completely nice and straight now. I'm just going to do the same thing on the other side

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.279
The blade was cutting into the metal just a little bit of an angle and it sliced out this little spiral

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.880
If you prefer not to use a utility knife you can also mark off where you want it to cut and then just use a

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.880
pair of scissors

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.959
Cutting the metal with both utility knife and the scissors

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.210
Could leave a sharp edge or some burrs that you could cut yourself on so just to get rid of those really quick

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.860
Let's take some extremely fine grit sandpaper and go over the edge of our cam so we don't cut ourselves

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.229
There we go now that we have our pieces of can cut out the edges straightened and all of the sharp edges

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.599
Removed with some sandpaper. We're ready to start forming these into shapes to cut cookies for the next step

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600
Let's cut off strips of the aluminum sheeting that are about one and a half inches wide

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.249
There we go now, we've got our strip, I'm just gonna quickly use the sandpaper again on the newly cut edge

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.949
Now I'm just going to mark every half inch on this inch and a half wide piece

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.009
So we're dividing it into three equal portions now

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.860
let's fold the top third down onto the second third this will reinforce our cookie cutter and make it a little bit stronger as we

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.940
Shape it lose the cap of my pen to sort of crease that down a little bit

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.910
Go we now have a strip of aluminum which is

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.620
Sturdier on the top and nice and thin on the bottom. Let's make a few more of those

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:54.330
There we go now

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.389
We've got several strips of our cut and reinforced strips of aluminum

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.129
now with the strips of metal what we want to do is bend them into the shape that we want our cookies to be I've

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.089
Got three different shapes here printed out, and I want to try and make cookies that match these shapes

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.679
Let's start with this star shape the goal is we're going to try to bend our aluminum sheets

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.250
To follow along the line that we have printed out now

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.089
I don't know if this one sheet of metal is going to be long enough to get around the whole pattern

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.199
but the nice thing is that if you run out you can take a second sheet and just

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.899
Nest it nicely into the first one

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.129
We'll then use a little bit of tape and a small dab of hot glue to secure the ends together

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.040
You can use my pen and just mark the next spot where I want to bend it that

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.470
Way I can take it off the paper

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.439
Hold it in my hands as I do the bending try bending it over my straight edge and see if that helps him

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.480
It makes a nice straight crease

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.240
One of the things you really want to watch out for is that you need to make sure that your creases are

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.840
perfectly perpendicular

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.260
To the direction of your metal if you accidentally make your fold to any sort of an angle you'll have a very hard time

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.839
Getting the bottom of your cookie cutter to stay flat

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.729
You can see that this strip of aluminum has run out and I haven't quite finished making my cookie cutter shape, so I'm going to

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.079
Take another piece of the aluminum attach it to this one and then just continue along the pattern

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:42.209
I'm going to use a small dot of hot glue just here in the seam to hold it together nicely

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.549
Now to reinforce it just a little bit more to make sure it doesn't pull apart

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.329
I'm almost going to use a little bit of this strong tape along the top

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.408
Just like that we have extended the size of our aluminum strip by double

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.310
Now I've clearly got too much metal strip right now

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.189
And I want to be able to line it up just right so it fits in here

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:14.128
So I'm first going to just give a rough cut right about there, and then I'll align it more perfectly after I do that

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.399
There we go we now have a nice star-shaped strip of metal now

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.669
Let's attach the ends here, so it holds itself together well instead of flopping around

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:35.119
If you do end up joining pieces of metal together check to make sure that the bottom is still nice and flush

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:40.489
If you have a little bit of a lip like I do here, you can just trim that off with a pair of scissors

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:42.990
Now at this point we have a star-shaped

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:48.469
Piece of metal that we should be able to press down into some cookie dough and give us a star-shaped cookie

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:51.349
Let's try out the exact same process with a couple other shapes

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:01.218
Now with this shape one piece of metal is pretty much the perfect size to go all the way around it

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:06.259
But I want to keep that point at the bottom of the heart shape and since I don't want to just tape these two together

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:09.949
I'm actually just going to take a small piece of another strip of metal and

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.339
Fit it onto both of them so we can keep that nice taper

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.809
You do have to be careful while pressing this together because the aluminium conducts heat pretty well

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.549
So it can heat up a lot if you're using a high-temperature glue these gloves are pretty thin

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.550
But they do stop my fingers from getting burned as I squeeze that together

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.250
Alright, that looks nice and attached then just for reinforcement. I'll put a strip of tape on the outside

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.570
And go nice heart shape

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.969
It's like curving this one, so I'm just going to try bending it around like ten

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:59.339
Looks like it's working pretty well all right. That's working alright. We just need a little patch a couple inches long to fill this out

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:08.459
Clearly too long of course, and you just going to do a rough cut when you measure better

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:23.300
That I think is a pretty good speech bubble

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:51.410
To test out your cookie cutters make or buy some sugar cookie dough prepare it as instructed and then start cutting them out

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.280
We get our shapes up onto a cookie sheet with have it deforming too much

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:21.659
Add a little flour we're gonna pretend. This is a spatula - not a cheese slicer

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.980
Flour helps

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.209
There we go, we've got our main cookie cutters

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:04.758
We've cut some cookies, and we've got those baking and while those are cooking

00:09:04.759 --> 00:09:08.029
I actually went ahead to try and push the creative boundaries of how

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:14.508
Detailed of a cookie cutter you can make with this so I have made a king of random crown symbol cookie cutter you

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.769
Might notice, there's a little bit less detail in this crown than in the original logo

00:09:19.079 --> 00:09:23.269
I'm not gonna be able to get all of those tiny little details into a cookie anyway

00:09:23.399 --> 00:09:28.818
However to make sure I do have the little round points on the tip of the crown. I have this secondary little tube

00:09:28.819 --> 00:09:33.349
I'm just gonna cut out a little circle at the top of each one so let's roll out a little bit more cookie dough and

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.350
See how well this thing works

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:42.949
And even just kind of lifting yourself out

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:51.229
Make sure all of the bits of the crown get pushed all the way down to the dough

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.370
Oh

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:04.250
Yeah, now let's take our little hole punch and cut out on top of the pack

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.040
Take off the extra dough pop these into the oven

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.139
Their shapes have puffed up quite a bit

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:42.510
Our first batch of shaped cookies is out of the oven I don't think this particular sugar cookie recipe is the very best

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:48.510
from making custom shapes because they did kind of deform a little bit in the oven and I know that's pretty natural for that to

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:53.789
Happen a little bit these ones seemed to puddle and move around a little bit more than some however

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:59.970
You can still see the shape. We've got hearts stars, and these little speech bubbles and you know what they taste pretty good, too

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.589
I'm gonna take one of our speech bubble cookies

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:08.249
And I'm gonna add some decorative frosting which is one of the best parts of sugar cookies

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:17.099
Wow, that is yellow frosting all right spread some frosting on our speech bubble cookie here

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.600
Now I'm gonna take just a little bit of this

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:28.380
frosting add some different food coloring and then pipe it out so we can have some speech in our speech bubble and

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:33.090
Mix up a little bit of frosting here in this cup and a few drops of glue

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:37.259
You can turn this yellow frosting into a dark green frosting

00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:43.049
Got a little ziploc bag. We're gonna use that for piping out our frosting onto our speech bubble

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:49.650
This is of course not a real authentic piping bag

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.469
But I think it's going to work because we don't have all that much to right

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:55.740
Cut off a tiny bit of the corner

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:16.910
Well as I feared we definitely did lose some definition in those crowns now. It looks kind of more like a

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.540
jellyfish

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.710
inside a triangle

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:25.790
But that's alright the cookie cutter works great this particular cookie dough doesn't work amazingly

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:31.730
There you have it we have taken some soda cans cut them up into little strips of aluminum and folded them and molded them into

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:33.900
Just the right shape so we can use them as

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:40.009
Custom cookie cutters these things actually work really well they cut through the dough very nicely just because you have a thin metal edge

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:45.469
So it's really easy to get right through pick up a lot of detail and then they cook and you've got your shaped cookies this

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:49.249
Particular cookie dough does tend to deform a little bit, so you've got like a vague

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.579
Reminiscent shape of your cookies, but for the most part this worked really well

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.790
I'm pretty happy with it you can cut out your shapes decorate them with

00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:00.770
Frosting right draw put sprinkles on them whatever you want to do however you like your cookies

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:06.470
That's level Point is fully customizing this project is a lot of fun obviously doesn't take many supplies

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:10.189
It's basically just some empty soda cans and then you can make your own custom cookies

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.280
This is a great project that you should do at home, or at a friend's house

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.009
Or you know wherever you make cookies grandma's house

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.880
Thanks guys for joining us for this project, and we look forward to the next one talk to you then

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.790
King of random cookie with sort of a deformed crown

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:28.230
Shape in there

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:31.189
Sure, there's everyone out there on YouTube who has their own

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:35.960
Cooking and baking channel is just laughing at me for doing this completely the wrong way

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:37.700
Hey guys

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:40.460
Thank you for your comments so many of you have really interesting

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:46.129
Suggestions for projects and experiments, and we love testing those out for you. I also wanted to say thank you for the great feedback

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:50.630
You're leaving for me and my team because we are all in this together, so thank you for being on our team
