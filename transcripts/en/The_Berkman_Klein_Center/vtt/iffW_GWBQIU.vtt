bjbj 2011-09-12_wasteland [0:00:04] Martha
Minow: Good afternoon. If you don t have a

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:17.060
seat, please do take one. It is an enormous
pleasure for me to welcome you all here today

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.980
to this special event. I m Dean Martha Minow
here at Harvard Law School. A half century

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.920
ago, the 35-year-old federal regulator of
an agency most people had never heard of woke

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:38.640
up the public with a searing speech that to
this day is studied in rhetoric courses. It

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:46.610
s used in headlines. I happen to know it s
used on a LSAT reading comprehension test

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:54.520
and it is used in persistent assessments of
how communications technology affects entertainment

00:00:54.520 --> 00:01:02.530
and news, culture and democracy. In 1961,
Newton Minow, appointed by President John

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.690
F. Kennedy to chair the Federal Communications
Commission told the National Association of

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:15.640
Broadcasters, When television is good, nothing,
not the theater, not the magazines or newspapers,

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:23.110
nothing is better. But when television is
bad, nothing is worse. I invite each of you

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.799
to sit down in front of your television set
when you station goes on the air and stay

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:37.510
there for a day without a book, without a
magazine, without a newspaper, without a profit

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.729
and loss sheet or a rating book to distract
you. Keep your eyes glued to that set until

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.940
the station signs off. And here it comes,
I can assure you that what you will observe

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:58.560
is a vast wasteland, borrowing from T.S. Eliot
s great poem. Newton Minow challenged American

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.409
broadcasters actually to watch the shows that
they were putting out on the public air waves,

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:10.680
the game shows, the violence, the boredom;
and he shocked a complacent industry. He called

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:18.120
for imagination, excellence and creativity.
Fifty years later, we bring him here to meet

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.299
with the amazingly imaginative, excellent
and creative individuals who will participate

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:30.120
in today s program. They include remarkable
people from the Berkman Center for Internet

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.890
and Society which is rooted here in the law
school while reaching the university and the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.950
world, extraordinary journalists who will
explore with us where we are now, a vaster

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.100
wasteland or a new greatness when it comes
to entertainment and news, policy makers,

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.850
other former regulators, imaginative theorists.
You are in for a treat, those of you who are

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.130
here. I want to give my personal thanks to
the participants from the Berkman Center,

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.980
John Palfrey, Terry Fisher, Yochai Benkler,
Jonathan Zittrain, Urs Gasser and so many

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.160
others who made this event happen. You are
all stars and I give special thanks to all

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.320
of you. m so pleased also to welcome Ann Marie
Lipinski here and also to Harvard, now the

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.250
head of the Nieman Foundation which co-sponsors
this event. She s a Pulitzer Prize winning

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.320
journalist and active participant in constructing
new models of non-profit newsgathering and

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.650
distribution and she brings the eye of a writer,
the judgment of an editor and the wisdom of

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.400
someone who has survived the tumult in both
the newspaper business and the academic world.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.160
Jonathan Alter will also be here. He has been
described as the most astute political observer

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.910
in his generation. He too an award-winning
and best-selling author, now at Bloomberg

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:59.060
News after 28 years at Newsweek and on Twitter
I happen to know personally. Susan Crawford,

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.790
expert on internet governance and information
regulation. Perry Hewitt, expert on the digital

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:14.220
world and social networking. Nicholas Negroponte,
the remarkable, inspiring figure from the

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:23.430
MIT Media Lab and the One Laptop per Child
initiative. Tim Wu, whose studies of information

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:32.480
empires have rocked the world anew. Ellen
Goodman, information analyst par excellence.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.230
I am so thrilled you re all here and I promise
I will sit down in a second so the discussion

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:43.170
really starts but I do have a point of personal
privilege which takes me back to Newton Minow.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.410
A veteran of World War Two, Minow learned
the significance of global communication during

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:54.360
his service in the China Burma India Theater
during that war. He built a career spanning

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.361
law, politics, the academy and business while
helping to build and criticize the [0:05:00]

00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:05.760
news communication world. He has chaired the
Public Broadcasting Service. He helped to

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.630
fund Sesame Street. He has advised networks
and cable companies. He s an architect and

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.960
statesman of the presidential debates televised
and video streamed on the internet in this

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.640
country for decades, of counsel to the law
firm Sidley Austin Brown and Wood, long time

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:27.480
university professor at Northwestern University.
He is the husband of Jo Minow who is here

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:35.840
today and they are my beloved parents. T.S.
Eliot who gave dad the phrase vast wasteland

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.690
also said, It is in fact a part of the function
of education to help us to escape, not from

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.540
our own time for we are bound by that, but
from the intellectual and emotional limitations

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.970
of our time. I look forward to this session
in precisely that spirit and I m delighted

00:05:53.970 --> 00:06:11.920
to welcome Newton Minow here to Harvard Law
School. [Applause] Newton Minow: Thank you,

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:23.870
Martha. What greater honor can a father have
than to have his daughter say some nice things

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:35.889
about him, even if they re not true? I also
thank our son who is here, Joe Singer. I don

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:41.830
t call him my son-in-law. Martha s husband,
a distinguished faculty member; and a dear

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:50.700
friend surprised me by coming here today,
Doris Kearns Goodwin. Doris, you [Applause]

00:06:50.700 --> 00:07:00.120
Newton Minow: If you haven t read her book
about Lincoln, you must. President Obama has

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:12.210
it at his bedside. I m very much an admirer
of the Berkman Center. It s the first of its

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:20.500
kind that I know of in this country and its
work is not only substantive. It s creative.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:26.490
It s imaginative. It s highly respected. I
wish it had existed when I was chairman of

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:34.810
the FCC. I knew the Berkman family. They were
broadcasters when I was at the FCC in Ohio.

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:43.230
They had a very high sense of the public interest
and public service. When I agreed to come

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:49.930
here today, I hadn t focused on the date.
I didn t realize it was going to be one day

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:57.830
after 9/11 and like all of you, yesterday
was a very emotional one for me. Our firms

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:06.410
and New York office was in the World Trade
Center. We had 677 people there and when it

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:14.570
was all over, the office manager got everyone
to the first floor and we said, Fortunately,

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:20.139
we only lost one person, a receptionist who
somehow disappeared after they got to the

00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:27.320
first floor. Today, we say, Unfortunately
we lost one person. Also [0:08:26] [Indiscernible]

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:33.789
was a member of the board of directors of
the Aon Corporation which had 900 people in

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:45.190
the building and lost 177; and yesterday,
I read in the Chicago Tribune at home an interview

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:53.570
with the former CEO of Aon who said he was
brought to tears this week when he got two

00:08:53.570 --> 00:09:02.290
letters. One from a freshman at Columbia University,
one from a freshman at Tufts thanking Aon

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:11.360
for making it possible to have scholarships
for all the children of those who died there.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:17.780
So it s something really to think about. In
terms of communications, do you realize that

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:31.190
10 years ago there was no YouTube video? Ten
years ago, there were no cameras and cell

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:38.230
phones. Ten years ago, there were no tweets.
There was no Twitter. That was 10 years ago.

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:46.140
Then let s talk about 50 years ago when most
of you were not even born. What was it like

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:55.290
for me as a young person to be sent by President
Kennedy to the Federal Communications Commission?

00:09:55.290 --> 00:10:06.480
At that time, phone calls went by wire. [0:10:00]
Broadcasting went through the air. Today,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:13.620
as Professor Negroponte has pointed out, something
we should have all seen, until he observed

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:20.850
it himself, most phone calls go through the
air and most people get their television service

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:29.150
either by wire or by satellite. It had been
a fundamental basic transformation in the

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:35.480
world of communications and yet, there have
been very little thinking about what that

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:44.380
really means. In 1961, there were two and
a half television networks. There was one

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:54.390
telephone company. There were no personal
computers. There was no public television.

00:10:54.390 --> 00:11:05.080
There was no public radio. FM radio was dormant.
Cable was fledgling. There was no internet

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:12.100
and usually, there was only one television
set in a home. It was a small black and white

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:20.550
set and the entire family watched the same
program at the same time. Audience was passive.

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:30.370
They listened or watched silently. There were
scandals in the broadcasting industry, bad

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:38.800
scandals in the 50s involving payola, involving
scams of various kinds. There were scandals

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:46.050
at the FCC. President Kennedy s predecessor,
President Eisenhower, had to fire the chairman

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:52.380
of the FCC for improper conduct. [0:11:49]
[Indiscernible] the industry and the agency

00:11:52.380 --> 00:12:02.500
were both in bad trouble. On May 5th of that
year, there was a great triumph, the successful

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:11.460
launch of the first American in space, Commander
Alan Shepard. On May 8th, Shepard returned

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:18.730
from space and he came to see President Kennedy
in his office and they were then going to

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:24.720
go to congress. On the same day, President
Kennedy was to speak to the National Association

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:32.740
of Broadcasters and he had called and invited
me to ride with him to his speech and I was

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:39.690
to meet him outside the Oval Office. I was
waiting for him. President Kennedy came out

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:44.440
and he said, Newt. He said, The Shepards are
here. He said, What do you think about taking

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:50.660
them to the broadcasters convention? I said,
That would be perfect. That would mean everything.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:55.381
He said, Well, and wait a minute. He said,
Let me go in and arrange it and I ll come

00:12:55.381 --> 00:13:02.141
back and I ll get you. He came back out and
he said, OK, it s all set. Come with me though.

00:13:02.141 --> 00:13:08.590
I want to change my shirt. So he took me upstairs
to the living quarters of the White House

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:13.810
and even though I had known the president
before, I was scared to death. Here I was

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:19.339
with the president of the United States, watching
him change his shirt and he said to me he

00:13:19.339 --> 00:13:26.730
said, What do you think I should say to the
broadcasters? as if he hadn t given it any

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:33.100
thought before; and I said, I think you ought
to tell them the difference between a free

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:40.250
society and a closed society. The Soviets
sent people into space but you really never

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:46.560
know if it was successful or it wasn t. There
was no radio and television there to cover

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:54.490
it but in our country, we let everybody see
and hear what was going on. So you ought to

00:13:54.490 --> 00:14:00.760
talk about what the contribution broadcasting
made to our citizens to understand this new

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:05.810
world. The president didn t say anything.
He didn t say that s good or that s bad. He

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:11.500
finished changing his shirt. We went downstairs
and took me in the Oval Office and there were

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:16.649
Commander Shepard and his wife and there was
Vice President Johnson. We were all going

00:14:16.649 --> 00:14:21.089
to go together and we went, walked out to
the driveway and I thought I would get in

00:14:21.089 --> 00:14:25.220
the second car because now we had the Shepards
and the vice president. The president says,

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:30.180
No, no, no. He says, Newt, come on. Just get
in the jump seat. He said, Lyndon, you get

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:36.250
in the other jump seat, and he put the Shepards
in the backseat with himself; and we drove

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:42.960
through Rock Creek Park up to what was then
called the Wardman Park Hotel. It s now called

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.830
the Sheraton Park Hotel and the president
was in a very ebullient mood. This was after

00:14:46.830 --> 00:14:51.850
the failure of the Bay of Pigs. Here is something
that had gone right. We had a success. We

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:58.780
were catching up with the Russians so he slapped
Lyndon on the shoulder and he said, Lyndon,

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:04.820
you are the chairman of the [0:15:00] National
Space Council, and the vice president said,

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:09.839
Yes. The president said, Yes, but nobody knows
that Lyndon. But he said, I guarantee you,

00:15:09.839 --> 00:15:14.300
Lyndon. If this had been a failure, if that
space shot had been a failure, I would have

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:25.221
seen to it that everybody [Laughter] Newton
Minow: Lyndon didn t laugh and I [Laughter]

00:15:25.221 --> 00:15:28.720
Newton Minow: But I was next to him at the
other jump seat and unfortunately, I have

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:34.570
a big mouth. I couldn t resist it. So I said,
Mr. President. I said, If it had been a failure,

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:44.800
the vice president would have been the next
astronaut. [Laughter] Newt Minow: Which the

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:50.370
vice president didn t think was very funny
either. [Laughter] Newt Minow: When we got

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:57.529
there, the president gave a three-minute,
perfectly-timed, a perfectly-phrased speech

00:15:57.529 --> 00:16:04.300
about the difference between a free society
and a closed society, about how broadcasting

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:11.060
had allowed every American to see what was
going on. He got a standing ovation. The next

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:18.970
day, I came to speak and I think the broadcaster
wished I had changed my shirt because there

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:32.370
was no standing ovation. Now why did I give
that speech? Television had become, in 1961,

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:38.459
the dominant form of communication in our
country. Everybody could afford it and that

00:16:38.459 --> 00:16:46.370
was most people had a television set. The
Kennedy-Nixon debate on television in 1960

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:52.861
had, in my opinion and in the opinion of President
Kennedy, decided the election. Television

00:16:52.861 --> 00:16:58.740
had become extremely important but there had
been very little discussion or debate in the

00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:07.750
country about what that meant in terms of
public responsibility, public interest and

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:14.489
I was determined even though I knew that my
speech would not be welcomed. My favorite

00:17:14.489 --> 00:17:20.679
response was from a man named Sherwood Schwartz
who was the producer of a program called Gilligan

00:17:20.679 --> 00:17:28.459
s Island. He sent me a message because he
named the sinking ship after me, the S.S.

00:17:28.459 --> 00:17:38.940
Minnow. [Laughter] Newt Minow: But I knew
what I was getting into and now that was 50

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:46.690
years ago and what I decided the government
s role should be and this is what I hope we

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:54.049
ll get into here. The government s role, I
felt, was to expand choice, to open up new

00:17:54.049 --> 00:17:59.529
channels. We opened up the UHF channels. We
asked congress to pass a bill that required

00:17:59.529 --> 00:18:05.470
that every television set could tune into
a UHF channel which quintupled the number

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:14.860
of television channels. We opened up cable.
Satellites were discovered. President Kennedy

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:20.020
took me on a tour of the space program and
he said to me, Why do you think these communication

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:25.350
satellites are so important? And I said, Mr.
President, they re more important than sending

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:31.669
a man into space. He said, Why is that? I
said, Communication satellites will send ideas

00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:39.140
into space and ideas last longer than people.
Communication satellites have fundamentally

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:46.340
changed we can see what s going on all over
the world and they can see us. All the things

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:52.179
that are happening in the Middle East, many
people believe, are really caused by the explosion

00:18:52.179 --> 00:19:00.110
in satellite communication. I felt it was
a disgrace that we had no public television.

00:19:00.110 --> 00:19:07.149
I came to the FCC from Chicago where we had
channel 11, a public station. President Kennedy

00:19:07.149 --> 00:19:13.630
came from Boston where there was WGBH. In
our ignorance, we thought every city had a

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:18.460
public television station. We found out there
was none in New York City, the largest city

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:23.980
in the country. There was none in Los Angeles,
the second largest city in the country. There

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:29.340
was none in Washington D.C., the nation s
capital. So we decided something had to be

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:36.369
done about that and we ve succeeded. Congress
passed the first legislation that helped create

00:19:36.369 --> 00:19:45.830
public television. We got stations going in
New York and Los Angeles and Washington and

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:52.049
I felt that after two years, I was going broke.
Martha was and her sisters. Martha was six

00:19:52.049 --> 00:20:02.019
years old. Her sisters were [Laughter] Newt
Minow: [0:20:00] Her older and younger sisters.

00:20:02.019 --> 00:20:06.830
I was I couldn t afford it anymore so I had
promised President Kennedy I would be there

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:12.799
for two years. Two years to the day, I asked
for an appointment to see him. I walked in.

00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:17.409
The president said, re the only guy I brought
here who never asked to see me. I know what

00:20:17.409 --> 00:20:21.320
you want. You want to go home. I said, That
s right, Mr. President. I can t afford it.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:27.739
He says, Are you sure you don t want another
job? I said, So I left but I felt I had accomplished

00:20:27.739 --> 00:20:38.429
a lot. After I left the government, I have
had a blessed life. I was chairman of the

00:20:38.429 --> 00:20:46.690
Public Broadcasting Service and was able to
build that system into what it is today. I

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:56.769
served on the board of CBS with Walter Cronkite
when the giants were still there. I served

00:20:56.769 --> 00:21:02.879
on the board of the Tribune Company. Ann Marie
Lipinski, Pulitzer Prize winner when the Tribune

00:21:02.879 --> 00:21:13.879
was winning Pulitzer Prizes instead of being
in bankruptcy. I was fortunate to serve and

00:21:13.879 --> 00:21:22.070
then become chairman of the Carnegie Foundation
which was a basic funder for a public broadcasting.

00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:28.289
So I ve had a blessed, fortunate life but
the most important thing that I want to urge

00:21:28.289 --> 00:21:36.179
a discussion about today is the future, not
the past. Thomas Jefferson said he liked the

00:21:36.179 --> 00:21:41.669
dreams of the future more than he liked thinking
about the past. Today you have a different

00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:47.960
world. My grandchildren tell me they don t
even have television sets. What they watched

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:56.989
is on their computer. You can carry your iPad
around and see what s going on. The internet

00:21:56.989 --> 00:22:05.259
is absolutely one of the most important inventions
of all time. There again I was lucky. I was

00:22:05.259 --> 00:22:11.330
on the board of the Rand Corporation when
the first work was done to create the internet

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:18.269
under a contract for the government. People
forget this. The government funded what is

00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:25.179
today we call the internet. There was a contract
led up by the Department of Defense and Rand

00:22:25.179 --> 00:22:31.840
developed what s called packet switching and
that now is the guts of enabling the internet

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:42.450
to work. m disappointed particularly today
by the media and politics and I hope we will

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:48.979
get to discuss this. Today s politics is dominated
by money. Most candidates spend most of their

00:22:48.979 --> 00:22:54.929
time raising money. Why do they need the money?
They need the money so they can buy radio

00:22:54.929 --> 00:23:02.999
and television time. So they re buying they
re raising money from the public to get access

00:23:02.999 --> 00:23:09.470
to something the public owns, the airwaves.
That s a crazy system. We re one of the few

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:16.830
countries in the world that does not provide
public service time to candidates. In England,

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:23.190
you cannot if you re a candidate, you cannot
purchase time. It s not allowed. That s true

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:29.399
in Japan. That s true in many countries in
Asia. It s true in Europe and we go with a

00:23:29.399 --> 00:23:37.960
system where the politics and the cost of
campaigning is really caused by the media.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:43.729
So I hope in our discussion now, I ve talked
long enough, we ll talk about that and we

00:23:43.729 --> 00:23:51.519
ll talk about many other issues. The Berkman
Center, I wish it existed 50 years ago. I

00:23:51.519 --> 00:23:56.780
heard a talk today. Some of the people from
the Berkman were there. The Knight Foundation

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:03.240
happens to be in town at Harvard and they
had a senior adviser to the FCC talking about

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:10.409
these issues and I said to him, I wish 50
years ago, we had the benefit of the brains

00:24:10.409 --> 00:24:19.479
dealing with these questions. When television
was developed in this country, the word television

00:24:19.479 --> 00:24:26.289
was not even added to the Communications Act
for 30 years. There was no debate in this

00:24:26.289 --> 00:24:33.110
country. There was no discussion of the public
responsibility. It has been neglected and

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:55.987
I hate to say it, it s neglected today. Thank
you. [Applause] Jonathan Zittrain: Newt, thank

00:24:55.987 --> 00:25:01.210
you so much for these opening remarks and
provocations. [0:25:00] It does seem like

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:08.109
you ve been sort of a hyper intelligent Forrest
Gump sort of in the present or the maybe the

00:25:08.109 --> 00:25:13.489
a Zelig we might say depending on our choice
of popular culture references but incredible

00:25:13.489 --> 00:25:20.029
that you ve been there for so much and been
such an actor amidst it too. As Martha said,

00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:25.039
this is one of those original speeches that
was said to have such an impact on the public

00:25:25.039 --> 00:25:32.850
discourse and what came later and it demonstrates
Mark Twain s admonition to us. Everybody is

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:37.039
always talking about the weather but nobody
ever does anything about it and you ve been

00:25:37.039 --> 00:25:42.019
doing something about the weather so Female
Speaker: Well, I got to go home [0:25:39]

00:25:42.019 --> 00:25:47.609
[Phonetic]. Jonathan Zittrain: Fair enough.
I ll stop the praise right now on advice of

00:25:47.609 --> 00:25:57.049
the counselor wife and instead, invite down
our three respondents to respond briefly to

00:25:57.049 --> 00:26:01.759
the provocation, to say a few things. So Ann
Marie Lipinski, Jonathan Alter and Yochai

00:26:01.759 --> 00:26:06.519
Benkler, come on down. Like game shows is
one of the things you didn t like but it does

00:26:06.519 --> 00:26:12.479
have that sort of feel to it. So great to
meet you. Thank you. Jonathan Alter: Nice

00:26:12.479 --> 00:26:18.299
to meet you. Jonathan Zittrain: Please have
a seat. Very pleased to meet you. Ann Marie

00:26:18.299 --> 00:26:24.479
Lipinski: Nice to meet you. Jonathan Zittrain:
Hi. So, Ann Marie, why don t we start with

00:26:24.479 --> 00:26:29.119
you? You are the curator-designate of the
Nieman Foundation. Tell us what that means.

00:26:29.119 --> 00:26:33.349
Ann Marie Lipinski: m the actual curator.
Jonathan Zittrain: Oh, no longer the curator-designate.

00:26:33.349 --> 00:26:36.359
Wikipedia has fallen behind, it seems. [Laughter]
Jonathan Zittrain: Could somebody Male Speaker:

00:26:36.359 --> 00:26:41.779
ll fix that right away. Jonathan Zittrain:
Yes, we re fixing that right now. [Laughter]

00:26:41.779 --> 00:26:48.840
Jonathan Zittrain: I should also say speaking
of dynamic, the things this has been webcast

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.970
so it s going out through the satellites into
the ether. Who knows what s going to happen

00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:58.039
to it next. So if for some reason you don
t want to be captured on film, first, don

00:26:58.039 --> 00:27:02.080
t say anything. It would draw attention and
other, you might actually want to leave the

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:08.470
room completely; but other than that, if you
are on Twitter, on the opposite side of things

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:13.109
and would like to be noticed, we have decided
that perhaps hashtag vast wasteland would

00:27:13.109 --> 00:27:18.070
be the right Twitter tag for this event. Anyway,
Ann Marie, you were saying Ann Marie Lipinski:

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:21.580
Yes. Jonathan Zittrain: you are currently
the curator at the Nieman Foundation. Just

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:25.080
tell us what that means and then feel free
to lead right into your response. Ann Marie

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:31.129
Lipinski: So it I have no paintings that I
m in charge of but I am in charge of a program

00:27:31.129 --> 00:27:36.200
about journalism and it is one of Harvard
s great contributions. It s a program that

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:43.659
has been here for 75 years endowed by the
family that owned the paper in Milwaukee and

00:27:43.659 --> 00:27:48.970
their idea was to bring to Harvard people
uniquely unqualified [0:27:47] [Phonetic]

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:54.970
for journalism, whatever that meant and means,
and to give them access to this amazing institution

00:27:54.970 --> 00:28:01.100
for a year to grow as journalists and thereby
improve the profession. Jonathan Zittrain:

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:04.659
So you get to fill the box of chocolates.
Ann Marie Lipinski: I do and I have some of

00:28:04.659 --> 00:28:08.490
the chocolates here tonight. A bunch of my
fellows are in the room. So, can I tell one

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:12.360
quick story on the Minows? Jonathan Zittrain:
Of course, of course. Ann Marie Lipinski:

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:21.179
So you saw tonight why we love Newt. So he
s a great storyteller and language is very

00:28:21.179 --> 00:28:26.340
important to him and narrative is very important
to him which is why we pay attention. It s

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:32.239
not just ideas. It s the way he conveys and
compels those ideas but one I a couple of

00:28:32.239 --> 00:28:39.789
years ago, I was actually sitting shiva with
him on the near north side of Chicago and

00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:44.549
he started one of these stories with me. It
was something that went on for sometime and

00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:48.769
I was of course wrapped and waiting for every
you know, the next word but Jo was waiting

00:28:48.769 --> 00:28:54.710
to go home. So this went on for some time
with her, you know, politely yanking at his

00:28:54.710 --> 00:29:02.899
sleeve and she finally just utterly frustrated
said, Hey, Mr. Vast Wasteland, I want to go

00:29:02.899 --> 00:29:07.919
home. [Laughter] Jonathan Zittrain: I got
to say though, among the compliments, to say

00:29:07.919 --> 00:29:11.399
that someone is a good man to sit shiva with,
that s a [Laughter] Jonathan Zittrain: That

00:29:11.399 --> 00:29:14.659
s a compliment. Ann Marie Lipinski: Jonathan
Zittrain: Those of you who don t know it,

00:29:14.659 --> 00:29:19.909
you can Google it. Yes. [Laughter] Ann Marie
Lipinski: But there is an important point

00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:25.299
which is I mean, you know, Newt said a lot
of important things tonight as he has been

00:29:25.299 --> 00:29:29.340
saying for years but one of them was, you
know, telling President Kennedy that sending

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:36.960
ideas into space was more important than sending
men into space and what you know, therein

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:42.739
lies this great notion of his which is the
technology is meaningless, right, without

00:29:42.739 --> 00:29:49.639
the content and his ability to really inspire
with language and the way these ideas are

00:29:49.639 --> 00:29:57.009
infused with this amazing poetry. Vast wasteland,
you know, was a term that sort of existed

00:29:57.009 --> 00:30:01.749
in one realm and that 50 years later, [0:30:00]
you know, after Gilligan s Island and Dark

00:30:01.749 --> 00:30:05.690
Shadows and all the things that, you know,
polluted my youth, that we re still talking

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:11.070
about that and still inspired by those ideas
and taking that and thinking about it in terms

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:15.880
of other media. I think it s really, really
provocative and something he didn t say is

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:20.669
that he s also I mean still all these years
later, working on new models of journalism.

00:30:20.669 --> 00:30:25.590
He is one of the founding board members of
the Chicago News Cooperative which was his

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:30.280
when I left the paper, you know, he called
me instantly not to say anything other than,

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:35.799
I have the next job for you, because he was
already imagining what came next for American

00:30:35.799 --> 00:30:41.639
journalism and it s just you know, his use
of really poetic language to elevate those

00:30:41.639 --> 00:30:46.090
ideas, I think, is something that has been
lost a lot when we talk about how provocative

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:50.549
that speech was and it s a great lesson for,
you know, journalists everywhere. Jonathan

00:30:50.549 --> 00:30:55.799
Zittrain: And one thing Newt has been known
to somewhat rue [0:30:54] [Phonetic] is that

00:30:55.799 --> 00:31:02.580
that evocative language is the bumper sticker
from the speech. Rather he has said then the

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:08.849
phrase public interest which is much less
evocative but perhaps Ann Marie Lipinski:

00:31:08.849 --> 00:31:11.999
Well, it you know, it s the tyranny of the
headline writer. It made it Jonathan Zittrain:

00:31:11.999 --> 00:31:14.679
Yes. Ann Marie Lipinski: I believe it was
the page one headline in the New York Times

00:31:14.679 --> 00:31:18.659
which is the next morning, which is why we
re all using it today; but actually there

00:31:18.659 --> 00:31:22.869
s something in that speech and I don t know
what he thinks. One of the most inspirational

00:31:22.869 --> 00:31:27.919
paragraphs to me is where he says he basically
looks at the room and he says, Is there a

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:35.759
man in this room who doesn t believe they
can do better? I mean to ask that of anybody

00:31:35.759 --> 00:31:42.269
and anything they do and to me, that s a powerful
moment and then I think sort of funny. He

00:31:42.269 --> 00:31:47.619
says next, Let me ask it another way. Is there
a broadcaster in this room who thinks that

00:31:47.619 --> 00:31:53.019
the broadcaster next to them can t do better?
But if you ask that about your work, any of

00:31:53.019 --> 00:31:58.379
us, can we not do better tomorrow? Who among
us would say we cannot? Jonathan Zittrain:

00:31:58.379 --> 00:32:01.330
Yes. Ann Marie Lipinski: And I actually I
mean that s the part of the speech that I

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:09.870
actually find the most demanding and the most
insistent that I ve recollected Jonathan Zittrain:

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:17.330
And finally in the year since for the public
interest piece of it, do you feel like there

00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:23.250
s a consensus around what that means when
it is and isn t being served, when you are

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:25.539
doing better and when you re not Ann Marie
Lipinski: Jonathan Zittrain: or is it a personal

00:32:25.539 --> 00:32:30.339
standard Ann Marie Lipinski: It would be interesting
to hear Newt or somebody talk about the extent

00:32:30.339 --> 00:32:35.989
to which there was agreement about what public
interest meant then. My sense is we know less

00:32:35.989 --> 00:32:40.179
what that means now, that there are fewer
and fewer people who would define that in

00:32:40.179 --> 00:32:50.179
the same way and I don t think it s a shared
ethos in the society. Jonathan Zittrain: Jonathan

00:32:50.179 --> 00:32:56.149
Alter, why don t we turn to you? There was
an invitation in Newt s remarks to think about

00:32:56.149 --> 00:33:02.919
politics and television and media. You wrote
The Promise: President Obama, Year One and

00:33:02.919 --> 00:33:08.179
I guess you followed the campaign through
thick and thin. That would be at least one

00:33:08.179 --> 00:33:11.979
angle to start with but if there s anything
else we don t know about you biographically,

00:33:11.979 --> 00:33:15.489
we won t lean on Wikipedia. We ll lean on
you. Feel free to tell us and then respond

00:33:15.489 --> 00:33:21.479
as you like. Jonathan Alter: Well, maybe the
most relevant is that I m from Chicago and

00:33:21.479 --> 00:33:29.529
I essentially grew up with the Minows in one
fashion or another so there s a bit of nepotism

00:33:29.529 --> 00:33:34.559
at work here today perhaps. Anybody who has
small children or nieces and nephews and wants

00:33:34.559 --> 00:33:41.799
a good book for them, I recommend Jo Minow
s books. They re also about my favorite vegetable,

00:33:41.799 --> 00:33:53.370
the artichoke so and so I have just left Newsweek
after 28 years there and I work now I write

00:33:53.370 --> 00:34:00.479
in addition to books, I m writing a column
for Bloomberg View which is a new commentary

00:34:00.479 --> 00:34:09.510
website that was just launched by Bloomberg;
and for, I guess, eight years or so in the

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:20.300
80s, I was Newsweek s media critic and I used
Newt Minow as a I think now he can tell now

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:29.270
it can be told, was an important source for
me is his many connections throughout the

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:38.861
media. A couple of things that he was too
modest to mention. The most important is that

00:34:38.861 --> 00:34:47.710
he is the father of the presidential debate
and the televised presidential debate. I think

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:53.530
casual students of history believe that Lincoln
was the first one to debate but those were

00:34:53.530 --> 00:35:00.200
in a senate campaign and what actually happened
was there were no radio debates [0:35:00]

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:11.020
in the 20th century between major party candidates.
In 1956, when Adlai Stevenson who was a very

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:17.221
close associate of Newt Minow was running
for president, the democratic nominee, and

00:35:17.221 --> 00:35:24.960
Newt was one of his two or three closest aids,
Newt sent him a memo saying there should be

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:34.780
debates, televised debates; and Stevenson,
you know, kind of shopped it around and nobody

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.080
was quite ready for it. But four years later,
1960, they picked up on Newt s idea and Kennedy

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:46.230
and Nixon had their historic debates then
they had a 16-year gap when there were no

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:54.790
presidential debates and they resumed again
in 1976. But they had not yet been institutionalized

00:35:54.790 --> 00:36:02.280
as a permanent part of our process and so
Newt chaired a commission on presidential

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:08.140
debates which he was kind enough to invite
me to participate in and we met here at Harvard

00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:15.400
people from the media broadcasting the political
parties and set up the structure that now

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:23.760
exists for the sponsorship of televised presidential
debates. I think we can say if it hadn t been

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:28.470
for his pushing for them, we would probably
not have that as part of our system right

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:35.710
now. The other thing, he mentioned his corporate
board memberships, which those of you who

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:42.730
will become corporate lawyers will no doubt
be members of corporate boards; but I think

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:53.970
that his career in total is emblematic of
something that George H.W Bush said once which

00:36:53.970 --> 00:37:03.550
is that no career is complete without service
to others and public service. If you, you

00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:09.620
know, come back here for your 50th law school
reunion and, you know, maybe the way people

00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:14.321
are living now, maybe you will be back for
your 75th law school reunion and you haven

00:37:14.321 --> 00:37:22.560
t been doing anything else other than representing
your clients and making some money and helping

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:28.970
your already wealthy clients get wealthier.
I m sorry to sound like an Old Testament figure

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:36.660
but you have failed. You just you can t go
through life and do that without some kind

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:42.190
of deep involvement in your community either
through serving in the government or being

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:46.760
heavily involved as Newt and Jo have been
in a wide variety of other things and I know

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:52.390
that most of you will do that. So I don t
mean to be so censorious about it but he hadn

00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:59.330
t mentioned these other things. Now just very
briefly in terms of the future which Newt

00:37:59.330 --> 00:38:05.660
challenged us to look to, to me, the central
problem right now in the news business and

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:16.490
thereby in politics by extension and communications
by extension and in our democracy is that

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:22.600
the business model of the news business, which
is the only business that is recognized by

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:32.920
the US constitution explicitly, the business
model is now dysfunctional; and the reason

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:37.360
that it s dysfunctional is not that there
aren t some people who are making money. It

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:51.290
s that talk is cheap and reporting is expensive
so the vast wasteland now has this big Tower

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:55.200
of Babel on top of it. All right? Jonathan
Zittrain: You really are going biblical on

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:58.980
us Jonathan Alter: s a mixed metaphor. I m
going biblical. I m going biblical big time.

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:04.550
So, you know, every time you turn on the TV,
it s not like when there was when Newt was

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:11.100
head of the FCC, 15 minutes of news a night.
It wasn t until 1963 that NBC and CBS went

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:18.320
to a half hour. There was no 60 minutes. You
basically couldn t find news. Now we re lousy

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:25.710
with news . But what kind of news is it? It
s people like me babbling on MSNBC or Fox

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:31.870
or CNN or wherever and that the reporting
which is what a demographic society needs,

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:37.790
the fresh information that it needs, is really
expensive. It costs the New York Times like

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:42.980
a million dollars a year to have a bureau
in Baghdad, to actually find out what s really

00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:48.620
going on and we ve developed and I hate to
sell like an old fogy on this but especially

00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:53.490
some of the young reporters that I see. They
ve developed the sense that they don t actually

00:39:53.490 --> 00:39:58.930
have to go somewhere or pick up the telephone
in order to report new information. That they

00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:05.430
can find it all [0:40:00] online and you can
find a lot online but there s an awful lot

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:12.261
that you can t find out unless you report
it. See it with your own eyes and ears. Call

00:40:12.261 --> 00:40:18.240
somebody up on a telephone and ask them questions
that they might not want to hear. Sometimes

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:23.240
they will respond by email but usually you
have to talk to them. So the question I have

00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:29.030
is, If talk is cheap and reporting is expensive,
how are we going to get not the information

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:37.040
that we need but the knowledge and quality
content to make rational decisions in a democratic

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:40.490
society? and I don t have an answer. Jonathan
Zittrain: Since you have just framed that

00:40:40.490 --> 00:40:46.270
question so well and we have special guests
whom we ll be calling upon as well, let s

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:52.950
just work it in right with the flow. Ethan
ve been looking at Ethan Zuckerman who originated

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:58.700
a venture called Global Voices, tagline The
world is talking. Are you listening? and I

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:04.440
m curious whether you see something like Global
Voices as fitting in the constitutional description

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:10.880
of the press that Jonathan was talking about
or is it the Tower of Babel about which he

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:15.670
has complained? Ethan Zuckerman: Well, I hope
that we re not contributing all that much

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:23.050
to the Tower of Babel although it s certainly
a possibility. Look, I actually largely agree

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:28.600
with Jonathan s points there. I think that
there s an enormous crisis going on in international

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:35.790
reporting and I think what s so ironic about
this is that we re at a moment where it should

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:43.070
be so much easier to report from around the
globe. There s this enormous amount of video

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:49.220
being filmed, being put online and it s not
all being put together by professional journalism.

00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:55.951
It s being put together by amateurs. Some
of it is being put together by bloggers. It

00:41:55.951 --> 00:42:01.740
needs a great deal of translation. It needs
a great deal of curation to be helpful and

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:06.980
I think what s really interesting is that
we re at a moment in time where one model

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:12.680
has sort of decayed. We haven t come up with
the next model. I m actually pretty optimistic

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:20.130
that the next model can come along and leverage
some of these opened networks that Newt Minow

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:23.510
has been involved with and that many of the
people in this room are deeply passionate

00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:29.980
about but I also think it happens automatically.
I think taking very seriously this notion

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:34.530
that we may find ourselves reduced to the
least common denominator with the news media,

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:40.030
which is frankly talking heads rather than
going through the very hard work of contextualizing

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:44.990
either original reporting from the ground
or citizen reporting from the ground; because

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:50.290
it s hard work no matter what you do with
any of that. But what I think was very interesting

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:56.470
is as you were reacting there, Dave Marash
who a long time broadcast journalist, fairly

00:42:56.470 --> 00:43:03.050
recently the US anchor for Al Jazeera, just
wrote a really remarkable piece in the Columbia

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:10.060
Journalism Review. One of the first things
he says in it is that we are seeing the emergence

00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:14.940
of a universal human language and that s video
and I think that s absolutely right. I think

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:21.460
getting to the point where individuals are
able to create and disseminate video at almost

00:43:21.460 --> 00:43:28.120
zero cost has just unprecedented power in
bridging between different corners of the

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:33.310
world. I think a lot of what happens in Tahrir
Square and people s ability to watch along

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:40.220
had to do with the power of the moving image
and I m struck by going back to Newt Minow

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:45.490
s speech and thinking about the notion that
television at its best really is better than

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:52.140
almost any other medium we have. Video really
is phenomenally and strongly powerful but

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:58.220
it needs some help and it needs translation
and it needs curation and it needs contextualization;

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:03.320
and trying to figure out how we do that in
the context of a new media environment is

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:07.970
one of the giant challenges that organizations
like mine have and frankly the news media

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:09.640
as a whole Jonathan Alter: Can I just respond
very quickly? Ethan Zuckerman: [0:44:09] [Inaudible]

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:14.260
Jonathan Alter: I think that you re spot on
with that and it is very exciting what social

00:44:14.260 --> 00:44:22.360
media is doing and citizen journalism around
the world may be the most exciting thing in

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:29.330
global politics. But one of the things that
s missing is not just the context that editing

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:36.400
brings that you mentioned but also the connective
tissue between the images that we see and

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:42.980
that move us and political and social change.
So there was that image in Iran for instance

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:49.050
in 2009 of the woman dying in the streets
that went everywhere in the world and really

00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:52.940
grabbed people s attention in an important
way and was an example of the international

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:58.041
language that you re talking about but it
didn t lead to any change in Iran. It did

00:44:58.041 --> 00:45:05.830
in Egypt in maybe an [0:45:00] attenuated
way but investigative reporting which if somebody

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:10.110
was on the front page of the New York Times
just to give you a recent example. There was

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:16.160
a great story about how there are chemotherapy
drugs that there are shortages of them and

00:45:16.160 --> 00:45:21.570
so it used to be that a story like that would
appear and then very quickly, the action to

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:29.670
address what the story raised. That s just
not happening as much now and we re not seeing

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:38.030
as many positive outcomes from good journalistic
work, social outcome. Jonathan Zittrain: I

00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:41.800
guess when everything is a crisis every hour
Jonathan Alter: Yes. Jonathan Zittrain: your

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.650
outraged reservoir is totally drained. Jonathan
Alter: That s part of it. Jonathan Zittrain:

00:45:44.650 --> 00:45:47.060
And then you re just like Jonathan Alter:
Yes. Jonathan Zittrain: yes, I knew it. No

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:49.750
chemotherapy drugs. Jonathan Alter: Right.
Jonathan Zittrain: Of course that s the state

00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:55.560
of the world. Jonathan Alter: Right. Jonathan
Zittrain: Right, that kind of thing. Yochai,

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:59.680
I think it might make sense to turn next to
you because you ve been thinking hard both

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:05.000
about the structure of networks, the pipes,
how to grant equal access to them; and of

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.640
course the end for which that is a means is
to give voices to lots of people that might

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:16.820
not otherwise have them and to append the
industrial information economy that I think

00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:21.890
may be what Jonathan was thinking of when
he was thinking about some of the traditional

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:27.661
press in its profession. So I m curious with
your take on this. Yochai Benkler: So, just

00:46:27.661 --> 00:46:33.320
to start, it s a real pleasure and honor to
be able to have this conversation and have

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:40.300
this conversation with you. It s rare that
you have an instance that so captures an entire

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:45.950
era of policy and regulation and that everybody
can anchor themselves and say this is what

00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:54.471
we re talking about, one generation after
another. But actually related to that, I want

00:46:54.471 --> 00:47:00.810
to pick a different less poetic piece from
that speech that I think captures and hasn

00:47:00.810 --> 00:47:07.410
t quite been raised yet but is really responsive
to your point, Jonathan, about it takes money

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:13.760
too and it goes roughly like this. This is
again a quote from the Vast Wasteland Speech.

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:19.290
Tell your sponsors to be less concerned with
cost per thousands and more concerned with

00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:24.150
understanding per millions and remind your
stockholders that investment in broadcasting

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:28.900
is buying a share in public responsibility.
The networks can start this industry on the

00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:39.350
road to freedom from the dictatorship of numbers.
That core tension between the American broadcast

00:47:39.350 --> 00:47:44.960
model and the American media model that is
fundamentally anchored in [0:47:43] [Indiscernible]

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:50.270
and the American belief that this is supposed
to serve as the network for the state has

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:57.000
been there. It has been there from journalism
before television. It has been there, here.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:05.980
That tension is what makes the possibility
of a public response. I mean the founding

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:13.680
public television, the idea that you can actually
have public funding but also non-profit funding

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:25.400
as a core of the way in which we produce news
is really quite alien to Americans, I think.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:29.990
We have public television but at the same
time, people will say, Well, if there s government

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:35.800
funding, there will be too much influence,
ignoring the fact that the BBC presents the

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:41.180
best breed of news reporting in television
and nonetheless it s publicly-funded. There

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:46.330
are such models. They re just intention with
the way we do things here. I think one of

00:48:46.330 --> 00:48:52.880
the things that the net enables, and I think
Ethan was pushing in that direction and you

00:48:52.880 --> 00:49:01.681
came back with a no but you still need something
that costs a lot of money, is that the model

00:49:01.681 --> 00:49:08.260
of production for the first time allows for
radically-distributed production, right? There

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:14.820
s a reason that the video you saw of Neda
Agha Soltan from Iran was a video from someone

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:18.270
on the street. The newspapers couldn t get
there. Jonathan Alter: Right. Yochai Benkler:

00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:21.990
They were excluded. The fact that a hundred
thousand besiege were able to beat down a

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:25.960
revolution doesn t mean that the reporting
wasn t critical. Otherwise, we wouldn t know

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:29.910
about it and it turned out to inspire enough
that it did matter in Tahrir. It did matter

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:35.750
in Tunis. Last week in the iLaw seminar we
had here for a week, Ethan was sitting there

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:43.570
telling the story of what happened before
Egypt in Tunisia and how much of what you

00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:49.240
have is this complex interaction between on
one hand people on the ground. On the other

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:53.670
hand, people who are on the diaspora again
on a non-profit political basis building what

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:59.260
they build and talking with each other and
then ultimately going to Al Jazeera, a publicly-funded

00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:07.750
[0:50:00] source to generalize. So, I think
what s critical is to see that for the first

00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:14.930
time, because of the fact that we all hold
in our hands image capture equipment, sound

00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:19.730
recording equipment, writing equipment, distribution
on generally available platforms that are

00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:24.350
consumer-grade platforms like YouTube as opposed
to a satellite link that needs to cost who

00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:32.180
knows how much, we actually have the opportunity
to solve this tear between what requires a

00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:38.130
lot of money and what we need as citizens.
That s not dependent on something that is

00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:43.740
so difficult for the American political system
and American cultural system to swallow which

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:49.650
is public funding, at least not public funding
at a level that is really solve the whole

00:50:49.650 --> 00:50:54.050
problem. Jonathan Alter: Right, and I just
very briefly, I think that s exactly right

00:50:54.050 --> 00:51:03.000
and that s why I m also optimistic generally
because of what you just said; but it depends

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:13.400
on a new marketplace and ideas and it depends
on that marketplace working. So that the quality,

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:17.740
you know, tweets so there s some relationship
between how many followers you have and how

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:23.730
good your tweets are or some relationship
between how many people are reading your blog

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:32.910
and how good your blog is and I do think that
is starting to happen in particular subsets

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:42.440
of media and that s a very positive development
but it does depend on quality it depends on

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:47.840
a model where quality brings enough eyeballs
that it can be Jonathan Zittrain: It sounds

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:51.770
like you re saying there s a clear market
for paparazzi, like that s not a Jonathan

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:53.550
Alter: Right. TMZ Jonathan Zittrain: business
model that s in trouble. Jonathan Alter: s

00:51:53.550 --> 00:51:57.500
not in trouble. Jonathan Zittrain: But it
s not clear that the market for revelations

00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:01.860
about chemotherapy drugs is still sustainable.
Jonathan Alter: Well, it might be because

00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:06.720
you might be able to get the chemotherapy
drug companies advertising on that site, you

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:09.160
know. So there are Jonathan Zittrain: Not
enough drugs Jonathan Alter: a lot of yes.

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:12.050
Jonathan Zittrain: Right. Jonathan Alter:
There are a lot of other, you know, creative

00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:15.180
possibilities Jonathan Zittrain: Yes. Jonathan
Alter: for underwriting that Jonathan Zittrain:

00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:20.080
Yes. Jonathan Alter: kind of coverage but
then you have questions that needs to be independent

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:22.710
of the advertising. Jonathan Zittrain: Yes.
Jonathan Alter: And those are very old questions

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:24.020
Jonathan Zittrain: Yes. Jonathan Alter: in
our business. Jonathan Zittrain: Independence

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:26.160
from Yochai Benkler: Jonathan Zittrain: Sorry.
Go ahead. Yochai Benkler: I would resist the

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:31.950
notion that the sine qua non of quality is
many eyeballs that can sell a lot, right?

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:35.710
It s the interface between Jonathan Alter:
Right. Yochai Benkler: very different systems,

00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:39.180
right? So we have you know, if you want to
look at media [0:52:38] [Indiscernible], you

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:43.410
have things like Media Matters and FactCheck.org
that are Jonathan Alter: Right. Yochai Benkler:

00:52:43.410 --> 00:52:49.730
public interest, located in universities based
on the modeling which we produce all sorts

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:53.950
of scholarship, all sorts of public goods
that are public interest. Alongside something

00:52:53.950 --> 00:52:59.860
that is non-profit like ProPublica alongside
the New York Times and so the mix between

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:06.510
them. So I saw the story on Zanzibar on Global
Voices before I saw it here and there was

00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:11.183
context from somebody who was over there and
actually writing. That s because there s someone

00:53:11.183 --> 00:53:17.230
there who cares about it. I think the reemergence
of the party presses both left and right in

00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:20.790
the blogosphere tells you that there are people
who are going to be out there and trying to

00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:24.230
ferret all sorts of things. Jonathan Alter:
Is that a good thing to go to a European or

00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:28.950
19th century model of party press? That Yochai
Benkler: If people would care about enough

00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:32.440
to go and look for political information,
teach themselves, teach each other, absolutely

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:36.410
it s a good thing. If people come together
to speak together, absolutely it s a good

00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:39.200
thing. [Crosstalk] [0:53:37] Ann Marie Lipinski:
Well, I was just going to say the one thing

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:45.030
I mean Jonathan raised it but that we re missing
and we re referencing market. But I mean how

00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:50.960
many people in this room would have paid money
individually for that photograph? How many

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:58.310
people in this room would pay you know, would
start paying to follow somebody on Twitter?

00:53:58.310 --> 00:54:06.250
So this notion that you know, and I know this
is a much misquoted quote that has hung out

00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:11.400
there for years. That information wants to
be free. It may want to be free but journalism

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:17.130
is unbelievably expensive. I mean one of our
fellows this year covers Afghanistan for the

00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:21.380
New York Times and she s one of, you know,
many people who the Times has there and we

00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:28.240
talked about what it takes just to cover that
war for a single newspaper and but that s

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:33.600
the New York Times. I mean they ve got, you
know, a very specific kind of model. It s

00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:38.530
under unbelievable stress. They have fewer
people today doing that than they did, you

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:46.500
know, a year ago and certainly then 10 years
ago. But who you know, think about your own

00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:51.280
news and information consumption habits and
think about how much of it you actually pay

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.070
for. Jonathan Zittrain: And for which Ann
Marie Lipinski: And Jonathan Zittrain: Yochai

00:54:54.070 --> 00:54:57.680
is saying perhaps the government should pay
for it. Ann Marie Lipinski: And I just want

00:54:57.680 --> 00:54:59.670
and so this is a [0:54:58] [Indiscernible].
I mean Jonathan Zittrain: Yes. Ann Marie Lipinski:

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:03.800
not to but [0:55:00] so you know, you went
to Wikipedia. It told you I was the curator-designate.

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:10.470
Small thing but amplify that kind of error
many times, you know, across the sort of,

00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:16.360
you know, information sphere where you re
consuming things; and this idea that there

00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:24.130
are people who don t just gather but who vet
and vet and vet. That there s a difference

00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:31.690
between that kind of information and things
that are just sort of gathered and exposed

00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:36.880
and what it takes to finance those kinds of
efforts and what we re all willing to pay

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:43.270
for that. There is a huge disconnect Jonathan
Zittrain: Yochai Benkler: Can we agree that

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:50.010
for every one mistake in Wikipedia, we have
Judith Miller on Iraq and that that outweighs

00:55:50.010 --> 00:55:54.670
many Jonathan Zittrain: My guess is that is
not going to be a Ann Marie Lipinski: Yes.

00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:58.340
Jonathan Zittrain: quick agreement. [Laughter]
Jonathan Zittrain: But of course you are looking

00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:02.070
for agreement necessarily with that question.
Yochai Benkler: Me? Looking for controversy?

00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:05.651
Jonathan Zittrain: But Newt, you want to get
in, so please. Newt Minow: I think you can

00:56:05.651 --> 00:56:12.960
learn a lot from other countries and other
cultures. I got very interested in this when

00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:19.970
I was at the FCC and I visited Japan. I learned
about the Japanese system and I asked them

00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:26.780
why they had that system. They said when television
began, the Japanese sent teams all throughout

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:36.140
the world to figure out which was the best
system and they loved the BBC. So they started

00:56:36.140 --> 00:56:43.520
with what was called NHK which is the equivalent
of the BBC in Japan. They wanted to find a

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:51.270
way to use money from everybody but yet, that
it would create an institution that was independent

00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:58.420
of the government. It s a real trick. How
do you take money from everyone and yet have

00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:01.610
an institution that can criticize being a
[0:57:00] [Indiscernible] of the government.

00:57:01.610 --> 00:57:08.180
Well, the Brits did it with a license fee.
Everyone in England must pay if they want

00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:15.020
a television set, they must pay X dollars
a year for a license to have a television

00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:23.100
set. That money goes into a fund that creates
the BBC. The Japanese have exactly the same

00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:29.670
system. In our country, we didn t do that.
We started in so those were the first systems.

00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:37.869
BBC started before commercial broadcasting.
NHK started before commercial broadcasting.

00:57:37.869 --> 00:57:45.060
We started with commercial broadcasting. We
added, as a footnote, public broadcasting

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:51.730
later without a means to pay it. The Carnegie
Commission, when it created public television,

00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:58.840
said everyone who buys a television set should
pay a $5 fee that goes into a fund for public

00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:06.480
television. The Vietnam War was on. President
Johnson didn t want to have a new $5 fee forever

00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:13.650
so it was dropped. So the result is we have
a poorly-financed system. The question really

00:58:13.650 --> 00:58:19.840
to me, the big question is, Do you want the
market to decide everything? Do you think

00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:26.460
the market can provide everything or are there
certain things the market will not provide

00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:32.760
and if there are, can they be provided by
some alternative system? That we never settled

00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:36.070
that in the Jonathan Zittrain: And I guess
the beauty of the license is that it sort

00:58:36.070 --> 00:58:38.685
of goes into a lock box. It s not like the
government Newt Minow: Right. Jonathan Zittrain:

00:58:38.685 --> 00:58:43.250
changes the appropriation. It s that this
is specifically to support that enterprise.

00:58:43.250 --> 00:58:46.220
Newt Minow: Correct, and the BBC Jonathan
Zittrain: Yes. Newt Minow: is often in an

00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:53.330
argument with the government on this issue
or that issue and so there is a tension there

00:58:53.330 --> 00:58:57.030
but it s a device we never even thought of
in our country. Jonathan Zittrain: I guess

00:58:57.030 --> 00:59:01.900
today it would have to be flat screen monitors
or internet access or something. Jonathan

00:59:01.900 --> 00:59:09.090
Alter: I just I don t mean to like be the
skunk at the garden party but it isn t happening

00:59:09.090 --> 00:59:13.560
anytime soon. Newt Minow: re right. Jonathan
Alter: I mean there s one political party

00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:18.700
that their top priority early this year was
getting rid of NPR funding which is a very

00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:22.320
small percentage of NPR is Jonathan Zittrain:
Well, it s funny that that hoax email that

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:26.460
has been going around for about a decade,
about they re about to cut PBS, then became

00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:28.850
true. Jonathan Alter: Yes. Jonathan Zittrain:
Yes. Jonathan Alter: Yes, and I think a lot

00:59:28.850 --> 00:59:35.540
of it will be what you know, Ann Marie is
working on, you know, the non-profit model.

00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:41.050
ProPublica is doing some great work in investigative
reporting and a lot of it will be in niche

00:59:41.050 --> 00:59:48.730
programming that can make money. Like Fareed
Zakaria has a show on CNN. It s very substantive,

00:59:48.730 --> 00:59:53.470
international news and he gets sponsors and
he does well and then make even makes a little

00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:59.400
bit of money for CNN. So, you know, there
are ways of working within the four-profit

00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:03.030
model and [01:00:00] still do some quality
work. One of the things that s fascinating

01:00:03.030 --> 01:00:10.030
to me about was what looks like is about to
be happening is that we you know, even there

01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:17.190
s a story in the New York Times yesterday
that the late night scene is breaking apart

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:23.870
and that the Leno-Letterman model is now old
and shows like [01:00:22] [Indiscernible]

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:28.980
or The Cold Bear Report [Phonetic] which are
much cheaper to produce are kind of the future

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:34.970
that it s all getting vulcanized with smaller
considerably smaller audiences but making

01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:42.140
money with smaller audiences and your so to
your choice point and you know, there s now

01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:48.070
much more choice which is a hugely positive
development. But what worries me about it,

01:00:48.070 --> 01:00:53.320
because I always have to look for the dark
cloud, you know, is that I think remember

01:00:53.320 --> 01:00:58.180
how everybody used to talk about the digital
divide, you know, and you still hear it a

01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:07.190
lot. I think we might be headed for this is
clunky but a kind of a contextual divide between

01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:17.030
the Americans who get the vast wasteland stuff,
you know, no context. Maybe they re getting

01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:21.480
something in social media. You know, they
re seeing a snippet, a video from around the

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:28.720
world but they re not really getting context
and then elites who have a pretty great choice

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:34.840
of different websites to go to and so, you
know, I m always m very conscious of the fact

01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:41.340
that the entire political conversation goes
on among about 10 million people. The total

01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:47.630
ratings of the cable networks and the Sunday
shows, you know, in the New York Times and

01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:53.340
everybody gets into 10 to 15 million people.
Everybody you know, everybody you talked to.

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:58.540
A hundred and thirty million people vote in
presidential elections, you know. So where

01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:03.890
are that other 115, 120 Jonathan Zittrain:
Jonathan Alter: Where are they getting their

01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:05.869
information? Jonathan Zittrain: So this Jonathan
Alter: How are they making their decisions?

01:02:05.869 --> 01:02:10.210
Jonathan Zittrain: This raises great questions
for which I want to turn to more of our special

01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:14.800
guests for insight and on what you ve just
been talking about, Jonathan, I think Ellen

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:20.780
Goodman and Virginia Heffernan might be best
able to weigh in. Ellen, you ve been thinking

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:27.520
a lot about public interest, public information,
funding models, all along that stuff. Feel

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.693
Ellen Goodman: And the fact that people don
t want to eat their broccoli. Jonathan Zittrain:

01:02:30.693 --> 01:02:33.710
And the fact that people don t want to eat
their broccoli but they still might vote.

01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:40.100
So one strategy would be to stop them from
voting but another would be to have them vote

01:02:40.100 --> 01:02:44.000
and then that s the end of it and the third
would be to somehow get some broccoli into

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:49.210
the mix. So we have [01:02:45] [Indiscernible]
mics you should be free to use and the representative

01:02:49.210 --> 01:02:54.990
of good eating, please tell us what you think.
Ellen Goodman: OK. Well, I wanted to come

01:02:54.990 --> 01:03:00.890
back to the point about public media because
public media has sort of been looked to as

01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:05.619
the salvation both to produce the broccoli
and also to get people to eat it, somehow

01:03:05.619 --> 01:03:13.710
to become more popular than it is; and one
of the things that strikes me is Chairman

01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:19.750
Minow said the public broadcasting system
that we have in the US is weak and it was

01:03:19.750 --> 01:03:26.190
intentionally designed to be weak. Yet, it
seems to be these weak institutions that we

01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:31.480
look to, to sort of solve these market failures
whether it s a problem of curation or a problem

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:38.730
of reporting. So I wanted to pose the question.
So for all the proposals that are unrealistic

01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:45.840
but still worth making, as Yochai points out
to invest more public support and the broccoli

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:54.570
producers and broccoli marketers, are these
the right institutions? Can they be reformed

01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:56.680
existing public broadcasting institutions
Jonathan Zittrain: You sound skeptical. Ellen

01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:01.800
Goodman: that we have? Yes, I am skeptical
although I m a strong supporter of public

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:09.090
media. I don t think that the existing arrangement
that we have, not CPP, not PBS and not NPR

01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:14.560
as the strongest public media institutions
are capable of innovating like many large

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:21.980
innovations, they sorry, large institutions.
They are not innovators and it although it

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:26.780
s reasonable to look to these non-market actors
to solve these problems, I don t think these

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:33.270
are going to be the actors. Jonathan Zittrain:
Virginia Heffernan, you ve seen the landscape

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:38.650
both as a student of television. You ve forced
yourself to watch a lot of it and write about

01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:43.180
it in the New York Times or elsewhere. Virginia
Heffernan: No forcing. I m a doughnut eater

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.040
Jonathan Zittrain: Oh, you re a doughnut eater.
You don t eat the broccoli? Virginia Heffernan:

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:52.720
And I really believe that beta carotene and
foliate is where you find it in the media.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:05:00.150
I something on this so, one of the things
that Mr. Minow ve bored him with before [01:05:00]

01:05:00.150 --> 01:05:07.910
is the idea that something in this vast wasteland
had an amazingly salubrious effect for entertainment.

01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:13.720
We ve been talking mostly about news but television
and entertainment is hugely improved and if

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:21.960
you look at HBO or even Bravo, you see anything
but a vast wasteland now. So, some credit

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:28.940
goes to the you know, the part of the speech
where Mr. Minow says he imagines a time when

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:34.270
all the forces of art, creativity, daring
and imagination had been unleashed. He s not

01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:38.500
talking strictly about the public interest
and everybody getting spinach and broccoli.

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:42.680
He s talking about an artistic explosion that
we have actually seen in television in the

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:50.660
last 50. So it s worth giving the communications
technology and the free market a little bit

01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:56.500
of credit for that and I know he s a big fan
of Mad Men as I am and probably many of you

01:05:56.500 --> 01:06:01.600
are here, which I think wouldn t have been
possible without an environment in which television

01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:05.660
is regarded both as an art form and as a public
health hazard. It Jonathan Zittrain: s weird

01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:09.810
that it s a television show about a time when
television was terrible. Virginia Heffernan:

01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:19.530
And part of the virtue of it is that tension.
So the entertainment side though is not the

01:06:19.530 --> 01:06:27.200
doughnut side is not an afterthought. Mr.
Minow also mentioned that after 9/11, there

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:33.740
was no YouTube and that s strictly speaking
true although pretty soon after 9/11, a movie

01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:39.560
called Loose Change, that alleged that 9/11
was an inside job brought about by some Jewish

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:45.480
Americans to attack the country and inflame
the CIA or something like that, appeared and

01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:52.780
you could watch it on the internet and I watched
it there. Some of us who really liked online

01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:59.900
video from the beginning also like to look
at a sordid site called Ogrish that had where

01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:07.500
you could see terrorist videos and you could
see ultimately you could see hanging videos

01:07:07.500 --> 01:07:12.860
and that s where the Saddam Hussein execution
video washed up after his execution. David

01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:20.280
Pogue and I found that video online just as
the New York Times was reporting in Iraq the

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:26.910
way that execution went down. They were interviewing
people outside the hanging room to get details

01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:32.800
exactly on what happened and as it happened,
they were misinformed. Our million dollar

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:38.480
bad guy bureau couldn all that money couldn
t tell the story of what happened in that

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:44.770
room where the video told it loud and clear.
Someone in the room had a video camera and

01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:49.369
those of us who were undaunted like to look
and liked, for whatever perverse reason, to

01:07:49.369 --> 01:07:56.520
look at videos on LiveLeak made by soldiers
and other military personnel. Looked at those

01:07:56.520 --> 01:08:01.620
videos and could understand the very night
of the execution, what Saddam Hussein s last

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:06.420
words were where the New York Times reported
them and other places reported them wrong

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:12.360
on the front page. But and I m reading Errol
Morris book right now, Believing is Seeing.

01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:18.839
It s a completely fascinating book about some
of the images of the past 10 years since 9/11

01:08:18.839 --> 01:08:27.109
and it makes the case more than ever, especially
about the Abu Ghraib images, that contextualization

01:08:27.109 --> 01:08:32.599
and criticism and obviously, you know, we
all write from where we sit. A critic is an

01:08:32.599 --> 01:08:36.369
extremely important part of this and while
I believe the New York Times has made a great

01:08:36.369 --> 01:08:41.609
investment in its international reporting
and that has been the best thing it s done

01:08:41.609 --> 01:08:47.639
to show up the brand and also inform the readers,
we also need people to put that new video

01:08:47.639 --> 01:08:53.710
lingua franca into context. It s an extremely
difficult language to speak. When you look

01:08:53.710 --> 01:09:00.309
at the Abu Ghraib images, are they entertainment?
Are they documentation? Morris does a really

01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:04.429
brilliant job trying to tease that apart but
I wouldn t want to be Bill Keller trying to

01:09:04.429 --> 01:09:10.829
figure that out the night those images surfaced
and the fact that some many of those images

01:09:10.829 --> 01:09:15.679
including some of the images from Iran walked
the line between news and entertainment. It

01:09:15.679 --> 01:09:22.799
means that we also need to have our entertainment
caps on. It wasn t a new source that published

01:09:22.799 --> 01:09:30.249
that first published the images of the Saddam
Hussein execution. It was a source that well,

01:09:30.249 --> 01:09:34.759
I saw it on LiveLeak where you mostly see
escape or car crashes and medical anomalies

01:09:34.759 --> 01:09:38.390
and things that teenage boys like to look
at. That s the place that an execution video

01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:43.559
turned up. It didn t turn up on PBS. It didn
t even turn up in the New York Times. So I

01:09:43.559 --> 01:09:49.929
think we need to be looking at the entertainment
channels. I think entertainment was vitalized

01:09:49.929 --> 01:09:55.239
by the Vast Wasteland Speech and we should
be looking at that part of the television,

01:09:55.239 --> 01:10:02.719
you know, and also news programming that walks
the line like the [01:10:00] magazine shows

01:10:02.719 --> 01:10:07.299
to as a you know, as a source that could be
in the public interest. Jonathan Zittrain:

01:10:07.299 --> 01:10:11.130
So this was such a textured and kaleidoscopic
comment. Virginia Heffernan: Sorry. Jonathan

01:10:11.130 --> 01:10:13.900
Zittrain: No, totally informative. Virginia
Heffernan: That s because I m exploding. Jonathan

01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:19.479
Zittrain: That s amazing. I m just trying
to figure out whether to come out of it happy

01:10:19.479 --> 01:10:25.519
or sad. So just maybe one quick follow-up
is do you suppose, right you ve written a

01:10:25.519 --> 01:10:30.080
book Magic and Loss: The Pleasures of the
Internet. You re bridging television to internet

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:36.880
and that s just you do in your comment. Is
it the sort of thing for which this ecosystem

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:45.719
is in need of the kind of shaking by the lapels
that Newt Minow did to the television industry

01:10:45.719 --> 01:10:53.369
in 1961 or is it that it s going to shake
out and that there s no real grasp for lapels

01:10:53.369 --> 01:10:59.639
here Virginia Heffernan: I would love to see
a Vast Wasteland Speech in that moral, poetic

01:10:59.639 --> 01:11:04.420
key. I mean the only thing I can imagine right
now and really, I ve been asking everyone

01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:08.280
to do this in the question of, Can we do better?
Every single one of you should be registered

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:13.960
as a Wikipedia editor today. So if you haven
t done that, go home tonight. Doris Kearns

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:16.954
Goodwin, if you are not Female Participant:
Twice Virginia Heffernan: Yes. Female Participant:

01:11:16.954 --> 01:11:18.559
Twice if you re a woman. Virginia Heffernan:
Twice if you re a woman, exactly. Sign up

01:11:18.559 --> 01:11:23.119
your [Crosstalk] [01:11:19] Jonathan Zittrain:
Doris Kearns Goodwin edits the article on

01:11:23.119 --> 01:11:24.309
like Abraham Lincoln or Virginia Heffernan:
Jonathan Zittrain: something and then Hotpants15

01:11:24.309 --> 01:11:25.510
reversed it [Laughter] Virginia Heffernan:
Yes, exactly, exactly but if you I mean, are

01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:33.400
you? Are you? Doris Kearns Goodwin: Virginia
Heffernan: Doris Kearns Goodwin: Even though

01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:38.570
I could have been Virginia Heffernan: I mean
this is fascinating. This is the internet

01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:42.969
taxes us enormously but this is one way where
we are represented on the internet and the

01:11:42.969 --> 01:11:46.610
Wikipedia is the first thing that comes up
when you put in your name Abraham Lincoln

01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:55.610
s name into Google and it s edited by might
be edited by Hotpants15 and that I mean, I

01:11:55.610 --> 01:12:04.210
can t put it in Minowvian rhetoric but if
I could beseech you to do better, I would

01:12:04.210 --> 01:12:08.079
say register as an editor tonight. It s very
simple and Jonathan could talk you through

01:12:08.079 --> 01:12:12.099
it. Jonathan Zittrain: Yes. Ellen wants to
get back in but Doris, first, we just have

01:12:12.099 --> 01:12:14.088
to ask you. Is there any chance you would
do this? Doris Kearns Goodwin: m really moved

01:12:14.088 --> 01:12:15.088
by this. I Virginia Heffernan: Good. Doris
Kearns Goodwin: [01:12:19] [Inaudible] Jonathan

01:12:15.088 --> 01:12:17.280
Zittrain: No, no, no. I was going to make
it myself [Laughter] Jonathan Zittrain: [01:12:23]

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:22.599
[Inaudible] on behalf of Wikipedia. [Laughter]
Jonathan Zittrain: We welcome you aboard.

01:12:22.599 --> 01:12:32.760
Now it can be told that I am Hotpants15. [Laughter]
Jonathan Zittrain: But I [Crosstalk] [01:12:35]

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:38.679
Jonathan Zittrain: I just want it to be on
the record. Doris Kearns Goodwin: I understand.

01:12:38.679 --> 01:12:42.190
Jonathan Zittrain: That Doris Kearns Goodwin
is intrigued and elated to become a Wikipedia

01:12:42.190 --> 01:12:45.340
editor. Doris Kearns Goodwin: It is a deal
but if I may add something. Jonathan Zittrain:

01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:49.550
Yes. Doris Kearns Goodwin: It comes to what
Jonathan was saying about the Tower of Babel.

01:12:49.550 --> 01:12:55.139
What makes me sad when I think about the fact
that in history, communication media was so

01:12:55.139 --> 01:12:59.599
important for presidential leadership in so
many ways. I mean I m now living with the

01:12:59.599 --> 01:13:04.579
muckraking journalist and Teddy Roosevelt
and there you have magazines who put enormous

01:13:04.579 --> 01:13:09.679
money into reporting. Two years, three years,
Ida Tarbell could go reporting about Standard

01:13:09.679 --> 01:13:15.139
Oil, Ray Baker about the railroad abuses and
then those reports so mobilized the middle

01:13:15.139 --> 01:13:19.510
class that Teddy Roosevelt was able to get
legislation through a conservative congress

01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:23.739
because the public pushed the congress. When
FDR comes along with the radio, he s able

01:13:23.739 --> 01:13:28.369
to go over the head of the conservative press
who would never have given his message to

01:13:28.369 --> 01:13:33.639
the country because of the new radio and because
he had 30 fireside chats and Saul Bellow said

01:13:33.639 --> 01:13:38.280
you could walk down a hot Chicago street and
not miss a word of what he was saying because

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.489
everybody had it on. Eighty percent of the
adult radio audience was listening. When JFK

01:13:42.489 --> 01:13:47.889
gives his Cuban Missile Crisis Speech, they
immediately after he gives it, there s no

01:13:47.889 --> 01:13:51.570
[01:13:47] [Indiscernible], no Tower of Babel.
They cut back to regular programming so the

01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:56.159
country could absorb that speech and you wonder
now and we keep asking, What has happened

01:13:56.159 --> 01:14:01.550
to Obama s communication skills from the campaign
to the presidency? I think the bully pulpit

01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:05.949
has lost its bulliness. I mean he gives a
speech as he did on healthcare. Joe Wilson

01:14:05.949 --> 01:14:11.090
says, You lie, and then for days we talk about
You lie and not about the speech. I don t

01:14:11.090 --> 01:14:16.749
know what we do about the fact that if we
need the public to push the country to social

01:14:16.749 --> 01:14:22.030
and political change and leadership doesn
t have the relationship that it once had with

01:14:22.030 --> 01:14:26.840
the media to get that country mobilized. That
was the promise presumably of Obama that when

01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:31.260
he came in, we were going to have a new progressive
era and I think the whole media thing has

01:14:31.260 --> 01:14:35.640
made that difficult and that s where I think
your Tower of Babel is. Absolutely right on

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:40.400
and it just makes me sad because as I look
at history, I just I always want to be optimistic

01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.499
about it. Jonathan Zittrain: Yes, yes. Doris
Kearns Goodwin: And I m not sure how that

01:14:42.499 --> 01:14:43.780
partnership Jonathan Zittrain: Yes. Doris
Kearns Goodwin: is going to work Jonathan

01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:48.710
Zittrain: s a real emerging theme here. The
presidents have an astounding amount of diversity

01:14:48.710 --> 01:14:52.699
and additional channels for expression and
ways that entertainment can become news and

01:14:52.699 --> 01:14:58.139
vice versa; but at the same time, it raises
this Tower of Babel issue where none of us

01:14:58.139 --> 01:15:00.489
know how to turn Ann Marie Lipinski: Can I
bring a source [01:14:59] [Phonetic]? Jonathan

01:15:00.489 --> 01:15:03.560
Zittrain: Yes. Ann Marie Lipinski: [01:15:00]
have you seen exceptions to that? Doris Kearns

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:07.699
Goodwin: You mean in the current day? Ann
Marie Lipinski: The last handful of years.

01:15:07.699 --> 01:15:11.789
I mean sort of at what point do we fall off?
At what point does the bully pulpit start

01:15:11.789 --> 01:15:16.559
to disintegrate? Doris Kearns Goodwin: m not
sure I really know. I mean I just think that

01:15:16.559 --> 01:15:22.090
what it means is in a certain sense that no
leader is I mean there have been moments,

01:15:22.090 --> 01:15:26.710
I suppose, when m not sure. No, I m not sure.
Jonathan Zittrain: Maybe 9/11. Doris Kearns

01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:32.079
Goodwin: 9/11 was a moment that was a lost
opportunity. I mean there was a moment when

01:15:32.079 --> 01:15:36.260
the country was unified, would have been doing
anything if it had been asked for shared sacrifice,

01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:39.820
who could have been mobilized to a Manhattan
project for alternative energy. It could have

01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:43.219
been mobilized for more people to join the
army that never were asked to join so the

01:15:43.219 --> 01:15:47.869
same kids have to do it over and over again.
So there was a chance. Bush had a moment there

01:15:47.869 --> 01:15:51.719
of leadership where the media would have responded,
I think; but then once that dissipated, I

01:15:51.719 --> 01:15:56.849
haven t seen it since then really. Jonathan
Zittrain: Ellen, you wanted to get Ellen Goodman:

01:15:56.849 --> 01:16:01.460
Yes, I was stimulated by your comment about
shaking the lapels of the internet and, you

01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:05.579
know, the Vast Wasteland Speech, you could
shake the lapels of an industry because there

01:16:05.579 --> 01:16:11.070
were only a couple of institutions. This again
gets to this sense that we re in a post-institutional

01:16:11.070 --> 01:16:16.739
era. The presidency the institution of the
presidency has lost some of its power. I think

01:16:16.739 --> 01:16:23.619
all institutions have and I think for policy-making
and media, and as I said, I think public broadcasting

01:16:23.619 --> 01:16:27.659
institutions have not been designed to do
what we want them to do. We have to start

01:16:27.659 --> 01:16:33.530
thinking about the relationship between policy-making
and institutions and how you do that in sort

01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:39.289
of a post-institutional media world and world.
Jonathan Zittrain: Jonathan [Crosstalk] [01:16:39]

01:16:39.289 --> 01:16:45.020
Jonathan Alter: If I m not mistaken, Newt,
most of the broadcasters you were addressing

01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:51.139
were local, locally on broadcasters, right?
They were sort of pillars of their local communities

01:16:51.139 --> 01:16:56.780
who came to Washington for the speech and
owned a local Newt Minow: At that time, yes

01:16:56.780 --> 01:17:00.050
and there has been a lot of Jonathan Alter:
Right. Newt Minow: consolidation, right. Jonathan

01:17:00.050 --> 01:17:06.050
Alter: So there has been on one level, there
has been all this consolidation under a much

01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:10.409
smaller number of companies but there s a
countertrend that I find very intriguing that

01:17:10.409 --> 01:17:19.639
they now call hyper local news and it s using
these new technologies to report on something

01:17:19.639 --> 01:17:26.329
that will never go out of fashion which is
local news. So, you know, we ve been through

01:17:26.329 --> 01:17:33.260
this period of just awful some of the great
newspapers accepted like the Tribune but certainly

01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:40.329
off the local television news over the last
40 years and the new technologies and maybe

01:17:40.329 --> 01:17:50.460
Patch which is AOL s response to this or some
other means of reimagining local news could

01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:55.480
provide some interesting experiments on how
to use the new technology in a good way. Ann

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:59.300
Marie Lipinski: There you know, there s one
trend along these lines so I think really

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:05.130
so we re talking about, Do we reward people
who aren t innovating? There s one there has

01:18:05.130 --> 01:18:14.139
been one extraordinary generational change
and I ll use ProPublica as the best example

01:18:14.139 --> 01:18:20.099
of this or a good example of this; and that
is to say competition doesn t drive us anymore,

01:18:20.099 --> 01:18:27.070
competition to be first or to be only with
a story. This is really a remarkable shift

01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:31.679
in the way very good investigative journalists
would think about their work. So in the past,

01:18:31.679 --> 01:18:36.219
you wouldn t breathe a word of your story
with, you know, the thought of partnering

01:18:36.219 --> 01:18:44.019
which is now a verb. In journalism, it was
unheard of and yet, if you look at what Paul

01:18:44.019 --> 01:18:50.150
Steiger is doing with ProPublica, right, so
they ll say you know, a recent example, medial

01:18:50.150 --> 01:18:54.989
malpractice. We are going to go out and we
re going to basically create a template for

01:18:54.989 --> 01:19:00.590
all these newsrooms who don t have the financial
or the journalistic resources to create these

01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:05.820
stories in their own markets. So we re going
to provide free databases. We re going to

01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:12.510
provide, you know, long lists of you know,
we re going to FOI records by state. We re

01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:17.820
going to make all of this put it online, make
it available to you and actually then, you

01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:22.869
know, do workshops or, you know, demonstrate
how you might use this information in your

01:19:22.869 --> 01:19:29.700
own market. That is a huge shift in the last
50 years. I mean those broadcasters, you know,

01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:33.880
newspapers in those same markets, nobody ever
would have agreed to this; and, you know,

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:38.239
so basically Paul and his colleagues have
said if this kind of journalism is going to

01:19:38.239 --> 01:19:44.800
survive and it s as expensive as it is, you
ve got to sort of, you know, change the way

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:48.969
you think about how you re going to apportion
these costs and how you re going to share

01:19:48.969 --> 01:19:53.179
the best of this kind of reporting. That s
a phenomenal change Male Speaker: Yes. Ann

01:19:53.179 --> 01:19:57.800
Marie Lipinski: in the way journalists think
about their work and really unheard of until

01:19:57.800 --> 01:20:00.889
the last couple of years. Jonathan Zittrain:
Well, this may be [01:20:00] a really good

01:20:00.889 --> 01:20:08.409
moment to call on a triumvirate in this zone
of I think of it as two FCC commissioners,

01:20:08.409 --> 01:20:15.479
two former FCC chairmen and one shadow FCC
chairman. I m looking of course at Reed Hundt,

01:20:15.479 --> 01:20:21.630
Kevin Martin and Susan Crawford. Spanning
across political parties and appointments

01:20:21.630 --> 01:20:30.719
bipolar as it were and having been through
this incredibly transitional period at a time

01:20:30.719 --> 01:20:35.449
of great responsibility and I think it from
Ann Marie s prompting, it raises the question,

01:20:35.449 --> 01:20:40.969
To what extent can the government, let alone
a single government commission at this point,

01:20:40.969 --> 01:20:45.050
be in a position to make whatever salutary
thing we think ought to happen? s not clear

01:20:45.050 --> 01:20:49.659
we have consensus on that. More diversity,
less diversity happen. So, Reed, shall we

01:20:49.659 --> 01:20:55.179
turn to you first? Reed Hundt: I think you
should go with beauty and youth first. [Laughter]

01:20:55.179 --> 01:20:58.579
Reed Hundt: That s all you need to know Susan
Crawford: I think it s also pearls before

01:20:58.579 --> 01:21:05.110
swine Reed says with all these things. So,
I just want to put a moment here about the

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:10.690
political moment. So we have a handsome young
president and his beautiful family. They ve

01:21:10.690 --> 01:21:16.880
just been elected and this is Newt Minow s
maiden speech and he rides up to this hotel

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:21.820
and he s going into the lion s den. This is
the NAB he s talking to. They are enormously,

01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:26.239
politically powerful and I don t think this
should be called the lost the Vast Wasteland

01:21:26.239 --> 01:21:31.329
Speech. I think this is the Better Angels
Speech. This is the speech where he calls

01:21:31.329 --> 01:21:36.139
on them to search their consciousness and
think about how they could be doing a better

01:21:36.139 --> 01:21:38.789
job and remember who Jonathan Zittrain: And
actually believed that that would happen.

01:21:38.789 --> 01:21:40.699
Susan Crawford: Well yes. Jonathan Zittrain:
Yes. Susan Crawford: And remember who he was

01:21:40.699 --> 01:21:47.400
talking to. This is a distribution network.
These aren t necessarily the authors of the

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:53.119
content themselves. They re the people making
sure that it reaches each Hamlet in America.

01:21:53.119 --> 01:22:01.670
So, fast forward to today, such a speech would
be unthinkable. Cable was just a glint in

01:22:01.670 --> 01:22:08.510
Ralph Roberts eyes in 1961. He hadn t started
Comcast yet. He had a lot of fun building

01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:16.050
it up. It s now, I believe, more powerful
than those networks were as distribution networks,

01:22:16.050 --> 01:22:22.150
as a gatekeeper for the good content or the
bad and the word content itself is laughable.

01:22:22.150 --> 01:22:27.010
It must have been to you when you first heard
it. This is programming but it s viewed by

01:22:27.010 --> 01:22:32.999
the cable distributors as just content and
they re also in charge of this disruptive

01:22:32.999 --> 01:22:38.219
network that Ethan talks about internet access.
Ninety percent of Americans right now go to

01:22:38.219 --> 01:22:43.969
their local cable incumbent and they never
compete when they re buying internet access.

01:22:43.969 --> 01:22:53.349
So the political bravery of this speech is
unthinkable. Now, hope sinks into misgiving

01:22:53.349 --> 01:22:59.269
in our own time. We can t imagine this kind
of calling to conscience to make sure that

01:22:59.269 --> 01:23:04.139
there s, you know, elevated programming in
our age. So I just want to pinpoint this moment

01:23:04.139 --> 01:23:08.880
and say how exciting it is to read the speech
again and I heard it again today. I listened

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:13.329
to it and they re sort of barely laughing
at your jokes. It s a very nervous group.

01:23:13.329 --> 01:23:17.519
Jonathan Zittrain: And [01:23:13] [Indiscernible]
at the White House, of course. [Laughter]

01:23:17.519 --> 01:23:22.019
Susan Crawford: And now, more than ever, we
ve got vertically-integrated business owning

01:23:22.019 --> 01:23:27.959
both content and distribution where the advertisers
are the clients and we are all the product.

01:23:27.959 --> 01:23:34.610
Jonathan Zittrain: But now so that was clearly
pessimistic. That, I got. But the reason you

01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:38.809
can t give a speech to that group because
here you are saying, hey, when you look at

01:23:38.809 --> 01:23:42.849
the pipes, it s consolidated. Susan Crawford:
Right, but there are only four actors in America

01:23:42.849 --> 01:23:46.599
you could give that speech [Crosstalk] [01:23:43]
Jonathan Zittrain: s just that you think they

01:23:46.599 --> 01:23:50.650
could not respond to a call to conscience.
Susan Crawford: They have no reason to. Jonathan

01:23:50.650 --> 01:23:53.360
Zittrain: [Inaudible] in the room here. Susan
Crawford: They at this point, they really

01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:59.230
believe that personal preferences equals good
programming. It s the opposite of what Chairman

01:23:59.230 --> 01:24:08.099
Minow was saying in that great speech. Jonathan
Zittrain: Over to Kevin Martin. Kevin Martin:

01:24:08.099 --> 01:24:13.050
Well, I think that Susan is right about the
fact that what was truly memorable about the

01:24:13.050 --> 01:24:17.139
speech wasn t just the substance but the willingness
to take on the incumbent industry and the

01:24:17.139 --> 01:24:20.889
willingness to call on them to do something
more. I think that they were an incredibly

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:24.969
powerful industry at the time and she s probably
right. The other industries today are actually

01:24:24.969 --> 01:24:28.659
much more powerful. One of the things I m
struck by with Jonathan Alter up there is

01:24:28.659 --> 01:24:32.999
actually Bloomberg today has more correspondents
worldwide than any other news organization.

01:24:32.999 --> 01:24:38.599
They actually do even than the BBC and yet,
they currently are unable to actually get

01:24:38.599 --> 01:24:41.659
many of their news programs and their news
organizations actually on the cable channels

01:24:41.659 --> 01:24:46.969
because it competes with those same vertically-integrated
news organizations. So that s an example of

01:24:46.969 --> 01:24:51.469
what Susan, I think, is talking about with
the power by the other distributors locking

01:24:51.469 --> 01:24:57.639
out the possibilities of even others to be
providing that kind of a service today. I

01:24:57.639 --> 01:25:04.641
think that is in large part because they [01:25:00]
no longer when Newt Minow spoke to them, they

01:25:04.641 --> 01:25:10.159
viewed their main business is the entertainment
side and that they viewed the news as what

01:25:10.159 --> 01:25:14.260
they were doing in the public interest side.
It wasn t about making money on the news and

01:25:14.260 --> 01:25:18.320
I think that s what Jonathan Alter is talking
about is it s fundamentally altered and fundamentally

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:22.739
changed. They now see news as a business in
it of itself so they approach it completely

01:25:22.739 --> 01:25:28.620
differently and that s a large part of the
problem. But I guess unlike, you know, Susan,

01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:33.789
I probably would end up being a little more
optimistic on the possibility of people calling

01:25:33.789 --> 01:25:38.280
out for different kinds of change. I do think
that the commission in the last few years

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:43.130
has made more of an impact on opening up the
distribution side. Maybe not on the content

01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:47.150
origination side but I actually think about
Reed Hundt when he was chairman just a few

01:25:47.150 --> 01:25:52.650
years ago calling on the broadcasters to change
their model to deliver more children s program;

01:25:52.650 --> 01:25:58.290
and that was something that was a very similar
moment, calling on them to change the way

01:25:58.290 --> 01:26:02.070
they thought about the children. We can talk
about how effective or ineffective that has

01:26:02.070 --> 01:26:05.909
been but it actually did change the model
for them serving children and developing a

01:26:05.909 --> 01:26:11.570
new standard for being able to do that. So
I think that it is still possible and unfortunately,

01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:15.520
we see too few leaders that are probably willing
to have the same kind of courage as Mr. Minow

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:19.420
did. Jonathan Zittrain: Boy, that passes it
right there to you, Reed. There on the children

01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:22.790
s program Reed Hundt: So I have to tell you
about the children s programming. First of

01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:29.800
all, this is really Newt s fault because I
was President Clinton s FCC chair and I met

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:37.239
with Newt and he was a beacon and he was an
adviser and he also told me Kevin, you learned

01:26:37.239 --> 01:26:42.329
this too. If you re the FCC chairman, you
can actually get to do whatever you want.

01:26:42.329 --> 01:26:47.849
So I took that to heart and we decided that
we would have the broadcast industry show

01:26:47.849 --> 01:26:55.309
three hours of children s television a week
which was turned out to my surprise, a violation

01:26:55.309 --> 01:27:03.280
of the first amendment, an absolute outrage
of this was the public interest and they ran

01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:11.219
Warner Brothers ran a TV show. If there s
anyone here who was six years old in 1995,

01:27:11.219 --> 01:27:17.340
you may remember there was a show called Animaniacs
and they ran a TV show that did not feature

01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:21.800
Reed Hundt but instead a clown named Reed
Blunt. [Laughter] Jonathan Zittrain: Aboard

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:26.420
the S.S. Minnow. Reed Hundt: And the Jonathan
Zittrain: Subtle they are not. Reed Hundt:

01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:30.849
The whole show was what a complete fool this
person was and then they filed this with the

01:27:30.849 --> 01:27:39.039
FCC as proof that they were complying with
the children s television rules. Anyhow Jonathan

01:27:39.039 --> 01:27:44.289
Zittrain: Is that an answer to Kevin s question
on effective versus ineffective? Reed Hundt:

01:27:44.289 --> 01:27:51.269
you know, hard cases make bad law but what
I do want to say is that Newt was a beacon

01:27:51.269 --> 01:28:00.289
to me as he has been to all the FCC chairs
in these years. I just want to say especially

01:28:00.289 --> 01:28:04.229
to the young people here. The thing that he
taught me that I did the best I could to live

01:28:04.229 --> 01:28:11.400
up to which is to Jonathan s earlier point.
If you have the privilege to get in public

01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:18.320
office, you can t do whatever you want but
part of the job, this is what you told me

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:27.010
Newt, is to figure out who you re really representing
and then go to the people who are on the other

01:28:27.010 --> 01:28:32.840
side of those issues and tell them what you
think and don t just try to persuade them.

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:38.110
Actually use the power of law to win because
as you ve said to me maybe you might not remember

01:28:38.110 --> 01:28:44.190
this. You said, m not going to remember you
that long anyhow. [Laughter] Reed Hundt: And

01:28:44.190 --> 01:28:49.120
what really counts is that you stood up for
something, you know, in your time in government.

01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:53.159
Now of course we all remember Newt s speech
which drove Kevin and me crazy. We cold never

01:28:53.159 --> 01:28:57.360
figure out any phrase to beat vast wasteland
Jonathan Zittrain: Did you try? Were there

01:28:57.360 --> 01:29:02.010
actually Reed Hundt: Yes, I did. I gave a
we had we I didn t tell you this. You didn

01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:07.300
t know this. We actually had a contest at
the FCC where I said I would give somebody

01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:12.300
a holiday if they could think of a better
phrase. [Laughter] Jonathan Zittrain: What

01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:18.400
were some of the candidates? Reed Hundt: Well,
it morphed because of this stupid internet

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:25.710
thing into an online exercise in which people
gave different names to the FCC. Five confused

01:29:25.710 --> 01:29:30.289
commissioners, funneling cash to congress
and soon it got out of control. [Laughter]

01:29:30.289 --> 01:29:38.249
Reed Hundt: Anyhow, the bottom line is I went
to the NAB which was in Las Vegas in my time

01:29:38.249 --> 01:29:45.050
and I gave a speech in which I said we shouldn
t waste the vast land blah, blah, blah. They

01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:50.070
had a little sign outside inviting broadcasters
who wanted to come to listen. They misspelled

01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:55.355
my name and nobody actually came to the speech.
Jonathan Zittrain: It didn t say Reed Blunt.

01:29:55.355 --> 01:29:57.780
Reed Hundt: Jonathan Zittrain: Yes. Reed Hundt:
But of course the reason why times changed

01:29:57.780 --> 01:30:01.440
is because of what Susan was saying which
is, [01:30:00] you know, the pendulum had

01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:06.260
shifted and you could give the speech at the
National Cable Television Association meeting

01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:12.400
today; and in fact, the current chairman,
Chairman Genachowski in that neutrality in

01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:19.260
effect did do this to the prevailing media
of the day and said there has to be space

01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:25.789
for open content and open discussion. This
is a debate that has only begun and will continue

01:30:25.789 --> 01:30:31.090
for years and years and years and let me just
wrap this up with a note of optimism. It he

01:30:31.090 --> 01:30:36.860
did this in the same spirit that Newt brought
to the broadcasters association in 1961 because

01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:41.999
if I may say so, just to close the loop, it
doesn t matter what media you re talking to.

01:30:41.999 --> 01:30:47.420
It mattered that you are talking to the dominant
media and as long as you re addressing your

01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:52.019
comments to the dominant media on behalf of
the public, then you re doing your job. That

01:30:52.019 --> 01:30:59.840
s what you taught me. Newt Minow: I want to
say a word to the law students. You have three

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:08.849
former FCC chairmen here. All three of us
are lawyers. The current FCC chairman is a

01:31:08.849 --> 01:31:15.130
lawyer. Kevin and Julius Genachowski were
Martha s students here at the school. Reed

01:31:15.130 --> 01:31:22.969
went to Yale Law School. My point is that
law why are lawyers often chairmen of the

01:31:22.969 --> 01:31:31.159
FCC? Jonathan Zittrain: That sounds like a
beginning of a joke. Newt Minow: [Laughter]

01:31:31.159 --> 01:31:42.760
Jonathan Zittrain: Yes. Newt Minow: re dealing
with a statute. This is the only government

01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:52.789
agency that is regulating a medium of communication
and lawyers who understand the first amendment

01:31:52.789 --> 01:31:59.499
understand what a treacherous, painful, sensitive
thing that is. So for those of you who are

01:31:59.499 --> 01:32:06.760
in law school, there s a future for you at
the FCC. Jonathan Zittrain: At least for two

01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:11.280
years while you can support your family then
[01:32:09] [Inaudible]. Reed Hundt: And if

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:13.150
you went to law school with the president.
Jonathan Zittrain: And if you went to law

01:32:13.150 --> 01:32:17.429
school with the president, which could also
be, to those who also aspire, something that

01:32:17.429 --> 01:32:20.409
could happen. Ann Marie Lipinski: Could I
ask Newt a question? So we ve had lots of

01:32:20.409 --> 01:32:25.459
people, me included, suggest what the better
parts of your speech were. When you were going

01:32:25.459 --> 01:32:31.550
into that Newt, did you have a sense of A,
whether it would endure at all and B, if it

01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:36.949
would what the kind of you know, what the
critical moment in the speech was. Newt Minow:

01:32:36.949 --> 01:32:45.900
Ann Marie, it baffles me to this moment that
50 years after that speech, it is still being

01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:55.230
talked about. It baffles me. I paid no attention
to the words vast wasteland . I had a lot

01:32:55.230 --> 01:33:01.699
of people helping me with the speech, one
a very gifted writer. He had written vast

01:33:01.699 --> 01:33:12.190
wasteland of junk . I crossed of of junk and
paid no further attention to the parts of

01:33:12.190 --> 01:33:18.519
that word. I think what you said before was
a good point. The New York Times put it on

01:33:18.519 --> 01:33:31.679
the front page and I think that made it a
and I think many, many American people felt

01:33:31.679 --> 01:33:40.099
that I was basically right, that television
could do more to serve the public and I think

01:33:40.099 --> 01:33:48.980
I got thousands of letters as a result. So
but I did not anticipate this at all. Big

01:33:48.980 --> 01:33:55.639
surprise. I think the fact that it was a new
administration, a new president, a new medium,

01:33:55.639 --> 01:34:04.199
it was the time and the context; not me or
the speech. Jonathan Zittrain: Kevin Martin

01:34:04.199 --> 01:34:12.209
and Reed Hundt have raised the question of
youth and youth programming and of course

01:34:12.209 --> 01:34:19.679
Newt, you ve mentioned the youth in the room
maybe looking forward to when their turn will

01:34:19.679 --> 01:34:26.010
come to have a crack at issues like these.
It seems natural maybe to call upon John Palfrey

01:34:26.010 --> 01:34:32.000
who has been studying generational changes
and how people perceive views, the internet

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:38.570
and the information they might receive and
give over it. To what extent have people themselves

01:34:38.570 --> 01:34:44.369
been changing over the years? It s not just
the landscape getting different but people

01:34:44.369 --> 01:34:49.639
too, kids. John Palfrey: Thank you, Jonathan
and thank you Chairman Minow for the speech

01:34:49.639 --> 01:34:56.280
and the occasion to have this amazing conversation.
I slightly disagree with the idea that that

01:34:56.280 --> 01:35:00.840
speech is surprising, that it s so memorable.
I think in fact for those of us [01:35:00]

01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:05.479
reading it and rereading it sometime after
you gave it, and I was in the category of

01:35:05.479 --> 01:35:11.739
not born when you did, it has multiple layers
to it. Vast Wasteland I think was the easy

01:35:11.739 --> 01:35:16.999
headline and then as you noted, you have the
tie between communication technologies and

01:35:16.999 --> 01:35:20.719
politics and the public interest, something
I think that many of us it defines why we

01:35:20.719 --> 01:35:26.420
do what we do but then it has this third layer
in many areas where you add in to the mix

01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:31.000
not just communication technologies and public
interest and politics but children and education.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:34.579
You have in the speech the line Most young
children today, believe it or not, spend as

01:35:34.579 --> 01:35:38.559
much time watching television as they do in
the schoolroom, and which you then repeat;

01:35:38.559 --> 01:35:45.771
and it s there when you call upon the people
in the room to search their consciences. It

01:35:45.771 --> 01:35:50.349
seems to me that this is an incredibly fitting
thing for you to have called upon, particularly

01:35:50.349 --> 01:35:55.849
given where your daughter has ended up and
her husband Joe Singer, both of whom are educational

01:35:55.849 --> 01:36:00.610
reformers literally here at Harvard Law School
and who have focused on the use of technology

01:36:00.610 --> 01:36:06.469
and video and so forth. s really an amazing
kind of clarion call a long time ago to focus

01:36:06.469 --> 01:36:11.840
on the power of these technologies in these
ways and I think the answer is we don t know

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:15.369
the answer, Jonathan, to your question of
how people are changing; but we know the relevance.

01:36:15.369 --> 01:36:19.590
We know the fact that in a classroom like
this, it matters a great deal not just the

01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:22.670
formal learning that s happening here but
the informal learning that kids are getting

01:36:22.670 --> 01:36:28.809
and I actually think that the echoes are amazing
from this speech 50 years ago. It s a real

01:36:28.809 --> 01:36:33.090
gift. Jonathan Zittrain: So bracketing the
youth question then, Perry Hewitt, are you

01:36:33.090 --> 01:36:37.010
here? Where is Perry? Perry, you re the Chief
Digital Officer of Harvard University. Perry

01:36:37.010 --> 01:36:40.030
Hewitt: I am. Jonathan Zittrain: Which so
far as I can tell means you are the one who

01:36:40.030 --> 01:36:46.189
exercises the search dark arts to make sure
that we come up on searches for higher education

01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:50.749
instead of Perry Hewitt: t mess with me, Jonathan.
Jonathan Zittrain: Yes. So I don t know. Do

01:36:50.749 --> 01:36:57.889
you have a sense of reaching out to this generation
through this cacophonous set of media? Perry

01:36:57.889 --> 01:37:01.889
Hewitt: I was so struck by something Mr. Minow
said this evening in addition to his landmark

01:37:01.889 --> 01:37:08.510
speech where he said the government s job
at that point was to expand choice for viewers;

01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:13.539
and I think of today when there are 800 cable
television channels and 48 hours of YouTube

01:37:13.539 --> 01:37:17.559
video uploaded every minute. I think one of
the things we need to do both as an educational

01:37:17.559 --> 01:37:22.679
institution and as media leaders creating
programming is not only shift the focus toward

01:37:22.679 --> 01:37:28.170
creating higher quality programming but also
shift the focus toward making that programming

01:37:28.170 --> 01:37:32.320
discoverable and findable. That s a lot of
what I m trying to do here at Harvard, thinking

01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:36.670
about creating meaningful collections of the
thought leadership that happens because something

01:37:36.670 --> 01:37:40.610
that happens at the law school around 9/11
might be really tied to something that s going

01:37:40.610 --> 01:37:44.369
on at the business school and nobody has the
time to make those connections. So that s

01:37:44.369 --> 01:37:48.499
our job but when I think about media leadership,
when I think about quality programming, I

01:37:48.499 --> 01:37:52.760
think it s as big a challenge to create the
programming now but it s also an enormous

01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:57.159
challenge to make it findable and to make
it accessible to those youth who I think are

01:37:57.159 --> 01:38:01.380
desperately looking for the quality. Jonathan
Zittrain: And I got to that s exactly the

01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:08.030
challenge that Nicholas Negroponte has been
taking up in so many different modes over

01:38:08.030 --> 01:38:13.179
the years. More recently and perhaps most
well-known, the One Laptop per Child Program

01:38:13.179 --> 01:38:20.439
of trying to figure out how to create information
conduits to and from very far away places

01:38:20.439 --> 01:38:25.210
with Nicholas Negroponte: [01:38:20] [Indiscernible]
but you do really good at this. I mean you

01:38:25.210 --> 01:38:29.239
re really good. Oh my god. [Laughter] Nicholas
Negroponte: Yes, you [Applause] Jonathan Zittrain:

01:38:29.239 --> 01:38:34.840
I can t tell if that s a compliment or not.
Nicholas Negroponte: That s a compliment.

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:37.010
Jonathan Zittrain: But I ll take it. Nicholas
Negroponte: That s a real compliment. I sort

01:38:37.010 --> 01:38:42.389
of come from a slightly different world where
we spend less time reflecting and more time

01:38:42.389 --> 01:38:49.190
inventing. So I m a little bit of an interloper
here but by chance when I founded the Media

01:38:49.190 --> 01:38:54.229
Lab, my partner was in the White House with
you, Newt. It was Jerry Wiesner and he told

01:38:54.229 --> 01:39:02.179
me a story very early on when I first got
to know in the 70s about how he brought Vladimir

01:39:02.179 --> 01:39:05.420
s work into the White House. I don t know
if you remember the name but Vladimir Sworkin

01:39:05.420 --> 01:39:11.560
is generally credited with inventing television.
It was a Saturday and Jerry sent his work

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:16.550
and then I won t try and imitate Sworkin s
but it was a very heavy German accent. He

01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:21.039
said, Have you ever met the president? He
said, He said, Well, let s go see if he s

01:39:21.039 --> 01:39:25.439
in his office, and he was there and [01:39:22]
[Indiscernible]. It was a Saturday afternoon

01:39:25.439 --> 01:39:32.760
and he says, Mr. President, I want you to
meet the man who got you elected. Apparently,

01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:38.639
Kennedy said, Oh, you know, how is that? and
he said, This is the man who invented television.

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:45.050
Apparently, Kennedy said, Oh my goodness.
You did such a wonderful thing, and so on.

01:39:45.050 --> 01:39:50.280
As Jerry sort of tells that it s working,
looks at him and says, Mr. President, have

01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:57.230
you looked at television recently? [Laughter]
Nicholas Negroponte: He said, When we invented

01:39:57.230 --> 01:40:01.780
it, we thought we were inventing an educational
[01:40:00] medium. We thought we were inventing

01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:09.219
a medium for the arts, and one of the things
I took away from that story was the difference

01:40:09.219 --> 01:40:14.280
between television and photography. I m going
to use photography as an example. The people

01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:20.170
who invented television were engineers who
then threw it over the wall and various people

01:40:20.170 --> 01:40:27.699
used it. People who invented photography were
photographers and the same people who made

01:40:27.699 --> 01:40:34.070
the creative content invented the medium and
that s what I think is happening in computers.

01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:39.849
That was why we started the Media Lab, to
make a place where the inventors and the creative

01:40:39.849 --> 01:40:45.749
users were the same people; and for 25 years,
we ve been doing that and that s the reason

01:40:45.749 --> 01:40:51.300
why we from those years. Newt Minow: And do
you come out then as an optimist that while

01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:56.429
we are talking and talking policy, you re
out building? Nicholas Negroponte: m well-known

01:40:56.429 --> 01:41:02.820
as being A, unrealistic and B, an optimist
about everything so yes, very much an optimist.

01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:05.849
Jonathan Zittrain: I can t tell you if you
complimented yourself or not but [Laughter]

01:41:05.849 --> 01:41:11.590
Nicholas Negroponte: You haven t been able
to tell much since I was there but yes, I

01:41:11.590 --> 01:41:17.170
m an optimist and I m sort of sometimes so
extremely optimistic that you should, you

01:41:17.170 --> 01:41:22.170
know, not believe me. [Laughter] Jonathan
Zittrain: Which of course makes you far more

01:41:22.170 --> 01:41:27.389
credible. So it s that sort of I mean part
of I think what we ve all been grasping at

01:41:27.389 --> 01:41:35.039
so far is capturing the kind of authenticity
that this medium could allow. Maybe it did,

01:41:35.039 --> 01:41:40.439
maybe it didn t, trying to elicit it from
the medium and trying to achieve the same

01:41:40.439 --> 01:41:46.340
thing today as more and more choices are there
and many of the doors have false ones behind

01:41:46.340 --> 01:41:51.969
them and others may have [01:41:47] [Indiscernible]
that otherwise wouldn t come through. We are

01:41:51.969 --> 01:41:57.050
nearing the end of our time. We haven t even
had a chance to open it up because to sort

01:41:57.050 --> 01:42:05.719
of unpredictable characters because we have
not predictable characters. Predicted characters.

01:42:05.719 --> 01:42:09.499
That didn t sound like a compliment at all.
Jonathan Alter: It didn Jonathan Zittrain:

01:42:09.499 --> 01:42:14.269
m just trying to make Susan s pearls before
swine comment recede but I just failed at

01:42:14.269 --> 01:42:18.790
that too. Female Speaker: You say something
funny, you don t need to be Jonathan Zittrain:

01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:23.559
So I don John, I m just going to call on you
real quick as sort of a proxy, given we have

01:42:23.559 --> 01:42:30.620
so little time though, for those voices that
haven t been organized ahead of time. You

01:42:30.620 --> 01:42:34.969
ve actually had your eye on the Twitter stream
so I hate to have that kind of old CNN moment

01:42:34.969 --> 01:42:39.820
where they re like, So what does so and so
in Baghdad have to say? but I m curious. Is

01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:45.119
there anything different that has been happening
in response to this online that hasn t yet

01:42:45.119 --> 01:42:48.729
found its way to the floor here? John Palfrey:
I was struck that you were actually RT-ing

01:42:48.729 --> 01:42:53.040
the comment by Susan Crawford about pearls
before swine in real time but Jonathan Zittrain:

01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:55.969
Pearls before swine John Palfrey: Yes. That
s even better, right? Pearls before swine.

01:42:55.969 --> 01:43:01.880
There s a huge amount of Twitter traffic on
here. A lot of it actually is of course reflecting

01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:08.209
on things happening in the room but also some
wondering what Chairman Minow makes of 140

01:43:08.209 --> 01:43:13.739
characters in this sort of short form discussions
on Twitter. So I don t know if there s a way

01:43:13.739 --> 01:43:18.969
that this could be one last question back
to the great man but the social media that

01:43:18.969 --> 01:43:21.900
has Jonathan Zittrain: Yes. John Palfrey:
been in the back channel of this room and

01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:27.679
other rooms that are watching the webcast
are kind of wondering about real time feedback

01:43:27.679 --> 01:43:31.130
from you. Jonathan Zittrain: So the last question,
Twitter, threat or menace? [Laughter] Newt

01:43:31.130 --> 01:43:41.099
Minow: Well, I would like to make one comment.
I think the more communication, the better.

01:43:41.099 --> 01:43:47.920
I would like to thank you for inviting me
today. Fifty years, it s hard to believe you

01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:58.139
re still thinking about a speech 50 years
ago. Jonathan who is in my view the Scotty

01:43:58.139 --> 01:44:06.110
Reston of today s generation of political
journalists, Ann Marie who has not only won

01:44:06.110 --> 01:44:12.519
a Pulitzer but won the admiration of everybody
in her field and we re glad she s here at

01:44:12.519 --> 01:44:18.599
Harvard. Yochai, I ve never met you before
today but I read your work and I admire it

01:44:18.599 --> 01:44:26.639
and I m delighted that I was invited here
today. I see somebody here who will one day

01:44:26.639 --> 01:44:35.829
be chairman of the FCC and when that happens,
I hope you will remember that the two words

01:44:35.829 --> 01:44:47.709
in that statute, the public interest, still
have a meaning which too often is easily forgotten.

01:44:47.709 --> 01:44:53.739
Jonathan Zittrain: I am pleased then to turn
the proceedings, with you having successfully

01:44:53.739 --> 01:44:57.535
not answered the Twitter question, over to
our chairman, Terry Fisher, [01:45:00] to

01:44:57.535 --> 01:45:14.059
bring us in for a landing. Terry. Terry Fisher:
So, as many people have rightly pointed out

01:45:14.059 --> 01:45:23.280
some extraordinarily rich and diverse discussion,
impossible to summarize. So instead of making

01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:32.539
that attempt, I thought I would try to identify
a few of the themes upon which there seems

01:45:32.539 --> 01:45:42.429
to be agreement in the room and a few comments
on them. So, it strikes me that the conversation

01:45:42.429 --> 01:45:50.790
has revealed the extent to which technology
and it should be emphasized. Social practices

01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:57.670
that are enabled but not dictated by those
technologies have are in the process of corroding

01:45:57.670 --> 01:46:04.010
some fundamental divides that have shaped
and structured information, entertainment

01:46:04.010 --> 01:46:09.249
and our senses ourselves. So, here are the
divides, as I say, just picking up on themes

01:46:09.249 --> 01:46:15.350
that emerged in the discussions. First is
that division between public and private,

01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:23.239
the reversal of the trend of the 19th century
which was sharp separation of large institutions

01:46:23.239 --> 01:46:28.489
into two discreet categories, governments,
institutions intentionally pursuing the public

01:46:28.489 --> 01:46:34.920
interest on the one hand and private parties
coordinated primarily by the invisible hand

01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:40.889
and nothing more. That division which began
in the early 19th century and hardened by

01:46:40.889 --> 01:46:49.530
1900 is now being reversed and the clearest
manifestation is the emergence of extraordinarily

01:46:49.530 --> 01:46:54.099
powerful new aggregators and channelers of
information of which Google would be the easiest

01:46:54.099 --> 01:46:59.780
example. So in this contest, I would suggest
in response to Ellen. We re not in a post-institutional

01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:07.420
world. It s just the most powerful institutions
are changing and they are arising in between

01:47:07.420 --> 01:47:13.809
the zone of public and private. Other divides
that are deteriorating fast or that are traditional

01:47:13.809 --> 01:47:21.099
divides include that between professional
and amateur, that between speaker and audience,

01:47:21.099 --> 01:47:26.989
that as Virginia suggested between news and
entertainment. Always a fuzzy boundary but

01:47:26.989 --> 01:47:33.429
blurring ever more so now and finally, it
should be emphasized here, the boundary between

01:47:33.429 --> 01:47:39.610
the university and society at large as we
collectively do and should direct our voices

01:47:39.610 --> 01:47:47.559
less at our own communities and more out.
So these changes, the corrosion of all these

01:47:47.559 --> 01:47:56.830
divides have had all of the speakers seem
to be suggesting both huge benefits and huge

01:47:56.830 --> 01:48:03.099
costs. The benefits include the democratization
of the process information and entertainment

01:48:03.099 --> 01:48:11.369
production, the collapse of oligopolies and
the reduction of bias of the story that Ethan

01:48:11.369 --> 01:48:18.199
is working to undermine. An increase in the
amount of depth and potential for accuracy

01:48:18.199 --> 01:48:26.119
exemplified for example by the story of the
Hussein hanging. A dramatic increase in the

01:48:26.119 --> 01:48:32.769
direction to return to one of Newt s original
provocations of a free society as opposed

01:48:32.769 --> 01:48:41.230
to a closed society manifested in the contribution
contested of the internet and new media to

01:48:41.230 --> 01:48:47.059
[01:48:40] [Indiscernible] and the revolutions
sweeping North Africa and finally, the resurrection

01:48:47.059 --> 01:48:55.479
of new kinds of communities. We are bulling
alone less often now. Big benefits, huge benefits.

01:48:55.479 --> 01:48:59.550
At the same time, there are corresponding
costs that have received a lot of attention

01:48:59.550 --> 01:49:08.230
here. They include the fragmentation, the
loss of a coherent culture, the Tower of Babel,

01:49:08.230 --> 01:49:16.280
the threat of sacrificing content, context,
at least if Jonathan is correct, for the majority

01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:26.320
of people and the superficiality of what Ethan
refers to as the special power of video programming.

01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:32.329
So we ve got massive changes underway, partly
technological, partly social, impossible to

01:49:32.329 --> 01:49:39.059
stop with some very large benefits and some
very large costs. So, accepting Newt s invitation

01:49:39.059 --> 01:49:46.340
to look forward, it strikes me that there
are underway a couple of additional advantages

01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:52.510
that have not received too much attention
here and a method that Yochai in his comment

01:49:52.510 --> 01:49:57.719
highlighted of ameliorating the cost. The
benefit that we haven t talked about much

01:49:57.719 --> 01:50:04.349
is the advantage in changing [01:50:00] the
people who contribute to this now democratized

01:50:04.349 --> 01:50:09.679
process of generating information. We focused
on the quality of the stuff they generate

01:50:09.679 --> 01:50:15.489
not on what it does to us as producers. So
this new environment is one in which we are

01:50:15.489 --> 01:50:24.489
collectively with extraordinary breadth, as
John Palfrey has revealed in his work, producers

01:50:24.489 --> 01:50:31.050
of the culture in which we live. We are engaged.
We are no longer primarily passive, one of

01:50:31.050 --> 01:50:39.349
the accusations Newt convincingly made in
the 1960s. Semiotic democracy is in part a

01:50:39.349 --> 01:50:47.110
virtue because of what it does to us. OK,
that s the extra benefit I wanted to emphasize.

01:50:47.110 --> 01:50:54.260
Now, the method of ameliorating the cost that
Yochai touched upon, that he wanted to emphasize,

01:50:54.260 --> 01:51:01.249
is we are seeing and could see more of the
emergence of innovated, distributed models

01:51:01.249 --> 01:51:08.239
for sifting, vetting as you suggested, curating
and organizing information. They include,

01:51:08.239 --> 01:51:13.739
as we have often remarked, Wikipedia. They
often also include in the technological space

01:51:13.739 --> 01:51:20.349
collective sites like Slashdot and then they
include within the universities projects the

01:51:20.349 --> 01:51:25.920
sort exemplified here by digital humanities
pioneered by Jeffrey Schnapp, which for example

01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:31.969
is providing a remarkably deep, new way of
organizing information; some of it video,

01:51:31.969 --> 01:51:38.610
some of it non-video about the Japanese tsunami.
A way of gathering information together and

01:51:38.610 --> 01:51:45.599
making it widely available that television
never achieved and could not achieve. So,

01:51:45.599 --> 01:51:57.150
my hope is that we, focusing on these potentials,
can accept Nicholas spirit of optimism rather

01:51:57.150 --> 01:52:05.079
than pessimism, to see that it is in our power
to inflect, not halt the developments. It

01:52:05.079 --> 01:52:15.999
may be here a heresy in this room that the
FCC is not the prime mover any longer, recognizing

01:52:15.999 --> 01:52:22.969
the rapid emergence and growing power of the
intermediaries and the diminution in opportunities

01:52:22.969 --> 01:52:30.479
for genuine, progressive, regulatory change
at the governmental level. That it is the

01:52:30.479 --> 01:52:36.269
growing intermediaries of which Google is
only the first where the real power locates

01:52:36.269 --> 01:52:43.260
and that s where we should concentrate our
energies and seek ways of moving this environment

01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:49.429
in the direction of the public interest. Jonathan
Zittrain: Terry, you managed to give us a

01:52:49.429 --> 01:52:56.019
perfect synthesis of everything that happened
and to ask us to shake ourselves by the lapels,

01:52:56.019 --> 01:53:05.820
to take up the opportunities that are offered
by this new environment. We now get to eliminate

01:53:05.820 --> 01:53:14.050
the divide between speakers and audience as
we thank our special contributors, our respondents,

01:53:14.050 --> 01:53:21.360
Jonathan, Ann Marie, Yochai and most of all
Newt Minow and in fact, all three Minows.

01:53:21.360 --> 01:53:23.809
We ve learned so much. The School of Minows
Newt Minow: Thank you so much. [Applause]
