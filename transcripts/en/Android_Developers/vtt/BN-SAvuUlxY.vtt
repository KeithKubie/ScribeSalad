00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.860
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Good morning everyone and welcome
to the first ever episode of The Developers

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.170
Strike Back.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.520
This is the opportunity for all of the developers
who we gave candid feedback to during the

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.160
App Clinic on Friday, and whose design skills
we tore apart on Android Design in Action,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.330
just this last Tuesday to tell us exactly
what they think about what we told them.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.960
My name is Reto.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.180
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'm Ian.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.770
Now, joining us today are four developers
not in the studio because I was able to file

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.750
a restraining order in time, but live via
Google+ Hangout.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.160
And who are the developers today Reto?

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.940
&gt;&gt; MEIER: We have--we have a bunch of guys.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.750
So, we've got Mattias from Yoga Timer.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.170
We have Carlos from Timer, Alarm, Stopwatch
&amp; Clock.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.980
And that's right everyone I'm reading this
of a piece of paper in front of me.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:05.850
Impetus developer Harry Ohra-aho and Hybrid--is
it Hybrid Timer, Hybrid Stopwatch, it's Javier

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.850
Salmona.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.110
So, yeah, thank you guys for joining.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.770
We're going to bring each of them up on screen
as we go through each of the apps and give

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.429
them a chance to tell us exactly what they
think of us.

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:19.500
I think before we get started we should remind
everyone of exactly what we were telling these

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.969
guys they should be doing last Friday.

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.590
And so that's the prescriptions for a great
timer or stopwatch apps.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.939
So, again and these are things which I think
you guys are familiar with, you know, not

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.909
contradicting the design guide, having as
much functionality as possible, rich notifications

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.469
which really turned out to be a differentiator
for a lot of the apps I think and keeping

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:40.469
it simple.

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:44.759
So, as we--as we mentioned beforehand, these
are the apps which we're going to check out.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.070
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, you skipped user service
but I think that's because we--when we talked

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.189
about it, it really--using notifications and
applies a service anyway.

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:53.189
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.189
Exactly.

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.899
So, we could tell that just from the fact
that everyone was using notifications one

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.139
way or the other.

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:02.459
So, let's see if we can spend a couple of
minutes introducing the folks.

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:05.649
So, if you want to try and bring everyone
up one at the time now.

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.149
We also got Roman.

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.869
I forgot Roman.

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.010
Hi Roman.

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:15.840
So, Roman is going to stand in for the Android
Design in Action Team and take all of the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.069
constructive feedback that the developers
have around the redesigns which you guys did.

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.120
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Now, do we have the beautiful
marks too?

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.120
&gt;&gt; MEIER: We do.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.290
We have the beautiful marks setup which we
will put up before we talk about the each

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.290
app so, we're going toů
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Excellent.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.040
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ůwe're going to put each of you
guys up on screen.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.050
&gt;&gt; This is Carlos.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.450
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, this is Carlos.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.629
Do you want to introduce yourself briefly,
tell us which app you are responsible for?

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah, of course.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.629
Carlos from Barcelona.

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:53.500
I work in a company that works in developing
software for mobiles, iOS and Android, everything.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.130
[INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very cool.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.780
So, we really like your app, Time, Alarm,
Stopwatch and Clock.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.780
It was one of our favorites.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.989
So, we'll look forward to checking it out.

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.640
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: We like your Cydia too although
it's all sort of blur to me after MWC.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.079
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, we were regular visitors to
Barcelona and yeah, we took our time.

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.079
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.079
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Cool.

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.079
All right.

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:15.079
Soů
&gt;&gt; Next up is Harri.

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.360
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Let's go back.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.800
So, this is Harri from Impetus.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.800
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: Yes.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.800
Harri Ohra-aho from Finland.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.800
Hello everybody.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.569
And I'm a professional Java developer in a
company called Solita and I'm a sort of an

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.540
Android hobbyist by night.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:32.540
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Awesome, awesome.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.640
And so I think how a lot of us got started
with Android is--outside of our day job.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.799
So, yeah, that's cool.

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:38.860
Thanks for joining us.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.549
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: Thank you.

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.319
&gt;&gt; Next is Javier.

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:44.169
I'll be translating for him.

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:45.169
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Javier.

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.409
And producer Daniel is going to be translating
for Javier.

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:51.149
So, this is the developer of Hybrid Stopwatch.

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:52.149
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:56.400
Next stop is Mattias .
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Mattias , this is another friend

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.410
from the Nordics.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.690
Developer of Yoga Timer.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.579
I think you're muted.

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.359
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I think you're muted.

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.590
&gt;&gt; BERGANDER: Oh, that's why.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.810
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Here you go.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.489
&gt;&gt; BERGANDER: Thank you.

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:10.489
Yeah.

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.379
I'm developed the app Yoga Timer.

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:21.020
I'm from Sweden [INDISTINCT] and also a professional
Java developer from a company called Consat.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.720
And I'm utilized into Android stuff during
my free time.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.720
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very cool.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.230
It seems like a lot of Java developers up
on Nordics.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.330
I wonder--I wonder where that could be.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.930
So, as it happens we're going to start of
with Yoga Timer.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.920
So, let's talk a little bit about that app.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:08:32.650
So, could you maybe tell--as well, justů
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:08:32.650 --> 00:09:34.810
&gt;&gt; BERGANDER: As you mentioned you have the
buttons on the bottom as well.

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:40.890
So, it was kind of hard to--I'm thinking about
the--some other apps that actually do something

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:47.140
nice or they don't show the ads the first
few days so you'd get used to the app and

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.140
feel that.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.420
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:51.370
It's actually interesting [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; BERGANDER: That's kind of nice.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.620
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I mean, one thing that you may want
to consider doing and I don't know how many

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.130
developers have sort of tried something like
this.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:02.120
But something I--it could be interesting is
to actually have some A/B testing of your

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.120
app in the wild.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.120
&gt;&gt; BERGANDER: Uh-hmm.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.000
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So than you can basically randomly
decide between one or two different alternative

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.840
for ads and then try and measure the click
through rate and the effectiveness to see

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.530
whether, you know, are you getting more ad
impressions.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:18.830
Are you getting people who continue using
the app more or less based on where those

00:10:18.830 --> 00:10:23.170
ads go and that might be interesting to see
what some of the best alternatives are.

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:24.170
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.170
&gt;&gt; BERGANDER: Yeah.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.060
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But, you know, the [INDISTINCT]
that I'm going to take from all of that is

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:37.010
Mattias was able to put together a completely
design guide complaint app when he was under

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:38.010
the gun.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:39.360
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very true.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.360
Yeah.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.741
Yeah, soů
&gt;&gt; BERGANDER: To a browser had a lot of nice

00:10:43.741 --> 00:10:50.120
resources and you have a couple of nice guys
over at Google+ and you have the community

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:57.790
there and the [INDISTINCT] and app or UI patterns
and [INDISTINCT] I mean, you guys, there's

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.770
all the resource out there.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:00.770
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Sweet.

00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:01.770
Thank you for the compliments.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:03.660
You're free gift will be in the mail.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.660
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.320
Very timely we're up for review this quarter,
so.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:09.320
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Perfect.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.100
So, you know, we've only got the shorter shows
today.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:17.070
So we're going to move along to the next app,
but thank you very much for joining us and

00:11:17.070 --> 00:11:18.070
stick around.

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.500
Hopefully, we'll have a few minutes in the
end and we can bring [INDISTINCT] own back

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:22.500
together.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.500
But thank you for this.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.820
Thank for the app and for coming in the show.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.830
&gt;&gt; I think Roman has a comment and he wants
to add.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:28.830
Roll it.

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:29.830
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, fire away Roman.

00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:30.830
&gt;&gt; NURIK: Yeah.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:36.220
A one super quick comment since you guys were
talking about kind of first time used.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.360
So, in our design guidelines we have a section
on help, providing help but I also want to

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.070
call up this third party library called the
showcase of you on GitHub.

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:49.910
It has the kind of like circularly blue thing
that can highlight a specific you UI element.

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:55.570
That can highlight a specific UI element that
you want to kind of drive people towards to

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:56.910
any help, that's what you call.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:01.320
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, you thought using the same sort
of UI as the first you start Android and you

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:02.320
get the littleů
&gt;&gt; NURIK: Okay.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.700
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ůwhen you hit the launch for the
first time, that sort of thing?

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.700
&gt;&gt; NURIK: Uh-hmm.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.700
Yeah.

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:08.700
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very cool, very cool.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:09.700
Yes.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:10.700
So, Roman makes sure you include a link on
the--on the event page.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.700
Soů
&gt;&gt; NURIK: Will do.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.700
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ůpeople can find that easily.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:13.700
Excellent.

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:18.090
So, we're going to move on now to our next
app which is Timer, Alarm, Stopwatch &amp; Clock

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:19.529
by Carlos.

00:12:19.529 --> 00:12:22.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Carlos covers all the basis.

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.240
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:26.650
So, absolutely nails the various things that
we said.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:31.779
So, we'll going to quickly put up the prescriptions
that we had through and go through that first.

00:12:31.779 --> 00:12:33.260
So, yeah.

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:35.570
Design guidelines, we gave a tick, time and
stopwatch.

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:40.290
So, I think the concerns here we had around
the rich notifications which weren't as rich

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.290
as some of the other apps.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:46.370
And I think we were not in entirely convinced
that it was using a service in a right way.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.769
I think that the stopwatch there was no notification
for stopwatchů

00:12:48.769 --> 00:12:49.769
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:12:49.769 --> 00:12:51.070
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ůwhich implied no ongoing notification.

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:56.720
So, do you want to tell us a little bit about
the app before we get too stuck in to the

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.720
review?

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:04.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yes, I am--years ago--few years ago,
I'm staying [INDISTINCT] and doing well at

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:06.560
some files [INDISTINCT].

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:13.230
I have to wait--I have to wait a couple of
seconds [INDISTINCT].

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:17.250
And I start to make my first app which is
called now.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:18.330
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very nice.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.060
It's a beautiful looking app.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.350
&gt;&gt; I mean [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:23.720
&gt;&gt; To learn more.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.780
I used to [INDISTINCT] more and more and it
is a kind of [INDISTINCT].

00:13:28.780 --> 00:20:01.860
Nowů
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very coolů How you get on over

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:02.860
time.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:03.860
All right.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:07.490
We're going to--we're going to jump ahead
to the next app, just being conscious of time.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.960
So, thank you very much for joining us today.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:12.789
And stick around and hopefully we can have
another chat at the end.

00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:15.059
But--yeah, thanks and congratulations on a
great app.

00:20:15.059 --> 00:20:16.059
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:20:16.059 --> 00:20:17.059
Thank you.

00:20:17.059 --> 00:20:18.059
&gt;&gt; MEIER: All right.

00:20:18.059 --> 00:20:21.919
So, we're going to move on now to one of the
two apps that got reviewed during the--not

00:20:21.919 --> 00:20:24.899
the Fridayů
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: The weekly.

00:20:24.899 --> 00:20:28.100
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ůthe Tuesday Android Design in
Action show.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.100
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.100
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I'm struggling with my words today.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.320
And it must be--because we're doing the show
earlier than we usually do.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.860
I don't really get started before mid day.

00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.860
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yup.

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:36.860
And you hadn't have enough coffee.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:37.860
&gt;&gt; MEIER: No, no.

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:38.860
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And I haven't had another alcohol.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:39.860
&gt;&gt; MEIER: No.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:40.860
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I haveů
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Not enough of anything.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:41.860
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:42.860
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, this is--this is Impetus.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:43.860
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I can work on that.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.860
&gt;&gt; MEIER: We really do.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.340
And this is from Harri who we have on screen
at the moment.

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:49.909
So hi, thank you for joining us.

00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:52.719
You want to tell us a little bit about yourself
and about the app?

00:20:52.719 --> 00:20:53.909
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: Okay.

00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:55.450
Thank you for having me.

00:20:55.450 --> 00:21:01.690
So, Impetus it's--it came from--I'm--I have
been doing a lot of interval training of myself

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:06.190
for a couple of years, three years maybe.

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:11.419
And there were already a lot of timers for
this sort of specialized.

00:21:11.419 --> 00:21:13.929
But they didn't have all the stuff I needed.

00:21:13.929 --> 00:21:16.860
So, they didn't work reliably.

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:25.700
They had poor sort of audio or visual cues
and they--the sort of timing engine as didn't

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:31.799
have a sort of all the stuff I wanted to have
because I wanted to do sort of more complex

00:21:31.799 --> 00:21:32.799
workoutsů
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:21:32.799 --> 00:21:35.230
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: ůthan they need--than they could
do.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:41.230
So, this is sort of from my own need and then
I just wanted to publish it and see if somebody

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:42.860
else wants to have it.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:50.019
So, what I aim for was sort of--you have to
have a really clearer display because when

00:21:50.019 --> 00:21:53.909
doing interval training you're going to be
sort of exhausted and you can't see for five

00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:55.700
meters ahead of you.

00:21:55.700 --> 00:21:58.610
So, you have--so, you have to have some big
numbers and stuff like that.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:59.610
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:00.610
We can see that on the screen.

00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:01.610
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:04.700
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You got the big bolds, you know,
bright white numbers which take up, you know,

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.070
a big part of the screen.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.220
So, that'sů
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.220
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ůit's interesting.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:12.980
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: And then I want to have a landscape
mode because most didn't have it, so I have

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.970
dedicated it you for thatů
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, cool.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:21.059
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: ůso it sort of changes to different
buttons and whatever.

00:22:21.059 --> 00:22:24.049
And the--and then theů
&gt;&gt; MEIER: We didn't actually didn't looků

00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:26.210
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: ůthat sort ofů
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ůat the landscape mode when we

00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:28.682
looked at it during the show that's--it's
definitely a best alternative.

00:22:28.682 --> 00:22:31.210
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: And then the--yeah.

00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:35.919
Then the timing mechanics, I wanted to have
a timer that you can use if you just want

00:22:35.919 --> 00:22:41.429
to have a really simple workout or if you
really want to go wild with something really

00:22:41.429 --> 00:22:42.429
weird.

00:22:42.429 --> 00:22:43.429
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-huh.

00:22:43.429 --> 00:22:49.030
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: So, there's an two edit modes
so you can have a basic that you looked at.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:54.289
So, there's such--sort of really normal work
and rest and whatever and rounds.

00:22:54.289 --> 00:23:00.990
And then you have another sort of Mr. Hide,
you just met the--Dr. Jekyll, there's sort

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:03.129
of a Mr. Hide.

00:23:03.129 --> 00:23:08.440
There's the advance mode where you can sort
of--there's a drag and drop interface in whatever.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:12.859
It's a short for tree structure and with a
little loops and stuff like that.

00:23:12.859 --> 00:23:15.889
It's pretty far out there.

00:23:15.889 --> 00:23:21.309
So, I sort of wanted to push the limit of
what the internal timer can do.

00:23:21.309 --> 00:23:29.239
So, you can have really many sets there, you
can have--like, you said in the options that

00:23:29.239 --> 00:23:34.799
you can have pyramids where the time is sort
of alternating and stuff like that.

00:23:34.799 --> 00:23:35.870
So, it'sů
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:36.870
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: ůpretty advanced.

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:37.870
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Interesting.

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:41.240
So, yeah, I think--it's interesting I think
one of the challenges for the advance mode

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:46.149
where sort of playing with it on a screen
that you can't see.

00:23:46.149 --> 00:23:49.559
Just to see sort of what you're talking about
and you write it, it looks like there's quite

00:23:49.559 --> 00:23:51.789
an advance set of things that you can do.

00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:58.509
I think--and maybe this is because neither
in--nor I--this kind of interval training,

00:23:58.509 --> 00:23:59.509
I don't know.

00:23:59.509 --> 00:24:00.509
I don't want to speak for you Ian.

00:24:00.509 --> 00:24:02.509
Is this is what you disappear off to do every
evening?

00:24:02.509 --> 00:24:04.279
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Not in this manner now.

00:24:04.279 --> 00:24:05.549
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Not in this manner.

00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:08.600
So, I think the fact that neither of us are
particularly experience for this makes it

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:15.989
a little bit harder to understand, but I think
the work flow around the advance sort of view

00:24:15.989 --> 00:24:18.419
could be a little bit more intuitive.

00:24:18.419 --> 00:24:22.369
It sort of doesn't give me a lot of help if
don't already know what I'm trying to do.

00:24:22.369 --> 00:24:25.909
And this is an app you design for yourself
that makes perfect sense, right?

00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:27.480
Because you just build the work flow thatů
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: Yeah.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:28.719
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ůmakes sense to you.

00:24:28.719 --> 00:24:29.899
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: Yeah.

00:24:29.899 --> 00:24:32.700
Or if it depends on the person.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.359
Some people have it--that they don't really
understand anything, so that's true.

00:24:36.359 --> 00:24:40.609
But, many people have said that, yeah, this
is--this is really the way to do it, that

00:24:40.609 --> 00:24:42.360
they can sort of makeů
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.360
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: ůtheir way around.

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's all true.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.360
I think I'm getting the hang on this.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.360
Y
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Of course.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.360
I don't think that's a bad interface at all.

00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:53.779
You know actually what it reminds me a lot
of maybe because I've done--doing so much

00:24:53.779 --> 00:24:59.629
and in the Adobe tools, you know, where you
remove layers and such so, yeah, I think there's

00:24:59.629 --> 00:25:01.620
some--I see that'sů
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.220
That makes sense, yeah.

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:06.009
We're playing with that--just off your camera.

00:25:06.009 --> 00:25:08.620
I think the people watching at YouTube broadcast
can see, but yeah.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:11.919
It's sort of--once you've add out a few things
it starts to make a lot of sense.

00:25:11.919 --> 00:25:12.919
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:25:12.919 --> 00:25:18.110
I think for something that's as complex is
this it's hard to see how it could get a whole

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.749
lot better.

00:25:19.749 --> 00:25:26.259
I think maybe, you know, and an easier way
to add rounds for instanceů

00:25:26.259 --> 00:25:27.259
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:25:27.259 --> 00:25:32.379
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ůyou know, one thing that I've
appreciated about some programs like this

00:25:32.379 --> 00:25:36.750
is that if you just drag things to the left
or to the right it'll sort of infer, you know,

00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:40.809
okay you're dragging it to the right that
means you want it to be part of a set or aroundů

00:25:40.809 --> 00:25:42.559
&gt;&gt; MEIER: As if you're trying toů
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ů[INDISTINCT] now.

00:25:42.559 --> 00:25:43.559
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:25:43.559 --> 00:25:44.559
Okay.

00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:45.559
That's cool.

00:25:45.559 --> 00:25:46.559
That's interesting.

00:25:46.559 --> 00:25:47.559
I'm just going to bring up real quick the
tips that we had.

00:25:47.559 --> 00:25:50.909
So, I think one of the things here was we
commented that it didn't have the really rich

00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:55.529
notifications that some of the design elements
where a little bit off from what the design

00:25:55.529 --> 00:25:56.529
guide says.

00:25:56.529 --> 00:25:57.529
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:25:57.529 --> 00:26:00.929
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And to the fact that it lacked the
stopwatch functions as well.

00:26:00.929 --> 00:26:06.340
Frankly I think, you know, given what you've
described as the purpose for the app I think

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:11.159
it kind of make sense why there isn't a stopwatch
there to begin with, but I think again based

00:26:11.159 --> 00:26:12.959
on what Ian was saying earlierů
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:26:12.959 --> 00:26:16.549
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ůit's kind of a piece of functionality
you may want to have while you're doing this

00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:17.970
sort of exercises as well.

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:19.820
Soů
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, let me--let me give you

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:20.820
example.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:26.479
In this maybe unique for the way that I work
out, but sometimes I'll be working out, you

00:26:26.479 --> 00:26:30.080
know, in some sort of timed manner and then
I'm just, you know, feeling really good I

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.710
want it to just keep going and so what I want
is--at the very least I want the timer to

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:35.970
countdown past zeroů
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And keep going?

00:26:35.970 --> 00:26:36.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ůso I keep--yeah.

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:37.970
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That makes sense.

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:38.970
That makes sense.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:40.380
I mean is that something that, you know, you're
interested in doing?

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:42.149
Do you want--do you--you know, [INDISTINCT]
it againstů

00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:44.889
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Or is it just that I'm not nearly
is disciplined asů

00:26:44.889 --> 00:26:47.669
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Maybe that's what you need less
stopwatches and more discipline.

00:26:47.669 --> 00:26:48.669
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: There you go.

00:26:48.669 --> 00:26:52.049
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Well, what are your thoughts, you
know, is that piece of functionality and you'd

00:26:52.049 --> 00:26:55.509
consider putting in or is that, you know,
to your mind sort of outside the scope of

00:26:55.509 --> 00:26:57.039
what you're trying to build?

00:26:57.039 --> 00:27:01.429
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: Probably not to--as a sort of
dedicated feature because, yeah, it's out

00:27:01.429 --> 00:27:02.429
of the scope.

00:27:02.429 --> 00:27:05.450
But, there's sort of is a stopwatch there.

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:12.779
You don't have to--have to know it because
in the--in the--if you're using--there's a

00:27:12.779 --> 00:27:18.950
sort of log there that you add there--you
can go to the preferences and then you're

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:20.739
going to add a third box in there actually.

00:27:20.739 --> 00:27:21.739
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh.

00:27:21.739 --> 00:27:25.870
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: Which is the sort of a skip button
and you can't use a log that's once you--when

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:30.610
you punch it the skip a button it's going
to record the time that was elapsed.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:31.889
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh.

00:27:31.889 --> 00:27:33.150
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I see.

00:27:33.150 --> 00:27:34.150
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: At that point.

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:35.150
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Got it.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:38.200
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: In then you--in the end you're
going to have a sort of a rundown that you

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:43.320
took 15 seconds on the first interval then
you took a 25 and so on.

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.019
So, it is there but sure it's not too obvious.

00:27:45.019 --> 00:27:46.089
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's a little hidden.

00:27:46.089 --> 00:27:47.089
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:27:47.089 --> 00:27:50.960
Well you also have a shake to skip and shake
to startů

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.960
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.190
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ůwhich I think is really coolů
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:54.190
Nice.

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:57.470
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ůthat's sounds super useful
for a workout, you know, unless your hands

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:59.289
are [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; MEIER: [INDISTINCT]

00:27:59.289 --> 00:28:01.539
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And like--well, yeah.

00:28:01.539 --> 00:28:07.190
But, I--it--yeah, this is--this is perennial
problem with all--well all applications in

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:08.739
general mobile apps especially this.

00:28:08.739 --> 00:28:12.169
You know, how I would have found that unless
I was browsing through the setting menu which

00:28:12.169 --> 00:28:13.479
a lot of people don't do.

00:28:13.479 --> 00:28:14.479
Soů
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: Yeah.

00:28:14.479 --> 00:28:15.479
That's true.

00:28:15.479 --> 00:28:19.710
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ůlike, they could probably--I
think that Roman's advice to use the--I'm

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:20.710
sorry.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:21.710
What was the library called again?

00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:23.349
Theů
&gt;&gt; Showcase to you.

00:28:23.349 --> 00:28:24.349
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:28:24.349 --> 00:28:25.349
Showcase to you.

00:28:25.349 --> 00:28:26.349
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:28:26.349 --> 00:28:29.879
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Might help, you know, or a few--I
don't know.

00:28:29.879 --> 00:28:35.460
I hesitate to use the word toast maybe something
that pops up, you know, when you take an action,

00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:36.539
like, startingů
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:28:36.539 --> 00:28:39.989
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ůyou know, it's kind of a did
you know you can also do this a different

00:28:39.989 --> 00:28:40.989
way.

00:28:40.989 --> 00:28:43.559
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Or you could in fact--I mean, in
this--I'd be interested to see what you guys

00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:44.559
think of this.

00:28:44.559 --> 00:28:49.659
But, one alternative might be to enable something,
like, shake skip and shake stop to begin with,

00:28:49.659 --> 00:28:53.960
but the first time that it detects you doing
that rather than doing the action it says

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:59.169
"Hey shaking it like this is going to automatically
start, do you want to stop or disable this

00:28:59.169 --> 00:29:00.169
action?"

00:29:00.169 --> 00:29:03.489
So, you sort of opting people in by giving
them some warning as to what the hell is going

00:29:03.489 --> 00:29:04.489
on.

00:29:04.489 --> 00:29:05.489
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Sure and some--yeah.

00:29:05.489 --> 00:29:06.820
I think we saw some of our music players did
that right.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:07.820
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:08.820
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: The shake thing to randomize.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:09.840
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:10.840
Okay.

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:12.760
So, we're rapidly running out of time.

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.429
But, I just do want to pop up on screen.

00:29:15.429 --> 00:29:22.210
So, we're looking at the redesign that we're
in the nick and Adam did on Tuesdayů

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:23.210
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:29:23.210 --> 00:29:24.950
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You know, did you get a chance to
have a look at their redesign?

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:27.499
What did you think of the suggestions they
had?

00:29:27.499 --> 00:29:28.499
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: Yeah.

00:29:28.499 --> 00:29:33.409
I did and of course it's really beautiful
compared to what I have because they know

00:29:33.409 --> 00:29:39.939
the stuff, so they're--maybe the problem is
that it's very out of context of course.

00:29:39.939 --> 00:29:40.939
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:29:40.939 --> 00:29:44.761
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: Because they've--they probably
be in sort of looking at the--my sort of basic

00:29:44.761 --> 00:29:46.831
version, you knowů
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I would say that they'd be looking

00:29:46.831 --> 00:29:49.080
at the Jekyll version for sure.

00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:50.080
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.080
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: Yeah.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:57.679
So, sort of--sort of putting it into my apps
or they maybe a bit more work because you

00:29:57.679 --> 00:30:00.229
have to think about what it does to the advanced
side.

00:30:00.229 --> 00:30:01.229
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:30:01.229 --> 00:30:02.229
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely, yeah.

00:30:02.229 --> 00:30:04.150
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: And theů
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I think it would be relatively straight

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:08.590
forward to put the simple case in, but you're
right, you want to keep that same look and

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:10.999
feel and functionality across the entire suiteů
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: Yeah.

00:30:10.999 --> 00:30:14.299
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ůand I think there's really a lot
more to it than that, so yeah.

00:30:14.299 --> 00:30:18.330
Is--do you think it might be a direction that
you'll slowly try to head up?

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:19.990
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: Yes, probably.

00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:21.659
Becauseů
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Cool.

00:30:21.659 --> 00:30:28.109
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ůI really have to--it's true
that--it's pretty difficult for somebody to

00:30:28.109 --> 00:30:32.340
start using this, sort of fresh out of--when
you load it upů

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.340
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.509
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: ůit doesn't really say much
what you have to do.

00:30:35.509 --> 00:30:38.249
It's pretty professional sort of speaking.

00:30:38.249 --> 00:30:40.149
So, it would--certainly help.

00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:41.230
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:45.379
I think that's, you know, the big challenge
right is that I think most of us because we

00:30:45.379 --> 00:30:49.739
tend to be, you know, pretty keen on writing
code to just solve problems, right?

00:30:49.739 --> 00:30:53.989
You have something that you need down so write
an app to take care of that and then you can

00:30:53.989 --> 00:30:57.519
put it on Google Play really easy and to see
if there's anyone else who finds it useful.

00:30:57.519 --> 00:31:01.100
And it's kind of not until you get to that
certain level of popularity that you like

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:05.919
actually, you know, maybe I should turn this
into something hat anyone can use.

00:31:05.919 --> 00:31:06.919
And itů
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:31:06.919 --> 00:31:07.919
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ůcan be really--it can be a real
challenge.

00:31:07.919 --> 00:31:09.690
Thanks a lotů
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, and a lot of it also is

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:11.639
finding your audience becauseů
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:11.639 --> 00:31:15.090
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ůspecially when you're in a
crowded field like this.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:19.669
You know, I know every time I've gone looking
for an app to suite a specific purpose and

00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:20.950
I know I'm not the only one who does this.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:22.509
I'll download five or ten apps.

00:31:22.509 --> 00:31:23.509
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:24.509
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And check them out really quickly.

00:31:24.509 --> 00:31:25.509
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, right.

00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:29.539
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And so there's some things in
this app where I'm thinking "Wow I--this is

00:31:29.539 --> 00:31:33.009
exactly the feature that I wanted, but I didn't
even realized that it exist."

00:31:33.009 --> 00:31:34.009
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:31:34.009 --> 00:31:36.580
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And I think that's really the
challenge for trying to monetize your apps

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:44.639
in Google Play is to convert people that need
what you're selling and want exactly what

00:31:44.639 --> 00:31:49.169
you offer, but don't realize that you're the
guy that's going to give it to him.

00:31:49.169 --> 00:31:50.169
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:31:50.169 --> 00:31:53.470
Except--you have like that 10, 20 seconds
when they first load the app to convince them

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:58.399
that this is the app that you need, stop looking
at everything else and that's a real challenge.

00:31:58.399 --> 00:31:59.639
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:31:59.639 --> 00:32:00.869
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:32:00.869 --> 00:32:01.869
Cool.

00:32:01.869 --> 00:32:02.869
Thank you very much for joining.

00:32:02.869 --> 00:32:03.869
Again we're kind of out of time.

00:32:03.869 --> 00:32:04.869
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: Thank you.

00:32:04.869 --> 00:32:07.230
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But, I do want to spend a couple
of minutes on Hybrid as well.

00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:10.769
But, yeah, thanks for joining us and thanks
for--yeah, like, a great app.

00:32:10.769 --> 00:32:12.919
And for showing usů
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'm sorry.

00:32:12.919 --> 00:32:16.169
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ůthe doctor--the Mr. Hide version
as well, that's definitely some interestingů

00:32:16.169 --> 00:32:17.169
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's really cool.

00:32:17.169 --> 00:32:18.169
I like it a lot.

00:32:18.169 --> 00:32:19.169
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:32:19.169 --> 00:32:20.169
Nicely done.

00:32:20.169 --> 00:32:21.169
&gt;&gt; OHRA-AHO: Thank you.

00:32:21.169 --> 00:32:22.169
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Okay.

00:32:22.169 --> 00:32:25.599
So, the next app we're going to have a look
at is the Hybrid Stopwatch and Timer by Javier

00:32:25.599 --> 00:32:30.609
who I think is not entirely comfortable speaking
to us on camera, but we're going to put you

00:32:30.609 --> 00:32:34.539
on camera and have--have Daniel read up anything
that you type to us.

00:32:34.539 --> 00:32:39.440
So, if you want to give us a brief written
description, tell us a little bit about yourself

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.869
and the app, we'll have Daniel read it out
for usů

00:32:41.869 --> 00:32:42.869
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:32:42.869 --> 00:32:45.049
So, he actually has a description up here.

00:32:45.049 --> 00:32:47.940
Let me go back up andů
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Excellent.

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.739
&gt;&gt; ůread it to you guys.

00:32:49.739 --> 00:32:55.200
Javier Salmona from Chili, he's a graphic
designer and he is the author for Hybrid Stopwatch

00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.200
and Timer.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:59.729
And he's really happy to be here today with
us.

00:32:59.729 --> 00:33:00.729
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Sweet.

00:33:00.729 --> 00:33:01.729
We're really happy to have you.

00:33:01.729 --> 00:33:02.729
This isů
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Graphic designer.

00:33:02.729 --> 00:33:03.729
&gt;&gt; MEIER: This isů
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That answers a lotů

00:33:03.729 --> 00:33:09.419
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So, this was the app which had an
incredible feature graphic.

00:33:09.419 --> 00:33:14.340
Great icon, you open it up and has very distinctive
definitive look and feel and it's something

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:18.440
which in of all the apps that we had to look
at, this was the one I was most looking forward

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.440
to.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.740
So, it really passes Ian's test of, you know,
I download a half a dozen which is the one

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:24.740
that jump most likely to use.

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:25.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:29.179
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Most of them which leaves the impression,
so well done on a great looking app.

00:33:29.179 --> 00:33:33.559
You know, I think, given the fact that you're
a designer and we have a limited time.

00:33:33.559 --> 00:33:38.349
I think we should skip straight to the marks
and put them on screen.

00:33:38.349 --> 00:33:42.369
And I think Roman, you actually were the one
which messed with this graphic designer's

00:33:42.369 --> 00:33:45.580
wonderful work with an alternative suggestion.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:49.690
So why don't we start by having Roman justify
what he [INDISTINCT]

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:51.370
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Defend yourself Roman.

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:56.679
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And give Javier a chance at the
same time to maybe type down what you think

00:33:56.679 --> 00:33:58.899
of what Roman has done to your beautiful work.

00:33:58.899 --> 00:34:01.919
&gt;&gt; NURIK: So in the marks in here.

00:34:01.919 --> 00:34:07.889
I think that it's pretty clear that we just
to a different direction, right?

00:34:07.889 --> 00:34:12.540
There's --there's really, I mean, nothing
fundamentally wrong with creating a app that

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.290
uses a [INDISTINCT] I mean, it's certainly
if you want to make an app like that, that's

00:34:16.290 --> 00:34:18.480
certainly your call, it's your application.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:22.529
We just kind of thought, you know, what if
we were to take these features, the same set

00:34:22.529 --> 00:34:26.079
of features, the same kind of identity of
the app and apply some of the Holo styling.

00:34:26.079 --> 00:34:33.760
I think what we are trying to is, you know,
say it like, what it--would this make it feel

00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:38.839
more Androidy, would make kind of users that
have, you know, newer devices down to Nexus

00:34:38.839 --> 00:34:39.839
7 and so on.

00:34:39.839 --> 00:34:44.700
Would it make them feel like this actually
is an app that's better, that belonged more,

00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:45.899
we don't really know, right?

00:34:45.899 --> 00:34:47.119
I mean, these are just mocks.

00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:50.789
SO this is--this is not saying, you know,
like you should definitely follow this direction,

00:34:50.789 --> 00:34:53.300
this is kind of a "What if' scenario."

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.109
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Sounds like [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NURIK: ůbut I think, fundamentally, the

00:34:56.109 --> 00:34:59.510
one thing I did want to point out was just
the navigation.

00:34:59.510 --> 00:35:05.480
So the one--the one non-visual concern was
navigation wasn't in any button in the legacy

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.480
menu button.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:11.730
And that just, it's kind of difficult, I think
that it's--it's difficult to discover for

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:16.260
users and it's, kind of like a mash [INDISTINCT]
of navigation and actions.

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:22.289
And so, in the recent time that I did hat's
probably more important than the visual language

00:35:22.289 --> 00:35:28.200
change was just the brining up the navigation
more forward and immediately up front for

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.200
the users.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:34.640
The ability to toggle up with the stopwatch
and the timer and the ability to slide very

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.370
quickly between laps and the current stop
watch.

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:39.370
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:42.160
&gt;&gt; NURIK: So I think that'sů
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I think that's one of the big improvements,

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:46.430
I think, you know, in terms of the actual
look of the timer itself, I think, you know,

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:47.470
I could definitely go with the way out.

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:49.799
I quite like Roman's redesigning it.

00:35:49.799 --> 00:35:53.059
It looks like something which would shift
with the phone.

00:35:53.059 --> 00:35:56.799
If we have the timer or stopwatch built in,
I reckon it would look a lot like that, although

00:35:56.799 --> 00:35:58.890
it probably be blue rather than orange.

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:02.569
&gt;&gt; NURIK: Yeah, that's just for [INDISTINCT]
just to exenterate but you can still theme,

00:36:02.569 --> 00:36:03.569
right?

00:36:03.569 --> 00:36:04.569
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Of course.

00:36:04.569 --> 00:36:07.800
&gt;&gt; NURIK: I mean the original app has awesome
themes, you know, green, blue, pink, orange,

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.383
which is really awesome and great way to customize,
really simple way to customize.

00:36:10.383 --> 00:36:12.950
And so you can do the same thing with Holo.

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:22.839
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I would love to see your take
Roman on the--a redesign of the skeuomorphic

00:36:22.839 --> 00:36:27.599
design to be more in line with the navigation
that you're talking about, because I completely

00:36:27.599 --> 00:36:29.539
agree with your analysis in navigation.

00:36:29.539 --> 00:36:30.539
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:36:30.539 --> 00:36:34.809
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I also think that, you know,
looking--of course, we're looking at the initial

00:36:34.809 --> 00:36:39.009
screen on the left here and then on the right,
we're looking at, that's the laps right?

00:36:39.009 --> 00:36:40.009
&gt;&gt; NURIK: Uh-hmm.

00:36:40.009 --> 00:36:46.141
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And I greatly prefer Roman's
redesign of that screen.

00:36:46.141 --> 00:36:52.190
I felt like the original screen had too much
information compacted into small in area and

00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:56.480
you know that one of my bad peeves is repeat
gradient designs on the list.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.480
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Repeating gradients.

00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And I feel like that.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:36:59.480
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It sums a lot.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.520
That ship has sailed.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:07.860
I feel the same way about the gradients on
the top of the left-hand screen, you know,

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:12.339
the timer--this sort of like, you know, pipe
effect.

00:37:12.339 --> 00:37:13.349
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:15.380
Yeah, it's the pipe.

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:21.190
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I think it's--it feel--it feels--it
feels a little old, it feels less designed

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:24.140
than the main clock which looks amazing.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:25.140
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:30.049
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It uses gradients to give a very
realistic lighting effect on what looks like

00:37:30.049 --> 00:37:32.450
a beautiful, you know, time piece.

00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:33.450
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, absolutely.

00:37:33.450 --> 00:37:35.999
I would love a stop watch which looks like
that and now I can have one.

00:37:35.999 --> 00:37:36.999
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: There you go.

00:37:36.999 --> 00:37:38.990
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, so I think, you know, from
my perspective.

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:43.020
I kind of like to see--like I agree again,
with the navigation, I think it much simpler.

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:46.890
The discoverability of the stopwatch and timer
in the laps and so on from the original design

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:49.390
is suboptimum, I think.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:54.099
But having that beautiful skeuomorphic design
placed inside of the container that Roman

00:37:54.099 --> 00:37:57.910
suggested, I think it would be a really nice
sort of compromise.

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:03.920
So, you know, what do you think Javier and,
you know, is--does the--does the navigational

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.569
alternative that Roman suggested sort of make
sense to you?

00:38:06.569 --> 00:38:09.930
Is it a direction that, you know, think may
want ahead or you're just really happy with

00:38:09.930 --> 00:38:13.190
the way that the app works now and think we
should just shut up?

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:20.410
&gt;&gt; Just go and give Javier a little bit of
time to respond.

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:21.410
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:22.410
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Sure.

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:23.410
We'll wait.

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:24.410
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You should dance.

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:25.819
Roman?

00:38:25.819 --> 00:38:33.829
There you go.

00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:38.320
&gt;&gt; So Roman, why don't you go ahead and read
for him if you want.

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.560
&gt;&gt; NURIK: Yeah, sure, sure.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:43.355
So [INDISTINCT] I think it looks great, I
like the Holo Android style and colors, the

00:38:43.355 --> 00:38:48.670
current time and lap are easier to read and
understand with the change of color and topography.

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:52.420
The lap list main theme is the same looking
field, the analog view and the addition of

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:56.200
red and green values to show the slowest and
fastest laps is a nice touch.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:00.650
Yeah, so definitely some of the elements can
kind of be merged in for sure.

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:02.030
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very cool, yeah.

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:04.869
I mean, I think this is--this is an app that
really looks great.

00:39:04.869 --> 00:39:09.869
That does the basics really, really well and
I mean, it just go such a stunning look.

00:39:09.869 --> 00:39:10.869
And the way [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And it really does andů

00:39:10.869 --> 00:39:11.869
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ůand I like it, it's just incredible.

00:39:11.869 --> 00:39:16.359
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And remember too, you know, a
lot of people joke about skeuomorphism, but

00:39:16.359 --> 00:39:23.380
usually the objections are that it doesn't
add anything or that it actually makes thins

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:27.922
uglier, that makes things confusing or that's
presenting an interface that people that may

00:39:27.922 --> 00:39:34.299
not be even familiar with because they haven't
grown up using the original equipment that

00:39:34.299 --> 00:39:35.640
the skeuomorphism is based on.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.640
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Indeed.

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.079
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: None of those applied here.

00:39:38.079 --> 00:39:42.880
I think that--like you said, I mean, this
is something that I'm really happy looking

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:43.880
at.

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:50.510
So I would love to explore more of how to
that sort of think but maintain all of the

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:57.920
Android navigation cues and UI cues that we're
used to in other apps.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:03.440
Yeah, in general, I think it's really interesting
to look at both styles together and see how

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.430
you can accomplish this same thing in different
ways.

00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:06.430
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:10.109
I think this actually brings up a really good
point that we sort of allude to during the

00:40:10.109 --> 00:40:14.359
App Clinic quite often which is, if you're
going to do something that looks the same,

00:40:14.359 --> 00:40:15.490
it should work the same.

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:20.210
But you can do something totally different
and as long as it looks good, that's sweet.

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:22.230
And so I think that's we're talking about
with this app.

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:26.280
Where the actual timer itself, you know, all
of this stuff here looks fantastic, it--and

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:27.280
it's intuitive.

00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:32.589
And we've been working on clock design for
a fair number of years.

00:40:32.589 --> 00:40:35.660
So it is something that people can intuit
pretty well.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:37.380
That's kind of why it looks that way.

00:40:37.380 --> 00:40:41.730
The things like navigation, you know, that's
going to be--should be consistent between

00:40:41.730 --> 00:40:42.730
apps.

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:45.460
You know, you want to be able to flip between
apps and be able to navigate and find and

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:47.470
discover things, really easily.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:51.430
And so that's kind of the sort of direction
you want to take when you're building an app

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:56.480
is try and keep the standard things which
are going to be the same as with a bunch of

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:59.750
other apps should be able to be accessed and
work the same.

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:01.859
And then things which are unique to your app,
make them unique, make them beautiful.

00:41:01.859 --> 00:41:04.780
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'm going to make just one last
comment.

00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:09.200
And that's that when I hit the set button,
think this is what I was most disappointed

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:15.029
with, is that we have a--so first off, this
is a less usable interface then a current

00:41:15.029 --> 00:41:17.339
spinner based interface.

00:41:17.339 --> 00:41:23.510
But also, the thing that kind of made me sad
was we have some really beautifully designed

00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:29.690
buttons but then we also have this which is,
you know, beautiful in it's own way but during

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:30.690
next these.

00:41:30.690 --> 00:41:31.690
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, right.

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:36.559
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And then these stock buttons
that I wish would just go away forever.

00:41:36.559 --> 00:41:41.859
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So in case you guys can't see, but
we've actually got the set timer dialog up.

00:41:41.859 --> 00:41:44.839
Which, yeah, it's unfortunate.

00:41:44.839 --> 00:41:49.240
It's kind of being customized in a way that
probably made it look better on Gingerbread

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:54.710
or Frio or whatever device that you built
it on originally, but now on a--on a Jellybean

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:58.079
device, it looks a little faded, really.

00:41:58.079 --> 00:42:01.839
So this is one example where the dialog could
probably stock to the defaults and you'd have

00:42:01.839 --> 00:42:02.900
a better looking app now.

00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:09.260
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, I think the general rule
is that if you're going to use a custom look

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:15.819
and feel, make sure that you use that all
the way throughout whatever view you're modifying.

00:42:15.819 --> 00:42:23.270
Because if you incorporate stock elements
into a custom look and feel, then if the stock

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:26.900
elements ever change, which of course they
do because a lot of times manufacturers will

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.369
put on their own elements et cetera.

00:42:29.369 --> 00:42:32.939
Then, you'll be stuck with elements that look
out of place [INDISTINCT]

00:42:32.939 --> 00:42:37.490
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Cool, weů
&gt;&gt; NURIK: Javier just mentioned that he agrees

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:40.260
and he does want to change the time ticker.

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:41.260
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Also that's great.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:43.569
I mean, we're looking--we're going to keep
an eye on this on Javier.

00:42:43.569 --> 00:42:45.619
I think this is an app which looks great.

00:42:45.619 --> 00:42:50.029
Has a, you know, a huge amount of potential
for something which is already really good.

00:42:50.029 --> 00:42:54.839
So congratulations, thank you for coming on
and giving us your feedback as well and, yeah,

00:42:54.839 --> 00:42:56.329
keep up the great work.

00:42:56.329 --> 00:42:59.190
We look forward to seeing where this app ends
up.

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:00.190
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:01.190
Thanks a lot for joining us Javier.

00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:02.310
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:05.660
We're out of time because we thought this
would take us a half an hour and it didn't.

00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:06.660
It'sů
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: No, no.

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ůtaken us 45 and we've rushed.

00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.390
So maybe now or next week, I'm not sure.

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:12.589
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Let's see--let's see what the
viewers think.

00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:13.949
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Let's see, yeah, so let us know.

00:43:13.949 --> 00:43:16.980
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Let's see if that hater comes
back from last week.

00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:19.960
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Well, there are some people who
don't like fun and I fear that we may have

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.019
been smiling too much, so that could be a
problem.

00:43:22.019 --> 00:43:23.019
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's possible.

00:43:23.019 --> 00:43:26.329
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But we do like to hear your feedback
and anything we can do differently, better;

00:43:26.329 --> 00:43:30.230
longer show, shorter show; less of us, more
of someone else.

00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:34.609
Do let us know, we'll try and take that into
account.

00:43:34.609 --> 00:43:36.819
Quick heads up because we do like advertise
our own stuff.

00:43:36.819 --> 00:43:38.600
This is something we've learn from watching
TV.

00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:39.600
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:42.400
&gt;&gt; MEIER: On Friday, we have The App Clinic
once again me and Ian.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.900
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Wait you got to do it the TV
way then.

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:50.410
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Goů
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Coming up next, Next week on

00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:51.410
Android Developer live.

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:52.410
Go ahead.

00:43:52.410 --> 00:43:53.410
&gt;&gt; MEIER: There's reason why we're not on
TV.

00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:56.200
So we'll be up on Friday as usual, but not
as usual, it will be on at a different time.

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.609
So that's 10:30 in the AM.

00:43:58.609 --> 00:44:01.170
That's Pacific Time, which is UTC minus seven.

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:04.819
We're going to try a little early because
we found a lot of--a lot of you guys are watching

00:44:04.819 --> 00:44:07.900
us from Europe and this means you don't have
to stay up past midnight.

00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:12.260
And may be that our audience is entirely made
of European insomniacs, in which case we are

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:14.730
really shooting ourselves in the foot here.

00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:18.119
But we hope that this means more of you can
watch and take part.

00:44:18.119 --> 00:44:21.950
We're going to do cameras and photography
apps, we've got a bunch of suggestions in

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:22.950
the moderator.

00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:26.490
We're probably going go out of this broadcast
and start picking the apps.

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:29.911
So if you want to make a suggestion or vote
on the ones that are there, now is the time

00:44:29.911 --> 00:44:34.140
to do it and we'll let you guys know exactly
who we're going to look at tomorrow later

00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:35.140
today.

00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:37.600
That's pretty much it from us.

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:38.790
We should take of.

00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:39.790
Thanks for watching.

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:40.940
Again, let us know what you think.

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:44.880
We're going to--we plan to do the show weekly
to give all the developers a chance to let

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:48.520
us know what they think about what they told
them about their apps.

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.769
So do tune in and let us know what we can
do differently.

00:44:50.769 --> 00:44:51.769
My name is Reto.

00:44:51.769 --> 00:44:54.400
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And if you're watching and you
are a developer, make sure that you leave

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.799
your contact information for us so weů
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely, yeah.

00:44:56.799 --> 00:44:57.799
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ůget in touch with you.

00:44:57.799 --> 00:45:01.190
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's how we found all the guys
this week because they all commented in the

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:02.190
event stream.

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:03.309
So I was able to find them more easily.

00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:04.309
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:05.309
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So let us know who you are.

00:45:05.309 --> 00:45:07.180
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Any way, you were--you wereů
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I was doing a [INDISTINCT] Yeah.

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.180
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's right.

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.180
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So I'm Reto.

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:10.180
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'm Ian.

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.900
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And thank you very much for watching
and we'll see you tomorrow.

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:12.960
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Take care.
