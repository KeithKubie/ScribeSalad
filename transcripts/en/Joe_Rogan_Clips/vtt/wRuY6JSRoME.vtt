1
00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.410
I,
yeah,
I,
uh,
I got caught smoking weed at universities.

2
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.410
I had my girl bring my kid away and I was outside of the Jurassic Park.

3
00:00:07.411 --> 00:00:08.970
I didn't get caught by the police,

4
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.240
but I was outside of the Jurassic Park ride and I was like,
all right,
you know,

5
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:13.800
bring him to go get a soda or whatever.

6
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.310
I'm going to sit here and smoke my vape pen.
And a,

7
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.640
there's like one of the handlers,

8
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.760
they have a thing where they have a velociraptors like a person in a costume,

9
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:22.000
but it's again,
I'm gonna try to costume.
Yeah.

10
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.590
And they're pretending to be like a velociraptor and the uh,

11
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.560
the trainers like trying to calm them down and it's a whole display with the

12
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:31.050
kids and everyone's really excited.
So I'm just kind of watching it,

13
00:00:31.051 --> 00:00:35.370
like getting stoned zoning out.
And at one point the girls got like one of those,

14
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.170
you know,
a microphone face pieces on.
She just goes,
she goes,
sir,

15
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.880
not here.
And that was it.
And I went up and then I just,
sir,
not here,

16
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.150
faded off into this.
I know.
I wonder if they're cooler about it now.

17
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.620
Now this is a year ago.
Oh,
there's not that long ago.
Wow.
I was very surprised.

18
00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:54.000
I was like,
this is California.

19
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.440
<v 1>What would it,</v>

20
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.670
what if it was a vape pen with tobacco or CBD or are you allowed to do that?

21
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.060
Probably not.
I think there's smoking areas that are designated,

22
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.490
but she knew what it was.
She saw my face.
I was,

23
00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.800
my mouth was agape watching real velociraptors walking around.

24
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:15.360
I was losing my mind.
It was all us to like get outta here.
Stoner.
Yeah.

25
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.320
That was listening to the radio and Utah and they were talking about how they

26
00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:21.510
have to,
uh,
re uh,

27
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.510
they have to figure out what to do with their drug sniffing dogs now,

28
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.530
cause there's no reason for that.
Is there a change in Utah?

29
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:31.380
Is Utah changing their,
uh,
their drug policy?

30
00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.370
Because it was funny this listening to this old dude on,
just for the,

31
00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:36.210
for the fuck of it.

32
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:41.040
I was listen to am radio talk radio and this old dude was talking about how they

33
00:01:41.041 --> 00:01:41.601
uh,
they're,

34
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:45.030
they're going to decommission some of these drug sniffing dogs cause they'd use

35
00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:47.250
them on like traffic stops.
There we go.

36
00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.720
Medical Marijuana in Utah could mean retirement for generation of drug canines.

37
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.160
Just fucking putting these dogs down.

38
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.140
Well they also were worried about the police officers themselves losing jobs

39
00:01:58.141 --> 00:01:58.231
here.

40
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:03.231
Like when you hear about pot that's making its way into a place like Utah,

41
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.740
you know,
first of all you realize God damn pod is really,
you can't stop.

42
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.780
It's here.
The genie's out of the bottle.
The revenues in grandma feels better.

43
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.310
You know,
the Alzheimer's,

44
00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.760
the people that have all these serious issues that CBD is fixing,

45
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.080
arthritis patients,

46
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.400
people with like real problems that are not finding any other solution that

47
00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:24.930
works the way cannabis does.

48
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.210
They're just giving in and then they're making all this money.

49
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.840
But then you see these old folks that are from a different time and they're

50
00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:32.350
talking about it and they,

51
00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:36.000
they look at it in terms of like how many police jobs are going to go away.

52
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.800
How many dogs are going to be decommissioned lead.
So it's not really my problem.

53
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.710
Interesting to watch them look at it as an economic issue.

54
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.270
<v 0>The problem is you have pot heads that are leading the charge.</v>

55
00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:49.890
So it's for a long time it was difficult to take him serious.
Yeah.

56
00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.410
You still needed,
you needed straightly skies to come in and you know,

57
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.191
there's a lot of money there.

58
00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:56.080
There's so much money in it that you're getting that,

59
00:02:56.081 --> 00:03:00.610
but when you have fucking hippies playing hacky sack and yeah.
You know,

60
00:03:00.611 --> 00:03:01.750
weren't Pooka shell necklaces,

61
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:04.870
this sort of hard to take them seriously when the reality is they kind of want

62
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:08.860
it to be legalized for recreational purposes and you know,

63
00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.580
yeah.
I don't know.
Like for,
I don't,
I don't use,
we assess doesn't try to do,

64
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:14.680
I do take CBD.
I literally,

65
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.370
during that fight I was using topical CBD the whole time.
Um,

66
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.110
so I guess I do,
I take CBD excellent daily,

67
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:27.910
but I don't know of infamous EBT sponsors or our podcasts and the festivals,

68
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.580
whether also I'll get you a bunch of products because they're a really great

69
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:32.400
company that supports comedy.
They,

70
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.470
they sponsored my tour when I was preparing for my special,
they're fucking dope.

71
00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.150
But,
um,
I take it daily.
I take the,
the oil,
um,

72
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.080
just because you know,
apparently all of the,

73
00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:46.900
the benefits that it has with getting your body back into homeostasis and making

74
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:49.960
you feel better and getting back in line.
I don't know the fucking effects.

75
00:03:49.961 --> 00:03:52.630
I smoke weed every day as well,
so I'm sure I'm getting CBD affects as well.

76
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.480
But in my mind I'm going,
well,
I have a bunch of this stuff.

77
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.740
I know that since I started taking it,
I weirdly feel better,

78
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.910
but I can't really connect.

79
00:04:00.911 --> 00:04:04.840
You said before you take CBD and you go into another realm?
Well,

80
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:09.820
I was taking one and one.
It's like one gram of CBD to one gram of,
of THC.

81
00:04:09.821 --> 00:04:13.510
Like it's a,
it's one part.
So whatever milligrams you have,

82
00:04:13.511 --> 00:04:17.950
it's like 10 milligrams CBD.
It's 10 milligrams weed as well.
It's potent.

83
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.180
Yeah.
I take regular CBD too though.
I take oil,
I feel like it's a,

84
00:04:22.181 --> 00:04:26.260
it's very beneficial and much more potent in terms of its anti-inflammatory

85
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:29.740
benefits than just smoking it.
Smoking it does something for you.

86
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:34.140
It definitely reduces inflammation,
makes you feel better.
Take sore joints.

87
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:36.540
A topical.
I was using topicals good too.
Yeah,

88
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.600
but I think the real combination is topical plus the oil.

89
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.610
You don't have to take it,
but people,

90
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:46.590
a lot of people find that they have better pain relief from one verse,

91
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.310
one plus one like one part THC,
one part.
So it's like edible,

92
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.430
like you know,
marijuana mixed with CBD.

93
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:56.170
A lot of people find great benefit in that.

94
00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:58.240
For some reason I had to trick my aunt because my aunt,

95
00:04:58.241 --> 00:05:03.241
so anti-drugs and if I told her that CBD was derived from Hampshire,

96
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.960
she wouldn't take him.
She goes better arthritis.
And I gave it to her for,
uh,

97
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.370
for that and she loves it.
And then I told her after the fact,

98
00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.230
but it's grabbing dude.
It's just a plant folks.
And if you just get straight CBD,

99
00:05:14.231 --> 00:05:16.970
it has no psychoactive properties.
There's no,
it's not going to.

100
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.110
The only thing that's going to do is for some folks and it works a little bit

101
00:05:20.111 --> 00:05:24.060
less weight with me.
It alleviate some anxiety and just relaxes you.
Yeah.

102
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.740
Yeah.
That's uh,
that's why I smoke weed too.
Yeah.
I smile.

103
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.330
I've been arrested probably 10 times in my life and every time was for smoking a

104
00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:39.820
joint in the street every single time.
Do they arrest you?
Did they take you in?

105
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.590
Yeah.
New York Targhee still fucking sell.
It's crazy.

106
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:45.820
It's still,
they're still doing,

107
00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:50.350
the last time I was put into a cell for smoking weed was a year and a half ago.

108
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.640
Me and Dave Smith two years ago,
maybe me and just tell them you were Louis J.

109
00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.630
Gomez.
I told him,
go to my eyes.
That's when I started in the middle initial.

110
00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.360
I was like,
you know what his problem,
I learned a lesson.

111
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.600
I went fucking Louis Gomez as much have rap sheets doggy.

112
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.730
Every time I come back into the country I am pulled into a room and they
fucking,

113
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.420
they look like they're about to fuck me with a rubber glove every time.

114
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.090
Have you been to Panama City ton recently,
sir?

115
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.030
Come right this way.
Every single time.
Time of Bolivia sir.
But yeah,
dude,

116
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:24.500
when in New York City,
the way it works is you did,
it sucks.
Oh,

117
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:25.251
it's happened so many times.

118
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:27.350
It's the worst cause it's just a major inconvenience.

119
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.210
Pain in the ass to get into Canada.

120
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.920
I can do it now because they changed the laws,

121
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.250
but I didn't go to Canada for like three years because of weed for being

122
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:35.990
arrested for a joint.

123
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.720
We're not talking about like I have announced that I just bought from my dealer

124
00:06:38.721 --> 00:06:42.410
and they found a large amount on me,
a joint smoking on the street.

125
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.890
What they do is they,
they at first they,

126
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.640
they take the weed and they go,
all right,
we're just gonna give you a ticket.

127
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.220
Just hang tight,
relax.
We're going to put cuffs on you.

128
00:06:52.221 --> 00:06:54.920
This is just to keep you calm and just to fucking get you in the patty wagon.

129
00:06:54.921 --> 00:06:57.530
It's all a process.
And then they put you in a paddy wagon.

130
00:06:57.531 --> 00:07:01.880
They used to have sweet nights in New York where all it was was they would go

131
00:07:01.881 --> 00:07:05.390
and try to find kids smoking weed kit,
drunk kids,
college kids,

132
00:07:05.391 --> 00:07:07.400
pissing in public public intoxication.

133
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.580
And the entire night they would just pick up everybody in Phillip,

134
00:07:10.581 --> 00:07:15.470
patty wagons and create criminals.
Just create criminals that have teenagers,

135
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.101
you know,
kit.

136
00:07:16.101 --> 00:07:18.770
And they were targeting this why the stop and frisk laws has happened in New

137
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:22.100
York.
They changed it because they were just targeting black and Hispanic kids.

138
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.290
Mm.
