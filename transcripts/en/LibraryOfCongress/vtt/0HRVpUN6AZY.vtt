00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.340
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.670
And thank you for
joining us today

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.870
for our Books and
Beyond Program.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.690
I'm Guy Lamolinara from
the Center for the Book

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.520
and the Center for the Book is
co-sponsoring this talk today.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.360
We're the division of the
Library that promotes books,

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.190
reading libraries and literacy,
and we also administer here

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.770
at the Library the Young
Readers Center and the Poetry

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.520
and Literature Center which are
over in the Jefferson Building.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.760
Our mission is carried
out nationwide.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.940
We do that here through
the National Center,

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.700
but we also have a State
Center in every state and D.C.,

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.960
and we also have one in
the U.S. Virgin Islands,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.490
and we also have a partnership

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.680
of 80 like-minded literacy
organizations that we work with.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.550
Additionally, we play
an important role

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.530
in the National Book Festival

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.470
and this year's Festival
is Saturday, September 24th

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.190
at the Washington
Convention Center.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.270
And if you've never been to
the National Book Festival,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.440
I urge you to come because
it's a wonderful event.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.760
It's a great way to meet
your favorite authors.

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.060
And you could find out more

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.210
about the Book Festival
at loc.gov/bookfest.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.510
Before we get started,

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.140
I just ask that you please turn
off all your electronic devices,

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.030
and I need to tell you that
we're recording today so that,

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.880
so if you ask a question you
will become part of our webcast.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.960
And we also have
C-SPAN here today,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.660
so you'll be part
of theirs as well.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.440
You can view our webcast at
the Center for the Book website

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.020
which is read.gov, and
there you'll find more

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.940
than 250 book discussions that
we've had over many years.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.810
Today's author's book will be

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.790
for sale just outside the
entrance to this room,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.080
and following her presentation
she will be signing the book.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.150
And it's also a chance
for you to talk

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.550
to her further about her work.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.680
The chief criterion we have for
deciding which books we feature

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.190
in our series is that the writer
must have used the Library

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.780
of Congress, and in this case,
of course, that is obvious

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.110
with our Jacob Riis Collection.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.150
This program is presented,
in fact, in conjunction

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.140
with the exhibition created

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.100
by the Interpretive Programs
Office here at the Library.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.620
And this is the brochure
where you will find

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.690
out more information about
this great exhibition which is

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.670
over in the Jefferson Building.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.900
The exhibition is
called Jacob Riis,

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.220
Revealing How the
Other Half Lives,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.210
and it's a co-presentation
of the Library and Museum

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.950
of the City of New York.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.070
And it's on display
in Jefferson Building

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.820
through September 5, 2016.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.560
The exhibition and its
programming were made possible

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.860
by generous donors listed on the
back of this exhibition brochure

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.150
which you can find at
the exit to this event.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.970
Today's program is co-sponsored

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.800
with the Interpretive Programs
Office, and thank you very much

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.990
for bringing that
program with us today.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.630
Also with us is someone from the
Publishing Office who has worked

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.760
on the book, the beautiful book
that accompanies the exhibition,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.600
and that is Aimee Hess
who is a writer/editor

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.990
in the Publishing Office where
she has worked since 2003.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.750
Aimee has written two books
while there, <i>Women Who Dare,</i>

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.310
<i>Helen Keller </i>and <i>Women
Who Dare, Margaret Mead </i>.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.830
And as an editor, Aimee
has worked on scores

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.530
of books relating to the Library
of Congress' vast collections

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.660
on topics ranging from
the Renaissance mapmaking

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.960
to our collections

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.850
of photographs documenting
Depression-era America.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.960
In recent years, Aimee has
pioneered the Library's Digital

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.550
Publishing Program with the
2013 e-books, <i>Great Photographs</i>

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.580
<i>from the Library of
Congress </i>and <i>Michigan-I-O,</i>

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.820
<i>Allan Lomax in the 1938 Library</i>

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.140
<i>of Congress Folklife
Exhibition </i>.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.730
She is currently editing the
forthcoming book, an e-book,

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.230
<i>Homeplace </i>which will highlight
the Michael Ford Collection

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.270
in the American Folklife Center.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.510
Please welcome Aimee Hess.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.370
[ Applause ]

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.670
&gt;&gt; Aimee Hess: Okay.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.240
Thank you, everybody.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.350
I'm here to introduce
Bonnie Yochelson

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.250
with whom I was lucky enough
to work on the Jacob Riis book,

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.630
<i>Jacob A. Riis, Revealing
How the Other Half Lives </i>.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.020
Bonnie is originally
from the D.C. area,

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.350
but she's made her long-time
home in New York City.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.240
She graduated from
Swarthmore College

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.640
and then proceeded a Master's
and a Doctorate in Art History

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:41.720
from New York University.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.160
Early in her career, she
was back in D.C. working

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.000
in the print room at the
National Gallery of Art.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.570
And from 1987 to 1991 she
was the Curator of Prints

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.680
and Photographs at the Museum
of the City of New York.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.280
And that's where she
was first able to work

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.310
with the Jacob Riis
collection of photographs.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.650
Since leaving the Museum, she's
been an independent Curator

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.250
and Photographic Historian
working with such institutions

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.390
as the New York Historical
Society,

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.750
the Columbia County
Historical Society,

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.600
and the South Street
Seaport Museum.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.550
And since 1988, she has also
taught in the MFA Program

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.120
in the Department
of Photography,

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.730
Video and Related Media at
the School of Visual Arts

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.860
in New York where she curates
the annual Thesis Show,

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.640
and serves as a mentor
to graduating students.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.690
In addition to the Thesis Show,

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.050
Bonnie has curated
numerous exhibitions,

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.960
including Esther Bubley,
American Photojournalist,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.710
at the UBS Paine Webber Art
Gallery in New York in 2001.

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.830
That also travelled
to other cities.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.020
And an exhibition titled
Alfred Stieglitz New York

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.570
at the South Street
Seaport Museum in 2010.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.640
And, of course, she curated our
current Jacob A. Riis Exhibition

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.890
along with Barbara Thayer in our
Manuscript Division which opened

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.440
in a related but different
format at the Museum of the City

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.460
of New York before
opening here in April.

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.960
And it will also travel to
two locations in Denmark.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.300
Bonnie is also the author

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.900
of many books including
<i>Berniece Abbott,</i>

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.910
<i>Changing New York, Alfred
Stieglitz New York </i>,

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.840
and a co-author with
Daniel Czitrom

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.320
of <i>Rediscovering Jacob Riis </i>.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.820
She's also written books on
the Clarence H. White School

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.740
of Photography and Esther
Bubbly among other subjects.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.840
And, of course, Bonnie
also wrote the book

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.340
that we are all here for
today, <i>Jacob A. Riis,</i>

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.410
<i>Revealing New York's
Other Half </i>.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:36.380
When Bonnie first began
working on Riis more

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.340
than two decades ago, Riis
was remembered primarily

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.780
as a photographer, and her
subsequent scholarship has

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.900
provided a much fuller
picture of Riis as an immigrant

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.050
who pulled himself up by his
bootstraps, a journalist,

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.600
an author, and a social reformer

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.980
who considered photographs
nothing more than a tool

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:56.320
to spread his message.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.510
By seeing this fuller
picture of Riis

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:01.090
and by reading his
articles, books, lectures,

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.140
and the personal papers that
are housed here at the Library,

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.870
we can better understand
the issues

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.290
that New York's other
half actually faced --

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.160
poverty, poor housing
conditions, child labor,

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.660
lack of access to education,
homelessness, and disease.

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.910
Most, if not all of these
issues are still with us today

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.970
in one form or another,
which makes Riis's work

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.830
and Bonnie's more
relevant than ever.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.880
As an editor, I have worked
with a lot of different authors,

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.720
and since I have the
stage I just want

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.560
to take this opportunity to say
what an absolute pleasure it was

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.910
to work with Bonnie and how
much I admire her as a scholar

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:40.930
and an independent -- and
a museum professional.

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.780
It takes a certain kind
of person to be successful

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.460
as an independent scholar,

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.960
someone who can manager her
own time, meet deadlines,

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.740
forge connections and
partnerships, and find money

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.040
to get big projects done.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.280
While I was spending much of
my time on this one project,

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.350
she was simultaneously
conducting original research,

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.870
writing unique exhibition lists
for different venues, teaching

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:08.380
and coordinating the Senior
Thesis Show at the School

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.980
of Visual Arts, all
while writing this book

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.580
and compiling the first-ever
catalog of Riis's photographs.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:17.960
In the years it has taken to
get these exhibitions mounted

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.430
and this book published, Bonnie
has worn every single type

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.710
of hat in the business, and none
of this could have been possible

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.570
without her talent, energy,
and passion for her subject.

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:31.510
So, with that, I will let
Bonnie take the stage.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:38.200
[ Applause ]

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.650
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Yochelson:
Aimee, thank you so much.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.950
I'm moved.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:43.460
Thank you very much.

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:46.380
Welcome everyone.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:52.570
Okay. So I'm going
to read pretty much,

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.250
and let's see what
we have to say here.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:59.150
I'm going to repeat a
little bit of what Aimee did

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:03.620
to just make sure that we
understand how these different

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.220
parts of this project
fit together.

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:09.700
The Jacob Riis Exhibition now on
view in the Jefferson Building

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.450
of the Library of Congress is
the result of a collaboration

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:15.220
of the past several years
between the Library and Museum

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.650
of the City of New York.

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.940
The Museum's own -- owns
the Riis's photographs

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.360
of New York City's slums
in the late 19th century.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.850
These photographs are
the earliest evidence

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:29.430
of the disastrous effects of the
forces of modernity on New York,

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:33.110
whose slums were the worst
on Earth at that time.

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:35.590
Because the city's economy
was expanding so rapidly,

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:38.420
it became a magnet
for rural Americans

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.520
and European immigrants
seeking jobs and a better life.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.460
And although jobs
were plentiful,

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.750
the city did not have
the housing, sanitation,

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.910
or transportation system
to meet their basic needs.

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:51.520
New arrivals lived in
hastily-built tenements

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.410
with little or no
plumbing, and wages

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:55.390
and rents were exploitative.

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:57.850
People of all ages,
including young children,

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.920
worked in factories and did
piecework in their homes.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.420
Education was not mandatory
and there were no public parks

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.310
or playgrounds where
children could play safely.

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:11.540
Riis's photographs, taken
between 1887 and 1895,

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.970
depicted all these urban ills.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:15.270
The collection is small.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:19.430
Riis only took about 250
pictures of New York.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.780
But it is unique, world
famous, and in constant demand.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:25.950
So just as a kind
of signature image,

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.670
I'm showing you Bandit's Roost

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.540
which is Riis's most
famous picture.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.340
It shows some Italian
toughs in an alley

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.150
in a neighborhood
called Mulberry Bend

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.360
which he wrote much about

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.200
and which was very
close to his office.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.710
Let's see if I can get
this going properly.

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:48.860
And just to show you
the sort of sense

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:54.020
in which Riis's images have
been thoroughly disseminated,

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:57.110
this is -- shows a
recreation of Bandit's Roost

00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:02.950
by Martin Scorsese in his 2002
film, <i>Gangs of New York </i>.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.580
Riis is equally celebrated
for his first book,

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:09.040
<i>How the Other Half Lives </i>which
presented a passionate argument

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:10.340
for addressing this crisis.

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.570
Riis was a journalist by
trade, and after years

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.590
of covering the crime beat in
New York, he began to write

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:20.040
about urban poverty and the
latest ideas to remedy it.

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.480
His book has remained in print
since it first appeared in 1890,

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:28.170
and it's become a landmark
text in American history.

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:32.020
This is -- shows you the
first edition of the book.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.350
It's very small.

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:34.650
I don't know.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:39.070
I should know this right
now, like 5 by 9 inches.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:41.960
And this shows you
a recent edition.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.090
You can see how it's --

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.780
you know, it's even
called out on the cover,

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.520
"A Jacob Riis Classic."

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.900
Interestingly, a photograph

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.000
on the front is not
by Riis [laughter].

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.680
But it's in the picture
of tenements.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.790
The Library of Congress owns
the bulk or Riis's archive

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:03.520
which includes notes,
manuscripts,

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.930
off-prints of articles,
annotated scrapbooks

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:07.890
of newspaper clippings,
family letters,

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.190
expense books, and much more.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:15.650
And just again, to give you some
idea, this is the first page

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:20.410
of a small scrapbook in which
Riis collected the press

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:23.850
comments on his very
first lecture.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:27.850
It reads here, "Press comments
on the lecture, "The Other Half,

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.360
How It Lives and Dies in
New York," illustrated

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.710
with a hundred photographic
views by Jacob A. Riis,

00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:37.010
delivered for the first
time, January 25, 1888,

00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:39.150
before the American
Photographers Association

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.100
at 122 W. 36th Street,
New York."

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:47.870
So, this gives you a
sense of how aware he was

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:54.430
of keeping track of his
career for posterity.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.950
The current exhibition, which
opened last fall in New York,

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:00.810
as Aimee said, and will
travel this fall to Denmark,

00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:02.910
which is Riis's native country,

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:04.920
brings together the
Museum's photographs

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.660
and the Library's archive
for the very first time.

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:10.220
In each venue the show
takes a different form,

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:14.540
but each offers a rich
portrait of Riis and his legacy.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.190
I first encountered
Riis's photographs in 1987

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.630
when I took a job as Curator
of Prints and Photographs

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.790
at the Museum of the
City of New York.

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:24.720
Riis was a professional
journalist,

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.360
not a professional
photographer, indeed,

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.000
not even a serious
amateur photographer.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.260
Yet he is considered one
of the great pioneers

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:33.770
in the history of the medium.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:36.250
This is the puzzle that has
kept me working on Riis on

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.440
and off for, I have to
say, nearly 30 years.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.960
Just a shocking thought.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.290
But now, finally, I am done.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:47.400
Today I would like to share
with you my journey with Riis

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:49.810
and summarize my understanding
of his accomplishments

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:52.050
as a reformer and
a photographer.

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:55.130
Before becoming Curator
at the Museum I worked

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:58.410
in the Photography Departments
of three art museums.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:01.490
These museums collected
individual prints

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:05.440
by photographers who used the
camera to create works of art.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.440
The Riis collection was
unlike any I had ever seen.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.860
It consisted of 415
glass negatives,

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:15.500
many of them copy negatives of
prints by other photographers,

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:20.430
326 glass lantern slides made by
commercial photography studios,

00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:24.790
and 191 vintage prints, a
handful from Riis's negatives,

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.150
and the remainder by unknown
professional photographers.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:31.570
The museum was the sole
repository of Riis's photographs

00:14:31.570 --> 00:14:34.780
which consisted of this
assortment of odd stuff.

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:37.470
The record search at
the museum indicated

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:40.390
that the collection
came there in 1945,

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.290
31 years after Riis
died, and was given

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.560
by his son, Roger William Riis.

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.240
The story behind this gift
only created more questions.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.920
In the 1940s, photographer
Alexander Alland [assumed

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.760
spelling], Senior had
noticed that the title page

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.950
of <i>How the Other
Half Lives </i>announced

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.990
that the book's illustrations
were based

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.340
on photographs by the author.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:06.020
Searching for these photographs,
Alland contacted Riis's son

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.780
and convinced him to ask the
current owners of the house

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:11.640
in Queens where he grew up
if he might look in the attic

00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:13.670
for his father's photographs.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:17.550
There he found a box which
contained the 450 negatives,

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:21.220
326 lantern slides,
and 191 vintage prints

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.010
that now comprise
the Riis collection.

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:26.800
The very fact that Riis did not
save his photographs is the most

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:29.210
important clue to what
he thought of them.

00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.670
In contrast to the photographs,
Riis organized, annotated all

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:34.790
of his papers for posterity.

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:37.340
His family eventually gave
most of them to the Library

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.230
of Congress and a
smaller portion

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.180
to the New York Public Library.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.600
When Riis sold the family home
and moved to Massachusetts

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:48.080
in 1912, he left the
photographs in the attic.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:51.030
The contents of the box in the
attic was given to the Museum

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:53.070
of the City of New York
because Alland teamed

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:56.680
up with the curator at the time,
Grace Mayor, who prepared --

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.590
and together they
prepared an exhibition,

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.910
"The Battle of the Slum" which,

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:04.960
in 1947 introduced Riis's
photographs to the world.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:10.410
The show featured 50
beautiful prints made by Alland

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:13.510
from Riis's negatives
with quotations culled

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.980
by Mayor from Riis's writings.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:19.300
This comparison of an
Alland print on the left

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.550
and the contact print
from Riis's negatives --

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.560
the contact print
from this negative

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:30.770
in the Riis collection gives you
some idea of Alland's artistry.

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:33.050
Alland doubled the size
of the vintage prints,

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.170
which you cannot really see
here because I'm just fooling

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.900
around with, you
know, reproductions

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:42.540
on this -- in the PowerPoint.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:46.040
But which you can
see is get some sense

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:51.050
of his darkroom wizardry in
which Alland created rich blacks

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.910
and detailed highlights.

00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:55.610
He also cropped out the
foreground of the image,

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:58.380
eliminating the areas
that were out of focus

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.140
which brought our
attention to the ragpickers

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.070
in the middle distance.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:04.990
Let's see if I can
show you this.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:08.750
He cropped out this basically
out-of-focus foreground so that

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:12.770
in his foreground you get a
closeup view of these ragpickers

00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:15.900
that are sitting here among
rags against this wall,

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:18.300
so that it's a much
more successful

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:20.710
and interesting composition
by having cropped the image

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:23.940
that way, which is
typical of what Alland did.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.090
A huge success.

00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:28.100
The exhibition was
widely covered

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:30.540
in the photographic press,
and Riis entered the history

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.970
of photograph as a
pioneer of the medium.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:42.820
In 1973, Alland published a
very well-researched biography

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.230
which featured his prints
from Riis's negatives

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:49.600
and was titled <i>Jacob A. Riis,
Photographer and Citizen </i>.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.900
Without Alland,

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:52.730
Riis's photographs
would have been lost.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:55.170
But, because of him,
Riis became known

00:17:55.170 --> 00:17:59.020
as a modern documentary
photographer, which he was not.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:02.900
In the 1950s, as interest
in Riis's photographs grew,

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:05.470
the Museum had to provide
access to the collection,

00:18:05.470 --> 00:18:07.000
most of which was made of glass

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.420
and could not be shown
in original form.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.040
To facilitate researchers
and provide prints

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.390
for reproduction the Museum
staff photographer made study

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:17.340
prints from all the negatives.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.120
Like Alland's prints, these
were eight-by-ten enlargements.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.580
But, unlike Alland's prints,
they were poor quality.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:28.080
This was the situation when I
arrived at the museum in 1987.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.820
Because of Alland's rescue and
promotion of Riis's photographs,

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.460
Riis was considered a
major modern photographer.

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:35.390
But because of the
museum's stewardship,

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:38.780
the public saw only poor study
prints made from the negatives,

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:43.150
and they knew nothing of the
additional images available only

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:45.970
as lantern slides
or vintage prints.

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:56.930
I'm wondering -- okay.

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.230
Sorry. I'll go back to that one.

00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:01.050
To compound the problem,
many photographs made

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:04.350
by Riis were attributed
to him because many

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:07.360
of the negatives
were copies of prints

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.580
by other photographers
that he acquired.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:11.680
So here is -- this is
where I need this pointer.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:15.450
If you can see, this is a --

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:20.940
Riis has pinned up Jessie Tarbox
Beals photograph with thumbtacks

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.390
and rephotographed it.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.950
So you can see the
thumbtacks here, so.

00:19:25.950 --> 00:19:29.510
And then -- and the reason he
did this is because he wanted

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:31.420
to have a lantern slide made,

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:32.810
and I'm showing you
the lantern slide

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:35.310
on the right, for his lectures.

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:38.820
This is a scene of a family
making artificial flowers

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.340
in their tenement home.

00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:45.520
And this picture was --
because this is a negative,

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.780
it's a copy negative,
this was cropped

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:53.750
so that you don't see the
thumbtacks and, you know,

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.760
printed the same size
as all the others.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:00.380
And so for many, many years
this image was attributed

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:04.110
to Riis even though it's
actually got Jessie Tarbox

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.760
Beals' signature
on the negative,

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.060
right down here [laughter].

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:10.340
So those were the
kind of, you know,

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:14.500
problems that the
collection presented.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:21.750
So, generally, curators have
enormous interpretive discretion

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:25.330
with collections, just by virtue
of selecting them and figuring

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.910
out how to present them.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.820
This case, this collection,
presented me, as the curator,

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:35.270
with a sort of alarming sense of
responsibility because by having

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:39.220
to essentially put aside these
study prints and determine how

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.820
to create new prints and how

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.480
to make the glass
lantern slides available,

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:49.040
as well as the information
and the negatives

00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.500
and the vintage prints, I was
really kind of creating --

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.700
had the responsibility
to create Riis's work,

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.970
which was daunting,
to say the least.

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:10.170
In 1994, and by this
time I was not on staff,

00:21:10.170 --> 00:21:12.330
but I was supervising
this project,

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:14.660
the museum received a grant
from the National Endowment

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:17.290
For the Humanities to create
a database of the collection,

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:20.230
to make color transparencies
of the lantern slides,

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:24.170
and to make contact prints, four
by five inches, the same size

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.630
as the negatives, on
Printing-Out Paper,

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:28.950
the type used in Riis's day.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.160
The goal was to create
prints that looked

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.590
like the vintage
prints that we did have

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:35.260
in the collection and elsewhere.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.340
This was in the wrong
order, but I'll show you.

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:40.370
This is an example of one of
the handful of vintage prints

00:21:40.370 --> 00:21:43.390
that are in the collection
that are in decent condition.

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:46.460
So this is a contact print, four
by five inches, the same size

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:52.190
as the negative, mounted
on a piece of cardboard.

00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:55.000
So these vintage material
prints, as they are called,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.930
are what the public now sees,
and there's a large sampling

00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:00.970
of these on view now in
the print exhibition.

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:07.150
That year, 1994,
I wrote an article

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:10.420
that explained the NEH access
and preservation project.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.260
It was titled, "What Are the
Photographs of Jacob Riis?"

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:18.040
And it began with a hand-colored
lantern slide of Bandit's Roost.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.200
You can see that here.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.920
This image was meant to
surprise and provoke the viewer.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.490
You think you know
Bandit's Roost?

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:25.970
Look at this.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:27.570
And that's what the
slide looks like.

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:30.740
So this is the kind of
material that was buried

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:35.220
because the lantern slides were
not available to researchers.

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.790
But this slide is an
example of how Riis's --

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:42.780
it doesn't look anything like a
modern documentary photographer.

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:45.390
There's images like this.

00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:48.100
With the new facsimiles and
the database as a foundation,

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.450
it became clear to me that
the collection was not a

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:54.500
photographer's body of work,
or oeuvre as sometimes called,

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:58.230
but the raw material for
Riis's articles and lectures.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.890
For him, the final product was
the words and pictures together.

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.830
What was needed was a study of
the photographs to delineate

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:07.710
which pictures he took,
when, and for what purpose,

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:11.200
and which pictures he acquired,
when, and for what purpose.

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.150
The detective work consisted
to creating a research folder

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:17.860
for each image and collecting
in the folder each version

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.160
of the image -- the
negative, any lantern slides,

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:23.090
and any prints --
along with photocopies

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:26.120
of each published
version of each image.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.750
The illustrations in Riis's
articles, dozens of them

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.370
which appeared in New
York daily newspapers

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:35.640
and nationally-circulating
magazines could be gleaned

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.120
from the offprints and
scrapbooks in the Riis paper

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.750
in the Library of Congress.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:44.230
In 1976, the Riis papers had
been microfilmed, and I was able

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:47.170
to purchase a copy of
the eight rolls of film

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:48.470
which became my bible.

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:49.980
And any of you have
had any experience

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.950
with microfilm know how
unpleasant an experience

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:56.160
that is, but is was vitally
important for being able

00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.220
to identify, match up
which pictures were taken

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:01.980
for which publication.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:04.990
The content of these research
folders forms the basis

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:06.290
of the current catalog.

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:10.110
In 1997, however, I did not
aim to produce a catalog.

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:11.970
I aimed to produce a narrative

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:13.630
about Riis's photographic
practice,

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:15.460
and I hoped to place
the five years

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:17.740
in which he used the
camera within the context

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.210
of his 40 years as a journalist.

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:23.100
As Aimee explained, I'm an art
historian not an historian,

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.980
and for the latter task
I was not equipped.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.970
I did not understand
Riis's world which was not

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:30.200
that of an artist, but
of journalism, politics,

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:34.890
law enforcement, and housing
at the turn of the century.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.970
Doing some preliminary
research I learned

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:39.700
that Riis was an important
figure in American history,

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:42.010
regardless of the photographs,

00:24:42.010 --> 00:24:45.500
but for his writings
and his activism.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.070
To get my bearings in
the history of the period

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.520
and to bridge the dialog
in two disparate fields,

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:53.540
I needed the help
of an historian.

00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:57.190
So I reached out to Dan Czitrom,
a Professor of American History

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:58.930
at Mount Holyoke College.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:01.900
As independent scholars, we
were awarded an NEH Grant

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.200
in collaborative research
to prepare a book on Riis

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:10.610
which was published in 2007, and
came out in paperback in 2014.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:14.730
And that's this little book.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:17.250
While Dan and I were working on
our book, the museum embarked

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:20.180
on a massive digitization
of its photo collections

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:23.470
and the Riis collection
among others is now fully

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:24.960
available online.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.910
As incredible as this
accomplishment is,

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:28.210
it highlighted a problem.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:31.690
The information that accompanied
the digital images online was

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:35.080
the preliminary research
done in 1994 as part

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:38.410
of that original NEH Access
and Preservation Grant.

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:42.010
The museum was sending serious
researchers to me, personally,

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:45.410
to help them better understand
what they encountered online,

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:48.610
which sent me time and
again to my research files.

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:51.960
I realized that there was a
real need for a complete catalog

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.050
of the collection that would
place Riis's photographs

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:57.460
in the context of his writings
and sort out the knotty problems

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:00.880
of attribution; that is, to
explain which picture he took,

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.050
which he asked others to take
for him, and when, and why.

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:08.040
In 2012 I offered the contents
of my files to the museum

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:10.210
and asked if it was interested

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:12.660
in supporting the
publication of a catalog.

00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:16.740
The museum decided to sponsor
the catalog, and a primary goal

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.370
of the catalog is to
contrast Riis's photographs

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.510
with the published
illustrations,

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:26.940
which predated the accurate
halftones that became standard

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.150
by the turn of the
century, by 1900.

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:32.150
This required extensive
photography

00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:33.500
of Riis's articles and books.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.570
That is, it required reliance

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:38.310
on the Jacob Riis papers
here in the library.

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:41.300
A dialog between the two
institutions resulted

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.260
in a partnership to
jointly publish the catalog.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.590
For me this was a godsend.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:48.780
After years of peering at
smudgy images on microfilm,

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.980
I was able to examine the
original scrapbooks and letters.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:56.530
It was as if I finally met this
man I had studied for so long.

00:26:56.530 --> 00:26:59.530
As the Museum and Library
worked out a formal agreement,

00:26:59.530 --> 00:27:03.020
I began meeting with Aimee
who edited the catalog,

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.250
Barbara Behr [assumed
spelling], Curator in the Museum

00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:07.840
in the Manuscripts and Archives
Division, and Cheryl Regan,

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.520
Director of Exhibitions.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.540
They were invaluable partners
who not only brought the catalog

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:13.840
and the exhibition into being,

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.650
but enhanced my understanding
of Riis.

00:27:16.650 --> 00:27:20.450
And Beverly Brannon also, who
is a Curator in the Prints

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:24.160
and Photograph Department,
helped me with the --

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.620
was invaluable in helping
me with the Riis photographs

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:29.940
that are also part of
the collection here.

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.980
Having told my Riis story,
let me brief you of the story

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:37.170
of Riis as I've come
to understand it.

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:41.010
Jacob August Riis was born
in 1849 in Ribe, Denmark,

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:43.960
a cathedral town more
connected to the medieval past

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.790
than the industrial present.

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:48.090
Riis was a restless,
even rebellious child

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.590
who at age 20 left
home for America,

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:53.240
a place about which
he knew nothing.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.930
In his autobiography
he mentioned

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:57.050
that he loved James
Fenimore Cooper's stories

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:58.350
of American Indians.

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:00.880
And when he arrived in New
York he purchased a gun

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:04.540
which he brandished and narrowly
escaped getting arrested.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.650
Although Riis's example is
perhaps more colorful than most,

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:09.480
his desire to reinvent himself

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:13.500
in a new land was a
common 19th century story.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:16.080
America was built by waves
of European immigrants --

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.430
Irish, German, Chinese,

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:19.770
Scandinavians, Italians,
and Jews.

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:22.640
Between 1870 and 1900, a tenth

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.330
of all Danes left
home for America.

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:30.740
This is one of -- these, by
the way, are Riis's slides

00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:32.640
in his own autobiographical
lecture.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.290
These are a copy of
his slides which are

00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:36.860
in this collection here.

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.570
Most Danish immigrants travelled
to the Midwest as homesteaders,

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:43.880
and in many instances they
founded their own communities.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.960
By contrast, Riis spent five
years wandering from place

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.630
to place, job to job, failing

00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:50.940
to establish a foothold
time and again.

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.440
The immigrant sense of
alienation, of being caught

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.770
between old and the new,

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:59.620
and feeling misunderstood was
perhaps extreme in Riis's case.

00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:03.180
Explaining why he slept on
this gravestone in Brunswick,

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.630
New Jersey, Riis wrote, "The
night dews and the snakes

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:09.580
and the dogs that kept sniffing
and growling had made me tired

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.100
of sleeping in the fields.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.970
The dead were much
better company.

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:18.210
They minded their own business
and let a fellow alone."

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:21.250
What motivated Riis to
continue was his determination

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:24.280
to win the hand of Elizabeth
Gertz, a girl from Ribe,

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.930
his hometown, who was socially
beyond his reach there.

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:30.020
Against all odds,
she was unmarried

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.680
when he asked for
her hand in 1875.

00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.710
That's after his five
years of failure.

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:39.270
And she accepted despite the
fact that she barely knew him.

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:41.140
He brought Elizabeth
back to America.

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.440
They had five children.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.730
And Riis settled the family
in a house with a large garden

00:29:44.730 --> 00:29:47.300
in Richmond Hill, Queens.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:50.790
Riis succeeded in fulfilling
every immigrant's dream

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.630
of middle class respectability.

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:55.120
And this is perhaps
not that descriptive,

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.740
but one of the most
charming pictures

00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:00.050
of his family snapshots
that he took.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:02.830
His house is -- you can
see in the background,

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:04.260
on this large property they had.

00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:07.010
That's his daughter,
Katie, with her pet goat.

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:12.400
And you can see Riis's
shadow in the front

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.940
where he's holding the camera.

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:20.230
Riis finally -- okay.

00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:23.090
Riis finally found his way in
America as a newspaper man.

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:26.410
In 1876 he landed a job
as a police reporter

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:29.930
for the <i>New York Tribune </i>and
later for the <i>Evening Sun </i>.

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:32.260
The daily police beat
provided his base salary

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:35.160
for 23 years until 1899.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.130
This was the era of
yellow journalism

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:39.420
in which New York's many
daily papers competed

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.490
for screaming headlines
and sensational stories.

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:45.870
Riis explained, "The
police reporter

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:49.360
on a newspaper is the one who
gathers and handles all the news

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:52.990
that means trouble to someone,
the murders, fires, suicides,

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:57.160
robberies, and all that sort,
before it gets into court."

00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:00.270
Police reporters shared an
office at 301 Mulberry Street,

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:02.110
across the street from
Police Headquarters

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:04.900
in the middle of
a six-ward slum.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.090
For eight years Riis
worked the nightshift

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:10.220
and became box reporter
through sheer hard work.

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.410
He also honed his
storytelling skills,

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:15.850
although his articles
often read like tales

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:18.720
by Hans Christian
Anderson, a fellow Dane.

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.370
But he insisted they
were true fact.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:23.860
"I cannot [inaudible],"
he claimed.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.960
Next to a clipping in one of
his scrapbooks Riis wrote,

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.850
"This was the last
Christmas story I wrote

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:30.660
for my paper, <i>The
Evening Sun </i>.

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:34.040
They laughed it to scorn in the
office and made no end of fun

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:36.440
of it, and yet, of all the
stories I have written,

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.740
I like it best.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.970
It moved me more deeply
than any of the rest."

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:42.660
So, in this picture,
which is also

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:46.660
in the Library's collection,
that's Riis back there,

00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.540
essentially waiting for his

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.710
from Police Headquarters
across the street.

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:53.490
And this picture's kind
of fascinating because --

00:31:53.490 --> 00:31:56.720
and it's on view right
now in the exhibit --

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.060
because of this wall
of photo reproductions

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.640
from magazines that
covers the wall.

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:07.050
In 1884, Riis moved from
the night to the dayshift.

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:09.570
And as he said, "My
eggs hatched."

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:11.070
He began by covering
the meetings

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:14.500
of the 1884 Tenement House
Commission which convened

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.950
at Police Headquarters.

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:18.860
In this way, Riis learned of the
community of philanthropists,

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.610
engineers, and architects
who aimed

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:22.710
to change the lives
of tenement dwellers.

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:25.600
He became a student, an
advocate of the latest ideas

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:29.200
in housing reform which soon
expanded to include education,

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:31.360
public parks and
playgrounds, public health

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.110
and immigration policy.

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:39.070
In 1887, Riis read about the
German invention of flash powder

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:40.370
in which a powerful burst

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:43.750
of light could illuminate
scenes photographed in the dark.

00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:46.150
He had the idea that he
could use photographs

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:48.610
to show what his
words could only tell.

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:51.050
Although he had no intention
of photographing himself,

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:54.810
and at first he didn't, this
was a truly revolutionary idea.

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:58.470
About this picture, Five
Cents A Spot, Riis wrote,

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:01.140
"I recall a midnight
expedition to the Mulberry Bend

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:03.340
with the Sanitary Police
that had turned up a couple

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:05.990
of characteristic
cases of overcrowding.

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:09.330
In one instance, two rooms that
should, at most, have held four

00:33:09.330 --> 00:33:12.360
or five sleepers were
found to contain 15,

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.540
a week-old baby among them.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:16.270
Most of them were
lodgers and slept there

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:18.110
for five cents a spot.

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:20.370
There was no pretense of beds.

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:23.360
When the report was submitted to
the Health Board the next day,

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:24.900
it did not make much
of an impression.

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:28.740
These things rarely do, put in
mere words, until my negatives,

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.140
still dripping from
the darkroom,

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.670
came to reinforce them.

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:33.970
From them there was no appeal."

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:40.740
Riis first showed his
photographs in January, 1888,

00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.270
at the monthly meeting of
the Lantern Slide Committee

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:46.350
of the Society of Amateur
Photographers of New York.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:48.730
The meeting was arranged
by two society members

00:33:48.730 --> 00:33:50.990
who were interested in the
new flashlight photography

00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:53.640
and had helped Riis take
his first photographs.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.540
Titling his talk, How the Other
Half Lives and Dies in New York,

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.870
Riis showed 100 slides,
spoke for two hours,

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:01.100
and invited his friends
from the press.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.780
The extensive press coverage led
to his delivering his lecture

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:05.080
to various church groups.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:07.770
In the following year he
was asked by two editors

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:09.770
of <i>Scribner's Magazine</i>
to write an article

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:11.780
for this prestigious
illustrated journal

00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.100
that circulated nationally.

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.670
In 1890, <i>Scribner's </i>published
a book-length version,

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:20.150
<i>How the Other Half Lives </i>which
became a national best-seller.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:22.270
This book was what
Riis is most known for,

00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:23.880
and is often considered
the beginning

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.670
of modern photojournalism.

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:28.010
However, the book is
in many ways unmodern,

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:30.970
or at least modern in ways
we no longer relate to.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.430
The revolutionary
flashlight photographs

00:34:36.430 --> 00:34:39.830
such as Five Cents A Spot
remain disturbing, even today.

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:41.840
However, they have
been rightly criticized

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:44.580
for portraying the city's
homeless as hapless victims

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:47.270
who were photographed
without their permission.

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:49.600
Indeed, Riis gave
them a good scare.

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.390
He burst into the room with what
he called a raiding party --

00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:55.050
two photographers, a Sanitary
Policeman, and himself --

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:56.910
and set off an explosion.

00:34:56.910 --> 00:34:59.530
On several occasions the
combustible flash powder caused

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:00.830
a fire.

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:04.420
During Riis's lifetime, the only
times his photographs were seen

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:07.300
as photographs were in
his lectures, like this,

00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:10.800
projected on a wall, when they
were projected on a screen

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.220
or wall for a live audience.

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.470
In his article and
books on the other hand,

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:17.600
they were most often
copied as wood engravings.

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:19.920
This explains why the
photographs were almost never

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:23.870
mentioned in the dozen of
reviews of Five Cents A Spot.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.430
And this shows Five Cents a
Spot in the wood engravings

00:35:30.430 --> 00:35:32.730
that has appeared in the book.

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:40.070
For a century after
it was written,

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:44.420
<i>How the Other Half Lives </i>was
praised as a call to conscience.

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:48.250
But in the 1990s many critics
began to fault Riis for relying

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:49.550
on racial stereotypes.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:53.640
And this is a picture of
an opium den in Chinatown.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:56.010
Indeed, the book is
organized as a slum tour

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:58.390
in which Riis leads his
audience through neighborhoods

00:35:58.390 --> 00:36:00.960
of Italians, Jews,
Chinese, et cetera.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:04.490
In his day, the slum tour was an
established literary tradition

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:06.350
which grew out of
actual guided tours

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:11.260
of New York's neighborhoods,
rich and poor.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:14.470
Matthew Hale Smith's <i>Sunshine
and Shadow of New York </i>written

00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:19.140
in 1869, a generation before,
is a classic of the genre.

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.180
And you can see here,
this shows --

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:23.660
the sunshine is the
picture of a wealthy --

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.640
of a huge mansion
on Fifth Avenue,

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.300
and the shadow shows a slum.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:30.040
This actually looks
like Five Points.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.340
Yeah, it would have
been Five Points,

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:33.900
which was the most famous
New York slum of the time.

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:41.250
Riis's book married the
voyeuristic slum tour

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:42.970
with a Christian sermon.

00:36:42.970 --> 00:36:45.740
<i>How the Other Half Lives</i>
starts and ends with passages

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.890
from the parable, "A Poem"
by James Russell Lowell,

00:36:48.890 --> 00:36:50.640
in which Christ chastises
men of [inaudible]

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:53.460
for ignoring their less
fortunate brethren.

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.890
The book ends with
Lowell's question,

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:59.210
"Think ye that building shall
endure which shelters the noble

00:36:59.210 --> 00:37:01.210
and crushes the poor?"

00:37:01.210 --> 00:37:03.560
It was Riis's genius
to walk the tightrope

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.110
between popular entertainment
and moral uplift.

00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:10.170
For a 21st century
reader, the book is a relic

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:13.130
of Victorian sensibility.

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:16.610
Most discussions of Riis do not
go beyond <i>How the Other Half</i>

00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:17.910
<i>Lives </i>.

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:19.660
But the book, which
was published in 1890,

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:21.660
when Riis was 41 years old,

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.750
marks only the beginning
of his reform work.

00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:25.630
His later career,
which is less known,

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:27.970
sheds light on other
features of modernity.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:33.910
After the success of his first
book, Riis immediately got

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:36.040
to work on a sequel, <i>The
Children of the Poor </i>,

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:39.120
which was first published in
<i>Scribner's Magazine </i>and then

00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:42.380
as a full-length book in 1892.

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:44.580
And this shows the opening page.

00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:46.610
The picture on the
left is unrelated.

00:37:46.610 --> 00:37:47.910
It's for another article.

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:49.840
But this shows you the
first page of <i>The Children</i>

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.450
<i>of the Poor </i>in <i>Scribner's </i>,

00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:56.840
and features very
worked-over halftone.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.160
Again, this is this
transitional moment

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.510
in reproductive technology,
of Little Katie, who I'm going

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:05.680
to introduce you to in a moment.

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.530
Perhaps because his
subjects were children

00:38:08.530 --> 00:38:11.260
or because he grew more
comfortable with the camera,

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.770
Riis changed his
approach to photographing.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:15.630
Typical of the photographs
in <i>Children</i>

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:17.850
<i>of the Poor </i>is Little
Katie whose picture

00:38:17.850 --> 00:38:21.470
in a heavily reworked halftone
opens the <i>Scribner's </i>article.

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:25.990
Katie was a nine-year-old
who Riis met on a visit

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:29.400
to the West 52nd Street
Industrial School founded

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.410
by the Children's Aid Society
to provide classes for children

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:34.750
who did not attend
public school.

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:37.740
Unlike the raiding party of the
earlier flashlight photographs,

00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:40.640
Riis introduced himself to
Katie and interviewed her.

00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:43.790
He learned that when her mother
died her father took a new wife

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:46.110
and she and her older
siblings moved out.

00:38:46.110 --> 00:38:49.250
Katie kept house for them
while they worked in factories.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:51.260
"About Katie," Riis remarked,

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.560
"this picture shows what
a sober, patient, sturdy,

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.920
little thing she was with
that dull life wearing

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.220
on her day-by-day.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.340
She got right up when asked
and stood for her picture

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:01.650
without a question
and without a smile.

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:03.040
'What kind of work
do you do,' I asked,

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:05.350
thinking to interest
her while I made ready.

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.450
'I scrub,' she replied promptly.

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:08.750
And her look guaranteed

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:12.140
that what she scrubbed
came out clean."

00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:15.420
This new approach, in which
the photographer shows respect

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.060
for his subject and gives
her a voice, is more in line

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:21.270
with current values and
representational practices.

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:24.520
The book, which combined
these word and image portraits

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:26.800
with Board of Health
statistics and a survey

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.910
of charity programs, was
a commercial failure.

00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:37.950
Between 1891 and 1893, Riis
used the camera regularly

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:40.630
as an extension of his writing.

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:43.680
While preparing <i>The Children of
the Poor </i>he also took a series

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.330
of photographs of three news --

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:47.570
for three newspaper
exposes dealing

00:39:47.570 --> 00:39:49.890
with threats to public health.

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:52.810
He photographed 11
Riverside dumps to show

00:39:52.810 --> 00:39:55.120
that the law banning
ragpickers from living

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.240
in the dumps went unenforced.

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.470
He went upstate to
the Croton Reservoir,

00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:01.910
the source of New York's water
supply, to document industrial

00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:03.210
and agricultural pollution.

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:06.290
And he photographed
the abysmal conditions

00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:08.460
of nine police station
lodging houses,

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:12.320
the only municipal shelters
available to the homeless.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:15.460
This was investigative
journalism in the modern sense.

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:17.290
But Riis was too far
ahead of his time.

00:40:17.290 --> 00:40:19.300
And this is one of
the photographs

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.970
of the lodging houses
that he took in 1892.

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:31.320
This is the <i>New York
Tribune </i>from January, 1892,

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:35.310
an article about
these lodging houses.

00:40:35.310 --> 00:40:38.400
The reproductive technology of
the time kept his photographs

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.670
from being seen at
full strength.

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:43.060
Newspapers made single-line
wood engravings

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:45.310
after the photographs,
which did not look

00:40:45.310 --> 00:40:46.760
like photographs at all.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:53.510
So just -- that's the
way the picture was seen.

00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:58.680
Because of an outbreak of
typhus in the lodging houses,

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.320
Riis gave a lantern
slide lecture

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.290
at the Academy of
Medicine in 1893.

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:04.690
Other than this one lecture,

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:06.850
the public never saw
these photographs.

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:10.450
Perhaps for this reason Riis
gave up newspaper photography

00:41:10.450 --> 00:41:14.900
in 1893 and used the camera
only occasionally thereafter.

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:17.730
Riis's life took
a new turn in 1895

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:20.330
when a good government
mayor, William L. Strong,

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:22.870
defeated the Tammany
Hall political machine

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:24.920
and Strong appointed
Theodore Roosevelt

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:26.710
as his Police Commissioner.

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:29.210
Having read how the other
half lived, Roosevelt walked

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:31.600
across the street from
Police Headquarters

00:41:31.600 --> 00:41:34.800
to Riis's Mulberry Street
office to seek his advice.

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:37.410
The two men became very close
friends, and for a short

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:40.970
but significant period Riis
had access to political power.

00:41:40.970 --> 00:41:46.330
Thanks to Riis's advocacy,
mostly behind the scenes,

00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:49.650
the worst of the old tenements,
the infamous Gotham Court

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:52.550
and the Mott Street Barracks,
and this is a picture taken

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:54.420
on the roof of the
Mott Street Barracks

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:58.440
where families are
basically escaping the heat

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:04.440
of the interior for the roof.

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:07.340
These big horrible
barracks, Gotham Court

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:10.110
and Mott Street,
were demolished.

00:42:10.110 --> 00:42:11.930
The police lodging
houses were closed.

00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:14.880
And the notorious
Mulberry Bend was condemned

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.770
to construct a small park.

00:42:17.770 --> 00:42:20.340
This is Riis's photograph
of Mulberry Bend.

00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:23.310
It actually shows the bend in
the street, which is still --

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:24.610
it's still a street
of tenements.

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:26.630
You can still see it.

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:29.480
And this is the park
that replaced it.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:34.130
This is a photograph
from 1901, not by Riis.

00:42:34.130 --> 00:42:38.040
What I mean by saying it's still
there is that the park is on --

00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:43.970
this is trying, this is trying
to -- this row is still there.

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:52.070
Riis also convinces city
to condemn buildings

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:54.480
on the Lower East Side to
build two more small parks,

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:57.350
Hamilton Fish Park and
Seward Park which continue

00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:59.780
to serve local residents today.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.540
By the end of the
Strong Administration,

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:04.130
which was only one
term of two years,

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:06.380
before Tammany was
elected back in,

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:08.760
Riis began to take
a retrospective view

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:10.780
of his decade of reform.

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:15.560
In 1900 he published a book
called <i>The Ten Years' War </i>.

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:20.220
That's 1890 when his first
book was published in 1900.

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:23.370
And 1902 a follow-up which
is essentially the same book

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:27.800
with more illustrations called
<i>The Battle of the Slum </i>.

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:30.690
Also by 1900 the
photographic halftone

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:31.990
in which the tonal value

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:34.530
of photographs could be
economically reproduced

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:37.700
with text on the same
page was nearly universal

00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.440
in magazines and books.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.050
As a result, there was an
increased demand for photographs

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:44.540
of all sorts, including
photographs Riis needed

00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:45.920
for his new books.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:48.350
Professionals filled
the new demand and Riis,

00:43:48.350 --> 00:43:49.920
rather than taking
new photographs,

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:51.350
began to collect them.

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:54.690
Half of his collection consists
of photographs of new schools,

00:43:54.690 --> 00:43:57.110
model tenements,
public parks, et cetera,

00:43:57.110 --> 00:43:59.410
by professional photographers.

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:06.650
In this typical example,
Riis wrote an article

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:10.100
for <i>Garden Magazine </i>about the
Jacob Riis Settlement House,

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:12.510
a Social Service
Organization on Henry Street

00:44:12.510 --> 00:44:15.880
on the Lower East Side, which
he helped found in the 1880s,

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.230
and which was named
for him in 1901.

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:20.530
It moved to Long
Island City in 1951

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:22.270
and still provides
essential services

00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:23.880
for the community there.

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.710
The magazine sent a
professional photographer

00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:29.270
to take these pictures
for the article.

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:33.460
And Riis had lantern slides
made from them for his lecture.

00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:37.040
So these are lantern slides
in the collection made

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:40.970
from the photographs
of this article.

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.260
Yeah, I think I just
showed you the ones.

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:49.080
When Riis quit his
newspaper job in 1899,

00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.610
he began to spend several
months a year travelling all

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:54.260
over the country delivering
illustrated lectures

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:57.180
to fill in for lost income.

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:59.500
Lecture bureaus arranged
scheduling and billing

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:02.560
for this popular form of
educational entertainment.

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.040
For each of his books, Riis
developed a slide lecture

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.560
and travelled the country,

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:12.210
very like today's book
tours or a Ted Talk.

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:13.910
So this is actually
a lantern slide,

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:16.830
but it was basically a
photograph of a poster

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:21.890
for his lecture, "The Battle of
the Slum, Illustrated by scores

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:25.050
of original stereopticon
pictures of New York City life,"

00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:27.950
is what the title says.

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:37.510
Oh boy. That is terrible
[laughter].

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:40.420
It's actually -- it's
from a microfilm,

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:43.580
but I'll just tell you about it.

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:46.750
Riis -- I don't have the
original because it's --

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:48.050
well, it's in the collection.

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:49.350
It wasn't microfilmed at all.

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:52.980
This is from a microfilm from
another -- from Chicago Library.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:56.000
Because it was so big,
it was just in shreds,

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.300
and sadly not copied here.

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:01.890
But, anyway.

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:05.610
Riis's use of the mass media,
including lecture circuit,

00:46:05.610 --> 00:46:09.680
made Riis the nation's face
and voice of urban reform.

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:13.210
So here's a great
story about this image.

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:16.060
<i>The Chicago Tribune </i>,
for example, ran a series

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:20.780
of seven full-page articles,
"The Story of the Slum,"

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:24.340
which in -- seven weeks in
a row, the entire first page

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:26.400
of their editorial section.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:31.300
And so this is the first one,
and it's called "The Story

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:32.920
of the Slum, Part One."

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:37.650
And it shows some of Riis's
pictures and his portrait,

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:43.480
all in wood engravings after
his -- after the photographs.

00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:48.390
So for this Riis was paid $1000
which was about $29,000 today.

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:51.330
So it gives you some sense
of his national reputation.

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:53.310
Let's get rid of that
terrible picture.

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:57.990
In 1901, Riis published
his autobiography,

00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:00.760
<i>The Making of an American</i>
, a confessional test built

00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:03.110
around two characters,
his wife, Elizabeth,

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:05.450
and his friend, Teddy Roosevelt.

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:08.570
The book was published on
Riis's 25th wedding anniversary

00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:11.480
and just months after
Roosevelt became President,

00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:13.600
a stroke of fate due
to the assassination

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:15.660
of President William McKinley.

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.470
The story of a poor
young foreigner

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:20.320
who became a happily married
father of five and a visitor

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:23.360
to the White House proved
irresistible to the public.

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:25.510
Riis published a dozen
books, but only two,

00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:27.470
<i>How The Other Half
Lives </i>, the slum tour

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:29.900
and Christian sermon
combined , and <i>The Making</i>

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:35.030
<i>of an American </i>, the sort
of confessional story of rise

00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:39.860
from poverty to the White
House, were best-sellers.

00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:44.350
And this is a silver wedding
anniversary photograph of Riis

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:46.280
and his wife actually taken

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.200
by a well-known portrait
photographer,

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.500
Gertrude [inaudible].

00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.300
Riis's autobiography
-- let me see.

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:53.600
I'm sorry.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:59.590
So. And here is a copy -- a
cover of the first edition

00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:01.490
of <i>The Making of an American </i>.

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:03.840
Riis's autobiography
has been compared

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.570
to Horatio Alger's
contemporaneous rags-to-riches

00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:09.260
stories and to the
American dream,

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:12.060
a term not coined though
until the Depression.

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:16.390
The book also bears comparison
to our own confessional culture.

00:48:16.390 --> 00:48:19.050
Indeed, Riis was mocked in the
press for telling all he knows

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:21.440
and feels, which makes
you feel sorry for him.

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:24.020
And his children were
teased, he explains,

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:26.970
that their father was a bum
once people knew the story.

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:34.160
Riis no longer -- no
doubt enjoyed his fame,

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:37.430
but he used his candor
to further his cause,

00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:40.220
not unlike today's celebrities
who reveal their histories

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:43.870
of sexual abuse or addiction to
encourage public understanding

00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:45.490
of challenging issues.

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:49.710
This amusing caricature of Riis
pounding on a lectern appeared

00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:52.560
with a review of his
lecture in the San Jose,

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:56.420
California <i>Mercury </i>in 1911.

00:48:56.420 --> 00:49:00.140
The reporter noted, "Simple
as the story was told,

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:02.300
it held the listeners rapt.

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:04.060
'If,' said Riis in closing,

00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:07.290
'the story of one plain
immigrant lad helps you to look

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:10.930
with kind eyes on one
little unfortunate lad,

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:13.230
I shall think my
words well-spoken.'"

00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:21.840
So, that's my view of --
my summary of his career

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:26.230
and how the photographs
enter in.

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:29.050
So this is the current
book, the catalogue.

00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:31.410
And so, to conclude, let
me just say a few words

00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:32.710
about the catalogue.

00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:37.490
In the 1990s, when I was working
with Dan Czitrom on our book,

00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:39.010
I felt that a complete catalogue

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:41.600
of the Riis collection would
send the wrong message.

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:44.550
A complete catalogue or,
as art historians call it,

00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:46.880
a catalogue raisonne, identifies

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:49.160
and describes the complete
works of an artist.

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.080
I was concerned that a book

00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:54.210
of this sort would reinforce
the incorrect notion,

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:58.490
current at the time, that Riis
was a photographic artist.

00:49:58.490 --> 00:50:01.100
Indeed, I had just finished
a complete catalogue

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:03.360
of another major collection
belonging to the Museum

00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:04.740
of the City of New York,

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:06.040
"Bernice Abbott's
Changing New York."

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:09.540
Unlike Riis, Abbott was a
professional photographer

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.800
and an avant-garde
artist who created one

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:15.890
of the great artworks of body
support of the 20th century.

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:19.700
Photographing New York for
10 years, from 1929 to 1939,

00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:21.610
she defined changing New York

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:25.530
by making 305 signed exhibition
prints which she presented

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:29.630
to the museum, who was
the project's sponsor.

00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:33.830
This kind of artistic intent
is exactly what Riis lacked.

00:50:33.830 --> 00:50:37.650
But over time, the need for a
complete catalogue became clear.

00:50:37.650 --> 00:50:41.080
As I mentioned earlier, scholars
need to know the who, when,

00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.700
why story behind
each photograph.

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:46.950
The book provides a basis for
further research in a variety

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:49.970
of fields, especially
history and media studies.

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:56.450
Take Bandit's Roost for example.

00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:59.380
This most famous of Riis's
photographs was not taken

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:00.680
by him.

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:04.130
It was taken for him in
1887 by the two amateurs

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:07.100
who arranged his first
talk at the Society

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:09.490
of Amateur Photographers
of New York.

00:51:09.490 --> 00:51:12.800
And it was made with
a stereoscopic camera

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:15.550
which had two lenses
mounted side-by-side

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:19.310
to produce two images
on a glass negative.

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:23.650
At some point this negative
was divided in half,

00:51:23.650 --> 00:51:28.580
and that's why you see the
two images separated here.

00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:32.630
And they differ slightly
because the lens

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:36.060
on the left shows you more
information on the left.

00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:40.120
There's a mother and two little
children here on the left.

00:51:40.120 --> 00:51:44.830
And on the right you have more
information featuring this tough

00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:47.130
Italian dude with a bowler hat.

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:52.980
Riis's four lantern slides
of Bandit's Roost were made

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:55.590
from the right side,
featuring the young tough

00:51:55.590 --> 00:51:58.470
which better illustrated his
point about the dangerousness

00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:01.560
of the back alleys
of Mulberry Bend.

00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:03.700
This kind of close visual
reading is essential

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:05.000
for scholars seeking

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.880
to understand Riis
as a photographer.

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:09.050
The catalogue also serves,
though, the interests

00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:10.780
of the general reader.

00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:13.810
Riis was wrong that his
photographs were of no value

00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:16.270
when seen apart from
his arguments.

00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:19.250
But they are of much greater
value when paired with them.

00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:20.770
Oh, sorry.

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:22.400
That's a stereoscopic camera,

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:26.920
so you understand what I
mean about the two lenses.

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:30.630
"Five Cents A Spot" is much more
moving when we learn from Riis

00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:34.320
that 15 people, including a
week-old baby, were sleeping

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:36.620
in that illegal lodging house.

00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.510
And when we learned that Little
Katie was nine years old,

00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:42.810
that her mother had died,

00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:44.120
and her father had
abandoned his children,

00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:47.260
and that she kept
house for her siblings,

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:50.360
the photograph becomes
much more meaningful.

00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:52.900
By studying each of Riis's
photographs and pairing it

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:55.610
with his words, the
catalogue brings us closer

00:52:55.610 --> 00:52:58.650
to the empathetic experience
that Riis sought to inspire

00:52:58.650 --> 00:53:01.930
in his audiences more
than a century ago.

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:03.730
Thank you very much.

00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:11.560
[ Applause ]

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.860
I think --

00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:14.160
&gt;&gt; Guy Lamolinara:
There's time for questions.

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:15.460
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Yochelson: You
have a few questions?

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:16.760
If anybody has any.

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.380
Could we turn some lights on
because I can't see anyone?

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:20.680
Yes.

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:25.740
&gt;&gt; What edition of <i>How The
Other Half Lives </i>has the

00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:27.040
best photographs?

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.340
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Yochelson:
That is a very good

00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:29.640
and complicated questions.

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.940
It depends what you
mean by the best.

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:38.140
You know, I'm -- there've
been -- there are so --

00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:40.570
when you go on Amazon, and look
at <i>How The Other Half Lives </i>,

00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:43.500
there are so many editions.

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.510
The Museum has only been giving

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:50.330
out these vintage
material prints of late.

00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:55.220
But, honestly, I think the
best -- well, before you said,

00:53:55.220 --> 00:53:57.130
which has the best photographs,
if you had just said

00:53:57.130 --> 00:53:59.060
which is the best edition,
I would say the one

00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:02.370
that copies the original book,
that shows the wood engravings

00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:04.230
and the lantern slides,
because then you --

00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:07.470
it puts the book in context.

00:54:07.470 --> 00:54:12.950
There was, in the '70s, an
edition photographed with 100 --

00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:15.540
an edition of the
book photographed --

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:22.390
cheap, but large
reproductions by Dover Press.

00:54:22.390 --> 00:54:25.130
You know, very inexpensive,
very accessible edition.

00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:27.370
That has 100 pictures in it.

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:29.720
They're just chosen
arbitrarily by an editor,

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:32.550
but it shows you
a lot of pictures.

00:54:32.550 --> 00:54:36.290
There have been -- but I would
say there have been other

00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:40.910
editions that have tried to use
the modern prints with the book,

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:44.660
but they kind of destroy
the book as an entity

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:48.980
by interjecting the modern
photographs with the story.

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:53.440
So I don't have -- I sort
of don't like those books,

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.870
and I haven't really -- sorry,
I've never really thought

00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:57.460
about how to answer
your question.

00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.980
It's the facsimiles of the
original that strike me

00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:01.390
as the best way to
look at the books.

00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:04.740
And all the pictures are
available on the Internet,

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:07.780
on the Museum's website, so
that if there's any image

00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:11.180
that you're interested in, you
could see a beautiful, you know,

00:55:11.180 --> 00:55:13.830
high-res scan of it on
the Museum's website

00:55:13.830 --> 00:55:15.130
of any individual picture.

00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:16.430
Yes.

00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:18.350
&gt;&gt; Let me ask you.

00:55:18.350 --> 00:55:26.700
You said that -- I'll just
start at the beginning.

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:28.420
[Inaudible] was just
using [inaudible] what you

00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:29.720
were saying.

00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:35.270
But afterwards you kind
of started to, I suppose,

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:37.420
[inaudible] there may
be one [inaudible].

00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:40.890
Was he ever -- did he ever talk
about photographers at that time

00:55:40.890 --> 00:55:45.060
that influenced him, or did he
ever show any interest in that,

00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:47.860
or was it just that, you know,

00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:50.250
he needed [inaudible]
his pocket?

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:52.080
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Yochelson:
He wasn't interested --

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:54.440
he didn't think about
authorship at all.

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:58.060
I mean, he was not
interested in making pictures.

00:55:58.060 --> 00:56:02.150
You know, his pictures were
represented however a publisher

00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:03.640
wanted to show them, you know.

00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:06.500
So he would give them a
print, one of those prints

00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:08.850
like the vintage print I
showed you mounted on board,

00:56:08.850 --> 00:56:11.640
and then they would have an
artist interpret it however

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:13.270
that magazine wanted to use it.

00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:17.450
So he was never interested in
the follow-up in that regard.

00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:19.150
When he had those
lantern slides made,

00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:21.240
and he wanted those
sometime colored,

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:24.040
it would have more impact,
they were colored by --

00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.920
he never worked in a darkroom.

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:27.850
He used the camera.

00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:33.580
Then he went -- he took his
pictures to a commercial studio.

00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:36.150
They made prints that he would
then give to his publishers.

00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:37.450
They made his lantern slides.

00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:39.530
I want a lantern
slide of this or that.

00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:41.800
Make this hand-colored or that.

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:45.130
He just didn't have a modern
sensibility about photography

00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:49.690
at all, so -- and he only used
the camera for five years.

00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:53.150
I mean, he was -- this is a
guy who wrote dozens and dozens

00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:59.830
of articles, 13 books, was
a really skillful writer.

00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:01.290
And, you know, the
cameras were --

00:57:01.290 --> 00:57:03.960
the images were critical
because of the lectures.

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:05.660
I mean, they were
absolutely critical.

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:08.720
They're really not
critical in his books.

00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:11.880
And they're almost not
commented on by reviewers.

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:15.330
But the lectures were -- he was
really aiming at those lectures.

00:57:15.330 --> 00:57:16.630
And as I say, as soon

00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:19.660
as he could get the photographs
he needed, and by that I mean --

00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:21.920
I have no idea who
the photographers are.

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:23.220
You know, there were two

00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:24.770
by Jessie Tarbox Beals
who's quite well-known,

00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:30.390
and seven in 1911 that
he acquired of Lewis Hine

00:57:30.390 --> 00:57:33.070
from the National Child
Labor Committee that appeared

00:57:33.070 --> 00:57:38.510
in one article in <i>Scribner's</i>
in 1911, which was a summary

00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:42.440
of the social reform
in the country.

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:46.270
But other than that,
there are just, you know,

00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:48.940
pictures that were clearly
like a public school's

00:57:48.940 --> 00:57:51.950
that were commissioned
by the Board of Ed or,

00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:53.250
you know, things like that.

00:57:53.250 --> 00:57:55.360
I mean, so he wasn't
really collecting --

00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:58.490
there's no indication that
he was collecting photographs

00:57:58.490 --> 00:58:02.100
with an eye to the images,
just to the subjects.

00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:04.450
Yes.

00:58:04.450 --> 00:58:06.840
&gt;&gt; How do you graphically
diverse for his lectures?

00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:10.260
Did he [inaudible]
to give lectures?

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:11.560
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Yochelson: No.

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:13.180
He travelled the country.

00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:14.700
There were these
-- he travelled --

00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:17.670
he started out locally
because that was, you know,

00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:20.610
he was just -- whatever
could come up he actually --

00:58:20.610 --> 00:58:22.390
there was a mission
on the Bowery

00:58:22.390 --> 00:58:27.000
that actually helped him
book his earliest lectures.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.300
It was -- this mission
actually lent him money

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:33.400
to have his first
group of slides made.

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:37.160
And then they actually
publicized his lectures

00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:39.090
in the area, in the
New York area.

00:58:39.090 --> 00:58:41.440
And the scrapbook shows
his going to Connecticut,

00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:44.120
he's going to New Jersey,
sometimes to Pennsylvania, and,

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.770
you know, very locally.

00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:49.150
But later, when he really
started lecturing his way

00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:52.570
to make money, that's when
he took these national tours,

00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:54.310
and he spent three or
four months on the road.

00:58:54.310 --> 00:58:57.630
And they'd be booked by
these lecture bureaus that --

00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:59.360
and he travelled everywhere.

00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:02.310
And one of the nice things in
the exhibition are the postcards

00:59:02.310 --> 00:59:05.740
that he sent home to his
daughter Katie that are

00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:08.680
from the Grand Canyon,
from the South,

00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:11.430
from the North, from
the Northwest.

00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:13.480
You know, he travelled
everywhere.

00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:14.920
And it's really extraordinary
to think

00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:16.220
about because this is the --

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:17.520
you know, this couldn't
have happened

00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:18.820
without the lantern slide

00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:20.920
and it couldn't have
happened without the train.

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:23.540
And one of the objects in
the exhibition that belongs

00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:25.120
to the Museum of the City
of New York that's here

00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:27.590
on view is his lantern
slide box.

00:59:27.590 --> 00:59:30.650
It's just a cardboard
box covered in canvas.

00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:33.500
And it's really,
really worn, you know.

00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:37.140
So he carried that box of
slides with him on the train,

00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:39.100
all over the country
several months a year.

00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:40.400
And he had a heart condition.

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:43.160
He had a pretty serious
heart attack when he was 60,

00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:45.460
and he was told to slow
down, and he didn't.

00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:50.370
And he continued, and he was
constantly going on tours

00:59:50.370 --> 00:59:55.440
at a sanitarium in --
I want to say Michigan.

00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:58.370
I'm -- Barbara, you probably
know better than I do.

00:59:58.370 --> 01:00:00.270
I can't remember.

01:00:00.270 --> 01:00:01.570
But, anyway.

01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:04.860
So he was constantly having
to be -- having a forced rest.

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:09.230
But he ended up dying
of a weak heart at 65.

01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:10.880
So he never stopped.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.180
But it was really just that --

01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:14.920
he did travel to Europe several
times, but his travelling

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.670
to Europe was more to see
his family in Denmark.

01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:20.760
And then he actually wrote a
tremendous amount about Denmark.

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:24.580
He wrote this crazy article
about Hamlet and Elsinore

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:27.170
and sort of saying because
there were all these --

01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:30.570
because, you know, it's like
the truth about Shakespeare

01:00:30.570 --> 01:00:34.110
in Elsinore, and he actually
went and found the documents

01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:38.400
in the local -- it's
a crazy story.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:43.050
He found the documents in the
local like City Hall that showed

01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:46.090
when Shakespeare actually
visited Elsinore in Denmark

01:00:46.090 --> 01:00:48.980
and then wrote this
article about it.

01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:51.730
And he has a photograph
there, which he didn't take,

01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:54.290
of Shakespeare's
tomb in Elsinore

01:00:54.290 --> 01:00:56.130
which he says this
is a total fake.

01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:58.410
It's there just for
the tourists.

01:00:58.410 --> 01:01:01.470
You know. So, I mean, he --
his travel in Europe was more

01:01:01.470 --> 01:01:04.910
like related to his
Danish identity,

01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:10.040
although he was very involved
with English -- with English --

01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:12.790
the English were very
progressive in terms

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:14.090
of social reform,

01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:17.100
and he sometimes mentions
efforts that were done there.

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:18.680
So he made an effort to be.

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:21.800
But, as far as I know, he
didn't give talks there.

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.100
Yes.

01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:24.530
&gt;&gt; In your talking
[inaudible] on [inaudible]

01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:33.490
of documenting poverty
in the slums [inaudible]?

01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:34.790
&gt;&gt; Bonnie Yochelson: Sure.

01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:36.090
Let's see, how do I do this?

01:01:36.090 --> 01:01:41.220
I mean, Riis took a
real hit in the 1890 --

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:45.540
in the 1990s, in the moment
of a sort of large attack

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:47.200
on the total humanist tradition

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.720
of documentary photography
saying

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:51.000
that photographers were
essentially making their own

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.170
reputations on the
backs of the poor.

01:01:54.170 --> 01:01:56.800
So, you know, Dorothea
Lang, Eugene Smith,

01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.260
a lot of these very famous
photographers were slammed hard,

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:02.650
and people turned to Riis
as like the beginning

01:02:02.650 --> 01:02:06.170
of that criticism, of the
beginning of the tradition

01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:09.040
that led to those photographers.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:12.760
And, of course, the slum tour.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.970
I mean, the name of his book,
<i>How The Other Half Lives </i>.

01:02:15.970 --> 01:02:17.950
I mean, talk about
the other, you know.

01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:20.400
I mean, he's identifying
from the get-go,

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:26.110
I am on one side describing
the poor to, you know,

01:02:26.110 --> 01:02:30.700
describing the other half
to the well-off half.

01:02:30.700 --> 01:02:33.430
I mean, that is the way
he frames that book.

01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:36.140
And so the book was
heavily criticized for that,

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:38.360
as well as the racial
stereotyping.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:45.030
What I found was that -- sort
of what my discovery was,

01:02:45.030 --> 01:02:48.790
all of that is true, you
know, about that first book.

01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:51.420
And that -- but then there
is that interesting shift

01:02:51.420 --> 01:02:54.880
in the use of the camera with,
you know, immediately, you know,

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:58.630
in 1891 when he starts
photographing for <i>Children</i>

01:02:58.630 --> 01:03:01.430
<i>of The Poor </i>he has
a completely different

01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:03.460
relationship and, as
I say, a relationship

01:03:03.460 --> 01:03:06.880
with his viewers that's very
personal and that's in line

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:11.070
with his writing which is,
in general, the storytelling.

01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:13.020
He abandons the slum
tour entirely

01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:14.390
after <i>How The Other
Half Lives </i>.

01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:16.870
And, as I say, the second
book, which is more sort

01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:24.290
of Marley sound in certain ways
was a complete flop as a book.

01:03:24.290 --> 01:03:26.850
So, you know, people were not
interested in really learning

01:03:26.850 --> 01:03:30.050
about the sentimental story
of Little Katie or, you know,

01:03:30.050 --> 01:03:34.130
Little Eddie, the peddler, or,
you know, or a Buffalo who,

01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:35.660
you know, was a shoeshine boy.

01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:40.060
These wonderful tales and
their portraits fill that book.

01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:43.370
And that didn't catch on
with the general public.

01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:45.620
And people actually
liked the slum tour.

01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:48.760
They wanted that sort of
peek-a-boo of the other half.

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:52.460
But that's what's wo
interesting about his --

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:56.110
the second best-seller
because that is really a

01:03:56.110 --> 01:03:57.410
contemporary view.

01:03:57.410 --> 01:03:59.690
When she tells his own
story, his own tell-all.

01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:03.110
I was a homeless, I was
a homeless immigrant.

01:04:03.110 --> 01:04:05.950
I got thrown out of a
police lodging house.

01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:07.650
That is so interesting.

01:04:07.650 --> 01:04:10.140
It's not really about
the photography anymore.

01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:14.100
But in terms of approach
to the subject of poverty,

01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.830
that's something that
is very much in line

01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:19.980
with more contemporary
ideas of, you know,

01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:22.490
of people representing
themselves.

01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:25.630
And I -- as opposed to
having other speak for them

01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:27.560
or others represent them.

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:31.250
And that is so interesting.

01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:32.840
I find that really fascinating.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:34.380
It's no longer really
about photography.

01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:37.020
It's just about
self-representation and how

01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:43.670
to affect people, how to
get people moved to care

01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:46.130
about the problems of the poor.

01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:49.850
And it may be, and this is like
totally armchair psychology

01:04:49.850 --> 01:04:53.490
on my part, but, you
know, by the time he wrote

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:54.790
that book he was famous.

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:57.300
By the time he wrote
that book he was friends

01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:59.470
with Teddy Roosevelt
in the White House.

01:04:59.470 --> 01:05:01.090
And only from that position

01:05:01.090 --> 01:05:05.520
of security was he
willing to tell that story.

01:05:05.520 --> 01:05:08.020
When he wrote <i>How The
Other Half Lives </i>,

01:05:08.020 --> 01:05:12.660
his social status was much less
clear and much less secure.

01:05:12.660 --> 01:05:17.650
And so by his identifying
himself in that earlier book as,

01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:21.540
well, I'm one of you, he doesn't
tell the tale that he stayed

01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:23.850
in a lodging house
in that, you know --

01:05:23.850 --> 01:05:26.390
and that he was thrown out on
the street in a lodging house.

01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:28.590
He didn't tell that story in
<i>How The Other Half Lives </i>.

01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:31.010
Rather, he says, oh, let me
tell you about the Chinese,

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:32.730
let me tell you about
the Jews, let me tell you

01:05:32.730 --> 01:05:36.250
about the Bohemians,
as a newspaper man,

01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:39.570
as someone who knows this
world through my work,

01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:41.460
not through my own experience.

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:43.910
So that's the kind
of shifts that I see

01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:45.460
that are really important.

01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:48.390
And, again, though, again and
again, I mean, when I give talks

01:05:48.390 --> 01:05:51.230
on the [inaudible]
show in New York,

01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:52.690
there was already
somebody saying, well,

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:54.610
wasn't he like a
bad guy, you know?

01:05:54.610 --> 01:05:57.260
Aren't these photographs
really unethical, you know?
