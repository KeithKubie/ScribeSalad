I think education must be the only

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240
I think education must be the only
 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.760
I think education must be the only
sector that hasn't already been

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770
sector that hasn't already been
 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.480
sector that hasn't already been
completely revolutionized by technology

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490
completely revolutionized by technology
 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.009
completely revolutionized by technology
you know I think about even how we do

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019
you know I think about even how we do
 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.680
you know I think about even how we do
our work within Teach for America or

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690
our work within Teach for America or
 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.349
our work within Teach for America or
teach for all now versus 10 years ago

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359
teach for all now versus 10 years ago
 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.640
teach for all now versus 10 years ago
and it's completely and totally

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650
and it's completely and totally
 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.650
and it's completely and totally
different just based on you know the

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660
different just based on you know the
 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.769
different just based on you know the
power of technology so there is no doubt

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779
power of technology so there is no doubt
 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.870
power of technology so there is no doubt
I mean we're not leveraging technology

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
I mean we're not leveraging technology
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.240
I mean we're not leveraging technology
in the way that we absolutely must if

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250
in the way that we absolutely must if
 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.950
in the way that we absolutely must if
we're going to ensure that kids truly

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960
we're going to ensure that kids truly
 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.560
we're going to ensure that kids truly
attain an excellent education given how

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570
attain an excellent education given how
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.110
attain an excellent education given how
far we need to go in that pursuit from

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120
far we need to go in that pursuit from
 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.150
far we need to go in that pursuit from
where we are right now and I think

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160
where we are right now and I think
 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.270
where we are right now and I think
there's so much the technology can do

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280
there's so much the technology can do
 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.220
there's so much the technology can do
you know we should be thinking about how

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230
you know we should be thinking about how
 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.799
you know we should be thinking about how
to use the gaming technology that is so

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809
to use the gaming technology that is so
 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.389
to use the gaming technology that is so
addictive for kids to good end for

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399
addictive for kids to good end for
 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.840
addictive for kids to good end for
educational purposes you know we can

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850
educational purposes you know we can
 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.790
educational purposes you know we can
with with you know we should be able to

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800
with with you know we should be able to
 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.819
with with you know we should be able to
do so much to get our teachers and our

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829
do so much to get our teachers and our
 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.630
do so much to get our teachers and our
parents and our kids all clear on you

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640
parents and our kids all clear on you
 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.729
parents and our kids all clear on you
know where kids are relative to where

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739
know where kids are relative to where
 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.830
know where kids are relative to where
they're supposed to be based on rigorous

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840
they're supposed to be based on rigorous
 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.810
they're supposed to be based on rigorous
standards so that I mean the most

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820
standards so that I mean the most
 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.550
standards so that I mean the most
powerful way that motivate a kid is to

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560
powerful way that motivate a kid is to
 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.710
powerful way that motivate a kid is to
tell them here's where you are against

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720
tell them here's where you are against
 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.570
tell them here's where you are against
where you're supposed to be like they

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580
where you're supposed to be like they
 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.100
where you're supposed to be like they
become obsessed with getting where

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110
become obsessed with getting where
 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.560
become obsessed with getting where
they're supposed to be parents are dying

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570
they're supposed to be parents are dying
 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.200
they're supposed to be parents are dying
for that information teachers themselves

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210
for that information teachers themselves
 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.749
for that information teachers themselves
would benefit a lot from you know better

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759
would benefit a lot from you know better
 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.490
would benefit a lot from you know better
information on that score and if we

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500
information on that score and if we
 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.230
information on that score and if we
could get that information all in the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240
could get that information all in the
 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.490
could get that information all in the
hands of all those folks at the same

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500
hands of all those folks at the same
 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.980
hands of all those folks at the same
time right there we would you know we

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
time right there we would you know we
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.420
time right there we would you know we
would improve a lot we should be

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430
would improve a lot we should be
 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.190
would improve a lot we should be
individualizing instruction like

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
individualizing instruction like
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.800
individualizing instruction like
utilizing that data to actually give

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810
utilizing that data to actually give
 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.230
utilizing that data to actually give
teachers the tools necessary to meet the

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240
teachers the tools necessary to meet the
 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.210
teachers the tools necessary to meet the
needs of a very diverse group of kids

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220
needs of a very diverse group of kids
 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.280
needs of a very diverse group of kids
which exists in every class so there's

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290
which exists in every class so there's
 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.319
which exists in every class so there's
just there's so much we need technology

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329
just there's so much we need technology
 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.749
just there's so much we need technology
to do at the same time you know I've

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759
to do at the same time you know I've
 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.050
to do at the same time you know I've
been somewhat disconcerted by some of

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060
been somewhat disconcerted by some of
 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.260
been somewhat disconcerted by some of
the discussion that goes on around

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270
the discussion that goes on around
 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.130
the discussion that goes on around
technology and education because it

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140
technology and education because it
 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.490
technology and education because it
almost you know and and this this seems

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500
almost you know and and this this seems
 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.520
almost you know and and this this seems
extreme but I've sat in rooms full of

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530
extreme but I've sat in rooms full of
 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.889
extreme but I've sat in rooms full of
folks who think that we could like give

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
folks who think that we could like give
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.929
folks who think that we could like give
kids tablets and that's it like they're

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939
kids tablets and that's it like they're
 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.169
kids tablets and that's it like they're
gonna teach themselves and I just think

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179
gonna teach themselves and I just think
 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.059
gonna teach themselves and I just think
in the end especially when you're

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069
in the end especially when you're
 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.370
in the end especially when you're
working with the most marginalized

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380
working with the most marginalized
 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.800
working with the most marginalized
kids the kids who are facing so many

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810
kids the kids who are facing so many
 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.590
kids the kids who are facing so many
extra challenges who don't have safety

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600
extra challenges who don't have safety
 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.150
extra challenges who don't have safety
nets they have the opposite of safety

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160
nets they have the opposite of safety
 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.640
nets they have the opposite of safety
nets around them you know I just think

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650
nets around them you know I just think
 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.320
nets around them you know I just think
it's gonna I don't think we're gonna be

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330
it's gonna I don't think we're gonna be
 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.070
it's gonna I don't think we're gonna be
able to replace just the the kind of

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080
able to replace just the the kind of
 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.930
able to replace just the the kind of
importance and power of personal

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940
importance and power of personal
 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.470
importance and power of personal
relationships you know whenever we've

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480
relationships you know whenever we've
 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.700
relationships you know whenever we've
seen the kids in the most kind of

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710
seen the kids in the most kind of
 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.430
seen the kids in the most kind of
disadvantaged context truly excel always

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440
disadvantaged context truly excel always
 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.860
disadvantaged context truly excel always
it's been in classrooms and in whole

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870
it's been in classrooms and in whole
 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.090
it's been in classrooms and in whole
schools where there is a clear vision of

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100
schools where there is a clear vision of
 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.710
schools where there is a clear vision of
where the kids have the potential to be

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720
where the kids have the potential to be
 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.810
where the kids have the potential to be
where there are people working

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820
where there are people working
 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.390
where there are people working
incredibly hard to convince the kids

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400
incredibly hard to convince the kids
 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.640
incredibly hard to convince the kids
that they can succeed if they work hard

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650
that they can succeed if they work hard
 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.260
that they can succeed if they work hard
enough and that it will make a

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270
enough and that it will make a
 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.520
enough and that it will make a
difference in their lives

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530
difference in their lives
 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.680
difference in their lives
you know there's so much that goes into

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690
you know there's so much that goes into
 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.730
you know there's so much that goes into
building a culture of achievement you

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740
building a culture of achievement you
 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.980
building a culture of achievement you
know and and there's a lot that that

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990
know and and there's a lot that that
 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.500
know and and there's a lot that that
goes on that could be you know better

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510
goes on that could be you know better
 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.270
goes on that could be you know better
done with technology as well you know

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280
done with technology as well you know
 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.890
done with technology as well you know
like if we if the teachers and the

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900
like if we if the teachers and the
 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.960
like if we if the teachers and the
principals in those schools how to

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970
principals in those schools how to
 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.270
principals in those schools how to
access to really great technology they

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280
access to really great technology they
 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.950
access to really great technology they
could no doubt speed up learning but I

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960
could no doubt speed up learning but I
 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.360
could no doubt speed up learning but I
just don't think we're gonna be able

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370
just don't think we're gonna be able
 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.970
just don't think we're gonna be able
what we need is all of that together you

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980
what we need is all of that together you
 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.250
what we need is all of that together you
know technology alone won't be the

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260
know technology alone won't be the
 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.340
know technology alone won't be the
panacea but if we can bring it to bear

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350
panacea but if we can bring it to bear
 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.520
panacea but if we can bring it to bear
within a context of all the foundations

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530
within a context of all the foundations
 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.700
within a context of all the foundations
that are important for quality education

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710
that are important for quality education
 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:38.060
that are important for quality education
it can be a huge accelerator
