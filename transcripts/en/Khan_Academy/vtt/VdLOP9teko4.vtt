00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.636
- [Voiceover] Hello, grammarians.

00:00:01.636 --> 00:00:03.762
Welcome to Irregular Plurals, Part IV.

00:00:04.284 --> 00:00:07.883
The Mutant Plurals. (moans)

00:00:09.288 --> 00:00:13.328
Yes friends, these words
have mutant superpowers

00:00:13.328 --> 00:00:16.161
in that they can transform weirdly

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:18.808
and obnoxiously, not
obeying any other rules

00:00:18.808 --> 00:00:20.248
of English pluralization.

00:00:20.393 --> 00:00:21.606
But here's the cool thing.

00:00:21.606 --> 00:00:24.520
There are only seven words
that behave this way.

00:00:24.836 --> 00:00:25.728
What way?

00:00:25.728 --> 00:00:27.574
I'll explain by writing all of them down.

00:00:27.574 --> 00:00:30.720
The words are foot,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.085
woman,

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:37.651
man,

00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:40.368
tooth,

00:00:40.368 --> 00:00:43.131
goose,

00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:46.080
mouse,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.122
louse.

00:00:49.122 --> 00:00:51.003
Looks pretty straightforward, right?

00:00:51.328 --> 00:00:52.883
The thing about these words is that none

00:00:52.883 --> 00:00:55.403
of them take s as a plural.

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:58.073
So the plural of foot is not foots,

00:00:58.073 --> 00:01:00.233
the plural of woman is not womans,

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:02.206
the plural of tooth is not tooths.

00:01:03.716 --> 00:01:06.119
The reason these are called mutant plurals

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.127
is because the vowel sound,

00:01:08.127 --> 00:01:10.240
the ooh, or the uh, or the ah, or the ooh,

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.050
or the ooh, or the ou,
or the ou, turns into

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.196
a different sound, turns
into a different vowel sound.

00:01:16.956 --> 00:01:20.329
So the plural of foot
is not foots, but feet.

00:01:21.328 --> 00:01:24.370
The plural of woman is
not womans, but women.

00:01:25.798 --> 00:01:29.246
The plural of man is not mans, but men.

00:01:29.878 --> 00:01:33.437
The plural of tooth is
not tooths, but teeth.

00:01:34.285 --> 00:01:37.210
The plural of goose is
not gooses, but geese.

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:42.284
The plural of mouse is
not mouses, but mice.

00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:48.405
And the plural of louse
is not louses, but lice.

00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:51.354
You can see that mouse and louse actually

00:01:51.354 --> 00:01:53.553
change their end spelling as well

00:01:53.553 --> 00:01:56.128
from se to ce.

00:01:56.604 --> 00:01:58.195
Even though it's the same sound,

00:01:58.195 --> 00:02:01.689
louse, lice, for whatever reason,

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.597
just from some quirk of our spelling history,

00:02:04.597 --> 00:02:06.484
not only do we change the vowels

00:02:06.484 --> 00:02:09.445
used here, we also change
the consonants you say.

00:02:10.478 --> 00:02:11.651
Why is this the case?

00:02:11.651 --> 00:02:12.846
I'm so glad you asked.

00:02:12.846 --> 00:02:14.611
I'm going to save that for another video.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.932
In the meantime, just these seven words.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.250
One, two, three, four, five,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.805
six, seven, are the only

00:02:24.805 --> 00:02:26.964
words in English that behave this way.

00:02:27.224 --> 00:02:28.404
So you're in luck.

00:02:28.404 --> 00:02:30.761
This is a handful of words to memorize.

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:33.326
And provided you're not borrowing any one

00:02:33.326 --> 00:02:36.008
else' hats, ideally
you won't have to worry

00:02:36.008 --> 00:02:37.529
about lice very often.

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:38.861
That's my hope.

00:02:38.861 --> 00:02:40.181
You can learn anything.

00:02:40.181 --> 00:02:40.912
David out.
