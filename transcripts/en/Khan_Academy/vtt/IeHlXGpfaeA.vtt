00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.052
- [Instructor] Estimating
e to the 1.45 using

00:00:02.052 --> 00:00:04.782
a Taylor polynomial about x equals two,

00:00:04.782 --> 00:00:07.164
what is the least degree of the polynomial

00:00:07.164 --> 00:00:10.581
that assures an error smaller than 0.001?

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:13.957
In general, if you see
a situation like this

00:00:13.957 --> 00:00:16.342
where we're talking about
approximating a function

00:00:16.342 --> 00:00:19.082
with a Taylor polynomial
centered about some value,

00:00:19.082 --> 00:00:21.095
and we wanna know, well,
how many terms do we need,

00:00:21.095 --> 00:00:23.750
what degree do we need to bound the error?

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.424
That's a pretty good clue
that we're going to be using

00:00:26.424 --> 00:00:29.880
the LaGrange error bound or
Taylor's remainder theorem.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.861
And just as a reminder of that,

00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:35.119
this is a review of
Taylor's remainder theorem,

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:38.080
and it tells us that the
absolute value of the remainder

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.169
for the nth degree Taylor polynomial,

00:00:40.169 --> 00:00:43.309
it's gonna be less than this
business right over here.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.527
Now, n is the degree of our polynomial

00:00:46.527 --> 00:00:49.075
that in question, so that's the n.

00:00:49.075 --> 00:00:52.915
The x is the x value at which
we are calculating that error,

00:00:52.915 --> 00:00:55.544
in this case it's going to be this 1.45.

00:00:55.544 --> 00:00:58.343
And c is where our Taylor
polynomial is centered.

00:00:58.343 --> 00:00:59.775
But what about our M?

00:00:59.775 --> 00:01:02.837
Well, our M is an upper
bound on the absolute value

00:01:02.837 --> 00:01:06.470
of the n plus oneth
derivative of our function.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:07.779
And that might seem like a mouthful,

00:01:07.779 --> 00:01:09.262
but when we actually
work through the details

00:01:09.262 --> 00:01:12.208
of this example, it'll make
it a little bit more concrete.

00:01:12.208 --> 00:01:14.813
So for this particular thing,
we're trying to estimate,

00:01:14.813 --> 00:01:17.460
we're trying to estimate e to the x.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.255
So I could write f of x,
let me write this this way.

00:01:21.255 --> 00:01:24.338
So, f of x is equal to e to the x,

00:01:25.631 --> 00:01:29.577
and we're trying to estimate f of 1.45.

00:01:29.577 --> 00:01:31.949
And let's just to get the bound here,

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:34.279
to figure out what M is,
let's just remind ourselves

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:36.263
that while the first derivative of this

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:37.537
is going to be e to the x,

00:01:37.537 --> 00:01:38.934
the second derivative
is gonna be e to the x,

00:01:38.934 --> 00:01:41.355
the nth derivative is gonna be e to the x,

00:01:41.355 --> 00:01:43.988
the n plus oneth derivative
is gonna be e to the x.

00:01:43.988 --> 00:01:48.621
So the n plus oneth
derivative of f is gonna be,

00:01:48.621 --> 00:01:49.538
is gonna be

00:01:50.787 --> 00:01:53.524
e to the x which is convenient.

00:01:53.524 --> 00:01:55.439
These types of problems
are very, very hard

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.910
if it's difficult to bound
the n plus oneth derivative.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.968
Well this we know, we know that e the x,

00:02:03.968 --> 00:02:05.765
we know that e the x, and I can even say

00:02:05.765 --> 00:02:08.219
the absolute value of this,
but this is gonna be positive,

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:10.500
is going to be less than or equal to,

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.000
let's say this is gonna be
less than or equal to e squared

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.917
for zero is less than x

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.655
is less than or equal to two.

00:02:22.655 --> 00:02:25.771
e the x isn't bounded over the entire,

00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:28.604
for over its entire domain.

00:02:28.604 --> 00:02:29.533
If x goes to infinity,

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:31.498
e to the x will also go to infinity.

00:02:31.498 --> 00:02:33.031
But here I set up an interval.

00:02:33.031 --> 00:02:35.685
I've set up an interval that
contains the x we care about.

00:02:35.685 --> 00:02:38.505
Remember, the x we care about is 1.45,

00:02:38.505 --> 00:02:42.541
and it also contains where
our function is centered.

00:02:42.541 --> 00:02:44.190
Our function is centered at two.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.099
So we know we're bounded by e squared,

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.374
so we can say, we can
use e squared as our M.

00:02:50.374 --> 00:02:52.667
We can use e squared as our M.

00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:55.355
We're able to establish this bound.

00:02:55.355 --> 00:02:57.969
And so doing that, we can now go straight

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.327
to LaGrange error bound.

00:02:59.327 --> 00:03:03.177
We can say, we can say that the remainder

00:03:03.177 --> 00:03:05.255
of our nth degree Taylor polynomial,

00:03:05.255 --> 00:03:06.315
we wanna solve for n.

00:03:06.315 --> 00:03:10.602
We wanna figure out what n
gives us the appropriate bound

00:03:10.602 --> 00:03:12.102
evaluated at 1.45.

00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:17.447
When x is 1.45 is going to
be less than or equal to

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:21.192
the absolute value, our M is e squared,

00:03:21.192 --> 00:03:22.442
e squared over,

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:27.020
over n plus one factorial times

00:03:29.911 --> 00:03:32.609
1.45, that's our x that we care about,

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:33.926
that's where we're calculating the error,

00:03:33.926 --> 00:03:35.287
we're trying to bound the error,

00:03:35.287 --> 00:03:37.016
minus where we're centered,

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:40.616
minus two to the n plus oneth power.

00:03:40.616 --> 00:03:42.199
Now 1.45 minus two,

00:03:44.225 --> 00:03:46.214
that is negative 0.55.

00:03:46.214 --> 00:03:47.815
So let me just write that.

00:03:47.815 --> 00:03:48.732
So this is,

00:03:49.658 --> 00:03:51.408
this is negative 0.55

00:03:53.572 --> 00:03:56.095
to the n plus oneth power.

00:03:56.095 --> 00:03:59.929
And we wanna figure out for
what n is all of this business,

00:03:59.929 --> 00:04:04.012
is all of this business
gonna be less than 0.001.

00:04:05.012 --> 00:04:07.941
Well let's do a little bit of
algebraic manipulation here.

00:04:07.941 --> 00:04:11.054
This term is positive,
this is gonna be positive.

00:04:11.054 --> 00:04:13.155
This right over here, or this part of it,

00:04:13.155 --> 00:04:14.675
it's not an independent term,

00:04:14.675 --> 00:04:16.643
but the e to the squared
is gonna be positive,

00:04:16.643 --> 00:04:18.173
n plus one factorial is gonna be positive,

00:04:18.173 --> 00:04:20.621
the negative 0.55 to some power,

00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:23.225
that's gonna flip between
being positive or negative.

00:04:23.225 --> 00:04:25.035
But since we're taking the absolute value,

00:04:25.035 --> 00:04:26.530
we could write it this way.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.613
We could write e squared,

00:04:30.385 --> 00:04:34.983
e squared, since we're taking
the absolute value times 0.55

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:38.566
to the n plus one over
n plus one factorial

00:04:40.837 --> 00:04:44.754
has to be less than, has
to be less than 0.001.

00:04:46.277 --> 00:04:49.027
Or, since we want to solve for n,

00:04:50.146 --> 00:04:52.790
let's divide both sides by e squared.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.707
So we could write, we could write,

00:04:55.707 --> 00:04:57.957
let's find the n where 0.55

00:05:00.073 --> 00:05:02.950
to the n plus oneth power

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.033
over n plus one factorial

00:05:07.072 --> 00:05:08.155
is less than,

00:05:09.164 --> 00:05:10.664
is less than 0.001

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.270
over e squared.

00:05:16.904 --> 00:05:20.309
Now to play with this, we're
gonna have to use a calculator.

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:23.772
From this point we're just
gonna try larger and larger ns

00:05:23.772 --> 00:05:26.178
until we get an n that makes this true.

00:05:26.178 --> 00:05:28.876
And we wanna find the smallest possible n

00:05:28.876 --> 00:05:30.306
that makes this true.

00:05:30.306 --> 00:05:32.905
But let's get out our calculators
so that we can actually,

00:05:32.905 --> 00:05:35.371
so that we can actually do this.

00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:37.112
So, first I'm just gonna figure out

00:05:37.112 --> 00:05:40.454
what is 1/1000 divided by e squared.

00:05:40.454 --> 00:05:42.835
So make sure it's cleared out.

00:05:42.835 --> 00:05:44.895
So let's take e squared,

00:05:44.895 --> 00:05:46.931
I'm gonna take its reciprocal,

00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:49.215
and then I'm gonna
multiply that times 1/1000.

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:51.382
So times .001 is equal to,

00:05:54.526 --> 00:05:55.693
so it's about,

00:05:56.907 --> 00:05:58.242
so I'll say,

00:05:58.242 --> 00:06:01.056
so it's three zeroes, this is a 10/1000,

00:06:01.056 --> 00:06:02.239
and then three five.

00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:05.166
So it's three zeroes, so
I'll say one three six.

00:06:05.166 --> 00:06:09.333
So this needs to be less than
zero point one two three,

00:06:11.131 --> 00:06:13.216
then I'll say one three six.

00:06:13.216 --> 00:06:16.693
If I can find an n that is less than this,

00:06:16.693 --> 00:06:18.567
then I'm in, then I am in good shape.

00:06:18.567 --> 00:06:19.443
Actually let me say this.

00:06:19.443 --> 00:06:22.454
Less than one three five, I
wanna be less than that value,

00:06:22.454 --> 00:06:25.120
then I can be, then I
will be in good shape.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:28.482
This is a little bit
more than one three five,

00:06:28.482 --> 00:06:31.347
but if I can find an n where
that is less than this,

00:06:31.347 --> 00:06:33.063
then I'm in good shape.

00:06:33.063 --> 00:06:36.646
So let me write this
0.55 to the n plus one

00:06:37.976 --> 00:06:40.143
over n plus one factorial.

00:06:41.555 --> 00:06:43.116
So let's try out some ns.

00:06:43.116 --> 00:06:45.748
And I'm gonna have to
get my calculator out.

00:06:45.748 --> 00:06:48.064
So, let's see, did I do that right?

00:06:48.064 --> 00:06:49.231
Yeah, .000135.

00:06:51.429 --> 00:06:54.396
If we get something below
this, then we're in good shape,

00:06:54.396 --> 00:06:57.467
because this is even less than that.

00:06:57.467 --> 00:06:59.257
All right, so let's do it.

00:06:59.257 --> 00:07:01.316
Let's see what this is equal to

00:07:01.316 --> 00:07:03.576
when, I don't know,
when n is equal to two.

00:07:03.576 --> 00:07:07.743
I can start at n equals one,
n equals two, n equals three,

00:07:08.764 --> 00:07:10.682
but if n equals two is good enough,

00:07:10.682 --> 00:07:12.520
then I might try n equals one.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.982
But if n equals two isn't good enough,

00:07:13.982 --> 00:07:16.247
then I'm gonna go to n equals
three or n equals four.

00:07:16.247 --> 00:07:17.418
So let's start with,

00:07:17.418 --> 00:07:19.233
actually let's just start
with n equals three.

00:07:19.233 --> 00:07:22.573
So if n equals three, it's gonna
be 0.55 to the fourth power

00:07:22.573 --> 00:07:24.112
divided by four factorial.

00:07:24.112 --> 00:07:25.816
So let's use that, let's do that.

00:07:25.816 --> 00:07:26.649
So 0.55

00:07:28.945 --> 00:07:31.945
to the fourth power is equal to that

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.079
divided by four factorial.

00:07:37.079 --> 00:07:39.996
So divided by four factorial is 24.

00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:44.784
So that's nowhere near low enough.

00:07:45.878 --> 00:07:47.993
So let's try n equals four.

00:07:47.993 --> 00:07:50.917
If n equals four, then it's
gonna be this to the fifth power

00:07:50.917 --> 00:07:52.942
divided by five factorial.

00:07:52.942 --> 00:07:53.775
So 0.55

00:07:56.638 --> 00:07:59.862
to the fifth power is equal to,

00:07:59.862 --> 00:08:02.584
and then divided by five factorial is,

00:08:02.584 --> 00:08:04.963
five factorial is 120.

00:08:04.963 --> 00:08:07.630
Divided by 120 is equal to that.

00:08:08.744 --> 00:08:11.924
We're almost there with n equals four.

00:08:11.924 --> 00:08:14.603
I'm guessing that n equals
five will do the trick.

00:08:14.603 --> 00:08:18.227
So for n equals five,
let's clear this out.

00:08:18.227 --> 00:08:21.331
So for n equals five, we're
gonna raise to the sixth power

00:08:21.331 --> 00:08:23.498
and divide by six factorial.

00:08:23.498 --> 00:08:24.797
And so let's just remind ourselves

00:08:24.797 --> 00:08:27.631
what six factorial is, 720.

00:08:27.631 --> 00:08:29.286
In fact, I could've done that in my head.

00:08:29.286 --> 00:08:30.230
But anyway.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:31.238
All right, so let's see.

00:08:31.238 --> 00:08:35.729
We're gonna go 0.55 to
the, remember, n is five,

00:08:35.729 --> 00:08:37.596
so we're gonna raise to the sixth power,

00:08:37.596 --> 00:08:39.601
to the sixth power,

00:08:39.601 --> 00:08:42.084
and then we're gonna divide by 720,

00:08:42.084 --> 00:08:44.334
divided by 720 is equal to,

00:08:45.605 --> 00:08:48.175
and this number for sure is less than

00:08:48.175 --> 00:08:49.831
this number right over here.

00:08:49.831 --> 00:08:53.325
We've got four zeroes before
this three after the decimal,

00:08:53.325 --> 00:08:54.996
here we only have three.

00:08:54.996 --> 00:08:59.205
So when n equals five, it got
us sufficiently low enough,

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:02.242
this remainder is going
to be sufficiently low,

00:09:02.242 --> 00:09:04.942
it's gonna be less than
this value right over here.

00:09:04.942 --> 00:09:07.934
So, what is the least
degree of the polynomial

00:09:07.934 --> 00:09:12.255
that assures an error smaller than 1/1000?

00:09:12.255 --> 00:09:16.239
The answer is five, our n, if n is five,

00:09:16.239 --> 00:09:18.877
we're definitely gonna be under this.
