00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.220
And people who were working in tumor
systems also made the similar

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.109
observation that PD-1 is a major target
on the TILs - these tumor infiltrating lymphocytes

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.820
that get into the tumor but
cannot kill the tumor -- have very high

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.400
levels of PD-1. Then there was a lot of
interest in extending these in vivo

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.439
experiments to from mice into non-human
primates and so on. And so on so actually we did a

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.600
study with Rama Amara, who's also a
faculty member at Emory Vaccine Center,

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.640
and Rama showed that if you give an
infusion of this blocking antibody to

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.980
monkeys that were infected with SIV - 
SIV stands for Simian Immunodeficiency Virus,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.770
it's a cousin of HIV and basically it's
the HIV virus of monkeys -- and what Rama

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.559
and his group showed is that
if you block anti- PD-1 PDL1

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.789
interaction non-human primates you get
an increase in the function of the SIV

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.920
specific T-cells and a reduction of the
virus in these in these monkeys.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.170
In collaboration we did with with a group
in Ohio with Chris Walker,

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.610
we showed the same thing in the HCV
model of chimpanzees. That's really the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.560
only model for HCV that that can be don.
And then Chris showed the same thing

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.840
happening in HC- infected chimpanzees.
And as I mentioned, a lot of people

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.979
working in tumor models showed the same thing.
And then what has been quite

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.049
amazing to see is the very, very
rapid advances that have happened in

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.909
terms of clinical trials of PD-1
in cancer patients. This of course is not

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.070
our work it's -- we don't work on in
cancer models, we actually never even

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.079
worked on in a mouse cancer model, okay,
but the real benefit of PD-1, and the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.060
progress has been quite remarkable, 
has happened in the last four three or four years

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.579
and these studies have been led by
many major pharmaceutical industries,

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:10.170
three in particular Merck, Bristol-Myers
Squibb and Genentech. These three big

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.860
pharmaceutical companies have developed anti PD-1 antibodies

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.660
and also anti PDL1 antibodies. I told
you both in effect do the same thing,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.980
they block this inhibitory interaction
and release the brake on the t-cell.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.160
And the results have been quite promising.
PD-1 blockade has been shown to be

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.290
effective in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials for multiple

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.690
different cancers, in particular for
melanoma and for lung cancer.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.780
In particular lung cancer really had hardly
any therapy was there. In terms of

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.280
chemotherapy, all of that was really not
not that effective, but depending on

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.110
the PD-1 has given promising results
in 15 to 20% of the treated people.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.770
There's not a very large number, but
when you go from basically no survival

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.430
to zero percent survival to 15 to 20
percent, there's really quite a dramatic

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.720
change in in the treatment of cancer. 
And within three or four years of these

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.560
human clinical trials starting both
Merck and BMS have a licensed drug.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.840
So PD-1 was licensed last year (2015) for melanoma treatment, actually a year-and-a-half back

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.299
for melanoma and last year (2015) also for lung.
So this has been quite remarkable

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:39.420
to see and I give this as an example for
how science should be done.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.480
When we first started this path down this path
many years ago, 25-30 years ago,

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.110
really our interest was very simple. We asked
how do you maintain T-cell memory long term?

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.190
We were not thinking of cancer
we were not thinking of immune therapy.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.310
That was completely off 
our radar, but these

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.830
fundamental studies on understanding 
T-cell memory led to T-cell exhaustion,

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.100
the t-cell exhaustion led to the linking of
PD-1 with T-cell exhaustion and then a

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.600
potential therapy for the rescue of
those exhausted cells, and that has very

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.340
quickly worked, and the credit 
for this goes to the

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.270
oncologists who do these clinical trials
and different places, these companies,

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.280
to move things ,forward very quickly,
but essentially you now have

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.530
drugs which are effective in treating
melanoma and also

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.989
in treating lung cancer.
