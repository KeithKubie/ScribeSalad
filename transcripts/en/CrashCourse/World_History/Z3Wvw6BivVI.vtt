Hi there, my name’s John Green and this is Crash Course: World History, and today we’re going to talk about Egypt.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.200
No, not that Egypt.
Older.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.480
Older.
Older.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.380
Less fictional.
Yes, that one.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.400
Ancient Egypt is probably the most influential
of the river valley civilizations.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.840
Like you might not recognize any Assyrian Kings or Assyrian language, but you probably do know King Tut.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.920
And you may recognize that the Eye of Horus
is right now staring at me and judging me.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.930
I can feel, I can feel your judgement.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.880
[Theme Music]

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.840
When we think of Ancient Civilizations, we
think of Egypt.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.720
There are a few reasons for this, like the fact that the pyramids are the last man standing among the Seven Ancient Wonders of the World.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:53.720
But more importantly, Ancient Egyptian civilization lasted from 3000 BCE to 332 BCE.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.000
That’s a period that historians call a long-ass time.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.600
And I will remind you it is not cursing
if I'm talking about donkeys.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.780
So there are many approaches to the study
of history. You could view history as a millennial

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.710
long conversation about philosophy or as clashes
between great men or you can see history through

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.580
the lens of traditionally neglected populations,
like women or indigenous peoples or slaves.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.970
And we’re going to try to take many approaches
to our study of history during Crash Course.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.040
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, which approach is right?
I mean, for the test.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.420
Oh me-from-the-past. Remember how you spent
all of third year French writing notes back

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.710
and forth to that girl and she eventually
agreed to go out with you and you did make

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.189
it to second base but now you can hardly parle
un mot de francais?

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.229
Historical lenses are like that, my friend: With every
choice, something is gained and something is lost.

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.509
Right, so in discussing agriculture and early
civilizations, we’ve been approaching history

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.460
through the lens of resource distribution
and geography.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.610
And just as the violent and capricious Tigris
and Euphrates rivers shaped the worldview

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.189
of early Mesopotamians, the Nile shaped the world
view of the Egyptians. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.369
The Nile was regular, navigable, and benign,
making for one of the safest and richest agricultural

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.170
areas in the world. Each summer the river
flooded the fields at precisely the right

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.920
time, leaving behind nutrient-rich silt for
planting season.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.190
Planting was so easy that Egyptians just tossed
seeds around the silty earth and then let

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.470
their cattle or pigs walk on it to press the
seeds into the ground, and then boom, grain

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.680
and figs and wheat and pomegranates and melons
and joy.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.379
Unlike most river valley civilizations, Egyptian
communities existed ONLY along the Nile, which

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:36.399
was navigable enough to get valuable resources
downstream from timber to gold, which the Egyptians

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.900
considered the divine metal, thereby introducing
an idea that would eventually culminate in Mr. T.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.400
The Nile is also easily tamed. While other
river valley civilizations needed complicated

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.300
and labor-intensive hydraulic engineering
projects to irrigate crops, the Nile was so

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.989
chill that Egyptians could use a simple form
of water management called basin irrigation,

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.120
in which farmers used floodwaters to fill
earthen basins and canals for irrigation.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.340
In short, the awesomeness of the Nile meant
Egyptians could create big food surpluses

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.319
with relatively little work, allowing time
and energy for some pretty impressive projects.

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.010
Also, the Nile may help explain the ancient
Egypt’s general optimism:

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.879
While ancient Sumerian religion, for instance,
saw the afterlife as this gloomy, dark place,

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.349
Egyptians were often buried with things that
were useful and pleasurable to them in life,

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.040
because the Afterlife was seen as a continuation
of this life, which, at least if you lived

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.980
along the Nile, wasn’t half-bad.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.550
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.710
And now, my dear pupils, I shall terrorize
you with the oppression of dates. No. Dates.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.480
Yes. Thank you.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.629
Historians have divided Egyptian history into
three broad categories. Each with their own

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.700
numbered dynasties. But only hardcore Egyptologists
know the dynasties, and we’re not trying

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.450
to become hardcore Egyptologists.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.760
The Old Kingdom lasted from 2649 to 2152;

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.760
The middle kingdom from 2040 to 1640;

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.460
And the New Kingdom, so called because it
is only 3,000 years old, lasted from 1550-1070 BCE.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.450
In between you have a couple so-called Intermediate
periods. Okay, OLD KINGDOM.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.080
This was really the glory age of ancient Egypt,
when we get all the stuff that will later

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.800
make Indiana Jones possible, like the pyramids at Giza, and the sun king Ra, and the idea of divine kingship.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.099
The king, or Pharoh, was either a god or very close to a god.

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.680
which seems like a good gig, except that it
meant that he wasn’t expected to act like

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.479
a person, he was expected to act like a god,
which in ancient Egypt means acting like the

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:30.639
Nile: calm, cool, benevolent...
There’s no fun it that.

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.400
And then of course there are the pyramids,
which aside from remaining impressive to behold

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.639
represent a remarkable degree of political
and social control over the population, because

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.839
it is not easy to convince people to devote
their lives to building a sarcophagus for someone else.

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:48.990
The most famous pyramids were built between
2575 and 2465 BCE.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.259
The one with the Sphinx was for Khephren;

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.499
the largest, the Great Pyramid, was built
for the Pharaoh Khufu.

00:04:54.499 --> 00:04:58.719
These pyramids were built partly by peasants
who were required by Egyptian law to work

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:01.149
for the government a certain number of months
per year,

00:05:01.149 --> 00:05:05.309
and partly by slaves, but not by Moses and
the Jews, who showed up on the scene long

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:08.960
before pyramids were ever even a twinkle in
Khufu’s eye.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:15.960
This leads to an overwhelming question: Why?
Why in the sweet name of Ra would anyone ever

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.399
build such a thing?

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:21.330
Well, let’s start with Ra. So, Ra started
out as a regional god, reigning over Heliopolis,

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.559
but he eventually became really central to
the entire pantheon of gods of ancient Egypt.

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:28.369
He was the god of the sun, but also the god
of creation.

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:32.029
And the thinking was that if humans did their
jobs then the pantheon of gods would maintain

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:38.119
cosmic order, and since the pharaohs became
gods upon their death, it made sense to please

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:40.610
them even unto pyramids.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.809
Egyptian popular religion also embraced the
belief in amulets and magic and divination

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:46.559
and the belief that certain animals--

00:05:46.559 --> 00:05:49.449
especially cats—had divine power.

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.139
And yes, I did bring that up just so I could
lolcat.

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:54.129
Old Kingdom Egypt was also remarkably literate:

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:58.270
They had two forms of writing, hieroglyphics
for sacred writing and then demotic script

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.849
for recording contracts and agreements and
other boring stuff.

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:05.499
The last thing I want to say about Old Kingdom
Egypt; it was ridiculously rich.

00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:10.099
But then around 2250 BCE there were a series
of droughts and Pharaohs started fighting

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.839
over who should have power and we had an intermediate
period.

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:16.020
[classic intermission music]

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:18.589
Which was followed by the Middle Earth...

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:24.679
No, what? The middle kingdom? Ohh. Really?
That’s a bummer, Stan. I want it to be the

00:06:24.679 --> 00:06:28.779
Middle Earth. How awesome would that be? Like
right in the middle of Egyptian history, there

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:29.529
were Hobbits....

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:34.289
So the Middle Kingdom, which apparently had
no Hobbits, restored Pharaonic rule in 2040

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:36.490
BCE but with some distinct changes:

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:41.499
First, the rulers were outsiders, from downriver
in Nubia. Second, they fostered a new pantheon

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:45.319
of gods, the star of which was Ammun, which
means hidden.

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:49.959
So here’s a little lesson from history: Hidden
gods tend to do well because they’re omnipresent.

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:54.800
So Ammun eventually merged with Ra to form
the god Ammun-Ra, who was like the best god ever

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:01.179
and all the Middle Kingdom pharaohs made temples
for him and devoted all of their surplus to his glory.

00:07:01.179 --> 00:07:05.469
The Middle Kingdom also developed an interest
in conquering, specifically the new homeland

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:10.149
of Nubia, and they developed a side interest
in getting conquered, specifically by Semitic

00:07:10.149 --> 00:07:11.589
peoples from the Levant.

00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:15.959
They were able to conquer much of Egypt using
superior military technology like bronze weapons

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:21.529
and compound bows, and chariots of fire. What?
They were just regular chariots? STAN WHY

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:23.749
ARE YOU ALWATS KILLING MY DREAMS?

00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:28.429
One group, the Hyksos, were able to conquer
all of Egypt, but rather than like destroying

00:07:28.429 --> 00:07:33.719
the Egyptian culture, they just relaxed like
the Nile and assimilated into the Egyptians.

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:38.399
And the Egyptians adopted their military technology.
And then the Egyptians destroyed the Hyksos

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:39.779
and expelled them from Egypt.

00:07:39.779 --> 00:07:43.779
And then by 1550 BCE there was again an Egyptian
pharaoh, Ahmosis...

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:45.959
...whose name only sounds like an STD.

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:50.179
Anyway, after all this conquering and being
conquered, Egypt eventually emerged from its

00:07:50.179 --> 00:07:53.959
geographically imposed isolationism and, can
you cue the New Kingdom Graphic please?

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.080
There it is!

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.620
New Kingdom Egypt continued this military
expansion but it looked more like an Empire,

00:07:58.629 --> 00:08:03.949
particularly when they headed south and took
over land in an attempt to find gold and slaves.

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:08.110
Probably the most expansive of the New Kingdom
pharaohs was Hatshepsut, a woman who ruled

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.089
Egypt for about 22 years.

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:14.020
And who expanded Egypt not through military
might, but through trade.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:18.339
But most new kingdom pharaohs being dudes,
focused on military expansion, which brought

00:08:18.339 --> 00:08:22.110
Egypt into conflicts with the Assyrians who
you’ll remember from last week,

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:25.399
And then the Persians, and then Alexander
the Great and finally, the Romans.

00:08:25.399 --> 00:08:29.709
On the whole, Egypt probably would’ve been
better off enjoying its geographical isolation

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:34.560
and not trying to conquer new territory, but
all of Egypt’s friends had jumped off a bridge, so…

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.700
One last thing about the New Kingdom. There
was this crazy New Kingdom Pharaoh named Akehenaten,

00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:42.169
who tried to invent a new god for Egypt, Aten.

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:46.129
Akehenaten was kind of the Kim Jong Il of
Ancient Egypt, like he had this feared police

00:08:46.129 --> 00:08:50.160
force and this big cult of personality. And
also he was a nut job.

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.209
Anyway, after his death he was replaced by
his wife, and then a daughter and than a son,

00:08:55.209 --> 00:09:01.440
Tutankaten, who turned his back on the weird
god Aten and changed his name to Tutankhamen.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.629
And that is about all King Tut did before
he died...

00:09:04.629 --> 00:09:09.470
...probably around the age of 17. Honestly,
the only reason King Tut is famous is that

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:15.019
most Pharaohs had their graves robbed by ancient
people; and King Tut had his grave robbed

00:09:15.019 --> 00:09:16.829
by 20th century British people.

00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:18.789
Which brings us to the Open Letter.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.420
An Open Letter to King Tut:

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:29.740
Oh, but first we gotta find out what Stan
left for me in the Secret Compartment. It’s a pen.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.540
AAHHHH!! It’s a shock
pen! Stan?%@#

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:37.440
That’s a terrible, terrible gift for the
secret compartment.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:42.900
Dear King Tut, I know that as Pharaohs lives go, yours
was pretty poor. First, you had to marry your

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:46.870
sister, which hopefully you weren’t that
psyched about, plus you had a cleft palette

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.040
and probably scoliosis.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.980
Plus you died before really reaching adulthood.
But dude, you have had the best afterlife ever.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:59.019
Since your body was discovered in 1922, you’ve
become probably the most famous ancient person.

00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:03.459
There have been lots of books about you, scholars
have devoted their lives to you.

00:10:03.459 --> 00:10:06.740
Dude, we’re so obsessed with you that we
used this fancy new technology to scan your

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:11.509
body and establish that you probably died
of an infected broken leg and/or malaria,

00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:16.069
So you’ve inspired such seminal works of
art as the Discovery Kids series Tutenstein,

00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:17.760
which my son forces me to watch.

00:10:17.769 --> 00:10:22.360
Your relics have been to six continents! So
it all works out in the end, man.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.020
Well, I mean, you’re still dead. So that’s
kinda sucks.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.800
Best wishes,
John Green

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.470
King Tut leads us nicely to the really crucial
thing about Egyptian culture.

00:10:31.470 --> 00:10:34.939
Because King Tut lived right around the same
time as the pyramids right? Wrong.

00:10:34.939 --> 00:10:41.360
Remember the pyramids were built around 2500
BCE during the Old Kingdom. King Tut died

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.540
in 1322 BCE, 1200 years later!

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:50.319
That’s five and a half Americas. But because
Egypt was so similar for so long, it all tends

00:10:50.319 --> 00:10:52.879
to blend together when we imagine it.

00:10:52.879 --> 00:10:57.329
Ancient Egypt lasted 1000 years longer than
Christianity has been around, and about 800

00:10:57.329 --> 00:11:00.779
years longer than that other super-long lived
civilization, China.

00:11:00.779 --> 00:11:05.810
So there was an entire culture that lasted
longer than Western Civilization has existed

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.800
and it had run its course before “the West”
was even born.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:14.990
Next week, we’ll look at the Persians and
the Greeks. I’ll see you then.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.040
our graphics team is Thought Bubble.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.439
Last week’s phrase of the week was “Male
Models.” You can take your guess at this

00:11:28.439 --> 00:11:32.720
week’s phrase of the week in Comments and
also suggest future phrases of the week.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.490
And if you have any questions about today’s
video, leave them in Comments and our team

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:40.649
of semi-professional quasi-historians will
endeavor to answer them as best we can.

00:11:40.649 --> 00:11:44.249
Thanks for watching and as we say in my hometown:
Don’t forget to be awesome.
