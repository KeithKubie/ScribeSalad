[Android Developer Story]

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:07.245
[RogerVoice]
[DEVELOPING ON ANDROID FIRST]

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:09.982
I grew up with over 80% hearing lose,

00:00:09.982 --> 00:00:12.506
but that hasn't stopped me from
doing so many things in my life.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.550
Being an entrepreneur I'm use to having a sense

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.256
of freedom in doing what I want.

00:00:17.778 --> 00:00:19.620
And I knew that I could do something about

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.317
accessibility in telecommunications for deaf people.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.808
RogerVoice is an APP that allows deaf people

00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:26.100
to make phone calls.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:27.413
The notion is quite simple.

00:00:27.413 --> 00:00:29.770
You're trying to use voice recognition

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.665
to capture the other person's voice,

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:33.873
so that I can read what you are saying.

00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:36.299
It's not like I was looking for solutions.

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:38.388
I was just looking for something to help me.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.405
When I realized there was
something much more to it,

00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:44.170
I knew right away that I had to make this happen

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.256
for a lot of other people.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.933
My goal is to make it as
accessible as possible to everybody.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.283
I knew that Android had the way to reach each other.

00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:54.222
Over one billion users today, which is massive.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.300
And the fact that Android had like no constraints,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.522
I didn't have to ask myself it this was possible

00:00:59.522 --> 00:01:01.100
or not possible, I could just do it,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.914
so that was a deciding factor.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.245
I had no skills to start with.

00:01:05.245 --> 00:01:07.123
I couldn't code. I couldn't design.

00:01:07.593 --> 00:01:09.603
I had to find people, find skills.

00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:13.484
It's at that point where you
realize you can do a lot of things,

00:01:13.484 --> 00:01:15.217
but needed all of these connections

00:01:15.217 --> 00:01:16.777
around you to make it happen.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.869
When Olivier came to me, the first thing we did

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:21.773
was rethinking the navigation.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.239
And here we are building
an APP that plays on accessibility.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.048
I wanted to make something really clear

00:01:27.048 --> 00:01:30.214
and easy to use, and
Material Design really helped me.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.448
All these guidelines are really clear.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.812
The versions of the application in Android are
iterated easily,

00:01:35.812 --> 00:01:39.160
and development of the whole
APP took about 3 months.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.980
When I made the APP, and it was a great moment,

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.938
I was just like "Wow, this is
so cool, I can call my mom now."

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.466
And I spent the next 24 hours
calling everybody in the world.

00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:50.125
All my friends.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.568
Before launching the product,

00:01:51.568 --> 00:01:53.113
GooglePlay is offering a Beta program

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.430
for meeting deaf people

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.714
specifically to test the APP.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.946
And so there's people in Canada trying the APP out.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.933
There's people in Kuwait.

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:02.747
There's somebody in Japan.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.035
It's not like a game where if you have a bug,

00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:08.362
you just fix it, it's supposed to be a life-changing

00:02:08.362 --> 00:02:11.206
experience for a person with hearing disabilities.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.171
If it doesn't work well,
it will be really disappointing.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.063
So with thanks to the beta testing program,

00:02:17.063 --> 00:02:20.332
we were able to get it right
from the first public version.

00:02:21.175 --> 00:02:22.782
What I enjoy the most developing

00:02:22.782 --> 00:02:24.669
RogerVoice application on droid is that

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:27.792
I create something that
really matters to the end-users.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.996
I feel like when you release something out there,

00:02:30.996 --> 00:02:32.789
it's like end of story.

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:34.896
Then you can think about it another way.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.331
You can be like "Okay, you've gone this far,

00:02:37.331 --> 00:02:39.127
but now there's so much more to do."

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.638
I see that probably the
biggest evolution going forward.

00:02:43.638 --> 00:02:47.808
Put accessibility as the major
component of development and design.

00:02:48.895 --> 00:02:50.526
And I'm proud to be part of that trend.
