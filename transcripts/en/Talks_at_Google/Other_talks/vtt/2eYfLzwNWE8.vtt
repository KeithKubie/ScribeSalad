00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.334
FEMALE SPEAKER: Please join
me in welcoming Jason Ng.

00:00:03.334 --> 00:00:06.281
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:06.281 --> 00:00:07.072
JASON Q. NG: Great.

00:00:07.072 --> 00:00:10.690
No, thank you so much for having
me, Ann-- especially to Ann,

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.390
and everybody here at Google.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.520
And also, to the
Google Policy Team,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.320
I want to especially
thank Paul Nicholas

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.185
for helping arrange this talk.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.930
So thanks you all
for coming out.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.070
Hopefully, this will be a little
light-hearted fun opportunity

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.660
for you to learn a little bit
about some of the issues that

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.430
are taking place within
the Chinese online sphere,

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.130
and also about how they affect
our own issues here in the US

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.830
and abroad.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.120
So yeah, so a lot
of people always

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.050
ask me how I started with this.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.980
I was actually a book
editor for a long time,

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.104
and I was an English major.

00:00:45.104 --> 00:00:48.230
And folks wonder
how I got interested

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.770
in online issues and
internet censorship.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.930
And I often point them to
this one particular chart,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.130
which may look
familiar to some of you

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.920
folks who work on Google Trends.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.349
This is an image of
search volume coming out

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:08.390
of a particular
province in China called

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.950
Xinjiang in the Northwest
from the dates ranging

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.200
from 2009 to 2010.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.210
And even if you don't
work on Google Trends,

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.160
you might be able to tell that
something odd is taking place

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:20.504
here.

00:01:20.504 --> 00:01:22.170
Clearly, something
that has dropped off,

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.030
and something didn't happen.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.530
And what didn't happen was there
was no internet in Xinjiang

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:34.650
for roughly 10 months from
July 29, 2009, to May 2010.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.580
And if you don't
trust Google's data,

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.147
you could also perform the same
sort of thing on Baidu index,

00:01:39.147 --> 00:01:40.730
and you'll get the
same sort of thing.

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.880
For 10 months, there
was no internet

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.705
essentially in an entire
province in China.

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:46.330
And when we're talking
about provinces,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.270
we're talking about
regions that are roughly

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.150
the size of whole
countries in other places.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.730
So it was from here that
I got really interested

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.100
in the ability of
governments and authorities

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.340
to really control the online
sphere, which a lot of folks

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.500
thought was completely
uncontrollable.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.320
There's the famous quote
of Bill Clinton saying

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.940
controlling the internet is
like nailing jello to the wall.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.630
And obviously, China
has done something

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.500
to figure out a way to
strap jello to the wall,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.050
and that way is using various
forms of online censorship.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.580
However, the only thing
is you probably won't ever

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.490
find China perform
this sort of thing

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.570
again for multiple reasons.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.330
But one-- it would
scare the begeezus out

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.080
of economic investors
and other businesses.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.930
People would flee if
China ever turned off

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.970
the internet in, say,
Beijing if they were faced

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.810
with some sort of riots
or some sort of unrest.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.260
So that's one reason.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.744
But two, also because there's
whole other sorts of tactics

00:02:47.744 --> 00:02:48.660
that they can use now.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.951
They're much more nuanced
and sophisticated than simply

00:02:50.951 --> 00:02:55.010
just turning off the internet
if there's a riot in a province.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.370
And some of those obviously
are the famed IP blocking

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.110
and the blacklisting of
sites in China, which

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.640
many of you I'm
sure are aware of.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.870
So YouTube, Facebook, Twitter
are all essentially blocked

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.360
from folks within
mainland China.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.550
They're blocked from
mainland Chinese folks

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.930
from accessing them through
the so-called Great Firewall.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.771
And then we have other
forms of blocking,

00:03:17.771 --> 00:03:19.270
like the so-called
packet filtering.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:20.950
If you try and
reach websites that

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.630
have certain sensitive
keywords on them,

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.166
you may not be able to them.

00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:25.790
But what I'm particularly
interested in

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.740
are the sort of
filtering and disruptions

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.650
that take place
on the site level.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.585
These are issues that
are really complicated,

00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:36.960
and have to deal with a
lot with self-censorship

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.160
by private companies
within China

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.130
who have to deal with
government oversight,

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.920
and trying to figure
out what do we allow,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.990
and what do we not allow.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:51.960
And in particular, I'm
focusing on search blocks

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.150
which is my area of expertise.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.550
And I look at search blocks
on one particular social media

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.170
website, Sina Weibo, and
how they're implemented,

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.470
and what is actually blocked.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.500
So if we move on-- but
first, what is Sina Weibo?

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.620
Some of you may
have heard about it,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.870
and been familiar with perhaps
its reach and its power

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.190
now within China.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.800
And some folks refer to it
as a sort of Twitter copycat,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.839
but it's more than
just a Twitter copycat.

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:25.700
Sure, you all have on Weibo
your own 140-character posts

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.470
that you can put up
on your own page.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.290
But it also has this
ability to-- there's polls

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.990
on Sina Weibo.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.480
There threaded comments, so you
can have conversations on Weibo

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.730
very easily.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.839
There's ways of dating
portal type activity.

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:43.130
It's more akin to Facebook
than actually just a Twitter

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.920
microblog site.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.800
So what sort of content
do you find on Sina Weibo?

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.160
Stuff like this.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.960
People posting this
sort of content

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:58.420
that you would find in Western
social media-- frivolous,

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.920
fun pictures of stuffed
animals and people's pets.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.180
So that's one kind of content
you find on Sina Weibo.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.090
However, you also can find
stuff like this-- slightly more

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.470
provocative images
that were circulated.

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.690
This one was from 2012.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.480
There was a chemical
factory protest in Sichuan,

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.570
and there was this
iconic photo that

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:27.862
was circulated across Weibo
of a young lady protesting

00:05:27.862 --> 00:05:31.560
against this building of
a PX chemical factory.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.000
And this image was circulated,
eventually before it

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.930
was actually
censored and blocked

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.510
from being shared on Weibo.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.740
So again, like you would
find in Western media,

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.740
Weibo is this powerful tool
for not just playful humor,

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.030
but also for more
provactive organizing

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.130
like you would
find in this image.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.840
So does the government
recognize the power of Weibo?

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.170
Yes, they do.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:02.510
They realize that Weibo cannot
only be this force for creating

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.600
unrest and disturbances,
and perhaps disrupting

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:08.630
what's taking place
with the status quo,

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.810
but also can be this really
fascinating way to have

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.495
oversight over local officials.

00:06:16.495 --> 00:06:19.480
It's an opportunity to
have really great feedback

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.440
toward internet users.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.580
And so there's this quote from
this Party Journal in 2012,

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:27.955
the "Study Times,"
where they state,

00:06:27.955 --> 00:06:29.830
Sina Weibo-- "It's like
a double-edged sword;

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.180
it not only allows us
to respond to crises

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.430
will provide a tool that is more
scientific and more expedient,

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.120
also has limitations
or negative effects

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.161
that are very prominent."

00:06:38.161 --> 00:06:39.700
So the government
is aware that they

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:46.080
need to control Weibo if
they want to make sure

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.480
that the things stay the
same as they are now.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.900
So ways that the government
goes about it-- actually,

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.730
they've been ramping
up on their side.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.690
And in response,
internet users have

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.330
been ramping up on
their side, too.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.580
So when the government
and authorities

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.610
implement all sorts
of new technology

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.740
to monitor and surveil
citizens, and to censor content,

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.100
internet users respond.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.830
So one of the ways that
I like to talk about

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:14.700
is how government
and the authorities

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.590
figured out a way to really
quickly highlight and figure

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.050
out-- find posts-- that contain
sensitive content by work

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.640
searching for keywords.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.550
In response, internet
users realized

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.900
that governments and
authorities were doing this,

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.380
and they decided to embed
their text within images.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.300
So sort of a steganography
sort of technique.

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.320
However, the government
then responded in kind

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.100
by finding sensitive
content, sensitive images,

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.290
and doing sorts
of image searches,

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:42.740
and wiping them out right away.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.250
So it's a cat and mouse game
that goes back and forth,

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.620
and it continues to this day.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:50.240
So back to Weibo.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.030
Some of the more specific ways
that the government actually

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:55.940
does filter content on Weibo.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:59.690
Posting certain keywords, either
by themselves or in combination

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:04.080
with other keywords, will give
you this really vague message

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.990
that says, sorry, this content--
and if you're interested,

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:08.560
that keyword says
Wen Jiabao, who's

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.730
the former Prime
Minister in China.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.230
And the message that you
get is, sorry, this content

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:17.900
violates Sina's rules,
blah, blah, blah.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:22.350
If you need assistance, please
contact customer service.

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:25.525
I wish you luck if you feel
like contacting them, and seeing

00:08:25.525 --> 00:08:26.340
what you get back.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.780
So another way that they do
it, simply by deleting content.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.980
Content sometimes vanishes
from Weibo without a trace,

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:38.840
except there been websites like
Free Weibo-- freeweibo.com--

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.169
that actually suck up
all the tweets that get

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.134
posted on Weibo before
they get deleted.

00:08:44.134 --> 00:08:45.550
And then when they
do get deleted,

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:46.930
they actually
retain a copy of it,

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:48.263
and then share it with everyone.

00:08:48.263 --> 00:08:50.940
So this is an image that
took place in [? Mingboa ?]--

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.690
or where this is an image
of an event that took place

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:59.000
in [? Mingboa ?] last week,
or two weeks ago, actually.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.380
We're not quite sure what's
happening in the photo,

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.210
but we do know that
apparently policemen

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.910
are dragging away a man.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:09.150
And the image was
censored on Weibo.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.910
Actually, someone
posted it, and then

00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:15.280
within a short amount of time,
it was no longer on Weibo.

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.350
And actually, if you're trying
to access it through the API,

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.808
it'll give you a
message that says,

00:09:19.808 --> 00:09:24.310
sorry, this content doesn't
exist, or permission denied.

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:27.290
So that's another
technique that Weibo

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:31.890
is very famed for using
to get rid of content.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.350
But my particular form
of-- again, like I said,

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:35.760
the information
control technique

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.970
that I'm most interested
in is the search blocks.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:40.767
Search blocks are very flexible.

00:09:40.767 --> 00:09:42.350
You can add words
to the list one day,

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.760
take them off the next day.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:44.982
Content's still there.

00:09:44.982 --> 00:09:46.940
However, what you're
doing is inhibiting people

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.560
from finding information.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.590
So there's some sort
of protest going on,

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.920
someone wants to look
up information on it,

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:57.490
if the sort of keywords that
they're using to look for it

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.930
are on that blacklist, they'll
get this message that says,

00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:03.460
due to relevant laws, we
can't show you results.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.780
And for this one, this
keyword is "Wen Yunsong,"

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.510
who was actually the
son of Wen Jiabao.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:13.170
And he's notable in China
for being a billionaire.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:16.560
And you wonder, how did this
guy become a billionaire?

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.410
His father, perhaps?

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:24.880
So this sort of thing touches
on sensitive issues in China.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.120
A lot of times, these words are
blocked on Weibo in addition

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:30.490
to being filtered in other ways.

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:32.910
So I'm not the only one
doing this sort of research.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.050
A lot of other folks
I was inspired by,

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.750
and have continued my
line of work-- especially

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:41.300
folks at "China Digital Times,"
Gary King at Harvard, folks

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:43.550
at the University of Hong
Kong-- who made a great tool

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:47.470
called Weiboscope-- David
Bamman, Carnegie Mellon,

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.540
and his associates
at Carnegie Mellon,

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.760
and Jed Crandall and
his associates at UNM.

00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.450
And GreatFire.org,
which like I said,

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.390
they do Free Weibo,
which is that tool

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:02.120
that I showed before about
tracking deleted posts.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.060
And also, this tool
called GreatFire.org

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:08.730
where you can actually
see over time historically

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.430
the sort of key
words and information

00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.280
that's blocked on Weibo.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:14.590
So this one is showing
you across time

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.930
from March 2012 up to now
how Weibo treated searches

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:21.450
for Bo Xilai, who was
this corrupt politician--

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:23.200
or allegedly, corrupt
politician who

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:26.670
was recently convicted, and
sentenced to life in prison

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.980
for his various
nefarious activities.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.482
And you'll see that
based on current events,

00:11:34.482 --> 00:11:35.940
his name may or
may not be blocked.

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:38.670
So for instance, you'll see
at the beginning of April,

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:39.680
there was a shift.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.090
That was when a lot of
the scandals and rumors

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.510
started to pop up.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.780
In late September,
there's another shift.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.059
That's when he was actually
kicked out of the party.

00:11:49.059 --> 00:11:51.600
And then all of a sudden, people
were able to search for him.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.270
And people claim that that's
perhaps due to the fact

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.140
that the government
wanted to continue

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.930
to allow citizens to
criticize him online.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.020
So as you can see,
there's a correlation

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:04.110
between online events
and offline events, which

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:06.880
seems fairly intuitive, but
it's good to have the data there

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:07.968
to actually show you.

00:12:07.968 --> 00:12:10.070
So continuing on.

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:13.410
So what did I do?

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.015
GreatFire, "China Digital
Times," they do fantastic work

00:12:16.015 --> 00:12:19.609
in confirming, I think,
what is sensitive

00:12:19.609 --> 00:12:20.650
and what isn't sensitive.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.800
So for instance, Bo Xilai is
in the news about a corruption

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:24.500
scandal.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.374
Let's check and see if
he's blocked on Weibo,

00:12:26.374 --> 00:12:28.190
and to confirm whether
or not Weibo thinks

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:31.440
he's sensitive,
and worth blocking.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.830
However, what about all the
words that we don't know

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:35.630
are sensitive?

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:38.990
Like for instance, "foot
fetish," or other things

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:39.904
like that?

00:12:39.904 --> 00:12:41.320
I think that's
where I stepped in.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.820
And what I did was I took
a giant list of words.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.500
In this case, Wikipedia's
article titles

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.530
in the Chinese language
addition, which totaled up

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:53.890
to 700,000 keywords,
and I ran them

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.570
through Sina Weibo in
this very simple script

00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:59.160
that tested or not whether
or not each word was blocked

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.000
or not.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.390
And then I recorded
them into a database,

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:05.600
and basically did various
things to try and understand

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.620
why they were blocked,
including doing research

00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:12.470
into the history, the language,
and other sorts of things.

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:16.590
So in the end, I came up
with 500 blocked keywords.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:18.620
And in the book,
I have 150 of them

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:21.400
that I write up in
more detail, reasons

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.760
about why they are considered
sensitive in Chinese culture,

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.260
and to the Chinese government.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.100
So without context,
some of the words

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:33.650
that I've organized thematically
throughout the book.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:37.760
So words related to government,
CCP, politics, and nationalism.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.020
So a lot of them
are fairly obvious.

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:43.021
Some of them less so unless
you know the context, which

00:13:43.021 --> 00:13:44.770
hopefully I provide
in the book, and which

00:13:44.770 --> 00:13:47.590
I'll do with some of
these words in more detail

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.070
later on in the presentation.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.765
So some other words about
dissent, censorship,

00:13:52.765 --> 00:14:03.000
and justice; sex,
drugs, immorality;

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.590
people, scandals,
disasters, and rumors.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:11.350
As some you know--
may know-- there's

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.360
been a big anti-rumor
campaign going on

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.120
in China during the
past several months.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:22.230
So rumors are clearly on the
mind of the censors these days.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:29.600
Information and media; security,
violence, and other words

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.770
that deal with people
being suppressed.

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.780
And then there are words I
just don't have a clue why.

00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.100
And I think these
really remind us

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.676
that there's a human
element involved here.

00:14:43.676 --> 00:14:45.050
There are people
actually putting

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:48.330
these words on the list, and
they know what's going on,

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.029
so yeah.

00:14:51.029 --> 00:14:53.320
All right, so we'll just go
through a few of the words,

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.420
and hopefully this will be
an opportunity for you guys

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.720
to give me some--
shout out if you

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.890
know why they might be blocked.

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:03.930
But here's one.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:07.500
If you don't read Chinese,
hopefully the pronunciation

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.509
might help you out.

00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:11.050
Any thoughts?

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.620
There you go.

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.940
So tank-- [SPEAKING_CHINESE]--
is actually a reference

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:20.050
to "tank man."

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.255
It was blocked for some
time in early 2012.

00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:24.880
it's actually unblocked
now, so now you

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.890
can search for tanks to your
heart's delight on Weibo.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:31.530
But you're not going to
see this image on Weibo,

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:35.960
or through any sort
of search engine

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.520
in China, either, because
obviously it refers back

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.800
to this precarious time
in Chinese history.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:45.210
In 1989, the day
after the soldiers

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:48.020
came in and cleared
the Square, this man

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.810
stood there on June 5th, and
blocked a column of tanks

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:54.020
from entering and/or leaving
from Tianamen Square.

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.599
And that's what we have.

00:15:57.599 --> 00:15:58.390
Here's another one.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.321
Literally, it means
"hairy bacon."

00:16:04.321 --> 00:16:05.820
You pronounce it
[SPEAKING CHINESE].

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.640
"Mao" means "hair,"
and [SPEAKING CHINESE]

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:12.620
is sort of like a preserved
meat, like a jerky or bacon.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:17.810
And however, "mao" isn't
only just a word for "hair,"

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.955
it's also a surname--
a Chinese surname.

00:16:20.955 --> 00:16:26.670
If some of you may know a
famous Mao in Chinese history.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.920
And so, Mao Zedong.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.700
[SPEAKING CHINESE]
doesn't also just mean

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:35.580
preserved meat that
you eat, but also

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.760
a different kind of preserved
meat-- Mao's body, which

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.700
is laid in state
inside Tianamen Square.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:45.150
So this is an example of a
coded keyword where are internet

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:48.970
users have decided that this
is some sort of coded insult

00:16:48.970 --> 00:16:52.705
for Mao, but also an insult
for the current government.

00:16:52.705 --> 00:16:55.080
So for instance, they'll say
things to the effect of, oh,

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.954
[SPEAKING CHINESE[
certainly wouldn't approve

00:16:56.954 --> 00:16:59.760
of today's policies--
economic reform policies.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:04.250
So it's a way to get around
the censors by using words

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:06.900
that the censors wouldn't
have known to block.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.630
However, as I've shown, the
censors figured this one out.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:11.520
They blocked it.

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.430
And the only reason I
was able to figure out

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.096
that internet users
were using this word

00:17:15.096 --> 00:17:17.089
was because it was blocked.

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:19.044
In fact, when I was
researching the book,

00:17:19.044 --> 00:17:21.169
and I actually figured out
this was a blocked word,

00:17:21.169 --> 00:17:23.222
I asked multiple
native speakers then.

00:17:23.222 --> 00:17:24.680
They had never
heard of the phrase.

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.660
And in fact, it's
so obscure, I only

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.520
find it in a couple
of places-- in fact,

00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.590
in a recipe for how to
prepare [SPEAKING CHINESE].

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:35.995
Apparently, you
dip it in nitrate,

00:17:35.995 --> 00:17:38.350
and eventually,
it's able to keep

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:42.450
in a glass case
for up to 40 years.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:45.276
So I think this is an example of
the sort of so-called Streisand

00:17:45.276 --> 00:17:47.400
effect-- the fact that
someone tried to prevent you

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.930
from blocking it gave
greater prominence to it.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:52.440
Because otherwise,
who would have

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.880
known that [SPEAKING CHINESE]
was a sensitive term, when

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:58.310
in fact so few people
actually use this thing?

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:02.160
So again, internet users being
playful, and being caught up

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.459
with it.

00:18:03.459 --> 00:18:04.250
Here's another one.

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.370
This one is actually not
created by internet users,

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:11.340
but by official media-- in this
case, official media in Hong

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.400
Kong.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:14.960
If you guys aren't
familiar, China

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.400
has this sort of one
country, two systems

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.520
rule wherein Hong Kong has a
sort of more liberal policies

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.390
with regards to
freedom of information,

00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:24.500
freedom of expression.

00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.490
Their political system is
more free than it is in China.

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:29.988
And in this case--

00:18:29.988 --> 00:18:32.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:32.870
JASON Q. NG: Yeah.

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:36.840
So "empty stool" refers
to the empty chair

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.470
that Liu Xiaobo
would have sat in,

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:44.820
but was vacated at the 2010
Nobel Peace Prize ceremony.

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.070
So "empty stool" was a
reference in Hong Kong media,

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:49.940
talking about the empty stool.

00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:52.880
And so there you have it.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.700
So media is also
closely watched,

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:59.560
not just internet users.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:04.590
Here's one that internet users
were able to contribute to.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:06.280
This one is [SPEAKING
CHINESE] which

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:08.780
literally means
"month month bird."

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.620
But as an example of the sort of
games that internet users like

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:16.540
to play, this actually--
if you put them together--

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.650
equals a single character,
[SPEAKING CHINESE],

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:20.400
in reference to
[SPEAKING CHINESE], who

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.380
was the former
Premiere of China.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:27.750
And he was actually the one
in June 4-- back in 1989

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.020
who actually pushed
for the government

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:34.700
to enter into the Square, and
be more assertive about dealing

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.740
with the protesters.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.260
So he's clearly a
controversial figure

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.070
in Chinese current
events and history.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:45.960
And so, references to his
name are sensitive online.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:48.350
So when internet
users recognized

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:52.520
that you couldn't perhaps use
his name, or using his name

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:55.480
itself-- the one
with the characters

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.940
all squished together--
using his name is sensitive,

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:00.300
and may cause your post
to be deleted right away.

00:20:00.300 --> 00:20:03.310
They decided to split it
up, and as a sort of game

00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:05.340
to try and get
around the censors.

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:07.580
Unfortunately, this
was also caught.

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.970
And so, [SPEAKING CHINESE],
"month month bird,"

00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:13.650
the monthly bird is now
no longer acceptable

00:20:13.650 --> 00:20:17.124
discourse on Weibo.

00:20:17.124 --> 00:20:22.100
OK, here's one that's more
historical in nature-- wu wang.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.637
So it literally means "never
forget," or "don't forget."

00:20:24.637 --> 00:20:26.220
And in this case,
this one is actually

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:31.580
a reference to a four-character
idiomatic phrase in China,

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.900
[SPEAKING CHINESE],
which means, "don't

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:39.000
forget that we're in Zhu," the
city of Zhu, which relates back

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.100
to a historical moment
in China wherein

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.740
this general and his
troops were actually

00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.750
surrounded in a small city.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:51.100
And these forces
were all around them.

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.164
And basically, he said
this phrase to them,

00:20:54.164 --> 00:20:56.080
"Don't forget we're in
the city of [? Zhu." ?]

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:59.810
And then they fought back, and
they retook the country back.

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:04.940
So any thoughts what
parallels that might have to?

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.040
Ah, Taiwan.

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:09.410
So basically, this
inscription is actually

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:10.630
in [SPEAKING CHINESE].

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:14.710
And it was put there
by Chiang Kai-shek

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:19.090
as a sort of our rallying cry
to tell Taiwanese citizens

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.740
that we'll come take
back the mainland.

00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:25.610
So clearly that's sensitive,
Taiwanese-Chinese politics.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:28.690
But also, this phrase is
also used in a different way,

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.320
a different thing that
we shouldn't forget--

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.190
don't forget 6 4, or June 4th.

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.990
So again, that
phrase can be used

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:39.430
for historical slash
political references, but also

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:43.860
more recent events.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.020
Another more recent
event-- so keywords

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.150
can oftentimes be related
to very contemporary events.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:54.840
In this case, the
term "rich woman"

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.440
refers to a specific rich woman.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.870
Guo Meimei, from
in recent years,

00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:05.530
she actually was a women
who posted on Weibo

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:09.740
that she was an employee
of the Red Cross in China.

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:13.920
And she then flaunted images of
herself in front of a Maserati,

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:17.440
in front of her Hermes handbags,
first class plane tickets.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.480
And obviously,
Chinese netizens were

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.760
outraged that someone
associated with a charity

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.440
could be so rich, they wondered
how she got her wealth.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:31.260
Eventually, did this human
flush search-- essentially

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.120
netizens banding together to
figure out who a person is.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.590
And they figured
out who she was.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:37.700
And she had to come
out and apologize.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.274
The Red Cross in China had
to come out and disassociate

00:22:40.274 --> 00:22:42.190
themselves from her, and
say that she actually

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:43.880
wasn't an employee.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:46.480
And in the end,
actually, this event

00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.714
had severe repercussions
on the Red Cross in China.

00:22:50.714 --> 00:22:52.380
And their donations
fell by something up

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.710
to close to 50%
the following year.

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:58.844
So the power of
internet users in China.

00:22:58.844 --> 00:23:00.510
Two more, and then
we'll get to the Q&amp;A.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:03.210
And so this one, "gaoyaoqi."

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:05.110
This one's just sort
of fun. "Gaoyao"

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:13.710
means like plaster medicine,
or it's like plastic,

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:15.330
and "qi" is "flag."

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:18.740
So that refers back to a sort
of like a medicinal patch

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:21.950
that Chinese users
like, Chinese folks

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:23.630
use for healing themselves.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:28.276
But it's also a coded
insult for the Japanese flag

00:23:28.276 --> 00:23:29.900
and Japanese people,
because it sort of

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.510
looks like the Japanese flag.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:35.110
So that's another fun
one playing with images.

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:42.790
And then the last one we'll
do-- "satellite television."

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.410
Again, a lot of these
words are out there.

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:47.050
I'm just putting
out my best guess.

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.600
But in this case, the reason
why this might be blocked

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:57.240
may be due to the fact that back
in, I believe in 1990s, Rupert

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:01.390
Murdoch tried to enter China
by creating this satellite

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:02.950
television company, Sky.

00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:05.055
And he actually stated
in an interview,

00:24:05.055 --> 00:24:06.930
"Advances in the technology
of communications

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:10.130
have proved an unambiguous
threat to totalitarian

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:12.940
regimes," and basically
said that we're

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:14.150
coming for you, China.

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:15.760
We're going to bring
in satellite TV.

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.600
We're going to open
up your country.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:23.260
And Chinese folks didn't
take too kindly to this.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.185
The Chinese authorities actually
banned satellite television,

00:24:26.185 --> 00:24:29.300
so satellite dishes are
technically illegal in China.

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.980
And then Rupert Murdoch actually
had to spend the next decade

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.580
trying to recover
from that faux pas,

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.530
and trying to suck up to
the Chinese government.

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:40.780
And if you wander
around China today,

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:44.380
even though satellite dishes
are technically illegal,

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:47.030
you'll find that
folks have decided

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:50.760
to flaunt for flout that ban.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:55.484
So I think that's the keywords
that I'll just present today.

00:24:55.484 --> 00:24:57.150
If you're interested
in more, of course,

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:59.450
you could read my book, or
my blog, Blocked on Weibo.

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.241
But I just wanted to
close today by talking

00:25:01.241 --> 00:25:06.380
a little bit about what we
can take away from this.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:10.690
Seeing how Chinese authorities
regulate the internet

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:13.560
and control their information
online I think is fascinating,

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.930
not just in a purely
China context,

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:19.570
but also looking at how
things are affecting

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:22.120
regions around the world--
not just authoritarian regimes

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:25.970
in Iran, Syria, and elsewhere,
but also here in the US,

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:27.150
in Europe.

00:25:27.150 --> 00:25:31.890
You have all sorts of tension
between private companies,

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:33.710
between governments,
between internet users

00:25:33.710 --> 00:25:37.595
about how much information is
allowed to be shared online,

00:25:37.595 --> 00:25:40.150
and what sorts of information
shouldn't be shared,

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:41.590
and who gets to decide.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:44.250
I think that's sort
of the conversation

00:25:44.250 --> 00:25:47.380
that hopefully my book
will be able to spur.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.420
Where do we actually
draw the line

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:52.790
between trying to protect
the security of everyone

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:56.670
versus trying to promote
and allow folks to have

00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:01.310
the individual expression
that we so need in societies?

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:05.230
So hopefully the
book isn't something

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.460
that's purely out
there to attack China,

00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:10.320
but instead it's an opportunity
to understand the motives why

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.640
authorities might decide
to censor certain content.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.290
And by doing this,
we can hopefully

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.895
figure out ways to provide
incentives, and try

00:26:19.895 --> 00:26:23.810
and understand how
to nudge authorities

00:26:23.810 --> 00:26:27.030
to trying to dismantle some
of these obviously very

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:30.190
restrictive environments that
we have around the world today.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.270
So thank you so
much for having me,

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:35.516
and I'd be happy to take any
questions that you all have.

00:26:35.516 --> 00:26:40.842
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:40.842 --> 00:26:42.050
JASON Q. NG: I'll stand here.

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:43.770
So if you guys
have any questions

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:48.090
about China, particular key
words, about my research,

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:49.200
or anything else.

00:26:52.658 --> 00:26:53.646
Yeah?

00:26:53.646 --> 00:26:57.845
AUDIENCE: So what are the
ages of the people who

00:26:57.845 --> 00:27:00.180
are saying these
kind of key words.

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:01.220
Are they younger?

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:03.710
Because it seems like
a lot of the key words

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:05.923
you mention have
historical reference,

00:27:05.923 --> 00:27:07.580
so I'm wondering
how much of that

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:12.090
[INAUDIBLE] the younger
people are cognizant of.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:15.100
JASON Q. NG: Yeah, I think
that's a very important point.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.790
The very fact that you
have to use sometimes

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:21.330
these coded keywords to
get around the censors

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:24.000
means that by the very nature
of using these keywords,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.130
you're sort of losing
out on communicating

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.860
in a more direct fashion
with the mass folks.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:36.190
So using [SPEAKING CHINESE]
or using that idiomatic phrase

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:39.230
means that the censors
are being effective.

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:42.620
They're essentially cutting
off a chance for you

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:43.860
to connect with everyone.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:49.170
However, that's the
push for internet users

00:27:49.170 --> 00:27:53.050
to try and use phrases
that are coded in a way,

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:57.000
but also very
understandable to everybody.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.440
So for that idiomatic phrase,
maybe not everyone knows it.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.600
But other things,
like May 35th, which

00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:06.070
is a coded keyword for June
4th, I think most folks in China

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:08.380
do recognize what that means.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:12.100
And so it's trying to find
within that cat and mouse game,

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:16.374
trying to find this to walk the
line of being evasive, but not

00:28:16.374 --> 00:28:17.790
so evasive that
you don't actually

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:18.960
connect with internet users.

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.130
So in terms of actual
age, Weibo is primarily,

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:26.400
like most social media,
a youth-driven media-- so

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:27.710
folks, college kids.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:31.890
But it's also really
been this powerful tool

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:35.010
for not just youth
and their frivolous

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:38.370
posting pictures of what
they did last night,

00:28:38.370 --> 00:28:41.560
but also for activists
and journalists.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:45.882
So you'll find a lot of those
folks online on Weibo, as well.

00:28:45.882 --> 00:28:51.284
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] did
your book get [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:51.284 --> 00:28:56.439
And secondly, did hashtags
play any role in [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:56.439 --> 00:28:57.980
JASON Q. NG: So this
was interesting.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:00.820
I was actually in
Toronto, and someone we

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.410
came up and asked a
question, or basically said,

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:05.645
oh, I posted on Weibo that
I was attending your talk,

00:29:05.645 --> 00:29:07.290
and I posted an
image of your book.

00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:10.660
And within five minutes,
the post disappeared.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:13.150
So I don't know if that's
indicative of what's happening,

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:14.900
but it's interesting.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.850
Maybe I shouldn't say
this, but the blog--

00:29:17.850 --> 00:29:20.970
which the book is based
on-- isn't blocked in China,

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:23.480
because I think it's
written in English,

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:26.232
and it doesn't really have
a big user base in China.

00:29:26.232 --> 00:29:28.690
So it doesn't really matter to
Chinese authorities so much.

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:31.720
But that is interesting.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:35.000
As four hashtags,
I think hashtags

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.400
aren't quite as a big deal
on social media in China,

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:44.240
because one, perhaps, because
of language-- not issue,

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.790
but language opportunity.

00:29:46.790 --> 00:29:49.890
Chinese is so much more
compact than English,

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:52.850
and that each character actually
represents an entire word.

00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:54.690
So 140 characters,
you actually say

00:29:54.690 --> 00:29:56.720
a good amount in 140 characters.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.390
So you don't really
need hashtags

00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:03.480
as a way of this sort of
reductive meme sort of tool.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.920
So you're actually able
to say what you want.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:08.190
But in Chinese
social media, I think

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:10.150
images are super powerful.

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.040
Those get circulated so widely.

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.990
Even images of whole essays.

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:19.520
So you'll often find people
who post-- they'll actually

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.520
type out a 300, 400, 500
characteristic essay--

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:27.050
sometimes even longer, make
an image of it, and post that.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.350
And that sort of thing gets
circulated very widely.

00:30:34.848 --> 00:30:36.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
anecdote is

00:30:36.260 --> 00:30:39.410
an example of how this cat
and mouse game evolves,

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:41.790
and you actually have
different tactics being used.

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:45.620
To what extent does your
research or continued research

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:49.685
on this indicate that there's
a different way that people

00:30:49.685 --> 00:30:51.940
are trying to post
censored information,

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.317
and that censors are going
to interact with them?

00:30:55.317 --> 00:30:57.650
General question, is you've
got a very rich, descriptive

00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:01.210
account sort of focused on
particular words and themes,

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.250
and you have stories
associated with them.

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.460
To what extent did this
help you anticipate

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:09.060
what future censorship and
sort of dissident interactions

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:10.286
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:10.286 --> 00:31:11.660
JASON Q. NG: Yeah,
I think what's

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:15.640
particularly interesting is
how internet users are trying

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:18.460
to shift away from this sort
of public face in social media.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:23.900
So as a lot of folks in
authoritarian societies

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:27.870
have realized, that
posting material publicly

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:29.945
is great for
sharing information.

00:31:33.490 --> 00:31:35.840
Sorry, I'll just
repeat the question.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.360
So the question was about, how
does my research anticipate

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.882
what sort of future
shifts in trends

00:31:42.882 --> 00:31:44.590
will take place in
social media in China.

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:49.900
So public facing social
media is a great opportunity

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.520
to connect with
folks, but it's also

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:55.500
an opportunity or a chance
for information controls

00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:56.530
to be placed on it.

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:58.321
So I think a lot of
folks are shifting away

00:31:58.321 --> 00:32:00.940
from public face in
social media, like Weibo,

00:32:00.940 --> 00:32:04.340
towards more semi-public
or private social media,

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:08.090
like WeChat, and other
sorts of these chat clients

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:11.000
that a lot of folks are using
now on their mobile devices.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.160
So in this way, you can still
have thousands of followers

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:18.040
on WeChat, and you can
blast out posts to them,

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.930
but there's
hopefully no overseer

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:23.840
sneaking in, and surveilling
your conversation,

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.320
and censoring you,
and potentially

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.520
dragging you to jail.

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.115
So I think that's
one potential shift.

00:32:31.158 --> 00:32:32.699
AUDIENCE: Does your
research give you

00:32:32.699 --> 00:32:34.623
any indication what
portion of the censoring

00:32:34.623 --> 00:32:37.509
is somewhat automated,
and what portion is just

00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:39.430
totally human-made?

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:40.180
JASON Q. NG: Yeah.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:43.200
So the question was,
based on my research,

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.030
do I have a sense of how much
of the censorship is automated,

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:51.050
and how much of
it is human input?

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:53.170
I think looking at
my list, I think

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:55.860
it was fascinating-- especially
to me-- was most fascinating to

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.389
me was the human
element involved.

00:32:57.389 --> 00:32:59.930
Like for instance, you'll notice
that the word Hoobastank was

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:06.810
blocked on Weibo for some
time, which was weird to me,

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:08.840
because from what
I know, Hoobastank

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:13.570
isn't a very politically active
band or music act in China.

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:16.900
But in fact, what I
think was happening

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:18.880
there was the
English word, tank,

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.130
which is part of Hoobastank,
was the blocked key word.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:23.046
But in fact, when I
searched for the word tank

00:33:23.046 --> 00:33:24.870
at that same time,
"tank" was unblocked,

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.950
and Hoobastank, or maybe the
word stank itself, was blocked.

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:30.160
So maybe there was
a typo somewhere.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.495
So these are the sorts of
things that you uncover.

00:33:33.495 --> 00:33:34.870
Other sorts of
research that I've

00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:37.036
done at the Citizen Lab
with collaborators up there,

00:33:37.036 --> 00:33:38.910
we've noticed also
various incidences

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:41.380
of human censor making mistakes.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:46.260
Sometimes they'll uploaded a
list of blacklisted keywords,

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:48.290
and they'll
accidentally unencrypt--

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:49.800
or they'll accidentally
encrypt it the wrong way,

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:50.750
and it doesn't work,
and then you'll

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:52.740
see them frantically
uploading a new file,

00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:54.800
like 30 minutes later.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.090
So there's a human
element involved.

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:00.760
And I think providing
more insight

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:04.320
is this recent Reuters
story where they interview

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:07.710
actual censors-- human censors--
who work at these facilities.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:09.920
This one was in Tianjin
outside Beijing.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:12.380
And they said that there
was something close

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:15.889
several thousand censors
who work in a facility.

00:34:15.889 --> 00:34:17.409
They work in shifts.

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:19.739
They work in 10-hour
shifts, and folks come in

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:22.690
and they-- but they do have
automated tools to help

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:26.460
them identify and flag
sensitive key words.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.020
So there is computer
assistance involved.

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:30.929
There are algorithms
that they've written,

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:32.470
and they're constantly
getting better

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:37.647
in helping the human censors do
their job is more thoroughly.

00:34:37.647 --> 00:34:40.629
AUDIENCE: So in the Workers
Revolution [INAUDIBLE],

00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:42.120
one of the things
they did is they

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:46.172
did absurd things because it
would make the government feel

00:34:46.172 --> 00:34:47.558
stupid to crack down on it.

00:34:47.558 --> 00:34:51.781
They would meet in the square
[INAUDIBLE] that kind of thing.

00:34:51.781 --> 00:34:54.560
You couldn't arrest people
for eating ice cream.

00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:56.899
This workplace seems
absurd in the same way,

00:34:56.899 --> 00:34:59.060
but Chinese government
seems to have

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:03.778
less of a worry about being
seen being silly or something.

00:35:03.778 --> 00:35:04.770
I don't know.

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:09.730
Could you comment on
that difference in that

00:35:09.730 --> 00:35:12.954
the use of absurdism
versus blocking what

00:35:12.954 --> 00:35:14.674
seems like silly things.

00:35:14.674 --> 00:35:16.674
JASON Q. NG: Yeah, like
I said with the question

00:35:16.674 --> 00:35:20.980
before about how do
internet users walk

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:23.100
that fine line between
communicating to everyone,

00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:25.865
and also still
evading the censors?

00:35:25.865 --> 00:35:27.740
And one of the ways they
do it is with humor,

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:30.230
with funny images, which memes,
with sort of these inside

00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.730
jokes.

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:35.490
So for instance,
back in recently

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:37.700
for the June 4th commemoration,
which takes place

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:39.158
every year in China,
internet users

00:35:39.158 --> 00:35:41.215
actually posted an
image of the tank man,

00:35:41.215 --> 00:35:43.590
but they were placed all the
tanks with this giant rubber

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:44.600
duck.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:48.310
So you had four giant rubber
ducks facing off against a guy.

00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:52.170
So that's absurd and silly,
and for the government

00:35:52.170 --> 00:35:56.550
to crack down on that would
sort of be a statement about how

00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:00.470
they're maybe not just
not in favor of discussion

00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:04.590
of political sensitive content,
but also not in favor of humor.

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.890
So that's one method.

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:10.900
But yeah, it's
obviously a similar--

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:13.860
it's a topic that, I think,
internet users have recognized,

00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.470
that you don't purposely--
you don't punch

00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:18.350
the government in
the face perhaps.

00:36:18.350 --> 00:36:20.683
They've learned that that's
not a very effective tactic.

00:36:20.683 --> 00:36:22.540
We've seen from Liu
Xiaobo, other folks who

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:26.090
go out there directly
promoting political change.

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:29.890
They tend to get dragged
in, and that perhaps

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:31.880
isn't an effective tactic.

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.540
So what they do is they
organize things like everyone

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.290
wears a black t-shirt
on a particular day.

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:37.664
They go out and
walk the streets.

00:36:37.664 --> 00:36:38.720
They take a stroll.

00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.400
That's [SPEAKING CHINESE],
which is their method

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:44.190
for, I guess the sort of
eating ice cream in the square.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:53.400
So I think both methods are
supremely important in terms

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:56.340
of fermenting change
in China and progress.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.030
You need serious
political activists,

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:00.860
but you also need these sort
of light-hearted attempts

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:04.921
to sort of show how ludicrous
some of the censorship system

00:37:04.921 --> 00:37:05.420
is.

00:37:08.738 --> 00:37:12.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] groups.

00:37:12.450 --> 00:37:14.890
Is data available to do
your kind of analysis

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:17.575
on something like
that, like QQ groups

00:37:17.575 --> 00:37:20.324
and QQ instant messaging,
that sort of stuff.

00:37:20.324 --> 00:37:21.740
JASON Q. NG: Yeah,
QQ is another--

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:25.660
the question was about, can we
also track censorship on QQ,

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.764
which is a chat
client within China.

00:37:27.764 --> 00:37:29.430
I checked, that's
used around the world,

00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:33.460
but it's created by a Chinese
chat company called Tencent.

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:37.640
So yeah, it's
actually interesting.

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:42.130
One of the first real major
censorship gold mines--

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:45.220
or for censorship
researchers-- was actually,

00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.120
I think it was late 1990s,
or-- I forget when it was.

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:52.560
But hackers actually
figured out that QQ

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:57.202
was storing on your computer
a certain file that basically

00:37:57.202 --> 00:37:59.410
every time you typed
information in your chat window,

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:00.868
it would compare
it with this file.

00:38:00.868 --> 00:38:02.940
And if anything was
contained in that file,

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.660
they would actually
censor your content.

00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:07.860
So hackers actually
extracted the keyword list,

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.550
and actually shared that widely.

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:13.090
And I think that was one the
first instances of reverse

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:15.120
engineering the sort
of censorship that

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:16.700
is built into these
sort of systems.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:21.880
So yeah, there's definitely
researchers who are actively

00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:24.890
looking into various ways
that chat clients, like QQ

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:28.530
and WeChat and
other social media,

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:31.550
are actively censoring
and surveilling users.

00:38:31.550 --> 00:38:34.388
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] you
have on the effectiveness,

00:38:34.388 --> 00:38:37.940
because it seems like
for all their censorship,

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:42.530
it may block some casual
users, but between all

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:45.169
the evasions and all the
way people rephrase things,

00:38:45.169 --> 00:38:47.210
you said that basically--
the Red Cross incident,

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:49.535
they blocked a key
word, but it's still

00:38:49.535 --> 00:38:52.020
affecting their
donations by 50%.

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:54.870
So does it seem like the
information is stilling

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:56.370
getting out to a
majority of people,

00:38:56.370 --> 00:39:00.330
or is it only the ones who are
in the know, or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:01.080
JASON Q. NG: Yeah.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:05.350
The question was
about how effective

00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.770
do we actually think
these sort of blocking

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:12.885
and censorship is, because
based on what we've seen,

00:39:12.885 --> 00:39:14.760
internet users are able
to evade the censors.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:20.760
So I think the answer is that--
or I think one way to look at

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:24.012
is that we only know about
certain-- like for instance,

00:39:24.012 --> 00:39:24.970
the Red Cross incident.

00:39:24.970 --> 00:39:28.070
We know about that incident,
but what about the many dozens--

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:30.580
or for each of those
cases, many dozens of cases

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.010
that we don't know about?

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:34.260
So we may just have a
little tip of the iceberg.

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:37.084
We can see these sorts of
ways where internet users

00:39:37.084 --> 00:39:38.750
were able to evade
the censors, and were

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:41.580
able to produce a
profound change.

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:46.516
But the whole point of
censorship is that it's obtuse.

00:39:46.516 --> 00:39:47.890
We'll never find
out, we'll never

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:51.064
know unless more research
gets done, someone

00:39:51.064 --> 00:39:52.980
releases this information,
that sort of thing.

00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:57.050
So based on other
researcher people

00:39:57.050 --> 00:40:00.590
have done, there's a study
by [? Yu ?] and Robinson

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:06.210
where they look into why people
actually want to evade censors

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:10.552
or why would people want to
escape restrictions in China.

00:40:10.552 --> 00:40:12.010
And for the most
part, folks aren't

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:15.156
interested in engaging
in political activism.

00:40:15.156 --> 00:40:16.780
Folks are really
pretty much interested

00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:18.890
in just getting a stable
internet connection,

00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:20.400
getting access to information.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.610
And so based on
that sort of thing,

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:26.850
you get the sense that Chinese
internet users, the majority

00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:29.320
of them are, for the
most part, satisfied

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:33.580
with the sort of material
that they have online.

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.167
They don't have
YouTube, but they Youku.

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:37.750
Instead of Facebook,
they have Yunyun.

00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:41.260
So this sort of thing,
I think, appears

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:43.670
to be taking place in China.

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:45.900
But obviously, there
are hardcore, dedicated

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:49.074
folks who are focused on
expanding freedom of expression

00:40:49.074 --> 00:40:50.490
in China, making
sure that there's

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:52.190
social justice, and
that sort of thing.

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:57.605
And they do play a large
role in the social sphere.

00:40:57.605 --> 00:41:00.455
AUDIENCE: So your research seems
to be about the content that's

00:41:00.455 --> 00:41:02.355
censored, but how
about the people.

00:41:02.355 --> 00:41:06.350
Are they anonymous on
these social networks?

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:07.270
Are they tracked?

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:08.130
Are they surveilled?

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:11.850
Do they feel like they
may get in trouble

00:41:11.850 --> 00:41:13.160
if post certain [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.510
JASON Q. NG: Yeah.

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:18.915
Yeah, so the question was
about-- this is about content

00:41:18.915 --> 00:41:21.040
that's being blocked, but
what about the people who

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.123
post this sort of content.

00:41:22.123 --> 00:41:23.540
Do they fear for their lives?

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:26.180
Are there sort of ways for
the government to track them?

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:27.570
And the answer is yes.

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:33.850
Social media in China--
technically, for some time,

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:36.950
the government's imposed a
rule where social media had

00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:39.500
to require that people their
real names to register.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:44.770
So obviously, there are
loopholes to get around it.

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:50.040
So one of the ways that real
name registration required

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.260
was using your cell phone.

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.450
So sometimes, people would use
just throwaway cell phones,

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:54.283
and stuff like that.

00:41:54.283 --> 00:41:56.870
But in theory,
technically every cell

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:58.900
phone that you sign
up for, technically

00:41:58.900 --> 00:42:03.200
the vendor is supposed to have
your actual real information.

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:10.070
But that's China, or any
country where this sort of thing

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:13.580
is just like, come on, you're
really going to-- yeah.

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:17.232
So this has been a major issue,
especially with over the past

00:42:17.232 --> 00:42:18.690
several months and
over the summer,

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:22.530
wherein Weibo and other social
media have been targeting these

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:26.630
so-called big V's-- these
verified users on Weibo who are

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:27.410
these celebrities.

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:29.050
They have millions of followers.

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:30.740
They are very powerful.

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:32.920
They're the power
users of Weibo.

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.740
And they're known publicly.

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:39.440
They're intellectuals, scholars,
activists, lawyers, but also

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.700
just like actors and
actresses, and stuff like that.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.670
So we've seen
that-- and actually,

00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:49.140
in March the Head of the State
Internet Information Office

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:52.970
actually brought in all of these
bunch of big V's, and actually

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:54.100
had dinner with them.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:56.210
He called them in, sat
them down, and said,

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:59.380
look, we need to make sure
that social media in the future

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:01.880
isn't filled with rumors, isn't
filled with malicious lies.

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:03.713
We have to make sure
that what we're posting

00:43:03.713 --> 00:43:08.490
is supportive of the
health of society.

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:11.250
So people got the message.

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:14.344
And over the summer actually,
there was a big crack down,

00:43:14.344 --> 00:43:16.510
and a lot of these big V's
were actually dragged in.

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:21.020
There was one economic
writer, Charles Xue,

00:43:21.020 --> 00:43:22.190
was actually brought in.

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:24.790
He had to do this
forced confession.

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:27.040
There are other folks who
have been arrested recently.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:29.170
So it's clear that
the government

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:31.650
is very interested in
targeting individuals, as well,

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:33.357
in addition to
censoring content.

00:43:36.339 --> 00:43:39.818
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
it seems that China

00:43:39.818 --> 00:43:43.048
has its own version
of Twitter and things

00:43:43.048 --> 00:43:46.470
that Youku for YouTube
and Baidu for Google.

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:49.810
How much urgency do you
sense from Chinese users

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:54.993
to use the Western generated
products versus use their own,

00:43:54.993 --> 00:43:57.300
and have more
censorship on them.

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.554
Because I don't
sense a lot of need

00:43:59.554 --> 00:44:07.610
to use Google over Baidu but it
obviously [INAUDIBLE] search.

00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:08.360
JASON Q. NG: Yeah.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:11.050
Obviously, there are
hardcore folks within China

00:44:11.050 --> 00:44:14.650
who are very adamant about using
products that aren't censored.

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:16.369
So when Google did
pull out of China,

00:44:16.369 --> 00:44:18.660
you had people laying wreaths
and flowers at the Google

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:21.770
Office, because they were
really saddened by the fact

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:25.210
that a company like
Google left China,

00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:27.080
and now they were
forced to use products

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:29.510
like Baidu-- which if
you haven't used Baidu,

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:31.570
it's actually a pretty
good search tool

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:34.910
so long as you're not searching
for sensitive content.

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:43.590
So I think there are folks who
are very, very much into using

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:45.180
Twitter and YouTube
from within China.

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:47.040
And the thing is,
for the most part,

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.400
if you want to use Twitter
and Facebook within China,

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.970
you have the tools to allow
you to get access to them.

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:54.784
It's not like Iran
where sometimes they

00:44:54.784 --> 00:44:56.200
throttle the
internet to the point

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:58.320
where you can't use YouTube.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.310
You could actually
use-- well, now VPN's

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:03.344
a little more dicey
since it's harder to get.

00:45:03.344 --> 00:45:05.260
It's a good, solid VPN
that works for a while.

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:08.450
But you can use various
types of circumvention tools

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:10.650
to get access to YouTube,
Facebook, Twitter

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:12.990
from within China
if you want to.

00:45:12.990 --> 00:45:14.984
The thing is, most
folks-- why go

00:45:14.984 --> 00:45:16.900
on Twitter when all your
friends are on Weibo?

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:20.240
It's network effect, so
it's fairly entrenched

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:24.620
at this point, Weibo and
other sorts of social media.

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:27.920
So I think for the most
part, Chinese internet users,

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:30.910
some of them may actually
use domestic products out

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:31.950
of patriotism.

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:39.880
For the most, I think folks are
just-- not necessarily lazy,

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.000
but that's the
thing that loads up

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.339
when they can start their
computer, that's what they use.

00:45:46.339 --> 00:45:48.380
AUDIENCE: Just to follow
up about on the question

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:50.348
about people versus content.

00:45:50.348 --> 00:45:59.470
The way for the content
creators side [INAUDIBLE],

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:01.410
is there any sense,
especially given

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:03.587
that it's not just
the China-- you

00:46:03.587 --> 00:46:06.545
see global [INAUDIBLE]
metadata, data mining,

00:46:06.545 --> 00:46:09.496
and query analysis post facto.

00:46:09.496 --> 00:46:12.520
Is there any sense or
precedent that China

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:17.000
might be saving query
traffic across all users

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:22.960
to find who searched
for certain [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:24.430
browsing activity [INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:29.330
JASON Q. NG: Sure.

00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:31.280
So the question was--
again, going back

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:36.400
to whether the government
is tracking people

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:39.040
with regards, especially
to sucking up metadata,

00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:41.990
and whether or not
we think companies

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:45.930
like Sina or the government
are using this sort of metadata

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:50.020
as a way to figure out
who should be brought in

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:51.500
for questioning.

00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:56.720
So I certainly
don't have knowledge

00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:01.080
of metadata being used
in this sort of fashion.

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:04.880
I think from the sort
of anecdotal evidence

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.640
that we have, it's more
straight surveillance.

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:12.840
If they know that
your a activist,

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:16.220
they may get access to
your WeChat account,

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:18.570
and then start tracking
the messages you post.

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:20.080
And then when you
say, oh, I'm going

00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.500
to be having lunch at
the Chaoyang Square

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:26.827
or whatever, they send an
officer who follows you.

00:47:26.827 --> 00:47:28.410
And then you get
there, and you notice

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:30.910
how the officer is there, and
you wonder how they got there.

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:33.550
So that's the sort of thing
that I think their method

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:39.710
for tracking sensitive people.

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:44.870
As for figuring out-- from
the vast, big data who

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:46.460
might be terrorists
or whatever--

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:48.680
I'm sure that their
equivalent of the NSA

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:52.610
is doing the same sort of thing
that the NSA is doing here.

00:47:52.610 --> 00:47:56.710
But I don't know if individual
netizens who are just,

00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:58.380
like, looking at
pornography online

00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:00.782
should be worried that
they're metadata's

00:48:00.782 --> 00:48:02.740
going to be sucked up,
and then somehow they're

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:04.170
going to end up in prison.

00:48:04.170 --> 00:48:07.850
I think the Chinese
authorities--

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:09.800
they're efficient.

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:11.820
They know who they
should be focused on,

00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:16.150
and I think that's not
their primary target.

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:17.970
Yeah?

00:48:17.970 --> 00:48:21.510
AUDIENCE: A question just
referring to China's NSA,

00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:23.140
and we haven't really
talked much about

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:27.400
who [INAUDIBLE] this censorship.

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:31.676
I wonder if they're
just concentrated solely

00:48:31.676 --> 00:48:35.210
in the Propaganda Ministry
that has controls on this?

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:39.030
Or are there multiple
agencies or groups

00:48:39.030 --> 00:48:41.284
that are involved censorship
in China, from what

00:48:41.284 --> 00:48:43.530
you can infer from
your research?

00:48:43.530 --> 00:48:44.280
JASON Q. NG: Yeah.

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.630
So the question was
about who's actually

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:47.713
performing the sort of
censorship, what government

00:48:47.713 --> 00:48:50.420
agencies and/or
folks are involved.

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:53.170
And clearly, yeah,
it's something

00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:55.230
that's politically
driven in some ways.

00:48:55.230 --> 00:49:00.120
So you have this new bureau
called the State Internet

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:02.160
Information Office,
which is sort

00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:05.240
of an offshoot of the State
Council Information Office,

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:09.870
which is now supposedly the
lead figure for performing

00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:11.360
this sort of
information control.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.985
But you have all
these other ministries

00:49:12.985 --> 00:49:15.670
and bureaucracies
that are involved.

00:49:15.670 --> 00:49:18.260
But you also have not just
these multiple agencies

00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:20.600
and bureaucracies, but you
also to notice that there's

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:22.697
a national level of
information control,

00:49:22.697 --> 00:49:25.030
but then you also have local
officials who are involved.

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:26.790
You have police,
security bureaus,

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:29.850
and other folks who have
different interests than maybe

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:32.890
the national agents.

00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:35.325
So you have these
different layers.

00:49:35.325 --> 00:49:36.700
And then you throw
into that, you

00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:42.220
have private companies who have
a vested interest in preventing

00:49:42.220 --> 00:49:45.070
any sort of potentially even
sensitive discussion taking

00:49:45.070 --> 00:49:46.100
place on their site.

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:48.140
So you have another layer
of censorship there,

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:50.015
and then you have the
actual users themselves

00:49:50.015 --> 00:49:53.730
who have to self-censor,
who actually report

00:49:53.730 --> 00:49:55.910
on other users who are
posting provocative content.

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:57.680
So you have these
multiple layers,

00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:00.950
and it's not very clear.

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:05.110
It's not as simple as they're
doing it, or it's them.

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:08.540
It's very much a de-centralized,
diffused censorship system,

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:12.920
which is, I think, a feature
of the Chinese system.

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:19.460
All right, I think
everyone is too scared,

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:20.883
and we're going
to call it quits.

00:50:20.883 --> 00:50:23.190
All right, thanks so
much everyone for--

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:28.206
[APPLAUSE]
