00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.460
Let's get some more practice
doing implicit differentiation.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.240
So let's find the derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.790
We're going to assume
that y is a function of x.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.480
So let's apply our
derivative operator

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.560
to both sides of this equation.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.230
So let's apply our
derivative operator.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.820
And so first, on
the left hand side,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.290
we essentially are just going
to apply the chain rule.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.800
First we have the
derivative with respect

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.684
to x of x minus y squared.

00:00:28.684 --> 00:00:30.100
So the chain rule
tells us this is

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.299
going to be the derivative
of the something squared

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.300
with respect to the
something, which is just

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.090
going to be 2 times x
minus y to the first power.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.610
I won't write the
1 right over there.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.380
Times the derivative of the
something with respect to x.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.420
Well, the derivative of x
with respect to x is just 1,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.124
and the derivative
of y with respect

00:00:52.124 --> 00:00:53.790
to x, that's what
we're trying to solve.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.540
So it's going to
be 1 minus dy dx.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.157
Let me make it a
little bit clearer

00:01:00.157 --> 00:01:01.490
what I just did right over here.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.410
This right over here
is the derivative

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:12.000
of x minus y squared with
respect to x minus y.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.770
And then this right over
here is the derivative

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.710
of x minus y with respect to x.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.610
Just the chain rule.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.930
Now let's go to the right
hand side of this equation.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.510
This is going to be equal to
the derivative of x with respect

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.760
to x is 1.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.810
The derivative of y
with respect to x.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.350
We're just going to write
that as the derivative of y

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.565
with respect to x.

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:40.440
And then finally, the
derivative with respect

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.680
to x of a constant, that's
just going to be equal to 0.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.630
Now let's see if we can
solve for the derivative of y

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.610
with respect to x.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.477
So the most obvious thing to do.

00:01:53.477 --> 00:01:54.310
Let's make it clear.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:57.170
This right over here, I
can rewrite as 2x minus 2y.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.570
So let me do that so
I can save some space.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.050
This is 2x minus 2y If
I just distribute the 2.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.920
And now I can distribute
the 2x minus 2y

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.240
onto each of these terms.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.840
So 2x minus 2y times 1 is
just going to be 2x minus 2y.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.180
And then 2x minus 2y
times negative dy dx,

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.320
that's just going to be
negative 2x minus 2y.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.860
Or we could write that as
2y minus 2x times dy dx.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.320
Is equal to 1 plus dy dx.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.940
I'll do all my dy
dx's in orange now.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.480
1 plus dy dx.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.230
So now there's a
couple of things

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:49.950
that we could attempt to do.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.350
We could subtract 2x
minus 2y from both sides.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.640
So let's do that.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.510
So let's subtract 2x
minus 2y from both sides.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.230
So over here, we're going
to subtract 2x minus

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.410
2y from that side.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.660
And then we could also subtract
a dy dx from both sides,

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.940
so that all of our dy dx's
are on the left hand side,

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.680
and all of our non dy dx's
are on the right hand side.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.090
So let's do that.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:26.860
So we're going to subtract a
dy dx on the right and a dy dx

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.030
here on the left.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.380
And so what are we left with?

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.890
Well, on the left hand
side, these cancel out.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:40.940
And we're left with 2y minus
2x dy dx minus 1 dy dx,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.825
or just minus a dy dx.

00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:43.700
Let me make it clear.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.540
We could write this
as a minus 1 dy dx.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.650
So this is we can
essentially just add

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.110
these two coefficients.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.540
So this simplifies to 2y minus
2x minus 1 times the derivative

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.510
of y with respect
to x, which is going

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.850
to be equal to-- on this
side, this cancels out.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.104
We are left with 1
minus 2x plus 2y.

00:04:12.104 --> 00:04:13.270
So let me write it that way.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.529
Or we could write
this as-- so negative,

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.839
negative 2y is
just a positive 2y.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:23.150
And then we have minus 2x.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.030
And then we add that 1, plus 1.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.990
And now to solve
for dy dx, we just

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.760
have to divide both sides
by 2y minus 2x minus 1.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.200
And we are left
with-- we deserve

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.190
a little bit of a drum
roll at this point.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.981
As you can see, the
hardest part was really

00:04:36.981 --> 00:04:39.170
the algebra to solve for dy dx.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.550
We get the derivative
of y with respect

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:48.870
to x is equal to
2y minus 2x plus 1

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.210
over 2y minus 2x minus 1.
