00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.550
- [Instructor] In this
video we're going to dig

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.030
a little bit deeper into our knowledge

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.890
or our understanding of factoring.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.240
Now factoring is something
that we've been doing

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.330
for many years now.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.660
You can go all the way back
to when you were thinking

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.500
about how would I factor the number 12.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.000
Well I could write the number
12 as three times four.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.330
I could also write it as two times six.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.830
These are all legitimate factors.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.290
Or I could try to do a
prime factorization of 12,

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.355
where I'm trying to
write it as the product

00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:34.650
of you could view it as its
most basic constituents,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.230
which would be the prime numbers.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.690
And so we've done stuff like,
well 12 can be expressed

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.090
as two times six.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.820
Two is prime, but then
six can be expressed

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.660
as two times three.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.140
And so 12 could be expressed
as two times two times three,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.370
which we see right over here.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.720
This is all review, and this
would be a prime factorization.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.540
And we saw an analogue

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.790
when we first learned it in algebra I.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.180
In algebra I, we learned things like,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.170
and sometimes this might
be in a math I class

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.070
or even in a pre-algebra class,

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.148
you'll learn things like
hey, how do I factor

00:01:10.148 --> 00:01:13.770
x squared plus six x?

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.320
And you might recognize that hey,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.470
x squared could be rewritten as x times x,

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.220
and six x, that really
just means six times x.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.210
And so both of them have x as a factor,

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.040
and so we might wanna factor that out.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.230
And so we could rewrite
this entire expression

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.050
as x times x plus six.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.198
What we just did is we
factored out these x's

00:01:38.198 --> 00:01:40.920
that I am circling in blue.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.510
So in general, this idea of factoring,

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:44.630
if you're thinking about numbers,

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.840
you're writing one number as
the product of other numbers.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.260
If you're thinking about expressions,

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.220
you're writing an
expression as the product

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.920
of other expressions.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.770
Well now as we go a little bit
more advanced into algebra,

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.330
we're gonna start
thinking about doing this

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.390
with higher order expressions.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.610
So we've done it with just
an x or just an x squared,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.670
but now we're gonna start thinking about,

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.500
well what happens if we have
something to the third power,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.500
fourth power, sixth power,
10th power, 100th power?

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.650
But it's really the same ideas.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.280
And we could start with monomials,

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.540
which is fancy word
for just a single term.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.130
So let's say I had something
like six x to the seventh.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.610
What are the different ways
that I could factor this?

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.830
Pause this video and think about it.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.343
Can I express this as the
product of two other things?

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.043
Well, I could rewrite this
as this as being equal to

00:02:33.043 --> 00:02:38.043
two x to the third times what?

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.610
Well let's see, what do
I have to multiply two by

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.443
to get to six?

00:02:41.443 --> 00:02:42.760
I have to multiply it by three.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.590
And what do I have to
multiply x to the third by

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:45.660
to get to x to the seventh?

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.810
I could multiply it times
three x to the fourth.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.860
Notice, two times three is six,

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.100
x to the third times x to the
fourth is x to the seventh.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.440
We add exponents when we're multiplying,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.180
when we're multiplying
things with the same base.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.740
But this isn't the only way to factor.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.320
Just as we saw that three
times four wasn't the only way

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.500
to factor 12.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.840
You could also express this
as maybe being equal to

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.728
x to the sixth times what?

00:03:11.728 --> 00:03:15.570
Well, we would still have
to multiply by six then,

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.830
and then we'd have to
multiply by another x.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.970
So we could write this as
x to the sixth times six x.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.530
So there is oftentimes
multiple ways to factor

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.600
a higher degree monomial like this.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.700
And there is also an
analogue to doing something

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.090
like a prime factorization.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.410
When you're trying to really decompose,

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.030
rewrite this expression as a
product of it simplest parts.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.760
How would you do that
for six x to the seventh?

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.670
Well, you could rewrite that.

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.470
You could say six x to the seventh,

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.020
well that's equal to, we could
think about the six first.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.340
We know that the prime
factorization of six

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.280
is two times three, two times three.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.720
And then x to the
seventh is just seven x's

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.950
multiplied by each other.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.300
So times x times x

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.600
times x times x

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.160
times x, how many is that?

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.200
That's five, six, and seven.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.690
And so some of what we were doing,

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.680
when I said two x to the third,

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.920
what we really thought about is okay,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.550
I had a two, and then I
had x times x times x.

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.370
And then what do I have to multiply that?

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.370
Well I have to multiply that
by three x to the fourth.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.200
And as we will see, being
able to think about monomials

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.380
in this way will be useful for factoring

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.930
higher degree things
that aren't monomials,

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.660
things that are binomials, trinomials,

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.350
or polynomials in general.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.100
And we'll do that in future videos.
