00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.780
It sounds like Walters wrists
are getting better and

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.540
adding users is a big turning point for
the app congratulations.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.128
Whoa Laila you look terribly tired.

00:00:12.128 --> 00:00:15.760
Is everything okay,
when's the last time you slept?

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.820
&gt;&gt; Yeah it's been awhile.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.790
We do a lot more user data now but
I'm not sure it's anything to celebrate.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.270
Still struggling with just
exactly how to implement sharing.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.430
Walter asked for sorting data.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.330
And, well, that's pretty easy to
filter and sort our shopping lists.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.295
As it is it makes me think of bigger and
badder looming questions.

00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:40.720
&gt;&gt; And what are those?

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.520
&gt;&gt; I'm just I'm terrified about
what happens when we start getting

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.060
thousands of users.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.050
I know too many as it
isn't a problem right now.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.840
Heck it's even hard to
get my roommates and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.535
Nana to use the app
in its current state.

00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:57.825
But the decisions they make about
data now will affect the future.

00:00:57.825 --> 00:01:02.027
Our current model we made was
somewhat randomly put together.

00:01:02.027 --> 00:01:04.930
Without any rigorous
thinking about performance.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.100
I'm not even sure what the best way to
dissociate users and shopping lists is.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.076
&gt;&gt; Yeah I could see how
that could be stressful.

00:01:12.076 --> 00:01:16.549
Why don't you walk me through the exact
kind of functionality you are working on

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:18.180
in and worried about.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.657
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] Let me pull the wire frames.

00:01:21.657 --> 00:01:25.170
So we could have the settings activity
show different sorting options.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.850
And then on the items page,

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.690
we could differentiate between the
bought items and the non bought items.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.570
The bought items would
all be on the bottom and

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.690
crossed out instead
of mixed in randomly.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.940
As for how the data of the firebase
database itself should be organized,

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.080
I just don't know.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.530
Finally, I want to implement some
sort of sharing functionality.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.760
Right now all the lists are world
viewable which doesn't make a lot of

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.600
sense when we get tons of users.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.317
What I'd like to happen is
that the users can make lists.

00:01:53.317 --> 00:01:56.470
But they're private until
their shared with other users.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.615
&gt;&gt; Do you know what the sharing
flow will look like???

00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:02.975
&gt;&gt; So I was thinking something
like a user can add friends and

00:02:02.975 --> 00:02:04.660
then once a friend is added.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.120
They can click a little check mark box
to show whether the list is being shared

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.990
with that friend or not.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.970
And I was thinking of trying
to filter to allow for

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.240
basic auto complete functionality.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.380
&gt;&gt; Well the first part where
you sort of list sounds easy.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.670
Firebase has some basic filtering and
sorting function I built into it.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.290
So you shouldn't worry
too much about that.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.748
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] So what do you think?

00:02:26.748 --> 00:02:28.840
Can we tackle sorting?

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.980
I can make the UI screens.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.550
&gt;&gt; You know what,
why don't you take it easy for a bit.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.190
I'll chat with the developer
about sorting.
