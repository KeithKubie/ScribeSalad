00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.819
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So, good afternoon everyone.
Authors@Google New York is pleased to welcome

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.870
Eric Alterman, who is here today to talk about
his book, "Kabuki Democracy: The System vs.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.780
Barack Obama". Eric Alterman is a CUNY Distinguished
Professor of English and Journalism, a media

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.599
columnist at "The Nation", a Senior Fellow
at the Center for American Progress, an author

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.439
of seven books, including the national bestseller's
"What Liberal Media" and "The Book on Bush".

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.730
Please welcome Eric Alterman.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:23.810
[applause]

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.029
&gt;&gt;Eric Alterman: Hi.

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.250
&gt;&gt;audience 1: Hi.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:43.310
&gt;&gt;Eric Alterman: Thanks for having me. I got
somebody else’s notes up here. Let's see.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.030
Maybe their talk is better than mine.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.030
[laughter]

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.480
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I'll take those.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:56.330
&gt;&gt;Eric Alterman: OK, thank you. I spoke, for
my last book, I spoke in Mountain View. You

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:07.869
guys are much better looking, more fun, than
they are. So this book I wrote, "Kabuki Democracy",

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:19.380
it has, I meant to look this up from the last
time I talked about it, it has two separate

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:32.010
geneses, plural of genecii. Genesis. One is,
I had, Barack Obama invited me to dinner in

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.799
1980, 1980, 2005, right after he became a
Senator.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.390
And there was about seven or eight people
at dinner and I had no opinion of him, except

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.679
that I heard good things about him. I actually
didn't watch his convention speech. I played

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:49.619
poker that night. I was at the convention.
But I never watch the keynote speech because

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.659
I always find it frustrating that you end
up wishing that guy was a nominee.

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.319
It happened the first convention I went to
was 1984 with Mario Cuomo and ever since then

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:05.840
-- the one exception actually was Bill Clinton.
He was terrible at the keynote in 1988. But

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.780
anyway, so I had dinner with Obama and I'd
heard good things about him, but like I said

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.630
I didn't know anything at all about him except
that he was the only African American member

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.850
of the Senate and he had been a community
organizer.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.330
And I guess this happens to a lot of people.
I just was really struck by his normalcy.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.890
I was struck by his intelligence, by his self-confidence.
I guess you could call it 'charm'. I mean,

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.720
I was definitely charmed. But I was more struck
by how you could just talk to this guy who,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:48.370
at that point if you remember 2005, when Bush
defeated Kerry despite the war being in absolutely

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.500
terrible shape and the revelations at Abu
Ghraib. And all the horrible things that the

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.350
Bush Administration was doing, both in terms
of violating our values, but also straight

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:07.760
forward incompetence. The fact that the Democrats
could lose that election was really depressing.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.140
And just about the only thing, the only person,
that people took any hope from, at that point,

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:22.550
was this young guy from Chicago, Barack Obama.
And in fact, I remember he said that, and

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.340
again, this was very early in 1985, he said
that his very first press conference as a

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:34.720
Senator from Illinois, he was asked, "What
do you think your legacy will be?"

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.280
And he thought that was odd because he had
just, it was like his first day on the job.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:48.420
So he was under enormous pressure and a microscope.
And yet he talked about problems the way my

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:57.830
friends and I talked about problems. And we're
roughly the same age. I'm a little bit older

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.340
than he is, less than a year. And I came away
from that meeting buoyed, B-U-O-Y-E-D, buoyed

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.900
by meeting a politician who had been able
to navigate our political system, which is,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.009
has so many problems and so much built-in
corruption to it.

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:23.550
And to think that, I thought that maybe 20
years from now, he might be able to run for

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.940
President. And I was glad that I would be
alive for that. I figured unless I was hit

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.300
by a car, or killed as an innocent bystander.
I'm one of those people who always think I'll

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:42.289
be killed as an innocent bystander. So then,
so that's Genesis Number One.

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:49.469
Genesis Number Two, I had dinner with a friend
of mine who is also a funder and funds me

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:56.430
sometimes and says, "What would you like me
to fund?" And I was thinking that, I don't

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.110
know, I can't watch American politics in real
time. I find it too annoying and depressing

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.949
at the same time to listen to American politicians
speak.

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:11.939
They're so full of themselves and the language
that they use is so divorced from reality,

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:20.160
but also just from the language. It insults
me the way that the speeches that are given

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:27.939
in political talk. It bears out very much
to George Orwell's observation about political

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:33.460
speech being, I forget what he said, but it
had a lot to do with hot air, and I quote.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.749
Anyway, but I need to know what's going on
and I need to actually see these people sometimes.

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:42.900
So the solution to my problem, and it's a
very good one -- I recommend it -- is that

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:50.250
every morning I watch on DVR Colbert and Stewart.
And there, you get to see what people are

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:53.361
talking about. You get to see these actual
people and you don't have to see too much

00:05:53.361 --> 00:05:55.060
of them.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:00.840
You just get little snippets of them and I
can live with that. But the thing about watching

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.460
Colbert and Stewart, or just following the
news on a day to day, or on an hour to hour

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:15.590
basis, is that the way our media cover news
and in this I include all of our media. Media,

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.919
one thing I always have to point out when
I teach -- I'm a professor of English -- I

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:26.210
always have to remind people that the word
'media' is a plural noun. And that the proper

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.949
way to say 'media' is to say "the media are"
not "the media is". And it's very important

00:06:30.949 --> 00:06:36.120
because the media are an enormous amalgam
of different kinds of institutions that have

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.531
very little in common with one another. And
you can say, if you wanna blame the media,

00:06:40.531 --> 00:06:43.249
you can blame the media for almost anything
and it'll be true because there'll be some

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:46.740
aspect of the media that you'll be telling
the truth about.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.970
But it won't be true about most of the other
institutions. But one thing that does strike

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:59.199
me as true about just about all media is the
fact that they, these institutions, all hop

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:05.560
around from issue to issue, from day to day,
as if the previous day hadn't happened, as

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.150
if the previous problem hadn't happened. So
all of a sudden, everybody’s concerned about

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.199
oil drilling and the dangers of oil drilling,
offshore oil drilling.

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:22.779
Whereas the problems that created the conditions
that led to the Gulf of Mexico being inundated

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:27.729
with oil had been there for years. And if
you look back, if you go back and look at

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:32.789
all of the different decisions that went into
that, that went uncovered by any member of

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:40.419
the media, you could absolutely predict a
kind of disaster like the one we experienced

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:48.249
last year. And in fact, not a single media
institution, not one, had a reporter whose

00:07:48.249 --> 00:07:56.869
full-time job was to cover the MMS, the minerals
and whatever it’s called.

00:07:56.869 --> 00:08:01.029
And then, of course, we get a disaster and
everybody becomes an expert overnight on it.

00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:07.210
And the disaster lasts as long as it has news
value. And then we go on to the next disaster.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:19.029
So, we lurch from issue to issue. And every
night you can watch the news, or you can click

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:24.960
on your browser and get updates, or pick up
the newspaper if you're old fashioned, like

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:31.590
I am, in the morning, and become enormously
concerned about something that you had totally

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:36.140
forgotten about and will probably totally
forget about in 48 hours or 72 hours, or if

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:41.320
it's a terrorist attack you might get a couple
weeks out of it.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:47.560
So when I was asked what I would like to write
by my friend who willing to help pay for me

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:54.130
to do it, I said, "Well, I would like to take
some time and figure out why Barack Obama

00:08:54.130 --> 00:09:00.280
can't do most of the things. He can't do a
hundred percent of any of the things that

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:07.210
he promised to do, even though he had super
majorities in both Houses of Congress, number

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:13.520
one. But he can't even do most of the things
he promised to do.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:23.130
And the reasons are complicated. They're related
and they're not going away. In other words,

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:27.420
the coverage of them -- when something is
held up by a filibuster -- it took a long

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:35.620
time to get the gays in the military bill
passed, because of the filibuster, because

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:42.490
of individual holds and so forth. And eventually
it was passed in a special lame duck session

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:53.690
of Congress. But for years, it was held up
by these methods of obfuscation and delay

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:59.949
that are available to any Senator and again,
these things are used across the board on

00:09:59.949 --> 00:10:05.690
every issue of interest to any particular
special interest.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:13.940
And they tend to be ignored because our media
are not interested in the mechanics of how

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:19.079
our politics works. They're only interested
in the personalities and in the case of FOX

00:10:19.079 --> 00:10:25.600
and organizations like FOX and the ideology.
But actually the way the things actually work

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.079
and the interest behind them and the lobbyists
who are paying for the campaigns that determine

00:10:30.079 --> 00:10:34.130
the shape of things, determine the nature
of proposals, determine what gets in and out

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.130
of committee.

00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:39.459
These things are never covered. You have to
be a specialist to pay attention at least.

00:10:39.459 --> 00:10:47.380
So instead of allowing myself to be driven
crazy every morning, I decided to just take

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:54.240
notes on all of the different institutional
problems that I could identify that prevented

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:59.949
Barack Obama from making good on his campaign
promises, despite the fact that he had super

00:10:59.949 --> 00:11:00.949
majorities in both Congress.

00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:06.529
Because don't forget, if you elect a President,
if you have super majorities in both Congress

00:11:06.529 --> 00:11:11.089
and a President in the same party, you're
really working with an equivalent of a parliamentary

00:11:11.089 --> 00:11:16.110
system because it's not divided government
anymore. The opposition does not have the

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:21.779
power to prevent you from making your will
into law.

00:11:21.779 --> 00:11:27.839
And one problem, I mean, our Constitutional
system is set up to make passing laws very

00:11:27.839 --> 00:11:37.540
difficult in many respects for good reasons.
But in that sense, but because of that, there's

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:42.260
a disconnect between what politicians say
they will do and what we are able to hold

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:48.170
them responsible for having done. There's
always some excuse as to why they couldn't,

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:52.529
why you actually were stupid to believe what
they were promising you in the first place.

00:11:52.529 --> 00:11:57.649
But when you have super majorities in both
Houses, you lose that excuse. There's nothing

00:11:57.649 --> 00:12:04.750
standing in the way, theoretically, from the
entire panoply of Barack Obama's promises

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:14.079
being made into law. And those would include
a public option on healthcare, a very strong

00:12:14.079 --> 00:12:21.480
commitment, in this case, through a cap in
trade to curb global warming, much stronger

00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:30.100
support for unions through the card check
laws. And certainly, and this was the issue

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:35.389
that I thought was clearest, because healthcare
is very complicated and certainly environmental

00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:41.970
protection and global warming is very complicated,
but financial regulation was not complicated

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:42.970
in this case.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:46.769
I mean, it is complicated when you get into
the details, but what was uncomplicated about

00:12:46.769 --> 00:12:54.449
it was the politics that everybody understood
that the banks, with their own irresponsibility,

00:12:54.449 --> 00:12:58.920
had made a financial crisis that was much,
much worse than it ever needed to be, that

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:05.700
this had cost tens of thousands, perhaps hundreds
of thousands, of people their jobs, same number

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:14.720
of people their homes. The economy, because
of the hit that we were taking, was hemorrhaging

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:22.420
when Barack Obama came to power, 80,000 jobs
a month. And of course the stock market had

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:26.410
lost – I don't know -- about 30 percent
of its value, 20-30 percent of its value.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:31.769
It was an enormous crisis, the worst economic
crisis since the Great Depression. And we

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:37.670
knew not only who the culprits where, but
what the problem was. And the problem was

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:44.600
is that the system encouraged all kinds of
risk on behalf of certain people who controlled

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:51.449
enormous amounts of money at the banks. And
yet, there was no system built in for them

00:13:51.449 --> 00:13:55.870
to take responsibility for when those risks
went sour.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:14:03.060
Because they were too big to fail, they could
reap the rewards of the millions of dollars

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.180
they made when they made risky trades that
went all right, or looked all right. They

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:11.009
didn't go all right, but they looked all right
for a while. But when they went sour, the

00:14:11.009 --> 00:14:17.870
taxpayers had to pick up the bill. And so,
why wouldn't you do that? I mean if the house

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:21.860
is gonna give you all the money you need to
play poker, why wouldn't you just bet every

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.950
time and maybe your hand will turn out to
win? You've got nothing to lose.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:32.231
Well, there were a number of provisions in
the financial reform bill that would have

00:14:32.231 --> 00:14:39.009
prevented that from being the case in the
future, and none of them were able to be passed.

00:14:39.009 --> 00:14:44.320
So that we got a financial reform bill. It
actually – it surprised people. If you remember,

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.149
if you read the coverage carefully when the
bill was passed, people were surprised at

00:14:48.149 --> 00:14:56.579
how tough it was and it was tough because
the indictment of Goldman Sachs shined the

00:14:56.579 --> 00:15:02.660
spotlight on some of the practices that gave
certain Congressmen some extra courage that

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.500
they needed to vote in a way that surprised
people.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:12.950
But even so, none of the primary practices
that people identified as having caused the

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:19.259
crisis are we now protected from. They're
all gonna happen again because again, it’s

00:15:19.259 --> 00:15:24.730
just in the self-interest of the people running
the system to keep behaving that way. They're

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:32.709
still playing with the house's money. And
so, I tried to look deep into the system using

00:15:32.709 --> 00:15:40.069
the cases of the healthcare bill, of the cap
in trade bill, and of the financial reform

00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:41.069
bill.

00:15:41.069 --> 00:15:47.200
And I also spent a lot of time looking at
the causes of the oil spill from a regulatory

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:56.930
perspective. And I tried to identify all of
the different ways that the President is prevented

00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:01.940
from making good on his promises because I
submit that if you have a president who has

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.579
a super majority, who can't make good on his
promises, even with his majority, we don't

00:16:06.579 --> 00:16:08.629
really have a functioning democracy.

00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:12.970
Because when you vote for someone and he says,
"I'll do this," and nothing is preventing

00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:19.850
him from doing it and he still doesn't do
it, I mean, nothing apparently in the political

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:26.060
system, then your vote is, you're voting for
a fictional character. You're voting for someone

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:34.829
who can't. Your vote becomes a lot less meaningful
up to the point of being meaningless. And

00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:39.910
the answers are complicated. I mean, part
of the answers have to do with our Constitutional

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:44.040
system and are just about impossible to fix.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:52.870
If you live in California, your vote is worth
one-twelfth of what it is in Wyoming. Because

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:58.910
the same number, you get the same number of
Senators for twelve times the population,

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:04.709
as they do in Oregon. So, it just so happens
that the most conservative states in our country

00:17:04.709 --> 00:17:14.409
are the same, are the most under populated
states. So for instance, when you have a filibuster

00:17:14.409 --> 00:17:20.620
of 40 Senators, and remember, you don't even
have to have a filibuster anymore. You just

00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:22.090
have to say you would have filibustered.

00:17:22.090 --> 00:17:25.470
You don't have to bother to actually filibuster
anymore, like they do in the Jimmy Stewart

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:32.521
movies. Those are now, in part, black-and-white
movies. But if you say you're gonna filibuster

00:17:32.521 --> 00:17:41.159
something and you have the votes, which is
40 votes, you only really need to represent

00:17:41.159 --> 00:17:47.750
about barely 30 percent of the country. In
fact, the 40 Senators who did filibuster everything

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:54.049
that the Democrats proposed in the past two
years, did represent exactly 33 percent of

00:17:54.049 --> 00:17:55.049
the country.

00:17:55.049 --> 00:18:02.290
The Republicans, if you do the math, the 40
Senators we had in the 111th Congress represented

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:09.650
33 percent of the country. And that 33 percent
of the country could hold up the entire, the

00:18:09.650 --> 00:18:14.659
entire will of the majority on everything.
And that really can't be fixed because if

00:18:14.659 --> 00:18:20.280
you're part of that minority, you're gonna
like that. That's very good to have all that

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:26.299
power. Wyoming is not gonna voluntarily give
up its twelve times as much power in the Senate

00:18:26.299 --> 00:18:30.210
as California because it’s so difficult
to pass a Constitutional amendment, which

00:18:30.210 --> 00:18:32.659
is the only way to do it.

00:18:32.659 --> 00:18:39.940
It's not gonna happen. But in terms of the
rules of the Senate, that could easily change

00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:44.559
if the individual Senators were willing to
give up some of their personal prerogatives

00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:48.960
for either the good of democracy or just the
good of their team. And interestingly, the

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:54.030
Republicans are much better team players than
the Democrats. The Republicans realized with

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:58.330
Obama that they would only have any influence
if they stuck together one hundred percent

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.260
of the time as a complete unit.

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.659
And they did it. And so even people who didn't
agree with what the majority of their party

00:19:05.659 --> 00:19:10.190
wanted, stuck with it so that the next time
they wanted something, they would get it.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:13.210
Democrats are incapable of doing that. There
are a lot of reasons for that. In part, because

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:18.690
the Democratic Party is a much wider, ideological
party than the Republicans. But also because

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:22.640
the Republicans are meaner and nastier.

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:27.470
When people don't agree, when people don't
behave the way that their activists want,

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:31.299
they run primaries against them and sometimes
they beat them. And they beat them with the

00:19:31.299 --> 00:19:37.220
craziest people imaginable, like Christine
O'Donnell and Sharron Angle. And I use "crazy"

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:40.720
advisedly. I mean, this is gonna go up on
Google, right? So they can sue me if they

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.360
want. But I think I can prove that they're
nuts. I mean, if you listen to some of the

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.710
things they say, and they're not serious.

00:19:47.710 --> 00:19:53.130
I mean, in fact, if the Republicans hadn't
run Angle or O'Donnell and a couple of others,

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:58.360
they would've taken over the Senate. They
ran not credible candidates and they're willing

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:05.850
to, they're willing to punish their own members
on behalf of party unity, to that degree,

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:11.610
to a way that there were no Democratic challenges
to any of the Democrats who didn't support

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:15.770
Obama on healthcare, for instance. Whereas,
if the situation had been reversed, it would've

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:16.770
been an upset.

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:21.740
There's a story I tell where there was this
fellow. Obama -- it wasn't clear, once the

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:27.130
whole healthcare thing came down, the tough
vote was gonna be in the House, not in the

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:31.260
Senate, if you remember the really close vote.
And it wasn't clear how in the world Nancy

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.750
Pelosi was gonna get those votes and she ended
up having to give away the right to, the right

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:40.880
to choice in your healthcare plan, which was
really surprising that Democrats go along

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.880
with that.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.399
I'm glad they did; I think it was the right
thing. But still, it's hard to get every little

00:20:45.399 --> 00:20:53.190
faction to go along with you. So, at the same
time, the Republicans were incredibly self-disciplined

00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:59.950
in terms of how their members behaved. And
remember, at the end of a session of Congress,

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:04.470
the people in Congress who are all ambitious
beyond being their Congressmen, they're all

00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:05.980
planning their next move. Some of them are
gonna want to run for Senator, some of them

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:15.820
will run for Governor, one might want to be
mayor of the large town in their districts.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:23.429
So the Republicans. They would punish anyone
who, who, who made plans not to be there for

00:21:23.429 --> 00:21:28.470
any important vote for any reason. It didn't
matter what the reason was. The Democrats

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:36.409
had this representative from Hawaii, named
Neil Abercrombie, who ran for Governor. And

00:21:36.409 --> 00:21:43.320
in order to run for Governor, he quit his
seat in Congress right before the vote on

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.190
healthcare. And what did the Democrats do?
They gave him a going away party. And you

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:48.190
know what?

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:51.779
He didn't even bother to show up. He was already
in Hawaii. They had a party without him to

00:21:51.779 --> 00:21:59.020
celebrate the fact that they, that they just
didn't have any ability to discipline their

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:04.720
members. So, that's a cultural problem that
is very frustrating and it's hard to know

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:09.179
what to do about. And it’s difficult for
citizens to do anything about that except

00:22:09.179 --> 00:22:14.059
to punish their representatives. But again,
I don't even know how you would go about doing

00:22:14.059 --> 00:22:15.059
that.

00:22:15.059 --> 00:22:16.059
[pause]

00:22:16.059 --> 00:22:24.800
One of the most significant road blocks to
democracy in present day America that doesn't

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:31.919
get talked about much though, is the power
and culture of finance. It's not simply that

00:22:31.919 --> 00:22:38.230
lobbyists pay for political campaigns and
then get the members to vote the way they

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:42.149
want, or not even to vote the way they want,
but to kill bills before they're voted on,

00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:47.271
or to be playing golf on the day that the
vote is taking place or to change the language

00:22:47.271 --> 00:22:52.159
in a way that nobody else can understand it,
but gives them what they want, which is an

00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:58.390
awful lot of what happened with the financial
reform bill. But there's a culture.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:06.620
The Italian Communist philosopher who was
imprisoned during World War II, Antonio Gramsci,

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:15.390
talked about the way that ruling classes use
culture to get people to do things in the

00:23:15.390 --> 00:23:21.510
interest of the ruling class without resorting
to force. And people don't even, it becomes

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:26.559
second nature to them. And this is the genius
of these ruling class because it’s a lot

00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:30.640
cheaper. It's simpler, to do things that way.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:38.080
And if you look at the way the ideology of
finance and laissez faire economics has overturned

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:46.049
what had been about a half century of Keynesianism
over the past 40 years, you can see the power

00:23:46.049 --> 00:23:53.110
of cultural finance operating in our political
system so that any government intervention

00:23:53.110 --> 00:24:01.659
for any reason has to be justified in the
context of an ideology that is deeply antithetical

00:24:01.659 --> 00:24:04.270
to the very idea of government intervention.

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:09.720
I mean, today we have people like Alan Greenspan
and Paul Volcker saying they went much too

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:15.220
far and they had much too much faith in the
system and they now regret they didn't see

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:23.140
that the system wasn't perfect and needed,
needed some sort of adult supervision. But

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:29.260
it’s very, very difficult for anyone in
power, they said this long after they were

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:34.830
no longer Chief of the Fed or Secretary of
Treasury. But it's very difficult for anyone

00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:42.269
in power to make a statement like that because
it, it, it makes them appear untrustworthy

00:24:42.269 --> 00:24:45.110
to the entire system and there's just no point
in it.

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:50.059
There's just no point in trying to poke holes
in this ideology that is so widely accepted,

00:24:50.059 --> 00:24:58.271
taught in business schools, permeates the
business sections of all the newspapers and

00:24:58.271 --> 00:25:05.330
actually goes much deeper than that. And what
the system does, is it raises a private concerns

00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:13.519
to the equal, or even more important, to public
concerns in public policy-making. So that

00:25:13.519 --> 00:25:18.169
the lobbyists, the lobbyists, individual lobbyists
for individual companies, their interest is

00:25:18.169 --> 00:25:24.200
seen as, as important, if not more important,
than the broader public.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:33.789
And so, for instance, during the finance negotiations,
Goldman Sachs hired away the chief of the

00:25:33.789 --> 00:25:39.289
House Banking Committee, who was working for
Barney Frank, who's a big liberal Democrat.

00:25:39.289 --> 00:25:43.900
They hired him away during the negotiations.
And nobody thought there was anything wrong

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:50.920
with that. That you can move from representing
the public interest to the private interest

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:54.720
on the very same time you can basically switch
sides in the fight.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.890
I mean, think about it. The guy who was writing
the bill that was regulating Goldman Sachs

00:25:58.890 --> 00:26:03.150
one day, is working for Goldman Sachs the
next day. There's no law against it. There's

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:12.029
not even any cultural, social disapproval
of it. Everyone who works for the House Banking

00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:17.990
Committee and who works for the Senate Finance
Committee either will work for one of these

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:22.720
banks or has worked for one of these banks
and probably both. Probably has and probably

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:23.720
will again.

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:24.720
[hits microphone]

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:27.850
Sorry. Probably will again. And that's just
the way it is. I mean, and if you think about

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:34.220
it from their perspective, well, why not?
It's very difficult to maintain one's idealism

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:39.179
when one goes to Washington in one's 20s to
try and change the world. And yet, you see

00:26:39.179 --> 00:26:43.770
the same people who you grew up with and went
to school with and socialized with and they're

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:49.649
making three, five, ten times what you're
making for doing essentially the same work.

00:26:49.649 --> 00:26:53.510
And they have a lot more freedom and they're
picking up the check at dinner and you're

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:56.640
feeling like a loser. And then they offer
you the opportunity to live that life.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.899
And why not? There's no sanction against it.
Nobody's gonna look down on it. You can have

00:27:00.899 --> 00:27:08.990
all the things that your, that you'd like
to give your family. I mean, if you're a Mexican

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:14.570
policeman and the drug dealers come to you
and say, "We're either gonna kill you or give

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:19.620
you a million dollars", you can understand
why you would work with the drug dealers rather

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:26.390
than have yourself killed or your family killed.
It's a brutal world out there.

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:32.190
In the United States, we have a much more
pleasant choice, which is you can work 20

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:38.280
hours a week in a little cubicle for 110,000
dollars a year, or we can give you an office

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:44.600
with a staff and a car and a credit card and
we'll pay you 750,000 dollars a year. And

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:49.630
people will like you better. People will think
you're cooler than you were. It’s just very

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:55.890
hard to resist and as long as the culture
treats it as OK, then there's no reason not

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:56.890
to do it.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:01.870
So both the ideology and the culture of the
way we treat money in our society becomes

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:07.090
so powerful that the public interest becomes
entirely lost. So, right now, I mean, you

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:14.320
had, you had the entire country mad at these
guys, really wanting A) punishment, and B)

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:20.750
preventative medicine. And you couldn't get
it. You could only get about ten percent of

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:25.549
what was needed and that was then. The rules
are still being written today.

00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:30.649
The rules, I mean, the language is very high
falutin' in these laws. So -- but the actual

00:28:30.649 --> 00:28:33.980
rules are very detailed and those are all
being written without any public scrutiny

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:39.610
whatsoever. There were no reporters there.
So the lobbyists are still there and they're

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:44.080
getting what they want and that's how the
system worked. Now finally, I've talked a

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:50.010
little bit longer than I intended. But finally
you have the transformation of the media that's

00:28:50.010 --> 00:28:52.130
taken place in the past 20 or 30 years.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:56.029
I've written a few books about this and I
don't wanna make my talk entirely about that.

00:28:56.029 --> 00:29:01.279
But it has two basic components. One is, is
the growth of the alternative conservative

00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:10.080
media, FOX News, cable news, Rush Limbaugh,
Drudge, the internet. And these have put enormous

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:15.760
pressure on what used to be the establishment
news because these people are profitable and

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.990
their, their viewers are really dedicated.

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:24.260
So even though not that many people watch
FOX, I mean, a lot of people watch FOX compared

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:31.560
to CNN and MSNBC. They have more viewers than
both of those stations combined. But it's

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:37.000
only still two, three million people in a
country of 300 million people. It's not that

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.950
many people. But they carry enormous influence
inside the universe of the news media because

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:49.559
they've created a successful model when the
rest of the media appear to be dying.

00:29:49.559 --> 00:29:56.120
So, FOX and the conservatives have gotten
more and more powerful in terms of defining

00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:02.800
the playing field of how we debate things,
how we discuss things. The idea that you can

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:07.090
talk about death panels and have it be credible,
when there isn't any evidence for it at all,

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:11.130
but it becomes a real issue that the President
has to address. Or, something like ACORN.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:16.510
I spent a lot of time on the ACORN issue here
because it's just crazy that George Stephanopoulos

00:30:16.510 --> 00:30:21.950
would think that it was worth asking the President
about ACORN during their interview right before

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:29.380
he was getting to the Afghanistan war. The
government, US government budget, if you take

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:34.130
the whole year of the budget, it would spend
15 seconds on what goes to ACORN. It would

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:36.899
have. Now nothing goes. But it was 15 seconds
worth of it.

00:30:36.899 --> 00:30:41.309
The President doesn't think about things like
that. But the issue became so important because

00:30:41.309 --> 00:30:50.950
of the ginning up of this machine. That is,
you see the tip of the submarine in FOX News

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:57.770
and it’s a very important part of it. But
what I try to point out about FOX News that's

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:02.549
really important to notice is that it's not
a news organization. It's a political organization.

00:31:02.549 --> 00:31:10.549
It's a lot like what Berlusconi has in Italy.
It's just that the head of it is not the same

00:31:10.549 --> 00:31:12.029
head as the President.

00:31:12.029 --> 00:31:18.340
But for instance, right now, every single,
with the exception of Mitt Romney, every single

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:24.770
Republican presidential candidate who is not
in public office, is on the payroll of FOX

00:31:24.770 --> 00:31:30.179
News. So they're getting the equivalent, I
think in the last year if you made them pay

00:31:30.179 --> 00:31:34.850
for the airtime they get at FOX News, FOX
News made a 60 million dollar contribution

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:41.220
to their campaigns. And they never get any
tough questions. They're just there basically

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.220
campaigning.

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:46.920
And the opposite works as well. The way FOX
News describes, and Rush Limbaugh and the

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:57.340
entire structure, describes the opposition.
Is it weird that 24 percent of registered

00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:02.330
Republicans think that Barack Obama not only
is a Muslim, but has actually tried to turn

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:07.480
the United States into an Islamic republic?
Really. Twenty-four percent of Republicans,

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.429
eighteen percent.

00:32:09.429 --> 00:32:13.040
That number keeps rising, just like the number
of people who think that global warming is

00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:20.360
a hoax, has risen since the President, since
the 2008 election. That's problem one. Problem

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:27.840
two is that as, I mean it's ironic that I'm
saying this here at Google, as I'm sure you've

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:33.929
all heard, the economic model for the news
media has broken down and it’s no longer

00:32:33.929 --> 00:32:35.240
a business.

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:41.660
Newspapers are no longer a business. Television
news is no longer a business. There are some

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:47.720
niche products that are good businesses on
the internet. But they're very few and far

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:56.169
between and there's no formula. The old formula
is, you aggregate eyeballs and you sell those

00:32:56.169 --> 00:33:01.299
eyeballs to advertisers and the actual eyeballs
pay a very small portion of the freight.

00:33:01.299 --> 00:33:07.210
The last time I checked, and this is probably
not the case anymore because of the destruction

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:12.290
of these news organizations, but a New York
Times, if you took all the readers of the

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:19.870
New York Times and you took all the production
costs of creating the New York Times, particularly

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:24.120
the reporting and editing, you'd have to charge
people 40 dollars a newspaper to pay, to cover

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:25.120
those costs.

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.779
And so, the difference between two dollars
a newspaper and 40 dollars a newspaper is

00:33:27.779 --> 00:33:33.790
advertising money that pays to reach those
people. Well, that, that, those advertisers

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:40.919
are disappearing for a lot of reasons, which
you don't need me to explain to you. That's

00:33:40.919 --> 00:33:43.929
why you guys have this nice place here.

00:33:43.929 --> 00:33:44.929
[pause]

00:33:44.929 --> 00:33:51.269
So at the same time you have all these new
irresponsible forms of journalism brewing,

00:33:51.269 --> 00:33:56.690
you have the formally responsible forms of
journalism dying.

00:33:56.690 --> 00:34:01.130
Now I don't wanna, I'm not one of those people
who says this is all a terrible thing. I think

00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:05.179
there are a lot of really excellent and wonderful
and democratic things that have arisen from

00:34:05.179 --> 00:34:06.470
the digitization of communications in news,
in particular. I make my living, by and large,

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:11.569
on the internet. I think it's great. I have
much close communication with my readers and

00:34:11.569 --> 00:34:21.000
I learn things. I learn a lot more about things
much more easily than I ever could have and

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.030
I know a lot more as a result.

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:27.389
And to the degree that people participate
in digital democracy, it's a much better democracy

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:32.510
than, than we have, particularly in terms
of information. But the cost of it is that

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:44.159
we allow all kinds of nonsense and chicanery
and jingoism and -- well, I can use a lot

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:50.970
of unpleasant words here -- to go unchecked
because the gatekeeper function has been destroyed.

00:34:50.970 --> 00:34:56.530
And so, a president who is trying to make
a case on something as complicated as cap

00:34:56.530 --> 00:35:02.070
in trade or healthcare, no longer has the
ability to reach the public with a complicated

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:08.130
case. Everything has to be stated in really
catchy, really quick phrases that face a mountain

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:16.800
of disinformation that feels no responsibility
at all to correct itself, to give a fair hearing

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.800
to the truth.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:20.920
I could give you an example. This is what
you learn by watching the Daily Show. But

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:25.170
I could give you example after example after
example of these cable stations -- and it’s

00:35:25.170 --> 00:35:29.490
not only FOX News -- of just saying things
that are flat out untrue, that are obviously

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:35.290
not true. I mean, you all must have noticed
that story about how Barack Obama spent like

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:38.700
200 million dollars a day going to India or
something.

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:45.230
The source -- this ran everywhere, but the
source was an unnamed, local, regional official

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:49.510
in India, who would have no idea. And then
somebody quoted somebody once, and it’s

00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:54.010
picked up and this machine takes it over.
And then it becomes, it crowds out all the

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:59.180
rest of the news so that anything that the
President or his side wants to say, can't

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:07.210
be heard. So at the end of the book, I try
and be constructive and make a series of proposals,

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:08.790
over how to counter these things.

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:13.150
But what I -- my primary argument is that
for people to take a look at the whole system

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:17.890
and see that the system, because of the power
of money, because of the dysfunction of our

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:22.750
institutions and because of the transformation
of the media, it's really no longer has a

00:36:22.750 --> 00:36:27.089
substance of democracy. It's become a kind
of Kabuki democracy, where, and sometimes

00:36:27.089 --> 00:36:31.810
people tell me I'm misusing the word 'Kabuki'
and that I'm unfair to Kabuki Theater. But

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:35.089
it seems to be consistent with people's idea
of Kabuki, at least mine.

00:36:35.089 --> 00:36:39.960
Which is, that people are sort of acting,
going through the motions, without any of

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:47.180
the substance, without any of the actual dialogue
and pretending to have a democracy without

00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:51.940
the most fundamental aspect of it, being the
case, which is that people's vote actually

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:55.800
has the ability to change the system. It's
not people's vote. It's people's money. It's

00:36:55.800 --> 00:37:02.569
people's influence. And it's people's willingness
to behave responsibly in support of their

00:37:02.569 --> 00:37:03.569
goals.

00:37:03.569 --> 00:37:12.400
And with the transformation of our politics
in the extreme direction that it's gone in,

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:25.830
and the rewards for that extremism, this problem's
only gonna get worse unless we start to take

00:37:25.830 --> 00:37:57.020
it seriously. So even though it's complicated
and it takes a long time to explain, I personally

00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:04.100
don't think we can continue to act as if it
isn't there. So thanks for listening.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:05.100
[applause]

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.100
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: All right. Questions?
Did anyone have any questions? Step up to

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.100
the microphone.

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.100
[pause]

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:09.100
&gt;&gt;Eric Alterman: Sure, thank you.

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:10.100
&gt;&gt;Female Audience Member #1: You mentioned
the difference between the Republican Party

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.100
and the Democratic Party and the discipline
that the Republican Party has. What do you

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:16.750
think is best for our country? Because on
one hand, you've got the Republican Party

00:38:16.750 --> 00:38:20.210
that seems to be more efficient. But on the
other hand, you've got the Democratic Party

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:21.210
that seems to believe in the exchange of ideas,
ideals and not forcing one person to go with

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:22.210
the bigger party.

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:24.180
&gt;&gt;Eric Alterman: Well, good question. The
Republicans have basically purged their moderates

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:30.390
from their party. And they're becoming an
ideological party, a conservative party. That's

00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:38.190
why there's almost no Republicans in the Northeast,
in New England, anymore. And then, no Democrats

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:44.260
anymore in the South. There's about three
or four remaining dinosaurs in the Republican

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:53.650
Party, like Olympia Snow, and a couple others
in New England. And they will lose their seats

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:54.650
shortly.

00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:59.890
So the Republican Party is a party that is
answerable to its activist wing. And if they

00:38:59.890 --> 00:39:06.520
don't toe the line, they're shot down and
the Democrats are not. The Democrats are an

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:10.530
establishment party, and by and large, a centrist
party. By and large, they're always trying

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:16.150
to find what the swing voter wants and give
it to them and ask their activists just to

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:18.050
keep quiet and wait their turn.

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:23.830
And if you notice, Barack Obama and his advisors
are always making fun of Liberals and saying,

00:39:23.830 --> 00:39:28.570
"Oh, they're whining about not getting everything
they wanted." Whereas Republicans never do

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:34.470
that. Republicans are very respectful on their
base, no matter now crazy they are. Now, in

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:39.430
a parliamentary, parliamentary system, you
would want parties like Republican parties

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:43.730
so that everybody's interest could be fairly
represented.

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:52.010
So if I happen to have this particular group
of -- like, in Israel you've got all these

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:56.430
little parties that represent very particular
points of view. You've got like, a dozen parties.

00:39:56.430 --> 00:40:03.890
And the only, the only -- they each get to
get five percent. They have a threshold of

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:10.109
five percent to be seated in the Parliament.
But in our system, you've got a winner take

00:40:10.109 --> 00:40:18.609
all system where, where, where if you get
one vote more than the other side gets, you

00:40:18.609 --> 00:40:22.849
get all of the seats. You get, you get the
entire Presidency.

00:40:22.849 --> 00:40:28.359
You don't even need a majority. You just need
one vote more than anybody else. So it doesn't

00:40:28.359 --> 00:40:36.080
make any sense to have anything to try and
make your party as small and ideological as

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:43.230
you can in terms of winning. You wanna have
a broad coalition to win and then fight it

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:48.510
out once you've won. The problem with that,
and I think it's a clear problem for the Democrats,

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:53.589
is that if you have all of these disparate
people with disagreements in your party, it's

00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:56.359
very hard to say what you stand for, right?

00:40:56.359 --> 00:41:00.069
So we know what Republicans believe in. We
know what Conservatives believe in. Small

00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:09.790
government, less taxes, fewer immigrants,
kick ass in the rest of the world, no making

00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:17.089
nice with other countries that give us a hard
time. But what do the Democrats believe? I

00:41:17.089 --> 00:41:23.940
don't think anybody can really explain it.
So because our politics are so personalized,

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.810
people like to vote for the stronger sounding
person.

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:30.770
You have to be really crazy to be too crazy
to get elected in this country if you're,

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:34.970
if you sound like you know what you're talking
about. So the Republicans have actually stepped

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:39.510
over, because of the Tea Party, they've managed
to step over that line a little bit in the

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:45.040
last election. But I think that, it's my impression,
and this is just a feeling, this is just a

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:48.900
feeling, but I think it's true, I've been
watching this stuff for 30, 40 years.

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:53.119
I think Americans admire people who know what
they stand for, who can articulate it, and

00:41:53.119 --> 00:41:58.619
who can speak for it in a strong way without
hemming and hawing. And that's more important

00:41:58.619 --> 00:42:02.730
to them than whether or not they actually
agree with what the person's saying. Just

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:05.980
that they vote much more on the strength of
personality than they do on the issues. They

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:07.680
don't pay that much attention to the issues.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:12.980
So I think the Democrats will be much better
off with a stronger, more focused, more logical

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:17.430
party than they are with the party they have
today, more like the Republicans. I think

00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:22.690
the Republicans make more sense. But you could
make an argument for the other side, and they

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:24.171
might be right, too. It's a very tough question.
Thank you.

00:42:24.171 --> 00:42:26.480
[pause]

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:47.390
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #1: First of all, thank
you for speaking today. And second, you said

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:48.390
at the end of your talk that we need to take
things more seriously. And given the systemic

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:50.930
difficulties that we have, and the fact that,
like you said, the President, well, the President

00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:59.640
just named his Chief of Staff as someone who
came from the financial industry. So any lessons

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.470
around the economic problems that we've had
are seemingly lost. And how do we, you said

00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:12.520
we had to take it more seriously and take
our democracy more seriously. So what ways

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:17.450
do you suggest that we do that and what is
available to us?

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:20.280
&gt;&gt;Eric Alterman: Oh, boy. Well, I do try and
address that in the conclusion of my book.

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:25.290
And it's long and I don't really have any
simple answers for that. But I think that

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:33.950
with, what the right has done over the past
40 years is to move the center in their direction.

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:39.950
So that, I mean, Barack Obama. Not only did
he choose a guy from the financial industry,

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:45.470
William Daley, but he chose a guy who didn't
support his healthcare program; the most important,

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:48.930
the thing he should be proudest of, the thing
he put most of his time in, the thing that

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:55.840
his presidency will rise and fall on in terms
of what are his signal accomplishments.

00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:01.630
He picked a guy who was against all that.
And he did it because the narrative demanded

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:06.450
that he move to the center, that he be more
friendly to business. Now remember, business

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:11.839
got 90 percent of what it wanted out of the
financial bill. They defined the shape of

00:44:11.839 --> 00:44:16.309
the healthcare bill. They defeated cap in
trade. And yet Obama is perceived as being

00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:17.309
anti-business.

00:44:17.309 --> 00:44:22.700
In fact, I would say, I know numbers about
30 percent of people consider Obama to be

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:27.880
a socialist, as if we somehow elected a Socialist
to be our President. This is, this is the

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:35.750
power of the right-wing media and conservative
institutions who began this process in the

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:41.309
early 1970s to redefine the playing field
in American politics, and they have succeeded.

00:44:41.309 --> 00:44:47.661
And before anything could really be accomplished
on the kinds of issues that you raise, the

00:44:47.661 --> 00:44:54.089
other side needs to organize itself for a
long-term battle of ideas in the same way.

00:44:54.089 --> 00:44:58.170
And those investments need to be made. Most
of the funders in the Democratic Party now

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:07.970
are the kinds of people who have founded Google
and Silicon Valley institutions, entrepreneurs.

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:10.170
And I have nothing at all against entrepreneurs.

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:18.200
They're very important. Where would we be
without them? But they want results. They

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:23.200
want quarterly results or maybe annual results
at best. And these investments take decades

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:26.480
and the Republicans have spent, they've wasted
a lot of money, they're conservatives. They've

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:32.619
wasted a lot of money building their structures
because it’s hard to know what will work.

00:45:32.619 --> 00:45:34.140
It's impossible to know what will work and
you gotta give things time.

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:41.620
And when you think about it from an entrepreneurial
standpoint, an awful lot of angel money goes

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:47.609
out the window over time. But the one thing
that sticks pays for everything else. And

00:45:47.609 --> 00:45:53.250
yet, in politics, this money is expected to
show results overnight and so that groups

00:45:53.250 --> 00:46:00.020
like the Democracy Alliance, which is all
these Democratic billionaires and millionaires,

00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:05.020
who've committed a certain number, 800,000
dollars I think, each over a period of, I

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:09.650
don't know exactly what the period is, but
a lot of money.

00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:15.660
They have a structure that demands all kinds
of benchmarks be met that are just not that

00:46:15.660 --> 00:46:20.890
appropriate to business, but not appropriate
to the world of ideas. And so, the first thing

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:26.460
I would ask for would be patient investing
in ideas. That would be number one. And then

00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:35.740
number two, I would ask for less caution,
less fear, to give voice to one's ideas. That

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:41.740
not, just to, you can take back what you said
if it turns out you were wrong. But there's

00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:44.410
so much nervousness about being the target.

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:49.440
I mean, when the Gulf War happened, Bill O'Reilly
put my picture up on the television screen

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:56.910
as a mug shot 'cause I opposed the Gulf War.
Like, I was supposed to, I was guilty of something,

00:46:56.910 --> 00:47:02.810
of having a difference of opinion with FOX
News. And I was fine with that because I don't

00:47:02.810 --> 00:47:07.610
make my living on whether or not FOX News
likes me. And none of my friends were gonna

00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:08.610
stop being friends with me and I was gonna
keep getting invited to parties.

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:15.130
Like, it didn't hurt me in any way and actually,
I enjoyed it. But if you're in, if you're

00:47:15.130 --> 00:47:23.960
not, if you're in the real world, it can be
really scary. It can be a real problem for

00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:30.750
you, particularly as they get meaner and meaner
and occasionally, people get shot or get threatened.

00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:33.650
One of my colleagues at CUNY is now the target
of a Glenn Beck attack. That is quite scary.

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:38.140
The New York Times wrote an article about
it this week, about how she's getting death

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:39.140
threats and Beck is using really incendiary
language about her.

00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:44.470
And she's just writing articles about politics.
So we need a little bit more courage and we

00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:51.350
need a longer term investment. And we need
to, we need to ape their ability to discipline

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:56.170
themselves. That would be, I guess, the three
broad categories. Thank you.

00:47:56.170 --> 00:47:57.170
[pause]

00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:58.170
OK?

00:47:58.170 --> 00:48:00.599
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yes.

00:48:00.599 --> 00:48:03.720
&gt;&gt;Eric Alterman: Well, thanks for listening.
I enjoyed it. Thank you very much for having

00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:04.720
me.

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:04.721
[applause]
