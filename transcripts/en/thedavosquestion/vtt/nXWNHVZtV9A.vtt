My name is Supa Mandiwanzira. I'm the chief
executive of Mighty Movies TV Production Company

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.870
in Zimbabwe. I think that the 2010 World Cup
will not only benefit South Africa, I think

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.090
it will benefit the region. But much of the
economic benefits will be found in South Africa

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.970
certainly because most of the people who will
be coming for the World Cup will becoming

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.030
to visit South Africa. Some may visit some
original countries, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mallow,

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:32.119
and other countries that have fantastic tourist
attractions in the region. But what is important

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:37.609
also is that the focus on Africa will help
change the image of Africa across the world,

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:42.940
because there's a negative image about Africa.
Much of it is perception. It's actually not

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.570
a reality. But having the word media which
is coming to cover the football, and a whole

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.989
lot of people from outside the African continent,
will see for themselves that Africa is not

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.570
what it perceived out there. That Africa is
far much ahead then what they actually think

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.219
it is in terms of development, in terms of
opportunity, in terms of going forward. Thank

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.329
you.
