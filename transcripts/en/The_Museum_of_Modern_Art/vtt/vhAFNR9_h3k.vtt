My name is Juliet Kinchin, and I'm curator
of modern design in the Department of Architecture

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.269
and Design in the Museum of Modern Art.

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:17.950
And the key object in the section I'm curating
is a model of a prefabricated Little Farms

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.900
Unit from 1932.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.420
What we're looking at is a design for a composite
prefabricated farm unit which brought together

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:39.630
five elements; animal pens, greenhouses, a
packing area and silo and living quarters

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.970
for the--for the farmer.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.960
We’re at the height of the Great Depression.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:53.540
And people are talking in many different contexts
about the farm, both as the root of complex

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.320
problems and urbanization and agricultural
slump.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:07.490
But also as possibly the way forward out of
this really dire moment in the American economy.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:17.740
The initial project was defined by Walter
Davidson in great detail in a letter to Frank

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.549
Lloyd Wright, with which he sent a couple
of drawings, very detailed plans, both for

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.700
a Little Farms Unit and a related market system.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.380
And we can see these drawings, which I think
are possibly Davidson's.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:45.780
He was one of a whole generations of specialists
called efficiency experts and packaging engineers.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.110
He really understood how to shift large quantities
of produce.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:02.369
This project is about bringing the farm into
the modern, the modern day, combining modern

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.979
technology, modern ways of building through
pre fabricating and cheap steel, and introducing

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:17.480
these new transformative clean forms of energy
like electricity rather than polluting chemicals.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:26.280
But it was also about planning the farm in
this compact, small-scale way.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:34.330
So rather than having these functions dispersed
in separate buildings, you have one composite

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:44.260
unit, which Wright envisioned as being slightly
reconfigured with these geometric elements

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.430
to suit changes in the local terrain.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:56.989
You can see the elements of the Little Farm's
vision and the Wayside Market's vision are

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:05.960
completely subsumed into Frank Lloyd Wright's
descriptions and vision of Broadacre City.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:16.440
The key to this whole idea was the idea that
this network, this tract of about 200 farms,

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:24.930
ranging between three to five acres, would
have daily truckloads taking the fresh produce

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.599
straight to one of these wayside markets.

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:36.160
But this wasn't just a pit stop for a few
vegetables for motorists.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.440
Davidson wanted something altogether more
substantial, which would form a destination.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.480
You know there was a crèche and a beauty
parlor.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:54.349
There were three different types of eateries,
as well as the delicatessen, the popcorn and

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:05.760
peanut butter units, and masses of fresh flowers
and produce, which from the outside made this

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.710
ziggurat form like a temple of fresh produce.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.030
So really making it a community center in

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:22.139
this idea of a kind of dispersed way of inhabiting
the rural landscape.

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:32.029
The farm was central to Frank Lloyd Wright's
broad-ranging vision for the new ecological

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:33.520
and urban landscape.
