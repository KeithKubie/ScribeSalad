00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.057
- [Voiceover] Over the past two years,

00:00:03.057 --> 00:00:07.140
apparel manufacturers
have worked to meeting

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.522
the revised federal standards

00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:12.020
for the design of uniforms.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.585
Then we have the option of no error.

00:00:13.585 --> 00:00:14.420
So, let me...

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.785
That felt a little weird
the first time I read it.

00:00:15.785 --> 00:00:18.322
Let me see if I can
pinpoint what felt off.

00:00:18.322 --> 00:00:20.252
Over the past two years,

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:23.988
apparel manufacturers have worked

00:00:23.988 --> 00:00:26.420
to meeting.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.333
What we're talking...

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:28.333
Who's doing the action?

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.723
We're talking about apparel manufacturers

00:00:30.723 --> 00:00:34.722
So apparel manufacturers
would work to meet.

00:00:34.722 --> 00:00:37.053
Would work to meet

00:00:37.053 --> 00:00:39.150
the revised federal standards

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.550
for the design of uniforms.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.680
So, the error here is C.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.795
Apparel manufacturers, this is plural.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:47.980
What do they do? They would meet.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.793
They would work to meeting

00:00:50.793 --> 00:00:53.620
the revised federal standards.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.290
So, yes, definitely
error right here, at C.
