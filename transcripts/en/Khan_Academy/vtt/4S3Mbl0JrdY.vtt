00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:01.915
- [Voiceover] We're told that Burger Barn

00:00:01.915 --> 00:00:05.734
makes dipping sauce by
mixing two spoonfuls of honey

00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:09.313
with one half spoonful of mustard.

00:00:09.313 --> 00:00:11.108
Sandwich Town makes dipping sauce

00:00:11.108 --> 00:00:13.164
by mixing four spoonfuls of honey

00:00:13.164 --> 00:00:16.373
with one spoonful of mustard.

00:00:16.373 --> 00:00:21.362
Which dipping sauce has a
stronger mustard flavor?

00:00:21.362 --> 00:00:22.945
So pause this video and see if you can

00:00:22.945 --> 00:00:25.108
work through that on your own.

00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:26.772
All right, now let's
think about the ratios

00:00:26.772 --> 00:00:30.831
of honey to mustard at
each of these restaurants.

00:00:30.831 --> 00:00:34.159
So first let's think about
the scenario with Burger Barn.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:37.658
So I'll just say BB for
short, for Burger Burn.

00:00:37.658 --> 00:00:39.974
So they have two spoonfuls of honey

00:00:39.974 --> 00:00:42.376
for every one half spoonful of mustard,

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:44.793
so the ratio of honey to mustard

00:00:44.793 --> 00:00:48.710
in terms of spoonfuls is
two spoonfuls of honey

00:00:50.121 --> 00:00:53.371
for every one half spoonful of mustard,

00:00:55.298 --> 00:00:58.618
so this is the ratio of honey to mustard.

00:00:58.618 --> 00:00:59.679
Let me write this.

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:04.672
This is honey, and this
right over here is mustard.

00:01:04.672 --> 00:01:08.839
Now, let's look at Sandwich
Town, so I'll call that ST.

00:01:10.626 --> 00:01:12.083
So Sandwich Town makes dipping sauce

00:01:12.083 --> 00:01:14.552
by having four spoonfuls of honey

00:01:14.552 --> 00:01:16.894
for every one spoonful of mustard.

00:01:16.894 --> 00:01:18.996
So the ratio of honey to mustard

00:01:18.996 --> 00:01:22.599
is four spoonfuls to one spoonful,

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:26.682
so once again, that is
honey and that is mustard.

00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:31.870
Now, can we make these equivalent ratios

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.577
or can we compare them somehow?

00:01:33.577 --> 00:01:35.081
Well, let's see.

00:01:35.081 --> 00:01:37.852
We have one half spoonful of mustard here.

00:01:37.852 --> 00:01:39.602
We have one spoon of mustard here,

00:01:39.602 --> 00:01:41.342
so what if we multiplied both the mustard

00:01:41.342 --> 00:01:44.380
and the honey spoonfuls by two?

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.669
That still would be an equivalent ratio

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:48.053
because we're multiplying
by the same amount.

00:01:48.053 --> 00:01:51.934
So if we multiply by
two in both situations,

00:01:51.934 --> 00:01:54.571
you have four spoonfuls of honey

00:01:54.571 --> 00:01:57.404
for every one spoonful of mustard.

00:01:59.044 --> 00:02:00.460
Well, that's the exact same ratio

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.157
that we have at Sandwich Town.

00:02:02.157 --> 00:02:04.465
So it actually turns out that they have

00:02:04.465 --> 00:02:07.960
the same concentration of mustard.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.929
They have the same ratio
of honey to mustard.

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:15.174
Four spoonfuls of honey for
every spoonful of mustard

00:02:15.174 --> 00:02:17.434
in either situation.

00:02:17.434 --> 00:02:18.820
Let's do another example.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.987
So here, we are asked or
we are told, we are told,

00:02:25.817 --> 00:02:28.674
Patrick's favorite shade of purple paint

00:02:28.674 --> 00:02:31.343
is made with four ounces of blue paint,

00:02:31.343 --> 00:02:35.510
so underline that in blue,
four ounces of blue paint,

00:02:36.784 --> 00:02:39.312
for every three ounces of red paint,

00:02:39.312 --> 00:02:41.610
for every three ounces of red paint.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.280
So the ratio of blue paint to red paint

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.947
is four ounces of blue,
four ounces of blue,

00:02:50.063 --> 00:02:54.063
for every three ounces
of red, so four to three.

00:02:55.197 --> 00:02:56.825
Which of the following paint mixtures

00:02:56.825 --> 00:03:00.223
will create the same shade of purple?

00:03:00.223 --> 00:03:01.623
All right, pause this video

00:03:01.623 --> 00:03:04.826
and see if you can figure
it out on your own.

00:03:04.826 --> 00:03:06.559
So this is three ounces of blue paint

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:08.702
mixed with four ounces of red paint.

00:03:08.702 --> 00:03:12.369
Well, this is a ratio
here of three to four,

00:03:14.804 --> 00:03:16.739
and even though it's dealing
with the same numbers,

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.023
this is a different ratio.

00:03:18.023 --> 00:03:19.238
The order matters.

00:03:19.238 --> 00:03:22.318
This is four ounces of blue
for every three ounces of red.

00:03:22.318 --> 00:03:24.489
This is saying three ounces of blue

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.110
for every four ounces of red,
so we could rule this one out.

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.890
Eight ounces of blue paint mixed

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.372
with six ounces of red paint.

00:03:32.372 --> 00:03:35.672
So here, this ratio is
eight ounces of blue

00:03:35.672 --> 00:03:38.005
for every six ounces of red.

00:03:40.133 --> 00:03:42.252
Well, are these equivalent ratios?

00:03:42.252 --> 00:03:45.153
Well, the difference, or you can go,

00:03:45.153 --> 00:03:48.320
if you multiply by two in either case,

00:03:49.527 --> 00:03:52.056
you will get to eight to six.

00:03:52.056 --> 00:03:55.677
Four times two is eight,
three times two is six.

00:03:55.677 --> 00:03:57.917
So this is indeed an equivalent ratio,

00:03:57.917 --> 00:03:59.971
so we would select this one.

00:03:59.971 --> 00:04:02.173
All right, here they say
six ounces of blue paint

00:04:02.173 --> 00:04:04.906
mixed with eight ounces of red paint.

00:04:04.906 --> 00:04:08.221
So this is, they've swapped
the blues and the red

00:04:08.221 --> 00:04:11.293
relative to this one, so this
is a ratio of six to eight,

00:04:11.293 --> 00:04:13.238
so let me write this down.

00:04:13.238 --> 00:04:15.439
So this is a ratio, six
ounces of blue paint

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.409
for every eight ounces of red paint.

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:20.064
So just like we ruled out that first one,

00:04:20.064 --> 00:04:22.001
this is dealing with the same numbers

00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:23.935
but in a different order
and the order matters,

00:04:23.935 --> 00:04:25.374
so we'll rule that out.

00:04:25.374 --> 00:04:29.783
20 ounces of blue paint,
20 ounces of blue paint,

00:04:29.783 --> 00:04:33.176
for every 15 ounces of red paint.

00:04:33.176 --> 00:04:35.381
So are these equivalent?

00:04:35.381 --> 00:04:37.319
Well, let's think about it.

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:41.555
To go from four to 20,
you can multiply by five,

00:04:41.555 --> 00:04:44.546
and to go from three to 15,
you could multiply by five,

00:04:44.546 --> 00:04:45.999
so we can multiply by the same factor

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:48.738
to go from four to three to 20 to 15,

00:04:48.738 --> 00:04:51.905
so this is indeed an equivalent ratio.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.649
12 ounces of blue paint mixed
with 16 ounces of red paint.

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:59.368
All right, so this is a ratio here

00:04:59.368 --> 00:05:03.368
of 12 ounces of blue for
every 16 ounces of red.

00:05:04.302 --> 00:05:06.728
So let's think about this.

00:05:06.728 --> 00:05:10.895
To go from four to 12, you
would multiply by three.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.255
Now, if you multiplied three by three,

00:05:16.255 --> 00:05:18.547
you would have a nine here, not a 16,

00:05:18.547 --> 00:05:20.732
so this is definitely
not an equivalent ratio.

00:05:20.732 --> 00:05:21.805
Another way of thinking about it,

00:05:21.805 --> 00:05:23.851
you have, in terms of ounces,

00:05:23.851 --> 00:05:26.275
you have more ounces of
blue than you have of red

00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:27.827
for any of the equivalent ratios,

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:30.088
but here you have more
ounces of red than blue,

00:05:30.088 --> 00:05:32.005
so once again, another way of realizing

00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:33.440
that that is not equivalent,

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.740
so only B and D are
the equivalent mixtures

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.840
that will provide the
same shade of purple.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.875
To have that same shade,

00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:44.441
you need the same ratio of blue to red.
