MALE SPEAKER: Ladies and
gentleman, Dan Kaufman,

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.850
Director of Google ATAP.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:05.702
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.702 --> 00:00:06.410
DAN KAUFMAN: Hey.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.590
Thank you.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.620
Good morning, everybody.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.300
I am Dan Kaufman.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.590
One year ago,
almost to this day,

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.060
Google asked me to come
and help lead ATAP.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.860
And I remember sitting
in my hotel room,

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.540
watching the ATAP
I/O presentation,

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.690
and I was just
fascinated with this idea

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.340
that we could bridge the gap
between our physical world

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.200
and our digital lives.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.410
And I was moved
by this insistence

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.980
that we remember our humanity,
that we take our human nature

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.210
and bet it in technology.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.580
And I could not
wait to come here.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.830
And now it's one year later,
and I'm the head of ATAP,

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.760
and I get to share
with all of you

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.230
some of the stuff we've been
working on over the last year.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.386
And I could not be more excited.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.010
We have a completely
packed show today.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.720
We're going to be like,
right up to the edge,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.830
and so I'm just going to give
you a very brief overview

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:59.913
of what we're going to do.

00:00:59.913 --> 00:01:01.550
And then we're just
going to get to it.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.739
So one thing I get asked a
lot, when I go out around

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.440
and I talk about ATAP, is
what does success mean.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.565
How do you measure success.

00:01:08.565 --> 00:01:09.981
How do you know
you're successful.

00:01:09.981 --> 00:01:10.870
What becomes success.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.597
So we'll talk a
little bit about that.

00:01:12.597 --> 00:01:14.180
Then we're going to
get you caught up,

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.600
and give you an update on
projects Jacquard and Soli,

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.939
two projects we showed
extremely early.

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:19.480
AUDIENCE: Woo

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.396
DAN KAUFMAN: Yes, woo!

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.430
We showed you some really
early prototypes of that.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.520
And we're going to show you how
it's made its journey, as we

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.103
worked with some of
you, as developers

00:01:29.103 --> 00:01:32.432
and some commercial partners on
its way to becoming a product.

00:01:32.432 --> 00:01:34.890
And then of course, we got to
talk about Aura, who does not

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.240
want to talk about
Aura, everybody

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.990
wants to talk about Aura.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.489
Yes?

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:40.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.519
So we got an update for you.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:45.060
And then finally, as has been
our tradition over the last two

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.500
years, we're going to end
with a new spotlight story.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.970
Except this year, we've
got a really special twist.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.422
And I hope you like it.

00:01:52.422 --> 00:01:53.380
And I hope you like it.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.190
So let's first
talk about success,

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.080
and what success means to us.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.020
In order for me to
tell you what success

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.010
means for a project in ATAP,
I have to take you back

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.650
to the beginning.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.380
Everything in ATAP starts
with a person, and a passion,

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.889
and an idea.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:13.170
And that idea is often
a little bit crazy.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.560
It sort of borders right on that
line between what's possible,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.190
and what's impossible.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.230
And so the first thing we do
is, we do a deep scientific dive

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.480
to try to find out and make
sure that it still-- it

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.400
really lives within the
realm of what's possible.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.330
And if we conclude that
it does, then we dig in

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.000
and we work on it usually
for a year, sometimes more.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.620
And it's hard, it's really hard.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.890
And it's hard because there's
no precedence for what we do.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.270
There's just nothing out
there like that before.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.620
And so we have to invent things.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.620
We have to invent new materials.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.870
We have to invent
new testing rigs.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.520
We have to invent new
software concepts.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.850
And we often hit roadblocks,
and we stumble, and we fall.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.610
And we get back up again,
and we fight, and we persist.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.660
And we do it because
it's important,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.560
and because we
believe in this idea.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.730
And then something
magical happens,

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.270
we see this little glimmer of
light at the end of the tunnel.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.900
And we think, holy cow this
thing that was just an idea

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.130
may be real.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.750
And we go to the lab, and
it's there, and it exists.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.540
And at that moment, we turn to
developers, such as yourselves,

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.880
and commercial partners, and
we ask one simple question.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.280
If we can make this thing
exist, not just in a lab,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.860
but in the real world,
what would you do with it.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.030
What could you build,
what products could it be,

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.160
how could we impact
people's lives.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.600
How do we get things
into the hands of people.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.530
But most importantly, we
ask them a simple question.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.150
Do you want to come on
this journey with us?

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.880
And when they say yes,
things begin to change.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.494
They inject all
sorts of new energy,

00:03:53.494 --> 00:03:54.910
they have all sorts
of ideas, they

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.880
want to take our technology
places we never imagined.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.587
We encounter all
sorts of new problems

00:03:59.587 --> 00:04:00.920
that we never thought of before.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.336
And more importantly,
they come up

00:04:02.336 --> 00:04:05.190
with solutions to these
problems that blow our minds.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.400
And all of a sudden
these fledgling ideas

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.750
start to become prototypes.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.980
And prototypes become products.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.570
So success for us is when our
projects make this transition.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.660
Because after all
for things to matter,

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.180
people have to be
able to use them.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.630
Now these transitions happen
in many different ways.

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.020
I'm going to give you
three brief examples,

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.394
we've had a whole
bunch of these.

00:04:26.394 --> 00:04:28.020
But three may give you a feel.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.870
So about two years
on the I/O stage,

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.430
Johnny Lee wondered, if we
could map the indoor world

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.920
the same way Google can
map the outside world,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.160
and he showed a
couple of prototypes.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.980
Well now with the help of
Clay Bavor and the VR team,

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.460
they took Tango from
these early prototypes,

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.450
that we shared at
I/O to a product

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.800
you'll be able to buy later
this year from Lenovo.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.392
Yeah, go buy one.

00:04:51.392 --> 00:04:55.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.380
MALE SPEAKER: Last year, we
talked about Project Abacus.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.130
This was Deepak
Chandra's vision,

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.625
to get rid of passwords and
all of the annoying things

00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:05.250
that we wanted.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.360
And he thought, gee,
look we have a phone,

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.360
and these phones have all
these sensors in them.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.280
Why couldn't it just
know who I was, so I

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.559
don't need a password, I
should just be able to work.

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:15.600
Well, thanks to our friends
at Search and Machine

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.710
Intelligence, they've
taken these ideas,

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.049
and they've turned
it into a trust API.

00:05:20.049 --> 00:05:21.590
And what we're going
to do with this,

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:23.350
is be able to get rid
of the awkwardness

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.030
of second-factor authentication.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.150
This June, we're going
out to several very large

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.290
financial institutions
for initial testing.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.710
And assuming it goes
well, this should

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:33.390
become available
to every Android

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.780
developer around the world
by the end of the year.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.207
I cannot wait to see what
you guys build with it.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.570
Now, sometimes this
transition-- you know,

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.120
transitions don't happen
on a schedule, right.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.500
Sometimes they just pop
up and surprise you,

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.720
and so I wanted to
share this one with you,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.479
because nobody's ever seen
it outside of our shop.

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.270
A while ago, we were
looking at this slide.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:58.730
And this is a very complex
slide, so don't worry about it.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.370
Here's the bottom line.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.800
There is an epidemic in
congestive heart failure,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.080
and it costs us millions of
lives and billions of dollars.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.400
And what we do today to
help people with that,

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.750
is we do surgery,
and we use what

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.900
we call an invasive sensor.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.270
So you do surgery, and you
put a sensor in the chest,

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.130
and then it helps
monitor people's health.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.530
And we saw this as a problem.

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.320
And we wondered, if I could
replace these invasive sensors

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.500
with noninvasive sensors,
wouldn't that be amazing.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.210
All of a sudden, the cost
of health care would drop.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.870
We could give this to everybody.

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:31.970
You wouldn't need
surgery, which is risky.

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.900
And we shared that
vision with Andy Conrad,

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.870
and Jessica Mega, who were at
the time, all part of Google

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.910
Life Sciences, now Verily.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.190
And they love that vision.

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:44.260
And so we've transitioned our
people, and our technology,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.280
and the IP, because
we want to get this

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.615
developed as fast as possible.

00:06:47.615 --> 00:06:48.990
And we could not
think of anybody

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:50.156
who's better off to do that.

00:06:50.156 --> 00:06:52.900
So hopefully, you will get
this in everybody's hands

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.960
as soon as possible.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.190
So for us, that's what
success looks like.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.980
Because after all, ideas
are most meaningful

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.120
when put into practice.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.150
So today, that's what
I want to focus on.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.330
I want to focus on this
journey that we take you on.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.010
From an early idea, to
a prototype, to just

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:15.380
the beginning glimmers of
a commercial application.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:17.230
So let's get started.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.210
Last year, Dr. Ivan
Poupyrev introduced us

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.340
to two projects, project
Soli and project Jacquard.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.320
And over the past
year, Ivan and his team

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.070
have been working with
commercial partners

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.220
and developers, and to
give you an idea of where

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.670
we are on that journey, and for
an update, Dr. Ivan Poupyrev.

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:39.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:41.090
IVAN POUPYREV: Thank you, Dan.

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:43.810
Good morning.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:48.410
So let's talk about project
Soli and project Jacquard.

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:52.260
In project Jacquard that
was announced last year,

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:54.950
we develop a new interactive
Textile Technology

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:57.100
to create connected clothes.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:01.595
We also announced
partnership with Levis.

00:08:01.595 --> 00:08:03.053
And there is a lot
of speculation--

00:08:03.053 --> 00:08:03.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.050
DAN KAUFMAN: There we go.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.100
And there is a lot of
speculation, what are

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.770
they going to make with them.

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.930
So let's look at one of them.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.190
MALE SPEAKER: Apparently,
Google is developing

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.930
a new digital type of
fabric that you can touch,

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:19.990
and it can feel it.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:22.240
And it also Bluetooth's
to your phone.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.360
So now you can swipe the side of
your jeans to mute your phone.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.310
Even tap the fabric for
playing any song, which

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:31.200
means pretty soon all your
calls can be butt dials.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:34.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.880
IVAN POUPYREV: Butt
dials, seriously.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.159
That's a million
dollar idea for you.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:45.180
Almost accurate, except
we're not making smart pants.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.950
No folks, no smart pants.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:50.090
Instead, the very
first Jacquard garment

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:54.790
is going to be Levi's
commuter trucker jacket,

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:56.687
fashionable and functional.

00:08:56.687 --> 00:09:02.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.080
Fashionable and
functional garment

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.140
to wear on and off the bike.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.420
And to tell you why commuter
jacket is a perfect fit

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.010
for Jacquard, I would
like to invite on stage,

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:14.907
Paul Dillinger, VP of
Innovation from Levi's.

00:09:14.907 --> 00:09:15.490
Welcome, Paul.

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:16.573
PAUL DILLINGER: Thank you.

00:09:16.573 --> 00:09:18.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:19.945
Thank you.

00:09:19.945 --> 00:09:21.570
Thanks very much for
that introduction.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.028
But we actually
already met, right.

00:09:23.028 --> 00:09:26.880
It's hard to believe it was just
a year ago at Google I/O '15,

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:28.550
when we were first introduced.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.750
It's also hard to believe
it's been 143 years,

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:33.260
since Levi Strauss first
invented the blue jean.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.610
That's today, May 20th, is
the actual official birthday

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:37.390
of the blue jean.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.700
Thank you.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.474
So for 143 years
at Levi's, we've

00:09:43.474 --> 00:09:44.890
been making clothing
with purpose.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.050
It started in the 1800s,
making durable clothing

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.270
for the miners who had
come out for the gold rush.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.380
Fast forward to 2011, we first
introduced our Levi's commuter

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.200
collection.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.290
It's a purposeful design.

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.440
Clothing built for the-- to meet
the needs of the urban cyclist.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.190
But the formula has
always been simple,

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:01.879
make a quality clothes that
perform as great as they look.

00:10:01.879 --> 00:10:04.170
And so it's in that context,
I'm excited to talk to you

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.910
about today's newest addition
to the commuter family,

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.550
which is the trucker jacket
powered by Google's Jacquard

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.350
technology.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.760
Anyone who rides a bike,
knows that tension.

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.650
How do you go on a ride
without going off grid.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.650
Anyone who owns a bike--
anyone who rides a bike

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.499
knows that it's a
terrible idea to try

00:10:21.499 --> 00:10:23.040
to navigate the
screen of your phone,

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.790
while you're navigating
busy city streets.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:28.460
But this technology gives us a
first time real world solution

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.860
to that real world problem.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.520
Now if you imagine the
opportunity for a woven tactile

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.380
interface in the context of the
most explicit and urgent needs

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.200
of an urban cyclist, that's
safety and awareness.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.610
The opportunity becomes really
real and really valuable.

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:45.620
This becomes a copilot for
your ride and for your life,

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.670
both on and off the bike.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.450
This is a good friend
helping you out.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.837
So now, to access the
most necessary pieces

00:10:50.837 --> 00:10:52.420
of your digital life,
you simply touch

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:55.100
the sleeve of your jacket.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.580
This is a customized
kind of activity.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:00.362
This is maximized awareness
and minimized distraction.

00:11:00.362 --> 00:11:01.820
And all of this
without sacrificing

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.100
the style of a great looking
Levis trucker jacket.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.755
So now, if you want
to answer a phone call

00:11:07.755 --> 00:11:10.130
or block a phone call, if you
want to control your music,

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.580
if you want to
drop a pin to make

00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:14.212
your personal map
of the city, if you

00:11:14.212 --> 00:11:16.670
want to access your navigation
so you can get lost and then

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:18.545
get found-- all of that
can be done with just

00:11:18.545 --> 00:11:20.770
a gesture, a tap, a swipe.

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:22.770
Now you might think that
this kind of technology

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.230
would be precious.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:26.810
But we're not making
Levis trucker gadgets,

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.610
we're making trucker
jackets, jean jackets,

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:29.850
this is a tough technology.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.266
At the end of the day, you can
just wad it up and throw it

00:11:32.266 --> 00:11:33.020
in your backpack.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.353
You don't have to hang it up,
just drop it on the floor.

00:11:35.353 --> 00:11:38.530
If you get this thing dirty, you
put it in the washing machine.

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.660
This is friendly,
easy going technology.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.260
This is technology you can wash.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.300
But enough out of me.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.420
I think we should take a look
at this jacket in action.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.310
So let's watch a video.

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.030
I'm going to throw one on and
come back and talk you guys

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:51.321
about some of the features, OK.

00:11:51.321 --> 00:11:55.464
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:55.464 --> 00:12:42.680
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:47.517
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:47.517 --> 00:12:49.600
IVAN POUPYREV: So Paul
going to come back and show

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.660
the jacket in a second.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.020
And before that, let's
take a deeper look

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.940
at what Google Jacquard is.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.790
Google Jacquard is a platform.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.610
It's not just another
wearable, it's

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:01.250
a platform to create
smart connected clothes.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:03.880
It consists of the garment,
with a woven gesture

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.360
sensor somewhere in the cuff.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.590
A piece of electronics,
or Jacquard tag,

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:13.180
which connects your
jacket to the LED,

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.200
haptics, IMU sensor, and
also the batteries to power

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:16.930
the jacket.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:21.990
It uses custom connection
in the cuff to do that.

00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:24.260
The Jacquard can be
charged from any use cable.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.740
So in his computer, so you don't
need a cable with the jacket.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.830
We also have a Jacquard
app on the phone,

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:35.091
which connects your jacket
to services in the cloud.

00:13:35.091 --> 00:13:37.340
There is a unique challenge
in creating smart clothing

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:37.839
platform.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.960
Fashion technology
has to work as one,

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.200
but there is inherent
tension between the two.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.680
For example, when we designed
our jacket for the first time,

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.270
we were compromising
garment and aesthetics.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:53.770
The first design
of interactive area

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.250
was like this, straight line.

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:56.950
We are engineers, we
like things simple.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.210
Everything is
visible, everything

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.550
is easy to understand.

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.910
However, this is not denim.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:07.070
It was not authentic,
and it didn't look good.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.760
So then we did-- went the
other way around and removed it

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.690
completely, made it
completely invisible.

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.190
But now you cannot
interact with that.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.910
So we were working with our
craftsmen in Japan and Levis,

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.760
and designed a new
look, new denim

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.780
weaving techniques,
which blended

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.440
gesture sensing to fabric.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.660
Made it both visible
and invisible,

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:27.820
while preserving an
authentic denim look.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.770
In fashion, fit matters.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:35.540
You have to design technology,
which fits jackets of any size,

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.750
from extra small to extra large.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:41.220
You probably don't have
a technology world.

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.210
That's why our Jacquard
tag is feeling flexible,

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.630
so you can bend around
the cuff of any size,

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:49.130
and fit the jacket of any size.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.610
The design was inspired by
the design of a classic trench

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:52.200
coat.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.740
And though it looks
simple, it was a long road

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:55.995
to make it just right.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.320
It has to be robust.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.320
Technology is fragile.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.800
Garments, as Paul mentioned
are not, very durable.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.000
Now, these days you don't have
to pull them with two horses

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.730
to prove that it really works.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.160
Those days are behind us.

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.530
But we have to be able to
wash it, at the very least.

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:23.160
In our first test,
our yarns would

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.280
break after one or two washes.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.650
So we went on and worked
hard to understand

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:31.690
the reason of failure,
we'd analyze our yarns

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:32.740
at the microscope.

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:35.350
And then prove them
to the point where

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.020
we exceeded the
Levi's requirements

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.700
for jacket durability.

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:42.310
We don't have to treat
Jacquard jacket any differently

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.790
from regular jacket.

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:49.420
Finally, clothes are
made by apparel makers,

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:51.510
not by consumer
electronics makers.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:55.270
It's our vision that any
apparel maker, not only Levis,

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:58.530
should be able to manufacture
their own smart garments using

00:15:58.530 --> 00:15:59.780
Jacquard.

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.040
Using their own supply
chain, because we

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:04.810
want to empower the
apparel industry to create

00:16:04.810 --> 00:16:07.510
this new product platform.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:09.510
So we work with Levis,
we setup production

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.940
in the same facilities,
in the same location

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.350
as the regular mass production.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:16.640
We use the same denim
looms, and exactly the same

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.820
processes to weave
our interactive denim.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.620
There was no exception.

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:25.150
When you make denim, you
burn excessive fibers

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:26.189
with open flames.

00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:28.480
Our interactive technology
went through the same thing.

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:35.990
Finally, then it was shipped
in the same assembly factory,

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:39.470
the same treatments, the
same construction techniques

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.420
as a regular denim jacket.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:46.429
Industrial washing, every
garment goes through that.

00:16:46.429 --> 00:16:48.220
Of course, we added
some testing facilities

00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.960
to understand quality control,
see it works at the exit.

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:54.960
But at the end, it's
a regular jacket.

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.890
It feels good and
makes you look great.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:10.859
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:10.859 --> 00:17:15.400
I guess I want to say is that,
Jacquard jackets is foremost,

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:16.730
a jacket.

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.530
It protects you from wind
and rain, keeps you warm,

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.060
and makes you look great.

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.230
But much more than a jacket.

00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:25.520
As a user of the
jacket, you will

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.710
be able to configure it to
connect your favorite services,

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:32.295
such as control calls and
messages from the phone,

00:17:32.295 --> 00:17:34.670
or use your favorite Google
services, Google Maps, Google

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:36.050
Play, or others.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.330
You can use third-party services
such as Spotify and Strava

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:41.230
and we are already
working with third parties

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:43.650
to include their
support to the jacket.

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:47.060
And finally, it can be custom
services developed by you,

00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:47.920
by developers.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.520
And we will be releasing
APIs to allow you to do that.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.670
Furthermore, we are trying to
expand to go beyond biking,

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:58.280
and going to work
with athletics,

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.020
business wear, and enterprise.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.770
But first things first.

00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:06.430
Our jacket is going
to be released

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:09.126
on the market in Spring 2017.

00:18:09.126 --> 00:18:13.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:16.540
Now, you don't have
to wait that long.

00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.930
And you can help us to
improve the product by joining

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:24.780
the beta in Fall 2016.

00:18:24.780 --> 00:18:27.300
And now let's take a
look at the jacket.

00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:32.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:35.650
PAUL DILLINGER: I'll
set this right here.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:36.920
There we go.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.056
So it's a Jean jacket, right.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.895
It's had some great
formal modifications,

00:18:44.895 --> 00:18:46.270
the forms have
been adapted to be

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:47.620
most useful for the cyclists.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.390
For example, little
things like the backs

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:50.681
a little longer than the front.

00:18:50.681 --> 00:18:52.470
So you don't have
that unfortunate gap

00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:53.930
when you're in your bike stance.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:57.080
It's also got a full flex
extension in the back,

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.750
so you've got maximum
range of motion.

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:01.140
And localized venting to
keep you cool and comfortable

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.420
on your ride.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:05.111
It's got a neat storm cuff right
here, so that it holds close

00:19:05.111 --> 00:19:07.610
against your wrist, and doesn't
let wind come up your sleeve

00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:08.651
when you're on your bike.

00:19:08.651 --> 00:19:12.270
But the real magic happens
over here, on this sleeve.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:13.614
So

00:19:13.614 --> 00:19:15.114
IVAN POUPYREV: Yeah,
as you can see.

00:19:15.114 --> 00:19:17.474
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:17.474 --> 00:19:19.140
PAUL DILLINGER:
You can see, fully

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.610
responsive to the touch of
the wearer against the--

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:23.129
it's just the fabric.

00:19:23.129 --> 00:19:25.170
So there's a bunch of
different things it can do,

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.485
so Ivan, let's pick a
few that this will--

00:19:27.485 --> 00:19:28.600
IVAN POUPYREV: Yeah,
so this is a kind of,

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.460
this is an application, which
is installed in the jacket

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:31.410
right now.

00:19:31.410 --> 00:19:33.350
It's good for the
[INAUDIBLE] burn counter.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:34.600
PAUL DILLINGER: No, thank you.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.104
I don't need the
burn counter today.

00:19:36.104 --> 00:19:38.020
IVAN POUPYREV: So we
have music-- we installed

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.103
music and compass for you.

00:19:39.103 --> 00:19:40.240
So you can control this.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.660
Music and compass are
pretty much all I need.

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:43.201
I love to listen to
music on my bike.

00:19:43.201 --> 00:19:45.410
I don't listen to this
song hardly on my--

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:47.510
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:48.330
There we go.

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.127
That's my bike jam, OK.

00:19:50.127 --> 00:19:53.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:55.610
Now, my next meeting
after this is going

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:57.239
to be over at Levi stadium.

00:19:57.239 --> 00:19:58.780
I know how to get
there, but I'd just

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:00.130
like to know how long
it's going to take me.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:01.421
IVAN POUPYREV: Yeah, good idea.

00:20:01.421 --> 00:20:02.820
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:04.885
FEMALE SPEAKER: Your
ETA is 41 minutes,

00:20:04.885 --> 00:20:06.957
you should arrive by 11:01 am.

00:20:06.957 --> 00:20:08.040
PAUL DILLINGER: All right,

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:08.810
IVAN POUPYREV: You've got to go.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:09.960
PAUL DILLINGER: OK, I got to go.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.040
If I'm going to
make that ride, I

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:11.790
got to get out of
here, all right.

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.164
IVAN POUPYREV:
Thank you so much.

00:20:13.164 --> 00:20:26.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.400
So with Jacquard, we
created new materials

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.380
that allow us to use
embedded interactions

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:34.120
in everyday objects,
such as clothing.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:36.010
In our next project,
project Soli.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:39.610
We explore how can we use
a small set of fine finger

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:43.670
gestures to control
everything around us.

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:48.720
In technical terms, Soli can be
described as a small tiny pica

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.210
radar for gesture sensing.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.780
It's a radar, and we
created new radar sensors,

00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:00.812
running at 60 GHz, that can
track hand gestures using novel

00:21:00.812 --> 00:21:02.020
algorithms that we developed.

00:21:07.550 --> 00:21:09.180
The algorithm,
extremely fine-- allows

00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.638
to track really fine gestures,
such as rubbing your fingers

00:21:11.638 --> 00:21:14.330
against each other, which
allows us to create completely

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:18.050
new gesture languages
and gesture interfaces.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:20.530
So we develop a vision where
your hand is the only control

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:21.230
that you need.

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:25.390
One movement is a virtual
dial or slider or button.

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.440
And these are just
virtual controls.

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.690
You should be able to
control any device around you

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.480
with the same set of
gestures-- wearables, speakers,

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.610
or any other objects,
internet of the things world.

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.040
We showed this
recently last year

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.670
at Google I/O. And showed
the proof of concept.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:48.090
And the potential of Soli
captured people's imagination.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:51.360
It feels very futuristic,
almost science fiction.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.167
So this year, after
last Google I/O,

00:21:53.167 --> 00:21:55.240
we focus on bringing
the science fiction

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:59.510
vision into the reality, to
developers, into products.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:02.570
That was our goal.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:06.010
Our first step was really the
Soli Development Kit, which

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:08.310
we did in October last year.

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:09.990
And the kit included
everything that you

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:13.830
need to develop your
products or projects--

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.180
hardware, software
libraries, documentations,

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:18.200
everything you need.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:21.320
It was early work, so we
selected about 60 developers,

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:25.639
from 180 applications, coming
from 14 foreign countries.

00:22:25.639 --> 00:22:28.180
And we were quite encouraged by
the diversity of the projects

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.330
people built using our sensors.

00:22:30.330 --> 00:22:34.030
In this example, people using
Soli to recognize materials,

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:37.080
such as copper or milk or water.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:40.820
People use it for 3D imaging.

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:44.030
People drawing in
touch interaction,

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:49.310
in-car remote
control, the control

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:53.470
to lock your things, security
and password with gestures,

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.380
navigate visualizations,
and compose and play music.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:03.128
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:23:03.128 --> 00:23:08.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:11.220
So this selection-- very
first selection, very first

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.110
few projects developed
by developers

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:14.810
using our Soli sensor.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:18.260
And developing launching
Soli for all of alpha dev kit

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.030
was an important milestone.

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:22.370
It was the first of its
kind, the first radar

00:23:22.370 --> 00:23:26.680
you can play in your own
workshop or research lab.

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.320
However, it was
just a first step.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.470
What we showed last
year, was designed

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:34.000
to run in controlled
environment, in a research lab,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.120
in a workshop.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.510
It can allow it to relate
possibilities of the radar

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:41.860
for interaction, but you cannot
really build products with it.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.830
For example, it was
using so much power

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.290
that our legal
department asked me

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:48.873
to put this label on the back
of the-- of the development kit.

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.070
Although the Soli
chip is very small,

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:56.520
they still require a
large computer to run it.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.645
And so it kind of defeats
the purpose-- small chip,

00:23:58.645 --> 00:24:00.070
giant computer.

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:02.800
So to prove that Soli is not
just a futuristic concept,

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.680
it can work outside of the lab.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.800
We decided that by
this Google I/O, not

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.320
only are we going
to improve it, we're

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.017
going to make it run
it on a smartwatch.

00:24:14.017 --> 00:24:18.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:20.620
So the way I think
about it, if you

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.370
can make something
run on smartwatch,

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.940
you can make it run
any way you want.

00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.550
So setting this kind
of goal, what it does,

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.440
it creates such an
impulse to the team,

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.390
that the progress is
exponential, not incremental.

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:35.290
For example, we had to
drastically decrease the size

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:38.210
and power of the entire system.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.280
By working with our
partners at Infinium,

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.450
we completely redesign
the Soli chip.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:45.550
We optimized [INAUDIBLE] control
algorithms overall system

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:49.340
architecture, and reduce
power consumption 22 times,

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:53.372
from 1.2 Watt to 54 milliWatt.

00:24:53.372 --> 00:24:57.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.510
And this is just a first
step in our optimization.

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:03.070
We also reduced
footprint three times.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.820
Now reducing power
is not sufficient.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.410
As I mentioned, there's a
giant computer around the Soli.

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:10.070
So we also had to
optimize computization.

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:13.860
Now radars are naturally very
computizationally expensive,

00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:17.030
often require a supercomputer
for the imaging and tracking,

00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.860
when tracking satellites or
planes or something like that.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:24.110
Now we don't have supercomputer,
this is our embedded platform,

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:27.480
it uses the same
processors as a watch.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.290
So by optimizing our
signal processing

00:25:29.290 --> 00:25:31.750
pipeline, and
algorithms, we were

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:37.330
able to achieve 256x reduction
in the code performance,

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:40.450
while maintaining 80,000
frames per second throughput

00:25:40.450 --> 00:25:43.240
of the radar.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:49.290
So you don't have to compromise
your performance for small form

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:50.636
factor.

00:25:50.636 --> 00:25:52.510
And by the way, it's
all run through Android.

00:25:52.510 --> 00:25:59.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:02.100
However, nothing is
free in this world.

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:03.210
And there are trade-offs.

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:04.970
And I want to talk
about one of them.

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:07.570
With every hardware reduction,
with every improvement

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:11.120
of our algorithms, we
changed the radar signal,

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.120
and this is something,
which is called glitches,

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.370
a collection of signal
artifacts that we discover

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:17.620
and have to find a work around.

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:20.000
Some of them are well-known
research literature,

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.270
such as IQ channel
imbalance, Doppler

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:24.130
mirror images, ghost targets.

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:27.130
But a lot of this ghost--
a lot of those glitches

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:30.100
are new, and the result of
our aggressive reduction

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.370
of the hardware and software.

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:35.450
So this is ongoing research
and development work.

00:26:35.450 --> 00:26:38.750
Now this-- I can talk more about
the challenges and problems.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:40.130
But let's get to the watch.

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:41.590
Let's show the watch.

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:43.140
This is the first
watch we developed.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.014
It doesn't look like a watch.

00:26:49.014 --> 00:26:51.180
Working with our partners
in LG electronics company,

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.420
from LG Electronics
Research team,

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.350
we actually built the first
watch and it put like that.

00:26:56.350 --> 00:27:00.420
At this time, this time radar
was embedded into the band--

00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:03.060
into the belt of the watch.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.330
We see it in the field,
it looks like a watch.

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:07.000
You have to have this
black thing, which

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.910
doesn't bend around your wrist.

00:27:10.910 --> 00:27:13.220
So we went on and shrink
radar hardware further.

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:17.270
So this is a very
tiny chip on the left.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:20.500
And here it is, a watch
with Soli radar inside.

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:23.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:24.583
And I have it on my wrist, too.

00:27:24.583 --> 00:27:31.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.615
It can even show time.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.455
That's how awesome
technology is.

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:44.210
So now our goal is not to
create just a smartwatch,

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:45.640
but to create
unique interactions.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.246
And I would like to invite
Nick Gillian, our lead Machine

00:27:49.246 --> 00:27:51.620
Engineer, Machine Learning
Engineer to show how it works.

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.430
But before he shows
it, let me kind of

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:57.730
give you a preview of what
you'll be seeing on the screen.

00:27:57.730 --> 00:27:59.560
What Soli allows
to do is to expand

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:03.090
interaction over the touchscreen
into the 3D space around it.

00:28:03.090 --> 00:28:05.747
So you don't have to use
a tiny screen to interact

00:28:05.747 --> 00:28:06.580
with what you watch.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:10.300
You don't have to try
to hit small targets,

00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.700
use the whole space around
the watch to interact.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.160
So we split the space
into two big parts.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.100
To interact with
information on the watch,

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:19.010
we use large gestures
around the watch.

00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:21.750
So you can move like this, and
you can scroll through messages

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:25.390
or see parts of the interface,
parts of information.

00:28:25.390 --> 00:28:28.010
And if you want to navigate
the interface of the watch,

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:29.274
you can use virtual tools.

00:28:29.274 --> 00:28:30.940
As we talked about
before, virtual dials

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.030
and virtual buttons, so you can
put your hand next to the watch

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:37.600
and use them to navigate
interaction and interface

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.369
elements.

00:28:39.369 --> 00:28:40.910
So let's take a look
at how it works.

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:42.820
And I'm going to get
Nick Gillan to show it.

00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:43.520
Nick up to you.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.520
NICK GILLIAN: Thank you.

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:49.380
OK, let's take a
look at the watch.

00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.130
You can see, as my
hand approaches,

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:53.670
it dynamically starts to react.

00:28:56.620 --> 00:29:00.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.400
Note how the responsiveness
and precision of radar

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:08.000
enables us to create these
continuous fluid interactions.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.040
The blue bar here, you can see,
corresponds to my proximity

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.370
to the device.

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:15.350
This enables me to glance at
information at a distance.

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:19.110
So here for example, I can see
I've got 4 unread messages.

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:21.070
If I come a little
closer, I can now

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:24.000
see the names of the
users who sent them.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.890
The precision of Soli enables me
to interact with minute detail,

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:31.840
such as this
scrolling typography.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:34.640
If I move a little
closer, I can now

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:39.410
preview the contents
of the first message.

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:42.880
You can see how Soli allows
us to take the contents

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:45.380
on the display, and
actually move them

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:48.170
to the space around the watch.

00:29:48.170 --> 00:29:52.580
And if I remove my hand,
it dynamically resets.

00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:56.090
OK, but what if I want to
interact with more detail.

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:57.190
That's easy.

00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:59.520
I just move my hand
closer to the watch,

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.590
and now I can use a
virtual dial gesture

00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:05.350
to interact with
the complications.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:12.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:15.430
So here you can see, I'm
using a virtual dial gesture

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.510
to rotate through these
various complications.

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:22.190
So we got the messages, the
weather, and the calendar.

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:24.430
These gestures
represent interactions

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:31.892
with physical controls, such
as using an analog dial.

00:30:31.892 --> 00:30:33.600
Because I don't have
to touch the screen,

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.950
we can get a lot more
information on the display.

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:40.187
And of course, just because
they're micro gestures,

00:30:40.187 --> 00:30:42.520
doesn't mean I have to do
them right next to the device,

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.960
they also work at a distance.

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:51.920
So let's select one of
the other applications.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.350
The weather, for example,
I remove my hand.

00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:56.910
And now I want to
come back in, I

00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:01.370
can instantly look at what the
next weather information is.

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:04.900
So you can see with just
a few Soli gestures,

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.590
we can already start to build
these rich interactions.

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:11.739
Soli embedded fully
on a smart watch.

00:31:11.739 --> 00:31:12.280
Back to Ivan.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.076
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:15.076 --> 00:31:16.617
IVAN POUPYREV: So
Nick, stay onstage.

00:31:16.617 --> 00:31:18.400
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.830
We have another demo, and
you are going to show it.

00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:23.444
You're very good at that.

00:31:23.444 --> 00:31:25.610
So when you are building
Soli just for smartwatches,

00:31:25.610 --> 00:31:28.310
we think of it as a generic
interaction platform

00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:31.360
to control all sorts of
devices, with a very simple set

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.800
of simple gestures.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.152
So to explore the use of
Soli beyond the wearables,

00:31:35.152 --> 00:31:36.610
we decided to take
it to the living

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:40.783
room, in collaboration with
Harman, and their JBL brand.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:48.760
So here Soli allows the control
of home devices from a distance

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.020
without touching them.

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.990
This is the very first
prototype is here with speakers,

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:54.100
very early work.

00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:57.480
But the idea here is exactly
the same interaction principles,

00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:01.270
and the same gestures that
we designed for watch, also

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:06.240
allow us to control the speaker.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:06.840
We can see.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.760
It's a different embodiment,
but the principle is the same.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.510
As it approaches
his hand, you can

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:19.420
see that the speaker
recognizes and reacts to it.

00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:21.800
So what are you
going to next, Nick?

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:24.730
NICK GILLIAN: Yeah, so note
that the interactions here

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:27.300
are much larger than the
watch, they are several feet.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:31.450
The sensor actually can
sense up to around 15 meters.

00:32:31.450 --> 00:32:34.450
So we can do some pretty
amazing stuff with this.

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:36.999
And this is the same
thing that's in the watch.

00:32:36.999 --> 00:32:38.290
IVAN POUPYREV: Same algorithms.

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:42.160
NICK GILLIAN: So as I approach,
I can now use the virtual tool

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:43.050
to turn it on.

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:44.490
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:46.680
OK, let's try another track.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.140
[MUSIC PLAYING] NICK
GILLIAN: What do you think?

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:50.850
The next one?

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:51.350
[BEPEPING]

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:53.250
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:32:53.250 --> 00:32:55.150
Yeah, that's pretty cool.

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:58.680
OK, but I can also
do other gestures.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:01.591
More immediate ones,
like shut it out.

00:33:01.591 --> 00:33:03.340
IVAN POUPYREV: Great,
thank you very much.

00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:04.590
NICK GILLIAN: Thanks everyone.

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:12.720
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.870
IVAN POUPYREV:
Thank you to Nick.

00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:17.599
So to conclude, Soli is
interaction and platform

00:33:17.599 --> 00:33:18.640
for connecting the world.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.050
It proposes new universal
interaction experience

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:24.210
across multiple connected
products of the future.

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:27.650
It can be wearable , mobile,
internet of things, automotive,

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.540
industrial-- it's all
up to your imagination.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.540
What it does, it offers
a third dimension

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:35.640
of interaction, which
compliments and enhances

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.530
other interaction modalities,
such as touch screen and voice

00:33:38.530 --> 00:33:39.120
input.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.740
We don't fight with
them, we work together.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:45.580
And working with our partners,
such as Harman, LG, and others.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:48.130
We want to bring this new
experience to products.

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:52.850
But you don't have to wait
until it becomes a product.

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:54.960
Next year we're launching
the next version

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.970
of a Soli development kit.

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:59.650
The Soli beta dev kit.

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:02.620
And this will be
embedded, low power,

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:03.870
and based on module design.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:07.830
So what you're going to have
is Soli going to be this size.

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:10.520
And you can put it in
your products or projects,

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:15.670
and explore the use of Soli
in your ideas and our designs.

00:34:15.670 --> 00:34:18.340
So we're looking forward
to exploring Soli with you.

00:34:18.340 --> 00:34:19.520
And that was Soli.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.320
Thank you.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:28.638
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:28.638 --> 00:34:29.679
DAN KAUFMAN: Pretty cool.

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:31.570
Yeah.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:33.790
Thanks to Nick
and Ivan and Paul.

00:34:33.790 --> 00:34:35.630
But mostly thanks
to Levi's, do I

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:37.530
have the coolest job
in the world or what.

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.389
All right, so I promised
you we would talk about Ara.

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:45.550
And for those of you
who may be new here,

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:48.010
Ara is our vision for
the future of phones.

00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:51.159
And even more so, our vision
for an entirely new hardware

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:52.506
ecosystem.

00:34:52.506 --> 00:34:54.880
For those of you who have been
following Ara for a while,

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:57.490
you may be wondering,
what's going on with Ara.

00:34:57.490 --> 00:34:58.620
Where is it?

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.256
And most importantly,
when do I get one?

00:35:01.256 --> 00:35:02.170
AUDIENCE: Woo.

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:03.380
DAN KAUFMAN: Yeah, woo.

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:06.049
So, well, Ara has made so
much progress over the year,

00:35:06.049 --> 00:35:08.090
and we've talked about
this journey from concept,

00:35:08.090 --> 00:35:09.131
to prototype, to product.

00:35:09.131 --> 00:35:10.960
It's made so much
progress this year,

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.644
it's actually spun out
into its own business unit.

00:35:13.644 --> 00:35:15.810
It's spinning out of Ara,
into another business unit

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:18.550
inside of Google, with
our boss Rick, who's here.

00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:19.900
Thanks for coming.

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.926
And it's going to be run
by Richard Woolridge.

00:35:21.926 --> 00:35:24.050
And here to tell you more
about it and the progress

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:26.880
that we've made, Rafa Camargo.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:31.430
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:33.180
RAFA CAMARGO: Thank you, Dan.

00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:36.110
All right, for the
last year, we've

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:40.730
been working with users,
developers, and partners.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:45.740
As a result, we've implemented
a new set of technologies

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:49.430
to create a seamless
modular experience.

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:55.460
Most importantly, we put
modularity where it counts.

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:56.270
Let's take a look.

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:04.490
This is the developer's
edition of Ara.

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:09.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:13.190
We've integrated the phone
technology in the frame,

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:18.450
that frees up space for mobiles,
that will create and integrate

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:21.610
new functionality that you
cannot get on your smartphone

00:36:21.610 --> 00:36:24.140
today.

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.130
It has six modular slots.

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:31.010
They're built for flexibility.

00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:33.990
You can put any
module, anywhere.

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:39.120
All the slots are generic,
and support any functionality.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:43.380
Each slot supports up to
11.6 gigabytes per second,

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.470
while consuming one
third of the USB3 power.

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:53.760
They are interconnected
via UniPro network.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:37:00.940
That allows you for example,
to route raw 4K video directly

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:03.840
to a computer
vision co-processor

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.740
for real-time processing.

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:12.360
It's ready for the most advanced
high performance applications.

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:17.220
Modules are designed to work
with a variety of form factors.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:20.480
Future frames can be
larger, they can be smaller,

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:25.610
or something completely
different than a smartphone.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:28.860
Current modules will
work with future frames.

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:32.320
Future mobile will work
with current frames.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:36.210
Protecting the investment
of both users and developers

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:36.710
in modulars.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:45.330
So how do you add
functionality to your Ara.

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:51.080
Step one, plug in a module.

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:56.530
Step two, use it.

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.260
OK, guys.

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:00.750
Smile.

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:03.520
There we go.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.890
It is that simple, that easy.

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:11.080
No rebooting your device,
no hunting for drivers.

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:14.380
And how do you remove a module.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:17.630
Well, you select the
module you want to release,

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:21.050
from the settings up.

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:22.040
Pop it.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.280
And then when I turn
it, so it doesn't fall,

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:27.140
it's just going to pop.

00:38:27.140 --> 00:38:28.600
Oh.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:32.547
I may have gone too far on
that, let me try that again.

00:38:32.547 --> 00:38:33.630
Let's try a different one.

00:38:33.630 --> 00:38:36.210
OK, Google, eject the camera.

00:38:36.210 --> 00:38:36.710
[POP]

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:39.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:40.165
There you go.

00:38:40.165 --> 00:38:42.655
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:42.655 --> 00:38:43.433
And put it back.

00:38:43.433 --> 00:38:49.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:50.980
Over this last year--

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:57.631
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:57.631 --> 00:38:58.130
All right.

00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:59.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:02.870
Over this last year,
we build a tech,

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:07.460
not just for a smartphone, but
for a truly modular computing

00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:09.010
platform.

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:14.830
Our silicone has implemented the
world's first UniPro network.

00:39:14.830 --> 00:39:18.560
High speed, low
power, and application

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:21.500
independent, future
proof and designed

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.270
from the ground up for mobile.

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:28.300
The modular connector is
built for the speed of UniPro,

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:32.120
and it's robust, up to
10,000 connect cycles.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:36.250
And the electromechanical
latch built with nitinol memory

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:40.036
alloy, in control
from software, as you

00:39:40.036 --> 00:39:45.220
saw, creating an intuitive
modular release experience.

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:50.860
Greybus, the Ara software
stack, enables runtime detection

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.800
and use of modules.

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.390
You just plug it, and it works.

00:39:56.390 --> 00:40:01.800
And we have abstracted all
this technology in a baseplate.

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.090
So developers can focus
on their technology,

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:09.600
while users will be guaranteed a
consistent user experience when

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.200
using our modulars.

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:18.900
The baseplate is the hardware
equivalent of a software API.

00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:22.510
Ara is an open platform.

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:26.360
We want to create a hardware
ecosystem on the scale

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:29.260
of the software up ecosystem.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.260
And to talk about what
we're doing with modules,

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:34.160
and what's next with
Ara is Blaise Bertrand,

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.180
our Head of Creative.

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:40.595
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:40.595 --> 00:40:41.970
BLAISE BERTRAND:
Thank you, Rafa.

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:43.170
Good morning, everybody.

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:44.990
So as we've been
developing the phone,

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:47.550
we've also been
creating modules.

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:51.560
And we started with modules
that improve current phone

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.970
functionalities-- better
speakers, high resolution

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:58.100
cameras, and expandable storage.

00:40:58.100 --> 00:41:01.260
But we also wanted
to make Ara personal.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:05.710
So we've developed modules with
woods, modules with concrete,

00:41:05.710 --> 00:41:09.040
and modules that we
added color to it.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.160
We've also been exploring
secondary displays,

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.400
various types of sensors,
and new technologies

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.360
that you can find
on phones today.

00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:22.240
Ara is the combination
of beauty and function.

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.920
But it's also about solving
specific user needs.

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:31.800
Diabetes, over six million adult
Americans, who have Diabetes,

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:34.830
check their glucose level
several times a day, OK.

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:38.360
And for that, they have
to carry many devices--

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.200
a phone and a glucometer.

00:41:42.730 --> 00:41:45.720
It turns out that pretty much
everything in a glucometer,

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.320
besides a few sensors,
is also in a phone.

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.680
So we thought hey,
what if we could

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:55.550
put all this into a module to
create a better glucometer.

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:57.670
Well, you know, it'd
be in your phone,

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:59.430
so it would be a lot
more compact, right.

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:02.590
And you could also add context
to your measurement by showing,

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:06.210
for instance, if you're
reading was done after sitting

00:42:06.210 --> 00:42:07.070
or after exercising.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:11.380
Now the great news
with Ara is that we

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:13.330
don't have to go it alone.

00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:14.910
As a matter of
fact, we have been

00:42:14.910 --> 00:42:17.110
partnering with best
in class companies

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:19.500
to develop modules with us.

00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:23.080
Companies that are already
familiar with a modular space.

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:26.670
Samsung Electro-Mechanics,
Micron, Sony Pictures Home

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:33.030
Entertainment, E Ink, Panasonic,
Wistron, TDK, Toshiba,

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:34.380
and Harman.

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:37.780
But other great companies that
build great products, and never

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:39.510
had the chance and
the opportunity

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:42.570
to have their
technology on phones.

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:49.100
Companies like Cohero,
iHealth, BACtrack, and goTenna.

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:52.080
So now we have a phone,
we have a set of modules,

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:54.140
and we have great
market partners.

00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:57.290
Well, now we need your help.

00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:58.910
So later this year
we'll be launching

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:00.860
the Developer Edition of Ara.

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:03.550
It will contain a
phone, a few modules,

00:43:03.550 --> 00:43:06.870
well specially anything
you need to start building.

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:10.170
So we'd like to ask you to think
about, what are the modules

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:12.780
that you want to create.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:15.600
But there's more to come.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:19.190
We've been working on the
consumer version of Ara.

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:24.230
It will be thin, it will be
light, it will be beautiful.

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:27.250
And we'll launch it next year.

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:32.670
Meanwhile, I'd like to give you
a glimpse of what life with Ara

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:33.510
could be like.

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:34.010
Thank you.

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:35.994
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:35.994 --> 00:44:42.458
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:44:42.458 --> 00:44:45.434
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:45.434 --> 00:44:47.290
DAN KAUFMAN: So thanks
to Rafa and Blaise.

00:44:47.290 --> 00:44:50.062
But, you know, Rafa and I have
worked together for a while.

00:44:50.062 --> 00:44:52.270
And you'd think he would
know a lot better than this,

00:44:52.270 --> 00:44:54.960
because he always says the
key is making Ara yours.

00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:00.320
And he left it up here,
well Ara's now mine.

00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:02.790
Thank you.

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:05.060
So as we said, we
wanted to end the show

00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:07.760
with talking a little bit
about Spotlight Stories.

00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.260
And one of the
reasons we want to do

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:12.390
that is a core tenet
of ATAP is to remember

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:15.800
not to lose the human inside of
all this technological wonder.

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:18.890
In two years ago, at AI,
Disney legend Glen Keane,

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:21.530
enchanted all of us
as he drew on stage

00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:24.570
and brought to life a
duet before our very eyes.

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:27.250
And last year, we had Justin
Lin's live action alien

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:31.240
takeover L.A. in 360, and
that shook our I/O session.

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.550
Well this year, we have a
really special treat for you.

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:36.790
But I can think of no better
way to talk about our latest

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:41.040
spotlight story, than just
introducing Rachid El Guerrab.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:42.764
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:42.764 --> 00:45:44.180
RACHID EL GUERRAB:
Thank you, Dan.

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:46.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.200
Thank you.

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:54.520
So 2016, has been a big
year for 360 and VR.

00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:56.990
Enthusiasts have
their early headsets,

00:45:56.990 --> 00:46:01.320
and 360 video and cameras
are now becoming mainstream.

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.420
The one question that keeps
coming up over and over

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:08.010
is, can we tell stories
in this new medium?

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:10.180
Can we make films,
like the ones we love

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:12.420
and the ones that move us?

00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:15.220
And we've been working
on this for a while

00:46:15.220 --> 00:46:19.440
now, before 360 cameras
and before the new VR.

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:23.650
And besides all the efforts
for capturing or creating

00:46:23.650 --> 00:46:28.610
an immersive world around you,
we cannot forget one important

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:31.430
and essential factor
in storytelling.

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:36.350
The stories have setups,
complications, resolutions.

00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:38.410
They have beginnings,
middles, and ends

00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:40.100
that need to make sense.

00:46:40.100 --> 00:46:43.840
And a structure, without
which we're easily confused,

00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:46.260
or maybe not interested.

00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:48.600
And what's most
important for being

00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.060
able to tell a story
to an audience,

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:52.885
is managing their attention.

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.070
It's easy for me to get
your attention, right now.

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:01.670
I'm here on the stage and
you're sitting in your chairs,

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:03.000
facing the right way.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.880
And you know that the next
thing is going to happen here.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:12.940
But when you're immersed in
a story, it's all around you.

00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:16.630
But how do we tell you,
where should you look.

00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:19.430
How do we tell you where the
next thing is going to happen?

00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:21.880
How do would keep you
from getting lost,

00:47:21.880 --> 00:47:26.710
or just missing an important
moment in the story?

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:30.770
Google Spotlight Stories
came out of this challenge.

00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:33.030
Of being able to create
immersive stories

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:34.780
with a structured narrative.

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.930
And giving filmmakers
the tools so they

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:40.550
can get the right impact from
their story, even when you

00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:43.230
the viewer are in
control of the camera.

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:45.930
And we do that through
interactive techniques.

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:49.460
That are attuned to manage
and respond to your attention,

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:52.300
as you're watching,
without you noticing.

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:55.660
We call it attentioneering.

00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:58.200
Let me give you some examples.

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:02.810
Our stories will wait for
you to look the right way.

00:48:02.810 --> 00:48:07.850
And where it's easy to get
lost in a big 360 video,

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:10.720
our camera will
dynamically guide you

00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.480
without taking control,
to get the best

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:14.810
framing for the action.

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:17.670
Like here, we see you're
interested in this monster

00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:21.070
and so will keep you on it.

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:22.645
And if you get
lost in the clouds.

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:31.050
We will not only reward
you with a change of music,

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:35.210
but a helpful actor will come
over and help you and guide you

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:36.390
back to the main story.

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:41.400
And if you're just
still curious,

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:43.420
and want to look around.

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:48.640
Well you might discover
subplots, gags,

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:52.750
and other scenes, because this
world is alive around you.

00:48:52.750 --> 00:48:54.670
Sometimes you have to
watch it over and over

00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:56.810
before you get all of them.

00:48:56.810 --> 00:48:58.240
And we know these
techniques work,

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:02.010
because we partnered with
award-winning filmmakers,

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:03.680
masters of their craft.

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:09.470
And we created actual
films in CGI animation,

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:13.690
in classic hand-drawn
animation, and even

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:16.790
Hollywood scale live-action.

00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:19.940
And with our story
Development Kit,

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:22.830
award-winning studios use
these and other techniques

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:25.340
to create their own films.

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:28.780
And push immersive
storytelling even further,

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:32.590
without one line of code.

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:36.500
In three years, eight
immersive interactive films

00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:39.280
with different styles
and different voices,

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.440
it's a VR film festival.

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:45.960
Now, with the enthusiastic
reception from the animation

00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:50.070
and film communities, but more
importantly, millions of people

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:52.560
have already experienced
these stories

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:54.790
through the window
of phone screen,

00:49:54.790 --> 00:50:02.000
with VR viewers like Cardboard,
and now with big VR headsets.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.390
All these different films run on
a tiny but powerful game engine

00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:10.190
doing real-time graphics and
animation, 360 video and audio,

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:15.180
and enabling film-like
content in real-time

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:17.170
on mobile hardware.

00:50:17.170 --> 00:50:20.760
This engine was squeezed
to less than 1 megabyte

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:23.150
of code, smaller than a codec.

00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:26.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:30.710
And was delivered to
billions of devices

00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:35.950
on one of the largest online
video platforms, YouTube,

00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:39.400
where these interactive
non-linear films are as

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:42.820
accessible as a regular video.

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:45.930
Now last Christmas, we
launched our first YouTube

00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:48.310
interactive shorts
called Special Delivery

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:52.060
from renowned studio
Aardman Animations.

00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:55.900
Unlike a linear video, the
full environment of the show

00:50:55.900 --> 00:50:58.940
had to be streamed and
reconstructed on your device

00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:00.610
in less than one second.

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:02.440
Because it's 3D
and it's real-time,

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:06.640
and you can look anywhere from
the first moment you see it.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:10.690
With our latest story,
we pushed our compression

00:51:10.690 --> 00:51:13.630
and non-linear streaming
techniques way further.

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:15.830
26 different
environments, each one

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:18.370
bigger than the whole
of the other story,

00:51:18.370 --> 00:51:21.050
each one lasting only
for a few seconds.

00:51:21.050 --> 00:51:23.430
And this is the first
show where we continuously

00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:25.650
cut from one shot
to the next, 38

00:51:25.650 --> 00:51:27.980
shots in less than six minutes.

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:31.070
And the engine has to throw away
a full environment every time,

00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:34.930
and bring in a new one each
time, seamlessly, perfect sync,

00:51:34.930 --> 00:51:37.260
without a hitch.

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:43.800
And more so with four ambisonic
tracks, specialized music,

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:47.640
and stereo music, and
3D positional audio,

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:51.910
this was the most complex and
rewarding sound experience

00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:54.240
we've ever created.

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.570
The story is called
"Pearl" and it's

00:51:56.570 --> 00:51:59.030
premiering today on YouTube.

00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:04.610
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:07.510
Now, before you go check it out.

00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:10.610
I would like you to hear
from the director himself.

00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:13.910
He's known for animation on
big Disney films like "Wreck-it

00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:17.490
Ralph," "Tangled",
and "Big Hero 6."

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:20.610
And he was supervising animator
on an Academy Award-winning

00:52:20.610 --> 00:52:22.790
shorts called "Paper Man."

00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:26.360
Last year, he picked up
his own Academy Award

00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:29.320
for a beautiful animated
short called "Feast."

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:32.950
And of course, what do you do
after you win an Academy Award,

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:35.090
you make a Spotlight Story.

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:37.920
So ladies and gentleman,
the creator of "Pearl",

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:39.078
Patrick Osborne.

00:52:39.078 --> 00:52:46.357
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:46.357 --> 00:52:47.690
PATRICK OSBORNE: Thanks, Rachid.

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:51.050
So a little over a
year ago, I showed up

00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:54.320
for my first time at Google,
right down the street here

00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:56.960
and met the amazing
minds at ATAP.

00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:01.650
And I took over one of their
famed whiteboard covered

00:53:01.650 --> 00:53:04.210
conference rooms and
began to draw up an idea.

00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:07.580
And I wanted to make something
memorable, beautiful,

00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:09.640
and maybe meaningful.

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:11.570
And I didn't know
it then, but I was

00:53:11.570 --> 00:53:13.540
very lucky to have met
this particular group,

00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:14.780
these geniuses at ATAP.

00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:17.970
Because I didn't know it yet,
but I was asking for something

00:53:17.970 --> 00:53:20.090
that was really hard,
maybe impossible to do.

00:53:20.090 --> 00:53:24.600
I wanted to make this short
Pearl a 6-minute fully animated

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:29.130
360-degree short, road
trip musical, that

00:53:29.130 --> 00:53:32.600
takes place entirely in
a beat up 1980 sedan.

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:35.100
With 15 characters,
more environments

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:38.770
than many feature
films, and just

00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:41.460
creating designing and creating
that many sets is a lot

00:53:41.460 --> 00:53:43.190
to handle, but on
top of that they

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:46.370
need to be rendered in
real-time on a phone.

00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:49.060
And apparently that's hard.

00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:51.090
So my background is animation.

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:54.000
And I've been working in feature
films for the last 13 years.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.200
And animators are
control freaks.

00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:00.900
We make everything from
scratch in every scene.

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:03.900
But this mobile
platform was different.

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:06.630
It was going to be a
film without a frame.

00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:08.390
The audience-- not
me, the director,

00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:10.670
gets to decide where
the camera goes,

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:14.780
and that feels like a lot of
control to give up at first.

00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:17.910
But I thought about maybe
turning those limitations

00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:22.450
into something that
would inspire the story.

00:54:22.450 --> 00:54:24.930
So filmmakers been
using artificial frames

00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:27.740
within frames since
the beginning of time

00:54:27.740 --> 00:54:29.850
or the beginning of film.

00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:33.160
If we set this film
entirely in a car,

00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:35.220
I could get my fill of
these pretty compositions

00:54:35.220 --> 00:54:39.490
by making frames with the
car windows themselves.

00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:41.540
So what kind of story
takes place in a car?

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:44.730
I love road trip movies,
so I thought maybe

00:54:44.730 --> 00:54:46.330
we would make one of those.

00:54:46.330 --> 00:54:49.670
And let the audience
sit-in the passenger seat.

00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:52.030
And treat it more like
theater than film,

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:53.980
where I try to
spotlight the action

00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:56.290
and direct the attention
of the audience.

00:54:56.290 --> 00:54:59.400
But its completely
OK if they wander.

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:01.500
And I made sure the story
would read, no matter

00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:03.710
what direction they were
looking, even if you're not

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:06.480
looking the right way.

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:10.810
So it would be some sort of road
trip giving tree kind of story.

00:55:10.810 --> 00:55:13.690
Maybe a story about
passing down your car.

00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:15.600
And I thought what
else do we pass on?

00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:19.020
Personality tastes
and talent, maybe.

00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:20.900
I used to draw with
my dad as a kid.

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.530
He's a toy designer.

00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:25.440
And I think more than any
of the physical things

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:30.730
he gave me, including my high
school '89 Civic hatchback,

00:55:30.730 --> 00:55:32.284
the most thing--
the thing I value

00:55:32.284 --> 00:55:33.700
most is the time
we spent together

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:35.150
drawing when I was a kid.

00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:38.490
He passed on a sense
of visual taste.

00:55:38.490 --> 00:55:40.410
And the love of
putting pen to paper.

00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:42.170
And I think considering
what I do now,

00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:46.260
it's probably the most
valuable thing he ever gave me.

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:49.170
So I decided to make Pearl
that, the story about passing

00:55:49.170 --> 00:55:53.630
on an object, your car,
but also handing down

00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:55.970
a passion or a talent.

00:55:55.970 --> 00:55:58.436
In this case, not drawing,
it was going to be music.

00:55:58.436 --> 00:55:59.560
It's going to be a musical.

00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:01.560
So it's going to
be a musical, we

00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:03.900
need a song to wrap
the whole story around.

00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:06.540
And I decided to structure
the story like a pop song

00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:09.920
itself-- like verse, chorus,
verse, chorus, bridge.

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.030
And this is a little
chart that I handed over

00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:17.700
to the composers at Pollen
Music to explain that.

00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.337
I don't know how
clear it exactly is.

00:56:19.337 --> 00:56:21.920
But it was to guide them through
this structure, and this idea

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:23.980
of how that song would be made.

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.950
So JJ Wiesler and
Alexis Harte wrote

00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:30.660
the beautiful original
song, "No Wrong Way Home."

00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:32.830
And it was performed
in the short

00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:35.030
by Kelley Stoltz
and Nicki Bluhm.

00:56:35.030 --> 00:56:38.650
Now, of course, "Pearl" is out
there in the world right now.

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:44.790
You could pull out your phone
and watch it on YouTube.

00:56:44.790 --> 00:56:49.292
But the song being such a core
central part of the story,

00:56:49.292 --> 00:56:51.000
I figured it would be
really cool for I/O

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.560
to actually bring Kelly
and Nicki here, and do

00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:57.930
