00:00:00.202 --> 00:00:02.466
 In the video about the potassium-sodium pump 

00:00:02.466 --> 00:00:06.204
 we talked about how it helps the cell to figure out 

00:00:06.204 --> 00:00:08.061
 its membrane potential of rest. 

00:00:08.061 --> 00:00:11.265
 This is done through the active pumping of 

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:14.423
 three sodium ions outside the cell, and two potassium ions inside the cell. 

00:00:14.423 --> 00:00:17.383
 We have a ratio of three to two, 

00:00:17.383 --> 00:00:19.589
 but it alone can not create 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:22.038
 membrane potential of rest. 

00:00:22.038 --> 00:00:24.581
 Besides the potassium-sodium pump, potassium ions can 

00:00:24.581 --> 00:00:27.762
 to go out of the cell through diffusion towards their concentration gradient. 

00:00:27.762 --> 00:00:29.863
 They pass from outside to inside. 

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:32.022
 Naturally, there is a balancing power 

00:00:32.022 --> 00:00:34.762
 or balancing factor. This is the charge. 

00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:37.397
 If the outside is more positive than the inside, 

00:00:37.397 --> 00:00:42.157
 positively charged ions, such as potassium ions, 

00:00:42.157 --> 00:00:44.502
 they will not want to go up there. 

00:00:44.502 --> 00:00:46.185
 The reason is their positive charge. 

00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:48.542
 Here is more positive than here. 

00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:50.805
 In fact, potassium ions will want to return to the cage. But because of its concentration gradient 

00:00:50.805 --> 00:00:52.721
 will be pushed to the bottom of this channel more often, 

00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:55.043
 than at the top. 

00:00:55.043 --> 00:00:56.401
 There will be a balance. 

00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:57.980
 They will begin to diffuse, 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.336
 but there will be no equalization of concentrations on both sides of the membrane, 

00:01:00.336 --> 00:01:02.925
 because the charge will hold them here (inside the cage). 

00:01:02.925 --> 00:01:04.620
 And what happens to sodium ions? 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.036
 Sodium ions are concentrated more and more 

00:01:06.036 --> 00:01:08.056
 here above. Therefore, the charge above is here 

00:01:08.056 --> 00:01:09.705
 increasingly positive. 

00:01:09.705 --> 00:01:11.644
 If we did not have a membrane 

00:01:11.644 --> 00:01:13.501
 and if we only looked at the concentration, 

00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:15.346
 sodium ions would naturally be 

00:01:15.346 --> 00:01:18.396
 to diffuse downwards. 

00:01:18.396 --> 00:01:21.136
 We have a high concentration gradient here 

00:01:21.136 --> 00:01:23.457
 and low here. 

00:01:23.457 --> 00:01:26.557
 If there was no membrane, the sodium ions would naturally have 

00:01:26.557 --> 00:01:28.101
 from a higher concentration point to a lower one. 

00:01:28.101 --> 00:01:29.877
 This is their concentration gradient. 

00:01:29.877 --> 00:01:32.013
 We said the membrane was 

00:01:32.013 --> 00:01:34.753
 much more positive than that, 

00:01:34.753 --> 00:01:38.131
 than from this one. 

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:40.511
 We can say there is a positive potential difference 

00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:42.693
 between this and that country. 

00:01:42.693 --> 00:01:45.874
 Therefore, positively charged ions, such as sodium ions here, 

00:01:45.874 --> 00:01:48.753
 will want to go down because of their charge. 

00:01:48.753 --> 00:01:50.576
 There are two reasons why they want to 

00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:53.339
 to move from this side of the membrane to that 

00:01:53.339 --> 00:01:54.477
 side of the membrane. 

00:01:54.477 --> 00:01:58.075
 Their concentration gradient and their charge, 

00:01:58.075 --> 00:01:59.236
 the electrical potential. 

00:01:59.236 --> 00:02:00.595
 There is potential energy that comes from their desire 

00:02:00.595 --> 00:02:02.974
 to escape from all these positive charges. 

00:02:02.974 --> 00:02:05.830
 Combined Motivation of 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.172
 sodium ions to move in that direction we call 

00:02:10.172 --> 00:02:13.105
 electrochemical gradient. 

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:16.465
 Electrochemical 

00:02:19.185 --> 00:02:20.285
 gradient. 

00:02:20.285 --> 00:02:22.414
 I already said it once, but I will repeat it. 

00:02:22.414 --> 00:02:25.583
 This is a combination of the electric gradient 

00:02:25.583 --> 00:02:26.419
 and the chemical gradient. 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:27.951
 We have a higher concentration in the chemical gradient 

00:02:27.951 --> 00:02:30.482
 here than here. Particles want to diffuse down. 

00:02:30.482 --> 00:02:32.037
 More particles will hit in this side of the membrane than 

00:02:32.037 --> 00:02:35.253
 in this. If she did not have the membrane, 

00:02:35.253 --> 00:02:37.076
 we would have a net stream of sodium ions down. 

00:02:37.076 --> 00:02:39.212
 But if we think about the electric potential, 

00:02:39.212 --> 00:02:40.953
 this country is more positive than that. 

00:02:40.953 --> 00:02:44.157
 Therefore, positive ions will want to move down. 

00:02:44.157 --> 00:02:46.630
 We can look at this gradient as a source of 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.418
 potential energy. 

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:50.449
 And the cells really use it 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:53.537
 sodium electrochemical gradient 

00:02:53.537 --> 00:02:55.093
 as a source of energy. 

00:02:55.093 --> 00:02:57.891
 Let's say this protein here 

00:02:57.891 --> 00:02:59.876
 is a symptom. 

00:03:01.818 --> 00:03:04.116
 This is a symbol. 

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:07.169
 He uses the electrochemical 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:11.871
 gradient of one ion, in this case sodium, 

00:03:11.871 --> 00:03:14.135
 uses that soda wants to 

00:03:14.135 --> 00:03:16.851
 go through the membrane. The simporter uses this energy. 

00:03:16.851 --> 00:03:19.405
 Imagine how the water falls from a waterfall 

00:03:19.405 --> 00:03:23.735
 can move a turbine or mill. 

00:03:24.734 --> 00:03:27.473
 Similarly, the symptom uses the energy of sodium, 

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:30.294
 which moves in the direction of its electrochemical gradient. 

00:03:30.294 --> 00:03:32.372
 Sodium wants to move in that direction for two reasons - 

00:03:32.372 --> 00:03:35.809
 concentration and electrical potential. 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:37.956
 Or we can say - electrostatic charge. 

00:03:37.956 --> 00:03:40.371
 The simporter uses this energy to transport other things. 

00:03:40.371 --> 00:03:43.215
 The most famous symptom is sodium 

00:03:43.215 --> 00:03:44.748
 and glucose. 

00:03:44.748 --> 00:03:46.895
 Sodium and glucose will be 

00:03:46.895 --> 00:03:48.277
 transported together. 

00:03:48.277 --> 00:03:49.867
 Glucose will be transported 

00:03:49.867 --> 00:03:52.433
 contrary to its concentration gradient. 

00:03:52.433 --> 00:03:53.733
 If we move something in the direction, 

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:57.076
 contrary to its concentration gradient, 

00:03:57.076 --> 00:03:59.630
 we must use active transport. 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.672
 Let's draw 

00:04:02.672 --> 00:04:05.551
 the concentration gradient of glucose to make it clearer. 

00:04:05.551 --> 00:04:06.549
 It looks like this. 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.486
 We have a high concentration in the cage 

00:04:09.486 --> 00:04:10.589
 low concentration outside of it. 

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:11.971
 The cell may not want to waste all this glucose, 

00:04:11.971 --> 00:04:14.571
 she wants to have as much glucose as possible 

00:04:14.571 --> 00:04:16.986
 in the interior. 

00:04:16.986 --> 00:04:18.855
 That is why you will need active transport, 

00:04:18.855 --> 00:04:21.130
 in order to transport glucose, contrary to its concentration gradient. 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.487
 To move in that direction. 

00:04:23.487 --> 00:04:25.205
 But here is the source of energy thanks, 

00:04:25.205 --> 00:04:27.109
 at which glucose transport will take place, contrary to its concentration gradient. 

00:04:27.109 --> 00:04:30.684
 The source is the potential energy coming in 

00:04:30.684 --> 00:04:33.343
 of the electrochemical gradient of sodium. 

00:04:33.343 --> 00:04:36.106
 Transport where 

00:04:36.106 --> 00:04:40.053
 we use energy accumulated from another species 

00:04:40.053 --> 00:04:42.723
 active transport - in our case the potassium-sodium pump, 

00:04:42.723 --> 00:04:45.625
 is called secondary active transport. 

00:04:45.625 --> 00:04:48.144
 What is going on in here? 

00:04:48.144 --> 00:04:51.800
 This sodium and glucose syringe performs secondary active transport. 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.339
 Secondary active transport. 

00:04:56.339 --> 00:05:01.049
 Uses the accumulated energy 

00:05:01.423 --> 00:05:04.941
 of the electrochemical gradient of one ion. 

00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:09.503
 Uses this accumulated energy to carry out active transport 

00:05:09.503 --> 00:05:12.440
 of another molecule - glucose, back to 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.047
 its concentration gradient.
