00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.320
We're asked to solve for x.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:07.060
And we have 9x squared minus
42x, plus 29 is equal to

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.420
negative 20.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.560
Now, you might be tempted
immediately to try to factor

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.080
the left-hand side of this
equation to get the product of

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.870
two binomials, and that they
equal negative 20.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:18.180
But if you think about
it, that's not

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.370
going to help you much.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.060
That product of two binomials
is only useful if they're

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.810
equal to 0.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.750
Then you can say, well, one
or both of them need

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.850
to be equal to 0.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.240
But you can't make any statement
like that if they

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.960
both equal negative 20.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.790
So the first thing we want to do
here is not to factor this

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.890
left-hand side, but to make sure
that we have a quadratic

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.840
equation equaling 0.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.680
We want a 0 on one side
of this equation.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.830
And the best way I can think of
doing that is just to add

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.210
20 to both sides of
this equation.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:51.000
So if we add 20 to both sides of
this equation, then we are

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:00.320
left with, on the left-hand
side, 9x squared minus 42x,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.209
plus 49 is equal to 0.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:09.390
Now we have a quadratic
expression equaling 0.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.660
Now we have a nice quadratic
equation, and we can factor

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.820
this thing on the
left-hand side.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.490
Now we could factor it by
grouping, but something might

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.790
immediately pop out at you.

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.170
And when you see numbers
like 9 and 49,

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.510
those are perfect squares.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.440
So maybe this whole expression
is a perfect

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.080
square of some binomial.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.760
So let's think about
it a little bit.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.055
9 squared is 3x squared.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:45.370
And 49 is 7 squared, or
negative 7 squared.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.810
And let's see, negative
42-- 3 times 7 is 21.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.690
21 times 2 is positive 42.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.020
But if we make this a negative
7, because negative 7 would

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.820
also work, negative 7
squared is also 49.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.950
Then 3 times negative 7,
times 2 is negative 42.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:07.830
Let me write that down.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.750
42 is 2 times 3, times
negative 7.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.150
So this fits the pattern
of a perfect square.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.210
So the left-hand side of this
equation, right here, we can

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:30.240
write it as 3x minus 7-- we
can write it as 3x minus 7

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.350
times 3x minus 7, or just
3x minus 7 squared.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.510
And that is going to
be equal to 0.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.460
Now, we essentially only have
one expression equaling 0,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.400
times itself.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.080
So the only way that's going to
be equal to 0, is if that

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.700
expression is equal to 0.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.400
3x minus 7 needs to
be equal to 0.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.700
And now we can just
solve for x.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.130
Let's add 7 to both sides of
this equation, and we get 3x,

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.200
these cancel out,
is equal to 7.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:09.410
Divide both sides by 3, and we
get x is equal to 7 thirds.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.610
x is equal to-- let me just
write it here-- x is

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.920
equal to 7 over 3.
