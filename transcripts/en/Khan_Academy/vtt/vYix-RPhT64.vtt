00:00:00.941 --> 00:00:03.129
- [Instructor] We are told
the population of a town

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:06.296
grows at a rate of e to the 1.2t power

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.587
minus two t people per year
where t is the number of years.

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:18.964
At t equals two years,
the town has 1,500 people.

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:23.101
First, they ask us
approximately by how many people

00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:24.738
does the population grow

00:00:24.738 --> 00:00:27.237
between t equals two and t equals five,

00:00:27.237 --> 00:00:28.993
and then what is the town's population

00:00:28.993 --> 00:00:30.893
at t equals five years.

00:00:30.893 --> 00:00:32.328
If we actually figure
out this first question,

00:00:32.328 --> 00:00:34.384
the second question is actually
pretty straight-forward.

00:00:34.384 --> 00:00:35.855
We figure out the amount that it grows,

00:00:35.855 --> 00:00:38.432
and then add it to what we
were at at t equals two,

00:00:38.432 --> 00:00:40.147
add it to 1,500.

00:00:40.147 --> 00:00:43.549
So pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:47.337
The key here is to appreciate
that this right over here

00:00:47.337 --> 00:00:50.457
is expressing the rate of how fast

00:00:50.457 --> 00:00:52.286
the population is growing.

00:00:52.286 --> 00:00:54.946
And we've then seen in
multiple videos now,

00:00:54.946 --> 00:00:57.687
let me just draw, do a quick review

00:00:57.687 --> 00:01:00.270
of this notion of a rate curve.

00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:05.868
So those are my axes, and this
is my t-axis, my time axis.

00:01:09.108 --> 00:01:11.871
And so this is showing
me how my rate of change

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:14.371
changes as a function of time.

00:01:15.787 --> 00:01:17.981
Let's say it's something like this.

00:01:17.981 --> 00:01:20.312
So once again, if I said at this time

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:22.068
right over here, this is my rate,

00:01:22.068 --> 00:01:25.290
this doesn't tell me, for
example, what my population is.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.072
This tells me what is my rate
of change of a population.

00:01:29.072 --> 00:01:31.449
And we have seen in previous videos

00:01:31.449 --> 00:01:34.112
that if you wanna figure
out the change in the thing

00:01:34.112 --> 00:01:38.548
that the rate is the
rate of change of, say,

00:01:38.548 --> 00:01:41.346
the change in population,
you would find the area

00:01:41.346 --> 00:01:45.046
under the rate curve between
those two appropriate times.

00:01:45.046 --> 00:01:46.867
And why does that make sense?

00:01:46.867 --> 00:01:50.254
Well, imagine a very small
change in time right over here.

00:01:50.254 --> 00:01:52.021
If you have a very small change in time,

00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:55.226
and if you assume that your
rate is approximately constant

00:01:55.226 --> 00:01:57.705
over that very small change in time,

00:01:57.705 --> 00:02:00.064
well, then your change in,
let's say we're measuring

00:02:00.064 --> 00:02:02.511
the rate of change of population here,

00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:04.708
your accumulation, you could say,

00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:08.903
is going to be your rate
times your change in time,

00:02:08.903 --> 00:02:11.203
which would be the area of this rectangle.

00:02:11.203 --> 00:02:14.040
And so roughly that would
be the area under the curve

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.627
over that very, very small change in time.

00:02:17.627 --> 00:02:20.574
What we really wanna do is
find the area under this curve

00:02:20.574 --> 00:02:23.760
from t equals two to t equals five.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.689
And we have seen multiple
times in calculus

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.298
how to express that.

00:02:27.298 --> 00:02:31.215
So the definite integral
from t is equal to two

00:02:32.305 --> 00:02:36.160
to t is equal to five of this expression

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.160
of e to the 1.2t minus two t dt, dt.

00:02:46.615 --> 00:02:49.266
So, if we just evaluate
that, that will be the answer

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:51.369
to this first question.

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:52.762
So what is this going to be?

00:02:52.762 --> 00:02:54.611
Well, let's actually work it out.

00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:58.528
So what is the antiderivative
of e to the 1.2t?

00:02:59.539 --> 00:03:01.226
Well, let me just try to do it over here.

00:03:01.226 --> 00:03:03.835
So if I am trying to calculate,

00:03:03.835 --> 00:03:08.410
let me write it as e to the
five, or actually 6/5 t.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.179
Say, 12/10 is the same thing as 6/5.

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:14.563
6/5 t dt, so this is
an indefinite integral,

00:03:14.563 --> 00:03:17.062
I'm just trying to figure
out the antiderivative here.

00:03:17.062 --> 00:03:19.450
Well, if I had a 6/5 right over here,

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.403
then use substitution, or
sometimes you would say

00:03:22.403 --> 00:03:24.756
the inverse chain rule,
would be very appropriate.

00:03:24.756 --> 00:03:26.742
Well, we could put a 6/5 there

00:03:26.742 --> 00:03:28.797
if we write a 5/6 right over here.

00:03:28.797 --> 00:03:31.331
5/6 times 6/5, then we can take constants

00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:33.267
in and out of the integral like this.

00:03:33.267 --> 00:03:35.249
Scaling constants, I should say.

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:39.515
Well, now, so this is
going to be equal to 5/6,

00:03:39.515 --> 00:03:41.083
this 5/6 right over here.

00:03:41.083 --> 00:03:43.288
This antiderivative is
pretty straight-forward.

00:03:43.288 --> 00:03:46.153
Since I have the derivative
of 6/5 t right over here,

00:03:46.153 --> 00:03:49.149
I can find the antiderivative
with respect to 6/5 t,

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:50.979
which is essentially I'm
doing u-substitution.

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.378
If you have to do u-substitution,
you would make that

00:03:53.378 --> 00:03:57.212
right over there u, and then
that and that would be your du.

00:03:57.212 --> 00:03:58.611
But, needless to say, this would be

00:03:58.611 --> 00:04:02.778
5/6 times e to the 6/5 t,
and if you're thinking about

00:04:04.018 --> 00:04:05.542
the indefinite integral,
you would then have

00:04:05.542 --> 00:04:07.565
a plus c here, of course.

00:04:07.565 --> 00:04:09.612
And you could verify that
the derivative of this

00:04:09.612 --> 00:04:11.612
is indeed e to the 1.2t.

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.247
So this is going to be equal to,

00:04:16.247 --> 00:04:18.212
so this part right over here,

00:04:18.212 --> 00:04:22.379
the antiderivative is 5/6 e to the 6/5 t,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.460
and then this part right over here,

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.472
the antiderivative of two t is t squared,

00:04:30.472 --> 00:04:32.055
so minus t squared.

00:04:32.962 --> 00:04:37.154
And we are going to evaluate
that at five and two

00:04:37.154 --> 00:04:38.605
and find the difference.

00:04:38.605 --> 00:04:41.890
So let's evaluate this at
when t is equal to five.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.406
Well, you are going to, and let me

00:04:43.406 --> 00:04:44.627
color-code this a little bit.

00:04:44.627 --> 00:04:47.907
When t is equal to five you get

00:04:47.907 --> 00:04:52.074
5/6 times e to the 6/5
times five is e to the 6th

00:04:53.596 --> 00:04:56.263
minus five squared, so minus 25.

00:04:57.938 --> 00:05:00.938
And so from that I want to subtract.

00:05:02.141 --> 00:05:04.891
When we evaluate it at two we get

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:10.946
5/6 e to the 6/5 times
two is the same thing

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:17.626
as 12/5, or we could say that's 2.4.

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.740
2.4 minus four, two squared is four.

00:05:25.262 --> 00:05:27.095
And so what do we get?

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:30.404
Well, there's a couple of
ways that we could do this.

00:05:30.404 --> 00:05:34.101
So then we could write this
as, let me write it this way,

00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:38.620
we could write this, so
we have a 5/6 and a 5/6,

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.787
so we could write this as
5/6 times e to the sixth,

00:05:44.631 --> 00:05:47.548
e to the sixth, minus e to the 2.4,

00:05:49.101 --> 00:05:52.235
minus 'cause we distribute
that negative sign,

00:05:52.235 --> 00:05:54.985
e to the 2.4, e to the 2.4 power.

00:05:56.844 --> 00:06:00.177
And then we have minus 25,
let me just get another color

00:06:00.177 --> 00:06:01.468
to keep track of it.

00:06:01.468 --> 00:06:05.444
We have minus 25, and then
you have minus negative four.

00:06:05.444 --> 00:06:07.202
So that would be plus four.

00:06:07.202 --> 00:06:09.369
So that would be minus 21.

00:06:10.748 --> 00:06:13.430
And I would need a calculator
to figure this out,

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:15.450
so let me do that.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.950
Let me get my calculator on this computer.

00:06:19.806 --> 00:06:21.345
And, there we go.

00:06:21.345 --> 00:06:24.280
And so let's see, if we wanna find

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.282
e to the sixth power, that's 403, okay,

00:06:28.282 --> 00:06:32.032
now let me figure out,
so minus, I would say,

00:06:35.157 --> 00:06:38.762
20, 2.4, that looks like
a 24, I'll correct it

00:06:38.762 --> 00:06:40.968
as soon as I get back to that screen.

00:06:40.968 --> 00:06:44.498
E to that power, e to the 2.4 power.

00:06:44.498 --> 00:06:47.525
And I get equals, so what's in parentheses

00:06:47.525 --> 00:06:50.951
is this number right here, so times 5/6.

00:06:50.951 --> 00:06:55.118
Times five divided by six
is equal to that minus 21.

00:06:57.923 --> 00:07:00.173
Minus 21, is equal to this.

00:07:01.452 --> 00:07:04.299
So, if I round to the nearest
hundredth it's going to be

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:06.049
approximately 306.00.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.867
So this is approximately 306.00.

00:07:13.175 --> 00:07:16.053
So approximately by how many
people does the population grow

00:07:16.053 --> 00:07:17.967
between t equals two and t equals five?

00:07:17.967 --> 00:07:20.722
Well, by approximately 306 people.

00:07:20.722 --> 00:07:23.136
Let me write that down.

00:07:23.136 --> 00:07:25.647
So approximately 306 people.

00:07:25.647 --> 00:07:27.136
And they say, what is
the town's population

00:07:27.136 --> 00:07:28.735
at t equals five.

00:07:28.735 --> 00:07:32.863
Well at time two at two
years we had 1,500 people.

00:07:32.863 --> 00:07:37.030
And then we grow over this
interval by 306, so plus 306.

00:07:39.634 --> 00:07:41.727
Well, that's gonna get me to,

00:07:41.727 --> 00:07:43.506
we deserve a little bit of a drum roll,

00:07:43.506 --> 00:07:46.506
1,806 people at t equals five years.
