Vertex and fragment shaders give programmers a lot of power over the GPU.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.299
However, some elements of most GPUs have transistors dedicated to them. Check

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.631
the elements in the pipeline that are hardwired and not currently programmable,

00:00:11.631 --> 00:00:17.519
at least not to any great extent. What's available hardwired on the GPU? The

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:22.118
illumination model, vertex transformation, Z-buffer evaluation, image

00:00:22.118 --> 00:00:26.790
processing, such as color correction or edge detection, rasterization and

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.380
interpolation, clipping. All the hardwired elements don't necessarily have to

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.268
be used by the programmer. You should check off those capabilities that are

00:00:36.268 --> 00:00:37.190
available.
