MAGGIE JOHNSON:
The way that Google

00:00:03.237 --> 00:00:06.474
started was an academic venture.

00:00:06.474 --> 00:00:08.964
JEFF DEAN: How do you
find interesting problems

00:00:08.964 --> 00:00:09.663
in the world?

00:00:09.663 --> 00:00:11.454
ALFRED SPECTOR: Google
depends on academia.

00:00:11.454 --> 00:00:14.442
So many of the good ideas
that we've brought forward

00:00:14.442 --> 00:00:15.936
into the world
come from academia.

00:00:15.936 --> 00:00:18.996
JEFF DEAN: One of the real
reasons to engage with academia

00:00:18.996 --> 00:00:20.928
is to get a really
fresh perspective.

00:00:20.928 --> 00:00:22.428
MAGGIE JOHNSON: We
empower academics

00:00:22.428 --> 00:00:24.922
to work on real problems
and in the other direction,

00:00:24.922 --> 00:00:27.814
academics bring ideas
and new approaches,

00:00:27.814 --> 00:00:30.994
and are put into practice
much more quickly

00:00:30.994 --> 00:00:33.414
than in an academic environment.

00:00:33.414 --> 00:00:34.866
JEFF DEAN: Oh,
that's interesting,

00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.824
and that's interesting,
and that's interesting.

00:00:36.824 --> 00:00:38.738
All of the sudden,
you've knitted together

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:40.690
something that is really,
really tremendously powerful.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.064
MAGGIE JOHNSON: We need their
help because of the problem

00:00:43.064 --> 00:00:44.471
we're trying to
solve internally.

00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:46.936
ALFRED SPECTOR: Academia can
look far out into the future,

00:00:46.936 --> 00:00:50.387
and can take greater risks and
look for really interesting

00:00:50.387 --> 00:00:52.852
solutions that industry
sometimes cannot.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.390
JEFF BURKE: "Grace Plains"
is a live action role-playing

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.785
game with Glass that we
developed in a class at UCLA

00:01:11.785 --> 00:01:13.830
in the school of
Theater, Film and TV.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.850
And it involved our students
in film, television,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.800
digital media, and theater and
computer science Ph.D. students

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.080
working with YouTube Space with
some of the Glass developer

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.090
relations folks
and the Glass team

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.890
to mount this live
action role-playing

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.350
experience that used Glass.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.860
This is sort of an ancient
relationship between the tools

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.667
that you have to tell
stories and the stories

00:01:35.667 --> 00:01:37.500
that you want to tell
and how you tell them.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.390
And so I think for
us Glass was really

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.620
a inspiration in terms of both
the themes of the story-- you

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.480
see a little bit of that in
the relationship between people

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.310
and technology in the
story-- and then also

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.800
in terms of the capabilities
of how we could bring

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.880
an audience into an
intimate interaction

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.710
with the story that
was unusual for them.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.043
JANINE GIANFREDI: We launched
the Glass Explorer program

00:02:00.043 --> 00:02:02.122
because we wanted to
get this new technology

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:04.080
in the hands of people
who are going to use it,

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.980
to experiment with it
and try new things.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.070
We knew that
filmmakers were a group

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.490
that we wanted to
have experimenting

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.960
with the technology.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.290
And so we announced the
Glass Creative Collective,

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.690
where we would invite several
film schools in the US

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.730
to participate in the
Explorer program with us.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.150
Where they would
use Glass to help

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.260
us understand how it can be
used as a filmmaking tool,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.010
as an aid for storytelling,
and, frankly, for open canvas

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.730
of all the different ways
that filmmakers and students

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.150
and faculty would
be able to help

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.059
us understand
Glass in the Space.

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.600
JEFF BURKE: We wanted
to do something

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.140
that was a role-playing
style experience,

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.640
and the story then evolved out
of a number of conversations

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.367
that were trying to look
at how could we take people

00:02:51.367 --> 00:02:52.950
through a role-playing
experience that

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.840
was unusual and
specific to Glass

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.110
and was something original.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.460
But it came from all
of these initial ideas

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.300
about how exciting it would
be to give people the ability

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.150
to encounter a
story as individuals

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.240
and then collectively
participate

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.220
in seeing it through.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.870
At the Space, the
students ran pretty much

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.670
all of the production.

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.050
They did everything, from
the design of the spaces,

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.070
they shot that sort
of teaser video,

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.690
they ran all of the
video, they managed

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.282
the events and all that.

00:03:27.282 --> 00:03:28.740
Everything that
was happening, they

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.070
were really taking the lead on.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.430
We had students from our
Department of Film, Television

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.100
and Digital Media, and students
from our Department of Theater.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.974
And then we had invited
some computer science

00:03:36.974 --> 00:03:40.550
Ph.D. students to the class
to help us sort of understand

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.060
the really deep possibilities
and work with some

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.390
of the core capabilities that
we thought existed in Glass.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.830
And so that was the
team of students

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.860
who developed the story,
and really the way

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.490
that it would unfold.

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.400
And then we tried to
bring them in contact

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.190
with other faculty
who were directing,

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.960
or new media faculty with
people that could provide advice

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.100
on the writing with the
production teams here,

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.070
and through those disciplines
all coming together

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.430
try to make a really
engaging experience.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.300
When the opportunity
came up to try

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.182
to execute this
particular project here

00:04:15.182 --> 00:04:16.640
we really leapt at
it, because what

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.100
it allowed us to do was to raise
the level the level not only

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.100
of the execution, but
creatively where we

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.790
could go in terms
of the technology.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.210
And so that was an offer
that was made as a research

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.900
experiment to do here in
the context of the Space,

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.665
and we thought this
was an opportunity

00:04:34.665 --> 00:04:35.764
that we couldn't pass up.

00:04:35.764 --> 00:04:37.430
LIZ HARNETT: The
philosophy of the Space

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.410
is about making the production
equipment that we have here

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.110
in the facilities
accessible to anybody,

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.460
whether or not they have
a film school background

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.220
or they have any sort
of formal training.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.490
And we're all about
experimentation

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.770
here, so the chance to do a
really cool role playing game

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.260
style experience was
something that we'd never

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.580
tried here at the Space.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.570
The YouTube Space building
played the role of the "Grace

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.185
Plains" laboratory,
and so as soon

00:05:04.185 --> 00:05:06.030
as participants
walked in the door

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:07.860
they were immersed
in this experience,

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.450
feeling as if they were entering
the actual laboratory where

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.420
these experiments
were taking place.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.280
JEFF BURKE: This was a
really amazing opportunity

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.990
for the students to think
about how could they structure

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.090
an experience that
had pre-built elements

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.760
and then improvised elements and
then a public that you weren't

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.530
controlling.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.215
Not exactly, right?

00:05:31.215 --> 00:05:32.590
And so I think
what we learned is

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.060
these things can go together.

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.470
They can generate
compelling experiences

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.240
and wearable computing
Glass, in particular,

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.530
is a really nice
platform to experiment

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.050
with because of the way
you can relate individually

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.749
to every participant and
yet have them do something

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:48.290
collectively.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.900
So I thought this mixture
of individual and collective

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.980
participation through the
platform was one of the things

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:57.870
that we learned about.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.510
How to execute
it, that it works,

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.330
that we want to do more with it.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.830
JANINE GIANFREDI:
I was particularly

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.580
excited to have Jeff
and his team involved

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.730
in the collective, because
they have all this development

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.370
expertise as well as the
filmmaking and theatrical

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.400
backgrounds.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.800
And so when we
started talking, I

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.520
realized this is going to start
going in a whole new direction,

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.790
and they're going to experiment
a lot more with Glass

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:22.955
than we had originally
thought about when

00:06:22.955 --> 00:06:24.430
we launched the program.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.350
So for us, the
opportunity to have

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.850
Glass participating
in a narrative,

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.370
rather than just capturing
it, and whether that's

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.640
done through automated functions
or you have somebody actually

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.890
directing the experience
from behind the scenes

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.990
or even actually as a
participant and director,

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.280
these are opportunities with
this particular technology

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.180
that we hadn't really
set out to explore.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:54.010
And we learned a ton just
watching "Grace Plains" unfold,

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.000
and also the global
brand as well.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.810
There's all these different
ways of approaching narrative

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.930
direction and
storytelling that we're

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.180
excited to see
continue to evolve,

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.860
and more experiments
around them.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.370
LIZ HARNETT: Having
UCLA come in,

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:10.390
it helped to raise the
bar for our community

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.510
and get them to think a little
bit more outside the box.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:19.100
And also to inspire us and
our engineers and folks

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:23.300
in the product team to come up
with new features for YouTube

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.550
that are going to help
creators to tell those stories.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.880
JEFF BURKE: I think
what's unique about Glass,

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.890
at least as we've
encountered so far,

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:32.160
is the relationship
to the wearer.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.450
And that this idea of being
able to address individuals

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:39.800
within a context where they're
interacting with other people

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.750
is really exciting.

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:46.410
And the challenge of using
computing in a storytelling

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.660
experience, whether it's a
mobile device or something

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.660
else, is that there's a lot of
mediation involved between you

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.800
and other people when
you're looking at a screen.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:59.690
And so the idea that you can
receive story information

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:02.240
or you can
participate in a story

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.800
while still being able to
interact with other people

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.429
was really exciting.

00:08:06.429 --> 00:08:08.720
It's sort of the fundamental
capability that ultimately

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.740
was what the students
decided to explore,

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.470
in some context for a performer,
so that performer could really

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.620
continue to engage with
the world around them

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.400
while getting story
information and updates.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:24.410
And in other contexts
with the public,

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.120
to have this overlay
between the interactions

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.260
they had with individuals, with
each other, and the story that

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:32.697
was coming to them
through Glass.

00:08:32.697 --> 00:08:35.280
JANINE GIANFREDI: That actually
for us was really interesting.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.590
Glass is designed to be
close to your senses,

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:42.110
and so you guys really
took that part of Glass

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.930
and that value of
Glass and turned it

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.440
into something beyond
what we had imagined,

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.540
which was just really
cool to see that

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.060
from so many different
participants in the experience.

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:57.510
JEFF BURKE: I think the notion
of interacting with performers

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.560
is very powerful and
very interesting.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:02.860
And it gives us a whole
other palette of things

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:04.730
to try in the
context of a training

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:06.534
environment of a
professional school that

00:09:06.534 --> 00:09:07.950
has performers at
the heart of it.

00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:13.240
And I think I have a
lot of ideas, creatively

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:16.580
and personally, that
relate to that connection

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.720
between performers,
content, and audience,

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.900
or performers and a
story and an audience

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.644
that I think I'd like to--
I hope that we can explore.

00:09:23.644 --> 00:09:25.060
JANINE GIANFREDI:
I hope to see it

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.799
start to become a part
of that as you plan out

00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:28.840
what you're going to use.

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.410
Glass is one of those tools, in
part because of the perspective

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.235
you get wearing Glass,
the fact that it

00:09:34.235 --> 00:09:37.250
is close to your senses, and
the fact that you can engage

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.510
a subject in a
really different way.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:43.310
But I also hope to see
Glass used more in the way

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:47.710
that Jeff's group did, which
is really getting inputs

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.750
from somebody and then
reacting to them as an actor.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.450
Or maybe not as an actor, but
as a participant in there.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:56.720
So again, I had never
really thought of it

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.220
as being a part of the story.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:01.570
I thought it was going to
be a bit in the backdrop.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:04.170
And so we really want
to see more of that

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.290
as it continues to evolve.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.500
And the other piece that's
been really exciting

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.220
about the Creative Collective is
we've gotten a lot of feedback

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:14.332
on the product itself, and
how it works really well,

00:10:14.332 --> 00:10:15.790
and some of the
challenges that are

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.260
encountered when using
it for storytelling.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:21.884
And so that's helping us think
through further iterations

00:10:21.884 --> 00:10:23.550
and improvements we
can make, and things

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:25.412
that we can change
and shift a bit.

00:10:25.412 --> 00:10:26.870
JEFF DEAN: If you
want to hear more

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.661
about "Grace Plains"
and the other projects

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:31.060
that we did with
Glass at UCLA, stay

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.490
tuned for the tech talk
at YouTube Space LA.
