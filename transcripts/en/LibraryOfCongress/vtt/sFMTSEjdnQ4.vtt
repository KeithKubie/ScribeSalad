&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.550
&gt;&gt; Michelle Cadoree
Bradley: Good morning.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.860
I'm Michelle Cadoree Bradley, a
research specialist in the Science,

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.610
Technology and Business Division
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.360
This is the tenth season of our
collaboration with NASA Goddard.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.210
And today is the second
lecture in the eight

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.960
that we have planned
for this season.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.510
There is a list available
outside the theater

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.370
and you can always check our
website to see what's coming up.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.920
The 2014 movie "Interstellar"
has a team of astronauts set

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.020
out to explore a system of planets
orbiting a super massive spinning

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.730
black hole named Gargantua.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.700
Searching for a world that may
be conducive to hosting uni-life.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.270
With theoretical physicists,
Kip Thorne as a science advisor,

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.250
the film has been praised for its
high level of scientific accuracy.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.880
But what is science,
and what is Hollywood?

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.920
This presentation will
address the habitability zone

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.820
around super mass black holes.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.800
And will discuss the
Hollywood movie,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.120
in light of the physics
governing accretion,

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.110
relativity, and astrobiology.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.810
I'm very excited to present
Dr. Jeremy Schnittman,

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.830
a research astrophysicist at
NASA's Goddard Space Light Center.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.030
He has a doctorate
in physics from MIT,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.120
and his research interest
include theoretical

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.350
and computational modeling of
black hole accretion flows.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.850 position:56%
Black hole binaries and other things

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.710
that I cannot pronounce
at this time.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.510
Please welcome Dr.
Jeremy Schnittman.

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:17.290
[ Applause ]

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.590
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Schnittman:
Thank you so much ladies

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:19.940
and gentlemen, it's
great to be here.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.240
It's really fun.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.610
I love talking about black holes.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.230 position:56%
So really you guys are doing me a
favor to let me come and just go on,

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.770
and on, and on about, well it's not
just my hobby it's actually my job

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.820
which is a pretty exciting
place to be.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.950 position:56%
So I will be talking about the
science of "Interstellar" the movie.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.830
You know there's a tendency
especially of physicists

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.840
to watch science fiction
movies and try

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.400
to pick apart every single
little hole in the plot, or well,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.940
we used to call it at MIT, the well
actually effect because you say,

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.500
well actually that wouldn't
really happen that way.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.600
So I'm going to really
try to avoid that approach

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.870
because of my great enjoyment of
the movie and my great respect

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.080 position:56%
for Kip Thorne who is the heart,
and mind, and soul behind the movie.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.300
So rather than think of this really
as a critique or a commentary

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.780
on the movie, I like to think of
it as kind of like a tribute band

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.570 position:56%
to the Beatles, to you know they
can do things a little bit their own

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.000
way, but really the heart and soul
of it is coming from Kip Thorne.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.490
So maybe out in the cart outside,
but I brought my own copy right.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.880
So if anything more you want
to learn about the science

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.000 position:56%
of "Interstellar" that I don't cover
in the talk is really well laid

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.060
out in Kip's recent books.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.670
Some of us actually think
that he got Hollywood

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.950
to make the movie to
help sell the book.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:04:00.260
And you know it's really
a great introduction.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.370
If you like that a somewhat
more technical book,

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:05.950
but still basically a
popular science book

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.920
and I would say my all-time
favorite science book is Kip's book

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.340
about black holes and time
warp which is "Black holes,

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.790
Gravitational Waves, Time Travel."

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.630
And the if you're really in
for the heavy duty lifting,

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.210
literally right is
what we call the bible.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.830
"Gravitation" by Misner,
Thorne, and Wheeler.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.580
Also is "Magnum Opus."

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:42.460
Got my signed copy.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.440 position:56%
Okay so in addition to acknowledging
Kips' tremendous contribution

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.290
to the field, and this
moving in particular,

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:01.690
I also want to give credit to
my boss, astronaut Piers Sellers

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.830 position:56%
who is both an astronaut, a
scientist and a construction worker.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.050
He built the International
Space Station.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.880
So Piers is an earth
scientist by training.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:20.780
And he's also been a tremendous
advocate and supporter of a lot

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.250
of the work that I do and that
I'll be talking about today

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.910
in particular the intersection
of earth science, climate,

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:32.160
exoplanets, and astrophysics.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.240
Which is one of the great
things about NASA Goddard is

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.860
that we have all these different
disciplines all working together

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.190
and learning from each other.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.850
This is an older picture of Kip.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.310
I just noticed this morning.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.500
See, he's got the Tesla
medallion there, upside down,

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.690 position:56%
but clearly a man ahead of his time.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:06:00.030
More recently he's been named one
of the 100 most influential people

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:03.520
by "Time Magazine" is a great
little blurb actually written

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.790
by Christopher Nolan.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.270
So he's really become a rock star.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.230
In fact, we just learned
this morning that Kip

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:18.350
and his collaborators, at Ligo the
gravitational wave detector have

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:25.560
been awarded the Breakthrough I
think it's called the Foundation

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.860
Prize in physics.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.180
Essentially Nobel scale
$3 million prize

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.190
through their discovery
of gravitational waves.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.010
And then here's a picture
from this weekend with Piers

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:43.790 position:56%
and another Hollywood personality
who came to visit, Leonardo DiCaprio

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:50.790
for those of you like me, came to
visit Goddard this weekend to learn

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:55.300
about some of the research
we're doing there on climate.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.150
So, let's you know we're
going to cover a lot

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.120
of different topics today.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:08.370 position:56%
Climate, black holes, gravitational
waves, particle physics, exoplanets.

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:14.850
Here's just a good primer on, I
imagine some of you have heard

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.520
over the last 20 years
we've discovered

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.890
over 2000 plants orbiting stars
outside of our solar system,

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.810
extra solar planets, or exoplanets.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.980
And here's a plot of just some of
the properties of those planets.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.080
And it's also a good opportunity
to introduce, just to make sure

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.940
that we're somewhat
all on the same page,

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.530
the concept of what we
call a log log plot.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:47.210
Right, you see the x-axis
is units of semi-major axis.

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:52.740
The distance of a planet
from its start in these kind

00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.000
of archaic units we
call astronomical units.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.300
Not very descriptive,

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.580
but an astronomical unit
is a unit of distance.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:05.660
One astronomical distance is the
distance from the earth to the sun.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.120
So there's one astronomical unit.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.440
So all of the planets on this
side are closer to their stars

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.170
than the earth is to the sun.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:17.450
And then here's the planet's mass

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.990
with that scale relative
to the earth.

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.100
So there's one earth
mass, 10 earth masses.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:31.210 position:56%
And you see that these log log plots
their spacing increases as you go

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.940
to the right or as you go up and
it's very useful for physicists

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.780
to use these because
we can cover many,

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.370
many orders of different
scales on a single plot.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:44.430
So you know these planets are
10 times heavier than these,

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.550
and 10 times heavier
than these etcetera.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:51.420
Jupiter is up here about 1000
times the size of the earth.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:56.150 position:56%
So we have this big clump of planets
up here what we call hot Jupiter's,

00:08:56.150 --> 00:09:01.120
very massive planets, orbiting
very close to their host stars.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.750
And then you see a whole
bunch of planets down here,

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.370
which are now called this growing
class of planets discovered

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.810
by the Kepler Mission
are called sub Neptune's.

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:13.850
So they're basically between
the size of Neptune and earth.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:15.990
There's no analogue in
our own solar system,

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.270
but it turns out these are
some of the most common planets

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:21.540
in the entire galaxy and a lot

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.530
of them orbit very close
to their host star.

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.000
Now you see there's really
nothing else quite like earth.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.300
Now, that's not really true,

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.790
it's just we haven't found
anything else quite like earth yet.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.930
Because these planets
that orbit very close

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:39.490
to their stars are much
easier to see for two reasons.

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:43.500 position:56%
One, because we use this one
technique that looks for the wobble.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.210
You probably heard of this, right
you look at the wobble of the star

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.700
as it's getting pulled
by its planet.

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.600
And another technique is you
actually look for little shadow

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:59.010
as the planet passes in front of
the star, decreasing the light

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:01.550
from the start by even
a fraction of a percent.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.840
So both of those techniques
are much easier to use

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.040
when the planet is
very close to the star.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.090
So that's why we kind
of have this tendency

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:14.070
to discover a lot more planets
that are close to the stars,

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.180
or these ones that are
far away, but very massive

00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:19.870
so cause a very big
pull on the star.

00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:23.980
So really it's just a question of
time until we push this plot down

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:28.190
and to the right to discover
the true earth like planet.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:32.160
In fact, another fortuitous
event in the news

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:37.350
that I just saw yesterday was
new planetary system discovered

00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:40.840
by a European group with just
a relatively small telescope,

00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.260
about a two-foot telescope
down in Chili,

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.210
they found which now
they claim which is kind

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.630
of the new claim every
four months or so.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:53.220
The most earth-like exoplanet
has yet again been discovered.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:57.570
A system of three planets, they're
orbiting so close to their start

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.120
that it only takes two
days for the planet

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.310
to go all the way around the star.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.450
A two-day year.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:09.710 position:56%
But even so, the star that they're
going around is so small and so dim,

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.220 position:56%
that it actually could be habitable.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.480
It wouldn't be that
hot on this planet,

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.150
even though it's only
in a two-day orbit.

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:22.210
So those are the guys down
here, so about one earth mass,

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:27.770
but much closer to their host
star and yet what I've put in here

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.200
with the color scale
is the temperature

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.540
of the star right smaller
stars are cooler.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:36.880
So you can basically
afford to get closer to them

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.010
without betting burnt up.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.860
So this, even though they're
not really like earth,

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.650
and life on these planets
could be very different,

00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:47.990
it could at least be possible.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.040
So this is really the exciting
direction that the study

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.550
of exoplanets is going now.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.940
So let's get a little
bit more into details

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.810
about that idea of
the habitable zone.

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:01.980
What makes a planet habitable.

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:07.550
So we start off by saying that
we want it to have liquid water

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.250
on the surface of the planet.

00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:14.120
Now, we know, you know that we're
somewhat limited by our imagination

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.300
as how life works on earth.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.040
There's water, it's on the surface,

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.810
it seems to be an important
part of life.

00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:24.010
It's not simply that we're
limiting our imagination

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.680
by requiring liquid
water on the surface.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.620 position:56%
There are, you know moons of Jupiter

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.360
that now we believe have liquid
water under two kilometers

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.960
of solid ice and could very
well actually host life.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.010
But if you want to see
that life with a telescope

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:43.320
from 20 light years away it
really helps for it to actually be

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:48.750
on the surface and interacting with
the atmosphere so you know leaking

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.520
out methane into the
atmosphere for us to detect

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:55.100
without telescopes
and spectrometers.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:00.180
So for those purposes we're going
to use as working definition

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:03.620
of what we call the
habitable zone is any planet

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:07.540
that has enough energy
coming from its host star

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.290
so that the surface
temperature of the planet will be

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.320
between freezing and boiling.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.930
And also since we want it on a
surface, we're going to throw

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:21.750
out planets like Neptune and
Jupiter, which are just giant balls

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.390
of gas, because they don't
really have a surface.

00:13:24.390 --> 00:13:27.950
So if you want you know little
creepy crawly things to crawl

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:31.590
out of the ocean onto the
shore, you better have an ocean

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:33.060
and you better have a shore.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.850 position:56%
So we're going to focus for the rest
of the talk really on rocky planets,

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:41.110
kind of earth, Mars,
Venus type of planets.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:45.680
And we want to see which of these
planets are in this habitable zone,

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.140
sometimes called the
Goldilocks zone.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:52.340
Not too hot so that all the water
would literally boil off the planet

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:53.880
and escape into space.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.900
And not too cold where
everything would just freeze over.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.640
So here's another one
of those log log plots

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.790
where again we're plotting
the distance

00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:04.320
from the star on the bottom.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.880
But instead of the planet's
mass, now we're plotting the mass

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:10.400
of the star that the
planet is going around.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.590
So here's one, you know
relative to the sun.

00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:19.120
So this is the sun and then these
little dots are the solar system

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.420
planets right?

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.460
Mercury, Venus, Earth,
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:26.510
And this yellow band is what
we call the habitable zone

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:29.570
and you know fortunately,
earth is indeed

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:32.400
in the habitable zone
so we can live here.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.080
You notice that Venus is a
little bit inside a little closer

00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.090
to the sun than the habitable zone,

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:42.170
and Mars is a little bit
outside of the habitable zone.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:44.350
And that is you know
should be familiar right?

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:49.160 position:56%
We know that Venus is really too hot
to support life and at least today,

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:53.260
Mars seems to be too cold to
support life, although we also know

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:58.030
that in an earlier time it
may have supported life either

00:14:58.030 --> 00:15:00.820
through a thicker atmosphere

00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.470
or a different composition
of the atmosphere.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:07.940 position:56%
So, that's kind of not included
entirely in this, you know it's kind

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:13.170
of an extra dimension to this plot,
but it does go into the calculation

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:17.410
of kind of again the typical
habitable zone for a planet

00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.060
like earth, you have
to include all those,

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:24.380
the atmosphere is actually very
important it's not just what the

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.980
star is doing, but it's what
the atmosphere is doing right?

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:31.770
What we all know very well that the
greenhouse effect makes planets,

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:37.220 position:56%
for example, like Mars much warmer
than they might have otherwise been.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.750
Because the radiation coming
from the star gets absorbed

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.690
by the atmosphere and kind
of trapped and it warms

00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:50.530
up the planet a little bit hotter
than it otherwise would have been.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:58.360
One more thing, we mentioned the
mass of the stars on the left here

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.760
and you see that as
you go to smaller stars

00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:07.000
like I mentioned earlier, the
stars get fainter and cooler.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.070
So you're getting less
radiation from that star,

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:14.790
and therefore the habitable zone
moves closer and closer to the star

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:18.460
because in order to get enough
energy from the star you just have

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:21.150
to move that plant
closer and closer.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:25.260
Now this dotted line here is kind
of another interesting feature

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:27.950
which is what we call
the tidal locking radius.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.640 position:56%
And again, you're probably familiar
with this even if you don't know it.

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.560
Anyone who has ever look at the
moon and noticed the same side

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.780
of the moon always
faces the earth, right.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.440
And the reason is because the
force of the tide between the earth

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:47.070
and the moon has slowed down the
rotating of the moon to the point

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:53.850 position:56%
where it's locked, it rotates at the
same time that it orbits the earth.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.430
And we know that any planets that
are close enough to their stars,

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.890
anything inside this dotted line is
going to have the exact same effect

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:08.910
at the same side of the
planet always facing the star.

00:17:08.910 --> 00:17:12.540
So people say that it means that
a day is the same as a year,

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.020
but that's actually not quite right

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.900
because there's no
such thing as a day.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:19.440
If you're always facing
the sun, you may have year,

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.790
but you don't have a day, it's
kind of odd to think about but.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:25.340
So when you get to
those kind of planets,

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:28.710
actually there's another
important effect right?

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:31.550
That if you're always
facing the same side

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:35.720
of the planet is always facing
the star, well that side is going

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:39.090
to get a lot hotter, the other side
is going to get a whole lot colder.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:43.050
So again we have a situation
where the atmosphere plays a very,

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:46.780
very important role in the
habitability of the planet.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.040
You need to use the
atmosphere essentially

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.050
to move that heat around.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:55.050
And fortunately, you now
on earth it gets cooler,

00:17:55.050 --> 00:18:00.090 position:56%
but the entire planet doesn't freeze
at night because we store up some

00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:05.880
of that warmth in the atmosphere
so those 12 hours of darkness,

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:11.240 position:56%
the atmosphere is cooling down, but
not enough to actually freeze us up.

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:15.440
So, we think the same happens with
these planets down here that are

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.550
so close to their star, like
the ones that we just discovered

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:22.300
with those two-day years,
they're always going

00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:27.790
to be facing the same side
of the planet to the star.

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:33.330
This has an important effect on
the climate too because the clouds.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:37.660
Now imagine some of you have
flown in an airplane before.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.610
You look out the window,
you look down and if any

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.920
of you have every flown over the
ocean, sometimes you look down

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.500 position:56%
and you see the ocean, sometimes you
look down and you see the clouds.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.110
The clouds are white.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:53.660
The ocean is blue, or dark blue.

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:56.140
Right? Well it turns out that
actually makes a really big

00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.660
difference on the weather
and the climate

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:04.510
of the planet is whether you have
clouds, whether you have ocean,

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.010
or whether you have desert,
or whether you have forest.

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:10.750
All of those actually look
very different to the star,

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:12.830
so that light coming
from the star is going

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:16.220
to either just reflect off
the planet if it hits a cloud,

00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:19.270
because clouds are white and
they're really good at reflecting.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:23.440
Or if it hits the ocean it will
be absorbed and turned into heat.

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.610 position:56%
To this group out of the University
of Chicago recently wrote this paper

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:32.220
that showed that you
go from a what we think

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.990
like an earth-like
planet a simplified model

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.090
but an earth-like planet
nonetheless.

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:40.140
This is kind of a map of the globe

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:44.870
where the color is the
fraction of clouds.

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.950
Okay. Sorry.

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:53.750
Just giving me a reminder
to give this talk.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:57.250
So you see at the tropics
around the equator there's a lot

00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:58.550
of clouds right?

00:19:58.550 --> 00:20:00.200
This is where you get
the rainforest.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.040
There's a lot of rain,
there's a lot of clouds.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.480
And then at you know
plus or minus 20,

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:09.390
30 degrees latitude you have these
very dry, desert like regions.

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:14.060
And the reason is because of these
circulation models in the planet

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:19.150
as the moisture rises up at
the equator from getting heated

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:23.650
from the sun and it rises, cools,
turns into clouds and rains.

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:25.500
And you have these
large circulations

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.850
where it's the circulation
model where the air goes up,

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:32.880
moves up to the different
latitudes and then comes

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:40.350
down in what we call Hadley
cells of atmospheric circulation.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.470
And those since they're coming from
way up high where there's not a lot

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:46.170
of moisture, they come
down over the desert,

00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.290
there's no moisture to rain out.

00:20:48.290 --> 00:20:52.450
So that's why the deserts are
dry and the tropics are wet.

00:20:52.450 --> 00:20:57.760
Now because the earth is rotating
relatively fast, once a day,

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.650
these clouds and whether
patterns is going to get just spun

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.800
around the earth and
it all averaged out.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.620
Going from here over to hear,
basically just take the planet

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.360
and stop it, due to
that tidal locking,

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:16.410
where you're always facing the same
side of the planet facing the sun.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.360
You see a completely
different effect.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.700
You have one giant cloud facing the
star because you have this one part

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.820 position:56%
of the planet that's getting heated.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:32.800 position:56%
The water comes up out of the
oceans, goes to the higher altitude,

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:36.590
cools off, forms giant
clouds and rains back down.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.180
You're essentially putting

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:46.360
up a parasol blocking the
planet from any more sunlight.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:51.110 position:56%
And that allows us to go from here,
this amount of energy you're getting

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:57.530
from the sun, which from earth
is 1365 watts per meter squared.

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:01.110
You can more than double the amount
of energy that you're pumping

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:04.160
into the planet and you just
build up a bigger cloud,

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.400
a bigger sun umbrella

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:10.690
and it actually still
remains habitable whereas

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:13.460
if it were rotating, you
wouldn't get that effect

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.910
and you wouldn't be able to
protect yourself from the sun.

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:19.470
So that was basically a
longwinded way of saying

00:22:19.470 --> 00:22:25.810
that when you're tidally locked
to your host star, you can afford

00:22:25.810 --> 00:22:27.700
to get a lot closer to it

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:31.560
and not boil off your oceans
and still be habitable.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:37.890
For basically the rest of the
talk, we're going to condense all

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:41.870
of that information into two
numbers, which is just the amount

00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:48.920
of flux hitting on average you
know some part of the planet,

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:55.330 position:56%
has to be between these two numbers
120 and 750 watts per meter squared.

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:59.460
You don't have to remember those,
just remember that since most

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.980
of the stuff we're going to be
talking about with black holes,

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.960
we're going to be talking about
energy coming from the black hole

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.050
or from these environments
onto the planet.

00:23:08.050 --> 00:23:11.880
And we're going to assume that
somehow the planet finds a way

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:17.340
of converting that energy into your
kind of nice room temperature heat

00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:21.430
and it's going to be able
to do so within this range.

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:24.900
So that's what we're going to
use as our working definition

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.770
of the habitable zone for
the rest of this talk.

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:31.320
Between 120 and 750 watts.

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.360
Okay. Now, we have to figure

00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.990
out what does this have
to do with black holes.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:46.220
I imagine some of you have seen the
movie, some of you may have not.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.900
If you came to the talk you had
to kind of assume you were going

00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.840
to have at least a couple spoilers.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.570
So, here we go.

00:23:52.570 --> 00:23:54.480
Okay so again, remember what
I said at the beginning.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.080
We're not going to pick apart every
little plot hole in the movie,

00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:03.400 position:56%
but basic thing is we got a wormhole
out at Saturn, we're going to go

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.170
through the wormhole
to another galaxy

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:10.510
and explore these three
planets orbiting

00:24:10.510 --> 00:24:13.560
around a black hole
in the other galaxy.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:19.110 position:56%
And look for which one is most
promising to support the human race.

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:22.690 position:56%
Now, some of these may be stretches,

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:28.140
but what I like about this whole
scene and this whole approach is

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:33.680
that it actually very closely
resembles NASA's official policy

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.380
for exoplanet exploration.

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:39.570
No, we don't have an
underground secret facility

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:45.880
that I can tell you about,
but it's essentially this idea

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.180
of triage right.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:52.020
So when you want to explore
a large number of systems

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:56.580
with a limited number of resources
you do this multiple cuts right.

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.970
So for example right
now we're developing

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:01.290
at Goddard this mission
called TESTS,

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:05.720
the Transiting Exoplanets
System Explorer.

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.450
I don't know what the other S
is, second s is for savings.

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:16.330
And it is because the mission
TESTS is a small, very quick,

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:19.840
relatively cheap mission it's
going to go up and just look

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:23.470
for these little shadows of planets
moving in front of the stars.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:27.540
At say the closest
100,000 stars to the earth.

00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:31.240
And it's just going to look at
each one you know for 15 minutes

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.980
and come back and look at
it for 15 minutes again.

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:38.270
And in doing so it will
identify specific targets

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:42.200
that then we're going to use the
next really big mission from NASA,

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.820
the James Webb Space
Telescope is then going

00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.940
to then focus its huge
mirror and spectrograph

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.100
at those planets to
get much better data.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:54.120
Now it can take hundreds and
hundreds of hours of staring

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.500
at a single star to get enough data

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:01.100
to even measure a single absorption
feature in the atmosphere.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.870
So that's why you have to
use something like TESTS

00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:06.990
to find the good candidates
for something

00:26:06.990 --> 00:26:08.970 position:56%
like the James Webb Space Telescope.

00:26:08.970 --> 00:26:12.690
It's really a very reasonable
way to allocate your resources.

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:15.100
And then ultimately as
they show in the movie,

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:21.710
right there's really no substitute
for in situ measurements.

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:24.020
To actually go to the planet,

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.380
get down there take
atmospheric measurements.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:30.710
Take soil samples, which we are
doing in our own solar system,

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:32.610
if not yet other solar systems.

00:26:32.610 --> 00:26:38.580
So that's the basic idea is they
have to explore the properties

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:43.460
of these three planets orbiting
around a supermassive black hole.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:47.400
Now, I'm going to go
through you know the rest

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.700
of the talk we're going to kind

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:53.760
of explore maybe some additional
information they could have used

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.510
in narrowing down their choices

00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:58.920
of which are the most promising
of those three planets.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.390
But at the end of the day,
again we really are limited

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:04.420
by our own imagination right now.

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:08.160
So we're thinking of well what
would an earth-like planet look

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.240
like if you suddenly put it
into orbit around a black hole.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.820
Now, in reality anything orbiting

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:16.410
around a black hole probably is
nothing like an earth-like planet.

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:21.230
Instead of water, you know they
might have liquid lead oceans and

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:23.620
yet still be perfectly comfortable

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:26.980
for whatever creatures they have
there, but at least from the point

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:30.310
of view of trying to look
for an earth type planet

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:33.760
around a super massive black
hole, we'll use what we know

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.030
about earth climate and the type

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:41.510
of habitability defined
by the liquid water.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:45.180
So, remember this plot,
with that little dotted line

00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.230
about tidally locked planets.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:52.620
So now I scaled up the mass
instead of the star, now it's going

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.870
to be the mass of the black hole
that this planet is orbiting.

00:27:55.870 --> 00:27:57.760
So you see these are now,

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:01.620
again anyone who's not
entirely comfortable

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:06.050 position:56%
with scientific notation 10 to the
8th that's how you read that number,

00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:10.750
10 to the 8, or simply
1 followed by 8 zeroes.

00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:14.400
So a hundred million
times the size of the sun,

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.810 position:56%
that's kind of the prototypical size

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.400
of what we call a super massive
black hole and as Kip outlines

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:27.870
in his book, that's really
the target mass he had in mind

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:30.480
for Gargantua, the
black hole in the movie.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.910
So that's really the
number we're thinking about,

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:35.900
which means that any planet

00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:40.790
within about 200 astronomical
units would all be tidally locked.

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:44.670
The gravity is so strong, it would
essentially block the entire solar

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:51.520
system as we know it, would be
locked into that rotational fixing

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.740
so that it's always going
to face the same side.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.200
The same side is going
to face the black hole.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:01.230
So I think we're pretty safe
in using that assumption

00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:05.270
of that potential huge cloud
deck to help protect us

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:07.380
from excessive radiation.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:11.210
So it's a good time to introduce,

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:16.890
I think this may be the only
equation in the entire talk.

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:20.600
Which is something called a
gravitational radius, right.

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.960
It's also a unit of light
and conveniently enough

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:30.140
for 100 million solar
mass black hole,

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:34.560
one gravitational radius is exactly
the same as one astronomical unit.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:39.220 position:56%
So you don't even really have to
think of any new units or equations.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:44.900
So this is simply the Newton's
gravitational constant times the

00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:49.440
mass of the black hole divided
by the speed of light squared.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:53.650
Another convenient
feature of this equation is

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:59.060
that for most black holes, this
is the size of the black hole

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.040
in that this is the radius
of the event horizon.

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:07.180
So down here at one gravitational
radius is the event horizon.

00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:10.120 position:56%
Out here at 100 gravitational radii,

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:14.320
that's essentially 100 times
further away from the black hole.

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:17.100
So these are the units that
we're going to use for the rest

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:22.830
of the talk, all scaled in
as a fraction of the size

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:26.750
of the black hole, as a
fraction of the event horizon.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:31.390
And again, pretty much everything
we're going to be looking

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:35.410
at is going to be inside of
that tidal locking radius.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:40.480
So we got the mass, we
got the tidally locked,

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.920
now we have to figure out
how to replace this axis

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.220
with what we had before

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:49.110
for the stars was how much
energy are you actually getting

00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:50.410
out of the black hole, right?

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:51.710
Black holes are black.

00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:53.010
Well, not exactly.

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:55.330
Right? Black holes are actually
really, really, really bright.

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:59.040
And the reason is because most
black holes that we can see

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:04.660 position:56%
that we can measure, of course a
strong selection of them is the ones

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:08.140
that are bright, the ones that
have gas orbiting around them

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:10.130
in something called
an accretion disc.

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:17.070 position:56%
So here's a little artist impression
of gas going around the black hole.

00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:20.220
You see that basically it
looks like a planetary system.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:25.430
Everything's going around nice
flat plain on nice circular orbits.

00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:29.050
And you can kind of see from,
again the artist impression

00:31:29.050 --> 00:31:32.750
that the accretion disk
gets brighter and brighter

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:34.470 position:56%
as it gets closer to the black hole.

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:39.510
The gas as it gets pulled into
the black hole gets heated up,

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:40.810
hotter and hotter.

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:42.660
So it becomes brighter
and brighter just

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:46.180
like hotter stars are
brighter than cooler stars.

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:52.010
So this is the artist impression
here is the astrophysicist

00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:55.840
impression, and the more or less
the same picture that they moved

00:31:55.840 --> 00:32:02.930
in the movie promotion, this is
the one that I made on my computer.

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:07.770
Here's the turbulent gas
moving around on these orbits

00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:12.330
in the accretion disk
around the black hole.

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:15.960
We're looking at the
accretion disk almost edge on.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.690
So it should look like a
flatten pancake but because

00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:21.520
of the super strong gravity

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.750
of the black hole the
light actually gets warped

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.190
by what we call gravitational
lensing.

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:31.660
So this huge arc in the back
is actually we zoom in here,

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:35.720
it's actually photon's light from
the far side of the black hole.

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:38.510
It gets bent by the
black hole's gravity

00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:41.180
up into this arc above and below.

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:45.860
You also see the light
coming, gets bent from below.

00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.970
This inner circle here
is even cooler.

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:51.090
Because this is light that goes

00:32:51.090 --> 00:32:53.700
around the black hole
the entire time,

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:58.210 position:56%
and then hits the accretion disk and
then escapes out to the observer.

00:32:58.210 --> 00:33:02.290
So you see these characteristic
light rings around the black hole

00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:06.080
and that's due to the
extreme gravitational warping

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.140 position:56%
of space time around the black hole.

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:15.990
Here is a plot of again, another
one of these log log plots.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:18.640
Now, we're plotting
the distance from,

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:21.690
this is essentially the
distance from the horizon.

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:23.900
The distance from the
edge of the black hole.

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:27.880
So we can get very, very close
to the black hole a hundredth

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:30.980
of a gravitational radius
away from the horizon.

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:35.770
And on the Y-axis this is a
temperature of an accretion disk.

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:39.710
So you see that the accretion
disk as it goes closer and closer

00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:41.840
to the black hole, it
gets hotter and hotter.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.230
But then it turns over
and goes down to zero.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:47.140
All these different
curves have to do

00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:49.250
with different black
hole spins right.

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:53.690
Just like planets spin, stars spin,
we believe that black holes spin.

00:33:53.690 --> 00:34:00.090
But when a black hole spins, when
it rotates, it drags the fabric

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:02.230
of space time along with it.

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:04.870
Pulling everything
along in its wake.

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:07.930
So this gas can get
closer, and closer,

00:34:07.930 --> 00:34:11.220
and closer without falling
into the black hole yet.

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:14.730
This blue curve here is for a
black hole that doesn't spin,

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:17.310
the gas goes in, it
gets to a certain point

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:19.680
and then just plunges
down the drain.

00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:24.120 position:56%
As you go to higher and higher spins
the gas gets closer, and closer,

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:25.420
and closer to the back hole.

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:29.550
It gets hotter, and hotter, closer
and closer to the event horizon.

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:34.690
And we measure this spin basically
is just a number between 0 and 1.

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:38.060
Zero is no spin, one
is the maximum allowed

00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:41.220
by Einstein's Theory of Relativity.

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:47.120
So up here is a maximally spinning
black hole and that the Gargantua

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:51.920
in the movie is also considered to
be just about maximally spinning

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:57.510 position:56%
and you see, so the temperature goes
up, actually almost 200,000 degrees

00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:01.370
of the accretion disk as
it gets a heated up just

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:03.360
about to fall into the black hole.

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:10.720
Now our sun is about 5700 degrees.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:14.690
Let's call it 6000 degrees,
now that's in Kelvin,

00:35:14.690 --> 00:35:17.880
or Centigrade just about the same.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:22.450
So our sun, which is very far away

00:35:22.450 --> 00:35:26.450
at 6000 degrees is
enough to keep us warm.

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:27.750
So what do you think it would be

00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:30.250
like if you were right
outside the event horizon

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:34.250
with an accretion disk
surrounding you 200,000 degrees.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:37.640
Well, your planet would
be then 200,000 degrees.

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.440
A little bit too hot
to support life.

00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:45.050 position:56%
So what we need to do is essentially
dial that temperature way

00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:47.730
down to the few hundreds degrees.

00:35:47.730 --> 00:35:51.470
Room temperature let's
say is 300 degrees Kelvin.

00:35:51.470 --> 00:35:53.080
So we want to dial this temperature

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:57.290
down from 200,000 degrees
to 300 degrees.

00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:59.590
There actually is a very
simple way to do that.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:03.670
If you just dial down the amount
of gas in the accretion disk.

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:09.990 position:56%
If you put less gas piling into the
black hole, it essentially cools off

00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:14.190
because there's less energy
to turn into radiation.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:17.950
So we're just going to
dial that accretion rate,

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:20.650
that gas way down until
we get something

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:24.100
that is a little bit more habitable

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:27.130
and looks a little
bit more like the sun.

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:30.620
So there's Miller's Planet is
the one that's orbiting very,

00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:33.140
very close to Gargantua.

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:40.970 position:56%
And you saw from the visuals,
right, let's take a, it's Hollywood,

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:46.590 position:56%
but if you wanted to really pull the
umm actually approach to this movie,

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:51.750
right you see that it looks
kind of like the sun, right?

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:55.970
It's yellowish, white, you know
we can see it with our eyes.

00:36:55.970 --> 00:37:01.330
If it were 200,000 degrees it would
be blasting us with UV radiation,

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:04.630
but it looks more or less like
the sun in all the visuals.

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:08.170
So you know Kip talks about it in
the book and we're going to infer

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:13.430
from that that the temperature of
the accretion disk is comparable

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:17.910
to the temperature of the
sun, say 5 or 6000 degrees.

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:22.220
So, in order to do that
what you need to do is dial

00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:29.230
that accretion rate way down
from, let's call it one.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:31.920
Unit of one is kind of the
maximum accretion rate.

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:39.040
Down to 10 to the 12 times less
accretion rate is what you need

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:44.160
to get the temperature down to
where a planet could be habitable.

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:48.160 position:56%
So the way that you read this kind
of graph is there's kind of two ways

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:54.610 position:56%
to do it you could say, well let's
say the accretion rate is 10 billion

00:37:54.610 --> 00:37:59.630
times less than maximum, then
where's the habitable zone you have

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:02.090
to go out here and you see
the habitable zone is right

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:05.710
around 10 gravitational radii.

00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:09.270
To get down to the
temperature of the sun,

00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:13.550
it turns out you need an accretion
rate of 10 to the minus 7 so that's

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:17.990
up here, and the habitable
zone would be out here

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:21.470
at about 100 gravitational radii.

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:26.680
So, we're not critiquing
but we're exploring right?

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:32.420
Miller's Planet is down here,
right outside of the black hole.

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:38.200
It is so far inside of the
habitable zone that the temperature

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:43.010
on the planet would essentially be
thousands and thousands of degrees.

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:46.130
Which if you can see the accretion
disk you would have already

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:48.810
known that.

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:53.570
So the only, you know if the
accretion disk looks like the sun,

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:57.270
way up here, then you only want to
look for planets that are out in

00:38:57.270 --> 00:39:02.450
that habitable zone, hundreds
of gravitational radii away.

00:39:02.450 --> 00:39:06.170
This is well we can skip
this is just a slight detail.

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:10.840
The problem is the only way
that you could actually dial

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:16.430
that accretion rate down
to these temperatures,

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:22.900
it turns out that the disk would
be so thin, the amount of gas

00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.390 position:56%
in the disk would be so little, it
would cease to be a disk altogether.

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:31.190
In fact, that's exactly what we
see of the black hole in the center

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:35.350
of our own galaxy, Sagittarius A
star is a super massive black hole

00:39:35.350 --> 00:39:37.080
in the center of the Milky Way

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.550
and it looks nothing
at all like Gargantua.

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:41.580
It doesn't have an accretion disk.

00:39:41.580 --> 00:39:44.890
It doesn't have this nice
increasing temperature.

00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:48.340
It's just has a big blob
of hot gas that we can see

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:51.990
with the Chandra x-ray telescope.

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:55.540
And it's very low density,
but very hot gas.

00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:58.190
Just kind of freefalling
onto the black hole.

00:39:58.190 --> 00:40:02.050 position:56%
You don't see these nice thin disks.

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:07.290
So, okay so let's get rid of the
accretion disk picture altogether

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:11.040
and now we'll say but the heat
source is coming from this gas,

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.070
just kind of freefalling
onto the black hole.

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:16.550
Now the problem is
the planet's going

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:19.550
on a nice circular orbit
around the black hole.

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:22.160
So if you're in an accretion
disk, you're going along

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.220
with the accretion disk on
these nice circular orbits

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.880
and you know all that
matters is the light

00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:29.300
that you're getting
from the accretion disk.

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:32.850
But if you're going on a circular
orbit around the black hole,

00:40:32.850 --> 00:40:36.640
and all this gas around you
is just freefalling down,

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:37.940
what's going to happen?

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:39.580
You're actually going
to smash into the gas

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:41.970
because this one's going this
way, you're going that way

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:44.790
and you smash into the gas.

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:48.280
And gas falling into a black
hole as it gets closer and closer

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.700
to the black hole goes
faster and faster

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:52.880
until essentially it's
going the speed of light.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.190
So you're going to have this
planet getting sandblasted

00:40:56.190 --> 00:41:01.050
by the surrounding gas hitting
it at nearly the speed of light.

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:05.240 position:56%
But, okay we can do that remember we
said we assume the atmosphere had a

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.770
way of recirculating the energy.

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:09.830
All we care about is
what's the total amount

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:13.710
of energy getting absorbed
by the planet.

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:15.620
Well, this is what it looks like.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:19.290 position:56%
You just have to dial that accretion
rate way, way, way, way down.

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:22.310
Because again, as you get closer
and closer to the black hole

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:27.070
that gas falling in is going faster
and faster so you just have to dial

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:30.620
down the accretion rate, you get
less and less gas going faster

00:41:30.620 --> 00:41:36.540
and faster and that's the that
gives you the amount of gas

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:39.290
that would still allow the
planet to be habitable.

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:41.450
Essentially off the charts.

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:45.570 position:56%
Okay so let's assume that since
they were able to build a worm hold,

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:51.070 position:56%
this advanced civilization has found
a way to get rid of all that gas

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:54.340
around the black hole to
kind of solve it entirely

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:55.920
from destroying the planet.

00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:00.870
Well, there's yet another
problem we have to worry about.

00:42:00.870 --> 00:42:03.650
Okay so this is essentially,

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:07.510
I would say the most important
point of the entire talk.

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:11.390
Because it's the one thing
that I came up with that's not

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:18.280
in the Kip Thorne book, right,
it's this plot right here.

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:25.350
Right? As you get closer and closer
to the black hole time slows down,

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:27.800 position:56%
right we all know that Einstein says

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.740
that gravity can warp
space and time.

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.120
So as you get closer and
closer to the black hole,

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:38.230
like Rombley just said, you
know relativity tells us

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:39.530
that time slows down.

00:42:39.530 --> 00:42:44.430
So he also says that one hour
is equal to seven years, right.

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:49.290
That's one hour is equal to
60,000 hours in seven years.

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:52.820
So you have this time
dilation effect of a factor

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:56.350
of 60,000 right that's
way over here.

00:42:56.350 --> 00:43:00.520
So to get that effect you
are essentially forced

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:06.380
to put Miller's Planet so
close to the event horizon,

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:12.630
you know 0.00004 gravitational
radii away from the event horizon

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:17.860
that in order to get that
extreme time dilation effect.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:22.330
So, okay let's you know,
let's work with this.

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:27.310
What then happens when you
want to say talk on the radio,

00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:29.170
right you're going on
your little landing ship

00:43:29.170 --> 00:43:33.040
down onto the planet you left
the mothership behind far away.

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.190
You're talking back
and forth on the radio.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:40.460
Or let's say you're doing Morris
Code with a laser pointer, right.

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:46.070
So I'm let's say I'm on the
planet right and I'm talking back

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:52.920 position:56%
to the ship and I'm sending a little
blip every second, except that blip

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.180
from the point of view
of the ship far away

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:57.010
from the planet is only going

00:43:57.010 --> 00:44:01.660
to get one blip every
60,000 seconds, right.

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:03.420
Let's turn it around the other way.

00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:07.420
Let's say you're on the ship
sending little Morris code

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:10.820
to people on the planet.

00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:12.980
You're sending a little
blip every second,

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.800
they're getting 60,000
blips a second.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.850
You know right on top
of their heads.

00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:23.900
And if it's a laser pointer,
there's a much bigger problem,

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.630
right that a laser,
right what is a laser,

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:32.320
it's a perfectly coherent
wave radio wave,

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.440
or you know electromagnetic wave

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.870
that has exact perfectly
consistent frequency.

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:43.700
The frequency of a laser is
actually just like a clock.

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:49.860
So this laser is actually hitting
the screen just like Morris code,

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:52.930
but hitting it you know
10 the 15 times per second

00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:56.770
with a little you know photon wave.

00:44:56.770 --> 00:45:01.580
Now you multiply that, also has
to get multiplied by 60,000.

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:04.960
So from the point of view of a
laser that's what we call red shift

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.260
or blue shift.

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:12.100
So now instead of a laser
hitting the people on the planet,

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:15.270
you're essentially hitting
them with an x-ray death beam.

00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:21.760
Okay? So, and that's all
completely inseparable

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:25.080
from this idea of time dilation.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:28.470
If you're going to have that
factor of 60,000 times dilation

00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:31.820
and Christopher Nolan absolutely
demanded it for the plot right.

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:35.350
He told Kip, he said,
nope that's nonnegotiable.

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:39.390
Then you're going to have
also all the radiation hitting

00:45:39.390 --> 00:45:43.740
that planet is going to be
60,000 times more energetic

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.980
than it was admitted by.

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:47.820
Okay let's work with this,

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:50.450
just don't shine a laser
pointer on the guys, okay?

00:45:50.450 --> 00:45:52.390
Right. Problem solved.

00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:57.370
No. Well turns out the entire
universe is a giant laser pointer,

00:45:57.370 --> 00:45:58.670
right?

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:00.120
Has anybody ever seen this picture?

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:03.670
This is the cosmic
Microwave background, very,

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:09.620
very low frequency radio waves
that permeate the entire universe.

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:12.820
Right? And it's got these little
fluctuations because some spots

00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:14.870
in the sky are a little
warmer than others,

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:19.530
but you basically have an entire
sky of radio waves at very,

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:23.960
very low temperature, two
degrees above absolute zero.

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:27.100
Well let's see what this would
look like to the point of view

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:30.350
of a planet or a spaceship
orbiting a black hole.

00:46:30.350 --> 00:46:34.030 position:56%
As you get closer to the black hole,
okay so there's the black hole,

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:36.590
there's the gravitational lensing.

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:41.550 position:56%
But now you're seeing like asymmetry
between the front and the back.

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:44.910
And this is a, I have
to kind of step away

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:49.020
from the mic here this is
[inaudible] all skied out.

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:53.360
So picture yourself on the space
station, on a spaceship like this

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:56.740
where the black hole is
on your left and in front

00:46:56.740 --> 00:47:02.390
of you is this area here, and to
your right, projected this area,

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:04.480
this area here is behind you,

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:08.480
right that's how this kind
of, this projection works.

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:12.300
As you get closer and closer to the
black hole, you're moving faster

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:15.090
and faster orbiting around it.

00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:17.450
The black hole shadow
gets bigger right.

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:19.970
Now we're at 5 gravitational radii.

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:25.550 position:56%
And this patch of radiation in front
of you is getting hotter and hotter.

00:47:25.550 --> 00:47:29.400
Now it's up to a whopping 4
degrees above absolute zero.

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:33.250
Get even closer the black
hole essentially takes up half

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:37.600 position:56%
of the sky, right, the black hole is
that entire area to the left of you

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:42.780
and right in front of you is all
of the entire cosmic radiation

00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:47.210
of the universe squeezed into
a single point and hitting you

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:51.380
at a blue shifted frequency.

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:55.040
Now frequency and temperature
are actually the same thing.

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:58.920
So as we go zooming closer,
and closer, and closer,

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:00.640
now we're up to 15 degrees.

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:03.770
But if you get to the point
where your time dilation,

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:07.590
your blue shift is
a factor of 60,000,

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:12.580
you get the background radiation
temperature goes from 2 degrees

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:17.060
to 120,000 degrees, beaming
at you right in the face

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:20.220
with this huge ultraviolet flux.

00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:24.450 position:56%
Again, not so good for habitability.

00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:28.480
So here's the plot you know
as you get closer and closer

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:32.890
to the black hole, here's just
the total flux that you're getting

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:35.420
from the CMB coming at you

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:38.180
and here's the little
band of habitability.

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:42.540
So Miller's Planet is way up
here, about 100 times more flux

00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:45.330
than you could possibly
survive and that's just

00:48:45.330 --> 00:48:48.080
from the cosmic microwave
background.

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:52.450
But, okay so you back it away a
little bit and you're good to go.

00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:54.750
Well, not quite right.

00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:58.060
There's a picture of the
center of our galaxy,

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:01.710
well it turns out that also in the
center galaxy in addition to all

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:04.470
that gas, there are a lot of stars.

00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:07.320
In fact, if you were to live
in the center of the Milky Way,

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:10.910
the night sky would be
100,000 times brighter.

00:49:10.910 --> 00:49:13.820
You could read at night from
starlight, just because there's

00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:17.560
so many more stars packed
into a small region.

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:18.860
So now instead of just worrying

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:23.150
about the cosmic microwave
background you have all these stars

00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:25.320
just everywhere surrounding you,

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:28.630
all getting blue shifted
and raining down on you.

00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:32.460
So that gives you the flux from the
starlight is actually much higher.

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:35.440
So you have to push your
planet even further away

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:38.650
from the black hole
to still survive.

00:49:38.650 --> 00:49:42.980
Okay we got very advanced
civilization,

00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:46.830
we'll just build a giant Dyson
sphere around the planet,

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:49.830
which is another famous
idea in science fiction

00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:53.650
where you essentially build a
giant metal sphere around a star

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:58.430
or a planet that can either absorb
light or reflect all of the light.

00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:03.560 position:56%
Okay so all of that cosmic radiation
coming inform outside getting blue

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:06.950
shifted from the black hole, we'll
just build like a giant mirror,

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:09.490
disco ball and just reflect it out

00:50:09.490 --> 00:50:14.040
and out planet will nestle
inside nice, safe, and sound.

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:15.440
Neutrinos.

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:18.020
Could go through anything.

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:20.750
They can, you know 10 billion
just went through my thumb nail.

00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:22.050
They're everywhere.

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:25.130
Now, fortunately for us neutrinos
basically could just care less

00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:27.300
about us, they just
zip right through us.

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:30.890
But if you get enough of them
they start to deposit energy.

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:34.490
And just like there's the
cosmic microwave background,

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:36.800
there's also a cosmic
neutrino background.

00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:40.030
The universe is just
filled with neutrinos.

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:42.670
But because they more or
less go right through you,

00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:47.850
you have to get really close, let's
say 10 to the minus 11 radii away

00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:52.160
from the horizon to get
enough neutrino flux lighting

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:57.640
up the atmosphere, in order
to get that habitability zone.

00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:02.330 position:56%
But, let's say the neutrinos don't
just get absorbed in the atmosphere,

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:05.120
the neutrinos could also get
absorbed in the core of the earth,

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:08.590
the core of the planet and
then heated up radiation

00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:12.370
and then essentially you have
geothermal heating of the planet

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:15.910
from neutrinos, yes NASA
does actually pay me to think

00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:18.180
about these things, right?

00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:22.420
And that moves it way out because
you get a lot more cross section,

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:25.740
a lot more opportunities to
get heated by the neutrinos.

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:28.830
And then we can actually
push it out even further

00:51:28.830 --> 00:51:34.540
because these are the
C neutrino background,

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:35.950
the cosmic neutrino background.

00:51:35.950 --> 00:51:37.920
And it turns out actually
most of the neutrinos going

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:41.380
through me right now are not
coming from the distant universe,

00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:42.880
but they're coming from the sun.

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.700
right the sun generating
neutrinos in its core

00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:48.440
and its core nuclear
reactor all the time.

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:52.670
So when you use those neutrinos
instead it actually goes much,

00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:56.860 position:56%
there's a lot more flux, you have
to push it way out and then you have

00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:01.510
to push it out even further because
remember now we're in the center

00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:04.950
of the galaxy where there are
tons of stars, tons of neutrinos

00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:09.450 position:56%
and you're pushed out so far, you're
basically out to the same radius

00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:13.350
that you were for the cosmic
microwave background radiation.

00:52:13.350 --> 00:52:17.860
So even with your Dyson sphere, the
neutrinos are still going to heat

00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:23.340
up your planet above
any habitability zone.

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:27.870 position:56%
Let's say again, we've got super
advanced civilization we can build a

00:52:27.870 --> 00:52:31.340
Dyson sphere we can even
build a neutrino Dyson sphere.

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:35.170
Just you know a kilometer of
lead around the entire planet

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:39.350
to protect it from neutrinos.

00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:42.260
There's dark matter.

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:43.560
I just like this movie.

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:47.110
It's a movie I made a simulation

00:52:47.110 --> 00:52:51.120
of dark matter particles
orbiting around a black hole.

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:53.830
And there's just dark matter
everywhere in the universe

00:52:53.830 --> 00:52:57.950
and we don't know anything about it
except that it reacts to gravity.

00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:01.330
And we know that black holes have
a whole heck of a lot of gravity.

00:53:01.330 --> 00:53:04.420
So we know that dark matter
is going to all get pulled

00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:08.000
in toward black holes and when
it's a spinning black hold

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.580
like Gargantua, it actually
wraps the dark matter around it

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:16.260
and it almost looks like a ball of
yarn as these particles get pulled

00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:21.950
around the black hole from the
twisting and warping of space time.

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:25.600
And that, you put a planet
down in the middle of that

00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:29.720 position:56%
and you're just going to get
completely bombarded by dark matter.

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:31.680
Now, since we don't
actually know anything

00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:34.170
about dark matter I
couldn't make a plot

00:53:34.170 --> 00:53:37.880
because I don't know actually how
dark matter will affect the planet,

00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:42.590
but I imagine it's going to be bad.

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:47.940
This is our last source of death
on a planet around a black hole.

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:49.510
Gravitational waves, right?

00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:55.700
Today, like we said celebrated with
$3 million, Kip Thorne's discovery

00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:57.390
of gravitational waves with Ligo.

00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:59.890
I don't know if any of
you have seen this movie,

00:53:59.890 --> 00:54:05.490
this is from the press conference
at NSF earlier this year.

00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:12.820
Those are two different filters
on the gravitational wave.

00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:14.430
That was it.

00:54:14.430 --> 00:54:16.090
That little zip.

00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:22.350
That was three times the size of
the sun, e=mc squared being turned

00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:26.190
into pure energy in
about 20 milliseconds.

00:54:26.190 --> 00:54:27.490
All right?

00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:30.730
You're going to have
the exact same effects.

00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:34.860
And all of these other
time dilation blue shifts.

00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:37.710
You have a universe filled
with gravitational waves,

00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:39.900
and they're all going to
be hitting your planet

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:41.540
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:44.960
When you get closer and
closer to the black hole,

00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.660
those gravitational waves are just
going to get amplified to higher

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:50.240
and higher amplitude, higher

00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:53.440
and higher frequency
and bombard your planet.

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:59.040
Unfortunately, this is why it
took 100 years to detect them,

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.210
even worse than neutrinos really,

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:03.320
they really just fly
through everything.

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:08.700
So you're going to have to get
almost so, well really so close

00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:13.240
to that black hole that basically
all other bets are off in order

00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:17.370
for the gravitational waves to
have any real effect on you.

00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:21.440
So we're going to leave
gravitational waves,

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:27.480
and I see the Einstein's Outrageous
Legacy, that's the sub title

00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:29.390
of this book that we
mentioned before right?

00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:32.550
"Black Holes and Time Warps,"
Einstein's Outrageous Legacy.

00:55:32.550 --> 00:55:36.890
Einstein predicted both black
holes and gravitational waves.

00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:38.190
And we're going to leave it

00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:41.390
by saying those gravitational
waves might be the only thing

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:44.660
that won't kill you around a
black hole, which I think is kind

00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:49.900
of a nice poetic, you
know consistency

00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:51.650
within Einstein's theory.

00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:54.730
Here are all the things
that will kill you right?

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:57.160
We talked about the accretion
disk, the sand blasted

00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:02.200 position:56%
by an accretion cloud, the cosmic
microwave background, the starlight,

00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:05.530
the neutrinos, dark
matter, and maybe

00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:08.160
or maybe not surrounding
gravitational waves.

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:11.210
But we want to end on
a more positive note,

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:14.660
so instead of thinking these things
can kill you all right these are

00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:17.990
nine ways that a black hole can
keep you warm at night and look

00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:23.400
for a nice comfy place to
relocate the human race

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:25.080
after we've destroyed earth.

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:28.500
To through the wormhole
to Gargantuan and settle

00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:32.020
down in a nice planet,
comfortably in the habitable zone

00:56:32.020 --> 00:56:34.080
around a super massive black hole.

00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:35.880
Thank you very much.

00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:44.610
[ Applause ]

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:48.190
&gt;&gt; Michelle Cadoree Bradley: Oh,
that was so absolutely wonderful.

00:56:48.190 --> 00:56:50.610
I do know that tonight
I'll be going home

00:56:50.610 --> 00:56:53.630
and treating our earth
just a little bit better

00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:55.480 position:56%
because I don't think we'll be going

00:56:55.480 --> 00:57:00.080
and finding any other place
to go to any time soon.

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:06.180 position:56%
So we'd like to again thank Dr.
Schnittman for coming with us today.

00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:08.510
Let's just give.

00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:13.540
[ Applause ]

00:57:13.540 --> 00:57:16.320
And we can begin our
question and answer period.

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:19.170
And we'll ask you to
repeat their questions

00:57:19.170 --> 00:57:20.580
for the purpose of our webcast.

00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:23.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Schnittman: And actually
I've put up the last slide for those

00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:25.850
who haven't seen the movie,
or more importantly the people

00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:29.250
who have seen the movie, but maybe
were confused about a thing or two,

00:57:29.250 --> 00:57:30.850
this should clarify everything.

00:57:30.850 --> 00:57:33.150
Yeah.

00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:39.470
&gt;&gt; So you're assuming in the
talk where orbiting something

00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:42.120
around a black hole is
circular or elliptical

00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:46.380
but it doesn't move forward, but we
know that the gravitational effect

00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:47.860
on the black hole is
going to pull that planet,

00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:50.490
exoplanet whatever
eventually toward it.

00:57:50.490 --> 00:57:52.290
What's that timeframe like?

00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:56.110
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Schnittman: Right, so the
question was what's the timescale

00:57:56.110 --> 00:58:01.620
like for the planet to actually
get pulled into the black hole

00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:04.180
as it spirals in through its orbit.

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:08.220
So it's actually pretty
similar to that of planets

00:58:08.220 --> 00:58:09.990
in our solar system, right?

00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:15.550
We go around the sun on
circular or elliptical orbits

00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:18.750
and we're constantly getting
pulled in toward the sun,

00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:22.210
but we actually don't get really
any closer to the sun and that's

00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:26.360
because we have angular
momentum right.

00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:28.410
And sometime you may learn about it

00:58:28.410 --> 00:58:31.000
in physics classes,
centrifugal force.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:34.450
You kind of want to go out, the
sun's pulling you in and you end

00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:36.790
up on this nice stable orbit.

00:58:36.790 --> 00:58:40.100
The one difference with the black
hole is you also have gravitational

00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:45.200
waves, which is essentially
a drag force on the planet.

00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:48.670
But unless you yourself
are also a black hole,

00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:50.820
that little planet is basically,

00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:53.580
think of it as leaving
a wake, right.

00:58:53.580 --> 00:58:58.170 position:56%
So a big boat leaves this huge wage
and there's a lot of drag on a boat.

00:58:58.170 --> 00:59:01.090
But you know a water
bug basically just skims

00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:03.540
across the surface of the water.

00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:05.890
So these little planets
that are much, much, much,

00:59:05.890 --> 00:59:09.590
much smaller than the black hole
are just like water bugs skimming

00:59:09.590 --> 00:59:14.330
around the surface of space time
without really any losses of all.

00:59:14.330 --> 00:59:19.810
The bigger problem, again is
due to that time dilation right.

00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:21.900
Factor of 60,000.

00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:25.430 position:56%
That planet, even if that planet
was kind of created at the beginning

00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:28.860
of the universe and put next
to that black hole by hand,

00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:33.140
essentially you take the
entire age of the universe,

00:59:33.140 --> 00:59:37.770
say 13 billion years,
divided by 60,000

00:59:37.770 --> 00:59:42.770
and the planet could really only
be 200,000 years old from its point

00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:46.790
of view, right, the clock on the
planet is only 200,000 years old.

00:59:46.790 --> 00:59:50.390
So that's actually another way that
it would probably be inhabitable

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:53.090
because it takes a while
for a planet to really set

00:59:53.090 --> 00:59:55.480
into a nice equilibrium
before you want to live

00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:59.640
on it otherwise it would just
be covered with molt and rock.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:03.500
Anyone else?

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.300
Yeah?

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:22.040
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:25.690
Well, the question is why isn't
everything just pulled straight

01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:26.990
into a black hole.

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:32.490
And the answer is angular
momentum right?

01:00:32.490 --> 01:00:38.090
The famous example of angular
momentum is the ice skater, right?

01:00:38.090 --> 01:00:39.940
They're spinning around
with their arms out,

01:00:39.940 --> 01:00:42.370
they pull the arms in
and they go faster.

01:00:42.370 --> 01:00:46.410
But if you've ever tried that
trick, you actually feel that pull,

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:48.860
it wants to pull your
arms back out again.

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:52.380
So the same with the planet, as it
gets closer, it's spinning around

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:55.830
but it has that centrifugal
force making it feel

01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:58.320
like it's trying to
pull back out again.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:01.720
And it's the gravity that's
pulling it in and it just balances.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.640
And except when you're very,

01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:08.790 position:56%
very close to the black hole they're
basically like Newtonian gravity.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:11.190
So it's going to look just
like the planet's going

01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:13.430
around the sun in the solar system.

01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:15.840
We did talk about for the
non-spinning black hole is there

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:19.010
anything that's not spinning
at the maximum level.

01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:20.810
You do get to a certain
point and it's very,

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:22.110
very close to the black hole.

01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:24.590
You get to a certain point
where you do just fall in.

01:01:24.590 --> 01:01:28.470
And that's very much a
relativity predication.

01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:31.770
Newtonian, you just get closer, and
closer, as close as you want to get

01:01:31.770 --> 01:01:34.990
to an infinitely small point.

01:01:34.990 --> 01:01:39.290
But in general relativity,
there's this special point beyond

01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:42.290
which you just are going to
always just plunge right in,

01:01:42.290 --> 01:01:44.380
but it's very close
to the black hole.

01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:46.510
Yeah?

01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:59.130
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:03.200
Right. So the question is what's
the scaling, the relation of energy

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:06.010
to distance from the black hole.

01:02:06.010 --> 01:02:10.020
So if you're far enough away that
it just looks like a bright spot

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:13.980
in the sky, then it's going to
again, behave just like the sun.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:18.170
the flux of energy goes like
one over the distance squared.

01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:22.070
But in some of the ideas
that we were showing here

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:25.240
where you're actually in the
accretion disk or you're surrounded

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:29.550
by this hot matter, then it's
going to be more complicated.

01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:33.800
You know you're essentially
depends on how that temperature

01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:38.690
in the accretion disk changes
as a function of distance.

01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:42.870
So accretion disk, the temperature
typically goes up like one

01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:46.210
over the distance or something
close to that, but then it turns

01:02:46.210 --> 01:02:47.510
over and falls off again.

01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:51.240
So it's not a simple relation,
unless you're far enough away

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:53.510
that it all look Newtonian.

01:02:53.510 --> 01:03:08.230
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:12.790
I mean I've seen press
releases from Stephen Hawking

01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:17.210
which unfortunately is his primary
form of communication these days.

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:19.870
So from a scientific point
of view, it's sometimes hard

01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:24.160
to evaluate the details
of a press release.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.820
From what I understand though,

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:31.890
I mean his whole career has
really focused on the effects

01:03:31.890 --> 01:03:36.390
of quantum mechanics very close
to the horizon of a black hole.

01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:41.450
Information theory, where does
quantum uncertainty go how does it

01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:44.600
behave on the horizon.

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:48.280
And I've actually, every
single effect that I've talked

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:53.760
about today is purely classical,
non-quantum effects involved here.

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:58.250
And that's basically, my research
is very much a classical research.

01:03:58.250 --> 01:04:02.720 position:56%
So even if Stephen Hawking did write
a paper I'm probably not the one

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:05.140
to evaluate it.

01:04:06.740 --> 01:04:08.540
Yeah?

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:40.040
[ Inaudible Audience Question ]

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:43.510
Right. So we do measure
the total mass

01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:45.950
in dark matter throughout
the universe.

01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:47.910
That's how we know it exists right?

01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:50.960
We see how it effects,
because it effects gravity.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:55.660
So all we have to do is look
it orbits around massive things

01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:58.200
like galaxies and clusters
of galaxies

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.260 position:56%
and you can actually see the things.

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:02.120
Everything is moving
faster than it should.

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:03.820
So you can essentially
work backwards

01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:06.220
and say oh there must be
more stuff there and that's

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:09.910
where the whole idea of
dark matter came from.

01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:14.490
When it comes to looking at
something like the solar system,

01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:21.510
or in this case a black hole, when
you get down to those small scales,

01:05:21.510 --> 01:05:25.990
the whole gravity is dominated
so much by the black hole,

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:28.350
or by the sun, that it's very,

01:05:28.350 --> 01:05:33.270
very hard to measure the
amount of dark matter, right.

01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:37.070
In the solar system
is the equivalent

01:05:37.070 --> 01:05:42.670
of about 1 proton per cubic
centimeter worth of dark matter,

01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:45.500
whereas it something
like 10 billion times

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:47.920
that much of the regular matter.

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.530
So it's very hard to measure on
these scales, you have to look

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:54.090
on very large scales,
not small scales.

01:05:54.090 --> 01:05:56.810
&gt;&gt; So we know it exists, we
just don't know where it is.

01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:59.880
&gt;&gt; Jeremy Schnittman: Well we know
where it is on a very broad area.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:04.330
You know we know it kind of clumps
around galaxies and clusters,

01:06:04.330 --> 01:06:12.290
but you can't say whether it's on
the size of a solar system or not.

01:06:12.290 --> 01:06:13.760
