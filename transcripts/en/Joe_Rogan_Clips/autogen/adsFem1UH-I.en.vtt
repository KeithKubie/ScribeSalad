fascinating about adderall is what

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790
fascinating about adderall is what
 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.760
fascinating about adderall is what
they've essentially done is taken an

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770
they've essentially done is taken an
 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.460
they've essentially done is taken an
amphetamine and made it so that if you

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470
amphetamine and made it so that if you
 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.850
amphetamine and made it so that if you
prescribed it for a condition right like

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
prescribed it for a condition right like
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.700
prescribed it for a condition right like
they give it to people what ad D is one

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710
they give it to people what ad D is one
 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.139
they give it to people what ad D is one
right whatever the fuck that means

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149
right whatever the fuck that means
 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.719
right whatever the fuck that means
and it's very debatable whether or not

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729
and it's very debatable whether or not
 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.609
and it's very debatable whether or not
you have it or don't have everybody here

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619
you have it or don't have everybody here
 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.069
you have it or don't have everybody here
saying I have it for sure if it is real

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079
saying I have it for sure if it is real
 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.959
saying I have it for sure if it is real
if it's real I have it but they give you

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969
if it's real I have it but they give you
 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.389
if it's real I have it but they give you

give to somebody who has supposedly has
 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.199
give to somebody who has supposedly has
a condition and by the way I'm not

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209
a condition and by the way I'm not
 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.680
a condition and by the way I'm not
diagnosing you if you're out there

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
diagnosing you if you're out there
 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.790

now just listen to me
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.820
now just listen to me
it's fucking speed

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
it's fucking speed
 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.830
it's fucking speed
maybe you need speed maybe you're that

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840
maybe you need speed maybe you're that
 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.690
maybe you need speed maybe you're that
person that needs speed maybe you do

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700
person that needs speed maybe you do
 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.820
person that needs speed maybe you do
need it legitimately as a medication but

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830
need it legitimately as a medication but
 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.760
need it legitimately as a medication but
there's a fuckload of people that are

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770
there's a fuckload of people that are
 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.700
there's a fuckload of people that are
just doing speed so by somebody giving

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710
just doing speed so by somebody giving
 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.200
just doing speed so by somebody giving
you speed is supposed to slow you down

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210
you speed is supposed to slow you down
 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.940
you speed is supposed to slow you down
so you won't have a DD is that the

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950
so you won't have a DD is that the
 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.490
so you won't have a DD is that the
reason they say legit if you have the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500
reason they say legit if you have the
 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.030
reason they say legit if you have the
legit a DD look I am not doubting that

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040
legit a DD look I am not doubting that
 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.850
legit a DD look I am not doubting that
some people have 100 I have worse than I

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860
some people have 100 I have worse than I
 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.710
some people have 100 I have worse than I
have yeah there's a spectrum right with

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720
have yeah there's a spectrum right with
 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.830
have yeah there's a spectrum right with
everything but for some people when they

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840
everything but for some people when they
 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.610
everything but for some people when they
take adderall or similar type of

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620
take adderall or similar type of
 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.200
take adderall or similar type of
substances it actually lets them focus

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210
substances it actually lets them focus
 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.180
substances it actually lets them focus
and they can they can actually be on

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190
and they can they can actually be on
 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.340
and they can they can actually be on
track so by speeding it up somehow it

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350
track so by speeding it up somehow it
 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.310
track so by speeding it up somehow it
focuses at it I think it's I think the

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320
focuses at it I think it's I think the
 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.690
focuses at it I think it's I think the
idea is that it's proof that their

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700
idea is that it's proof that their
 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.480
idea is that it's proof that their
system is wired wrong which is why when

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490
system is wired wrong which is why when
 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.250
system is wired wrong which is why when
you give them that speed they can Center

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260
you give them that speed they can Center
 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.830
you give them that speed they can Center
out and mellow out
