00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.160
Australia is a country that is seemingly exists
to kill you.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.720
Many of the world’s most venomous animals
live there, but, that might actually be a

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.070
good thing.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.049
Recently scientists went hunting for these
guys, deadly funnel web spiders.

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:19.120
They captured three, brought the wee beasties
back to the lab and found something curious

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.260
in their venom that may have some surprising
medical benefits for humans.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.260
Venom is bad.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.260
Yes.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.190
It’s evolutionarily designed to kill.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.380
Mmm-Hmm.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.380
And yet.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.490
But, venom is also good.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.780
Venom is a toxic cocktail of proteins and
peptides that precisely target molecules in

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.289
their victim’s.

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:42.350
Once venom hits the bloodstream it works quickly
to either thin the blood, block messages between

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.159
nerves and muscles, and/or some other awful
outcome that just does not end well for the

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:48.159
prey.

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:49.159
*evil look*

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:50.159
But, that’s because the spider’s just
trying to live!

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:51.489
It just wants to eat!

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.390
If you think of venom more objectively, there
are a number of peptides and enzymes in venom

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.550
itself that can be scientifically extracted
and used for good!

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.430
Scientists are hoping to isolate peptides
in animal toxins, synthesize and modify them

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.430
to treat diseases with no lethal side effects
… basically transforming venom from a weapon

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.659
into medicine.

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.490
Venom-based drugs have been in our medicine
cabinets for a while now.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.310
Back in the late 1960s, a clinician discovered
a toxic peptide in the venom of the Brazilian

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.619
Pit Viper that happened to selectively inhibit
the action of angiotensin-converting enzyme

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.119
or ACE.

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.820
ACE is a chemical that plays a role in regulating
blood pressure by causing vessels to constrict.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.049
This led to the development of a class of
drugs called ACE inhibitors, which are used

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.590
today to fight hypertension and congestive
heart failure.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.719
Awesome, right?

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.060
Knowing that, think about what we could learn.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.310
There are over 100,000 venomous creatures
out there, which means the possibilities for

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.070
future medical breakthroughs could be hiding
inside a predator’s lethal venom anywhere

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.180
on the planet!

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.009
Which brings us back to these funnel-web-hunting
scientists.

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.350
The scientists came across a similar breakthrough
by looking closely at funnel web spider venom.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.509
It contains a peptide: Hi1a, that’s known
to “block acid-sensing ion channels in the

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.830
brain, which are key drivers of brain damage
after a stroke.”

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.860
To test it, they isolated Hi1a and gave it
to rats.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.260
Then, they induced strokes in the rats, and
found that the Hi1a spider peptide protected

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.590
up to 77 percent of the rat’s brain cells
post-stroke!

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.599
Yay!

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.930
I mean it sucks for those rats, but it’s
a breakthrough for stroke research!

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.510
There are currently no drugs on the market
that can protect your brain if you have one,

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.150
so this is really promising.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.480
And it’s not just snakes and spiders.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.060
Scorpion toxins could treat autoimmune disease,
centipede venom could help with chronic pain,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.280
and gila monster proteins might treat diabetes.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.050
There are even deadly snails crawling along
the ocean floor filled with potent neurotoxins

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.909
-- and inside that neurotoxin is a peptide
that can reduce pain.

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.010
Scientists synthesized it into a painkiller
that is supposed to be 1,000 times more potent

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.069
than morphine.

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:05.910
Bottom line, we’re hardwired to be afraid
of snakes and spiders, but thanks to science

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.730
they’re saving huge numbers of lives every
day.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.459
That doesn’t mean you should go out in your
backyard and catch a deadly snake thinking

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:33.720
you’ll find a cure for alzheimers … let
the crazy experts do that!

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.010
My dad used to say snakes were aliens.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.409
No DAD.

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:38.860
But they are pretty weird.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.939
How did they evolved to swallow things whole
for example?

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:43.770
We got the answers here:
Are you too freaked out by spiders to even

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.440
watch this video, I don’t know how you made
it this far, but tell us down in the comments,

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.700
make sure you subscribe for more Seeker and
thank you for watching.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
One more thing happy birthday Lauren our new Associate Producer who wrote this episode.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.700
Happy birthday!
