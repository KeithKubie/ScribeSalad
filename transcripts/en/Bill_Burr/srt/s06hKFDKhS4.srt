1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,010
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:03,011 --> 00:00:05,740
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the
Monday morning podcasts for Monday,

3
00:00:05,741 --> 00:00:10,420
November 21st, 2060 what's going on? How,

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,440
why? Yeah. How's it going? Oh,

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:18,970
I'm doing good man. I hope you guys
are do, Oh, it's a holiday weekend.

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:22,330
Doobie Doobie. Do in school to lead Bop.

7
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:26,350
You only have to work three days
unless your boss is a fuck and cont

8
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,510
there's always other ones too. Oh,

9
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,860
if you're fucking self employed or if
you're not happy with your home life,

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:36,340
you'll come up with a reason. Right.

11
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,870
To go back into work just
to fucking avoid it. Um,

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,900
yeah. You know what, this
year, cause uh, you know,

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,310
we've been getting the
fucking kitchen done.

14
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:46,650
We don't have time to cook and anything.

15
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,190
So we're actually going to a friend's
house for a Thanksgiving, which is,

16
00:00:51,191 --> 00:00:55,730
which is great because they
live in the same city as us,

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,820
so we don't have to go to the
fucking airport right now.

18
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,390
All these fucking people
waddling around, you know,

19
00:01:01,391 --> 00:01:06,220
those people just oblivious of other
peanuts. A great fucking human being,

20
00:01:06,221 --> 00:01:10,720
just totally being all about yourself.
Oblivious moment is when fucking people,

21
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:11,351
you know,

22
00:01:11,351 --> 00:01:15,550
there's a whole herd of people just riding
down an escalator and people like the

23
00:01:15,551 --> 00:01:17,140
second they step off it,

24
00:01:17,141 --> 00:01:19,810
they don't keep walking and get
the fuck out of the way. They just,

25
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:23,370
they're just all fucking
oblivious. It's like, Ugh,

26
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,880
you would just on the escalator,
this 50 people in front of you,

27
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,320
a hundred people behind
your touchdown. Fuck,

28
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,800
sorry, I got the game
on. What a fucking throw.

29
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:38,260
What the fuck is going on with
the packers this year, man,

30
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,160
I don't fucking get it. Um, anyway, sorry
about the screaming there. You know,

31
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,070
you've got 50 people in front of, you
got 100 fucking people behind you.

32
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,150
You know,

33
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,120
and people are getting off their kind of
meandering and you're on the escalator

34
00:01:52,121 --> 00:01:57,010
thinking go, go get out of the way before
we all fall down on each other. Right.

35
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,060
For any sort of a thinking human being
going like, oh, assessing the problem.

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,720
Well, when in fucking eight
seconds when I become that person,

37
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,820
I'm going to get the fuck out of the way.

38
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,190
So whoever the fuck is 20 people behind
me will not be having this panic moment

39
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:16,420
because of me going to become
part of part of the solution,

40
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,790
not the fucking problem. Right.

41
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,340
I don't even know what I'm
talking about at this point.

42
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,420
I can't remember the point I
was trying to make, but what,

43
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:26,380
I know what I'm saying. Yeah.

44
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,460
The kind of fucking people like you know
was that hard? I'm sorry thanksgiving.

45
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,190
That's right. Right. So
we're going to fucking pee.

46
00:02:33,191 --> 00:02:35,020
I have no idea what my point
is. You know what I mean?

47
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,580
I just said a bunch of shit.

48
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:40,330
I hope it was funny cause God knows there
was no point and I think that actually

49
00:02:40,331 --> 00:02:45,190
is the point of the Monday morning podcast
for all you people out there who you

50
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:47,650
know who tend to take it
unbelievably seriously.

51
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,660
Those of you out there who think that
I influence the fucking election isn't

52
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:52,503
that hilarious.

53
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,080
$7 billion was spent to get Trump and all
these fucking people a to get elected.

54
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:02,830
But you know that all goes
out the window. The second,

55
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,350
some fuckhead who can't
even read out loud,

56
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:11,350
does a podcast all out the window.
I'll tell you if that's true.

57
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:14,380
I'm going to start, I'm going to start
charging more for my fucking advertising.

58
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,813
You know what I mean?

59
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,750
Maybe I'll use that as a selling
point in 2017 I evidently I was,

60
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,920
I was the reason Trump got into
fucking office. Oh, Jesus. Hey, hey,

61
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:26,890
Trump's support. Is he liking
what you're seeing so far? Uh,

62
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,470
you like in these fucking, you know,

63
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:31,510
you thought Trump was all
looking at fucking people.

64
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:36,250
He surrounded himself with Jesus Christ.
If they're not an a Nazi fucking movie,

65
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,870
they're like 450 fucking
years old. Rudy Giuliani.

66
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,850
This is like when some old hair metal
band gets back together again thinking

67
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,730
they're going to put out a fucking
relevant album. You're not, it's over.

68
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:53,890
You had your time. It's fucking
done. You know what I mean?

69
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,030
These guys are going to get the fucking
band back together and start singing it.

70
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,560
What, uh, girls in a
strip club and the devil,

71
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,180
maybe the PMRC or whatever the fuck
people used to sing about back in the day.

72
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:11,680
I don't pretend enough. Um, you know,

73
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,560
we were fucked either way. All
these fucking people, by the way,

74
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:16,630
I got to give a shout out to somebody. Um,

75
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,200
what's her name from
Cosmopolitan magazine,

76
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,430
Laura Beck calling out SNL for
the horse. Shit that, that was,

77
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:29,730
that was that opening completely agreed
when they were saying that the woman who

78
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:31,420
plays, uh, Clinton,

79
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,920
Hillary Clinton played La Luhya
and it was kinda confusing.

80
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:40,060
Like is was this a tr a tribute to
fucking, uh, Leonard Cohen Dying?

81
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:43,780
Or was this a political
fucking statement? And uh,

82
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,230
she kind of called them out going,

83
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,580
didn't you guys have Trump as a fucking
house two while he was running for

84
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:50,680
president and now all
of a sudden, you know,

85
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:53,320
you help promote the
Guy Denya I mean, shit,

86
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:56,470
if I did by trashing both
fucking people, right?

87
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,920
She actually said it was bullshit. It
was fucking hilarious. It's a great read.

88
00:04:59,921 --> 00:05:04,120
I'll give you guys a, uh, a link
to it, but I mean it's a TV show.

89
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:04,954
That's what they do.

90
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:07,480
They did that to a buddy mandated
that the fucking Dane Cook,

91
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:10,120
they had them fucking, uh, host it twice.

92
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,140
He made him a bunch of fucking monies
with high ratings and then all of a sudden

93
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:16,450
there's a little blip on the
fucking Internet, you know,

94
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,990
tide turns a little bit and then they
use them as a fucking cheap joke when he

95
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:24,820
wasn't even a, he wasn't even on the
shelf. That's what they do over there.

96
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,260
That's what they do in this business
then at you fucking friends. See,

97
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,710
that's why, you know what you do, you
stay where I stay, right? My little cave.

98
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:37,690
You do a podcast by yourself and
then no one can hurt you. Um,

99
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:44,650
anyways, um, so I, uh,

100
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,990
every time I do a stand
up special, you know,

101
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,890
and ends up being a little bit too
long, at least the last couple ones.

102
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:54,010
So you start thinking, what
if we take this out here when,

103
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,910
if we do a little fucking
thing here and we have to do,

104
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,350
and you end up fucking the whole thing up,

105
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:01,490
but you really have to do is you just
gotta, you gotta cut off a limb, you know,

106
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,910
you've gotta remove a kidney. Basically.
You just got to take out a chunk.

107
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,090
And I figured out what junk it
was going to be, or I had an,

108
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,950
an idea that that's what I wanted. And
then the director Jay had the same idea.

109
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:17,951
We took it out and it flows and it
went from a too long of a special.

110
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:22,490
Now it's like fucking perfect.
And now we're going to, uh, and,

111
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,840
and all I've seen at this point
is just the raw feed of it.

112
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:31,160
So it's not even like an HD and it looks
way over lit. And am I fucking pasty?

113
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,030
God Damn Whitehead,

114
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,220
I look like an asshole and it
still looks like a good special.

115
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:38,750
So I'm very excited. I got that
done. F is for family. Second season,

116
00:06:38,751 --> 00:06:41,180
we're starting to fucking, you know,

117
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,920
tighten these things down for
the final fucking edit. And, um,

118
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,890
and then next month
I'm going to start, uh,

119
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:53,780
the process of which should be a quick
edit is editing the audio from when I did

120
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:57,560
Madison Square Garden a year ago for
the New York comedy festival, sorry,

121
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,640
hiccups in New York comedy festival.
I didn't almost get emotional there,

122
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:06,890
New York comedy festival.
Um, and then if once I get,

123
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:11,780
I get all that shit done right
then I'm just like done, I'm done.

124
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,500
I can just enjoy the rest of the fucking
year. I've got nothing to do really.

125
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:19,520
Right. And then, uh, then it
starts all over again in January.

126
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,660
You know, it'd be nice if I did cardio
for the rest of the week and just,

127
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:25,220
you know, then I can fucking throw down.

128
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,740
That's another good thing about going
to somebody's place for the holidays.

129
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:32,150
They got clean up, you know, you know,
leave with a bunch of fucking food.

130
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,510
It's going to be good. Um,

131
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,670
I'm excited about that and he wants me
to make this fucking stuff and I knew she

132
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:39,710
wouldn't let me just go
over there. It's like,

133
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:42,470
why can't I just be the
12 pack guy? You know,

134
00:07:42,471 --> 00:07:45,560
that's the best guy you put on a
sweater, right? You go over there,

135
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:49,280
you make people fucking laugh to show
up with like a 12 or fucking whatever,

136
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,890
whatever the fuck you want. You know,

137
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:54,620
I tried this IPA lately and
I'm not really not an IPA guy.

138
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:56,360
I go in and out of that
shit. I usually drink,

139
00:07:56,361 --> 00:08:00,390
just drink shit that's considered
a white trash beer and I'm,

140
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,950
because I dislike it and fucked up,
you know, I'm not into the taste.

141
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,550
I just won't get fucked up.
Right. And I want you guys to say,

142
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:10,220
well those IPA A's have a
fucking high alcohol content.

143
00:08:10,221 --> 00:08:15,140
I don't give a shit that. Fuck,
they're heavy. Fucking heavy as hell.

144
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:19,940
But I tried this one, it was called the
Green Line and I got it. I don't even,

145
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,170
because they only had a
couple beers at this place.

146
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,800
It was this goofy fucking place and
I just wanted a beer and they were,

147
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:30,080
that's one of the only ones they had.
I actually really liked it. Remind me,

148
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:31,010
living in Boston,

149
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:35,810
fucking going out to fucking chestnut
hill and the gray light doe Kenmore

150
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:40,690
Square. Go to the fucking
socks. Rich gang man, Joe Fisk.

151
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,370
Um, Gary Allen said, oh Jesus,

152
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,020
there's a couple of red sox names
from way back in the day. Anyways, um,

153
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,230
I tried that shit. I actually
really liked it and uh,

154
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,260
I don't even want it you guys.

155
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:57,570
I'm just fucking talking in
circles cause I haven't been home,

156
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,770
haven't been to my house in like
fucking two months and uh, I've had it,

157
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,810
me and dia had been living on top of
each other and uh, you know, I, uh,

158
00:09:06,811 --> 00:09:07,730
I don't know about her, but I'm,

159
00:09:07,731 --> 00:09:11,070
I'm pretty sick of us being
this close to one another.

160
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,390
So hopefully Tuesday we get back
in the fucking place. Oh, nice.

161
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:16,224
Fucking throw out,

162
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,280
right Rogers over the top DB complaint
and Sadie fucking pushed off course.

163
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:26,420
You're going to say that it's what you
say when a guy fucking on a tight end

164
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,540
beach, you that deep as a fucking
corner. How the hell does that happen?

165
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:31,850
How do you let that
happen? I ask you guys,

166
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,960
he pushed him within five yards.
I think that was all right. Um,

167
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,830
anyways, how about those Bruins? Huh?
Handling Winnipeg? I was all nervous day.

168
00:09:42,831 --> 00:09:45,230
The top two score is in
the league. What did we do?

169
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:49,910
We put fucking three of them. Three
goals in the second period, right?

170
00:09:49,911 --> 00:09:52,640
Who scored fuck in Mash, Yan fucking

171
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:59,090
Bergie Belski whatever the fuck his name
is. And then, I don't know fluctuates.

172
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,060
We actually went up for enough of one,
four to one. That's another thing.

173
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:04,640
When I get back, I got my
Bruins and Celtics package.

174
00:10:04,641 --> 00:10:08,510
I can start watching that shit so I can
really start boring you guys with the

175
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,700
sports talk. You know,

176
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,520
I didn't see the Patriots game today
cause I've been running around.

177
00:10:13,521 --> 00:10:16,760
I haven't been spending time with my
wife, so I took her out someplace today.

178
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,110
She'll come on later, I'll
tell you all about it. And, um,

179
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,840
but all I know is it's the usual shit.

180
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:25,950
All my fucking friends who
are pats fans like, dude,

181
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:30,620
why'd we trade Chandler Joe, AJ,
why we get rid of Jamie Collins?

182
00:10:30,621 --> 00:10:34,220
I fucking defense stank
stowed. Um, so I think it was,

183
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,630
you know what, should've been an
easy gay. My kiss evidently wasn't,

184
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,530
but a, I didn't see any of that.
I watched the boxing though.

185
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,910
Who the fuck that Russian guy that ego
Larry or enough was that his fucking

186
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:51,290
name? Whether it was a real hacky
Russian name was surrogate Culver lev,

187
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,980
which is like every
Russian guy in the NHL Se.

188
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:57,460
This first name is Sergei
or his last name is cold.

189
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,860
That's really like the John
Smith of Russian names.

190
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,750
So he's fighting this American dude.

191
00:11:02,751 --> 00:11:07,670
So I got to go for the fucking American
and uh, I got to tell you something.

192
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,810
The fucking first, first
fucking round. All right,

193
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,700
Eagle rer off comes out and
he fucking punches Andre Reed.

194
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,590
Is that the guy's name or is
that the guy in the bills?

195
00:11:18,591 --> 00:11:21,590
I can't fucking remember. I'm not a
big box and fan. I love the sport.

196
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,670
I love it, but a, it's been
ruined. It's been ruined.

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,330
Cause every three pounds is a new
weight class that as yet another fucking

198
00:11:29,331 --> 00:11:33,170
champion. And then there's like 15
different fucking boxing federations.

199
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,180
It's a shit show. Like there's more
boxing divisions than there are podcasts.

200
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,520
And I'll tell you that's ain't some,
cause there's a lot out there, um,

201
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:48,080
that, you know what I mean?
When I was a kid, it was like,

202
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:53,040
it was like fly weight. It was like
flyweight featherweight, middleweight,

203
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,890
welterweight, heavyweight, something
like that. I can't even remember.

204
00:11:56,891 --> 00:12:00,340
I can't remember the fucking divisions
now. Everything's things like,

205
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:04,150
there's like 15 offshoots of each
one of them. It's, you know what,

206
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:07,240
it's like those superhero
movies, like back in the day,

207
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:11,170
like Superman was in a superman
movie. Batman was in a bat.

208
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,120
They didn't fucking know each other.

209
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:17,500
They weren't all hanging out at the same
place. Maybe on the, the super friends,

210
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:21,190
they were super friends. They
did at the hall of Justice.

211
00:12:21,191 --> 00:12:23,920
But they only did that. They
did that when they drew it,

212
00:12:23,921 --> 00:12:26,770
but they never had that in
movies. You know what I mean?

213
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:31,330
Superman was Christopher Reeves.
That was his fucking shit. And a

214
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,740
see Batman, right? Oh they have.

215
00:12:36,741 --> 00:12:41,570
They had Michael Keaton remember that
and he was all sweaty in the locker room

216
00:12:41,571 --> 00:12:44,330
with just a towel around
him wearing the bat mask.

217
00:12:44,331 --> 00:12:48,140
And he got in the face of val Kilmer
and he was like, that's right ice man,

218
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,360
I am dangerous. And then Val said,

219
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,810
clicked his fucking teeth together
and then they all played volleyball,

220
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,850
you know? And then they
were playing volleyball.

221
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,070
Aquaman did come out of the ocean.
Dedi you know what I mean? Look at it.

222
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:05,120
Batman being like, take
my breath away, dude.

223
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:10,170
Who Do you know Kelly McGillis gets in
her invisible jet? I can't remember the,

224
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,290
I can't believe the fucking
names I remember for that movie.

225
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,630
I saw that movie a bunch of times.

226
00:13:14,631 --> 00:13:17,510
I was the one that I owned
on VHS when and cut tank.

227
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,610
Tank of buckle [inaudible] right.

228
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,850
I was in high school and everybody
wasn't wanting to get a fucking Ninja

229
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:27,620
motorcycle and fucking fly f
sixteenths, you know, inverted.

230
00:13:27,621 --> 00:13:28,970
We all thought we were going to do that.

231
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,330
You know this every once in a while
like a movie comes out and you're like,

232
00:13:32,331 --> 00:13:36,350
you know what, I'm going to fucking
do that. Right? And then what happens?

233
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,610
You know what happens?
Geometry, Algebra two and trig.

234
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,120
All of that happens and then you're
like, oh, I'll wait a minute. Wait,

235
00:13:44,121 --> 00:13:46,410
I thought, I think I
was going to fly jets.

236
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,860
Is that what I thought was
going to happen? I'm sorry,

237
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,050
I'm going to be a salesman.

238
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,980
You know I make people laugh. You
know I, you know, I come into a room,

239
00:13:57,981 --> 00:14:00,820
I make people feel good. What you
got a product? I'll do it. Huh?

240
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:05,860
I you set the cotton potatoes
like this. What if you had that?

241
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:12,140
I like the guy with the John Riggins
fucking Jersey and the crowd at the

242
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,950
Redskins. Gay Man, 44 was always
a bad ass fucking number of,

243
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,040
there was always a fullback number
when I was growing up. John Riggins,

244
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:23,780
Robert Newhouse, you know chuck foreman,
he, I think he was a running back.

245
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:27,920
Was he 44 that was a bad ass
fucking number. Reggie Jackson,

246
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,690
you know, now you, this guy starts,
he's got to live. That's it.

247
00:14:31,691 --> 00:14:36,680
That's a fucking legendary number. I
wouldn't have any fucking hall of famers.

248
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:40,940
We're 44. I've fucked dead.

249
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,130
How many fucking, just like
skirts were 44. Not a lot.

250
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,040
Everybody ever wore 44 was a
tough mother fucker. Right.

251
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,650
I like to think John
Riggins broke my heart man.

252
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:54,440
Cause I was a big time cowboys
fan back then. Um, before,

253
00:14:54,441 --> 00:14:58,790
how bout damn cowboys and they kicked
out Tom Landry and Tex Schramm. Uh,

254
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:01,070
that was just the worst. You know,

255
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:04,100
I thought Tom Landry was going to be
this forever. You know, I was young.

256
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:04,934
I didn't know.

257
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,710
I didn't know people get old and their
pastors and by fucked up right. And uh,

258
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,510
I hated the fucking Redskins for beating
the cowboys so much that when they were

259
00:15:14,511 --> 00:15:17,900
in that Superbowl actually rooted for
the dolphins and I hated the fucking

260
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:20,930
dolphins cause we can
never beat them. And, uh,

261
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,260
when Riggins broke through the line
and whoever the fuck that was on the

262
00:15:24,261 --> 00:15:28,160
dolphins that came by and just grabbed
him by the waist and slid down,

263
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,510
I'm like a greased fucking pole. And
he just kept running that it killed me.

264
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:38,030
Was it a j Dewey? I don't
fucking remember. Anyways.

265
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,960
Um, how much time have I done here
is a time for the fucking region.

266
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,510
I don't think so. Um, hey, Neha,

267
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,900
you want to come in here and
tell people about your day?

268
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,860
I gotta tell you this shit, right?
So I haven't been, you know,

269
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,710
I've been fucking
busting my ass. You know,

270
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,610
I was getting ready to do this special
and then editing all that bullshit I

271
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:01,520
talked about earlier. So, you know, if
you don't spend time with your wife,

272
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,610
all of a sudden your wife gets
all upset with you. Like, oh,

273
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:09,410
you don't spend time with me and
Boohoo who I have fucking needs.

274
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,920
Hey Nia, I'm just, I'm doing a character.

275
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:16,500
What the fuck did I do with the
market? There's the microphone.

276
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:21,050
There's the microphone. All right.
Hello. Talk to me. Talk to me goose.

277
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:26,150
Hello. Um, so anyways, yeah, I
haven't been spending time with you.

278
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,520
So I figured today, you know what,
I gotta go, I gotta do something,

279
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,690
I gotta do something. So I, uh,

280
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:37,750
took my wife to go see Cassa blanket
today while the Patriots were on.

281
00:16:38,271 --> 00:16:42,050
I got to get credit
for that. Okay. So, um,

282
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,050
I thought it was at this old theater I
was telling you about these guys on, on,

283
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,320
I think Thursday I was telling
them about it. Like there was,

284
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,470
there's all these old theaters out here
that I'm obsessed with where they had

285
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:54,830
the Oscars throughout the years. Yeah.
I just think of all the great, you know,

286
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,810
Comedians and actors and directors
and everything, they'd been on him.

287
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,100
I love that sense of history.
Right. So you've got the Pantageous,

288
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,120
you've got the fucking who's
mill, what's out in Santa Monica,

289
00:17:05,121 --> 00:17:07,790
the Kodak Theater, all these
fucking places. So, um,

290
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:10,250
I just remember that one from
the 80s that I always saw,

291
00:17:10,251 --> 00:17:12,980
I guess it was in downtown La. Maybe
that's the one down the other way.

292
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:16,040
I don't fucking know. But I just looked
him up and I was like, you know what,

293
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:19,850
I'd love to do maybe a show
there or I might want to do, um,

294
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,570
you know, just go to something. And I,

295
00:17:22,571 --> 00:17:26,150
I looked up that one
downtown and it said a,

296
00:17:26,151 --> 00:17:28,850
there was just a bunch of orchestras
there and then it said it was Casablanca.

297
00:17:28,851 --> 00:17:32,060
I'm like a fucking love Humphrey Bogart.
I'll take, need to go see that shit.

298
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,250
So we go down and of course we show
up in the theater. I want to go into,

299
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,020
there's nobody there.
They're like, oh yeah, yeah,

300
00:17:42,021 --> 00:17:45,950
it's not here. It's at the theater
next door. There's a little old couple.

301
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,670
So you go up and, um, we're walking
around the theater completely

302
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:55,080
deserted. Amari starting to
curse up a fucking storm. Yeah.

303
00:17:55,081 --> 00:17:58,750
Bill's already getting hot. I'll go
fuck down. I was on the fucking website.

304
00:17:58,751 --> 00:18:02,080
I looked it up. I looked
it up twice. I did,

305
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:07,081
I looked it up a couple who are
walking with their little bonnets on,

306
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,380
cause it was raining outside.
Yeah. Bill asked like, oh,

307
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:14,340
is this where they're having the movie?
I was a little more frantic than that.

308
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,840
Yeah, but you got, you
guys come from the movie.

309
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,650
You were old and that was my energy.

310
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:26,170
It's across the street at the
concert hall and you had your,

311
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,640
one of your classic, you, you,

312
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,190
you made the mistake until you
started having a little meltdown.

313
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,580
I didn't make a mistake because if you
look at the fucking theater up and you

314
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:42,290
look at calendar, okay, and it says it
was at the Dorothy Chandler pavilion. No,

315
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:45,950
you click on calendar events and then
it just, it lists and it lists that,

316
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,640
but I think the same person owns the
theater. It's very fucking, you know,

317
00:18:49,641 --> 00:18:52,130
it's like buying a car.
Yeah, we got it this lot.

318
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:55,080
And all of a sudden you're
down the street. It's like
you're in good fellas now.

319
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,760
A little further down. I don't know
Jimmy. I think I'll pick it up tomorrow.

320
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,370
That's what they did to me. Well, anyway,

321
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,480
it was across the street at the Walt
Disney Concert symphony looking thing that

322
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:09,170
looks like a fucking exploded
golf ball designed by Frank Gehry.

323
00:19:09,171 --> 00:19:13,130
It's like one of the most like impressive.
It's like the drummer from extreme,

324
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:15,950
isn't it? No, it's a very
famous architect, like

325
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,400
what you see here? Get the fuck out,

326
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,060
get the fuck out, get the fuck out.
Get the fuck out. What are you singing?

327
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:30,520
We won't try to, it's one of the
widest. Trying to be funky songs ever.

328
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:34,560
Get the fun gout. That one.
And then there's the, uh, okay.

329
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:41,070
Some Big Joan is my name anyway, and
building my game. It's one of the worst.

330
00:19:41,071 --> 00:19:46,071
This building was one of the most like
impressive pieces of architecture in Los

331
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:49,710
Angeles. It's a beautifully designed
space and bill is just like,

332
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,040
I couldn't help but laugh at you because
you were just muttering and cursing and

333
00:19:56,041 --> 00:20:00,000
stomping around in the
rain and you're like, oh,

334
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:05,140
I to go into the gray ones too.
I hate that. Super Modern Shit.

335
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,170
I've done shows in those
stupid symphony fucking things.

336
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,600
You feel like you're in front of the,

337
00:20:09,601 --> 00:20:13,210
like the council and one of those
superman movies where you're like down.

338
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,490
They're all fucking up above
you and they're behind you.

339
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,110
I fucking hate those
things. So I was like,

340
00:20:17,111 --> 00:20:19,540
I don't want to fucking go into
this thing. So I end up show,

341
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,060
but it's like I got to take her to
this thing. It's fucking raining out.

342
00:20:22,061 --> 00:20:24,120
So Nice. All like whoa.

343
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,320
Could go to the theater another time
when it's a dance event to like calm you

344
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:32,770
down because it's now we're going to
another building. No big deal. You know,

345
00:20:32,771 --> 00:20:35,830
we're going to go seek it. And then
what happened? Don't worry, we show up,

346
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:39,760
we show up and I go, hey, can I get,
and I literally said to you, go,

347
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,430
now we're going to fucking go to this
stupid ass fucking theater, right?

348
00:20:42,431 --> 00:20:44,200
It's probably in some small
room. It's gonna be you,

349
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:49,090
me and four other old people and the
movies, the movies almost ready to start,

350
00:20:49,091 --> 00:20:49,361
right?

351
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:54,361
So we fucking show up and I
go up to the booth and I go,

352
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,900
yeah, I need two tickets to
Casablanca. And the person's like, oh,

353
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,670
I don't know if there's any
tickets left. And I'm like,

354
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:06,760
what are you talking about?
It's raining. It's Sunday.

355
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:09,880
Football's on his fucking
movies like 80 years old.

356
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:14,110
And who was going to come
see dad check, right?

357
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:17,800
And then she finally goes,
well, you can't, I should
be found too. And I'm like,

358
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:20,890
thank Christ, trying to do
something romantic here.

359
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,920
It's not the right fucking theater. Now
they're going to be sold out. She goes,

360
00:21:23,921 --> 00:21:28,090
you gotta go down to Windows. So I say,
fine. I kept my cool, they're there,

361
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:32,380
right? The rain and rain enough on my
steaming head that I walked over at,

362
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,140
cools you off a little bit, pulled me
off a little bit and I walk home, I go,

363
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,640
let me get too. And I, they go, okay.
And then they go and the guy goes, okay,

364
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,770
that's going to be $161
right? I go $161 he goes,

365
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,510
each and we both were like,
wait, what are you talking?

366
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:52,450
So it turned out no way. So this
is what it turns. It turns out,

367
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:54,580
I think this is way too loud
here. I gotta turn this down here.

368
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,460
It turns out that, um,

369
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,810
what was happening was the La Philharmonic
was going to be playing the film

370
00:22:01,811 --> 00:22:03,910
score while you watch the movie.

371
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,500
It turns out this is a major la cultural
event that basically that was just

372
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:14,550
going to be a movie for

373
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,250
a few old people in us. It
turns out it's this major event.

374
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,890
Every he's got on like sport coats
and fucking dresses and shit.

375
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,290
I'm sitting there, my wet Hoodie,

376
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,000
Humphrey Bogart in there. What
the fuck's going on? Right?

377
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,410
We're going to view the view the body,

378
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,460
Aaron Eckhart like introduces
the fucking movie. So you know,

379
00:22:39,461 --> 00:22:42,130
you know when you just don't
give a shit, I just said fuck it.

380
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:43,990
So I light up the card and I go,

381
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,450
let's go in there and then I start
getting this feeling of like,

382
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,480
this might be my, this
might be fucking amazing.

383
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,060
And then there's all these ushers walking
around hitting these things that have

384
00:22:52,061 --> 00:22:56,800
gone boom, boom. Like letting people
know that, you know, that whole,

385
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:58,820
like you don't want to disturb
rich white people, that,

386
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,400
that things are about ready to start,

387
00:23:00,401 --> 00:23:05,170
whatever that fucking instrument is
called. Um, and they fucking go in there.

388
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,730
Uh, we go in there and, and
like, it's like Holy Shit.

389
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,120
Like we're going to listen to what
the La Philharmonic while we watched

390
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:16,690
Casablanca and how fucking
great was. It was amazing.

391
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,520
It was such an awesome experience.
So bill kind of fumbled,

392
00:23:21,521 --> 00:23:25,720
fumbled his way into her really
amazing stuff, romantic date.

393
00:23:25,721 --> 00:23:26,760
And I get no credits.

394
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:29,650
I get no credit because I picked
the wrong fucking theater.

395
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,120
I just totally stumped.
So Kenny and be like, oh,

396
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,770
you see that with the orchestra?
I picked that out on purpose.

397
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:43,590
I feel like you definitely get points
for you seeing that you saw something

398
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:47,240
cultural going on and you're, oh, that
sounds cool. Like Nini would like that.

399
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:51,770
And we went in it, it turned out to be
amazing. So it was, it was great. Yeah.

400
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,770
Aaron, it was bio merit. It wasn't
even a hail Mary, the actor,

401
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,560
the actor came out and
introduced the movie oil man.

402
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:03,380
Is there another famous Aaron Eckhart?
I don't know. Are you being sarcastic?

403
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,770
I'm being a Dick Right now. Was he in?
No. Was he in? No. No country. All Man.

404
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:11,170
He was in there. Get out of here
a bitch in the company of men. Uh,

405
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:16,250
was that him and he was in Salie
Sali. Y'All. You had the mustache?

406
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,690
Yes, he was in that movie.

407
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:24,320
He was in that movie. Which
woof, that was a movie.

408
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,170
That was a movie they
made up. They made it.

409
00:24:27,171 --> 00:24:31,370
Evidently they made up all of this other
shit. It was just so fucking boring.

410
00:24:31,371 --> 00:24:34,640
Can I just say that? You don't
have to say it. I'll say, come on.

411
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:37,880
It's Connie's word. It was
Rappaport. Senate. Jerry's in it.

412
00:24:37,881 --> 00:24:41,540
There's a bunch of buttons. Yes. We
have friends that are in that movie,

413
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:45,380
but that are we a Hollywood
couple of our friends are in it.

414
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,700
That movie was so boring
because you know why?

415
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,200
Because nobody, this is sound
so terrible, but nobody died.

416
00:24:54,650 --> 00:24:57,700
Nobody got no, he nailed heard
like it was just nailed it.

417
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,940
He put it right where he was supposed
to put it. Yeah. There was no hype.

418
00:25:01,941 --> 00:25:04,550
Both my engines went out at 1500 feet.

419
00:25:04,551 --> 00:25:09,260
Should I try to land it in the water or
fly back over the most densely populated

420
00:25:09,261 --> 00:25:13,970
area in the United States. So he put
it in the water. Everyone survived.

421
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:18,560
The whole thing took in real life, 24
minutes for everyone to get rescued.

422
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:22,460
It's like, what is the movie about
it? Well, they had to have them have,

423
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,730
you got to have the evil corporate guys
go on. Your couldn't save that jet.

424
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,830
Yeah, but you push some people out on
the way over. It just wasn't exciting.

425
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:35,750
Tom Hangs is a wonderful actor.
All the acting was great in it.

426
00:25:35,751 --> 00:25:37,550
I want to see what it
was like a serial killer.

427
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:41,240
I'm so sick of him always being doing
the right thing. That's not his brand.

428
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,510
That's not Tom Hanks, his
brand. He's not a serial killer.

429
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,130
Did he die and saving Private Ryan?

430
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,850
Spoiler alert whenever he was just
sitting there firing at the tank.

431
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,150
You never saw that. Now it's not my,
I'm not into those kind of, I'm not,

432
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,980
it's a warm movies, but son,

433
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:59,100
a war movie saving private
Ryan is not about a war. No.

434
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,060
10 soldiers that Diana. Well, I
mean, that's literally what is,

435
00:26:02,061 --> 00:26:03,350
but it's more of a metaphor.

436
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:07,730
It is saving private Ryan
is a medical metaphor.

437
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,240
What is it a metaphor for? Please explain.

438
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,460
You don't even know what
you're talking about.

439
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,940
Do you even know what a metaphor is?
It's an incredible fucking movie.

440
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:20,380
All right. I believe you. All right. Okay.

441
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,840
We kind of just killed
your credibility to say,

442
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,820
sell these boring and then you're
like, yeah, I'm not into war.

443
00:26:25,821 --> 00:26:28,670
Movies of Saving Private Ryan is almost
unbelievable. Fucker boobs ever saw.

444
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:32,360
Why does that kill my credibility? Just
because I didn't like sales. I said so.

445
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:37,040
Oh, I see. That's how it works.
One thing has to do with the other.

446
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,980
I don't know. You've been bugging me
lately. Why? Yeah, I dunno. I just,

447
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,720
I don't want to be a dick, but
you putting on weight. Excuse me.

448
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,520
You're like putting on
weight every fucking month.

449
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:51,210
You getting bigger and I keep telling
you to fucking do something about it.

450
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:54,180
I have a condition. You have a condition.

451
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:59,040
What is a condition bigger and bigger?
Every month I would just have enough

452
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,603
[inaudible].

453
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:03,690
Okay.

454
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,000
Yeah. The laugh factory
fucking tweeted that out,

455
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,590
so I guess we gotta announce it.
Yeah, I'm going to be a fucking

456
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,860
father. That would kind of be parents.

457
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:15,210
Everybody though excited for
us. Do you know what it is?

458
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,770
They don't give a shit. I'm actually,

459
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:22,530
I think people have been people
who have, you know who you are.

460
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,550
We already tweeted day offline, stay
offline. You don't become that person.

461
00:27:26,551 --> 00:27:29,490
I feel like people care. Listen. Why?

462
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,190
Because it's going to bring out all
the people who have nasty things to say

463
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,470
about it. No, because people have lives,

464
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,240
but people have been actually
been very sweet. What? What?

465
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,050
No. You know, you're
watching those fucking,

466
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,080
those ladies screaming at each other
too much and the ones where they sit

467
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:47,270
around, you know, it was one of the
funny things I saw lately was when you,

468
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,940
you had the fucking Kardashians
on with the sound down. Yeah.

469
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:55,220
So much of the footage as them just
looking at each other with their fucking

470
00:27:55,221 --> 00:27:59,270
mouth kind of open like slack-jawed
because someone else is talking over the

471
00:27:59,271 --> 00:28:00,650
top. Just going.

472
00:28:00,651 --> 00:28:04,910
I just feel like when Mandy said
to sandy that she, you know,

473
00:28:04,911 --> 00:28:09,710
she couldn't go during the nose job
trip. I felt that she was upset and we,

474
00:28:09,711 --> 00:28:13,270
as the person's talking, they just cut
to their faces. They like doing it.

475
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,770
I can't, it's a visual. They look
like those little pouty cats.

476
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,280
Okay. I mean, okay.

477
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,130
I don't know what that
has to do. I don't know.

478
00:28:22,131 --> 00:28:25,980
I just want you to turn this into a Kelley
rip a moment guys. And this is what,

479
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:29,000
but where it just makes
me feel like, you know,

480
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,190
I'm starting to understand why
Michael Strahan left that show.

481
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:39,580
Um, so anyways, yeah, it's official.
It is confirmed. All right. Yeah.

482
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,773
Okay.

483
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,380
No it is. And I'm, and I'm just going,

484
00:28:43,381 --> 00:28:44,670
I'm not going to one of
these fucking assholes.

485
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:45,823
You're very, you know, you're like,

486
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,380
you're begrudgingly talking about
it and I understand why. I know,

487
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,810
cause I fucking hate parents.
You hate. I hate, I like why

488
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:57,890
one's on [inaudible] he's just
the hardest fucking job. Yeah.

489
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,670
The most rewarding job, like
blah, blah, blah. And you know,

490
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,800
and then they all say it, they all fuck.

491
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,960
Even like chuck Yeager would
say some shit like that.

492
00:29:04,961 --> 00:29:08,170
It's like really dude flying
a fucking jet up into space.

493
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:12,760
Like trying to get a kid's
fucking backpack on for
first grade is more difficult

494
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:15,550
than what the fuck you just went
through up there. You know what I mean?

495
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,440
I think that they play Kate to fucking,

496
00:29:17,441 --> 00:29:20,100
is that the right word to Joe
six pack where they gotta be up?

497
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,100
The real heroes pander, pander. The real
people are the real heroes out there.

498
00:29:25,101 --> 00:29:26,850
The people out there, they're there.

499
00:29:26,851 --> 00:29:29,210
They're there making the
tuna fish sandwiches,

500
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,850
cutting it into four fucking pieces.

501
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:37,340
You had sex and you didn't use protection.
That's what you did now. All right.

502
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:42,670
You're not Tom Hanks pretending to land
a fucking plane into the Hudson River.

503
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:46,360
Okay. You did. It's not exactly
the miracle on the Hudson.

504
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:55,180
So all Billy Booz bag's going to get a
couple more rights and left in before the

505
00:29:55,181 --> 00:29:57,780
little, the little one comes. And
then I'm going to be, I gotta be,

506
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,500
I gotta be so I got to pick my spots.

507
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,440
That is that is that the idea is that's
what's been happening that you've just

508
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,310
got to go on.

509
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:06,880
I'd like a little bit of a bender
[inaudible] on a bender the whole fucking

510
00:30:06,881 --> 00:30:10,000
year. And then when the baby comes, you're
going to just like cut yourself off.

511
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,780
Yeah. I mean, what am I doing? Maybe
fucking hung over and we'll be that guy.

512
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,940
No, I hope not. Yeah. No, I'm not
going to do that. No, it's over.

513
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,880
It's done. But then I got, I got all
this great hooch back at the house,

514
00:30:21,881 --> 00:30:24,960
so I gotta kill it. I gotta
kill it before it comes.

515
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:28,630
You have to like drink all
the alcohol before the baby.

516
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,160
It's not like you're
never going to have a dog.

517
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:35,490
You gotta make space for like fucking
sippy cups and shit. Don't worry.

518
00:30:35,491 --> 00:30:38,200
Don't worry. Don't worry. It'll
suck in my bottles down there.

519
00:30:38,201 --> 00:30:42,580
Not gonna go on the bar
pretty about making,

520
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,740
you know what? I'll save some of my, uh,

521
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:47,470
pappy van winkles he had wanted
the most spoiled kid ever.

522
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,410
When the baby's teething, I'll rub
CPAP even when it goes on. It's what?

523
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:56,540
It's fucking gums. Isn't that what
you're supposed to do? I Dunno. I Dunno.

524
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,530
That's an old school thing, but
I'm already going to do this shit.

525
00:30:59,531 --> 00:31:02,890
Like every time the kid cries, I'm
not fucking going in. I'm going to,

526
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:07,030
there's this great book that I read
on Norwegian parenting that says that,

527
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:11,140
you know, when the kid starts crying,
you just, you just kind of, you know,

528
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:15,220
you creep up to the bed and then
you kind of look and you just go

529
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,833
and then that's it.

530
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:22,480
You scare the shit out of it and
it understands what's going on.

531
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:26,020
You're making fun of what I told you
was in the book that I'm reading.

532
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,020
By the way, it's 29, 24 fucking
Washington Green Bay. Just score.

533
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:33,400
This is a great cam. This reminds me,
one of those old San Diego Charger Games.

534
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:37,510
Are you watching the football game
while you're doing the pockets? Well,

535
00:31:37,511 --> 00:31:40,120
I don't know. I just thought that
stuff that's not a push in the back.

536
00:31:40,121 --> 00:31:43,570
Get the fuck out of here. Anyways,
what were we talking about? Oh,

537
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:47,350
you having a kid. Um,

538
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,850
the biggest moment in our relationship
ever. You know nobody. Well,

539
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,410
let's see what happens. Yes.

540
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,870
We've been gone to like fucking
lamaze classes and shit.

541
00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:01,090
Yes and Christ though the classes had
been great. The classes have been great,

542
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,690
but this, this is how far the
fucking progressive left has gone.

543
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:08,350
There's a fucking line for when
she comes in, it says, mom,

544
00:32:08,351 --> 00:32:12,200
will you sign up at me? I'm thinking
finally name of mother, name of mother.

545
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:14,020
And then I'm like, yeah.
And then my column,

546
00:32:14,021 --> 00:32:17,290
like I'm finally going to be called a dad
after almost living on this planet for

547
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:20,020
half a fucking century.
And it just says partner

548
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,480
fucking ridiculous. And what
kills me is everybody in there,

549
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:29,740
heterosexual, all in a fucking
relationship. Everybody there was was,

550
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,860
there was all straight couples, straight
couples and all the dads were there.

551
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,910
Yeah, yeah, that's true. And let's
just keeps going. Coaches, coaches,

552
00:32:36,911 --> 00:32:38,980
calling them coach. I swear to God, Dude,

553
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,910
I'm going to show up with a
fucking whistle next week.

554
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:46,760
No fucking Bill Belichick Hoodie and
shit. The fuck are you talking about?

555
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:51,230
She said, I guess she probably
probably gonna get in trouble.

556
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,210
She said Dad's twice last
class. I didn't hear it. Yeah.

557
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,360
Got Too busy muttering under your breath
about every time she says coaches,

558
00:32:59,361 --> 00:33:02,300
I say fathers, fathers,

559
00:33:02,301 --> 00:33:05,360
I'm not trying to cut out gay people
or people got bagged behind a fucking

560
00:33:05,361 --> 00:33:08,330
Carl's Jr. You know what
I mean? But what about us?

561
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,010
That's just solution. I
thought it's inclusive.

562
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,100
You're supposed to include people.

563
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:17,510
I'll take second and third billing
behind a alternative people.

564
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:22,260
What did you think of that? I'm birthing
video that we watched the last one.

565
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,870
Oh, Paulie's. Put a placenta.
You know? That was tremendous.

566
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,020
I don't know. I don't even
know why I'm there in here.

567
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:32,330
It's all going to go
out the fucking window.

568
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,830
The doctors and nurses are going to tell
you what to do. I'm just there for you.

569
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,330
Fucking yell at me.
It's so fucking stupid.

570
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,120
If I was going through
gallbladder surgery or whatever,

571
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,900
you would not be in there holding
my fucking hand. It's so dumb.

572
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:47,750
This is just classic you
guys, you know you got,

573
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:51,170
you got the shit end of the stick on
this thing and somehow you figured out a

574
00:33:51,171 --> 00:33:53,630
way to drag us in there.
I'll tell you right now,

575
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:57,350
I'm staying north of that fucking sheet.
Yeah. When that guy comes in and goes,

576
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:00,650
hey, hey, you want to hook up
your own cable? No, I don't.

577
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:05,090
That's what the fuck I'm paying you
for. I don't want you to be below the,

578
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,560
the blanket below deck.

579
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:10,100
You don't need to be below the performance
problems for the next three months.

580
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:13,310
Cause I keep picturing my kid's
head coming out of your Twat. No,

581
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,230
I'm not doing that. I
shouldn't be in there.

582
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:20,520
My fucking didn't mash that ass, you know?

583
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:24,110
But you said after you watched the movie,
you leaned over to me and you said,

584
00:34:24,111 --> 00:34:28,370
I understand now why the guy
isn't there. You did. Yeah.

585
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:32,270
To get yelled at. No,
that's not what it was.

586
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,390
It was to provide comfort. You're
killing my fucking image here. Okay.

587
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:41,160
So stop showing your image,
dad. Now get over it.

588
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:46,820
Fuck your image. Um, no. So I'm
going to, I want to be, yeah,

589
00:34:46,890 --> 00:34:49,780
I'm gonna be a sober debt, but on the
road home, I'll tell him rip it enough.

590
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:54,200
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, just like
every other comic out there.

591
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,290
You're fucking heck.

592
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,760
I told you my last podcast,

593
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,750
I was going for a Boston accent word
and I realized that I was gonna get in

594
00:35:05,751 --> 00:35:08,930
trouble if I said it so that I had
to switch to console. I was like, oh,

595
00:35:08,931 --> 00:35:11,710
I'll talk to you lady.
Oh fuck. Yeah. Cool.

596
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:19,070
Fucking Ben Bailey looks at me. He's
like, Quan subs like that. It's a new day.

597
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:23,870
I'm gonna get in trouble if I say to
him and I don't mean anything by it. So,

598
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,640
um, yeah,

599
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,080
anyone's don't end up like Kanye and
never everybody be mad at you. Oh,

600
00:35:30,081 --> 00:35:33,170
he's going to be fine. He
knows what the fuck he's doing.

601
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:37,560
He was yelling. I mean, to be honest
with you, I don't understand those shows.

602
00:35:37,561 --> 00:35:38,070
Anyways,

603
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,030
there's no band.

604
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:44,740
Everybody's standing with their cell
phones on and this somebody a rapping and

605
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:48,690
then they just stick in them. I, it's,
it's, it's for young kids. They love it.

606
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,350
And I'm not going to go there
like, hey, you think this is music?

607
00:35:52,351 --> 00:35:54,660
I'm not going to be that guy.
I, I stay away from them.

608
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,200
I'm going to go see Casablanca in
the rain with a bunch of old people.

609
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,500
By the way, Nia. Yes. Did
you see during the break,

610
00:36:01,501 --> 00:36:04,230
those old people trying to
walk? Holy fucking shit.

611
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:09,410
I cannot stress stretching and getting a
massage if you can afford to do it once

612
00:36:09,841 --> 00:36:13,680
a month at all. Geez. That was
on a hunched over people. Yeah.

613
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:16,710
A lot of people roughly my fucking
age to having limps and shit.

614
00:36:16,711 --> 00:36:20,460
Like what the fuck did you
guys do? You know, look,

615
00:36:20,461 --> 00:36:22,350
some of them probably find a
fucking war. Who's kidding who,

616
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,540
but I'm just saying generally
speaking, you know what I mean? I know.

617
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:28,500
Maybe we should give them a break, dude.
They didn't all fight a fucking war,

618
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,690
you know what I mean? They weren't all
on the front lines is what I'm saying.

619
00:36:30,691 --> 00:36:33,480
A lot of those people peel the potatoes
and they're still fucking limpet.

620
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,450
That makes no sense.
All right, let me, um,

621
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,100
let me read a little bit of
advertising. You know, it's,

622
00:36:38,101 --> 00:36:42,960
it doesn't that feel and
potatoes there. Um, all right.

00:36:42,961 --> 00:36:46,350

653
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,470
[inaudible] fallen off a fucking
fairy. You go into the water,

654
00:38:30,471 --> 00:38:35,030
your balls are still dry. Along comes
the sting ray puts out your rye,

655
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,720
but you could've died
like the crocodile hunter.

656
00:38:37,721 --> 00:38:42,490
I bet he was aware of me undies
when he got stabbed there. Sorry.

657
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,510
Sorry. Australia. Mandy's.

658
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,670
Picture a world where putting on a new
pair of underwear isn't just fresh.

659
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:51,100
You're stepping into a
better day. Think about it.

660
00:38:51,101 --> 00:38:53,980
Underwear is the first thing you put
on in the last thing you take off.

661
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:59,470
Unless you're fucking weird, right? No.

662
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:02,020
You know what? You have a G. I'm
not gonna say that. You know what?

663
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,360
If you really have to just take
a shit and you just fucking like,

664
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:09,140
you have to shit so bad, you bypass on
doing your belt and undoing your pants.

665
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:13,000
You just fucking, you know, you give you,
you give yourself the old right there,

666
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,380
Fred Yank and it all down.
You know that's not true.

667
00:39:17,381 --> 00:39:20,110
Most most people when they get
arrested, only thing they have on,

668
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,480
you know that's not true.
You don't have a shirt.

669
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,160
There has been times when you just
have on a tee shirt, isn't it? Anyways,

670
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,800
why would you settle for anything less
than the best feeling underwear on the

671
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:33,490
planet? Well, because maybe, yeah, you
have different priorities. I don't know.

672
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:36,640
Please include the following points
during your read. Well, if you write it,

673
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,750

676
00:39:42,161 --> 00:39:46,060
My friends at me on these sent me a
few pairs a while back and now I can't

677
00:39:46,061 --> 00:39:49,510
imagine wearing anything else. It

mouth. Yeah, they're comfortable,

679

fucking a little racy for me.

left. Can you hang in there? All right.

698
00:40:58,001 --> 00:41:02,470
Simply safe, everybody.
Is this a safe place?

699
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:05,200
You're making this not a safe place?

700
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:09,250
I'm going to wear a
safety Pitt. Simply safe.

701
00:41:09,251 --> 00:41:12,440
Ever find yourself almost all the
way to work or maybe you're out.

702
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:16,420
You're out with your family and friends
and you get that nagging failing.

703
00:41:16,421 --> 00:41:19,780
Did I close the window?
Did I lock that door?

704
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,320
Why did I fuck the maid?
Why did I fuck them?

705
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,570
The kids go through look like me. I'm
sorry. It's a Schwartzenegger reference.

706
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:31,780
You just don't know. It can
drive you nuts there. Well,

707

you don't have to worry about it when
you simply safe home security. Well,

708
00:41:34,881 --> 00:41:38,060
if you left the fucking window open,
you can set the, well, I get it.

709
00:41:38,061 --> 00:41:41,690
You can't set the alarm. Okay. It's a
nice extra layer of protection to know.

710
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,070
Simply safe is there.

711
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:47,480

no hidden fees. They won't Gouge.

companies charge and about $150 less

717
00:42:06,081 --> 00:42:09,590
than I paid for a fucking movie ticket
today. And here's some big news.

new high definition security camera.

know what's great about that?

720
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,040
You can actually see the
criminals face, you know,

721
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:24,020

out, you can actually look and be like,

722
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:27,950

MVMT watches pronounced movement was
founded on the belief that style shouldn't

737
00:43:16,311 --> 00:43:20,180
break the bank. Yeah, you should listen
to this. Yeah. What they just said.

738
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,080
This means you spent too much fucking
money. You know exactly what it means.

739
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:29,150
Don't play dumb with me. What
you call me in here to attack me.

740
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:32,640
I was like, why? You can
create the advertising thing.

741
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,750
I was going to come back when
you're done. Yeah. And I subtly,

742
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:39,180
sure I suddenly gave you shit and then
you pulled the emergency breaking down.

743
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:43,310
Here we are. Okay.
Everybody knows once again,

744
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:47,090
style shouldn't break the bank.

745
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,430
Um,

746
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:53,030

what's the score to the game yet?
That watch that I have, by the way.

767
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:13,770
[inaudible] I didn't say you did.

768
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:18,270
He just taken the bait and Iam just
breaking your fucking ovaries over there.

769
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,990
Um, what does this go to the fucking
game. I'll just show him the highlights.

770
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,810
All right. Hey there. Billy clairvoyant a.

771
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,570
You probably didn't notice this because
I doubt you'll you listen back to your

772
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:30,450
own podcasts, but there have
been throwback parallels.

773
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:33,330
I actually listened to my podcast is
I uploaded my just listening to him.

774
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:38,400
You know, I don't know why I do. He
loves the sound of his own voice.

775
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,340
Um, that's not true.
I've learned to love it.

776
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,830
When you first hear your own
voice, you don't like it.

777
00:45:43,831 --> 00:45:46,310
Now I can't live without it. Um,

778
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:50,430
I walk around with headphones in my
house just listening to my own podcast.

779
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:56,010
When Andrew cuts together the clips, he
uses the same date from eight years ago.

780
00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:00,180
Last Thursday was from November 17th,
2008. Oh, he told me he does that.

781
00:46:00,181 --> 00:46:03,810
That's cool. He said in that episode
you made a reference to cash cab,

782
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:08,040
which was hosting, which was
hosted by your guests this week,

783
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:11,880
Ben Bailey also a couple of weeks
ago when you first mentioned watching

784
00:46:11,881 --> 00:46:12,714
Westworld,

785
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,620
the throw back clip had you mentioned
the original Westworld once again,

786
00:46:16,621 --> 00:46:18,960
eight years ago to the, to
the day. Yeah, that back then.

787
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,080
That's what I wanted to buy the rights
to it until I realized it was zillions of

788
00:46:22,081 --> 00:46:25,050
dollars and I was like, oh, forget it.

789
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:30,840
Bye Bye everybody. And Oh, I had it. My
whole representation, all excited. Like,

790
00:46:30,841 --> 00:46:33,540
is he going to do something like
this? We can get a piece of this.

791
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:36,840
And I was like, oh, that's
too much money. Um, he said,

792
00:46:36,841 --> 00:46:40,800
I'll be on the lookout for more of these
and hopes to exploit your magic. Love.

793
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:46,320
You Love Nia. Well that's all. Love
you too, boo. That's all due to,

794
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,990
um, what's his face? Uh, Andrew.

795
00:46:48,991 --> 00:46:51,540
Andrew like I think he tries
to find like the parallel,

796
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,860
so that's his homework, not mine.
All right. Thanksgiving recipe a.

797
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:01,730
They are Billy White meat and I'm
like that Billy White Meat Burger.

798
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:06,330
The other white meat, the other
white meat. A, the Billy White meat.

799
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:06,841
Uh,

800
00:47:06,841 --> 00:47:10,080
what are you going to teach us to cook
this year if I don't get another cooking

801
00:47:10,081 --> 00:47:13,800
video? Like the pie crust masterpiece.
I'm boycotting the season.

802
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:16,920
I'm the single one of my siblings.

803
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:20,670
And last year I showed up with the pie
and waited till everyone was done to let

804
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:21,570
them know I made it.

805
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:26,100
Then I showed them your Wii video and
we had some full fully belly, less full,

806
00:47:26,101 --> 00:47:30,190
I think full belly labs is what you
want to say. Don't let me make a,

807
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,200
don't let me make, let my family down.

808
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:35,740
Don't let me let my family down
by letting me down. Okay. God,

809
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:39,990
thanks for all the free labs. I'm
hearing you get through that set.

810
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:41,523
I know

811
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:46,120
my eyes are always 10 words ahead
of what I can fucking remember.

812
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:49,860
I think that's what happens.
So maybe I'm just dumb. Um,

813
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,770
it's going to be sad when a kid's a better
reader than me. Fucking six months in

814
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:57,880
her baby's going to teach you how to read.

815
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:02,650
I'm gonna read you a book at my house
whenever I bought read to like my nieces

816
00:48:02,651 --> 00:48:03,251
and nephews,

817
00:48:03,251 --> 00:48:06,040
like there's a point when they stopped
looking at the book and they just turn

818
00:48:06,041 --> 00:48:09,760
around and look at me and then it's like
more pressure on him and I'm literally

819
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:14,260
reading like the rabbit
goes, hop, hop, hop, hop.

820
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:18,220
It doesn't go hop it,
it hops. A cow goes moo.

821
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,990
And maybe that helps you out
there. Fucking old and bald. Um,

822
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:26,870
well I feel like last year
like making a pie crust,

823
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,690
it was like a real fucking
skill that I had. Like,

824
00:48:28,691 --> 00:48:32,890
I dunno what else to show you
guys how to make, um, you know,

825
00:48:32,891 --> 00:48:36,820
if Nia lets me get this fucking
griddle that I want to get, Oh my God,

826
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:39,730
this is great. Oh my God,
that's fucking griddle.

827
00:48:39,731 --> 00:48:42,310
It's like you love when I Cook, but
you don't want, you don't wanna.

828
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:44,440
You know what I mean? It's
like you like your freedom,

829
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:47,890
but you don't want to see how it
happens. You're the same way with food.

830
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:51,280
You know touchdown fucking
Redskins. God dammit,

831
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:53,580
because I don't what? What
are you trying to do here?

832
00:48:53,581 --> 00:48:57,480
You're trying to get like every fucking
invention that has to do with cooking or

833
00:48:57,481 --> 00:49:02,340
grilling or smoking or frying. You
want to buy it and it's just like,

834
00:49:02,341 --> 00:49:04,290
where are we gonna put
all this shit? Okay,

835
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:08,970
let's list all the shit that I've bought.
I'm not saying that you bought it all.

836
00:49:08,971 --> 00:49:10,330
I'm saying that you want to buy it.

837
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,360
Why? I do want to buy it all
and why haven't I bought it all?

838
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:18,230
Because there's no room for it.
Oh, and who determined that?

839
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,590
I mean, oh, another missed extra point.

840
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:29,050
Who determined that? Nia. I, you decided
that? I thought it was a mutual. Yep.

841
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:33,940
It wasn't all right. A buddy of mine
was going to hook me up with this.

842
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,700
Woke up pellet smoker, you said? No.

843
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:40,460
Well because he tried to act like
he told me it was the size of a,

844
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:44,690
of a typewriter. Then would be a solid,
and when he actually showed it to me,

845
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:47,540
he was like, come here, let me show
you. Let me show you what it looks like.

846
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:50,780
And then I looked at it and I'm
like, and what Universe is this?

847
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:53,880
The size of a typewriter,
the size of a roof? I said,

848
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:56,480
it's like a sewing machine.
He goes, oh yeah, yeah.

849
00:49:56,481 --> 00:49:59,510
It's more like a sewing machine. I'm
like, a sewing machine is on a typewriter.

850
00:49:59,640 --> 00:49:59,780
Can I

851
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:02,390
tell you something there?
That's why guys are great.

852
00:50:02,391 --> 00:50:06,380
That's why I love that dude
forever because you know
we do that for each other.

853
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:10,200
I don't know if women do. I want to
speak for you guys, but guys do that.

854
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,390
It was a sight. It's the size of a wallet.

855
00:50:12,391 --> 00:50:16,420
You need a kitchen the size of his
kitchen in order to do all the things that

856
00:50:16,421 --> 00:50:17,254
you want to do.

857
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:22,390
It's a kitchen. It's a portable thing.
It's on fucking wheels. It's in the back,

858
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:26,110
but we've got like three fucking tables
in the backyard and I can't get rid of

859
00:50:26,111 --> 00:50:28,370
any of those tables for
the fucking potato salad.

860
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:33,780
You know every piece of furniture I put
in the back yard has a function and we

861
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:34,740
have used it

862
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:36,410
in that

863
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:39,290
function. That doesn't make any
sense. But she doesn't mean no.

864
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,120
You're what you're doing and she,

865
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:45,050
you've become the dictator or the
fucking backyard. Mm. You're the woman.

866
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:48,230
I own the backyard. I own the
fucking garage. If we had a basement,

867
00:50:48,231 --> 00:50:50,540
that's my shit. You can have
the rest of the fucking house.

868
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:54,420
All right, so what are you saying?

869
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:56,850
I'm saying I'm getting that griddle. Okay.

870
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:05,060
All right. [inaudible]
oh Jesus Christ. Yeah,

871
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,880
you're going to hear me say that until
I fucking make you a nice fucking steak

872
00:51:07,881 --> 00:51:11,840
and cheese or make some hash browns
or make you a grand slam breakfast.

873
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,650
I've got my fuckings, I've got my fucken.

874
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:17,750
You've been making all of those things
without the grill cause I may need to

875
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:19,820
guide. Right. So why exactly.

876
00:51:19,821 --> 00:51:23,150
So what do you need all this other
stuff for if you're so talented?

877
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,730
Because just imagine how good it would
taste if I actually had a fucking

878
00:51:25,731 --> 00:51:30,150
griddle. Even those fucking
stoves that have a griddle,

879
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:34,050
if the thing sucks because it's
one heat source, so you can't,

880
00:51:34,051 --> 00:51:37,050
you can't have deficiency. Can't move
it around. You can't play with you heat.

881
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:40,980
It sucks. It's like this
is the temperature. It's
a pain in the fucking ass.

882
00:51:40,981 --> 00:51:44,000
It's one thing if you've got a pot or
a pan, you can take it on the heat.

883
00:51:44,001 --> 00:51:45,990
Take it off. When you're
on your fucking griddle,

884
00:51:45,991 --> 00:51:48,600
you know you want one on one off
and maybe one a little bit on.

885
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,770
Why don't you just get one of those
little electric griddles at the little,

886
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:56,550
the one my freshman in college. Once
you can put on your counter, well,

887
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,120
when you divorce me. Oh, that's
too sad to say if you ever do that.

888
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:03,470
Do you ever do that and I'll [inaudible].

889
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:07,230
It's a grown fucking man to
buy divorcee kitchen products.

890
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,130
Fuck. Are you talking about divorce? Yeah.

891
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,400
I'll go to McDonald's and grab some extra
packets of ketchup for the future when

892
00:52:14,401 --> 00:52:19,200
I need more ketchup. I've done all
that. Nia. I've used shares for tables,

893
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:22,180
eight pasta all fucking day and
pancakes. I've done all that. Yes,

894
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:26,160
I'm done this, we know. Yeah. Yeah, you'll
use sick and my self made man, shit,

895
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:27,480
it annoys you, doesn't it?

896
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:31,800
I would eat spaghetti with prego and,

897
00:52:31,801 --> 00:52:35,520
and the bread because it will fill
me up and it will last me all nights.

898
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:40,050
I do all my spots and I would eat pancakes
because it kept me the most full when

899
00:52:40,051 --> 00:52:41,130
I me up like cement.

900
00:52:41,131 --> 00:52:43,890
And you don't want him doing that
for the fucking people out there.

901
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,180
Women included.

902
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:49,080
Go on and be one to fucking make something
happen and food's a big thing cause

903
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:50,700
you got to fucking have it every day.

904
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:53,340
So you gotta have that shit that
fills you up, right? Listen,

905
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,730
don't let this little ray of Sunshine
fucking rain on your parade. Okay,

906
00:52:56,790 --> 00:53:01,140
I'm here for all you guys.
I'm the positive guy. I'm
the motivational speaker.

907
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,650
Hey, speaking of motivational, what the
fuck's going on with the PNID ex guy?

908
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:08,700
Did he become a Vegan or something? Well
first of all, he's not to P90x anymore.

909
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,600
He's got a different thing late
night. Yeah. Yeah. But now Tony Horny,

910
00:53:12,601 --> 00:53:14,910
he's looking a little like he's
not doing his pull ups anymore.

911
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,050
He's getting older. He's looking like, um,

912
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,090
I dunno. He's looking
all veggie. Hmm. Anyways,

913
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:26,040
so I don't what I'm
going to make this year.

914
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:31,690
I told you. Oh, you mean for
the people? For this guy. Yeah.

915
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,441
Yeah. You want me to,

916
00:53:32,441 --> 00:53:36,100
I'm not showing my fam secret family
fucking recipe of the best stuffing you're

917
00:53:36,101 --> 00:53:37,140
ever gonna have. Admit it.

918
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:41,650
Most people stuffing fucking
sucks stuffing that bill makes.

919
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:44,350
Oh my God. It's so delicious.
I've never had good stuff.

920
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,050
The only stuffing I've ever
had that even like me too.

921
00:53:47,110 --> 00:53:48,870
I don't ever like stuffing. I don't roast.

922
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,870
It's always wet and it already
has a bad aftertaste. Yeah.

923
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,740
This is nice and crispy and like buttery.
Oh, it's so good. Yeah. When you got,

924
00:53:56,741 --> 00:54:00,100
you got that fucking barbecue the other
night. You didn't like the corn bread.

925
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:01,690
They put that weird
ingredient in there. Yeah.

926
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:05,090
Ah, fumble

927
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:09,130
you so and so. Read
another question. Dammit.

928
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:10,703
Okay.

929
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,670
When the fuck did I become such a package
fan? This just certain old NFL teams.

930
00:54:14,671 --> 00:54:15,900
I like actually like the giants.

931
00:54:15,901 --> 00:54:20,060
Can you fucking believe that if the
what they did to my patriots twice, um,

932
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:25,590
one flew over the cuckoo's nest.
Alright. Hey, they're all Billy bibbet.

933
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:30,450
Um, it's funny who's Bibbet is a character
in one flew over the cuckoo's nest.

934
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:31,883
Oh Shit.

935
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,003
Okay.

936
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:38,370
What's his face downstairs here and old
friend of mine has gone so far down the

937
00:54:38,371 --> 00:54:42,870
rabbit hole of conspiracy theories that
he really can't even function in society

938
00:54:42,871 --> 00:54:47,160
anymore. Oh, that's relatable.
Tell him to start telling jokes.

939
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:48,150
He's,

940
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:53,150
he is unable to hold a conversation for
two minutes without going off on some

941
00:54:53,341 --> 00:54:57,300
rambling horse shit about
chem trails, Freemasons,

942
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:59,070
aliens and all of that crap.

943
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:03,360
Completely oblivious to the fact that
none of us are interested in hearing about

944
00:55:03,361 --> 00:55:07,170
all that nonsense he reads on the
Internet. It used to be funny,

945
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,150
we were driving out west a few years
back and he pointed out at some lights

946
00:55:12,151 --> 00:55:16,560
moving up in the sky and said, those
are the aliens that follow me around.

947
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:19,710
Oh, this sounds like a
mental issue, dude. I said,

948
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:23,820
what does that sign on the right set?
He said, airport neck size cause it.

949
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:28,110
And I said, yeah, those are airplanes
you check. Yes. And he said,

950
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,860
well maybe some of them.
Wow. He goes, okay,

951
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:35,430
it's been over a decade of that
kind of Shit. And it's gotten way,

952
00:55:35,431 --> 00:55:39,180
way worse because of this obsession
and the resulting paranoia.

953
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:41,290
He can't even hold down a menial job.

954
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:43,890
And all of his friends
have abandoned ship.

955
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:48,400
He has become addicted to painkillers.
I think he already had a mental issue,

956
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,500
man. Yeah, of course.

957
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:53,040
Has Been in and out of rehab centers
in hospitals because of bizarre health

958
00:55:53,041 --> 00:55:56,070
problems and is now bordering
on full blown schizophrenia.

959
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:59,130
Well you don't get that from
reading conspiracy theory, sir.

960
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:03,060
He kinda did a fucking bait
and switch with that question,

961
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:06,090
that whole thing in the beginning,
which is like a red herring.

962
00:56:06,091 --> 00:56:08,520
It turns out he's got like
serious mental problems.

963
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:12,290
What's a red herring? It's just,
it's just a distraction. Exactly.

964
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:13,880
It's something that you think is

965
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:18,450
the cause of, you know, I'm not gonna
explain it right, cause I'm tired,

966
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,433
but

967
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:23,120
oh, I got to use that excuse sometimes
when I use an expression that, oh,

968
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:23,980
where's my

969
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:28,560
brain? My brain is mush. Oh Christ.

970
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,700
How many points does fucking Aaron
Rogers gotta put up? You know,

971
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,000
it's like Tom Brady, same thing. How
many fucking points did you get a score?

972
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:37,910
You just gotta you know, defense. Um,

973
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,940
I want to respect his right to
believe what he wants to believe.

974
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,930
But in the end it has only caused him
to lead an increasingly miserable and

975
00:56:45,931 --> 00:56:50,220
lonely life that will end in a tragedy
and a sparsely attended funeral unless

976
00:56:50,221 --> 00:56:51,510
something changes soon.

977
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:55,410
So how the fuck do you bring someone
back from so far over the edge? Okay,

978
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,270
well he might be exaggerated
a little bit with the,

979
00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:02,100
maybe he's using schizophrenia as
like a fucking filler word there.

980
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,980
Like, you know, this guy isn't
narcissists. This guy's a sociopath.

981
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:08,500
This sounds like paranoid schizophrenia.
This is exactly, oh, Dr. Hill.

982
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,550
Are you going to diagnose
that on this fucking one?

983
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:13,380
If she written fucking
email? Unfortunately,

984
00:57:13,381 --> 00:57:15,930
a member of my family who
went through this exact thing.

985
00:57:15,931 --> 00:57:19,620
I do feel that I recognize it a little
bit. Yes. As a matter of fact, I do.

986
00:57:19,710 --> 00:57:20,041
Okay,

987
00:57:20,041 --> 00:57:24,030
but do you feel like that you can make
that diagnosis as someone who is not a

988
00:57:24,031 --> 00:57:25,530
doctor? No, of course not.

989
00:57:25,531 --> 00:57:30,531
A comedian is not even a podcaster that
you can on a podcast done by a comedian

990
00:57:31,771 --> 00:57:32,730
as not a doctor.

991
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,170
Diagnose this person that you've never
met based on this four paragraph email to

992
00:57:37,171 --> 00:57:40,530
come in here. So I'm giving my opinion.
Either you're going to start a song,

993
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:45,630
you ask me to come here.

994
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:49,140
Are you annoyed that that lady
singing about all the ingredients,

995
00:57:49,620 --> 00:57:53,160
you get annoyed when black shit goes
fucking mainstream and then white people

996
00:57:53,161 --> 00:57:57,810
ruin it? Well, I got peas,
greens, tomatoes, potatoes.

997
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:58,703
That she,

998
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:00,223
yeah, that thing.

999
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:05,251
I swear to God,

1000
00:58:05,251 --> 00:58:08,850
if that's what my nice little week
long run before everyone else.

1001
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:12,350
If that was my, if that's what
my, which was like I would,

1002
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:15,280
I would go every week. If it was
only a half hour long, I still can't.

1003
00:58:15,281 --> 00:58:16,700
I just can't get into the fucking,

1004
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:20,360
I like to sing and part of black churches.

1005
00:58:20,361 --> 00:58:23,750
But even when the priest,
regardless of race,

1006
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:27,290
when they get up there and they start
saying that this invisible guy gives a

1007
00:58:27,291 --> 00:58:31,920
shit about me, that's, I just, I tap
out. I just can't listen to it anyway.

1008
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:36,940
He wants he cheeses tcis bond chair
that that's the second flat screen

1009
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:40,930
downstairs friend needs per fellows
help. You're not going to be able to,

1010
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:45,610
I let Joel State, he's a, he's a very
positive guy. Um, well you know something,

1011
00:58:45,611 --> 00:58:48,400
he's been out there long enough that you'd
think if there was a scandal it would

1012
00:58:48,401 --> 00:58:52,090
come up by now. Right. Um, this,

1013
00:58:52,091 --> 00:58:55,810
your friend needs professional
help. This is beyond your, um,

1014
00:58:56,770 --> 00:59:00,370
this is beyond your pay grade.
Jesus don't Shit on the guy.

1015
00:59:00,371 --> 00:59:03,460
He might've just been being funny
just because I'm not shitting on him.

1016
00:59:03,461 --> 00:59:04,150
I'm saying that you're,

1017
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:07,930
his friend needs help and this is not
anything that he is qualified to do.

1018
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:13,180
So because he's not much nicer way of
saying the same as beyond your pay grade a

1019
00:59:13,181 --> 00:59:16,240
buddy you don't, you get, don't pick
up your brome and keep sweeping up.

1020
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:22,060
This is the job of people with lab
coats. Um, hold on a second. But what

1021
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:22,400
does he say?

1022
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:27,120
He said like I respect his right to
believe what he wants to believe,

1023
00:59:27,121 --> 00:59:29,040
but in the end that Dah Dah,
Dah, Dah. Yeah, I don't,

1024
00:59:29,041 --> 00:59:32,670
I don't even think he necessarily
maybe even believes, believes it.

1025
00:59:32,671 --> 00:59:35,950
He's just got, yeah, he's,
yeah, he's become a data paying.

1026
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:38,910
Claire's had been in and out of rehab
centers in hospitals because of bizarre

1027
00:59:38,911 --> 00:59:43,350
health problems. Yeah. He is now bordering
on full blown schizophrenia. Yeah.

1028
00:59:43,351 --> 00:59:45,060
I think you just got to be there for him,

1029
00:59:45,061 --> 00:59:48,810
but maybe just check in on them and
say, Hey, are you taking your meds?

1030
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:49,653
Are you going to see her

1031
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:51,720
doctor? That type of thing. But you're,

1032
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:56,070
I don't think you're going to be able
to like help him with this hail on you.

1033
00:59:57,390 --> 01:00:00,540
Is that what I just sounded? Yeah.
You know, it's fucking coolest shit.

1034
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:04,920
The Redskins still have a band and
they actually have a team song.

1035
01:00:04,921 --> 01:00:08,660
I think that's fucking cool.
It's a professional level.

1036
01:00:08,661 --> 01:00:11,870
For some reason that all went away.
I hope our baby doesn't get your add.

1037
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,790
Why it's worked great
for me. Has It? Yeah.

1038
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,640
Yeah, it is. Yeah.

1039
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:26,990
I played drums for helicopters.
Still Chokes you and Amos.

1040
01:00:30,750 --> 01:00:31,583
Okay.

1041
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:36,520
Add is is a fucking great thing to
have. It sucks with some shit, but it's,

1042
01:00:36,850 --> 01:00:39,940
it's, it sucks when you're in school and
you're going to do poorly in school and

1043
01:00:39,941 --> 01:00:43,000
everyone's going to say you're fucking
dumb. But when you get out in the world,

1044
01:00:43,001 --> 01:00:44,380
man, it's fucking tremendous.

1045
01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:46,443
It's tremendous.

1046
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,390
I know I run around all
day long, have a various,

1047
01:00:51,391 --> 01:00:55,490
so you don't have it like severely
though. You weren't able to just fucking,

1048
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:58,600
you just get, you know, even
get the lab glasses on tonight,

1049
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:02,190
just fucking diagnosed at everything.
How do you know what I have at us?

1050
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:08,010
Remember when we tried to do that ADT
questionnaire and you couldn't even pay

1051
01:01:08,011 --> 01:01:12,090
attention long enough
to answer the question.

1052
01:01:12,120 --> 01:01:13,770
You have a part of that was
because I was annoyed with it.

1053
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:18,600
You want to revisit that real quick?
No. Do an Oldie but goodie. All right.

1054
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,310
Built my kid is 14 years old, 14 years
old, and he wants a drone for Christmas.

1055
01:01:23,670 --> 01:01:27,360
The drone market is huge with
kids these days. When I was a kid,

1056
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:29,790
we wanted to fly something
for the sake of flying it.

1057
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:33,570
Now they all have cameras attached to
them and they hover in a real creepy way.

1058
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:36,980
He's not a punk, so he won't
flip out if he doesn't get one.

1059
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,260
His friends have them. So it's
not like he'll eat, never use one.

1060
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:44,520
If I did get him one, he's not the type
of kid to fly it up to someone's window.

1061
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:46,170
So that's not the concern.

1062
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:50,430
I'm coming from a place like if I
didn't want him to get an earring,

1063
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:54,420
uh, more of, don't be that
kid. I might be overreacting,

1064
01:01:54,421 --> 01:01:56,820
but that's just something. But
there's just something about drones.

1065
01:01:56,821 --> 01:02:00,960
What do you think? Uh, congrats
on the condition. Uh, thank you.

1066
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:06,330
Um, I would say, uh, I
agree with you. No drowns,

1067
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,080
no drones with the
cameras. That's too much.

1068
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:10,140
Th the Shit I would have fucking done,

1069
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:12,240
I would have the hottest
chicken in the neighborhood.

1070
01:02:12,241 --> 01:02:15,780
I would've had it out there
hovering, hovering near a bathroom.

1071
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:20,010
[inaudible]

1072
01:02:20,010 --> 01:02:23,040
of course you would. If he's not,
then his friends are going to,

1073
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,830
his friends are going to be like, let's
just take it over here and just see,

1074
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:27,040
and this is a thing, you know,

1075
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:31,100
person watching is jerking
off if it immediately crashes.

1076
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:34,223
So,

1077
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:40,310
so kids are really using drones like
they're, are they, is that the hot gift?

1078
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:41,960
This Christmas is a drone

1079
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:46,900
for a teenager. I mean it's,
it's an amazing fucking thing.

1080
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,310
It really is. I mean,

1081
01:02:48,311 --> 01:02:51,400
I can't imagine like just flying
over a neighborhood to see what your

1082
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:54,880
neighborhood looks like from the air or
your house. All of that would be cool.

1083
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,400
But the, the, the possibilities,

1084
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:01,300
the shit that you could do
with those things, uh, in a,

1085
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:04,420
with a juvenile brain, I don't
know. I would be nervous.

1086
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:08,440
One of the best things my parents did
was they never let us play video games.

1087
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:11,730
They never let us play it. They
just, you're not getting that.

1088
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:13,180
It's going to fuck with
your schoolwork. You know,

1089
01:03:13,181 --> 01:03:14,920
it was funny as I still
fucked up in school,

1090
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:18,820
but the great thing is is I'm
not a fucking 48 year old gamer.

1091
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:23,380
You know, like I just think
that's, that's really like a,

1092
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:28,740
I, I, you know, I kinda judged
that shit like after a while. Like,

1093
01:03:28,741 --> 01:03:31,290
like what are you, what are you
doing? You know what I mean?

1094
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:36,230
What you want to go outside, like
the amount of time that people spent.

1095
01:03:36,231 --> 01:03:39,620
You could learn a language, you could
learn how to play an instrument. This,

1096
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,030
I'm literally doing
whatever you get delta is.

1097
01:03:41,031 --> 01:03:42,950
You could go out and do the
things that I find interesting.

1098
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:44,990
The fuck if you're into video
games, go ahead and play it.

1099
01:03:44,991 --> 01:03:47,960
But I'm glad that I didn't cause I wasted
enough time watching fucking sports.

1100
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:50,510
I can't imagine, cause I told you,

1101
01:03:50,511 --> 01:03:53,150
I've always said I tapped out
after grand theft auto three.

1102
01:03:53,151 --> 01:03:54,170
It literally took over my life.

1103
01:03:54,171 --> 01:03:58,730
I'm so sick of this fucking commercial
where they show the Ford F-150 with the

1104
01:03:58,731 --> 01:04:00,440
aluminum bed and it has,

1105
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:04,580
it doesn't have any bedliner and they
dropped the fucking toolbox into it and

1106
01:04:04,581 --> 01:04:06,500
then they showed the
Chevy with the steel one.

1107
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:09,760
This is such bullshit
advertising. What it's really is,

1108
01:04:09,761 --> 01:04:13,310
is I bet the Ford gets better gas mileage
because it has a lighter bed and then

1109
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:16,730
all you do is just put that to the same
rubber guard that comes in all pickup

1110
01:04:16,731 --> 01:04:17,031
trucks.

1111
01:04:17,031 --> 01:04:19,850
What kind of a fucking asshole buys
a pickup truck and you don't have the

1112
01:04:19,851 --> 01:04:22,460
bedliner the fuck outta here. Fuck Chevy.

1113
01:04:23,510 --> 01:04:26,480
Even though I like this Silverado.
All right. Thanksgiving debacle.

1114
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:28,820
Old Billy Turkey legs.

1115
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:33,740
Don't get your kid a drone if you don't
want them to have the drone. You're the,

1116
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:36,250
you're the parent. Alright. What's that?

1117
01:04:36,251 --> 01:04:39,530
Another add moment that I'd leave it
there. I'm going a little debacle with

1118
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,710
lady

1119
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:45,840
about Thanksgiving. I want my
girl to come to my thanksgiving,

1120
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:49,560
but it starts like only
an hour before hers.

1121
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:51,420
Okay.

1122
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,540
Right. I'm in a little bit of a
Dabbagh for my lady about Thanksgiving.

1123
01:04:53,541 --> 01:04:55,670
I want my girl to come to my thanksgiving,

1124
01:04:55,671 --> 01:04:59,750
but it starts only an hour before hers,
but they are in the same time town.

1125
01:04:59,751 --> 01:05:02,960
Mind you, mine's at my aunt's
house and hers is at our parents.

1126
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:07,220
Mine starts at 12 hers starts at one
30 I wanted her to come to mind for a

1127
01:05:07,221 --> 01:05:08,660
little bit before hers,

1128
01:05:08,661 --> 01:05:13,190
but she's not having it because
she's got to help her mom cook. Well,

1129
01:05:13,191 --> 01:05:13,761
this is easy,

1130
01:05:13,761 --> 01:05:16,540
so you just say you'll be over there and
fucking one 30 and you're just going to

1131
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:18,110
make an appearance,
which you can make it not

1132
01:05:18,110 --> 01:05:21,280
see your family on thanksgiving.
He said, on one hand,

1133
01:05:21,281 --> 01:05:25,300
I'm super salty and want to be a huge
and want to make a huge deal about this

1134
01:05:25,301 --> 01:05:28,570
because I really want her there
and I think she's being selfish,

1135
01:05:28,571 --> 01:05:31,900
but on the other hand, I understand
she's got to help her mom cook and stuff.

1136
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,380
At least that's her excuse.
I know she loves her family,

1137
01:05:35,381 --> 01:05:38,440
but it really pisses me off because
she's never been to my family shit.

1138
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:41,650
But I've got gone. I've
gone to plenty of hers.

1139
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:46,090
Hers offense is that she's never made me
miss any of my family gatherings to go

1140
01:05:46,091 --> 01:05:50,650
to hers. But my family is a bunch
of nut jobs and you get the point.

1141
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:55,300
A old Billy burnt Dick. I
could use some words of wisdom.

1142
01:05:55,820 --> 01:06:00,370
I'm a huge fan. Thanks. And Go fuck
yourself. Happy holidays. Huge Fan. Well,

1143
01:06:00,371 --> 01:06:05,371
I mean this is all your doing
so you can undo all of this.

1144
01:06:06,110 --> 01:06:06,943
All right.

1145
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:08,190
Yeah.

1146
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:10,970
You know, you just got to put your foot
down and just say, listen, I respect,

1147
01:06:10,971 --> 01:06:13,130
I understand you got to help you
mother cook. But I, you know,

1148
01:06:13,131 --> 01:06:16,010
I want to see my aunt, my family on
Thanksgiving. So I will go over there.

1149
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:19,040
I'll be there over the
for an hour. All right.

1150
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:21,440
And then I'll be over here
at one 30 in time to eat.

1151
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:25,250
And if she has a problem with that, um,

1152
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:31,000
just ask her why do you have a problem
with that? This is perfect. I'll, I'll,

1153
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:35,990
you don't have, you don't have to
come, you don't have to come to, to,

1154
01:06:36,470 --> 01:06:41,240
uh, my family of nutjobs as you say. And,

1155
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:42,823
uh,

1156
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:43,330
yeah,

1157
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:47,700
she tried to get out of going to your
families is what I'm wondering because

1158
01:06:47,701 --> 01:06:50,430
most people, I feel like in the
situation, you just split it up.

1159
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:53,100
So she's got to go help her family cook.

1160
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,633
Okay.

1161
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:59,190
You could go over there with
her while they're doing that.

1162
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:01,380
Talk to the dad of the brothers, whatever.

1163
01:07:01,381 --> 01:07:04,590
I don't know if they're going to be
cooking or whatever. Spend that time,

1164
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:08,550
have the meal and then the
two of you then go to your,

1165
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:13,350
your family's house for dessert and
like coffee and a movie or game night or

1166
01:07:13,351 --> 01:07:14,230
whatever. Yeah.

1167
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:18,370
There's his starts early. It starts at
12 there starts at one 30. So I'm saying,

1168
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:21,280
I just, I tell, listen, you go
over to your mom's house, you cook.

1169
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:25,660
I'm going to all my aunts from 12 to
one I'll be back at one 30 show up like,

1170
01:07:25,661 --> 01:07:27,490
and then you show up at like one 40.

1171
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,510
You don't even have to spend like
an hour though. That's nothing.

1172
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:32,730
Hm.

1173
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:35,760
He goes, you'd like the food isn't
going on the table right at swell.

1174
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:40,920
Everyone's going to like saunter in
around 1230, 1245 sit down then eat.

1175
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:42,120
I would take, it's going to be there.

1176
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,910
This, this is what I would do.
I would say this is the deal.

1177
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:48,020
I'm going in there for an hour, then
I'm gonna go over to one 30, right?

1178
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:50,820
One 30 I'll be at your place, but
next year we're going to my families.

1179
01:07:51,470 --> 01:07:52,740
This isn't like,

1180
01:07:52,741 --> 01:07:55,910
I'm not going to like never see my
family on Thanksgiving again. Right.

1181
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,720
I would never do that to you. I,

1182
01:07:57,721 --> 01:08:00,240
you saying I can't see my
family anymore on thanksgiving.

1183
01:08:01,750 --> 01:08:04,400
Let's just go, yeah, go to his
family's and just say, Hey,

1184
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:09,050
text me when you guys are about to like
sit down because she's going to cook and

1185
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:10,070
do all this other stuff.

1186
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:12,740
So it was like texting me when
you guys are about to sit down,

1187
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:16,100
I'll let you know where I'm at
with my dinner and then I'll just

1188
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,180
come over there and that's,

1189
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:22,010
what do you need to do is say it
totally calmly do not trasher do not,

1190
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:27,050
do not insult. Say anything insulting
about her family. Do not let her, uh,

1191
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:28,610
when and when you stay calm,

1192
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:32,300
if she does that thing where she
then tries to bait you into a fight,

1193
01:08:32,301 --> 01:08:36,980
do not take the bait. Just ask
her why she's reacting that way.

1194
01:08:36,981 --> 01:08:39,320
Or just just stay calm.

1195
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:43,520
Stay on target star wars. Right. You just,

1196
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:46,970
you just make your points and that's
it. Yeah, that sounds reasonable.

1197
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:50,750
Well there you go. So you like how
great a move you is Casablanca.

1198
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,810
And it was really nice. I finally
understood the fucking movie.

1199
01:08:53,811 --> 01:08:55,550
I always got confused. I
understood the love story,

1200
01:08:55,551 --> 01:08:58,040
but I didn't quite understand, you know,

1201
01:08:58,070 --> 01:09:02,570
unoccupied France and the talking
and like Nazi Germany and shit.

1202
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:04,760
It's just like they're taking over
your country and it's just like,

1203
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:07,190
I guess they hadn't, their power hadn't

1204
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:12,200
gotten to that point cause it
was like Italians soldiers there.

1205
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:16,700
There was German soldiers and there was
fucking these, these German Nazi guys.

1206
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:18,530
I don't know.

1207
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:21,200
I'll have to watch it again and maybe
read a little bit of fucking history,

1208
01:09:21,201 --> 01:09:24,080
but I actually understood the love
story this time. It was fucking great.

1209
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:27,440
How beautiful was that woman too,
Huh? Yeah, she's beautiful. Yeah,

1210
01:09:27,500 --> 01:09:30,740
she was like modern day. Beautiful too.
A lot of them back then or back then.

1211
01:09:30,741 --> 01:09:32,720
Beautiful. You know
what I mean? Like, Hey,

1212
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:37,700
what he say they're fucking
Ellis island. She's a classic.

1213
01:09:37,940 --> 01:09:41,660
Uh, ah, there she goes. There you go.

1214
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:46,280
Sleeping like a damn dog lately
because of your condition.

1215
01:09:46,281 --> 01:09:47,630
Because of my condition.

1216
01:09:49,970 --> 01:09:51,920
I think you're being a
jerk about it. Personally.

1217
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,000
I think you're being a jerk about it.
I'm not. How, why is my fucking leg hurt?

1218
01:09:56,030 --> 01:09:56,990
Oh my God. I'm an analyst.

1219
01:09:56,991 --> 01:10:00,220
Those fucking people in the
orchestra pit just will fucking Lisa.

1220
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:02,270
That one guy was like
55 just sitting there.

1221
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:05,150
He looked like he just
fell off a motorcycle.

1222
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:12,410
Um, anyways. Well I'm glad you had a good
time. I hope you enjoy it because uh,

1223
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:16,640
I'm watching all the rest of the football
Sundays from here on out is I empty

1224
01:10:16,641 --> 01:10:21,080
the liquor cabinet. So it that our last
Sunday out. Is that what you're saying?

1225
01:10:21,081 --> 01:10:23,840
Until now I would like to do
that. I'm going to actually,

1226
01:10:23,841 --> 01:10:27,590
and I've been looking up museums and
shit on the download trying to understand

1227
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:32,270
arteries. I never understood it
and I find that I, I like, uh,

1228
01:10:33,350 --> 01:10:36,680
uh, I forget what period it is. It's the
van Gogh in the period out to van Gogh.

1229
01:10:36,681 --> 01:10:40,460
I liked that shit. That's
cool. I liked that abstract.

1230
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,730
I'm starting to understand that.
What? You don't need lines,

1231
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,900
you have colors to suggest moods.
It's like, all right, let's get shit.

1232
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:50,390
I know it looks like a five-year-old.

1233
01:10:50,391 --> 01:10:51,770
It's always going to look
like a five-year-old.

1234
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:56,600
Didn't see like modern art do you think
or do you like them more old classic

1235
01:10:56,601 --> 01:11:00,320
stuff. Uh, like the van Gogh versus

1236
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,430
the Jeff Koons. I don't know
who. Jeff criminals. Andy Warhol.

1237
01:11:05,210 --> 01:11:09,980
Andy Warhol was the original hipster is
brutally, brutally fucking overrated.

1238
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:14,040
Oh, hot take and was not a nice
person. And what [inaudible]

1239
01:11:14,070 --> 01:11:17,620
did you like? Basket? I like
basket. What's that to do?

1240
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:19,440
Looks like saving and
Glover. But he painted

1241
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,500
safe young Glover. Wow. Oh my God.

1242
01:11:25,501 --> 01:11:28,500
I haven't heard that name
in awhile. Uh, yeah. Seed.

1243
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:31,200
Sorta like the weekend
before he cut his hair,

1244
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:33,670
he was doing like an homage
to basket. Yeah. Yes. That's

1245
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:39,390
John Michelle a basket yet. That's the
most modern person I listened to. Yeah,

1246
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:43,820
to the point I preordered his
next album. I know I love,

1247
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:48,390
I got the first two songs
either I want to hear it. Oh,

1248
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,460
you should listen to it
after this. Absolutely.

1249
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,800
As I fall asleep because of my condition.

1250
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:56,160
How far are we talking about my
condition? Not that much. Right.

1251
01:11:56,730 --> 01:12:00,270
What do you mean? Like we're not going
to get into all like all the specifics.

1252
01:12:00,271 --> 01:12:05,010
No, we're not. I'm just something
the sex and all that pictures. No,

1253
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:07,170
none of that shit. It's
just like the kitchen.

1254
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:09,210
You just got to know what got read down.

1255
01:12:10,770 --> 01:12:12,800
Just know that I share enough.

1256
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,350
There's too many fucking Weirdos
on the fucking Internet. I don't,

1257
01:12:16,351 --> 01:12:21,030
I do not understand people that post
pictures of their children, you know,

1258
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:24,540
because you get excited because there's
fucking hallway address right above your

1259
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:25,374
fucking head for the,

1260
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:29,640
for the family photo because they're so
cute and you just want to like show off,

1261
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:30,503
you know.

1262
01:12:30,990 --> 01:12:34,980
But I definitely understand
why we will not be doing that.

1263
01:12:35,650 --> 01:12:36,121
All right.

1264
01:12:36,121 --> 01:12:39,240
This is probably a conversation that
should have happened off of the podcast.

1265
01:12:39,710 --> 01:12:42,600
All right. You're fucking cool. And um,

1266
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:47,670
what the fuck did I do to my leg?

1267
01:12:47,671 --> 01:12:50,210
I just laid down and I feel
like I hyper extended my knee.

1268
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:57,800
Who is it that comedian?

1269
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:04,140
What's his name? You always
bring him up, Richard.

1270
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:08,970
Can't I know. Uh Oh. Robert
Klein. Robert Gla, Robert Klein.

1271
01:13:08,971 --> 01:13:11,090
I can't stop my look.
Very good. Look at you.

1272
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:16,110
[inaudible] saving Glover and you hit me
back. White style little Robert Klein.

1273
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:19,800
All right, that's the podcast for
this week. Go fuck yourselves.

1274
01:13:19,950 --> 01:13:24,510
Have a wonderful Thanksgiving and I will
be checking in on you on Thanksgiving.

1275
01:13:24,511 --> 01:13:27,840
No, you will not so well.
No, you will not. Listen,

1276
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:29,490
we're going to eat at one 30.

1277
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:33,580
I'm going to do a podcast at 12
at my parents' house. You can't,

1278
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:38,250
you can take things giving
off. People understand. Yeah.

1279
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,530
I believe you or people
said money never sleeps

1280
01:13:42,070 --> 01:13:46,620
in 24, seven. What are some of
that stupid shit? They sleep.

1281
01:13:46,621 --> 01:13:50,350
We grind. Yeah. I'll let dumb shit like,

1282
01:13:51,450 --> 01:13:54,810
like Bill Gates isn't doing that. You're
going to do a podcast on Thanksgiving,

1283
01:13:54,811 --> 01:13:58,830
what is wrong with you? Or maybe you'll
do it the day before thanksgiving.

1284
01:13:59,170 --> 01:14:02,490
That's a big pet peeve of
mine when performers over
talk about how fucking hard

1285
01:14:02,491 --> 01:14:05,200
they work, you know, and they take
those pictures of them where they look,

1286
01:14:05,201 --> 01:14:08,280
they've got their head down like
they're fucking exhausted, you know,

1287
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:12,460
and then you just, at least to
these fucking and pose compliments,

1288
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:16,450
you know, lot of people would stop.
I feel like I'm just beginning.

1289
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:19,930
But that's essentially what you're doing.

1290
01:14:19,931 --> 01:14:24,040
If you're going to be working
on thanksgiving. No, no, no.

1291
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:26,410
That was a really weak way
to try to manipulate it back.

1292
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:29,470
And now I'm going to do it. So if you
just want to have the argument now,

1293
01:14:29,650 --> 01:14:33,790
cause I'm going to do it. No, I'm
too tired. Yeah. You go, go to sleep.

1294
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:38,590
Seriously, you're putting on
a lot of weight and Oh my God,

1295
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:41,770
I'm not attracted to you right now.
I just don't understand what it is.

1296
01:14:42,790 --> 01:14:47,590
That's not true. Don't say that. Yeah.
He just told me I looked beautiful.

1297
01:14:47,591 --> 01:14:52,120
I do look beautiful. You still look great.
You're all fucking baby Mama. Belly.

1298
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:57,130
You're all belly. So
anyways, all right. I'm a,

1299
01:14:57,490 --> 01:14:57,851
I don't know.

1300
01:14:57,851 --> 01:15:01,420
I'm going to figure out how to make a
fucking pan into a griddle and make myself

1301
01:15:01,421 --> 01:15:04,810
something because I'm an adult and
I, I can't fucking have a griddle.

1302
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:07,330
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
No, I'm getting that grill.

1303
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,820
I'm getting rid of those
fucking tables out there.

1304
01:15:09,821 --> 01:15:13,300
There's too many fucking tables.
What do we have in the last sample?

1305
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:18,950
Is Jesus coming back right in our back
fucking yard? That long winded do.

1306
01:15:18,951 --> 01:15:23,230
She's going to sit there
and [inaudible] trashing.

1307
01:15:23,970 --> 01:15:28,450
Yes. You trashing Jesus. Easy.
Yeezys county. He goes by.

1308
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:32,950
Yes. Easy. Hey radio. Fuck you.

1309
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:40,060
Um, I want to get, I'm
going to get that big. Oh,

1310
01:15:40,061 --> 01:15:43,450

do you, what would you call that?

1311
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:46,290
What is radio form of communication. Yeah.

1312
01:15:47,070 --> 01:15:50,680
Yell at a form of communication and
that cancel a show at the fucking,

1313
01:15:50,681 --> 01:15:53,920
he has to be the Magic Johnson
House. Fuck you a internet,

1314
01:15:55,590 --> 01:15:58,930
but you internet can't on a string,

1315
01:15:59,670 --> 01:16:01,240
but you ham radio.

1316
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:06,390
We get it. Kevin Hart's funny. But So

1317
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:12,250
San Jose kid I saw and fucking
the new def jam. First of all,

1318
01:16:12,251 --> 01:16:16,720
Tony Rock flushing it as a host. Tony
Rock's a fucking star by the way.

1319
01:16:16,721 --> 01:16:19,650
I remember years ago when he had a
sketch show, Mexican guy fucking pop.

1320
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:24,610
He pops on TV. Robert, I forget
his last name. You tweet Tony,

1321
01:16:24,611 --> 01:16:27,680
not Tony Roberts. Tony
Roberts. I've known no,

1322
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:30,120
the name of the comic that you
liked. He tweeted about him.

1323
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:33,430
His name is Robert something. Oh
yeah, he was fucking hilarious.

1324
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:37,060
Fucking hilarious and didn't give a shit
if the crowd liked him, he had that,

1325
01:16:37,090 --> 01:16:40,990
the fucking Luther Vandross joke. Oh
my God. Yeah. I don't want to ruin it,

1326
01:16:40,991 --> 01:16:42,610
but yeah, just definitely check that out.

1327
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:45,950

is, that show is back in a, in a, uh,

1328
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:49,390

Tony rocket in that Gig. You know,

1329
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:52,720
definitely deserving ending on
a positive note. That's right.

1330
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,250
Go fuck yourselves.

1331
01:16:54,700 --> 01:16:58,420
I will talk to you on Thanksgiving and
that stomping you hear in the background.

1332
01:16:58,540 --> 01:17:03,520
We'll be near unapproved family.
Supposed to be making stuffing.

1333
01:17:03,810 --> 01:17:07,030
All right. Go fuck yourselves. Have a
great week. Great. Short week. Alright,

1334
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:09,950
and off to Wednesday night, the
greatest fucking night ever.

1335
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:12,800
If you're a young man, right?
You go back to your hometown.

1336
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:16,600
What's his face to thrill ride the throw
ride did a great rant on that. Who?

1337
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:21,590
The thrill ride? The one. The one man
fucking, Oh yeah, that guy weed. That guy.

1338
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:25,580
That guy should be in the WWE. He's one
of the best people on the fucking mic.

1339
01:17:25,610 --> 01:17:28,340
I forgot about him. Yeah,
he fucking said that.

1340
01:17:28,341 --> 01:17:30,080
That's the night you go
back and all the women,

1341
01:17:30,081 --> 01:17:33,830
you know you went to high school
with that you were afraid to talk to.

1342
01:17:33,831 --> 01:17:36,380
Now you come back, you got
your little man mustache.

1343
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:40,370
You make something happen the night
before Thanksgiving can happen.

1344
01:17:40,460 --> 01:17:41,540
That's right. Okay.

1345
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:45,290
I love Thanksgiving. You I
love, but Thanksgiving is,

1346
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:49,800
if we just rub it in the fucking
English England's face, you know,

1347
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:53,820
take debt. Right. But no,

1348
01:17:53,890 --> 01:17:56,670
there's a lot of people in this country
that think it has to do something with

1349
01:17:56,671 --> 01:17:59,880
our independence with England. Yeah.
What am I, nothing to do with that. Well,

1350
01:17:59,881 --> 01:18:04,440
that's one of my favorite things to do
is I say that to fucking a London ears

1351
01:18:04,441 --> 01:18:09,060
and shit. Oh, fucking one. I
forgot to bring up. There's a,

1352
01:18:09,061 --> 01:18:13,140
I got to do another benefit.
Uh, speaking of that, um,

1353
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:17,700
a buddy of mine who did stand up when I
started out and then moved on to writing

1354
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:21,930
, uh, Pete come and, uh, such
a great guy unfortunately, uh,

1355
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:25,830
passed away a Oh God,
a couple of weeks ago.

1356
01:18:25,890 --> 01:18:27,210
It was an absolute shock.

1357
01:18:27,211 --> 01:18:32,211
He's like a fucking year older than me
was in great health and just a had a

1358
01:18:32,521 --> 01:18:33,810
heart attack unfortunately.

1359
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:38,550
So we're going to be doing a benefit at
the laugh factory on December 6th. Um,

1360
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:42,870
tickets will be going on sales soon. I
should probably know by a thanksgiving.

1361
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:48,000
But um, he's got two beautiful
twin boys to only 10 years old.

1362
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:52,080
And um, the great things
going to be honest, so great.

1363
01:18:52,081 --> 01:18:56,100
Was Jamie Masada put his name
up on the, uh, the marquee.

1364
01:18:56,220 --> 01:18:57,690
I'll never forget that he did that.

1365
01:18:57,691 --> 01:19:00,450
That was such a great thing that he did
that cause Pete hasn't done stand up in

1366
01:19:00,451 --> 01:19:04,710
a number of years. It was great that
Jamie remembered him. He's a great guy.

1367
01:19:04,830 --> 01:19:08,340
Jamie Masada. He remembered him.
He put his name up there. And uh,

1368
01:19:08,341 --> 01:19:10,950
so there's a bunch of
Boston guys I haven't seen.

1369
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:14,370
We're all going to be on
the same fucking show. Um,

1370
01:19:14,430 --> 01:19:16,870
and I'm trying to think like the last
time we all worked together like that,

1371
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:19,980
it was probably the fucking
cow loon about 20 years ago.

1372
01:19:19,981 --> 01:19:22,890
So it's going to be a good reunion.
We're on, we telling great stories about,

1373
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:27,240
uh, p coming. So, um, yeah,
it's going to be December six,

1374
01:19:27,241 --> 01:19:29,930
and I'll get you guys that link as
soon as I get it. If you're in town,

1375
01:19:29,950 --> 01:19:33,540
you'd like to have a laugh, a to
great cause. All right. That's it.

1376
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:36,240
They Fuckos have a nice thanksgiving.
