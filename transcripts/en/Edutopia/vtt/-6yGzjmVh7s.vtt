00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:13.346
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So, welcome to the Saugus
Ironworks National Historic site.

00:00:14.116 --> 00:00:15.956
&gt;&gt;Narrator: It's a big
day for the fifth grade

00:00:15.956 --> 00:00:18.666
at Ferryway School
just outside Boston.

00:00:19.136 --> 00:00:20.736
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What's this
simple machine right here?

00:00:20.846 --> 00:00:22.666
Wheel and axle, right.

00:00:23.376 --> 00:00:26.176
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This field trip is the
highlight of a six-week project

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.736
that integrates science...

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:30.636
&gt;&gt;Teacher: This works like a lever
that presses the bellows closed,

00:00:31.236 --> 00:00:34.026
blows the air into the furnace.

00:00:34.026 --> 00:00:35.466
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...math, art, English...

00:00:35.906 --> 00:00:38.926
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So this is America's
first rolling and slitting mills.

00:00:38.926 --> 00:00:39.876
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...and history.

00:00:40.516 --> 00:00:41.006
&gt;&gt;Teacher: There we go.

00:00:41.006 --> 00:00:42.766
My metal's hot enough.

00:00:43.506 --> 00:00:44.616
This is called a hearty.

00:00:44.616 --> 00:00:45.936
What kind of simple machine is this?

00:00:46.526 --> 00:00:46.686
&gt;&gt;Class: Wedge.

00:00:46.686 --> 00:00:47.036
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Wedge.

00:00:47.906 --> 00:00:50.126
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students use
the latest technology tools

00:00:50.126 --> 00:00:52.176
to study the country's
earliest innovations.

00:00:52.176 --> 00:00:53.046
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And how's that?

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:53.706
A good-looking nail?

00:00:53.956 --> 00:00:54.066
&gt;&gt;Class: Yeah.

00:00:54.196 --> 00:00:56.426
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You guys
are too easy to please.

00:00:56.476 --> 00:00:58.576
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To earn the right
to go on the field trip,

00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:01.646
students spend weeks
accomplishing various tasks

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:03.136
to get their passport stamped.

00:01:03.806 --> 00:01:06.866
&gt;&gt;Margie: All of those stamps
are based on our state standards,

00:01:07.276 --> 00:01:10.596
from writing assignments
to design assignments.

00:01:11.016 --> 00:01:14.746
And, as they finish the
assignment, the passport is stamped.

00:01:14.926 --> 00:01:17.986
&gt;&gt;Narrator: All of the assignments
involve hands-on activities,

00:01:18.216 --> 00:01:20.636
from creating an outfit
for a rock person...

00:01:20.636 --> 00:01:24.776
&gt;&gt;Student: And it looks
like shiny metal.

00:01:24.956 --> 00:01:26.716
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...to studying
rocks and minerals,

00:01:27.046 --> 00:01:29.146
which also involves
Internet research.

00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:34.246
&gt;&gt;Student: Chemical composition
with an organized structure

00:01:34.246 --> 00:01:36.726
of a natural inorganic origin.

00:01:36.726 --> 00:01:41.736
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Technology specialist
Bob Simpson helped the team integrate

00:01:41.736 --> 00:01:43.416
technology on the project.

00:01:43.786 --> 00:01:46.076
&gt;&gt;Bob: Well, the teachers have
done all the really good research

00:01:46.076 --> 00:01:49.646
and constructed the structure of how
the students are going to navigate

00:01:49.736 --> 00:01:52.376
through that unit,
and ultimately what

00:01:52.376 --> 00:01:56.716
that does is it empowers the
students to make decisions.

00:01:56.776 --> 00:02:00.346
So, when they're researching rocks
and minerals, they get to pick

00:02:00.346 --> 00:02:03.986
which Web site they want to go to
to select their rock or mineral.

00:02:04.186 --> 00:02:06.956
&gt;&gt;So, go ahead and click
on your Internet browser.

00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:09.516
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students
also access the Web

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:11.536
to study the history
of the ironworks.

00:02:12.206 --> 00:02:15.416
The Saugus unit site also
features a parent page

00:02:15.476 --> 00:02:17.676
that is translated
into several languages.

00:02:17.676 --> 00:02:19.146
&gt;&gt;Student: It's over here in the X.

00:02:19.446 --> 00:02:23.316
&gt;&gt;Tom: We've had about 75 different
languages spoken in this community,

00:02:23.846 --> 00:02:26.076
so you can imagine what that
brings to the table every day,

00:02:26.506 --> 00:02:31.966
but this kind of cooperative work
environment, teachers and students,

00:02:32.726 --> 00:02:36.536
supersedes that, and working with
the computer, working with a partner,

00:02:36.576 --> 00:02:40.416
going on the field trip, those
things are the intangibles

00:02:40.416 --> 00:02:43.716
that bring this whole project
to life and can reach kids

00:02:44.126 --> 00:02:46.936
that you may never be able
to reach in other ways.

00:02:47.186 --> 00:02:49.786
&gt;&gt;Student: This is a picture
and right here is a caption.

00:02:49.786 --> 00:02:53.136
&gt;&gt;Bob: Your mission is to
write a description caption

00:02:53.136 --> 00:02:54.806
for the pictures you took today.

00:02:54.806 --> 00:02:57.346
&gt;&gt;Narrator: With digital cameras
the school received as part

00:02:57.346 --> 00:03:00.956
of a technology grant, students
add their field-trip photos

00:03:00.956 --> 00:03:02.316
to an ironworks wiki.

00:03:02.416 --> 00:03:04.596
&gt;&gt;Bob: Let's get these
pictures into your laptops,

00:03:05.196 --> 00:03:07.316
so connect your cable to your camera.

00:03:07.316 --> 00:03:09.156
&gt;&gt;Margie: I've seen lots
of intrinsic learning.

00:03:09.366 --> 00:03:11.686
I think the kids own
what they've learned.

00:03:12.146 --> 00:03:14.116
They're very proud of their work.

00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:18.316
They can talk about their
work, and they share much more.

00:03:18.386 --> 00:03:21.036
&gt;&gt;Student: Do you like
the other one too?

00:03:21.036 --> 00:03:21.276
&gt;&gt;Student: Yeah.

00:03:21.386 --> 00:03:24.366
&gt;&gt;Margie: They're learning
through the technology definitely

00:03:24.366 --> 00:03:28.246
and with the technology, and they're
able to sort of publish themselves

00:03:28.246 --> 00:03:30.756
at a level that we haven't
been able to do before.

00:03:30.906 --> 00:03:31.376
&gt;&gt;Student: Wait.

00:03:31.376 --> 00:03:31.626
What's that?

00:03:31.626 --> 00:03:32.816
&gt;&gt;Student: I don't know.

00:03:32.816 --> 00:03:33.816
I think you took that.

00:03:34.236 --> 00:03:36.296
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The integration
of various subjects

00:03:36.296 --> 00:03:38.706
in one project also seems to work.

00:03:38.706 --> 00:03:41.226
&gt;&gt;Anxhela: If you're in different
classes, you sometimes forget,

00:03:41.316 --> 00:03:46.746
because your mind's on one class,
and then you have to be focused

00:03:46.746 --> 00:03:50.306
on another class, but when it's
all together you can just focus

00:03:50.306 --> 00:03:52.346
on one thing, because
it's all the same.

00:03:52.406 --> 00:03:55.836
&gt;&gt;Margie: The circumference of the
circle, so when you measure around...

00:03:55.906 --> 00:03:59.316
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The most exciting
hands-on activity is a competition

00:03:59.316 --> 00:04:02.076
to build the most efficient
Styrofoam water wheel.

00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:03.306
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Sixteenth of an inch.

00:04:03.506 --> 00:04:06.926
I mean, we're talking
maybe two millimeters.

00:04:07.766 --> 00:04:10.706
&gt;&gt;Narrator: As part of a team of more
than a dozen teachers and mentors

00:04:10.706 --> 00:04:14.446
on the project, Earl Fitzpatrick
runs the school's tech lab.

00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:17.206
&gt;&gt;Earl: The technology
education lab is a place

00:04:17.206 --> 00:04:19.686
where the students can
come into the room,

00:04:20.236 --> 00:04:22.996
actually physically
construct a project.

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:24.866
It gives them ownership.

00:04:25.406 --> 00:04:26.126
They built it.

00:04:26.636 --> 00:04:30.856
They'll test it, and in this
case we'll have not only learned

00:04:30.856 --> 00:04:32.906
about the water wheel, but they
learned about all the tools

00:04:32.906 --> 00:04:35.716
and machines that it takes to
produce a working prototype,

00:04:36.086 --> 00:04:40.256
the steps in the design process
and, whether it succeeds or fails,

00:04:40.366 --> 00:04:42.976
they can come back and rebuild
it to make it a success.

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:46.126
&gt;&gt;Class: [chants]

00:04:46.626 --> 00:04:48.746
&gt;&gt;Earl: And they can actually
test it to see if it works

00:04:48.746 --> 00:04:50.436
and compare their work
against other students.

00:04:50.656 --> 00:04:51.586
It's almost self-grading.

00:04:51.586 --> 00:04:55.256
&gt;&gt;Two hundred and fifty grams
plus one thousand grams.

00:04:55.886 --> 00:04:57.196
&gt;&gt;There's no need to
grade the project.

00:04:57.196 --> 00:05:00.766
I mean, you put it on the test
stand and see how much it lifts,

00:05:00.836 --> 00:05:04.946
and the kids can know,
"Hey, I made a good effort

00:05:04.986 --> 00:05:06.376
and my water wheel is efficient.

00:05:06.376 --> 00:05:07.086
I've achieved the goal."

00:05:07.936 --> 00:05:11.076
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Whether they finish first
or last, the teams are encouraged

00:05:11.076 --> 00:05:12.976
to learn from their efforts.

00:05:13.096 --> 00:05:14.586
&gt;&gt;Andy: Looking at where
the water's spilling out

00:05:14.996 --> 00:05:18.706
and how the wheel is operating right
now, what might you change about it?

00:05:19.096 --> 00:05:19.466
&gt;&gt;Student: Bigger cups.

00:05:19.816 --> 00:05:20.476
&gt;&gt;Andy: Some bigger cups.

00:05:20.476 --> 00:05:21.396
So why would you add bigger cups?

00:05:22.066 --> 00:05:23.486
&gt;&gt;Student: So there
could be more water.

00:05:23.926 --> 00:05:26.156
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Graduate
engineering student Andy Mueller

00:05:26.396 --> 00:05:29.956
from nearby Tufts University guides
them through the redesign process.

00:05:30.076 --> 00:05:32.096
&gt;&gt;Andy: This is exactly
what engineers do.

00:05:32.096 --> 00:05:34.906
You don't know how something is
going to operate until you build it

00:05:34.906 --> 00:05:35.886
and test it until failure.

00:05:35.886 --> 00:05:38.436
Now we know that there's a lot of
water spilling out the side of this.

00:05:38.466 --> 00:05:38.976
You might want to add...

00:05:39.326 --> 00:05:41.146
&gt;&gt;You don't really know
what you want to do.

00:05:41.586 --> 00:05:45.396
If you can see someone that's excited
about anything, it helps the kids

00:05:45.396 --> 00:05:47.626
out to maybe say, "Well, if he is
that excited about engineering,"

00:05:47.746 --> 00:05:48.896
then get the kids excited about it,

00:05:48.896 --> 00:05:50.646
and maybe they'll want
to go into engineering.

00:05:50.706 --> 00:05:52.916
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Their water
wheels seem far more advanced

00:05:52.976 --> 00:05:53.936
than the first year.

00:05:54.536 --> 00:05:55.976
Where did that come from?

00:05:56.006 --> 00:05:56.256
How did that...

00:05:56.256 --> 00:05:59.816
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Redesign is also part
of the process for the teaching team

00:05:59.816 --> 00:06:03.306
that created the ironworks
project in 2002.

00:06:03.436 --> 00:06:05.086
&gt;&gt;Earl: We had time in the shop.

00:06:05.386 --> 00:06:09.576
Then the two fifth-grade science
teachers were very flexible, I mean,

00:06:09.746 --> 00:06:11.386
to the point where we
were on the phone up-

00:06:11.386 --> 00:06:14.326
and downstairs shuttling students up
and down so that they could re-glue.

00:06:14.326 --> 00:06:15.646
They had time to decorate.

00:06:15.646 --> 00:06:18.716
They had time to make
last-minute adjustments,

00:06:18.746 --> 00:06:20.596
things that we didn't have before.

00:06:20.686 --> 00:06:21.836
It adds a component.

00:06:21.836 --> 00:06:24.636
That technology component
makes a big difference.

00:06:25.106 --> 00:06:27.506
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Buoyed by the
success of the ironworks project,

00:06:27.506 --> 00:06:29.696
the team tackled another project.

00:06:30.096 --> 00:06:32.926
&gt;&gt;Paul: So, today we're going
to look at pictures of animals

00:06:33.346 --> 00:06:37.306
and we're going to make predictions
about the biomes that they live

00:06:37.306 --> 00:06:40.186
in based on all the work
that you've done to date.

00:06:40.186 --> 00:06:43.896
&gt;&gt;Narrator: As part of a
second-year HP technology grant,

00:06:44.156 --> 00:06:46.596
the fifth-grade team
mentored fourth-grade teachers

00:06:46.596 --> 00:06:48.446
in developing the biome unit.

00:06:48.676 --> 00:06:50.336
&gt;&gt;Paul: And then you
ask the question,

00:06:50.416 --> 00:06:51.556
so it's three different ways.

00:06:51.866 --> 00:06:54.746
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You're going to
bring me at least up to here?

00:06:54.866 --> 00:06:54.986
&gt;&gt;Paul: Yeah.

00:06:54.986 --> 00:06:57.126
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The project
started with a Web quest,

00:06:57.476 --> 00:07:00.616
which led to students designing
PowerPoint presentations

00:07:00.616 --> 00:07:01.526
of a particular biome.

00:07:01.716 --> 00:07:02.566
&gt;&gt;Paul: All right.

00:07:03.636 --> 00:07:04.276
Take a look.

00:07:05.486 --> 00:07:07.206
Slide looks really good.

00:07:08.146 --> 00:07:09.756
Climagraph looks good.

00:07:10.246 --> 00:07:10.956
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Information

00:07:11.216 --> 00:07:14.366
for the PowerPoint presentations
came from Internet research.

00:07:14.826 --> 00:07:17.596
&gt;&gt;Sara: Who can tell
me what a herbivore is?

00:07:18.076 --> 00:07:20.736
&gt;&gt;It's just been a totally
wonderful experience.

00:07:20.736 --> 00:07:23.916
They actually are looking
forward to something for a change.

00:07:24.516 --> 00:07:28.116
I think it's just hands-on
and they don't have to listen

00:07:28.116 --> 00:07:29.666
to my voice droning on and on

00:07:29.666 --> 00:07:31.346
and they're discovering
things on their own.

00:07:32.086 --> 00:07:34.106
It's just amazing, some of
the questions that have come

00:07:34.106 --> 00:07:36.966
up from their own discoveries instead

00:07:36.966 --> 00:07:38.966
of me feeding all the
information to them.

00:07:38.966 --> 00:07:40.496
I think that's the biggest piece.

00:07:41.266 --> 00:07:45.116
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It's related to the
wolverines, minx and weasels.

00:07:45.276 --> 00:07:48.006
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At the end of the
unit, they were challenged

00:07:48.006 --> 00:07:51.406
to justify why a certain animal
might live in a given biome.

00:07:52.556 --> 00:07:56.906
&gt;&gt;Paul: So, using your remotes,
make sure that you select a biome.

00:07:58.066 --> 00:08:00.796
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And their answers
were tabulated instantly

00:08:00.796 --> 00:08:02.836
with a student-response system.

00:08:03.426 --> 00:08:06.396
&gt;&gt;Student: I chose the
temperature of the deciduous forest,

00:08:07.226 --> 00:08:10.546
because there's lots
of rodents there.

00:08:10.726 --> 00:08:14.286
&gt;&gt;Paul: We wanted to keep
that idea of inquiry-based,

00:08:14.466 --> 00:08:19.096
so it enabled the students to kind
of start that type of learning,

00:08:19.096 --> 00:08:20.996
which is a stretch for a lot of kids,

00:08:20.996 --> 00:08:23.116
because they are used
to: Open the book.

00:08:23.116 --> 00:08:23.926
Read the chapter.

00:08:23.926 --> 00:08:24.956
Answer the questions.

00:08:25.406 --> 00:08:26.396
This is different.

00:08:26.396 --> 00:08:28.646
It's not necessarily a
matter of right or wrong.

00:08:29.106 --> 00:08:31.946
If you can justify it, if
you can support your answer,

00:08:32.056 --> 00:08:36.366
then it's a valuable answer, and the
students respond to that quite well

00:08:36.506 --> 00:08:38.976
and they remember what it
is that they're learning.

00:08:39.426 --> 00:08:40.926
&gt;&gt;Who chose the rainforest?

00:08:40.926 --> 00:08:45.456
&gt;&gt;Student: I chose the rainforest
because there are a lot of insects,

00:08:45.456 --> 00:08:50.216
and it eats insects, so it's
one of its food sources.

00:08:50.926 --> 00:08:54.326
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The biome and ironworks
projects inspired both teachers

00:08:54.326 --> 00:08:56.926
and students, and their
test scores rose well

00:08:56.926 --> 00:08:59.056
above other fifth-graders
in the district.

00:08:59.056 --> 00:08:59.996
&gt;&gt;Student: I took that picture.

00:09:00.336 --> 00:09:02.726
&gt;&gt;Earl: There's a lot of life
lessons to be learned by physical,

00:09:02.726 --> 00:09:05.366
hands-on projects, whether
it be a science experiment,

00:09:05.366 --> 00:09:07.246
a tech-ed experiment.

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:08.316
They learn leadership roles.

00:09:08.386 --> 00:09:10.276
They learn how to get
along, how to cooperate,

00:09:10.386 --> 00:09:12.826
and it's good for everyone.

00:09:12.826 --> 00:09:13.516
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Here we go.

00:09:14.016 --> 00:09:15.886
&gt;&gt;Class: [chants]

00:09:15.886 --> 00:09:18.266
&gt;&gt;Earl: Often you don't
have the chance to show kids

00:09:18.486 --> 00:09:22.746
that education is real, that there
is value to it, that it's out there,

00:09:22.746 --> 00:09:24.336
and they get a chance to
put that all together.

00:09:24.816 --> 00:09:27.826
Once in a while, the magic happens,
and it has happened the last couple

00:09:27.826 --> 00:09:29.646
of days and it's happened the
last five years we've been doing

00:09:29.646 --> 00:09:29.976
this project.

00:09:30.516 --> 00:09:32.546
&gt;&gt;Class: [cheers]

00:09:33.046 --> 00:09:38.276
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You're on the lift.

00:09:39.046 --> 00:09:40.916
