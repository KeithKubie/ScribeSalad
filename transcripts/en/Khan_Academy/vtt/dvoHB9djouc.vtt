00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.760
Let's say I'm trying to judge
how many years of experience

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.100
we have at the Khan Academy.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.050
Or on average, how many
years of experience we have.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.100
And in particular, the
particular type of average

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.490
we'll focus on, is
the arithmetic mean.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.771
So I go and I survey
the folks there.

00:00:15.771 --> 00:00:18.020
And let's say this was when
Khan Academy was a smaller

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.436
organization, when
there were only

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.130
five people in the organization.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.240
And I find-- and I'm surveying
the entire population--

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.237
so years of experience, the
entire population of Khan

00:00:27.237 --> 00:00:29.320
Academy, because that's
what I care about,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.930
years of experience at our
organization, at Khan Academy.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.940
And this was when
we had five people.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.870
And I were to go--
we're now 36 people,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.620
I don't want to date this video
too much-- but let's say I go,

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.036
and I say, OK, there's one
person straight out of college,

00:00:42.036 --> 00:00:43.420
they have one year
of experience,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.920
or recently out of
college, somebody

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.940
with three years of
experience, someone

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.810
with five years of
experience, someone

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.630
with seven years of experience,
and someone very experienced,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.100
or reasonably experienced,
with 14 years of experience.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.150
So based on this data point,
and this is our population,

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.150
for years of experience.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.900
I'm assuming that we
only have five people

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.340
in the organization,
at this point.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:07.930
What would be the
population mean

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.710
for the years of experience?

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.400
What is the mean years of
experience for my population?

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.250
Well, we can just
calculate that.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.190
Our mean experience,
and I'm going

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.166
to denote it with
mu, because we're

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:21.540
talking about the
population now.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.590
This is a parameter
for the population.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.310
It's going to be equal to the
sum, from our first data point,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.200
so data point one all the way
to data point, in this case,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.520
data point five-- we have
five data points-- of each

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.867
of-- so we're going to take
all, from the first data

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:43.700
point, the second data
point, the third data

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.033
point, all the way to the fifth.

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:47.435
So this is going to be
equal to x1, plus x--

00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:49.893
and I'm going to divide it all
by the number of data points

00:01:49.893 --> 00:01:58.010
I have-- plus x2, plus x3, plus
x4, plus x sub 5, subscript 5.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.750
All of that over 5.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.950
And as we said, this is a
very fancy way of saying,

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.400
I'm going to sum up
all of these things

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.009
and then divide by the
number of things we have.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.039
So let's do that.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.540
Get the calculator out.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.595
So I'm going to add them
all up, 1 plus 3 plus 5--

00:02:18.595 --> 00:02:23.590
I really don't need a calculator
for this-- plus 7 plus 14.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.840
So that's five data points.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.150
And I'm going to divide by 5.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.930
And I get 6.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.470
So the population
mean, for years

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.540
of experience at my
organization, is 6.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.280
6 years of experience.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.640
Well, that's, I
guess, interesting.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.730
But now I want to
ask another question.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.470
I want to get some
measure of how much spread

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:45.900
there is around that mean.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.671
Or how much do the data
points vary around that mean.

00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:50.920
And obviously, I can give
someone all the data points.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.990
But instead, I actually
want to come up

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.030
with a parameter that
somehow represents

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.490
how much all of these things,
on average, are varying

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.880
from this number right here.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.150
Or maybe I will call
that thing the variance.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.410
And so, what I do-- so the
variance-- and I will do--

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.280
and this is a
population variance

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.510
that I'm talking about, just
to be clear, it's a parameter.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.990
The population
variance I'm going

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.040
to denote with the Greek letter
sigma, lowercase sigma-- this

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.530
is capital sigma--
lowercase sigma squared.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.600
And I'm going to
say, well, I'm going

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.310
to take the distance from each
of these points to the mean.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.064
And just so I get a positive
value, I'm going to square it.

00:03:35.064 --> 00:03:37.480
And then, I'm going to divide
by the number of data points

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.046
that I have.

00:03:38.046 --> 00:03:39.420
So essentially,
I'm going to find

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.370
the average squared distance.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.120
Now that might sound
very complicated,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.600
but let's actually work it out.

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.930
So I'll take my first
data point and I

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.624
will subtract our mean from it.

00:03:51.624 --> 00:03:53.540
So this is going to give
me a negative number.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.630
But if I square it, it's
going to be positive.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.005
So it's, essentially,
going to be

00:03:57.005 --> 00:03:59.930
the squared distance
between 1 and my mean.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.450
And then, to that,
I'm going to add

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.840
the squared distance
between 3 and my mean.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.310
And to that, I'm going to add
the squared distance between 5

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.974
and my mean.

00:04:13.974 --> 00:04:15.390
And since I'm
squaring, it doesn't

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.603
matter if I do 5
minus 6, or 6 minus 5.

00:04:17.603 --> 00:04:19.769
When I square it, I'm going
to get a positive result

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:20.990
regardless.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.780
And then, to that
I'm going to add

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.590
the squared distance
between 7 and my mean.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.020
So 7 minus 6 squared.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.540
All of this, this
is my population

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.750
mean that I'm finding
the difference between.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.880
And then, finally, the squared
difference between 14 and my

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.380
mean.

00:04:42.042 --> 00:04:43.750
And then, I'm going
to find, essentially,

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.600
the mean of these
squared distances.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.800
So I have five squared
distances right over here.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:56.450
So let me divide by 5.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.860
So what will I get when
I make this calculation,

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.070
right over here?

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.710
Well, let's figure this out.

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:09.650
This is going to be equal
to 1 minus 6 is negative 5,

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:13.200
negative 5 squared is 25.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.630
3 minus 6 is negative 3, now
if I square that, I get 9.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.820
5 minus 6 is negative 1, if I
square it, I get positive 1.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.440
7 minus 6 is 1, if I square
it, I get positive 1.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.240
And 14 minus 6 is 8, if
I square it, I get 64.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.335
And then, I'm going to
divide all of that by 5.

00:05:36.335 --> 00:05:38.080
And I don't need to
use a calculator,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.000
but I tend to make a
lot of careless mistakes

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.140
when I do things
while making a video.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:53.860
So I get 25 plus 9 plus 1
plus 1 plus 64 divided by 5.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.630
So I get 20.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.570
So the average squared distance,
or the mean squared distance,

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:05.452
from our population
mean is equal to 20.

00:06:05.452 --> 00:06:07.410
You may say, wait, these
things aren't 20 away.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.730
Remember, it's the
squared distance

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.370
away from my population mean.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.954
So I squared each
of these things.

00:06:13.954 --> 00:06:15.620
I liked it, because
it made it positive.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.110
And we'll see later it has
other nice properties about it.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.760
Now the last thing
is, how can we

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.680
represent this mathematically?

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.640
We already saw that we know how
to represent a population mean,

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:28.730
and a sample mean,
mathematically like this,

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.480
and hopefully, we don't find
it that daunting anymore.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.080
But how would we do
the exact same thing?

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:38.340
How would we denote what
we did, right over here?

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.910
Well, let's just
think it through.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:44.440
We're just saying that
the population variance,

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.895
we're taking the sum
of each-- so we're

00:06:50.895 --> 00:06:53.270
going to take each item, we'll
start with the first item.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.270
And we're going to go to the
n-th item in our population.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.582
We're talking about
a population here.

00:06:59.582 --> 00:07:01.040
And we're going to
take-- we're not

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.040
going to just take the item,
this would just be the item--

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.290
but we're going take the item.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.172
And from that, we're going to
subtract the population mean.

00:07:09.172 --> 00:07:10.630
We're going to
subtract this thing.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.300
We're going to
subtract this thing.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:13.620
We're going to square it.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:14.890
We're going to square it.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.190
So the way I've
written it right now,

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.565
this would just
be the numerator.

00:07:17.565 --> 00:07:20.530
I've just taken the sum
of each of these things,

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.180
the sum of the difference
between each data

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.470
point and the population
mean and squared it.

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.350
If I really want to get
the way I figure out

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:28.891
this variance right
over here, I have

00:07:28.891 --> 00:07:33.815
to divide the whole thing by the
number of data points we have.

00:07:33.815 --> 00:07:35.190
So this might seem
very daunting,

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:36.106
and very intimidating.

00:07:36.106 --> 00:07:39.300
But all it says is, take each
of your data points-- well, one,

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.500
it says, figure out
your population mean.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.260
Figure that out first.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:51.230
And then, from each data
point, in your population,

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:54.590
subtract out that
population mean, square it,

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.510
take the sum of all
of those things,

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.820
and then just divide by the
number of data points you have.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:03.867
And you will get your
population variance.
