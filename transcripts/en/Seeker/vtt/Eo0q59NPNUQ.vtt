00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.180
Dead batteries are the worst. Once they're
all used up, I have to find a place to recycle

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:10.469
them and keep them around until… BLAHRGH.
Why aren't all batteries rechargeable?

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.680
We've spent a lot of time on DNews talking

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.279
about batteries, and usually it's about how
much they suck, but maybe we're not giving

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.570
them a fair shake. There's a lot of technology
going into these tiny powerhouses.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.960
The first true battery was invented by Alessandro
Volta in 1800, and he called it the voltaic

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.020
cell, a term we still use today. All batteries,
even Volta's original ones, have an anode,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.700
electrolyte and cathode. The anode (neg) provides
electrons to the electrolyte, through a chemical

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.239
reaction, then the cathode (pos) absorbs the
electrons from that electrolyte! If you're

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.079
like me, this is the opposite way you expected
power to flow, from negative to positive…

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.539
but, hey, science!

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:59.590
Batteries you see a lot: AA, AAA, C, D cells…
are all alkaline batteries: which means the

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.480
cathode is made of manganese dioxide, the
anode is a zinc power; the electrolyte is

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.180
a potassium hydroxide -- which is the alkali
part. Alkali solutions are basic. Not, like,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.070
basic the insult, but basic as opposed to
acidic. Battery acids have a high Ph, which

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.140
makes them an alkali. Ph is a way to describe
a solution in chemistry as either acidic or

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.030
alkali; P for Power and the H symbol for Hydrogen.
Alkali battery acids have high levels of Hydrogen

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.610
ions -- H-plus -- the ions suck the electrons
from the negative anode, and then the positively

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.240
charged cathode sucks them from the electrolyte.
Boom! You've got a battery! When these anodes

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.890
and cathodes are connected through -- say
-- a flashlight or cell phone, the electrons

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.720
streaming from the anode to the cathode are
what is powering the device. Eventually, in

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.360
a regular battery, the anode gets corroded,
the chemical reaction is spent, and the battery

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.160
is dead.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.110
SIDEBAR: Sometimes, hitting or shaking a near-dead
flashlight makes it brighten. This is due

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.460
to the nature of chemical reactions in batteries.
The electrolyte is corroding the anode, and

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.860
when you smack it the chemical reaction briefly
kicks it up a notch. You can't do this forever,

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.450
but it's not just in your head, it does help
a little!

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.630
Non-rechargeables are called primary cells,
and rechargeable batteries are called secondary

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.890
cells. Once a primary cell is dead, it's pretty
much dead. But when you plug a secondary cell

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:29.360
into the wall, the charger forces electrons
to stream the opposite direction, recharging

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.840
the battery! You could plug in a primary cell,
but when you try and force electrons back

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.860
through, the chemical reaction doesn't reverse
as efficiently. In alkaline batteries, this

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.980
can cause the electrolyte solution to generate
a hydrogen gas in a confined space until {explosion

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.400
noise}! So don't do that.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.650
Most secondary cells you're going to come
in contact with are Lithium Ion. Engineers

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.990
use lithium in a lot of batteries because
it's a highly reactive element. Lithium-Ion

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.819
secondary cells use Lithium cobalt oxide as
a positive cathode, and simple carbon as an

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.069
anode. With a combination of elements, electrons
can be pushed back and forth from the carbon

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.040
to the lithium and back again many times,
though not indefinitely. Batteries in your

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.680
phone, for example, can only be recharged
a couple hundred times and they'll slowly

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.000
hold fewer and fewer electrons.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.840
The reason secondary cells can take the heat
and recharge, while primary cells can't, has

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.900
to do with the elements chosen, and a bit
of 200-year-old chemistry. Primary AA batteries

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.340
use cheaper materials like manganese and are
great for low-draw devices like flashlights,

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.510
and smoke detectors. While lithium is more
expensive and great for high-draw devices

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.850
like computers and phones. Thats why you don't
see AA-sized Lithium-Ion batteries. Nickel-Cadmium

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.040
is an affordable middle-ground, with some
voltage and some capacity for cameras and

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.010
smaller devices where Lithium Ion isn't practical!
(If you're curious, nickel is the cathode,

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.690
and cadmium is the anode)

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.040
When it comes to computers and devices that
use Lithium Ion batteries, they probably have

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.790
another thing in common, Intel. Having Intel
inside makes for better experiences outside.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.880
Intel creates the breakthrough technologies
that make amazing experiences possible, driving

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:19.940
innovation in processors, wearables, data
centers and devices for the internet of things.
