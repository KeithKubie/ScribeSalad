00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:09.902 line:91%
OKAY, SO SHE STOOD HER GROUND,
THE JUDGE PUT HER IN JAIL, AND

00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:13.072 align:start position:0% line:91%
SHE SENT OUT HER LAWYER TO LET
US KNOW HER DEMANDS.

00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:16.042 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; NUMBER ONE, SHE HAS NO
INTENTION TO RESIGN.

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:18.678 line:91%

PEOPLE OF ROWAN COUNTY AS SHE

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.470 line:91%
GOOD LORD, SINCE WHEN DO FEDERAL
EMPLOYEES GET TO RENEGOTIATE THE

CONDITIONS OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT?

00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:47.473 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT?

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:50.143 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN, LIKE HER JOB HAS TO
MATCH HER VIEW OF THE WORLD IN

00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:00.352 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT?

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:03.156 line:91%
BUT SHE'S GOT A LOT OF SUPPORT
AND PEOPLE ARE CALLING HER BRAVE

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.057 line:85%
BECAUSE SHE'S SPEAKING HER MIND.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:13.065 align:start position:0% line:91%
( LAUGHTER )
SHE'S SPEAKING HER MIND.

00:02:13.098 --> 00:02:16.903 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT IF SPEAKING HER MIND
HURTS OTHER PEOPLE, THAT'S NOT

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:17.370 align:start position:0% line:85%
BRAVE.

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:18.438 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S ( BLEEP ).

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:23.176 align:start position:0% line:91%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
HERE'S WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.747 size:88% position:44% line:91%
WHY IS SPEAKING YOUR MIND A
QUALITY ADMIRED AND REWARDED

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.749 size:84% position:42% line:85%
ABOVE ALL OTHERS RIGHT NOW?

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:31.384 size:81% position:41% line:85%
DOESN'T IT SEEM LIKE THAT?

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:35.988 line:91%
I MEAN IT, DOESN'T MATTER THAT
DONALD TRUMP CALLED MEXICANS

00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:36.588 align:start position:0% line:85%
RAPISTS.

00:02:36.622 --> 00:02:37.190 size:78% position:39% line:85%
HE WAS SPEAKING HIS MIND.

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:38.457 align:start position:0% line:85%
I'M VOTING FOR HIM.

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.591 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE'S SPEAKING HIS MIND.

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:45.097 align:start position:0% line:91%
I CAN'T LET THOSE GAYS GET
MARRIED BECAUSE OF MY BELIEFS.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.167 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR
BELIEFS.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.904 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE WHOLE POINT OF HAVING A
GOVERNMENT JOB IS NOT TO GIVE A

00:02:51.937 --> 00:02:52.404 align:start position:0% line:85%
DAMN.

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:53.506 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT'S WHOLE POINT.

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:56.275 align:start position:0% line:91%
<i> ( APPLAUSE )</i>
ANYWAY, TODAY SHE WAS LET OUT OF

00:02:56.308 --> 00:02:56.809 align:start position:0% line:85%
JAIL.

00:02:56.842 --> 00:02:58.010 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOW, HERE'S THE THING.

00:02:58.043 --> 00:03:00.313 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU WOULD THINK AFTER A SHAMEFUL
INCIDENT LIKE THIS SHE WOULD

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:03.916 align:start position:0% line:91%
KIND OF QUIETLY WALK OUT THE
BACK DOOR, GO HOME, AND

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:08.287 line:91%
CONTEMPLATE WHAT JESUS ACTUALLY
CARED ABOUT-- MULTIPLYING FISH,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.558 line:91%
RAISING PEOPLE FROM THE DEAD,
TURNING WATER INTO WINE, AND

00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:15.494 align:start position:0% line:91%
ALSO LOVING THY NEIGHBOR AS
THYSELF.

00:03:15.527 --> 00:03:18.331 line:85%
BUT REMEMBER, WE'RE IN KENTUCKY.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:20.566 align:start position:0% line:91%
( APPLAUSE )
WE ARE IN KENTUCKY, AND IT'S AN

ELECTION YEAR.

00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:27.139 size:81% position:41% line:91%
SO INSTEAD OF COMING OUT
QUIETLY, SHE FULFILLED THE

00:03:27.172 --> 00:03:29.175 align:start position:0% line:91%
SCRIPTURES BY EXITING JAIL
THUSLY.

00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:32.311 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THAT HER ACT IS
GOING TO WAKE UP THE

00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:34.614 align:start position:0% line:91%
POLITICIANS, THE PASTORS, AND
THE PEOPLE.

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:41.287 align:start position:0% line:91%
WOULD YOU PLEASE HELP ME WELCOME

YOU'VE GOT TO ( BLEEP ) BE
KIDDING ME.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.208 line:91%
THAT'S RIGHT, THIS COUNTY CLERK
CAME OUT OF JAIL TO A CROWD FULL

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:06.512 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF SUPPORTERS WAVING CROSSES TO
THE THEME FROM "ROCKY."

00:04:06.545 --> 00:04:10.016 align:start position:0% line:91%

( LAUGHTER )
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU GUYS, BUT

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:19.225 line:91%
WHEN I SEE A GROUP OF PEOPLE IN
THE SOUTH WITH WHITE CROSSES,

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:22.061 line:91%
CHEERING TO NOT ALLOW PEOPLE
THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, IT

00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:30.936 align:start position:0% line:91%
KIND OF JUST GIVES ME A TINGLY,
LYNCH-Y FEELING.

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:40.479 align:start position:0% line:91%

THE GUY COVERED HIS FACE "OH,

00:04:41.013 --> 00:04:44.116 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE SAID 'LYNCH-Y'."

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:45.751 size:78% position:39% line:85%
WHAT DID SHE HAVE TO SAY?

00:04:45.784 --> 00:04:49.755 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I JUST WANT TO GIVE GOD THE

00:05:03.268 --> 00:05:06.105 size:84% position:42% line:91%

CONCERNED, IT IS ALWAYS THE

00:05:06.138 --> 00:05:08.207 align:start position:0% line:91%
SEASON TO MAKE A HORRIBLE
COMPARISON.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.678 line:91%

00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:16.882 line:91%
CONFLICT WITH GOD'S MORAL LAW,
WE HAVE TO OBEY GOD'S MORAL LAW.

00:05:16.915 --> 00:05:20.720 line:91%
