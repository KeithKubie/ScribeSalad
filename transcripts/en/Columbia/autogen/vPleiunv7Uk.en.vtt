heuristic for the center now we have
 

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.780
heuristic for the center now we have
about six or seven different triangle

work we're developing media that's an
 

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.560
work we're developing media that's an
expression of that research and also in

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:01.570
expression of that research and also in
 

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.050
expression of that research and also in
advance of that research that works both

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:04.060

underserved populations that we're

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:11.200
underserved populations that we're
 

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.980
underserved populations that we're
talking about so I would say crossover

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:13.990
talking about so I would say crossover
 

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.050
