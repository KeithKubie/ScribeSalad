00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.550
In this video, I want to
cover several topics

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:03.650
that are all related.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.850
And on some level, they're
really simple, but on a whole

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.883
other level, they tend to
confuse people a lot.

00:00:07.883 --> 00:00:10.110
So hopefully we can
make some headway.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.400
So a good place to start-- let's
just imagine that I have

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.460
some type of container here.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.130
Let's say that's my container
and inside of that container,

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.430
I have a bunch of
water molecules.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.070
It's just got a bunch
of water molecules.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.550
They're all rubbing against
each other.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.920
It's in its liquid form,
this is liquid water.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.340
and inside of the water
molecules, I

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.050
have some sugar molecules.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.790
Maybe I'll do sugar in
this pink color.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.690
So I have a bunch of sugar
molecules right here.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.040
I have many, many more water
molecules though.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.290
I want to make that clear.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.660
Now in this type of situation,
we call the thing that there's

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.440
more of, the solvent.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.350
So in this case, there's more
water molecules and you can

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.990
literally just view more as
the number of molecules.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.010
I'm not going to go into a whole
discussion of moles and

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.140
all of that because you may or
may not have been exposed to

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.670
that yet, but just imagine
whatever there's more of,

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.740
that's what we're going
to call the solvent.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.630
So in this case, water
is the solvent.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.030
And whatever there is less of--
in this case, that is the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.730
sugar-- that is considered
the solute.

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:37.640
It doesn't have to be sugar.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.320
It can be any molecule that
there's less of, in the water,

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.570
in this case.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.620
And we say that the sugar has
been dissolved into the water.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.420
And this whole thing right here,
the combination of the

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.229
water and the sugar molecules,
we call a solution.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.140
We call this whole
thing a solution.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.870
And a solution has the solvent
and the solute.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.160
The solvent is water.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.110
That's the thing doing the
dissolving and the thing that

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.220
is dissolved is the sugar.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.290
That's the solute.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.950
Now all of this may or may not
be review for you, but I'm

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.870
doing it for a reason-- because
I want to talk about

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.370
the idea of a diffusion.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.490
And the idea is actually
pretty straightforward.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.790
If I have, let's say,
the same container.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.600
Let me do it in a slightly
different container here, just

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.640
to talk about diffusion.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.180
We'll go back to water
and sugar--

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.070
especially back to water.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.570
Let's say we have a container
here and let's say it just has

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.830
a bunch of-- let's say it just
has some air particles in it.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.560
It could be anything-- oxygen
or carbon dioxide.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.880
So let me just draw a couple
of air molecules here.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.060
So let's say that that is a
gaseous-- just for the sake of

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.590
argument-- gaseous oxygen.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.900
So each of this is an O2--
each of those, right?

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.900
And let's say that this is the
current configuration, that

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.710
all of this is a vacuum here
and that there's some

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.220
temperatures.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.490
So these water molecules,
they have some

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:25.280
type of kinetic energy.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.620
They're moving in some type of
random directions right there.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.760
So my question is, what is going
to happen in this type

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.810
of container?

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.710
Well, any of these guys are
going to be randomly bumping

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.770
into each other.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.030
They're more likely to bump into
things in this down-left

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.120
direction than they are in
the up-right direction.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.970
So if this guy was happening
to go in this down-left

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.110
direction, he's going to bump
into something and then

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.070
ricochet into the up-right
direction.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.480
But in the up-right
direction, there's

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.040
nothing to bounce into.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.990
So in general, everything is
moving in random directions,

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.250
but you're more likely
to be able to move in

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.000
the rightward direction.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.500
When you go to the left, you're
more likely to bump

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.130
into something.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:06.090
So it's almost common sense.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.550
Over time, if you just let this
system come to some type

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:11.580
of equilibrium-- I'm not
going to go into detail

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.340
on what that means.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.340
You can watch the thermodynamics
videos if you'd

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.470
like to see that.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.000
You'll eventually see the
container will look

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.140
something like this.

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.200
I can't guarantee it.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.500
There's some probability it
would actually stay like this,

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.920
but very likely that those five
particles are going to

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.970
get relatively spread out.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.790
This is diffusion and so it's
really just the spreading of

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.940
particles or molecules from
high concentration to low

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.140
concentration areas, right?

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.420
In this case, the molecules are
going to spread in that

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.780
direction from a high
concentration to a low

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.130
concentration area.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.920
Now you're saying, Sal,
what is concentration?

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.060
And there's many ways to measure
concentration and you

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.120
can go into molarity and
molality and all of that.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.830
But the very simple idea is, how
much of that particle do

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.900
you have per unit space?

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.780
So here, you have a lot of those
particles per unit space

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.550
and here you have very
few of those

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.850
particles per unit space.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.230
So this is a high concentration
and that's a low

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.970
concentration.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.740
So you could imagine other
experiments like this.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.000
You could imagine a solution
like-- let's do

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.250
something like this.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.820
Let's say I have
two containers.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.230
Let's go back to the
solution situation.

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.720
This was a gas, but I started
off with that example so let's

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.432
stay with that example.

00:05:31.432 --> 00:05:35.530
So let's say that I have a door
right there that's larger

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.370
than either the water or
the sugar molecules.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.305
On either side, I have a bunch
of water molecules.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.300
So I have a lot of
water molecules.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.650
So if I just had water molecules
here-- they're all

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.690
bouncing around in random
directions-- and so the odds

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:01.890
of a water molecule going this
way, equivalent to odds of a

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.590
water molecule going that way,
assuming that both sides have

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.570
the same level of water
molecule, otherwise the

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:07.510
pressures would be different.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.070
But let's say that the top
of this is the same

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.170
as the top of this.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.730
So there's no more pressure
going in one

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:13.790
direction or another.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:17.240
So if for whatever reason, a
bunch more water molecules

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.772
were going in the rightward
direction, then all of a

00:06:18.772 --> 00:06:20.760
sudden this would fill up with
more water and we know that

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.620
that isn't likely to occur.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.200
So this is just two containers
of water.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.340
Now let's put some
solute in it.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.230
Let's dissolve some solute in it
and let's say we do all the

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.630
dissolving on the
left-hand side.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.620
So we put some sugar molecules
on the left-hand side.

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.910
And these are small enough to
fit through this little pipe.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.280
That's one assumption
that I'm making.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.120
So what's going to happen?

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.710
All of these things have some
type of kinetic energy.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.630
They're all bouncing around.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.250
Well, over time, the water's
going back and forth.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.600
This water molecule
might go that way.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.040
That water molecule might go
that way, but they net each

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.810
other out, but over time one of
these big sugar molecules

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.520
will be going in just the
right direction to go

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.470
through-- maybe this guy's,
instead of going that

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.380
direction, he starts off going
in that direction.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:15.630
He goes just through this tunnel
connecting the two

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.050
containers and he'll end
up there, right?

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.320
And this guy will still
be bouncing around.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.570
There's some probability he goes
back, but there's still

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:25.420
more sugar particles
here than there.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:31.350
So there's still more
probability that one of these

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.350
guys will go to that side
than one of these guys

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.340
will go to that side.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:36.980
So you can imagine if you're
doing this with gazillions of

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.650
particles-- I'm only doing it
with four-- over time, the

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.440
particles will have spread out
so that their concentrations

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.550
are roughly equal.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.950
So that maybe you'll have
two here over time.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:49.430
But when you're only dealing
with three or four or five

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.380
particles, there's some
probability it doesn't happen,

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.240
but when you're doing it with a
gazillion and they're super

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.810
small, it's a very, very,
very high likelihood.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.590
But anyway, this whole process--
we went from a

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.460
container of high concentration
to a container

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:06.080
of low concentration and the
particles would have spread

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.530
from the low concentration
container to the high

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:09.590
concentration container.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.130
So they diffused.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.820
This is diffusion.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.880
And just so that we learn some
other words that tend to be

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.800
used with the idea of
diffusion-- when we started

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.260
off, this had a higher
concentration.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:26.715
The left-hand side container
had higher concentration.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:34.130
It's all relative, right?

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:37.480
It's higher than this guy.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.505
And this right here had
a lower concentration.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.450
And there are words
for these things.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.650
This solution with a high
concentration is called a

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.330
hypertonic solution.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:51.730
Let me write that in yellow.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.120
Hyper, in general, meaning
having a lot of something,

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.620
having too much of something.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.925
And this lower concentration
is hypotonic.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.660
You might have heard maybe one
of your relatives, if they

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.730
haven't had a meal in awhile
say, I'm hypoglycemic.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.230
That means that they have
not-- they're feeling

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.910
lightheaded.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:24.800
There's not enough sugar in
their bloodstream and they

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.730
want to pass out so
they want a meal.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.930
If you just had a candy bar,
maybe you're hyperglycemic--

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:32.930
or maybe you're just
hyper in general.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.580
So these are just good
prefixes to know, but

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.650
hypertonic-- you have
a lot of the solute.

00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:40.510
You have a high concentration.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:44.500
And then in hypotonic, not too
much of the solute so you have

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.010
a low concentration.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.130
These are good words to know.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:51.220
So in general, diffusion-- if
there's no barriers to the

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.790
diffusion like we had here, you
will have the solute go

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.820
from a high concentration or
hypertonic solution if they

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:03.490
can travel to a hypotonic
solution, to a hypo, where the

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.520
concentration is lower.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:08.480
Now let's do an interesting
experiment here.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.930
We've talked about diffusion and
so far we've been talking

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.530
about the diffusion of
the solute, right?

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.770
And in general-- and this is not
always the case-- if you

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:19.780
want to be as general as
possible, the solute is

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.400
whatever you have less of,
the solvent is whatever

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.510
you have more of.

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.600
And the most common solvent
tends to be water, but it

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.520
doesn't have to be water.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.870
It could be some type
of alcohol.

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:31.390
It could be mercury.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.880
It could be a whole set of
molecules, but water in most

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.130
biological or chemical systems
tends to be the

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.460
most typical solvent.

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.920
It's what other things
are dissolved into.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.380
But what happens if we have a
tunnel where the solute is too

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:51.060
big to travel, but water is
small enough to travel?

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:55.370
Let's think about
that situation.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:57.090
In order to think about it,
I'm going to do something

00:10:57.090 --> 00:10:58.830
interesting.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:02.670
Let's say we have a
container here.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:03.950
Actually, I won't even
draw a container.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.190
Let's just say we have an
outside environment that has a

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:09.260
bunch of water.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:12.630
This is the outside environment
and then you have

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.880
some type of membrane.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.040
Water can go in and out
of this membrane.

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.190
So it's semi-permeable.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.520
Well, it's permeable to water,
but the solute cannot go

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:27.110
through the membrane.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:28.680
So let's say that the
solute is sugar.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:33.060
So we have water on
the outside and

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.126
also inside the membrane.

00:11:36.126 --> 00:11:39.380
So these are little small
water molecules.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.950
This is a membrane right here.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.520
And let's say that we have some
sugar molecules again--

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:47.560
I'm just picking on sugar.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.760
It could have been anything.

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:51.050
So we have some sugar molecules
here that are just a

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:55.950
little bit bigger-- or they
could be a lot bigger.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:11:57.750
Actually, they're a lot bigger
than water molecules.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.700
You have a bunch of-- and I only
draw four, but you have a

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:01.210
gazillion of them, right?

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.470
You have that much more
water molecules.

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:05.325
I'm just trying to show you have
more water molecules than

00:12:05.325 --> 00:12:06.290
sugar molecules.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:07.645
And this membrane is
semi-permeable.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:15.210
Permeable means it allows
things to pass.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:18.070
Semi-permeables means it's
not completely permeable.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.650
So semi-permeable-- in this
context, I'm saying I allow

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.440
water to pass through
the membrane.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:28.850
So water can pass,
but sugar cannot.

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.100
Sugar is too large.

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.220
So if we were to zoom in on the
actual membrane itself--

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:40.580
maybe the membrane
looks like this.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.980
I'm going to zoom in
on this membrane.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:48.620
So it has little holes in the
membrane, just like that.

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.270
And maybe the water molecules
are about that size.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.820
So they can go through
those holes.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.250
So the water molecules can go
back and forth through the

00:12:56.250 --> 00:13:01.520
holes, but the sugar molecules
are about that big.

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:04.990
So they cannot go through
that hole.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.280
They're too big for this opening
right here to go back

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.830
and forth between them.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.680
Now what do you think is going
to happen in this situation?

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.330
So first of all, let's
use our terminology.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:15.720
Remember, sugar is our solute.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.120
Water is our solvent.

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.930
Semi-permeable membrane.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.400
Which side of the membrane
has a higher or lower

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.330
concentration of solute?

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:25.690
Well, the inside does.

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:27.060
The inside is hypertonic.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.540
The outside has a lower

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.850
concentration so it's hypotonic.

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.680
Now, if these openings were big
enough, based on what we

00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.330
just talked about-- these guys
are bouncing around, water is

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.700
travelling in either direction,
and equal

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.520
probability or-- actually
I'm going to talk

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.360
about that in a second.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.660
If everything was wide open, it
would be equal probability,

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.780
but if it was wide open, these
guys eventually would bounce

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:06.450
their ways over to this side and
you'd probably end up with

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.500
equal concentrations
eventually.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.710
And so you would have your
traditional diffusion, where

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.130
high concentration
of solute to low

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:14.530
concentrations of solute.

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:17.350
But in this case, these
guys-- they can't

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:18.330
fit through the hole.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:20.160
Only water can go
back and forth.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:25.180
If these guys were not here,
water would have an equal

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:28.780
likelihood of going in this
direction as they would be

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:33.940
going in that direction, a
completely equal likelihood.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:40.090
But because these guys are on
the right-hand side of-- or in

00:14:40.090 --> 00:14:42.290
this case, on the inside
of our membrane.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:47.000
This is our inside of our
membrane zoomed up-- it's less

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.440
likely because these guys
might be in the approach

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:55.230
position of the holes-- that's
slightly less likely for water

00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:58.110
to be in the approach position
for the holes so it's actually

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:02.720
more probable that water could
enter than water exit.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.180
And I want to make
that very clear.

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.150
If these sugar molecules were
not here, obviously it's

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:09.830
equally likely for water to
go in either direction.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:12.730
Now that these sugar molecules
are there, these sugar

00:15:12.730 --> 00:15:15.290
molecules might be on
the right-hand side.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:18.200
They might be blocking-- I guess
the best way to think

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:20.430
about it is blocking the
approach to the hole.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.060
They'll never be able to go
through the hole themselves

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.490
and might not even be blocking
the hole, but they're going in

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:25.720
some random direction.

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:29.580
So if a water molecule was
approaching-- it's all

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.360
probabilistic and we're dealing
with gazillions of

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.610
molecules-- it's that much more
likely to be blocked to

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:35.360
get outside.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.620
But the water molecules from the
outside-- there's nothing

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:40.170
blocking them to get in so
you're going to have a flow of

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:41.480
water inside.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:44.310
So in this situation, with a
semi-permeable membrane,

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:45.700
you're going to have water.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.280
You're going to have a net
inward flow of water.

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.430
And so this is kind
of interesting.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:56.900
We have the solvent flowing from
a hypotonic situation to

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:59.600
a hypertonic solution,
but it's only

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.210
hypotonic in the solute.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:11.620
But water-- if you flip it the
other way-- if you've used

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.290
sugar as the solvent, then you
could say, we're going from a

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:19.470
high concentration of water to
a low concentration of water.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:20.370
I don't want to confuse
you too much.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:23.090
This is what tends to confuse
people, but just think about

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:24.040
what's going to happen.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.260
No matter in what situation,
the solution is going to do

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:30.000
what it can to try to
equilibriate the

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:30.680
concentration.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.080
To make the concentrations
on both

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.710
sides as close as possible.

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:35.150
And it's not just some magic.

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:36.160
It's not like the
solution knows.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.300
It's all based on probabilities
and these things

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.050
bumping around, but in this
situation, water is more

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:43.790
likely to flow into
the container.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:46.700
So it's actually going to go
from the hypotonic side when

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.460
we talk about low concentration
of solute to the

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:53.690
side that has high
concentrations of solute, of

00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:57.320
sugar-- and actually, if this
thing is stretchable, more

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:01.670
water will keep flowing
in and this membrane

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.420
will stretch out.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:08.420
I won't go to too much detail
here, but this idea of water--

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:12.470
of the solvent-- if in this
case, water is the solvent--

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.150
of water as a solvent
diffusing through a

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.500
semi-permeable membrane,
this is called osmosis.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:25.170
You've probably heard learning
by osmosis-- if you put a book

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.200
against your head, maybe it'll
just seep into your brain.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.000
Same idea.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.500
That's where the word
comes from.

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.570
This idea of water seeping
through membranes to try to

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.600
make concentrations
more equal.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:38.370
So if you say, well, I have high
concentration here, low

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:39.490
concentration here.

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:43.020
If there was no membrane here,
these big molecules would

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:48.080
exit, but because there's this
semi-permeable membrane here,

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:48.680
they can't.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.400
So the system just
probabilistically-- no magic

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:56.090
here-- more water will enter
to try to equilibriate

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.160
concentration.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.970
Eventually-- if maybe there's a
few molecules out here-- not

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:06.440
as high concentration here--
eventually if everything was

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.970
allowed to happen fully, you'll
get to the point where

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:11.120
you have just as many--
you have just as high

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.650
concentration on this side as
you have on the right-hand

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.500
side because this right-hand
side is going to fill with

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.380
water and also probably become
a larger volume.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:21.520
And then, once again, the
probabilities of a water

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:23.600
molecule going to the right and
to the left will be the

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.920
same and you'll get to some
type of equilibrium.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.910
But I want to make it very
clear-- diffusion is the idea

00:18:29.910 --> 00:18:33.130
of any particle going from
higher concentration and

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.740
spreading into a region that has
a lower concentration and

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.950
just spreading out.

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:41.240
Osmosis is the diffusion
of water.

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.210
And usually you're talking about
the diffusion of water

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:47.010
as a solvent and usually it's
in the context of a

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:51.260
semi-permeable membrane, where
the actual solute cannot

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:53.530
travel through the membrane.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:55.800
Anyway, hopefully you've
found that useful and

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.880
not completely confusing.
