00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.650
I've told you multiple times
that the derivative of a curve

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.170
at a point is the slope of the
tangent line, but our

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.670
friend [? Akosh ?]

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.880
sent me a problem where it
actually wants you to find the

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.940
equation of the tangent line.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.550
And I realize, I've never
actually done that.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:16.840
So it's worthwhile.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:17.540
So let's do that.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.370
So it says, find the equation
of the tangent line to the

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:34.950
function f of x is equal to x e
to the x at x is equal to 1.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.130
So let's just get an intuition
of what we're even looking for.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.550
So this function is going to
look something like, I actually

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.150
graphed it, because it's not
a trivial function to graph.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.340
So this is x e to the x,
this is what it looks like.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.120
I'm just using a graphing
calculator, and you can

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.910
see, I just typed it in.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.680
And what this is
asking us, is ok.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.310
At the point, x is equal to 1.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.440
So this is the point
x is equal to one.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.130
So f of x is going to be
someplace up here, and

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.540
actually, f of x is going
to be equal to e, right?

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.220
Because f of 1 is
equal to what?

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.630
1 times e to the 1.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.950
So it equals e.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.170
So we're saying at the point,
at the point 1 comma e, so at

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.220
the point 1 comma 2.71,
whatever, whatever.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.420
So that's what point?

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.740
That's this point.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.780
So it's right here.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.370
2 point, this is e right
here, the point 1 comma e.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.320
So we want to do is figure
out the equation of the

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.690
line tangent to this point.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.810
So what we're going to do, is
we're going to solve it by

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.540
figuring out its slope, which
is just the derivative

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.310
at that point.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.860
So we have to figure
out the derivative at

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.140
exactly this point.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.410
And then we use what we learned
from algebra 1 to figure out

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.970
its equation, and we'll graph
it here, just to confirm that

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.010
we actually figured out the
equation of the tangent line.

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.730
So the first thing we want to
know is the slope of the

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.850
tangent line, and that's just
the derivative at this point.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.840
When x is equal to 1, or
at the point 1 comma e.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.900
So what's the
derivative of this?

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.030
So f prime of x.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.370
f prime of x is equal to,
well, this looks like a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.100
job for the product rule.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.080
Because we know how to figure
out the derivative of x, we

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.940
know how to figure out the
derivative of e to the x, and

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.370
they're just multiplying
by each other.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.140
So the product rules help us.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.105
The derivative of this thing
is going to be equal to the

00:02:18.105 --> 00:02:20.100
derivative of the first
expression of the

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.820
first function.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.810
So the derivative of x is just
1, times the second function,

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.220
times e to the x, plus the
first function, x, times the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.050
derivative of the
second function.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.430
So what's the derivative
of e to the x?

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.280
And that's what I find so
amazing about the number e, or

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.015
the function e to the x, is
that the derivative of e

00:02:42.015 --> 00:02:43.710
to the x is e to the x.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.840
The slope at any point of
this curve is equal to the

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.760
value of the function.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.570
So this is the derivative.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.385
So what is the derivative of
this function at the point x

00:02:53.385 --> 00:02:55.560
is equal to 1, or at
the point 1 comma e?

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.610
So we just evaluate it.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:06.080
We say f prime of 1 is equal to
1 time e to the 1 plus 1 times

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.150
e to the 1, well, that's
just equal e plus e.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.585
And that's just equal to 2 e.

00:03:14.585 --> 00:03:17.220
And you know, we could figure
out what that number, e is just

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.880
a constant number, but we write
e because it's easier to write

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.060
e than 2.7 et cetera, and an
infinite number of digits,

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.170
so we just write 2e.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.240
So this is the slope of the
equation, or this is the slope

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.090
of the curve when x is equal to
one, or at the point

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.440
1e, or 1 f of 1.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.760
So what is the equation
of the tangent line?

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.350
So let's go ahead and take this
form, the equation's going to

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.460
be y is equal to, I'm just
writing it in the, you know,

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.090
not the point slope, the mx
plus b form that you

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.840
learned in algebra.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.570
So the slope is going to be 2e.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.430
We just learned that here.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.300
That's the derivative
when x is equal to 1.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:02.220
So 2e times x plus
the y-intercept.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.120
So if we can figure out
the y-intercept of this

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.790
line, we are done.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.230
We have figured out the
equation of the tangent line.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.690
So how do we do that?

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.960
Well, if we knew a y or
an x where this equation

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.080
goes through, we could
then solve for b.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.230
And we know a y and x that
satisfies this equation.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.410
The point 1 comma e.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.770
The point where we're trying to
find the tangent line, right?

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.360
So this point, 1 comma e,
this is where we want to

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.510
find the tangent line.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:30.870
And by definition, the
tangent line is going to

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.080
go through that point.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.002
So let's substitute those
points back in here, or this

00:04:37.002 --> 00:04:41.050
point back into this equation,
and then solve for b.

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:48.170
So y is equal to e, is equal to
2 e, that's just the slope at

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.040
that point, times x,
times 1, plus b.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.620
It might confuse you, because
e, you'll say, oh, e,

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.030
is that a variable?

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.800
No, it's a number,
remember, it's like pi.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.220
It's a number.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.900
You can substitute 2.7 whatever
there, but we're not doing

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.340
that, because this is cleaner.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.100
And let's solve.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.000
So you get e is
equal to 2e plus b.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.880
Let's subtract 2e
from both sides.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.030
You get b is equal
to e minus 2e.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.430
b is equal to minus e.

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.010
Now we're done.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.940
What's the equation
of the tangent line?

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:29.670
It is y is equal to
2 times e x plus b.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.000
But b is minus e,
so it's minus e.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.950
So this is the equation
of the tangent line.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.270
If you don't like these e's
there, you could replace that

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:40.920
with the number 2.7 et cetera,
and this would become 5 point

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.780
something, and this would
just be minus 2.7 something.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.920
But this looks neater.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.830
And let's confirm.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.550
Let's use this little graphing
calculator to confirm that that

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:53.140
really is the equation
of the tangent line.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.910
So let me type it in here.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:13.330
So it's 2, 2 times e times x,
right, that's 2ex minus e.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.240
And let us graph this line.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.200
There we go.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.100
It graphed it.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.860
And notice that that line, that
green line, I don't know if you

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.700
can, maybe I need to make this
bigger for it to

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:26.920
show up, bolder.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.830
I don't know if that helps.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.800
But if you look here, so this
red, this is our original

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.390
equation, x e to the
x, that's this curve.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.810
We want to know equation
of the tangent line

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.530
at x is equal to 1.

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:44.035
So it's the point
x is equal to 1.

00:06:44.035 --> 00:06:47.990
And when x is equal to 1, f of
x is e, right, you can just

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.900
substitute back into the
original equation to get that.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.710
So this is the
point, 1 comma e.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:55.470
So the equation of the tangent
line, its slope is going to be

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:56.800
the derivative at this point.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.410
So we solved the derivative of
this function, and evaluated

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.310
it at x is equal to 1.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:03.910
That's what we did here.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:06.970
We figured out the derivative,
evaluated x equals 1.

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.200
And so we said, OK, the slope.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:15.970
The slope at when x is equal to
1 and y is equal to e, the

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:18.640
slope at that point
is equal to 2e.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.630
And we figured that out
from the derivative.

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.840
And then we just used our
algebra 1 skills to figure out

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.230
the equation of that line.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.160
And how did we do that?

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.450
We knew the slope, because
that's just the derivative

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.250
at that point.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.590
And then we just have to
solve for the y-intercept.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:36.100
And the way we did that is we
said, well, the point 1 comma e

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:38.250
is on this green line as well.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.420
So we substituted that in, and
solve for our y-intercept,

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.930
which we got as minus e, and
notice that this line

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.200
intersects the y-axis at minus
e, that's about minus

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.420
2.7 something.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:49.230
And there we have it.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:52.700
We have shown that, and
visually, it shows that

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.890
this is the tangent line.

00:07:54.890 --> 00:07:59.380
Anyway, hope you found
that vaguely useful.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:01.400
If you did, you should
thank [? Akosh ?]

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:05.110
for being unusually persistent,
and having me do this problem.

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.000
See you in the next video.
