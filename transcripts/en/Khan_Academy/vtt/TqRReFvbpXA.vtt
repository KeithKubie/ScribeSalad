00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:08.540
Let's multiply 7 times
253 and see what we get.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.760
So just like in the last
example, what I like to do

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.690
is I like to rewrite the
largest number first.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.079
So that's 253.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.260
And then write the
smaller number below it

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.160
and align the
place value, the 7.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.840
It only has a ones place, so
I'll put the 7 right over here

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.849
below the ones place in 253.

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.140
And then put the multiplication
symbol right over here.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.850
So you could read
this as 253 times 7,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.040
which we know is the same
thing as 7 times 253.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.690
And now we are ready to compute.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.280
And there are many
ways of doing this,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.760
but this one you could
call the standard way.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.760
So what I do is I
start with my 7.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.420
And I multiply it times
each of the numbers up here,

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.750
and I carry appropriately.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.840
So first I start with 7 times 3.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.242
Well, 7 times 3 we know is 21.

00:00:53.242 --> 00:00:54.200
Let me write that down.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.120
7 times 3 is equal to 21.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.620
You could do this
part in your head,

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.670
but I just want to
make it clear where

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.210
I'm getting these numbers from.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.040
What I would do in
the standard method

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.000
is I would write the
1 into 21 down here,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.680
but then carry the
2 to the tens place.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.405
Now I want to figure
out what 7 times 5 is.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.930
We know from our multiplication
tables that 7 times 5

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.650
is equal to 35.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.870
Now, we can't just somehow
put the 35 down here.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.370
We still have to deal with
this 2 that we carried.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.360
So we compute 7 times 5 is 35,
but then we also add that 2.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.880
So it's 35 plus 2 is 37.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.880
Now, we write the 7 right
over here in the tens

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.710
place and carry the 3.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.230
Now we need to compute
what 7 times 2 is.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:52.920
We know that 7 times 2 is 14
from our multiplication tables.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.410
We can't just put
a 14 down here.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.550
We have this 3 to add.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.420
So 7 times 2 is
14, plus 3 is 17.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.830
So now we can write
the 17 down here,

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.780
because 2 is the last number
that we had to deal with.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.169
And so we have our answer.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.839
7 times 253 is 1,771.
