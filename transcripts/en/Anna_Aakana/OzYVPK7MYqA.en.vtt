00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
You know what I hate?

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.240
"You know I'm about to leave to go to an audition soon, I just-

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.300
Where's my phone?!

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.380
Oh my god, babe, I can't find my phone

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.560
I don't know where I had it last

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.200
OH MY GOD, BABE! WHAT DO I D-"

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.260
Yes, I hate that a lot, I feel very stupid when that happens

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.600
But even more than that, I hate it when I hear women say things like this:

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.220
"I'm not like other women"

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.100
Or this:

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.140
"I don't know, I just don't get along with women"

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.940
"Like, at all"

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.180
And I hate it because - that used to be me

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.020
Other women used to intimidate me so much

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.500
And even though I desperately craved their friendship and their acceptance

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.980
In my mind, they didn't think I was good enough

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.980
So I was like "Oh well, it's just so much easier to be friends with guys"

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.460
Women - I don't understand them. For some reason, we just aren't friends"

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.960
The reason being that I never put any effort into talking or getting to know them at all

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.340
And wrote off the entire gender as complicated and full of drama

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:00.560
And this mentality ultimately fucked me out of knowing a lot of amazing women in my teens and my early 20s

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:05.140
So, in the spirit of change, here are some women to actually watch out for:

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.220
Miss Melissa Hunter, most notably known for adult Wednesday Addams

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.960
Has also done a Wolfgirl pilot on NBC and is now working with True TV on Small Victories

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.900
Miss Beth Stelling is one of my favorite comedians

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.840
But not only that, she spoke up earlier this year about some sexual assault and abuse she endured

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.820
And is now turning that tragedy into jokes in her stand-up set, which is beautiful and hard and I commend her for it

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.240
And finally, Miss Maggie Levin, my writing partner and director extraordinaire

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.640
She writes amazing fantasy screenplays and directs Rocky Horror every year

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:46.480
Plus she has like, this flat-faced dog named Spud. Oh, he's so cute, he just wheezes and he like, struggles to exist and it's a beautiful thing

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.600
I love dogs now

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.460
Uh, let me know which women I should watch out for down below or tweet at me

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.060
