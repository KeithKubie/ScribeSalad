background capability of South Korea the
United States working together to

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230
United States working together to
 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.570
United States working together to
practice and prepare their militaries to

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580
practice and prepare their militaries to
 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.150
practice and prepare their militaries to
defend South Korea at the same time

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160
defend South Korea at the same time
 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.070
defend South Korea at the same time
North Korea's military North Korea has

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080
North Korea's military North Korea has
 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.960
North Korea's military North Korea has
not substantially invested in

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970
not substantially invested in
 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.539
not substantially invested in
conventional military capability in a

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549
conventional military capability in a
 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.370
conventional military capability in a
number of years they've been spending

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380
number of years they've been spending
 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.289
number of years they've been spending
all of their investment effectively on

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299
all of their investment effectively on
 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.180
all of their investment effectively on
their nuclear program because they have

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190
their nuclear program because they have
 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.909
their nuclear program because they have
understood that conventional capability

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919
understood that conventional capability
 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.380
understood that conventional capability
they were not going to be able to go on

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390
they were not going to be able to go on
 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.090
they were not going to be able to go on
the offense that's just been off the

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100
the offense that's just been off the
 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.460
the offense that's just been off the
table for them the

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470
table for them the
 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.380
table for them the
have a deterrent capability in the

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390
have a deterrent capability in the
 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.750
have a deterrent capability in the
threat to use artillery to attack Seoul

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760
threat to use artillery to attack Seoul
 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.500
threat to use artillery to attack Seoul
but that was not as good a deterrent

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510
but that was not as good a deterrent
 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.360
but that was not as good a deterrent
capability from their perspective as

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370
capability from their perspective as
 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.640
capability from their perspective as
having nuclear weapons would be and so

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650
having nuclear weapons would be and so
 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.860
having nuclear weapons would be and so
they've been relying on that

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870
they've been relying on that
 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.200
they've been relying on that
conventional artillery deterrent

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210
conventional artillery deterrent
 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.420
conventional artillery deterrent
capability to kind of get them through

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430
capability to kind of get them through
 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.310
capability to kind of get them through
to bridge through while their nuclear

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320
to bridge through while their nuclear
 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.350
to bridge through while their nuclear
program was gearing up but all of their

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360
program was gearing up but all of their
 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.300
program was gearing up but all of their
money went into their nuclear program

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310
money went into their nuclear program
 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.670
money went into their nuclear program
so North Korea's conventional forces are

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680
so North Korea's conventional forces are
 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.170
so North Korea's conventional forces are
simply not postured trained prepared to

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180
simply not postured trained prepared to
 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.450
simply not postured trained prepared to
go on the offense so we're not creating

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460
go on the offense so we're not creating
 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.210
go on the offense so we're not creating
an instant problem for South Korea by

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220
an instant problem for South Korea by
 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.850
an instant problem for South Korea by
suspending the war games we want to be

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860
suspending the war games we want to be
 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.340
suspending the war games we want to be
on the defense but in terms of the way

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350
on the defense but in terms of the way
 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.770
on the defense but in terms of the way
we train our military to fight and the

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780
we train our military to fight and the
 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:18.080
we train our military to fight and the
investments that we make in our military

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090
investments that we make in our military
 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.560
investments that we make in our military
the operational concepts that we use we

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570
the operational concepts that we use we
 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:24.620
the operational concepts that we use we
have an offensive operational concept

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630
have an offensive operational concept
 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.250
have an offensive operational concept
today so what we say is the way that we

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260
today so what we say is the way that we
 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.120
today so what we say is the way that we
want to defend our allies is by

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130
want to defend our allies is by
 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.820
want to defend our allies is by
threatening to attack to punish other

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830
threatening to attack to punish other
 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.730
threatening to attack to punish other
countries for attacking our friends so

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740
countries for attacking our friends so
 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.320
countries for attacking our friends so
we want to always have the ability to

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330
we want to always have the ability to
 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.330
we want to always have the ability to
project power and go on the offense

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340
project power and go on the offense
 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.880
project power and go on the offense
against countries like China so if we

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890
against countries like China so if we
 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.100
against countries like China so if we
actually got into a war where we had the

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110
actually got into a war where we had the
 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.170
actually got into a war where we had the
requirement to defend Japan or defend

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.180
requirement to defend Japan or defend
 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.570
requirement to defend Japan or defend
Taiwan or defend any of our allies from

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580
Taiwan or defend any of our allies from
 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.360
Taiwan or defend any of our allies from
China our current military doctrine in

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370
China our current military doctrine in
 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.180
China our current military doctrine in
the United States says that we will fire

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190
the United States says that we will fire
 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.210
the United States says that we will fire
missiles and attack the Chinese homeland

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:02.220
missiles and attack the Chinese homeland
 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.890
missiles and attack the Chinese homeland
as a way of defending our allies so we

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900
as a way of defending our allies so we
 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.920
as a way of defending our allies so we
have an offensive defense today but

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930
have an offensive defense today but
 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.230
have an offensive defense today but
given military technology and the

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240
given military technology and the
 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.390
given military technology and the
tremendous opportunities to make it hard

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400
tremendous opportunities to make it hard
 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.990
tremendous opportunities to make it hard
to project power into another country if

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000
to project power into another country if
 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.930
to project power into another country if
our strategic aims are truly defensive

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940
our strategic aims are truly defensive
 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.330
our strategic aims are truly defensive
if we want to defend Japan and defend

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340
if we want to defend Japan and defend
 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.090
if we want to defend Japan and defend
Taiwan we don't need an offensive

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100
Taiwan we don't need an offensive
 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.700
Taiwan we don't need an offensive
defense military technology is making it

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:28.710
defense military technology is making it
 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.980
defense military technology is making it
easier for the United States to have a

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990
easier for the United States to have a
 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.159
easier for the United States to have a
defensive defense we should reshape our

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169
defensive defense we should reshape our
 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:35.780
defensive defense we should reshape our
military investment in our military

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:35.790
military investment in our military
 

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.640
military investment in our military
training and our military planning

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:37.650
training and our military planning
 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.730
training and our military planning
around a defensive defense instead of an

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740
around a defensive defense instead of an
 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.330
around a defensive defense instead of an
offensive defense

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:42.340
offensive defense
 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:50.320
