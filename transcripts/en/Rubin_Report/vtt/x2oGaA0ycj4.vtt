[inaudible]

2
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.270
<v 1>joining me today as a trial lawyer focusing on civil,</v>

3
00:00:07.271 --> 00:00:11.470
criminal and constitutional law.
And according to his Twitter bio,

4
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.030
he's America's most successful political gambler.
Robert Barnes,

5
00:00:16.031 --> 00:00:17.620
welcome to the Rubin report,
having to be here.

6
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.380
I am glad to have you here because you sir,

7
00:00:20.381 --> 00:00:25.381
are smack Dab in the middle of a million things that I'm thinking about all the

8
00:00:25.721 --> 00:00:29.560
time.
So I'm glad we're doing this.
Before we do anything related to civil,

9
00:00:29.561 --> 00:00:34.450
criminal,
constitutional,
or any other kind of law,
political gambler,

10
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.760
what or what are we talking about there?
I know what we're talking about,

11
00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:37.480
but tell the people.

12
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.730
<v 2>Sure.
I started doing when I was real young,
so the,</v>

13
00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:42.670
I used to bet friends and other people with elections and then started doing,

14
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.680
it became sort of legal loosely in 2004 so I started betting on presidential

15
00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:52.300
elections.
I know sort of a side hobby until the Trump election and Trump,

16
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.270
I thought this was a very moneymaking opportunity.

17
00:00:55.271 --> 00:00:58.390
The British betting markets are now much bigger than they ever used to be.

18
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.710
So I could bet as much money as I possibly could.
And,
and,
and,

19
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.860
and basically dug in much deeper than I had before.

20
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.070
So I had sort of been around politics but hadn't done in deep for maybe,

21
00:01:10.071 --> 00:01:12.370
you know,
20 years or so.
I mean I've been very active,

22
00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:13.370
but then it become inactive.

23
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.330
It become skeptical of the political process and decided,

24
00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:18.160
well I should really dig in.
And as part of this,

25
00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.820
I discovered this whole emerging movement and a cross section of areas and what

26
00:01:21.821 --> 00:01:23.130
was happening at geologically.

27
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.500
So I became involved for other political and legal reasons along the way.

28
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.740
It was sort of like a Scott Adams when big league kind of thing where you get

29
00:01:29.741 --> 00:01:32.350
the six there somewhere exactly,
exactly.

30
00:01:32.351 --> 00:01:35.110
Where you get like six degrees of separation.
You're trying to learn this.

31
00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:38.440
You ended up learning four or five other things in the process.
And so I,

32
00:01:38.441 --> 00:01:40.390
you know,
I went to the Republican National Convention,

33
00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:43.240
the Democratic National Convention traveled across the country,

34
00:01:43.241 --> 00:01:46.480
talk to tons of people,
dug into what was happening in the social media space,

35
00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:49.120
the reddit space,
the Twitter space.
I didn't know what Twitter was.

36
00:01:49.121 --> 00:01:53.930
And so then really I knew some bird things.
A happier time.
Exactly.
It was,
uh,

37
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.840
and maybe youtube was still youtube,
you know,
it wasn't sensor too.
So the,
I was,

38
00:01:58.841 --> 00:02:02.170
uh,
you know,
involved and invested in it,
went over to the UK,

39
00:02:02.171 --> 00:02:05.710
placed a lot of big bets.
Uh,
they thought I was nuts when I was doing it.

40
00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:07.960
There was like,
you know how Trump's not going to get elected.

41
00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:10.720
That was the sort of consensus.
So much so that one of the big books,

42
00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:14.170
Patty power actually was paying out Hillary Clinton beds before the election.

43
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.570
So if you had been on Hillary Clinton with Patty power,

44
00:02:16.571 --> 00:02:19.610
they acted like you had already won and paid you out.
Are they,

45
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.740
are they still in business?
They are business.
Uh,

46
00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.560
though they took a huge hit on the election after they've taken a big hit on

47
00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:28.780
Brexit,
which I'd been on before that.

48
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.270
And then after that had bet on various European elections.

49
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.730
So it was just understanding how the electorate works.

50
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.900
I'm a sports better as well and being able to predict and forecast elections was

51
00:02:37.901 --> 00:02:41.950
fun and it was a way to just make extra money and in the process ended up having

52
00:02:41.951 --> 00:02:45.640
this whole life experience that was fun and entertaining and very profitable.

53
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.500
<v 1>Can I ask you what kind of profits?
We're talking</v>

54
00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.390
<v 2>about half a million dollars.
Yeah,
it's very nice.
If I could admit that.</v>

55
00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:54.760
If I could a bit more I would've bet more.
Yeah.
There was only limits.

56
00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:58.570
As an American you only have access to the individual betting shops.

57
00:02:58.571 --> 00:03:02.320
You can't get the Betfair and the bet trade in markets.
If I could,

58
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:04.360
I could have made seven figures,
but they use it would have been

59
00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.960
<v 1>nice cheese.
All right,
well there's a lot to talk about there but,</v>

60
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.660
but I really want to focus on some of the legal stuff because we chatted a

61
00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:14.950
little bit in the green room.
I'm starting to think as much as much.

62
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:18.340
I obviously am a free speech guy and we're going to talk all about the first

63
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:18.671
amendment,

64
00:03:18.671 --> 00:03:23.350
all sorts of things that the way the world is going right now with the platforms

65
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:26.860
and with the trolls and with the anonymous accounts and with the targeted

66
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:30.820
harassment and with the way that we see media members attacking kids,

67
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:33.600
which you're very intimately involved with and a whole bunch of others have.

68
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.670
I'm starting to think we really need some legal answers to some of these

69
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:39.521
problems,

70
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:43.480
which is really against my default position as a person in terms of speech.

71
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:46.510
And that's exactly why I wanted to have you here.
So before we get to all that,

72
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.120
um,
just tell me a little bit about your legal history.

73
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:52.570
When did you even get interested in law and what sort of made you say,
all right,

74
00:03:52.571 --> 00:03:55.030
I'm going to be a lawyer.
Lawyers are that well liked.

75
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.050
<v 2>Exactly.
Well,
you know,</v>

76
00:03:57.051 --> 00:04:00.140
I've always liked underdog representation and that sort of what my legal

77
00:04:00.141 --> 00:04:01.940
practice is and that goes back to I was a kid.

78
00:04:01.941 --> 00:04:03.620
My favorite TV show is the equalizer.

79
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.490
Equalize the odds and to represent people against,

80
00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.130
even if I'm representing someone that's famous or well known,

81
00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.340
they're stacked up against someone that has more institutional power or wealth

82
00:04:13.341 --> 00:04:15.920
or the u s government behind it.
And so I was a kid,

83
00:04:15.921 --> 00:04:19.280
I like shows like Matlock and Perry Mason and that was part of it.

84
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.450
And you'd see lawyers as being integral to the process of making meaningful

85
00:04:23.451 --> 00:04:26.390
change and particularly to stand up for people who couldn't stand up for

86
00:04:26.391 --> 00:04:29.300
themselves and use our legal system and legal rights to,

87
00:04:29.301 --> 00:04:31.100
to accomplish and achieve those objectives.

88
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.290
And so that's why the law always appealed to me.

89
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.260
It didn't appeal to me from a moneymaking perspective,
though I've been very,

90
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.500
you know,
had been lucky in that regard.
Uh,

91
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.870
it appealed to me and didn't appear to appeal to me on a status basis.

92
00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:44.150
It appealed to me is I can make a difference for little people.

93
00:04:44.151 --> 00:04:47.720
People like my father who spoke out his whole life and there's a,

94
00:04:47.721 --> 00:04:49.840
and often was punished for it.
And the,
uh,

95
00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.770
there's the old biblical proverb that says,

96
00:04:51.771 --> 00:04:54.860
the sins of the father will be visited on the sun.
I always say,
well,

97
00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:57.440
the sins against the father or long remembered by the sun.

98
00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:01.700
And so he was mistreated and maltreated because he stood up,
not for himself,

99
00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:03.830
but for other people in a wide range of environments.

100
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.410
And I just wanted to equalize the playing field if I could.

101
00:05:06.411 --> 00:05:09.290
And was he a lawyer also?
No,
he wasn't.
He was,
he was an accountant,

102
00:05:09.291 --> 00:05:11.990
but it wasn't a certified public accountant.
Uh,
so the,

103
00:05:11.991 --> 00:05:15.080
he went through all the craziness that it was my first experience with the

104
00:05:15.081 --> 00:05:19.070
credentialing society here.
My father was a very skilled and gifted account it,

105
00:05:19.071 --> 00:05:21.460
but because he wasn't a certified public accountant,

106
00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.900
he'd grown up in an era where that wasn't necessary.
Uh,

107
00:05:23.901 --> 00:05:26.060
he couldn't get the kind of jobs that other people could do.

108
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.870
And so he was often both overqualified or underqualified for employment.

109
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:33.620
And then he had a habit of standing up for people who are being maltreated or

110
00:05:33.621 --> 00:05:36.680
mistreated in his work environment or other environment,
which led to him.

111
00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.720
And he ended up being a newspaper.
We got delivery guy.

112
00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.120
So when I was a little kid,
we used delivering newspapers,

113
00:05:41.121 --> 00:05:45.830
throwing him outside the door.
He,
we did a morning round and afternoon route.
Uh,

114
00:05:45.831 --> 00:05:47.480
and then you end up doing inventory work.

115
00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:49.610
So he just picked up whatever blue collar work he could.

116
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.630
So even though his education and his intellectual capabilities far exceeded what

117
00:05:53.631 --> 00:05:54.830
he could get economically,

118
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:59.150
it was a product or a side effect of the society and the ability of more

119
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:02.720
powerful people to take advantage and misuse and abuse that power against the

120
00:06:02.721 --> 00:06:04.010
less powerful people like himself.

121
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.950
<v 1>Wow.
So,
all right.
So let's flash forward a little bit to what,</v>

122
00:06:07.951 --> 00:06:12.270
what may maybe one or two of the cases that kind of got you,

123
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.720
got you sort of on the map so that now you've become one of the sort of,

124
00:06:15.721 --> 00:06:19.530
I think one of the central legal figures in the free speech battle.

125
00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.970
<v 2>So I started out doing all kinds of free speech representation represented</v>

126
00:06:22.971 --> 00:06:24.320
victims of domestic violence,

127
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.810
was suing big banks before anybody was doing big banks.

128
00:06:26.811 --> 00:06:30.890
And subprime lending was a,
I had clerked for a native American tribe.

129
00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:33.860
I'd clerked for a big corporate law firm.
I'd clerked for a street lawyer.

130
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.260
I always say,
if anybody wants to learn legal education,

131
00:06:36.261 --> 00:06:37.790
just read all of John Grisham's books,

132
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:41.210
you'll get a good sense of the legal practice really works.
Um,

133
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.930
and worked for a big high profile plaintiff's lawyer and finally got to a space

134
00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:46.760
where I could do the kind of cases I wanted to do.

135
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.580
And I liked first amendment cases and it happened to parallel and two areas of

136
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.680
law.
One was civil where I was representing Ralph Nader.
He went on TV and said,

137
00:06:54.681 --> 00:06:57.590
look,
I'm getting bombarded.
I have no lawyers left to help me.

138
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:00.650
If somebody can please reach out.
I was like,
sure,
I'll take the case.

139
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:03.650
So there was,
I remember we did the case in Arizona was me,

140
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:06.020
Ralph Nader and like 12 lawyers kept coming in.

141
00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:08.750
I kept wondering when the door was going to shut [inaudible] lawyer came in

142
00:07:08.751 --> 00:07:11.180
another,
you had the Democratic Party Republican Party,

143
00:07:11.181 --> 00:07:13.580
both aligned to prevent his access to the ballot,

144
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.120
deny people the right to circulate petitions for the cause or candidate of their

145
00:07:17.121 --> 00:07:21.560
choice.
And so I took that case and it took four years.
A lot of litigation,

146
00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:22.394
a lot of fighting.

147
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.220
But ultimately we've got one of the most important precedents in the country out

148
00:07:25.221 --> 00:07:26.750
of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

149
00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:30.170
It's now one of the most cited cases in the country that protects the right to

150
00:07:30.171 --> 00:07:33.170
circulate petitions,
the right to speak to the context of elections,

151
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.450
the right to choose who you want on the ballot,

152
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.540
the right of third parties and independent candidates to access the ballot.

153
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:42.410
<v 1>In a weird way though,
even though just by the fact that it took four years,</v>

154
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:44.840
isn't that part of the problem right there?
Cause yes,

155
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.990
four years later it's like he doesn't necessarily have the energy to run again

156
00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:51.140
or the movement kind of moves on to something else,
et cetera.

157
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:54.390
<v 2>It was like the beginning of law fair of its own time,
politically motivated,</v>

158
00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:55.131
ideological law,

159
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:58.800
fair to exclude independent and dissident voices from being able to meaningfully

160
00:07:58.801 --> 00:08:00.360
participate in the political process.

161
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.660
And the main goal and objective is to silence the audience,

162
00:08:03.661 --> 00:08:07.140
to not allow the audience to hear or choose or participate in the way they want

163
00:08:07.141 --> 00:08:09.030
to choose.
They don't get to choose their news,

164
00:08:09.031 --> 00:08:10.290
they don't get to choose their views.

165
00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.160
That's what the censorship campaigns were about and that crossed over into

166
00:08:14.161 --> 00:08:17.670
representing people who are accused of being tax protesters and these were

167
00:08:17.671 --> 00:08:20.490
people who had very distinct political views about the way the tax laws were

168
00:08:20.491 --> 00:08:23.730
operating.
They were mostly upfront about it with the IRS.
I mean,

169
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.560
how many people you know,
write letters saying,

170
00:08:25.561 --> 00:08:28.350
I'm not going to pay taxes and here's what some of those,

171
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:30.420
mostly these were libertarians basically.
Right.

172
00:08:30.421 --> 00:08:33.150
It's never somebody that hates the tax system because they want to be taxed
more.

173
00:08:33.151 --> 00:08:35.380
Right,
exactly.
That's never happened.
Precisely.
Exactly,

174
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:36.930
and it's people being open and honest about it.

175
00:08:36.931 --> 00:08:40.440
They're not trying to cheat anybody and I tried to defraud anybody in the US

176
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.140
Supreme Court has had 20 years ago in a case called cheek versus the United

177
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:43.410
States.

178
00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:46.230
They were not supposed to put people in prison for having different beliefs

179
00:08:46.231 --> 00:08:47.130
about the tax laws.

180
00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:50.130
Especially if given this as a country that was founded on people who had very

181
00:08:50.131 --> 00:08:52.230
unique beliefs about the tax laws.
Uh,

182
00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:54.630
so I ended up representing Wesley Snipes in that context.

183
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:59.650
I'd represented him previously when he'd been falsely accused of,
of uh,
of,
uh,

184
00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.720
of parenting a child in New York where they were abusing the family court system

185
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:06.720
to invade his privacy,
to lie in libel them.
Uh,

186
00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.470
and basically t because of his celebrity uses celebrity to make themselves

187
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:15.000
notorious.
Uh,
so we brought a unique civil rights case in that context.
Had One,

188
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:16.680
got them to fold and capitulate.

189
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:20.670
He hired me then to represent them in the criminal case on a whole bunch of tax

190
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:23.280
charges.
Ended up acquitted of all the felony fraud,

191
00:09:23.281 --> 00:09:25.600
conspiracy charges and even half the misdemeanor charge

192
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.710
<v 1>on cases like that.
I'm always curious,
um,</v>

193
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.690
when it's a high profiles rich celebrity and it's tax related,

194
00:09:32.691 --> 00:09:35.630
I always think it's like these people move a guy like Wednesdays Nights,

195
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.750
movie star,
you know,
he's worth millions and millions of dollars.

196
00:09:38.751 --> 00:09:40.820
The idea that he would,
and I don't know the specifics,

197
00:09:40.821 --> 00:09:41.840
so please correct me if I'm wrong,

198
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.230
but the idea that he would know every specific thing that his accountant was

199
00:09:45.231 --> 00:09:47.690
doing all the time seems crazy to me.

200
00:09:47.691 --> 00:09:51.470
Like he's running a business where he's mostly probably focused on acting and

201
00:09:51.471 --> 00:09:55.370
traveling and everything else and it's like the idea that unless he instructed

202
00:09:55.371 --> 00:09:58.730
the guy to do something illegal that you'd end up in jail because if something

203
00:09:58.731 --> 00:10:00.650
like that seems pretty bananas to me

204
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.281
<v 2>completely,</v>

205
00:10:01.281 --> 00:10:04.250
because what had happened with him is he'd had one accountant advisor that he

206
00:10:04.251 --> 00:10:07.150
started to distrust.
He said,
I think this guy's up to something on,

207
00:10:07.151 --> 00:10:10.190
on real estate deals and other deals.
It turned out he was completely right.

208
00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.850
He was trying to tell the New York authorities for years before the guy ended up

209
00:10:13.851 --> 00:10:16.660
getting busted and he had,
this guy was involved with Tom Brokaw.

210
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:19.280
He was representing a whole roster of high profile celebrities.

211
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.410
Turned out he was embezzling from them in mass.

212
00:10:21.411 --> 00:10:23.600
He had abandoned his wife or a stripper long story.

213
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.710
So the this guy ended up going to jail for a long time,
but,
but snipes was like,

214
00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:29.810
hey,
there's a problem here.
And nobody would listen.

215
00:10:29.811 --> 00:10:33.110
And that led them to turn to other professionals and they said,
you know what,

216
00:10:33.111 --> 00:10:36.140
if you have any questions,
we'll go right to the government and get your answers.

217
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.000
And he was like,
well that's gotta be no problem.

218
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.220
They're going to talk to the government.
They'll figure out what it is.

219
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:44.030
That's how this unfolded.
That's how this whole thing unfolded.
It was in fact,

220
00:10:44.031 --> 00:10:48.020
they even tried to delete and destroy all of his letters and correspondence and

221
00:10:48.021 --> 00:10:51.920
communications.
And luckily they were,
he had separately back them up.

222
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:52.611
If he hadn't,

223
00:10:52.611 --> 00:10:55.880
we wouldn't have been able to prove how much he had communicated directly to

224
00:10:55.881 --> 00:10:57.680
them.
He even asked to be audited.
He said,

225
00:10:57.681 --> 00:11:01.250
come in and audit me and then come back and tell me what is it io and why it is

226
00:11:01.251 --> 00:11:02.750
I owe it.
And how does the legal system work?

227
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.630
And this is somewhat rooted in the African American and native American

228
00:11:05.631 --> 00:11:08.930
tradition who has a long history of the law is not being applied the way they're

229
00:11:08.931 --> 00:11:09.950
supposed to be on the books.

230
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:13.610
So the idea that maybe the law is not being applied the way it's supposed to be

231
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.540
wasn't foreign to him.

232
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:17.690
You have native American tribes whose tribal agreements are still not being

233
00:11:17.691 --> 00:11:22.340
enforced.
You have African Americans between 1865 and 1955 in the United States,

234
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.400
like his parents,
like his grandparents who said the law on the books,

235
00:11:25.401 --> 00:11:27.560
that they had the right to participate in the political process,

236
00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:29.570
the right to be on the jury,
the right to run for office,

237
00:11:29.571 --> 00:11:31.370
and yet that wasn't happening in reality.

238
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:35.840
So the idea that there was some mismatch here made sense to him and he just

239
00:11:35.841 --> 00:11:38.240
wanted,
he said,
well,
let's go right to the government and I'm Wesley Snipes.

240
00:11:38.241 --> 00:11:39.290
I have a little bit of a tension.

241
00:11:39.291 --> 00:11:41.810
They'll probably answer my questions at least and then everything will get

242
00:11:41.811 --> 00:11:44.660
resolved.
That's why the jury was shocked by the case.

243
00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.460
This was a very conservative jury.

244
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:50.960
The lead jury foreman was a guy who had been a long time corrections officer and

245
00:11:50.961 --> 00:11:54.460
upstate New York.
They had deliberately manipulated the jury pool they'd picked.

246
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.910
It wasn't really an all white jury pool.
So there was a joke that it was as,
as,

247
00:11:57.911 --> 00:12:01.390
uh,
the only thing more white than the snowfall from the Green Bay packer in New

248
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:04.210
York.
Jack came the day before was the dairy pool in this nice case,

249
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.660
but not in nine of the 12 jurors who are honest and got onto the jury,

250
00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.670
said they didn't think he should be convicted or anything.

251
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.630
There were three jurors who were holdouts who said,
we're,
we're,

252
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.410
we want to convict them of things.
And we came in with,

253
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.350
they admitted they came in with a bias before they became part of the jury.

254
00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.290
So on the misdemeanors,
they did a split verdict.
They said,
well,

255
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:23.110
will convict them on these three misdemeanors even though we don't think he's

256
00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:25.300
guilty of them,
because that will be no problem.

257
00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.510
They didn't know there'd be a wacky sentence because there was shock at the

258
00:12:28.511 --> 00:12:29.530
outcome of the case.

259
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.230
<v 1>So how much of law is just that?</v>

260
00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:38.090
Just the public attention stuff,
manipulating the media.
I don't have to name,

261
00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:40.820
I could probably name a zillion lawyers that seem like they're far more

262
00:12:40.821 --> 00:12:43.100
interested in fame for themselves.

263
00:12:43.101 --> 00:12:48.101
Then doing the right thing and just managing optics rather than getting to just

264
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:50.420
what is right.

265
00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.100
<v 2>Precisely.
That's what it often is.</v>

266
00:12:52.101 --> 00:12:55.460
I mean you're seeing it now in the Roger Stone case where there's an obsession

267
00:12:55.461 --> 00:12:59.750
with silence again and all the people on the media on the left that talked about

268
00:12:59.751 --> 00:13:03.200
free speech and talk about the ability to protect yourself and how our criminal

269
00:13:03.201 --> 00:13:06.470
justice system has problems or suddenly muted when here it is.

270
00:13:06.471 --> 00:13:09.560
You have a judge spending all this time saying maybe we shouldn't allow them to

271
00:13:09.561 --> 00:13:14.360
publish a book.
How has that become part of American criminal justice process?

272
00:13:14.630 --> 00:13:16.670
So the effectively,

273
00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:20.270
it often is defending a person in the court of public opinion because often with

274
00:13:20.271 --> 00:13:22.700
the government is doing is using people as sin goats,

275
00:13:22.701 --> 00:13:26.750
using people as sacrificial lambs,
using people to coerce public opinion,

276
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:29.300
often not really rooted in the facts of the case,

277
00:13:29.301 --> 00:13:32.690
not really rooted in the law of the case targeting people solely because of

278
00:13:32.691 --> 00:13:34.790
their celebrity or their fame.
Uh,

279
00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:38.120
and then you have lawyers who often look at a case and they don't look at the

280
00:13:38.121 --> 00:13:39.800
case about how do I win the case.

281
00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:42.200
They look at how do I get the most press coverage,

282
00:13:42.201 --> 00:13:43.790
how do I get the most media coverage?

283
00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.580
And they often deserve their clients in that context.

284
00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.200
So it's critically important,

285
00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.780
especially in high profile cases to put the client first and to manage the,

286
00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.570
the court of public opinion at the same time.

287
00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:57.220
<v 1>Yeah.
And that cannot be easy,
especially in a day of social media.</v>

288
00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:00.000
I look the fact you're here talking,
so it's not like you're,

289
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.470
you're not like a totally private person.
No.

290
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:05.680
And yet you want to do what's right by your clients and Yep.

291
00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:09.430
<v 2>Exactly.
So like in snipes case,
the,
I think the odds going back to high,</v>

292
00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:13.780
the odds are he was convicted of the top felony fraud counts was eight to one.

293
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:14.650
So there was,

294
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.470
they said there was only about a 10 11% chance of him being acquitted.

295
00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:21.010
You had see,
you know,
people on CNN saying that he had no chance to win.

296
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.900
Some are still prominent legal commentary now.
Uh,
yeah,

297
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:28.950
<v 1>you always have legal common commentary,
people on CNN often,</v>

298
00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:31.620
but all the Caitlin networks who get everything wrong and they keep bringing

299
00:14:31.621 --> 00:14:32.210
them back.
It's

300
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:34.320
<v 2>like the political commentary.
What,
Oh,
for stress.</v>

301
00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.450
And these are people that are mostly never practice law.
Never tried a case,

302
00:14:37.451 --> 00:14:41.440
never dealt with a real gays and,
and it's amazing.
They'll just,
they're there,

303
00:14:41.441 --> 00:14:42.550
they have a law degree,

304
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.490
but they often don't have any legal experience and they're really there for,

305
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.780
or for political purposes.

306
00:14:46.781 --> 00:14:50.410
They know if they say the right thing that they're media bosses want them to say

307
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.720
they'll get,
even if what they're saying is complete and utter nonsense.

308
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.330
<v 1>Yeah.
So one of the things that I've been saying over the last couple of years,</v>

309
00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:59.160
and you know I'm a free speech guy,

310
00:14:59.161 --> 00:15:03.960
is that right now I'm more concerned that we're silencing ourselves.

311
00:15:03.961 --> 00:15:07.020
Then the government is coming for our speech at this very moment.

312
00:15:07.021 --> 00:15:10.710
Now of course I understand the government can always come for our speech and

313
00:15:10.711 --> 00:15:13.440
there are many ways that you're laying out right there that they can through

314
00:15:13.441 --> 00:15:15.780
going through the IRS or or whatever else.

315
00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.800
But I'm more concerned right now about sort of the mob mentality,

316
00:15:19.801 --> 00:15:23.970
the way we're weaponizing the media and social media and the rest of it.

317
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:29.310
So let's just start with the big question right now.
Social media,

318
00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:34.110
are these publishers or platforms right now,
Twitter,
Facebook,
youtube,

319
00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:35.550
and can you explain the difference between them?

320
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:36.440
<v 2>Absolutely.</v>

321
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:40.730
So all of these big tech platforms originally were able to obtain their monopoly

322
00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:42.980
status two ways.
First,

323
00:15:42.981 --> 00:15:47.930
they got Congress to pass special immunity laws a loosely called section two 30

324
00:15:47.931 --> 00:15:50.960
that particular section of the law is that applies that says,

325
00:15:50.961 --> 00:15:55.310
we're going to presume that everything you do is as a platform and not as a

326
00:15:55.311 --> 00:16:00.260
publisher.
And consequently you'll be immune from any lawsuit as a publisher,

327
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.360
as long as you are acting as a platform.

328
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.840
<v 1>So meaning that you're just the,
you're just the space so to speak.</v>

329
00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.090
People can put all kinds of crap up on there.

330
00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:12.200
You can decide what you take down or leave up,
but you're not endorsing it.

331
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.890
<v 2>Exactly.
You're just the public venue.
You're,
you're the,
the,</v>

332
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.740
the venue where they're coming to organize the Republican Party on the election

333
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.830
night,
right?
You're the restaurant,
you're the,
you're the convention centers.

334
00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:22.880
That's all you are.

335
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:27.040
And then that was even additionally privately promised by people like jacket

336
00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:30.890
Twitter who said,
I'll be the free speech wing of the free speech party.

337
00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:36.050
So he induces people to participate and deuces people to become part of Twitter

338
00:16:36.051 --> 00:16:39.350
and to give them an a competitive economic edge against their then competitors

339
00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:43.640
on the grounds that,
and hey look,
one,
the law only applies if we're a platform,

340
00:16:43.641 --> 00:16:46.280
not a publisher.
Secondly,
we are promising you,

341
00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:49.550
we will protect your free speech rights and your free speech liberties.
Now,

342
00:16:49.551 --> 00:16:53.680
it's important in that context.
Free speech means the right to uh,

343
00:16:53.690 --> 00:16:58.010
not be stopped for your speech.
The right not to be harassed for your speech,

344
00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.860
the right not to be censored for your speech.
It's both.

345
00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:03.710
That's why I was telling for a free speech is not just the right of expression.

346
00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:08.090
It means I have a rights that someone can target me because of my expression and

347
00:17:08.091 --> 00:17:12.020
use illicit mechanisms.
They can question my ideas,
they can attack my ideas.

348
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.190
If I'm a public figure,

349
00:17:13.191 --> 00:17:16.340
they have limited space in which they can talk about me as a person,

350
00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:18.440
but what they can't do is invade my privacy.

351
00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.180
What they can't do is follow me down the street.

352
00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:22.550
What they can't do is put a billboard outside my home.

353
00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:23.750
These are things they can't do.

354
00:17:23.830 --> 00:17:25.720
<v 1>So is that,
to me,</v>

355
00:17:25.721 --> 00:17:29.110
that's a really fascinating change on the way things have happened because if I

356
00:17:29.111 --> 00:17:31.810
was to look at just generally what's going on on Twitter these days,

357
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.290
if I was to walk down the street right now and somebody just everyday was

358
00:17:35.291 --> 00:17:38.020
waiting outside my house and started screaming at me and all sorts of things,

359
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.710
there is legal recourse.
I could take,
right?
I can file a,
what can I do?

360
00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:45.590
<v 2>It means that a civil suit and get an order of protection against like people.</v>

361
00:17:45.591 --> 00:17:49.160
Like I did a lot of work back in the day when I was a young lawyer for victims

362
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.250
of domestic violence and we were part of that,

363
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.970
the beginning of the orders of protection that got instituted for them,

364
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:56.760
but it's not limited to the domestic violence context.

365
00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.260
It's anybody who's stalking,

366
00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.650
anybody who's harassing anybody who's invading your privacy,

367
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:03.560
you have an equitable right and illegal,

368
00:18:03.690 --> 00:18:06.600
right to bring legal action against them and have the court say,

369
00:18:06.601 --> 00:18:09.540
I'm going to stop you from doing this and if you violate this,

370
00:18:09.541 --> 00:18:11.190
you're going to be responsible for legal fees.

371
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:12.840
You're going to be responsible for costs.

372
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:16.080
I can even put a statutory amount on there and they have to do,
they'll say,

373
00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:17.310
every time you violate this,

374
00:18:17.311 --> 00:18:21.150
it's $1,000 or five thousand ten thousand whatever's necessary to deter.

375
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.310
Those laws exist already there.

376
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.570
<v 1>So are those laws,</v>

377
00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:28.500
are there any laws related to that that exists in the digital space?
Now?
Again,

378
00:18:28.501 --> 00:18:32.160
I want to be very clean when we're doing this because,
so for example,

379
00:18:32.161 --> 00:18:35.460
all day long trolls are jumping out at me.
Go Fuck Yourself.
You know,

380
00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.440
just the word.
It's far worse than that usually.

381
00:18:37.441 --> 00:18:39.360
But like just the worst kind of things all day long.

382
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.460
Same accounts I block on my mute them.

383
00:18:41.461 --> 00:18:44.010
They just make new accounts over and over and over.
Okay.

384
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.850
It's not the worst thing in the world.
I'm still here.
I'm alive.
It's okay.
Um,

385
00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.460
but doing it in the digital realm,

386
00:18:50.461 --> 00:18:53.970
I think people would see that very differently than stocking someone just

387
00:18:53.971 --> 00:18:56.580
outside of their house or in the realm of reality.

388
00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.440
<v 2>It is only to a certain degree,
the same laws apply.</v>

389
00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:02.350
So it doesn't matter whether it's the digital world or the physical world.

390
00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.500
The same stalking laws apply.
The same harassing loan was apply.

391
00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:08.100
So somebody who stocks can be sued,
somebody who stocks,

392
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:11.110
they can even be charged with crimes under particular cases so they can be

393
00:19:11.111 --> 00:19:12.580
referred for criminal prosecution.

394
00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.760
That's happened to people that have done that too.
Mike Cernovich for example.

395
00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:18.490
So the,
uh,
so you can use civil remedies,

396
00:19:18.491 --> 00:19:21.280
you can request criminal remedies with criminal referrals,

397
00:19:21.430 --> 00:19:22.750
you can bring equitable actions,

398
00:19:22.751 --> 00:19:25.750
you can bring legal actions and of courts are actually very sensitive to it,

399
00:19:25.751 --> 00:19:29.310
particularly like in California where because of the problem of Stalker Razzi

400
00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:32.800
they expanded the do the kind of protection either in the digital space or the

401
00:19:32.801 --> 00:19:33.634
personal space.

402
00:19:33.850 --> 00:19:36.940
And the u s supreme court is increasingly recognized that these days those

403
00:19:36.941 --> 00:19:38.110
spaces are indistinguishable.

404
00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.400
<v 1>So it's interesting to me because as part of the,
let's say,</v>

405
00:19:41.401 --> 00:19:45.690
the free speech crew online right now I'm very hesitant of a lot of this stuff

406
00:19:45.691 --> 00:19:48.960
because it's like I want everyone to be able to express themselves.

407
00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:54.170
And yet I understand we need certain super specific laws,

408
00:19:54.901 --> 00:19:57.150
libel laws,
slander laws,
harassment laws.

409
00:19:57.450 --> 00:20:01.290
And yet there's a certain irony where it's like the free speech crew are the

410
00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:04.050
ones that are going to have to defend those laws is like,

411
00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.630
it's like a really weird place for people like us to be in it.
Yeah,

412
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:09.440
<v 2>I agree.
The way I think of it as I see it as an unequal equation.</v>

413
00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.920
So what's happening is you're seeing big media,
big powerful forces,

414
00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.450
people with big platforms be able to defame little people that will be able to

415
00:20:17.451 --> 00:20:21.240
run smear campaigns against people.
It will be able to attack and,

416
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:26.320
and encourage stalking and harassment and online mobs at will and not be held

417
00:20:26.421 --> 00:20:29.720
responsible.
And it's the little guy that's still fighting for their free speech.

418
00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:30.710
And yet they're the ones,

419
00:20:30.711 --> 00:20:34.310
the little guy who's getting sued by big institutional actors are backed by big

420
00:20:34.311 --> 00:20:36.980
institutional players and they're being sued for defamation.

421
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:40.610
They're being sued for liable,
they're being sued for there being the platform.

422
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:44.150
And so we need to do is equalize that playing field because the first amendment

423
00:20:44.151 --> 00:20:46.100
is also about protecting everybody speech.

424
00:20:46.101 --> 00:20:49.030
And that means the little guy can't get harassed in ways the big guys immune

425
00:20:49.031 --> 00:20:52.660
from and the big guy can't use powers that the little guy doesn't have access
to.

426
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.240
So it needs to be equalized out.
So true.

427
00:20:55.241 --> 00:20:59.290
Free speech means people who are important in the independent press and the

428
00:20:59.291 --> 00:21:02.470
freedom of press of the independent press,
not be harassed,
not be,

429
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:04.660
not the legal system,
not be used against them,

430
00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:08.950
disproportionately indiscriminately not have the d platforming happening against

431
00:21:08.951 --> 00:21:12.340
them disproportionately indiscriminately.
And that's what's taking place.

432
00:21:12.341 --> 00:21:13.450
And that's what needs to equalize.

433
00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:17.140
So true free speech means we need to have some equality of treatment between

434
00:21:17.141 --> 00:21:17.530
everybody.

435
00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:21.780
<v 1>Okay,
so now backing that to the platform,
verse publisher a part of this.
So they,</v>

436
00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:22.890
they help get these law.

437
00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:26.690
What statute did you say to section two third section two 30 okay.
So they,

438
00:21:26.691 --> 00:21:30.880
they help get these laws passed.
Now they're treated as platforms,

439
00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:34.800
but it seems that they're acting often more as

440
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.870
<v 2>publishers,
right?
They now admit that.</v>

441
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:38.730
So in other suits that I brought against Twitter,

442
00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:42.750
they said that they are a publisher and they want all of the protections.

443
00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:43.613
As a publisher,

444
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.340
they went all the legal privileges of a publisher because the publisher has a

445
00:21:47.341 --> 00:21:48.990
wide range of special protections,

446
00:21:48.991 --> 00:21:51.720
particularly events has any institutional former backing.

447
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:55.020
So there are certain libel laws that apply to individuals differently than they

448
00:21:55.021 --> 00:21:58.140
apply to corporations.
The same is true of big media publishers,

449
00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:02.520
so they're now saying to courts,
so in the Prager suit against youtube,

450
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.730
youtube in Google's defense is we're acting as a sensor,

451
00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:06.930
we're acting as an editor,

452
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:10.710
we're acting as a publisher and look at all these privileges we have as as as a

453
00:22:10.711 --> 00:22:12.360
publisher,
which a lot of people,

454
00:22:12.361 --> 00:22:15.420
and it was one of the issues we raised was if they're acting as a publisher,

455
00:22:15.421 --> 00:22:17.430
they shouldn't have the immunities of a platform.

456
00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.780
Unfortunately the courts have interpreted what congress said to them in a

457
00:22:21.781 --> 00:22:24.360
political way,
and this is often the case with a lot of law,

458
00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:27.510
a lot of laws that interpreted through a political framework and how they

459
00:22:27.511 --> 00:22:28.860
interpreted it as,
oh,

460
00:22:28.861 --> 00:22:32.370
the Co is congress doesn't want us to allow big tech to be sued.

461
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.300
So we're going to give them all the protections as a publisher and all the

462
00:22:36.301 --> 00:22:40.470
section two 30 immunities as a platform.
So they have a degree of protection.

463
00:22:40.471 --> 00:22:41.970
As senator Holly described it,

464
00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:45.930
a degree of immunity and benefits that no publisher in the world has,

465
00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.350
that Congress is the one that actually gave it to them as the courts have

466
00:22:49.351 --> 00:22:52.020
construed it though somewhat argue.
That's beyond what Congress intended.

467
00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:57.020
<v 1>Right,
so Prager lost the initial lawsuit.
Correct.
Are they,
and I know Dennis,</v>

468
00:22:57.021 --> 00:22:59.900
but I actually don't know the answer.
Are they pursuing other illegal measures?

469
00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:02.010
<v 2>You're still trying to go through the appellate process,</v>

470
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.370
but they're unlikely to prevail under the current environment because the

471
00:23:05.371 --> 00:23:08.670
current environment is such that like the,
when I pursued Twitter,

472
00:23:08.671 --> 00:23:11.940
I brought unique novel theories.
I brought breach of contract theories,

473
00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:15.360
a consumer protection act theories,
because my equitable theories,

474
00:23:15.361 --> 00:23:18.900
because my view was Twitter had lied to people to induce their participation,

475
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.390
profited from that participation sold.

476
00:23:21.391 --> 00:23:25.410
That person's like someone like Charles Johnson would come in and 30,000 other

477
00:23:25.411 --> 00:23:27.720
people joined Twitter to follow Charles Johnson.

478
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.730
They now have all of their private information.

479
00:23:29.731 --> 00:23:33.570
They get to aggregate that information and then marketize it and monetize it and

480
00:23:33.571 --> 00:23:37.110
then they get to censor in band Charles Johnson forever from Twitter because

481
00:23:37.111 --> 00:23:39.060
they don't like one tweety mate.
Well,

482
00:23:39.061 --> 00:23:41.250
if my view is that's really a breach of contract,

483
00:23:41.251 --> 00:23:45.350
that's really a breach of equitable duties and obligations,
but the court saw,
oh,

484
00:23:45.351 --> 00:23:48.290
Congress is saying section two 30 means I'm not supposed to allow Twitter to

485
00:23:48.291 --> 00:23:49.550
ever be sued for anything.

486
00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.210
That's what's happened and that's why Congress needs to fix that side of the

487
00:23:53.211 --> 00:23:56.810
equation because unfortunately the courts haven't stepped up to do it
themselves.

488
00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:01.250
<v 1>Do you think there is an interesting piece of this that is just because of</v>

489
00:24:01.251 --> 00:24:05.750
anonymous accounts and I don't know what the legal protections or non

490
00:24:05.751 --> 00:24:06.980
protections would be around that,

491
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:10.330
but if you generally look at what's happening online,
if you,

492
00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.400
if we removed anonymous accounts and by the way,
as a free speech guy,

493
00:24:13.401 --> 00:24:16.760
I'm not for that because I now understand the off many times,
many times.

494
00:24:16.761 --> 00:24:19.430
I mean I see this with people that I meet at live events.

495
00:24:19.431 --> 00:24:20.970
They'll come up to me after and they say,
you know,

496
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:23.090
I have an anonymous account because I'm a conservative and I don't,
you know,

497
00:24:23.091 --> 00:24:24.770
so it's not that they're trolls,

498
00:24:24.771 --> 00:24:28.250
it's not that their flame flaming people or whatever else it is.

499
00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:30.920
But there's a piece of me that thinks,
man,

500
00:24:30.921 --> 00:24:34.280
if you just removed anonymous accounts and put,

501
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:36.920
put aside the decent human part of it for a second,
sure.

502
00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:42.120
That actually 80 to 90% of all of this nonsense would disappear because you've

503
00:24:42.441 --> 00:24:46.550
got brave keyboard warriors with no skin in the game that are trying to so
havoc.

504
00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.040
I don't know if there's a legal piece of this somewhere.

505
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:50.040
<v 2>There is a legal way to do it.</v>

506
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:53.640
So if you're an operating on an anonymous account and you're doing something

507
00:24:53.641 --> 00:24:57.630
that's not protected by the first amendment,
like stocking,
like harassing,
like,

508
00:24:57.631 --> 00:24:59.190
uh,
like invading someone's privacy,

509
00:24:59.191 --> 00:25:02.280
which is a broad tort that covers a wide range of remedies,

510
00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:04.470
including like in the Covington pay case,

511
00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:08.910
we'll bring the first case that establishes that doxing is in fact an invasion

512
00:25:08.911 --> 00:25:13.580
of privacy.
So,
uh,
you can sue,
you can require that Twitter or Google,

513
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:18.160
whoever did it,
Facebook identify that individual,
uh,
and,

514
00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:21.450
and consequently that individual can be held legally liable for their course of

515
00:25:21.451 --> 00:25:23.520
conduct.
So people who think they can hide,

516
00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:25.920
they can do bad things behind anonymity or wrong,

517
00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:27.730
they can do good things behind it and enmity.

518
00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:31.440
And the First Amendment and compas is that in an entity is often critical to all

519
00:25:31.441 --> 00:25:32.430
kinds of free speech.

520
00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.520
But if what you're doing is always been outside the scope of the first amendment

521
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.440
like stalking,
like harassing,

522
00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.040
like intending to censor and chain people based on lies and libels,

523
00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:44.820
you can be held individually liable and you're an anonymity of your account will

524
00:25:44.821 --> 00:25:46.740
not protect you from legal responsibility.

525
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:50.540
<v 1>It's so interesting because I'm hearing you on all this and then there is this</v>

526
00:25:50.541 --> 00:25:51.150
other,
this,

527
00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:55.910
there's the absolute as part of me on speech that even though I know we need

528
00:25:55.911 --> 00:25:57.350
these protections more than ever,

529
00:25:57.351 --> 00:25:59.310
there's just this little piece of me that's like,
ah,

530
00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.760
I don't want everything to get caught up in legal ease.
And that,

531
00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:05.570
and I guess that ultimately is the balance that guys like you have to deal with

532
00:26:05.571 --> 00:26:06.060
every day.
Yeah,

533
00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:06.580
<v 2>absolutely.</v>

534
00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:10.980
It was the pitch that we made to senator Holly was don't treat these as

535
00:26:10.981 --> 00:26:12.510
utilities and start to regulate them.

536
00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:15.780
I understand why people are calling for that because what they're seeing is

537
00:26:15.781 --> 00:26:18.990
monopoly power.
The interesting thing is in the first amendment,

538
00:26:18.991 --> 00:26:21.420
including in California,
uh,
and to,

539
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:24.420
it used to be the law and it still is the law in some places,

540
00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:28.620
which is if you have the effect of a corporate monopoly on the public square,

541
00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.740
you are then considered a state actor for first amendment purposes.

542
00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:35.670
This was established way back because you had company towns who are like,
well,

543
00:26:35.671 --> 00:26:38.430
how do we suppress this union movement?
Well,

544
00:26:38.431 --> 00:26:39.780
why don't we just own the whole town?

545
00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.180
We only share if we own the copy on the public square.

546
00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:45.810
Now band petitioning now we'll ban circulating.
Now will they had organized.

547
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.380
So by that definition,

548
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:50.520
you would argue the social media companies are absolutely okay.

549
00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.800
It's called the [inaudible] doctrine here in the state of California,

550
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.070
which applies to private malls.

551
00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.990
Private moles can't ban you from circulating certain things in the public spaces

552
00:26:57.991 --> 00:26:59.550
of those private malls.
Well,

553
00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.990
is there any more monopolized public square than big tech media than Twitter,

554
00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.500
than Facebook then youtube than Google.
They own,

555
00:27:07.501 --> 00:27:12.210
they own 85 to 95% of the public square and all corporations are creations of

556
00:27:12.211 --> 00:27:15.000
the state and they get certain protections for that because they have a

557
00:27:15.001 --> 00:27:15.834
corporate charter.

558
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:19.200
They're given certain immunities from individual liability for participating in

559
00:27:19.201 --> 00:27:21.270
that company.
Well,
in exchange for that,

560
00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:24.390
once they get to the place where they monopolize the public square,

561
00:27:24.391 --> 00:27:27.180
those two things exist,
both of monopoly and the public square,

562
00:27:27.181 --> 00:27:32.040
which is usually over 75 80% control of a market space.
When they have that,

563
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:33.300
and when it's the public square,

564
00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:36.090
I think they should be held to the same first amendment standards as everyone

565
00:27:36.091 --> 00:27:39.330
else because otherwise we create this huge loophole in the first amendment to

566
00:27:39.331 --> 00:27:43.590
privatized control of the public square.
So,
uh,
Eric Weinstein,

567
00:27:43.591 --> 00:27:44.940
who I'm guessing you're familiar with,

568
00:27:44.941 --> 00:27:47.910
I had a couple of discussions with him about this and one of the ideas that he's

569
00:27:47.911 --> 00:27:52.100
put forward,
and my libertarian side doesn't really like this,
but,

570
00:27:52.101 --> 00:27:54.930
but I see some value in it is that because we don't,

571
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.070
we don't have public spaces online,
so it makes everything,
so in effect,

572
00:27:59.071 --> 00:28:00.630
everything's private.
There's nothing public.

573
00:28:00.631 --> 00:28:02.100
So the government has nothing to do with anything.

574
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:06.600
But maybe this would be an actual good use of the government if there were

575
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.500
platforms that were government platforms that the only rule basically was,

576
00:28:10.501 --> 00:28:13.590
you can't break the laws of the United States so that people could get their

577
00:28:13.591 --> 00:28:16.410
information out there,
but you,
but if you break the laws of the United States,

578
00:28:16.411 --> 00:28:17.190
you're in trouble.

579
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:21.030
Then the private companies could do whatever the hell they wanted and we'd have

580
00:28:21.031 --> 00:28:24.720
no reason to.
We'd have no ability to stop them.
But in effect,

581
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:29.400
because everything is private,
there's nothing public anymore.
Right,
exactly.

582
00:28:29.401 --> 00:28:32.250
And so my view is that once you become a monopoly,

583
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.850
and particularly when you become a monopoly based on federal congressional

584
00:28:35.851 --> 00:28:40.350
immunity,
then you have different obligations than any other private actor.

585
00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.920
So that's one argument.
One argument is if you become,
if you become a month,

586
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:47.700
if you choose to have a monopoly in the,
in the public square space,

587
00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:50.460
you're going to have the same first amendment rules as any government actor.

588
00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:51.443
That's one option.

589
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:55.440
Another option is just to condition their continued immunity on First Amendment

590
00:28:55.441 --> 00:28:57.930
inclusion.
Those are the arguments that I made to the Twitter lawyers.

591
00:28:57.931 --> 00:29:01.440
In the Johnson case.
It was like,
look,
you guys don't have to reinvent the wheel.

592
00:29:01.650 --> 00:29:04.320
Like well they said they were worried about stalking and harassing and I was

593
00:29:04.321 --> 00:29:07.560
like very simple.
Just take all the first amendment rules that already exist,

594
00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.890
incorporate them within your terms of service and then you'll,

595
00:29:10.891 --> 00:29:14.910
you'll eliminate 90% of your concerns and questions and you won't have to deal

596
00:29:14.911 --> 00:29:17.280
with a lot of the nonsense,
right?
Like right now,

597
00:29:17.281 --> 00:29:19.980
there rules would be considered void for vagueness if they were staying in

598
00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:23.790
because you have rules that are subject to individual women discretion and

599
00:29:23.791 --> 00:29:25.620
they're intentionally written that way.
Right.
So let me,

600
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:30.660
did you catch a any of uh,
Tim Pool and uh,
uh,
Joe Rogan with Jack?

601
00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:34.380
Exactly.
Yeah.
And he detailed this instance after instance after instance.

602
00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:38.310
I mean the way they decided to Ddi Platform,
Alex Jones was highly subjective,

603
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:42.820
very interpretive.
And I've seen far worse,
I mean,
for example,
the Covington case,

604
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.100
you had a prominent Hollywood figure show,

605
00:29:45.101 --> 00:29:47.860
an image of saying the saying the Covington kids should have to go through a

606
00:29:47.861 --> 00:29:49.390
shredder and be killed.

607
00:29:49.570 --> 00:29:52.240
You had raise as long calling from the be punched in the face.

608
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:55.430
Nothing was done about that.
And yet,
uh,

609
00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.600
Alex Jones posts something that's just a funny video and they're like,

610
00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.270
oh my goodness,
we have to get rid of Alex Jones.

611
00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.480
<v 1>Okay.
So I want to spend a whole bunch of time on cutting team.</v>

612
00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:07.110
Cause I think actually that was the moment that this shifted and maybe at a

613
00:30:07.111 --> 00:30:09.450
legal sense it crystallized in my mind a little bit more.

614
00:30:09.451 --> 00:30:10.680
That's actually when I reached out to you,

615
00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:13.830
cause I saw you just going for going for it.
And I thought,
okay,

616
00:30:13.831 --> 00:30:15.330
this is a conversation you have to have,
but let's,

617
00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.730
let's talk about Jones for a minute.
So Jones,
so you've,

618
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.360
you've done some defense work with Jones and then presenting Alex Jones and info

619
00:30:21.361 --> 00:30:24.180
wars and now his outside general counsel on all these legal matters.

620
00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:27.420
So you represent him across the board on all of these things.

621
00:30:27.421 --> 00:30:31.570
So I guess my first question is what's it like when Alex Jones,
you know,

622
00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:33.360
knocks on your door or calls you up?

623
00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:36.670
<v 2>Know he's a very animated guy,
very nice guy,
very open,
very sincere.</v>

624
00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:38.380
When was fascinating from the get go,

625
00:30:38.381 --> 00:30:42.370
he was saying 90% of what they're saying about me,
it doesn't isn't the case.

626
00:30:42.371 --> 00:30:45.790
He's like,
I would defend us on for on free speech and free press grounds anyway.

627
00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.710
But what they're actually saying,
I said,

628
00:30:47.711 --> 00:30:51.130
I didn't say I never attack these families.
I never went after these family.

629
00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.200
Never told people to go to the families' homes.
None of that.

630
00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:55.720
<v 1>Yeah.
So this is,
that stuff specifically is about the sandy,</v>

631
00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.290
<v 2>exactly.
Sandy Hook case.
And so that they're either,</v>

632
00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:01.710
they took a media matters video and assume that's what I said and it wasn't

633
00:31:01.711 --> 00:31:02.250
really,

634
00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:05.550
they took most of that out of context and didn't put in that I had corrected the

635
00:31:05.551 --> 00:31:09.540
record long time ago.
Um,
and so part of it was very nice guy,

636
00:31:09.541 --> 00:31:13.290
actually very friendly guy,
very accessible guy.
Even more so than snipes.

637
00:31:13.291 --> 00:31:16.260
He gets mobbed when he goes out in public with people hunting selfies and that

638
00:31:16.261 --> 00:31:17.580
sort of thing.
Um,

639
00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:21.540
and he doesn't act like the Jaguar did with a lady very nice and sociable and

640
00:31:21.541 --> 00:31:24.030
friendly.
Um,
so the uh,
runs it,
you know,

641
00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:28.740
nice small business enterprise access TV to talk radio to Internet and he's

642
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.800
intended to be the poster boy of their d platforming campaigns.
They,
they,

643
00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:35.700
when I told the press is this case really isn't about Alex Jones.

644
00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:38.850
It's about the ability of the independent press to operate.
Uh,

645
00:31:38.851 --> 00:31:42.060
we'll law fair be discriminately or desparately used against ordinary

646
00:31:42.061 --> 00:31:45.690
individuals in the same way that d platforming is happening already in the big

647
00:31:45.691 --> 00:31:49.530
tech space.
And so are we going to protect the little guy or not?
And Alex Jones,

648
00:31:49.531 --> 00:31:50.790
they figured would be the convenience.

649
00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:52.650
They would sort of create a parody of them,

650
00:31:52.651 --> 00:31:55.950
a caricature of them that they could get the public to believe,
make them,

651
00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:59.000
make the audience feel bad if they watch him.
The uh,

652
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:01.350
may feel guilty to be associated or attached with them.

653
00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.650
And as soon as my representation was announced and another lawyer,

654
00:32:04.651 --> 00:32:07.560
norm Pattis big old school civil rights lawyer in Connecticut,

655
00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:09.870
I think he still has a pony tail.
I mean,
he's old school.

656
00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:13.140
He had friends and family members that are connected to what happened at Sandy

657
00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.410
Hook.
So he,
uh,
immediately,
you know,
wanted to be involved in the case.

658
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:18.810
As soon as he was Huffington post writes a hit piece on,

659
00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:21.990
they don't talk about a civil rights legacy.
They don't talk about any of that.

660
00:32:21.991 --> 00:32:24.420
Its entirety.
The whole thing is intended to smear them.

661
00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:28.140
And it's sending a message that if you're a lawyer and you dare to fend Alex

662
00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:30.780
Jones,
we're going to try to destroy your reputation in the public space.

663
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.810
And that's exactly the problem that needs to be fixed and remedied.

664
00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:36.940
<v 1>Yeah.
So related to Jones specifically,</v>

665
00:32:36.941 --> 00:32:39.680
I mean one of the things that I thought was was most incredible,

666
00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:43.910
I forget the exact order of it,
but basically within 48 hours,
all the platforms,

667
00:32:43.911 --> 00:32:46.670
so came down.
Yes.
And it's like,
okay,
is that,

668
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:50.390
is that that you guys truly your calling each other and coordinating it or is it

669
00:32:50.391 --> 00:32:52.160
that you're all sort of cowards,

670
00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:56.570
you somebody breaks the ice and now you're just followers and I don't know that

671
00:32:56.571 --> 00:32:58.880
it matters either way.
Right?
It probably doesn't matter either way,

672
00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:02.690
but what I thought was okay,
it doesn't even matter what he has said.

673
00:33:02.691 --> 00:33:05.200
Short of breaking in American law,
in my opinion,

674
00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:10.490
the real issue here is that if he can't be on there,

675
00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:15.230
then why is fire can on there?
I'm not even,
I'm not making a comp comparison.

676
00:33:15.231 --> 00:33:17.060
Direct comparison to them.
Why is Hamas on there?

677
00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:19.190
We could do a zillion other things.
You know,

678
00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.160
<v 2>it is fair.
It is obvious and evident.</v>

679
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:24.140
There are people who have said far worse things that just happened to have a

680
00:33:24.141 --> 00:33:26.330
different ideological or intellectual perspective.

681
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:30.230
Even if you took all the accusations against them at face value in 90% of them

682
00:33:30.231 --> 00:33:33.380
are not true.
The what and that's your typical smear campaign.

683
00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.980
The conservative or the person on the right or the person on the independent

684
00:33:36.981 --> 00:33:39.770
anti war left will often be attacked and smeared.

685
00:33:39.771 --> 00:33:43.040
90% of what's said about them is not true,
but even if it was true,

686
00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:46.570
what the other side has said is usually far worse and far more great.
Jackson,

687
00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:50.120
far more accessible and it's the obvious disparate treatment they're using
their,

688
00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:53.120
they're concentrated power to,
uh,

689
00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:57.890
any including their law fair power to effectively wipe out the little guy so

690
00:33:57.891 --> 00:34:00.080
that only the big guys voice is heard and all.

691
00:34:00.081 --> 00:34:02.780
To me it's about the audience because that Jones is still gonna talk.

692
00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:04.130
It's just candy audience here.

693
00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:07.580
So it's about their right to choose their right to choose what news they want to

694
00:34:07.581 --> 00:34:11.130
look at,
what views they want to have,
what,
how they filter information.

695
00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:11.990
I always say like,

696
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:14.960
like I don't represent people that are accused of racism or the rest people that

697
00:34:14.961 --> 00:34:16.670
are actual racist.
Not everybody these days,

698
00:34:16.671 --> 00:34:19.410
everybody's right were being accused and being an actual races are greater,

699
00:34:19.411 --> 00:34:20.940
but the people who are really involved in something,

700
00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:24.530
I generally avoid representation of them.
Um,
the uh,

701
00:34:24.531 --> 00:34:27.380
because I just don't want to be affiliated it just because that is an old

702
00:34:27.381 --> 00:34:30.680
personal issue.
But if you look at what those people,
I've always said,

703
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:31.880
let those people debate.

704
00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:35.690
Because if you watch Richard Spencer debate somebody else,
99% of the time,

705
00:34:35.691 --> 00:34:39.650
the Nice,
calm,
reasonable person is not going to say Richard Spencer is right.

706
00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:44.660
So always expose ideas to more ideas,
more sunshine because let the ideas get,

707
00:34:44.661 --> 00:34:48.020
let trust the audience.
That's really what they're all saying.

708
00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:51.230
The all we're big tech is doing what these big lawsuits are doing against little

709
00:34:51.231 --> 00:34:55.460
guys is intended to say we don't trust the audience to make up their own mind.

710
00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:57.830
We don't trust the audience to make up their own decisions.

711
00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:59.540
We have to control what you think.

712
00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:02.390
We have to control what you do because you might choose something that we don't

713
00:35:02.391 --> 00:35:05.360
want you to do if you actually have freedom of choice,
freedom of thought,

714
00:35:05.361 --> 00:35:06.170
freedom of expression.
