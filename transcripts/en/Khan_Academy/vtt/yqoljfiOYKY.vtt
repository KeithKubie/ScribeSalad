00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.250
- [Instructor] My three
favorite cities to visit

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.180
are Kyoto, Japan; Barcelona,
Spain; and Sydney, Australia.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.750
So, the way it's written right over here

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.410
is very strange because
we're talking about

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.700
our three favorite cities,

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.750
but they're listing,

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.440
when they just separated
everything out here with a comma

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.840
it makes Japan look
like one of the cities.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.250
And we know that Japan isn't a city.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.540
And it makes Spain look
like one of the cities.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.500
It just lists Kyoto, Japan;

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.820
Barcelona, Spain,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.930
but we know that Japan
is just give telling us

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.450
what country Kyoto is in

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.810
and Spain is just telling us
what country Barcelona is.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.030
And so what we really wanna do

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.060
is we wanna separate Kyoto, Japan

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.860
from Barcelona, Spain

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.620
from Sydney, Australia.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.230
And so typically when you list things

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.200
you would use a comma,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.970
except when the things you're listing

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.320
have commas in them.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.510
Then you would wanna use semicolons.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.160
So we definitely wanna change this

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.430
and ideally, ideally we would put.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.380
Ideally we would put semicolons.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.880
Semicolon here

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.920
and then another semicolon
right over there.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.280
Now let's see which choices do that.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.210
So we have, and actually this last,

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.890
we already had a semicolon
right over there.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.660
So really just turn this
comma into a semicolon.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.520
So Kyoto, Japan semicolon
Barcelona, Spain semicolon

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.350
and Sydney, Australia.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.420
Yep, that looks great.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.450
This one has the same issue.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.680
Kyoto, Japan

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.990
Barcelona, Spain

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.590
and then they got rid of that semicolon

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.540
and they put another comma.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.560
So this one is strange.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.755
Once again it looks like it's listing

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.200
more than three cities

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.250
or it's counting Japan and Spain as cities

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.800
and then it says Kyoto, Japan semicolon.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.290
Barcelona, Spain.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.550
But then they put the comma.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.190
But here, once we start
listing things with semicolons

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.370
we just keep listing
things with semicolons.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.663
So this one is not right as well.
