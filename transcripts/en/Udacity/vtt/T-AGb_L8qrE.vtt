00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now, let's do the experiment again, instead of just standing on the scale,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
you're standing on the scale and the ground, so your weight is distributed between the two.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
If I'm going to draw this force diagram and once again I'm going to represent you as a box,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
gravity is still pulling you down, that's your weight but now there's two points of contact.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
There's the normal force from the scale which I'll abbreviate FNS for scale

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and is the normal force from the ground, FNG.

00:00:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now, I want to know how big is FNS, bigger than, equal to, or less than mg. Choose your answer.
