Narrator: IN 1998,

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:08.508 line:0%
A YOUNG SCIENTIST
NAMED SAUL PERLMUTTER

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:11.744 line:0%
WAS THINKING
SOME VERY BIG THOUGHTS, INDEED.

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:16.116 line:0%
Perlmutter: THE QUESTION
THAT'S BEEN REALLY EXCITING ME

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:19.352 line:0%
IS WHETHER THE UNIVERSE
WILL LAST FOREVER.

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:21.854 line:0%
DO WE LIVE IN A UNIVERSE
THAT IS INFINITE,

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:23.757
OR IT WILL SOMEDAY
COME TO AN END?

00:00:25.391 --> 00:00:28.761
THE TWO BIG OPTIONS AT THAT TIME
WERE THAT THE UNIVERSE

00:00:28.761 --> 00:00:31.097
COULD EXPAND FOREVER,

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:34.767
BUT JUST SLOW AND SLOW AND SLOW,
BUT FOREVER BE EXPANDING,

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:37.236
OR, IF THERE WAS ENOUGH STUFF
IN THE UNIVERSE

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:38.337
TO GRAVITATIONALLY ATTRACT IT,

00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:39.538
IT COULD SLOW TO A HALT

00:00:39.538 --> 00:00:41.141
AND THEN COLLAPSE
AND COME TO AN END.

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:44.477
Narrator:
PERLMUTTER WAS MEASURING

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:46.545
THE WAY THE UNIVERSE
WAS EXPANDING

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:51.117
BY OBSERVING EXPLODING STARS
CALLED SUPERNOVAE.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:57.690
ONE PARTICULAR KIND OF SUPERNOVA
ALWAYS EXPLODES THE SAME WAY

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.193
BECAUSE IT WAITS UNTIL
JUST A CRITICAL AMOUNT OF MASS

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:02.295
HAS FALLEN ON IT,
AND THEN IT EXPLODES.

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:05.131
SO, THEY ALL LOOK VERY SIMILAR
TO EACH OTHER.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.967
THEY BRIGHTEN AS A FIREWORK,
THEN FADE AWAY,

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:10.069
AND THEY REACH
THE SAME BRIGHTNESS.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:13.072
AND YOU CAN THEN USE THAT AS AN
INDICATOR OF HOW FAR AWAY IT IS

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:15.908
BY JUST LOOKING TO SEE
HOW BRIGHT IT APPEARS TO YOU.

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:18.377
Narrator: EVENTUALLY,
AFTER THE TEAM HAD IDENTIFIED

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:20.847
42 SUCH DYING STARS,

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:24.050
THE CALCULATIONS BEGAN.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.720
WHAT PERLMUTTER DISCOVERED
SHOCKED HIM.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.990
THE DATA WAS TELLING
THE WRONG STORY.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.926
THE UNIVERSE DIDN'T APPEAR
TO BE SLOWING DOWN.

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:36.863
WE THOUGHT THAT
THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD SEE,

00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:39.698
AND IT LOOKED LIKE
THE OPPOSITE WAS TAKING PLACE,

00:01:39.698 --> 00:01:43.369
THAT, IN FACT, THE UNIVERSE WAS
SPEEDING UP IN ITS EXPANSION.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.738
THESE DISTANT SUPERNOVA
WERE FAINTER

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:50.076
THAN YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT,
AND VERY SIGNIFICANTLY FAINTER.

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:54.413
THEY WERE, YOU KNOW,
PROBABLY 20% OR MORE,

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:56.783
AND THAT'S THE HALLMARK
OF A UNIVERSE

00:01:56.783 --> 00:01:59.285
THAT'S ACTUALLY SPEEDING UP
IN ITS EXPANSION.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:03.055
Narrator: ON THE ONE HAND,
THIS WAS A GOOD RESULT.

00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:06.092
IT WAS NEW SCIENCE
AND PRODUCED A NOBEL PRIZE

00:02:06.092 --> 00:02:08.661
FOR SAUL PERLMUTTER.

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:13.932
ON THE OTHER,
IT RAISED AN OBVIOUS QUESTION.

00:02:13.932 --> 00:02:17.570
ONCE YOU KNOW THAT THE UNIVERSE
IS ACTUALLY SPEEDING UP,

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:19.505
THEN YOU'RE FACED
WITH THE QUESTION OF,

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:21.774
"WELL, WHAT COULD MAKE IT
SPEED UP?"

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:27.279
Narrator: SO FAR, THE ONLY
REAL PROGRESS ON THAT QUESTION

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:30.249
HAS BEEN TO GIVE THE PHENOMENON
A NAME.

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:34.153
IT'S BECOME KNOWN AS
DARK ENERGY.

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:38.757
DARK ENERGY IS JUST THE TERM WE
USE TO DESCRIBE WHATEVER IT IS

00:02:38.757 --> 00:02:41.394
THAT MAKES THE UNIVERSE
ACCELERATE IN ITS EXPANSION.

00:02:41.394 --> 00:02:44.597
WHAT MAKES IT EXPAND
FASTER AND FASTER?

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:47.166
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS.
IT'S A MYSTERY.

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:49.802
AND, SO, WE CALL IT "DARK"
TO REFLECT OUR IGNORANCE,

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:51.938
NOT BECAUSE THE COLOR IS DARK.
