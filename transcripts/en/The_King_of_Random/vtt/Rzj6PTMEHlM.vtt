00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hey what's up guys welcome back

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.100
Now today I thought it would be fun to play with some "off the shelf" kitchen chemistry

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.500
To prepare for this experiment today I went down to the local supercenter and picked up two main ingredients

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.200
A bag of white sugar, and a bottle of drain opener like this.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.100
Now when you get to the drain cleaner aisle

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.300
There is going to be two main types of drain cleaners

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.600
There is sodium hydroxide and sulfuric acid. This one here is sulfuric acid

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.100
sodium hydroxide is really a cool stuff

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.100
And you can tell that because they usually put it in another bag for additional protection

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.200
This is extremely nasty stuff and it can do a lot of damage

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.620
and you definitely don't want to get it on your skin

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.160
so it's important to use the right kind of protection

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.500
Now this stuff is labeled drain opener but all it really is

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.640
is about 96% concentrated sulfuric acid

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.640
and if we open up the bottle and pour it out you can see

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.680
its a very clear liquid very similar to the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.700
sulfuric acid we extracted from my car battery.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.120
That's essentially all this is, virgin sulfuric acid, with buffer.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:47.760
Whatever buffer means.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.580
If we dip something like a piece of PH paper in the liquid

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.000
you can see it actually tops out on the acidity scale.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.500
Pretty dangerous stuff.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.500
So we got our bottle of drain open, and we've

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.489
white sugar now what do you think is
going to happen if we mix the two

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.000
together so step one I'm just taking a
normal drinking glass I'm gonna fill

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.510
this up about halfway with white sugar
and then step two we're gonna take our

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.720
drain cleaner pour it into the glass
until the liquid level rises just above

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.659
the sugar then we're going to stir that
up thoroughly with something like a fork

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.580
and then we're just going to watch and
see what it does looks kind of nice huh

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.290
what's going to delicious right now take
it on a nice golden color it's pretty

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.140
sweet
look at that it's kind of goopy kind of

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.880
slushy it looks like a coke frosty see
it changing color getting kind of syrupy

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.180
it's actually starting to warm up so at
this point it's a good idea to insert

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.120
back in the way
ok so it's been about 30 seconds since

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.560
we stirred this sulfuric acid in you can
see the liquids turning black nothing

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.760
else much seems to be happening though
just kind of hanging out if I were to

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.950
feel this I can feel the glass warming
up it's turning into like a black syrup

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:02.680
oh and it's starting to grow this right
here is where the magic happens watch

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.500
this

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.280
this little black pillar starts rising
out of the glass you see the smoke and

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.980
the steam coming off there that is
vapours of sulfur dioxide and steam if

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.530
you were to try this reaction indoors
the sulfur dioxide would actually

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.980
irritate your eyes making them water
like crazy and if it gets into your nose

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.430
if you breathe it in it can actually
make your nostrils swell making it very

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.870
difficult to breathe ask me how I know
that even being outdoors you can see the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.340
fumes are irritating my eyes as we speak
now you can see the reaction stopped and

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.069
we've actually let it cool down for
about five minutes so we can touch the

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.209
glass this is an exothermic reaction it
produces a lot of heat so now that it's

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.760
had a chance to cool off a bit let's go
ahead and pick up the glass and take a

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.680
closer look ooh that is extremely hot that
is super super hot I have to keep moving

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.709
this thing or it's going to burn my hand
and this is after five minutes I'm

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.100
actually surprised the glass didn't
crack and look what we've got coming out

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.180
of here guys we've got a big black
charred column of carbon you see how it

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.620
arched over and then solidified look at
this stuff closely it's very unique and

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.010
very interesting it almost looks like
lava rock that's spewed on a volcano and

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.910
cooled down in the ocean but it's
definitely not that hard see if we can

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.950
pull it out the glass here yeah look at
that

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.610
so looking down the glass you can see
actually all of the sugar burned up

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.209
everything's completely reacted there's
no more sulfuric acid no more sugar

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.390
everything is completely gone we've got
all captured here in this dark and

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.130
demonic looking black candy cane that's
fantastic now this stuff is pretty firm

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.579
I'm surprised is holding up as well as
it is but it's still very brittle as

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.040
well let me break it apart for you so
you can see what it looks like on the

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.170
inside
so this was the top of the reaction here

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.900
this is the stuff that came on the glass
first if I take that and just give it a

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.380
little twist you can see it breaks right
apart and look at all the bubbles that

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.510
were formed in there this is a light
frothy foam of carbon this is mostly

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.900
carbon but there is residue of sulfuric
acid on here as well so it might be a

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.320
good idea to have some baking soda
solution nearby so you could neutralize

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.289
that acid if you needed to but I'm
wearing gloves and I'm comfortable with

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:21.060
the risks right now and I'm finding that
this just really

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.080
stuff it feels firm but it definitely
feels a little bit spongy you can see

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.830
all the air pockets in there if I just
put it in my hand and squish it a little

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:37.590
bit Wow it turns to ash that's amazing
it completely crumbles with this stuff

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.440
being carbon makes me wonder if it would
be conductive could we make our own

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.550
carbon bridges our own carbon electrodes
out of sulfuric acid and sugar we should

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.730
try that with the arc furnace see if it
conducts electricity this is the part

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.880
here that was down in the glass I'm
going to break that apart for you and it

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.600
just snaps cleanly and evenly and
without any problem at all and you can

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.690
see even though this is firm this is a
piece that was down to glass and I think

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.020
maybe the sulfuric acid ran out and
that's why the reaction didn't continue

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.000
this top part is really crumbly but as
we get closer to the bottom here oh

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.620
that's crumbly as well haha and still
really hot ouch that's really hot crazy

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:17.430
crazy how much heat that captures watch
this

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:25.440
that's it it's gone easy as that okay
cool apparently now we have a process we

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.610
can make a black carbon foam with
slightly acidic residues let me explain

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.970
a little bit about what just happened
the sulfuric acid is a dehydrating agent

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.260
that means it wants water and sugar has
a lot of hydrogen and oxygen atoms in it

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.730
so the sulfuric acid violently rips that
hydrogen oxygen away to satisfy its need

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.780
for moisture that just leaves the
resulting carbon which bubbles up and

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.320
turns into this frothy foam which very
quickly cools and turns into the hard

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.800
black substance that we saw this makes
me wonder if we mixed up the concoction

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.190
put it into a flask like these what's
going to happen when the ash hits the

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.730
neck of the bottle is the bottles going
to build pressure and explode is the ash

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:03.090
going to reform itself and work its way
out of the channel normally is nothing

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:11.079
going to happen at all the purpose of
this experiment is to find out

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.190
I'm going to add a little bit more this
time so we get a full reaction you can

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.210
see how the sulfuric acid starts out
relatively clear and then as it mixes

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:25.199
with the sugar it starts to darken up
you know it's interesting about this is

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:29.040
I can't get it all the way to the bottom
I think we've got about 60 seconds

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.610
before the reaction takes place so we
want to get this mixed as much as

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:38.430
possible before that happens the flasks
still feels relatively cool when it

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.500
starts heating up I'll know it's time to
set it down and back away starting to

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:49.500
warm up what's going to happen is the
container going to explode here it goes

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:57.360
oh my goodness

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:05.819
oh wow it's spewing ash out of the top
like a little sulfuric acid volcano look

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:11.400
at all that steam and sulfur dioxide
coming off the top the reaction is still

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.229
going but nothing else is coming out is
it

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:21.510
is a container already empty I suppose
it is we'll need to let that cool down

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.510
for a minute where the stuff is pushing
out on the top like that it almost looks

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.810
like one of those black firework snakes
if you light and just growth

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:34.370
if this one is highly acidic I want to
get too close to that so the flasks did

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.500
not explode but the reaction was a
little bit different than I was

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.160
expecting as well it seems the carbon
sets up so quickly that by the time it

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:43.819
hits the top the pressure breaks it into
chunks and spews out kind of like a

00:07:43.819 --> 00:07:47.270
volcano spitting ash I was really
impressed at how quickly that reaction

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:50.330
took place once it got going once the
levels started rising the whole thing

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.919
only took about 10 seconds before it was
over that is extremely hot this stuff

00:07:54.919 --> 00:07:59.060
down here
gooey and spongy but very brittle look

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.229
at all these pieces of ash that clumped
off they look like little lava rocks but

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:08.800
they've got the same weight as styrofoam
peanuts they're extremely lightweight

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:15.110
smells like sugar and chemicals it's not
extremely pleasant but it's not too bad

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:20.060
either

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.410
instant ash brought to you by the King
around for one final experiment today I

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:28.010
want to try using a round flask to see
what kind of a difference if any that

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:34.520
makes

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:40.700
yeah it's starting to get pretty goopy
they're trying to mix it as best I can

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:52.500
it's starting to heat up here goes it's
like a black bubbling potion of evil

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:58.230
look at that spattering and spewing
everywhere oh gosh there's a lot of

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:04.740
pressure in there it's spitting it out
and of building the top at the same time

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:11.900
look at that

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:18.020
weird okay that was unexpected kind of
looks like a t-rex like a skeleton t-rex

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:22.160
it's got a little arm sticking out there
his open mouth and head spine

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.910
okay maybe t-rex is living a stretch but
does look really cool so what I saw

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:29.089
happening when this reaction took place
is it did get clogged but the pressure

00:09:29.089 --> 00:09:32.420
just kept pushing out the carbon and it
started spewing chunks up to about four

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.300
feet away and what was really
interesting is near the top little bits

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.150
of carbon would start to collect and
form a little tube and it started

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:41.960
building this chamber this black bridge
column that just continued one chunk

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.010
after another it was amazing very
similar I imagined how volcanoes build

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.700
themselves as well as the lava flows out
the chunks solidified the volcano grows

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:53.089
bigger and that's what we see happening
here it even kind of jetted off at a 45

00:09:53.089 --> 00:09:56.120
degree angle but it looks really cool
very cool reaction I wasn't actually

00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.440
expecting it to turn out that way but
I'm glad that it did interesting

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.820
I love the randomness in this design
what's amazing to me is there was

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:09.740
actually like a column inside this neck
look at that you can see the cavity is

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:12.350
completely filled up but there's a
little hole there which I imagine where

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:16.370
everything was spewing what's amazing is
that was able to continue this far

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:22.400
that's a good eight inches if we break
this in half yeah you can see that hole

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.830
continues right through it and if I keep
breaking this you can see that hole

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:32.720
continues through the entire length of
that neck so we actually made a sulfuric

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:38.270
carbon straw and it looks really cool
look at the texture to that awesome

00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.600
experiments guys let's talk about what
just happened we started off with the

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:45.020
classic experiment mixing sulfuric acid
with sugar but we did it with a little

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.540
bit of a twist
rather than using sulfuric acid from a

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:51.320
chemical lab we use sulfuric acid from
drain cleaner we found that when the two

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.320
substances were mixed nothing really
apparent seemed to happen right away

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:57.800
after that we found our container very
quickly warmed up and shot up a pillar

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.420
of black carbon ash we saw that the big
black carbon column pushing up out of

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:05.089
the glass looks a lot like those black
snake fireworks you see around the

00:11:05.089 --> 00:11:08.900
fourth of July and we found that this is
because sulfuric acid is a very strong

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.380
dehydrating agent and sucks the moisture
out of the sugar leaving nothing but the

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.189
black carbon residue
next we tried putting this mixture in an

00:11:15.189 --> 00:11:18.429
Erlenmeyer flask where the opening
constricts near the top to see if we get

00:11:18.429 --> 00:11:22.239
the container to explode but rather than
exploding we saw the pressure just push

00:11:22.239 --> 00:11:25.389
the carbon chunks up and out of the
container letting them flop down over

00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:29.199
the side for our final experiment we put
everything in a round bottom flask where

00:11:29.199 --> 00:11:33.189
even more pressure could build up but we
still didn't get it to explode instead

00:11:33.189 --> 00:11:36.189
what we saw happened was chunks of
carbon would spew out up to 4 feet away

00:11:36.189 --> 00:11:39.790
and the ones that collected near the top
coagulated together and formed a long

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:43.269
carbon tunnel which is something I
