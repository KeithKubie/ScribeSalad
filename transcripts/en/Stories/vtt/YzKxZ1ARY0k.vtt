[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.620
INTERVIEWER: This is Donnie
Vincent and he's a hunter.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.810
And yes, those giant
antlers he's holding on to,

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.110
those came from an animal he
tracked, hunted, and killed.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.650
For some of you, that may
be a tough thing to hear,

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.950
and this might be a
tough image to look that,

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.860
but the story of
why Donnie hunts

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.060
might make you look at this
picture in a new light.

00:00:29.534 --> 00:00:31.450
DONNIE VINCENT: Hi, my
name is Donnie Vincent.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.730
I reside in Hudson, Wisconsin.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.510
And I'm a filmmaker,
storyteller, archer,

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.400
and a hunter.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.640
This photo was taken on
the island of Newfoundland

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.570
in the Northeast region, near
a small town called Nambrok.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.060
It was taken, basically, on
an unnamed lake in the middle

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.605
of a wilderness tundra region.

00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:53.980
INTERVIEWER: Donnie
was on a trip

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.120
to hunt the woodland caribou,
but his expeditions are

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.650
a bit different than others.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.530
Beside his camping gear
and his bow and arrows,

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.841
he brings along filmmakers
to document his travels.

00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:08.090
DONNIE VINCENT: The photo
was taken by William Altman.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.910
That kid has followed
me all over the world

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.030
in some of the most trying
situations you can imagine.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.220
Alaska, Northwest Territories,
the Yukon Territories,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.070
Patagonia region
of South America.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.180
We've been surrounded
by packs of wolves,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.605
charged by grizzly bears.

00:01:21.605 --> 00:01:22.980
The goal is always
the same, just

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.530
to get fantastic images of
the wild places that we go

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.845
and to tell a fantastic story.

00:01:27.845 --> 00:01:29.720
INTERVIEWER: And the
story this picture tells

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.730
is one of a man who had to fight
the elements, to become part

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.420
of nature, in order to
complete the task that took him

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.170
to this cold and remote place.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:39.780
It's the story of an adventurer.

00:01:41.602 --> 00:01:43.060
DONNIE VINCENT:
There's much reward

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.380
that comes along with hunting.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.016
Everything from the places
that hunting takes me.

00:01:48.016 --> 00:01:49.640
There's something
special about sitting

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.215
on the side of a mountain and
watching a pack of wolves hunt

00:01:52.215 --> 00:01:54.340
a herd of caribou, and
watching animals participate

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.410
in their natural biology.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.570
I want to chase adventure.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.760
I have a need to go look.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.550
I want to see what's
over the next ridge.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.044
I have to see what's
over the next ridge.

00:02:04.044 --> 00:02:05.960
INTERVIEWER: But it's
also a story of a nature

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.430
lover and a concerned citizen.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.560
Donnie chose this
particular caribou bull

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.425
to kill with these
passions weighing on him.

00:02:12.425 --> 00:02:14.550
DONNIE VINCENT: It's
important to kill an old bull,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.490
because we want to be
hunters, but we have

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.047
to be conservationists first.

00:02:18.047 --> 00:02:20.130
This was the right animal
to take out of the herd.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.546
That this is an
animal that likely

00:02:21.546 --> 00:02:23.840
isn't going to make the winter.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.802
I'm not choosing to
be a hunter, this

00:02:25.802 --> 00:02:27.260
is something that
lives in my soul.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.707
This is something that I
inherited from my ancestors.

00:02:29.707 --> 00:02:32.040
In fact, it's something that
I think lives in all of us,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.665
and we all have this
piece of our brain

00:02:33.665 --> 00:02:35.770
that wants us to go
back to the beginning

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.000
and wants to participate
in hunting and gathering.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.810
But the world has set up this
infrastructure of grocery

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.584
stores and restaurants and
keeping everybody safe,

00:02:43.584 --> 00:02:45.000
and for me, I want
to go screaming

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.110
in the other direction.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.930
I want to get out
in the wilds more

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.010
and I want to have a
responsibility in going

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.260
through the process and know
exactly where my food has

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.350
come from.

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.100
INTERVIEWER: Donny
knows that what he does

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.220
is not for everyone, but that's
why he documents his hunts

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.861
and talks about his experiences.

00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:01.860
DONNIE VINCENT: Hunting
is riddled with unknowns

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.350
and difficulties.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.390
It's incredibly physical, the
weather is always challenging,

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.155
it's dangerous, but by and
large, the greatest difficulty

00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:10.955
is taking an animal's life.

00:03:10.955 --> 00:03:13.080
It's a really big decision
and something that comes

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.970
with tremendous responsibility.

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.720
It's never something
that we take lightly.

00:03:19.485 --> 00:03:21.610
INTERVIEWER: Hey everyone,
if you liked this video,

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.610
be sure to check out more
of Donnie's adventures

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.244
on his YouTube channel, here.

00:03:25.244 --> 00:03:26.785
DONNIE VINCENT: You
either have that,

00:03:26.785 --> 00:03:28.380
that willingness to go look.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.840
That willingness to
take one more step.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.140
That willingness
to be uncertain.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.550
Or you don't.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.390
INTERVIEWER: And don't
forget to subscribe.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.160
Thanks for watching.
