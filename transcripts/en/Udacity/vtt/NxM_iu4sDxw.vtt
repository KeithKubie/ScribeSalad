00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.560
So to update all the buttons we first simply select the years button container.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.380
Again, which is the parent div that we attached a class to.

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.930
And then select all the divs contained within our years buttons div, which

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.980
corresponds to each individual button, which we can then add our styling to.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.930
And once we've selected all the individual buttons,

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.220
again, a select all should return 20 buttons.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.509
We make a smooth transition using D3's animation functions and then

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.620
set the initial stylings on the buttons that they have before they're clicked.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.690
And since we're adding this code before we update the button that

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.020
is actually clicked.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.680
We don't have to worry, about having the clicked button, not be updated.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.780
So first we change all the buttons back including the button that was

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.720
clicked back to their initial styles and then once everything's reset, we can go

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.540
back and find the button that was clicked, and only update that single button.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.599
So as you can see here, we've refreshed the page,

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.990
we have our map which represents the state of the World Cup in 2014.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.530
And we have our buttons.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.310
Now let's see what happens when you click and individual button.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.050
As happen before the map has correctly updated and

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.710
the buttons color has correctly changed.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.600
Now let's see if our updates to the buttons,

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.440
which shouldn't be clicked has worked.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.320
As you can see here the previous button we clicked.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.970
Has gone back to its initial styling.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.250
The map is updated.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.020
And the current click button has changed to blue.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.980
And again, going to 1930, we can see this transition happen smoothly.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.920
And everything seems to be working.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.660
Now that's the end of the LiveCode example.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.870
And everything we'll be covering in this course.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.840
But don't feel like this is the limit of what we could do with a map or

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.230
D3 in general.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.020
I want to just recap what we did in this lesson since we did a lot of coding.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.140
And hopefully I've inspired you to go out and

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.100
create your own visualization or adapt what we've created in this course.
