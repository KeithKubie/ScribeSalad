 - That's how I felt.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.845 size:88% position:44%
 I understand where you all

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.865
- No, I'm saying no right there.

00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:07.633
 - That makes me uncomfortable.

00:01:07.666 --> 00:01:09.669
 - And then after all of that,

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:11.337 size:88% position:44%
  she made us both pancakes.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.271
