1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:05,290
[inaudible] joining me today is the
founder and president of live action,

2
00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:11,720
a pro life organization, which advocates
for the dignity of all human beings.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,520
Lila rose,
welcome to the Rubin report.

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,390
Thanks for having me,
Dave. I'm glad to be here.

5
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,670
Well,
I'm glad to be here too.

6
00:00:16,671 --> 00:00:21,671
You had reached out to me like a year
ago about having a civil conversation

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,050
about abortion.
Is that even remotely possible to do it?

8
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,790
We're going to do it. Are going to do it.
All right. We're going to see, because we,

9
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:32,690
we do, I think most people
watching this from the beginning,

10
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:35,360
just from the way I intro,
do you know that we have a,

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,310
a different position on this?
And that's okay.

12
00:00:37,311 --> 00:00:39,560
I've had this debate
and this conversation,

13
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:40,670
I don't even want to call it a debate.

14
00:00:40,671 --> 00:00:44,630
I've had this conversation with Ben
Shapiro and a series of other people. Um,

15
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,280
but this is the one, I mean, to me,

16
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:51,281
abortion is the one that is the most
polarizing and sort of just makes everyone

17
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:57,830
absolutely crazy. So let's put
it that there. And here we go.

18
00:00:57,831 --> 00:01:00,800
So just tell me a little bit about
yourself. First before we get into this.

19
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,700
Sure. So I'm, I head up this
non profit, not for profit,

20
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:07,340
but that's most of my time in life.

21
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,910
But I'm also big into my family.
That's really important to me.

22
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:15,500
I've got married last fall and regulation
actually have seven siblings. Wow.

23
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,800
So really prolife yeah, my
parents were anyway. Yeah.

24
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,490
And then I live in Berkeley
right now. Berkeley, California,

25
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,230
born and raised in San Jose.

26
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,160
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What are
you doing up in Berkeley? A good time.

27
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,470
Are they okay with your alternative
lifestyle up in Berkeley?

28
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,350
It's, yeah, it is very
alternative. But you know what?

29
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:38,890
More people are open minded on this then
I think we give each other credit for,

30
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:42,190
because people just assume they,
they have like an opinion on it.

31
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:44,630
But once you start to engage and
have a conversation, people are,

32
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:45,730
people can be very open minded.

33
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:49,270
So there definitely are people that are
just kind of your stereotypical set in

34
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:52,050
their ways. This is my ideology, right?

35
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,770
I've had some really good
conversations in Berkeley.

36
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,000
So I think people find it really
interesting to see how people have either

37
00:01:57,001 --> 00:02:00,420
evolved or not evolved or changed or
not changed when it comes to abortion.

38
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:04,020
Did you come from a family that was where,
I guess you just said your family was,

39
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,760
was prolife yeah.
Conservatives. Republicans.

40
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:10,340
Yeah, they would, I would, I definitely
think they identify as conservative.

41
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,790
They weren't necessarily activists.
So what, when I started live action,

42
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,350
I actually started as a teenager.

43
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,000
It was kind of an oddball thing because
they were not out there doing prolife

44
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:22,010
activate active activism are,
you know,

45
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:25,210
doing activism in any
really political kinds. Um,

46
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,740
but they were very
people that really cared.

47
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:31,010
My family really cared about peep other
people. They cared about education.

48
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:34,070
We were homeschooled,
so we had this alternative lifestyle.

49
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:38,210
They're kind of like hippies
in a different way because
they're all, you know,

50
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:42,710
big family homeschool. Um,
we, we had like chickens,

51
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,810
we've got some chickens
back. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:49,050
You can play with the chickens later.
I look forward to that. Yeah. So, okay,

53
00:02:49,051 --> 00:02:51,360
so you've got into this topic.

54
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,510
I mean you started doing activism
related to abortion when you were in high

55
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:59,530
school? Yes. Yeah. How did
that possibly come to be?

56
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,910
Yeah, so we, we, again, it
was kind of alternatives.

57
00:03:01,911 --> 00:03:04,820
I was actually taking like
college classes when I was 12.

58
00:03:04,821 --> 00:03:09,230
Like we had a really kind of
mismatch or a patchwork education.

59
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:12,500
We did all kinds of, you know, where I
was going to some high school classes,

60
00:03:12,501 --> 00:03:13,400
some college classes.

61
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:17,630
So there's a lot of free
time and flexibility in my
schedule and I had a lot of

62
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,200
passion and ability to
pursue things I loved.

63
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,140
And when I found out about abortion,
I was just very, very concerned. Um,

64
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,660
I was really interested in all kinds
of human rights issues. I was really,

65
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:32,840
you know, I was involved
in like volunteering with
children with disabilities,

66
00:03:32,841 --> 00:03:37,070
volunteering with homeless ministry,
you know, house building and in Mexico,

67
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:39,770
in Tijuana, um, famine
relief in this year.

68
00:03:39,771 --> 00:03:43,760
So I was really into just
wanting my life to be, you know,

69
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,990
stirrup give back.

70
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,710
And when I found out about abortion and
I started to really consider what was

71
00:03:48,711 --> 00:03:51,470
happening. So there's 3000
abortions every day in America.

72
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,240
So that's a million a year.

73
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,980
And I started to look at the fetal
development and see just how amazing this

74
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:01,520
little life is even in the first
trimester that this is alive and just the

75
00:04:01,521 --> 00:04:05,180
violence abortion does to that life.
And I was learning all this as like,

76
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,620
you know,
my early teens.

77
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:10,780
I was just deeply struck because I
thought if this is really life or be,

78
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,120
if these are really humans like you
and I are humans and you and I started,

79
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,380
you know, embryo Dave, you know,

80
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:20,660
back in the day and realize we all are
in the same year, very fashionable.

81
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:25,610
I'm sure. Yeah, I'm in Utero. But we all
started that way and I was just thinking,

82
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,420
I thought, I realized this is
the greatest human rights issue.

83
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,000
I can get involved in
a lot of other causes.

84
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,830
There's a lot of things to care about,

85
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:36,920
but this is life and death
for 3000 people a day.

86
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,800
And they're people that are
not protected by the law.

87
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,780
They're seen as society as less
than not human and women girls.

88
00:04:44,781 --> 00:04:47,660
I mean as a woman and as a, as a young
woman, very young women at the time,

89
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:52,661
I just thought I'm being told that
taking this life is a good thing,

90
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,090
can be a really good thing for me.
And I just thought, how can this be?

91
00:04:56,091 --> 00:04:58,130
This is a violence violent act.

92
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,910
So that really inspired me
just to begin live action.

93
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:06,770
And the idea was I just need to get a
group of friends together to do community

94
00:05:06,771 --> 00:05:07,490
education.

95
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,150
Basically community organizing to educate
other young people in high school and

96
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:14,480
junior high about what
abortion actually is about.

97
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,750
Embryonic and fetal development
about the risks to women.

98
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:22,640
No one talks about the risks to women
about the way it's harmed society and how

99
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:26,660
this is not peace and justice.
This is actually violence and injustice.

100
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,040
And if we want to be better together
and be more loving and be more,

101
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,330
more compassionate, we need to eradicate
this all together from our society.

102
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,420
Okay. So I want to touch on a lot of
those issues that you just brought up.

103
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:42,800
So you start live action as
a, as a young teenager, um,

104
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:46,670
how did it go? Were you, were
you immediately a attack?

105
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:50,470
Did your friends all want to
join on board? I mean, what,
what was that like? Yeah.

106
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,580
To just put yourself as
a young person out there.

107
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:54,470
Because I get so much email now from,

108
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,590
from kids that are in high
school that whatever their is,

109
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,930
they're starting a young libertarian club,

110
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:02,660
there's nothing and just the amount of
hate that they deal with and all that.

111
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,030
Yeah.

112
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:07,650
Yeah. I mean we definitely got a lot of
rejection, um, because very few people,

113
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,370
like when we were pursuing schools to
give presentations at schools or even

114
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,151
churches meeting,

115
00:06:12,151 --> 00:06:14,880
got rejection from churches because
we want it to go and develop this very

116
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:17,790
professional presentation
on like the facts. Right.

117
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,360
And we got training and we really did
our research and we developed this whole

118
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:26,220
program and literally it took a whole
year to convince the first church to let

119
00:06:26,221 --> 00:06:29,940
us come in and give a presentation to the,
to the youth group there. And it took,

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,570
you know,

121
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:34,590
several months and the two years to really
start getting schools to allow us to

122
00:06:34,591 --> 00:06:36,300
come and give presentations.
But we did. Yeah.

123
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,450
Why would you be getting pushback from
churches that I assumed were completely

124
00:06:39,451 --> 00:06:40,740
ideologically aligned?

125
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,240
Well,

126
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,410
just because you're ideologically aligned
in theory doesn't always mean you're

127
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,420
aligned in practice.
So unfortunately,

128
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:49,370
even in the church and a lot
of Christian communities,

129
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:53,120
abortion isn't talked about. Um,
women are having abortions. You know,

130
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,910
even some people are encouraging
women to have abortions,

131
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:59,090
like even pastors and some situations like
privately behind the scenes, you know,

132
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:00,170
if their daughter gets pregnant.

133
00:07:00,171 --> 00:07:02,450
So there's some really awful
things that happen like that.

134
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:04,820
And there's this fear of the offense.

135
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,670
It's a fear of offending
their congregation. Um,

136
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,660
or it's just this wanting to be mister
nice guy all the time or Mrs Mrs,

137
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:14,450
nice guy or a nice girl, whatever. Um,

138
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:17,630
and so people are afraid to talk
about the tough things, even when,

139
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,690
according to the research
that has been done,

140
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,760
the people who are having abortions,

141
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:28,390
as many people identify as Protestant or
Catholic as secular and not no religion

142
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:29,420
who have abortion.

143
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,630
So you have people who are maybe
not going to church every Sunday,

144
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:36,560
but who have some sort of fake
background who are not really educated.

145
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:39,020
And not really empowered so that
they're also having an abortion.

146
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:42,740
So that's part of the battle
is getting this message,

147
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,930
forget what your religious label is,

148
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:47,210
getting it to people so it
really touches their hearts.

149
00:07:47,211 --> 00:07:50,690
And then you make any inroads
in the church community
to provide the support for

150
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:52,280
women who faced unexpected pregnancy.

151
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,770
Were you shocked at just how hard it
was just getting the conversation going?

152
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:58,140
Because the way I always frame
this is if you listen to, you know,

153
00:07:58,141 --> 00:08:00,360
broadly speaking, if you listened to, uh,

154
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,000
how the media deals with this
is if you're on the right,

155
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:05,820
that means you hate women,
you want to somehow control women.

156
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:09,690
And if you're on the left and you're pro
choice, that means that you hate babies.

157
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:12,510
I mean, that's basically how it's
framed and not just through the media.

158
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,000
That's basically how our
politicians are framing it.

159
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,040
How did you find you could sort of get
past just the box that people look at it?

160
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:20,180
Yes.

161
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,700
Talk to people.
I mean listen than most of our,

162
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,720
most of our impression of what the left
really says on the right really says,

163
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:30,980
or what abortion act, you know,
advocates supposedly really are saying,

164
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:34,460
meaning just a normal person who
identifies as pro choice like their

165
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:36,750
representatives and media.
Um,

166
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,850
versus what we see or what we think are
the representatives for prolife often

167
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:45,851
displayed in media are not the actual
fullness of the position and they're not

168
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:47,150
actually dialoguing.

169
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:52,100
So the benefit of being a teenager at
the time and talking to like sitting down

170
00:08:52,101 --> 00:08:55,070
with the youth pastor or going to the
school administrators and trying to get

171
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,340
inroads was that I was able to just
talk to them as a human to a human and

172
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:02,610
discuss what we could bring to the
table, discuss, you know, our program.

173
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,690
And it wasn't,
you know,

174
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,380
two people debating in five minutes
segments on a TV show. You know.

175
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:10,440
So I think when people actually talk
to each other and your communities,

176
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,220
things change, you know, when they
actually have a respectful dialogue.

177
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,900
It doesn't seem that way though.

178
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:19,230
If you were to watch TV or look at news
headlines because it looks like the

179
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:20,760
world is so crazy polarized.

180
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:25,380
Yeah. So, okay. So if we were just sort
of starting from the beginning here,

181
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:30,120
if you were sitting across from somebody
and let's say they were neither here

182
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:31,050
nor there on the issue,

183
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:34,200
they didn't feel strongly either way
or they just wanted more information,

184
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:36,390
what are some of the things
that you would be telling them?

185
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,010
Sure. So I would start by first of all,
finding the common ground with them.

186
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:43,610
I would say, you know, do you think,
and I'd ask you Dave, you know,

187
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,670
do you think that it's always wrong
to intentionally take a human life and

188
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:50,220
innocent human life?

189
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:55,110
Like is it always wrong to intentionally
take an innocent human life and pretty

190
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:57,120
much like 99.9% of people,
yeah,

191
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,620
I'm going to wait on answers so that
when we get to ours, our differences,

192
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:01,454
I think it'll

193
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:03,890
no, they all say yes.
Yeah. Intentionally wrong,

194
00:10:03,891 --> 00:10:07,700
too indirect to directly take an innocent
human life. And I was like, okay, great.

195
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,500
We all agree.
So number two,

196
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:14,530
abortion is the intentional and direct
taking of an innocent human life.

197
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,680
And that's usually where we like really.
Tell me more about that.

198
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,360
And then obviously the last conclusion
would be therefore a abortion is always

199
00:10:23,361 --> 00:10:25,250
wrong.
But then we have to unpack all,

200
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,090
why is abortion always the intentional
and direct taking of an innocent human

201
00:10:29,091 --> 00:10:30,050
life? Well, first of all,

202
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:35,350
we know because science shows us that a
unique individual human life begins as a

203
00:10:36,111 --> 00:10:38,240
single cell embryo at the
moment of fertilization.

204
00:10:38,241 --> 00:10:40,190
Like you and I both
began our life that way.

205
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,560
And from that moment
our sex was determined.

206
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,410
Our eye color or hair
color within three weeks,

207
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:48,380
our heart started to beat
within six weeks are nervous.

208
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,450
Our brainwaves are starting to,
you know,

209
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:52,940
that we can be detected
within seven weeks.

210
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,730
So you believe that life
begins at conception?

211
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,590
It's not,
I wouldn't call it a belief,

212
00:10:56,591 --> 00:11:00,370
I'd call it an acknowledgement and
acknowledgement that life begins at

213
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:02,920
conception. And then we know like you
actually look at abortion procedures,

214
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,210
there's no debate.

215
00:11:04,211 --> 00:11:09,211
I mean they intentionally directly
dismember disembowel destroy that child,

216
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:15,550
that life, that human life. In the
first, second and third trimester.

217
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,600
So because of those two
facts, you know, abortion,

218
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,180
the intentional taking of an
innocent human life is wrong.

219
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,630
So, okay. So there's a lot of, a
lot of ways we could go here. So,

220
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,300
alright, let, let's do, we'll do some
of the more sciencey stuff first. Um,

221
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,230
in cases where there is a
threat to the mother. Leslie,

222
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:37,970
we'll just rifle off a few of these.
What,

223
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,420
what position do you think
is right or just or fair?

224
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,110
Yeah,
that's a very good and important question.

225
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:46,720
And there are certainly
cases where pregnancy can be,

226
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,810
have complications or severe complications
if those were to be the case.

227
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:56,530
The intentional direct taking of that
innocent human life and abortion is not a

228
00:11:56,531 --> 00:11:57,460
medical treatment.

229
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,810
This is a big confusion that often
happens in kind of pro life pro choice

230
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,100
soundbite debating.

231
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,190
Like we're not actually talking to
each other because they're like, well,

232
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:10,810
women need abortion for health. And when
you actually unpack it, early delivery.

233
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:14,490
So in some severe cases, for
example, if there are, um,

234
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,880
ruptured membranes are infected membranes
inside the uterus so that you know

235
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:20,470
that those are attached to the baby.

236
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,520
In some cases you might have to sit for
severe infections that starting to form,

237
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:27,760
you might have to deliver the baby early.

238
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,530
That's not an abortion,

239
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,640
that's not targeting the baby's body
for destruction using forceps or using

240
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:38,320
drugs that's delivering the child because
she's she or he is attached to a part

241
00:12:38,321 --> 00:12:41,690
of a woman's body that's
causing infection. So that
would not be an abortion.

242
00:12:41,691 --> 00:12:46,210
I'm pro life and pro choice agree that
in some cases that may be necessary.

243
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,880
And, but for any other
case, like for example,

244
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:51,670
if I get chemo or if I get
cancer and I need chemo,

245
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,430
you don't have an abortion,

246
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:59,380
you might choose to undergo chemo and
that's in targeting the cancer cells might

247
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:01,330
harm the baby and the baby
there might be miscarriage,

248
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:02,380
but that's not an abortion.

249
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,560
So you can do any number of treatments
as a woman who's pregnant who might have

250
00:13:05,561 --> 00:13:07,630
complications or may
have other conditions.

251
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,560
But the direct taking of that life going
in there and targeting that baby for

252
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:14,050
destruction is not a medical treatment.

253
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:14,521
Right.

254
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:19,521
So are there no cases where it's a direct
threat to the woman's life that then

255
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,020
there,

256
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:26,400
there are cases where the things related
to pregnancy might be a threat like for

257
00:13:26,401 --> 00:13:29,460
example,
ruptured or I'm infected membranes,

258
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,090
but that in that situation,
delivering the child early,

259
00:13:33,091 --> 00:13:36,240
that's not going in there to tear
the child apart with, I mean,

260
00:13:36,241 --> 00:13:38,010
the way abortions are done,
abortions aren't done yet.

261
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,640
You're just putting in effect if the
child wasn't ready to be given birth to

262
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:45,190
right. And that would be a really
tragic case. But in that situation,

263
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,150
there should be careful management of the
pregnancy to try to allow that baby to

264
00:13:49,151 --> 00:13:52,690
live for as long as possible in the womb
so that there would be a chance for the

265
00:13:52,691 --> 00:13:57,630
baby to be delivered alive. But the point
is not using just the, uh, you know,

266
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,020
four Stan, I'd Jay lethal injection
to kill that child before delivery,

267
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,090
but trying to give that child a chance.

268
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,570
And if that child were to die after
delivery because he or she is too premium,

269
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,930
too much of a premium premium keeps
getting pushed back and back as you know,

270
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:11,764
like 21,

271
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,270
it's 21 weeks now that some babies and
a half that can survive after birth.

272
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:20,530
It's amazing. They're so teeny, but
we should at least give him a chance.

273
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,990
And that's,
that's it's a total mentality shift.

274
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,320
The mentality shift is are we
going to attempt to save this life,

275
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,740
this life of the child as well as we
treat the mother or are we going to just

276
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:31,600
say this life is not a life.
Right.

277
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,550
And we can target his or her body
for destruction before birth.

278
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,620
Okay. So that's dealing
with health of the mother.

279
00:14:38,621 --> 00:14:42,400
So what about cases of where its
health of the fetus or of the Child?

280
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:47,401
So I know somebody within the last year
or so that had an abortion a little bit

281
00:14:47,801 --> 00:14:52,640
after 20 weeks. I think because
the child had severely, severely,

282
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,160
um, uh, under developed brain and the,

283
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:59,570
and the doctor said this was not going
to be anything remotely close to a,

284
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:02,780
to a functional life if,
if it survived in the first place.

285
00:15:02,781 --> 00:15:04,520
So where do you stand in a case like that?

286
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,241
I mean,

287
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:09,650
I would first say if there was a toddler
with a severely underdeveloped brain,

288
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,660
is it okay to take the life of that
toddler because you have a severely

289
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:18,570
underdeveloped brain or you have even
a life threatening condition that you,

290
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,040
you have a terminal illness.
Does that mean you should be killed?

291
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,840
You know what,

292
00:15:23,841 --> 00:15:27,560
like why don't we treat you with love and
try to eliminate the suffering and not

293
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:32,420
the sufferer or try to serve the patient
and not see them as somebody that we

294
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:36,440
can just kill. So I think we just
need a total mentality shift.

295
00:15:36,441 --> 00:15:38,930
And if we acknowledge
that these are humans,

296
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,380
like a toddler or an infant as a human,
if an infant is a human,

297
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,830
then before birth, that
same child, you know,

298
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,800
whether it's weeks or months earlier
in their development is a human.

299
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,100
Humans begat Hume as you can't,
it's not like a different species.

300
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:56,600
This is a human individual, unique
life. They deserve the same,

301
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,500
they deserve the same care and protection
that an infant does. So we shouldn't,

302
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,790
we don't leave infants to die.

303
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,940
We shouldn't leave infants to today
because they have a life threatening

304
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:08,180
condition or because they
have a severe disability.

305
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,850
So does the state then,

306
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,620
oh the mother where the parents,
let's say anything. If if the state,

307
00:16:15,621 --> 00:16:18,350
let's say there's someone like this
case I just laid out to you where this

308
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:22,130
person, they just disagree
with your premise there.

309
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:24,680
They just feel that they should
be allowed to do what they want,

310
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,500
but then the state says, no,
you cannot have that abortion.

311
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:29,600
You have to bring this
child into the world.

312
00:16:29,601 --> 00:16:32,390
They fight and now let's
assume that the child survives.

313
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:35,630
It has all sorts of problems that they
don't want to deal with in the state.

314
00:16:35,631 --> 00:16:38,490
Forced them to, to bring it to term. Yeah.

315
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,520
Do you think there's any responsibility
of the state there? Yeah,

316
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,320
cause this is where I find a little
bit of the conservative argument. Yeah.

317
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,360
To be tough because it's like,
well, okay, I get it. You,

318
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,060
you're trying to protect life.
I can go with you on that.

319
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:53,780
But then at the same time, if are, if
you're using the state to force that,

320
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,290
well you also don't want the state to
be supporting people and now you have a

321
00:16:57,291 --> 00:17:00,590
little bit of a chasm there in,
in the logic.

322
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,970
Yeah, it's a good question. I say,
first of all, you have to be consistent.

323
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:09,360
If it is he or she is a life
before birth then and it didn't,

324
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,070
she is a life after birth.
If she's a life after birth,

325
00:17:12,071 --> 00:17:15,080
she's the life he or she has a
life before birth. So you know,

326
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:17,890
if you're looking at it from the pro
choice perspective of it's not a life,

327
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,990
then you can do whatever you
want. Like I don't, you know,

328
00:17:19,991 --> 00:17:22,540
if you can prove to me this
is not a human life, I'm fine.

329
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,540
You do whatever you want.

330
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,660
Right.
So I think that would be my view.

331
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,360
That would be a pretty
extreme position for I,

332
00:17:27,361 --> 00:17:29,860
I don't find that many people
saying it's not a life after,

333
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,180
but I think that in a of weeks consistent,
if you're a human life,

334
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,230
do you have human rights?
You know,

335
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,140
I think it's just about
consistency and it's about,

336
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,050
so this is the logic side and then I'll
address like what you described as the

337
00:17:40,051 --> 00:17:40,500
compassionate,

338
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,410
but I think we have to be logically
consistent cause we kind of like our,

339
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,910
it's like our brains start turning off.

340
00:17:44,911 --> 00:17:49,911
I think sometimes on this if he or she
is a human life before and science kids

341
00:17:50,701 --> 00:17:55,020
conclusive about that. You know, the, the
United, the United Nations Declaration,

342
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:57,090
Universal Declaration on
human rights that has,

343
00:17:57,091 --> 00:18:00,300
that all members of the human
family have these rights.

344
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,200
And then an article six that
says that these are, you know,

345
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,340
anybody who's a member of the human
family has a right to be seen as a person

346
00:18:08,341 --> 00:18:11,730
under the law. These are members
of the human family. They smaller,

347
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:16,050
they're more dependent. They're, they're,
they're, they're very fragile. You know,

348
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:19,080
they need time in nourishment to grow,
but they're members of the human family,

349
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,950
so they deserve to be treated
that way. Um, but in your city,

350
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,840
in the case you mentioned,
you know, I think it's, uh,

351
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,560
it's obviously very complex because if
you're, if you're like, you know, has,

352
00:18:28,561 --> 00:18:33,000
have socioeconomic struggles,
you're not able to care for it seriously,

353
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,570
a child, a serious disabilities
or a life threatening condition,

354
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:39,030
you're a terminal illness,
then yes.

355
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:43,170
I think that there needs
to be a appreciation for
that and in our society or

356
00:18:43,171 --> 00:18:46,590
communities should be supporting
those families. And you know,

357
00:18:46,591 --> 00:18:49,350
if the family is really not able to care
that parents really not able to care,

358
00:18:49,351 --> 00:18:53,370
there should be a way that they can place
their child for adoption or find other

359
00:18:53,371 --> 00:18:55,130
caretakers for that child.
And Yeah.

360
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,770
Don't you think that's
on the state though?

361
00:18:56,771 --> 00:18:59,950
Or do you think that can just be done
with churches and synagogues? Yeah,

362
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:04,600
I think it's best people closest
and most intimate in the community.

363
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,550
So I'm a big believer in subsidiarity.

364
00:19:06,551 --> 00:19:11,551
So this idea that the best resource are
the best solutions for our community

365
00:19:11,711 --> 00:19:15,610
will be as meant as localized as
possible. Um, that being said,

366
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:19,390
there will be situations where the
community isn't available or if somebody

367
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:23,860
fails somebody. And so I do think that
there should be backups. I think that,

368
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:27,700
you know, I, I think a lot of the systems
we have in place, they're very imperfect,

369
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,790
like, you know, for born
children. Um, for infants,

370
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:34,750
for children who suffer serious disability
for infants or children from families

371
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:38,560
that are not taking care of them, you
know, with addictions or abuse. You know,

372
00:19:38,561 --> 00:19:41,860
I think the foster care system needs
a ton of work. I think that, um,

373
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,900
but I'm grateful that it exists.
You know,

374
00:19:43,901 --> 00:19:47,320
I'm grateful that we have some programs,
some state programs.

375
00:19:47,321 --> 00:19:50,110
I think the more localized in,
the more we can empower local communities,

376
00:19:50,111 --> 00:19:54,130
the better. So I'm not against those
things. I think they need to be improved.

377
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,730
But I think those same things should
apply to the child before birth. It's not,

378
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,540
again, we have to be consistent.
If this is a human life, they,

379
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,820
they deserve protection.
Just like a boring life,

380
00:20:03,821 --> 00:20:05,620
whether you're before birth or after.

381
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:09,060
Yeah. So when we talk about the science
part of this, if, if something in science,

382
00:20:09,061 --> 00:20:11,610
I mean a lot of this has to do
with the way people just view,

383
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,950
I think the nature of reality
and and really, you know
what science verse belief,

384
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:20,700
I mean it's all here, which is why this
topic is so difficult to talk about.

385
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,940
If science could somehow prove to you
that say that life in essence doesn't

386
00:20:26,401 --> 00:20:28,770
begin until three weeks in,

387
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,710
could that shift your position on this?

388
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:32,860
MMM.

389
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,530
That you know that the egg meets
the sperm, okay. Conception,

390
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:40,210
but then for three weeks the
whatever that is at that point,

391
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,900
it actually doesn't qualify as as life
by a sort of technical scientific.

392
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,730
Hmm. I feel like even in the questions,
a little bit of a contradiction,

393
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:53,731
just because you said three weeks
from something is when life begins.

394
00:20:53,831 --> 00:20:55,090
Well,
three weeks from what?

395
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:58,750
Well, dude, that's why I brought up the
question because this is where everybody's

396
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,200
definition of everything I think is a,
you know,

397
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:06,460
you can look at a three week fetus is
obviously very different than what it's

398
00:21:06,461 --> 00:21:08,310
gonna look like at six
months and everything. Yeah,

399
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:13,270
it's really different as a baby. Like
baby Dave had a massive head as it did.

400
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,460
I write like,
nope,

401
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,780
humans are supposed to look different at
different stages of development. Um, but,

402
00:21:18,781 --> 00:21:22,450
but I think, look, what does the IVF
specialists trying to get in a lab?

403
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,880
What are they obsessed
with getting in there,

404
00:21:24,881 --> 00:21:26,380
trying to create life in a test tube.

405
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,160
They're obsessed with getting the meeting
of us for a minute egg, the fusion,

406
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,450
that moment of fertilization.

407
00:21:31,451 --> 00:21:34,330
Then they have a single cell embryo and
they know that and they'll tell their

408
00:21:34,331 --> 00:21:37,720
client the family we have,
you know, 10 embryos,

409
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,510
you can implant three or
whatever, right? I mean,

410
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,690
they're obsessed with getting that moment,
that special moment in a test you,

411
00:21:43,691 --> 00:21:48,040
because that moment means something and
the, the science on this is conclusive.

412
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:52,930
But that moment means is you have
a unique individual life that needs

413
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:56,200
nourishment to grow. So you, it
cannot survive outside the womb.

414
00:21:56,201 --> 00:21:58,510
It can survive outside of the test you,
but it needs,

415
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,760
it needs a ton of support to grow.

416
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:05,350
But if you give it that support and if
you don't interrupt his or her life,

417
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:10,270
kill it, then he or she will become
one day, you know, an adult, you know,

418
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,250
one day will grow into, you know, the,
the person and then eventually pass away.

419
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,730
As we all know, we die so that it's
human lifespan. And that's conclusive.

420
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,860
There is that meme that I always find,

421
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:24,070
it's hard to get my way out of which
it's like they'll show like, you know,

422
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:26,710
a month old fetus and they'll say that,
you know,

423
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:31,180
everyone agrees that this is life.
And then they'll show or you know,

424
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:33,070
or the people on the, you know,
everyone on the right, basically,

425
00:22:33,071 --> 00:22:36,100
we'll agree that this is like people
on the left, we'll say this isn't life.

426
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:39,310
And then they show, you know, like a speck
of something on Mars and they'll say,

427
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:42,560
well, you know, all these
scientists say this is life.
And it's like, ah, that's good

428
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:43,390
human life.

429
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:46,720
I mean there's a lot of life out there
but we're talking about something very

430
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:49,780
special, which is human life. And
that's why like even the United Nations,

431
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:52,460
and I don't know if they're United
Nation fans here, but even they have,

432
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,500
yeah, I'm not a huge fan of the
United Nations generally speaking.

433
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,350
A lot of reasons.

434
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:59,310
They actually are contradictory
in their policies, but their,

435
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:02,790
but their principals say, you know,
all members of the human family,

436
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,390
all members of the human family.
So you know, and I think, look,

437
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,870
it's not just right versus left. I think
on this, you know, I'm from California,

438
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:12,360
I live in Berkeley right now.
I went to school at Ucla,

439
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:17,070
like I've met people on left
and right who are pro life.

440
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:21,340
And in the pro life movement there
are atheists, there are secularists.

441
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,600
There are people who are more
left wing who are also pro life.

442
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,960
So this is unfortunately it
seen in the media. And it's art.

443
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:30,960
It's because the Democratic Party
has like abandoned prolife ideas,

444
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,440
which is really sad because I think you,
there are pro life Democrats out there.

445
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:39,000
Um, I think a lot of Democrats are
prolife actually the majority of them want

446
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:42,180
abortion restrictions,
but they're not getting their day.

447
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,130
They're not getting representation.
You know,

448
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:49,131
they're getting these senators like all
the democratic senators who are running

449
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:54,020
for office like Kamala, Cory
Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, uh,

450
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,620
Warren, um, Stanton, Bernie Sanders.
I mean he goes, he's not democratic,

451
00:23:57,621 --> 00:24:02,180
but he basically hit all of them are
the most pro abortion people ever.

452
00:24:02,181 --> 00:24:03,860
They're there for abortion
through all nine months.

453
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:06,870
Right? So, okay, so let's, let's
bring that to sort of where on that,

454
00:24:06,871 --> 00:24:09,780
because they are making my life
difficult for this because I,

455
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,500
I often describe myself as begrudgingly
pro choice. I view this as,

456
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:18,600
I think I do this probably as
horrifically a choice as you do.

457
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,270
You don't, you don't think it's
a choice per se, but I view the,

458
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:24,180
the idea here is as probably
as horrific as you do.

459
00:24:24,181 --> 00:24:27,510
I don't think that something
at 18 weeks is not alive.

460
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:30,580
So when I discussed this with
ban my Ben Shapiro, my position,

461
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:35,190
this was I think a little over a year
ago, um, and the clip really took off.

462
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:38,700
Uh, my position at the time
was that at 20 weeks they've,

463
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,110
there is more than ample evidence that
the fetus can start feeling pain and I

464
00:24:43,111 --> 00:24:48,090
would view that up until that point
that I would leave the choice with the

465
00:24:48,091 --> 00:24:51,930
mother. That, that I, that it's not a
good choice. I'm not defending the choice.

466
00:24:51,931 --> 00:24:53,550
I'm not moralizing about the choice,

467
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,570
but that that's just the position that
I would want the power to be with the

468
00:24:57,571 --> 00:24:58,800
person that is here now.

469
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:02,130
Now Ben said to me something
that you already alluded
to, which is which if, well,

470
00:25:02,131 --> 00:25:03,540
if you're saying it's a life at 20 weeks,

471
00:25:03,541 --> 00:25:07,260
you're obviously acknowledging it's a
life at 18 weeks and to be logically

472
00:25:07,261 --> 00:25:10,260
consistent,
I had to concede that point because yes,

473
00:25:10,261 --> 00:25:14,220
I am acknowledging that I'm just allowing
the life that's here and now to sort

474
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:16,470
of supersede in the, in
the decision making. Okay.

475
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,580
Why did, why did we have this
mindset like let's imagine,

476
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,920
I mean there are women that killed
killer infants that are born,

477
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:25,010
they're born alive infant. I mean
there's just a horrible case in Texas.

478
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:30,011
This poor girl who you know had gave birth
and stabbed the baby to death and now

479
00:25:30,081 --> 00:25:32,660
she's being tried for murder.
You know that very severe penalties,

480
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:35,810
which is a whole other debate,
right? But it's like, why do we,

481
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,220
why aren't we consistent on it?

482
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:42,200
Is it because the infant or the 20 week
old can feel pain is pain that the kind

483
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:44,210
of ticket to legal protection,

484
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:47,030
like my ability to feel pain
because what if I was paralyzed?

485
00:25:47,031 --> 00:25:47,864
I couldn't feel pain.

486
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,110
Right? So again, I don't think it's, I
don't think it's a perfectly air tight,

487
00:25:52,111 --> 00:25:54,630
logical argument.
My,

488
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,440
my deference though is to the
mother. Now, I would say this,

489
00:25:58,441 --> 00:26:00,810
and this is why I prefaced it
by what you just did with the,

490
00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:02,130
with the Democrats right now,

491
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:07,430
is that they have now gone seemingly
so far extreme on abortion,

492
00:26:07,951 --> 00:26:11,850
where it's now we're talking
late trimester and then
there was that really awful

493
00:26:11,851 --> 00:26:16,190
video of the governor of
Virginia, right? Yeah, yeah. Uh,

494
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:20,790
talking about decisions that could
be made after Bert. Yeah. Yeah.

495
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:23,760
They've gotten so extreme
that I'm finding, I'm finding,

496
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,570
I'm finding holding what I think
is somewhat moderate position here.

497
00:26:27,571 --> 00:26:29,100
I'm finding to be just very different.

498
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,091
Yeah.
I mean,

499
00:26:30,091 --> 00:26:33,150
I hear you and I think it's because
they're actually being consistent.

500
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:36,990
That's the thing on, on abortion.
I don't think that you can have a,

501
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,950
when it comes to looking at when life
begins, when life should be protected,

502
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,170
I don't think you can have a moderate,
moderate.

503
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,880
It's either it is a life and
it should be protected here.

504
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,340
She should be protected or he or
she is not a life. And we as adults,

505
00:26:50,341 --> 00:26:53,310
the strong people in the room,
the mom or the the doctor,

506
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:58,311
we get to decide when that life deserves
protection or when that life can be

507
00:26:58,531 --> 00:27:03,210
killed. So I think that actually in a
way, as as repulsive as the Democrats,

508
00:27:03,211 --> 00:27:04,050
like you know,

509
00:27:04,051 --> 00:27:07,950
crazy abortion through all nine months
and lead the infant to die after birth as,

510
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,690
as crazy it sounds to most people,

511
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,200
they're actually being consistent
because they're saying, well,

512
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:18,120
it's a helpless dependent infant.
Slash fetus. Slash. Embryo.

513
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:23,490
I decide as the adult when I can
confer on, you know, the value on this,

514
00:27:23,491 --> 00:27:26,970
I get to make the final medical decision
right as they see at a medical decision.

515
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:31,380
So leave me alone. Like leave me alone
state, let me do what I want to do.

516
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,000
And it,
yeah,

517
00:27:33,001 --> 00:27:37,320
I think that they're actually
being consistent if they
really think that we have

518
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:38,850
the right to take some lives.

519
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,980
So how much of this discussion is just
that you think people don't really think

520
00:27:41,981 --> 00:27:44,030
through their positions?
Because like I,

521
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:48,760
I've thought about this a lot and I get
you, I really, I hear you and I find this,

522
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,190
you know, who knows what I'll, what
I'll think in, in 20 years and we Ryan,

523
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:55,450
who knows what you'll think in 20 years
or whatever. But that, but that's what,

524
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:59,730
that's what really thinking through an
issue is about. And, and, and you know,

525
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,040
there's also an irony here because
you know, for someone like myself,

526
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:05,740
if you take a classical liberal
or libertarian position on this,

527
00:28:05,741 --> 00:28:08,710
you believe in the individual above
anything. So my position has been,

528
00:28:08,711 --> 00:28:11,860
well in the individual, I'm looking
at it through the woman's choice.

529
00:28:11,861 --> 00:28:15,280
Now I get the counter argument. I've heard
this from a lot of libertarians. Well,

530
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:18,800
if you really believe in the individual,
there's an individual right there,

531
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,780
the fetus is the individual. Um, but how
much of this is just that people don't,

532
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,240
people don't want to do this.

533
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,220
Yeah,
I think it is a lot of that.

534
00:28:27,221 --> 00:28:30,820
I think that most people would
actually come to the pro life position.

535
00:28:30,821 --> 00:28:32,120
And when I say probably position that,

536
00:28:32,121 --> 00:28:36,330
so I think weighted down with
these like political, you know,

537
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:40,510
edge to it. Like, well that means you're
like a Republican and you love Trump.

538
00:28:40,511 --> 00:28:43,150
If you're pro life, it's like, no,
that's actually not true. You know?

539
00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:45,580
Prolife it says all humans are,

540
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:48,760
all human lives are precious and
have the same human rights. I mean,

541
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:52,030
I think that's the, the prolife
platform you could say. Um,

542
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:55,480
and that starts in the womb obviously,
and it ends at natural death. But I, yeah,

543
00:28:55,481 --> 00:28:59,440
I think a lot more people would be more
open minded and more willing to like

544
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:04,510
acknowledge human life in the womb and
see the violence of abortion if they had

545
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:08,320
the conversation. But we just assume
that the other side is wrong, you know,

546
00:29:08,321 --> 00:29:11,200
we assume and, and people, I think when it
comes to prolife, if they're pro choice,

547
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:14,590
they assume that's just what the
crazy Republicans believe, you know?

548
00:29:14,591 --> 00:29:17,600
Or that's what Trump thinks or that's
what Trump is doing. Or you know, they,

549
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:19,270
they don't really,
and then they're afraid.

550
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,730
I think that's the other thing is fear.
People are afraid.

551
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,550
And even what you were saying Dave,
about being moderate on this,

552
00:29:24,551 --> 00:29:27,070
I think there's a sphere of like
women are going to be set back,

553
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:31,450
like mothers are going to be
set back if abortion is illegal,

554
00:29:31,451 --> 00:29:34,290
if abortion is rejected.
Societaly yeah,

555
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:34,600
right.

556
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,850
Well it's always framed as a woman's
right issue or a woman's health issue.

557
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:38,720
Right,
right.

558
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,750
Which is extremely misleading
because I mean the first I,

559
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:46,840
the a key part of the hippocratic
oath on healthcare is do no harm.

560
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,580
And actually the original
hippocratic oath,

561
00:29:48,581 --> 00:29:53,581
which is that all doctors and medical
personnel had to take this oath saying

562
00:29:54,161 --> 00:29:57,910
that they would actually not administer
abortion because abortion is doing harm

563
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,090
to the second patient, to the, to
the child. It's killing that child.

564
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:06,160
So we have to have a paradigm shift on
this and we also have to see that there

565
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:08,980
are risks, there is responsibility
that is involved. I mean,

566
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,470
I'm not saying that any
woman who gets pregnant,

567
00:30:11,471 --> 00:30:14,890
she has to parent that child and be
involved in that child's life for life

568
00:30:14,891 --> 00:30:18,030
because that's, you know, that may be
something that's really difficult for her,

569
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,420
something that she's not able to do,

570
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:22,240
but I think we need to take more
responsibility for each other.

571
00:30:22,241 --> 00:30:23,310
I think that's part of the message.

572
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,470
So then going back to the
question that I asked earlier,

573
00:30:25,471 --> 00:30:29,160
do you think that a sensible thing for
the pro life movement to do that today,

574
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,490
and this is a strange hint that
I might be giving you, would be,

575
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:36,750
would be you focusing
more on what's done after.

576
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,190
So we framed that before within,

577
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,490
whether it's done through the church
or some other private organization,

578
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:46,530
but if the focus was there so that you
can take the pressure off all of the men

579
00:30:46,531 --> 00:30:50,280
and women who, you know, they're
sort of somewhere in the middle,

580
00:30:50,281 --> 00:30:53,130
but they are really concerned that if
you're going to force people to do this,

581
00:30:53,131 --> 00:30:57,000
you're going to bring all these unwanted
pregnancies and all of these things out

582
00:30:57,001 --> 00:31:00,420
there and then you're going to have, or
you're going to have more women, you know,

583
00:31:00,421 --> 00:31:04,110
going to back alleys and all that. So
that, so that if your focus may be,

584
00:31:04,111 --> 00:31:06,840
was there a little bit more maybe,
maybe that would do something.

585
00:31:06,841 --> 00:31:07,770
I'm really just speaking.

586
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:11,840
Yeah, I mean that is the product
movements focus. I mean, again,

587
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,710
this is totally the misrepresentation.
I think of our,

588
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:20,930
of our work and, and at the movements work
to people who disagree. I mean, again,

589
00:31:20,931 --> 00:31:24,950
people who disagree are likely not going
to be getting their news from people

590
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:25,784
who are pro life.

591
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:29,270
People who disagree are going to be
getting their news from organizations like

592
00:31:29,271 --> 00:31:31,570
the New York Times is pro abortion.
I mean the,

593
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,270
The Washington Post editorial
boards or pro abortion,

594
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,140
they explicitly aren't
supportive abortion.

595
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:38,830
Do you know you're not going to get me to
defend mainstream media here right now.

596
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:39,900
You're just giving me red man.

597
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,410
Mine is that you don't know what's
going on in the product movement because

598
00:31:44,411 --> 00:31:45,730
people haven't taken the time to look.

599
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:49,570
The pro life movement has thousands more
than, uh, more than abortion clinics,

600
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,340
thousands of pro bono,

601
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:56,490
confidential pregnancy and early
childhood care support facilities.

602
00:31:57,770 --> 00:32:01,900
You know, places where they provide
prenatal support, they provide ultrasound,

603
00:32:01,901 --> 00:32:04,780
they provide parenting
classes, baby clothes, diapers,

604
00:32:04,781 --> 00:32:07,960
and then when the child is still an infant
that we'll try to help place for jobs.

605
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:09,040
They'll try to do resume work,

606
00:32:09,041 --> 00:32:12,520
they'll do all kinds of amazing things
and there's thousands of pregnancy

607
00:32:12,521 --> 00:32:14,530
centers across the country
that are designed for this.

608
00:32:14,531 --> 00:32:19,360
Then the social safety nets that we do
have in this country are designed for,

609
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,630
for, for young mothers and for
young families as well. Those,

610
00:32:22,631 --> 00:32:26,140
those exist churches that
are doing support, you know,

611
00:32:26,141 --> 00:32:27,440
connected to pregnancy care centers.

612
00:32:27,441 --> 00:32:31,090
So there's a ton of stuff out there like
here in la, there's several of them.

613
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:35,110
And I volunteered at them, you know, when
I was a student. So they're out there,

614
00:32:35,111 --> 00:32:38,650
they're just not getting any press.
Yeah. People just don't know about them.

615
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,230
So about the, so we do care. We care
about where you have to be consistent.

616
00:32:42,231 --> 00:32:44,060
I agree. You're pro life,
you can't just be like,

617
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:47,750
I just love the baby before he or
she is born. We love the baby period.

618
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,370
We love the life period.

619
00:32:49,371 --> 00:32:52,820
And there's work being done for
children both before and after birth.

620
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:57,720
Yeah. So what about the sort of like
nitty gritty legal parts of this?

621
00:32:57,721 --> 00:33:02,670
Cause the, the discussion about abortion
often is just framed through Roe v Wade,

622
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,240
right? So we're, well, I don't
have to ask you where you fall off,

623
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:09,990
where you fall on Roe v Wade, but it
is one of those positions where, again,

624
00:33:09,991 --> 00:33:14,670
and I say this is begrudgingly pro choice
and I hear you and I, and I hear it. I,

625
00:33:14,671 --> 00:33:18,090
I really, I do hear you on these
arguments. I really do. Um,

626
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,400
but as a state's rights guy,
because everyone's, everyone,

627
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,280
a lot of people think that Roe v
Wade was about making abortion legal

628
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,840
[inaudible], which isn't the case. This
was it, that it was federally, right? Uh,

629
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,300
mandated so that,
okay,

630
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:34,020
stripped away states protections the
roadway way basically said you can't ban

631
00:33:34,021 --> 00:33:37,240
abortion in your state. You're not
allowed to abortion as a right. You can,

632
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:41,460
you need to allow abortions. And that's
actually part of the, the, the uh,

633
00:33:41,461 --> 00:33:45,000
women's right in your state. And
look, I mean, you could do this,

634
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:48,030
you could kind of walk back to another
human rights abuse, our country,

635
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:53,130
a profit at both profited
from and perpetuated, which
is slavery. And you know,

636
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:57,630
you had this, this, this situation where
you had some states who saw the, the,

637
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,720
the uh, the person, the slave
as three fifths of a human,

638
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:04,380
literally three fifths of a person. And
then you saw some states who said, no,

639
00:34:04,381 --> 00:34:05,250
these are persons.

640
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:09,750
I don't think states should get to decide
that some humans are persons and other

641
00:34:09,751 --> 00:34:14,220
humans aren't persons. I'm
with everybody's a person.
If you're a human life,

642
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:17,100
you're a person.
Now how we care for you and protect you.

643
00:34:17,101 --> 00:34:20,880
It's going to be complex. That's, that's
a whole other question, but I don't,

644
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,460
I'm about, I'm also for
states' rights. You know,

645
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:24,870
I think we're very big diverse country.

646
00:34:24,871 --> 00:34:28,650
I think localization is important
for laws and for, you know,

647
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:32,460
both was safety nets, you know,
community, how communities are governed.

648
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:37,230
But I don't think that we should get to
decide whether some people live or die.

649
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,610
I mean, that's what it, it's
interesting because this is where,

650
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,250
because we don't have these conversations
and if you don't hear people explain

651
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:44,110
that properly because you hear
a lot of people on the right,

652
00:34:44,111 --> 00:34:46,780
we'll say that they think
it's an overstep, uh,

653
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:51,040
by the court of what the constitution
should be laying out in terms of state's

654
00:34:51,041 --> 00:34:52,450
rights and the individual and all that.

655
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:55,440
You're saying that even though
your first state's rights,

656
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:57,420
that you don't even think
this is a states rights issue?

657
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,190
Yeah. I mean, again, it
all comes back to is he,

658
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:05,360
is he or she or human life and do all
human lives deserve protection? I mean,

659
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:07,340
again,
I know it's hard to be,

660
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:11,600
it's hard to be consistent in that way
because we have these competing concerns,

661
00:35:11,601 --> 00:35:14,120
especially ones that have been
heavily branded and promoted,

662
00:35:14,121 --> 00:35:18,110
like this idea of women's rights, this
idea of choice. I'm for women's rights,

663
00:35:18,111 --> 00:35:19,460
by the way.
I am for choice.

664
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:23,840
I'm for bodily autonomy to the degree
that I'm not interfering with somebody

665
00:35:23,841 --> 00:35:26,420
else's right to live.
But again,

666
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,550
I can't interfere with
somebody else's right to live.

667
00:35:28,551 --> 00:35:31,490
And if I have a child with me,
that is a responsibility.

668
00:35:31,491 --> 00:35:35,150
I do have to a degree at least, and other
people should be helping me with it,

669
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,830
but that doesn't mean I have the
right to end the of that child.

670
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:42,420
Okay, so let's go to just
some other series. The
unpleasant parts of this, when,

671
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:47,450
when we see videos of what an abortion
is like and all of these things,

672
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:52,530
and undercover planned parenthood things
where they talk about, yeah, you know,

673
00:35:52,531 --> 00:35:57,530
throwing body parts into a guard. I mean,
horrible, horrible stuff. Yeah. I just, I,

674
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,930
I guess I want to give you an
opportunity to just address some of that.

675
00:36:00,931 --> 00:36:04,270
Obviously not that shocking to you,
what's going on?

676
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,920
Yeah, well, I've been inside
abortion clinics. I mean,

677
00:36:06,921 --> 00:36:10,790
I've done investigative reporting
and I know people, you know,

678
00:36:10,791 --> 00:36:14,120
obviously David has done
the investigative reporting,

679
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:19,070
exposing the body parts, trafficking,
that happens at abortion facilities. Um,

680
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:23,340
he and I work together, so I'm very
familiar with that really ugly side of it.

681
00:36:23,341 --> 00:36:23,600
Yeah.

682
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,880
So what does that actually mean?

683
00:36:24,881 --> 00:36:29,360
That they're actually aborting fetuses
and then selling the body parts? Yeah,

684
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:33,130
yeah, exactly. I mean, now they would say
we don't make that much money off of him,

685
00:36:33,131 --> 00:36:37,570
so it's not really selling, but they're
making like 70, 80, $90 a body part.

686
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:42,110
And if you've got five body parts, if
you've got a heart, a Le Livre, a brain,

687
00:36:42,111 --> 00:36:46,420
you know, you could be making
400 $500 off of each fetus,

688
00:36:46,421 --> 00:36:51,421
off of each baby and on top of
the 500 or 400 or $600 abortion,

689
00:36:51,481 --> 00:36:55,030
they're talking about a thousand bucks
plus an abortion, then, you know,

690
00:36:55,031 --> 00:36:58,180
all in profit or all in net,
you know, money coming in.

691
00:36:58,181 --> 00:37:02,140
So it is an industry. Um,
the government's funding it,

692
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,590
people don't realize this,
but the National Institute
for Health has a budget.

693
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:10,810
$100 million in the last reported year
goes to research on aborted baby body

694
00:37:13,391 --> 00:37:17,080
parts. So think about that. Like the
government is literally have this,

695
00:37:17,081 --> 00:37:20,380
he has this hundred, you know, 100
million bucks, millions of dollars,

696
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,860
which is for these researchers.
And so they're going to go by,

697
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:27,190
they need their stuff, they need
their body parts. So where do they go?

698
00:37:27,191 --> 00:37:29,980
Abortion facilities. And they're
going to be like, you know,

699
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:33,370
it's profitable for the abortion facility
to do business with the middleman who

700
00:37:33,371 --> 00:37:36,240
then hands it off to the, to
the experiment. You know, the,

701
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,100
the person experimenting on these,
on these children's bodies

702
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,950
where, where does planned
parenthood fit into the equation?

703
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:47,020
So they sell, um, they've sold body parts
and there's continue to sell body parts.

704
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:47,831
In fact,

705
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:51,250
the district attorney here in Orange
County shut down the middle man that was

706
00:37:51,251 --> 00:37:55,960
doing business with planned parenthood
to by body parts from them to then sell

707
00:37:55,961 --> 00:38:00,040
them off to medical experimenters, you
know, who are doing experimentation on,

708
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:03,550
on them. So planned parenthood is one
of, I mean they're the biggest abortion.

709
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:03,791
China,

710
00:38:03,791 --> 00:38:06,130
I mean a lot of people don't know this
about planned parenting cause they were

711
00:38:06,131 --> 00:38:07,210
like planned parenthood,
you know?

712
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:09,600
Yeah. Awesome. They're a hoe. You
always hear people say play. It's,

713
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:12,790
it's less than 1% of their
activities or something like that.

714
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:16,180
Even the Washington Post has given
that three Pinocchios, you know,

715
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,160
like slate has called it very misleading
that they do one, you know, one or 3%.

716
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,790
Um, the fact is planned parenthood
is the biggest abortion providers.

717
00:38:24,791 --> 00:38:27,880
So there they commit over
300,000 abortions annually.

718
00:38:27,881 --> 00:38:30,820
That's almost a third of the
national abortion rate. Um,

719
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:34,030
they're the biggest kind of single
chain that is doing abortions.

720
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:37,900
That's 900 a day.
900 lives taken a day up to 24 weeks.

721
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:40,290
So even past the point you
say, are your, you know,

722
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,830
okay with these are children that are
viable. Um, but all of the abortions are,

723
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:47,920
are wrong or are taking
innocent human lives.

724
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:51,550
And that's a lot of dead bodies that
they could do business with middlemen to

725
00:38:51,551 --> 00:38:55,210
get them off to labs where
they're experimented on.

726
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:58,300
Is there any country in the west that are,

727
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:01,840
that's doing the laws in a better way,

728
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:07,720
a better way of within your estimation.
So Malta, Malta has, you know,

729
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:11,290
really better much talk a little bit
ever been referenced on the show before.

730
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,660
Well, go Malta. You know, I'm also really
prolife and they're very, you know,

731
00:39:16,661 --> 00:39:19,120
no abortion is permitted in the country.
Um,

732
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,960
Ireland was very prolife
until abortion activists,

733
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:27,820
a lot of them imported from the UK and
from other countries when there and said,

734
00:39:27,821 --> 00:39:32,070
no, this is gonna be, we
gotta legalize it. But let's
see, let's just back up this.

735
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,130
So a country like Malta,

736
00:39:33,131 --> 00:39:37,480
are there numbers on how many women are
now actually going to back alleys and,

737
00:39:37,481 --> 00:39:42,400
and what is actually the state doing
after? And that's a great question Dave,

738
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:44,040
because I think that is a,

739
00:39:44,041 --> 00:39:47,470
a fear that motivates like abortion
pro choice people sometimes like,

740
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:50,620
well women are going to go to back alleys.
That's actually a myth.

741
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:53,980
That's actually a myth that
all these women are going
to do back alley abortions.

742
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:58,180
If abortion's illegal before abortion
was illegal, let's legal in this country,

743
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,520
the abortion that suppose,
um,

744
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:03,310
deaths from back alley
abortions were in the hundreds,

745
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:07,360
not the tens of thousands
that were claimed. And the,

746
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:08,860
the reason we know this is first of all,

747
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:13,270
the CDC was reporting in the hundreds
but tens of thousands that were claimed

748
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:16,700
that they said we'll tens of thousands
of women are dying right now. Um,

749
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:19,900
were fabricated numbers and the people
that made up those numbers later on

750
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,740
admitted it.

751
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,790
So Dr. Bernard Nathan said it was
important abortionist he helped found the

752
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:26,890
national abortion rights association.

753
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:31,150
So Ne Rao and he later became a pro
life activists, this guy. And he said,

754
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:34,630
we made up the numbers. We were just
trying to like get our agenda through.

755
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:39,640
So we literally made statistics up out of
thin air. What was it that changed him?

756
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:41,560
I'm sure there's an interesting story.
I mean,

757
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:44,110
there are a lot of things that
changed him, but eventually,

758
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:49,140
cause he's doing all these abortions
and eventually he just saw and you know,

759
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,200
as he was looking at the ultrasound of
what he was doing and the child basically

760
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:58,000
running for his or her life, I mean, from
the section, he just was like, I can't,

761
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,460
this is all of a sudden it
clicked for him. I mean,

762
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,980
it's kind of a mysterious thing.
Why didn't it click before?

763
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:06,250
But it clicked for him and he just
thought, I can't do this anymore.

764
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:10,060
And at the same time he was having his
own faith journey and like believing that

765
00:41:10,061 --> 00:41:13,750
human life is made by a god,
a creator who loves us.

766
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:17,770
And that also was beginning
to move his heart on it. Um,

767
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,450
but so it took them years to kind of have
a full, like, you know, one 80 on it.

768
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,960
But eventually he became, you know,
a pro life activists and said,

769
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:30,310
I was a mass murderer. You know, he wrote
books about his experience and said, I,

770
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,450
you know, I, I took 70,000
lives and shared that fountain.

771
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,320
So we discussed a little bit about the
belief part and you mentioned that there

772
00:41:39,321 --> 00:41:43,010
are nonbelievers that are prolife
you really never hear about that.

773
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:46,880
Do you find that they have different
issues that they're thinking about or

774
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:50,210
struggling with or meaning if you're
not have a religious background? Yeah,

775
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,373
cause yeah,

776
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:55,100
the general picture of someone that's
prolife is usually just like a Christian

777
00:41:55,101 --> 00:41:57,560
conservative. I mean that's just,
yeah, that's generally what it is.

778
00:41:57,561 --> 00:42:02,561
You don't find that many or you just
don't see publicly that many atheist or

779
00:42:02,571 --> 00:42:05,300
just more secular prolife people.

780
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:08,940
Yeah. Well first of all, I
wasn't always identify as,

781
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,860
I didn't always identify as a Christian,
you know,

782
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:14,430
when I was like in high school and as a
teenager I actually ended up becoming a

783
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:15,480
Catholic in college.

784
00:42:15,481 --> 00:42:19,350
But it was after my own journey of
discovering what I believed and whether I

785
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:22,260
knew for sure what religion
identified with, if at all.

786
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:26,490
I knew that it was wrong to intentionally
taken innocent human life. So I think,

787
00:42:26,491 --> 00:42:28,580
again, if it goes back
to the, the, the, the,

788
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,950
the facts of this and it goes back
to the, you know, being consistent.

789
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:35,430
It doesn't matter your worldview, it
doesn't matter your religious background.

790
00:42:35,431 --> 00:42:37,170
It doesn't even matter
your political affiliation.

791
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,560
Nothing matters except do
you believe human life is,

792
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,660
it should not be intentionally killed,

793
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:47,610
innocent human life and is the child in
the womb is this innocent human life. Um,

794
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,600
but that being said,

795
00:42:48,601 --> 00:42:52,740
I think there is a growing amount of
people even in the pro life movement who

796
00:42:52,741 --> 00:42:57,600
don't identify with a religion, who
are, you know, atheists, I know these,

797
00:42:57,601 --> 00:43:01,580
some of them, firstly atheists
or, um, part of, uh, you know,

798
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:06,620
very left leaning causes other causes
who are pro life and see it from a

799
00:43:07,261 --> 00:43:11,610
scientific and logical perspective and
from a human rights perspective. Um,

800
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,070
but there are a lot of, obviously
people of faith who are pro life.

801
00:43:14,071 --> 00:43:16,820
I wish there were more
just because you know,

802
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,890
there are people of faith who are out
there being Christian and they're not

803
00:43:19,891 --> 00:43:23,060
doing anything about pro, you
know, abortion there, you know,

804
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:24,710
this is the greatest human rights issue.
The,

805
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,200
there are thousands of children
being killed every day and,

806
00:43:27,201 --> 00:43:30,180
and women facing an unexpected
pregnancy at churches.

807
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,250
And it's not talked
about enough in churches.

808
00:43:32,251 --> 00:43:35,310
So just because you're a Christian or
conservative doesn't mean you've got it

809
00:43:35,311 --> 00:43:36,570
all figured out.
You know,

810
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:38,380
have you found,
um,

811
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,430
counterparts on the pro choice side
of this that are willing to have this

812
00:43:42,431 --> 00:43:45,370
discussion? Because originally when,
when I think you reached out to us,

813
00:43:45,371 --> 00:43:47,920
or maybe it was on Twitter at first
about coming on the show, I thought,

814
00:43:47,921 --> 00:43:49,630
all right,
well I should do this one as a debate.

815
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:52,420
And then I thought about it a little bit
longer and I thought, you know what? No,

816
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:57,100
let's, let's do one just with you so we
can hear your ideas without it, you know,

817
00:43:57,101 --> 00:43:58,480
without the entering the fray.

818
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,500
And then I'll find somebody who it will
be a lot easier to find someone on on

819
00:44:02,501 --> 00:44:04,600
that side. Right. Um, and do that.

820
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:07,570
And then maybe we'll do this as a debate
then or a conversation or something.

821
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:08,590
Yeah.

822
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:11,830
And I'd be happy to do it but I wanted
to do it separately first just so that

823
00:44:11,831 --> 00:44:12,880
all the ideas can be out there.

824
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:17,830
Do you find that you can find people on
the pro choice side of this that will

825
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:21,580
debate you in this? In an honest and even
way, because I don't have to tell you,

826
00:44:21,581 --> 00:44:25,990
I'm finding it harder and harder to find
people broadly on the left that will do

827
00:44:25,991 --> 00:44:29,020
these types of debates without attacking
you personally and your motives.

828
00:44:29,021 --> 00:44:32,010
And that's really hard things about it.
It's really hard,

829
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:34,530
Dave, to find people willing
to debate about this.

830
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:39,180
I have been on shows like radio shows,
TV shows,

831
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:43,830
and planned parenthood has been invited
and every time they've declined like

832
00:44:43,831 --> 00:44:46,020
planned parenthood spokespeople
or representatives.

833
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:48,660
And I was actually on a live radio show.

834
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:52,140
It was somewhere in the Midwest and
the planned parenthood director of that

835
00:44:52,141 --> 00:44:55,710
Midwest affiliate was on the
other line like she had been,

836
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,330
she had been invited and when she heard
my voice and she heard that who I was

837
00:45:00,331 --> 00:45:03,320
like as a pro life activists and she
heard me talking, she literally hang,

838
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:06,960
hung up like she, she ditched out
of this, you know, ditch the show.

839
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:11,150
So I have seen in the pro abortion world,
um,

840
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,440
I call it pro abortion because
I don't think, again there's,

841
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:16,770
there is middle ground on this,
but in that pro choice world I've,

842
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,800
it's very hard to find people
willing to have the debate,

843
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:24,830
especially on live TV or in a longer
you a format where it's filmed or people

844
00:45:25,291 --> 00:45:26,110
can watch it later.

845
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:30,370
Yeah. It's so interesting because that I
just find so consistent with everything

846
00:45:30,371 --> 00:45:33,160
that's happening on the left
these days on every issue.

847
00:45:33,161 --> 00:45:34,690
If you want to talk about climate change,

848
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:37,630
they won't talk about it cause you
have to accept their position first or

849
00:45:37,631 --> 00:45:38,201
whatever.
And again,

850
00:45:38,201 --> 00:45:41,740
I say that I say that as someone that's
not fully where you are obviously,

851
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:44,950
but like I'm finding it more difficult
and more difficult than their stake.

852
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:47,950
They're in an odd way,
they're staking out religious position.

853
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:51,340
Yeah. It's a, it's interesting. It's
like, it's the new pharisees, you know,

854
00:45:51,341 --> 00:45:56,200
it's like, I'm so holy, I'm so right.
I'm not even gonna deal with your dirty,

855
00:45:56,201 --> 00:45:59,830
you know, people that don't just don't
agree with me and like, you know, I'm,

856
00:45:59,831 --> 00:46:02,110
I'm the one who's pure.
I'm the one who's compassionate.

857
00:46:02,111 --> 00:46:04,300
I'm the one who's correct.
And yeah,

858
00:46:04,301 --> 00:46:08,260
it's really vicious and it's
really bad for everybody, you know.

859
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:11,620
What do you think the pro life community
generally thinks of Trump at this point?

860
00:46:11,621 --> 00:46:13,780
I mean,
he's probably in a weird way,

861
00:46:13,781 --> 00:46:18,580
been the biggest supporter for you
guys in modern times at some level,

862
00:46:18,581 --> 00:46:19,100
right?

863
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:23,440
Yeah. I mean, he has been very
supportive and in many ways, um,

864
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,720
I was very skeptical when
he ran for office. Um,

865
00:46:26,721 --> 00:46:31,160
I did not vote for him in the primary.
Um, and I was really concerned.

866
00:46:31,161 --> 00:46:34,160
I thought he was potentially
just kind of tricking.

867
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:36,140
All of us are trying to trick people.
You know,

868
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:39,470
even when he had my pants come on as the
VP because of Penn's a super pro life

869
00:46:39,471 --> 00:46:43,400
and he has been consistently politically
for years. Um, I was encouraged by that,

870
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:47,570
but I was also like, is
this like your token prolife
pence, you know, on a ticket.

871
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:50,360
But he has eve ministration has
done some very prolife things,

872
00:46:50,361 --> 00:46:54,380
which I'm really grateful for.
I find it really sad though that,

873
00:46:55,190 --> 00:46:58,730
you know, the, the one that's most
prolife as far as the policy is concerned,

874
00:46:58,731 --> 00:47:01,280
you know, he, he did it, he
reversed the Mexico City policy,

875
00:47:01,281 --> 00:47:05,130
which is international funding for
abortion. He um, defunded planned. Yeah.

876
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:07,480
Let's talk about that one for a second.
Cause that was actually,

877
00:47:07,481 --> 00:47:10,550
I think one of the first things that he
did and it sort of went under the radar

878
00:47:10,551 --> 00:47:13,300
and, and then I saw these people
arguing about it and it's like,

879
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:17,560
so we were actually funding
abortions overseas, not overseas,

880
00:47:17,561 --> 00:47:21,070
but in Mexico over, over,
not beyond our borders.

881
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:24,850
For some reason we were using
American tax dollars to do that.

882
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,450
Do we even know why? Why was that
policy even in place in the first place,

883
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:31,180
that that has nothing to do with
whether you're pro choice or pro life.

884
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,270
That's just like,
why are we funding abortions anywhere?

885
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:36,130
Why are we funding these types
of things outside of work?

886
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:40,520
Yeah, I mean a population control is a
lot of it and that is rooted in Eugenics.

887
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:43,400
So early you,
Dennis s in this country,

888
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:45,770
we're also Margaret
Sanger and her friends,

889
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:48,080
she founded planned parenthood
and they wanted to use,

890
00:47:48,081 --> 00:47:52,010
they used for sterilization,
like she promoted for
sterilization. Margaret Sanger,

891
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,480
who is the founder of planned parenthood.

892
00:47:53,481 --> 00:47:57,320
She actually designed
the one child policy.

893
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,590
She wrote out a proposal for a
one child policy. If you were,

894
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:02,840
apparently you're not allowed
to have more than one child,

895
00:48:02,841 --> 00:48:05,180
the state would force you
to only have one offspring.

896
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:07,220
And that's what China's doing right now.
I mean,

897
00:48:07,221 --> 00:48:10,070
they've kind of expanded it to maybe
the two child policy, but it's,

898
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:11,360
it's really horrific.

899
00:48:11,361 --> 00:48:14,750
I mean it's this idea that the
government gets to decide what happens in

900
00:48:14,751 --> 00:48:17,660
reproduction.
So it's the whole thing about pro choice.

901
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:21,110
It's actually the opposite of it. It's
like, so not choice that you are not,

902
00:48:21,111 --> 00:48:22,280
you're forced abortion,

903
00:48:22,281 --> 00:48:25,490
forced sterilization and if
somebody's developing nations.

904
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,280
I know the stories and these
are anecdotal so we don't,

905
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:32,150
it's hard to even know the full body of
research on this or no what is actually

906
00:48:32,151 --> 00:48:32,810
going on,

907
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:37,810
but I have anecdotal stories of women
who went to family planning clinics in

908
00:48:38,511 --> 00:48:42,830
Mexico or family planning clinics in some
African nations that are UN operated,

909
00:48:42,831 --> 00:48:43,664
funded by us,

910
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,300
have been in the past month by us tax
dollars and they were without their

911
00:48:47,301 --> 00:48:51,560
consent or knowledge we're given IUD
is placed in them that they then didn't

912
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:53,540
know how to deal with. I
mean they would, you know,

913
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:56,660
years later this one woman had migraines
yet had all these health conditions.

914
00:48:56,661 --> 00:48:57,680
You didn't know what was wrong with her.

915
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:01,100
Finally they discovered this old IUD
in here that have been there in her for

916
00:49:01,101 --> 00:49:03,950
like 15 years and with potentially
it could be life threatening.

917
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,700
So there's all kinds of weird
stuff happening where the rich,

918
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:11,520
right. I suppose that depends how far you
want to go down the rabbit hole of what

919
00:49:11,521 --> 00:49:14,750
these, the ritual eat may be in
you and are doing about, yeah.

920
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:17,560
They're like looking at impoverished
countries and they're thinking, hmm,

921
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:20,260
what are we going to do with impoverished
countries or countries that are

922
00:49:20,261 --> 00:49:23,020
struggling? Let's have them make
sure they have less children.

923
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:27,250
Like why not better education,
access to clean water,

924
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:30,400
better infrastructure, less,
you know, better democracies.

925
00:49:30,430 --> 00:49:34,330
Why don't we just going to try to kill
off or limit their ability to have

926
00:49:34,331 --> 00:49:36,400
children?
I mean it's,

927
00:49:36,401 --> 00:49:41,200
it's a really a terrible
approached at a very, very,

928
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,230
I think in many ways it's
racist and it's, and it's, it's,

929
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:47,860
it's of discriminatory just because
people are poor against them, right?

930
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,600
Because you're poor,
you shouldn't have children.

931
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,700
Right. It's one of
those things, I mean to,

932
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,820
to be funding these
things beyond our borders,

933
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:56,790
the United State for remove the unit,
you end for a second, but to, you know,

934
00:49:56,791 --> 00:49:59,510
for the United States to be doing it,
it's such a strange thing.

935
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,500
Then our, our borders. I mean, well,

936
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:03,810
whether you,
whether you're for it or not,

937
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,650
doing something within
your borders is one thing.

938
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:07,120
Doing something outside of your borders.

939
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:09,190
Yeah. I mean it's our, it's
our, I think, you know,

940
00:50:09,191 --> 00:50:11,770
where they were going to go save the
world. America is going to save the world.

941
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,350
Yeah.
America can do good in the world for sure.

942
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:18,280
But you're not saving the world by going
off and helping other people kill their

943
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:20,920
offspring. I mean, that's just not good.

944
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:24,690
So what is the funding situation? So,
yeah, so I, I you hear a lot about this,

945
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:29,240
about how much we either give
a tax dollars for abortions
and planned parenthood

946
00:50:29,241 --> 00:50:30,021
or they'll say no,

947
00:50:30,021 --> 00:50:34,400
it's 99% private are extremely
confusing information that,

948
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,650
that again, it's one of these things,
it depends who you follow on Twitter to,

949
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:41,050
to basically decide what you
think on this. So what is,

950
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,020
what do we need to know about fun?

951
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:46,290
Yeah. So here are the basic
numbers. And again, I, I'll,

952
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:50,110
I'll explain what the opposing side
may say. So for, for, you know,

953
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,510
maybe show where the disconnect is,

954
00:50:52,511 --> 00:50:57,250
but there's over half of $1 billion
being going to planned parenthood from

955
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:59,590
taxpayer us tax payer sources.

956
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,880
So that's federal money and it's shifting,
you know,

957
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:06,070
going down through the states being
distributed through title, title 10,

958
00:51:06,071 --> 00:51:09,280
historically that's what president
Trump just cut actually, um,

959
00:51:09,310 --> 00:51:12,820
his administration and through Medicaid
largely there's all these other teeny

960
00:51:12,821 --> 00:51:15,190
little pockets dreams, you know,
the streams of money as well.

961
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,470
So planned parenthood
says, well, we're not,

962
00:51:17,471 --> 00:51:20,680
they're not funding our abortion because
we're using this to reimburse for

963
00:51:20,681 --> 00:51:25,670
ultrasound or reimburse for condoms
are reimbursed for, you know, um,

964
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,370
a pregnancy test or whatever.

965
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:32,200
The problem with that is those
reimbursements are helping fund the

966
00:51:32,201 --> 00:51:35,500
infrastructure at planned parenthood where
they're committing abortions and some

967
00:51:35,501 --> 00:51:40,501
of those other services like ultrasound
or pregnancy tests are done around the

968
00:51:41,081 --> 00:51:42,430
abortion service.

969
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:44,150
No,
it was like the precursor base.

970
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:46,480
Yeah. And it's just the money's
fungible. Like, you know,

971
00:51:46,481 --> 00:51:51,390
it's kind of like saying like,
we're not going to fund the funds steak,

972
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,560
you know,
people eating steak because it's wrong.

973
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,990
It's eating cows is wrong or you know, or
turning the environment whenever. Right,

974
00:51:56,991 --> 00:51:59,110
right. Um, and so we're not, we're,

975
00:51:59,111 --> 00:52:02,050
but we're still gonna fund steakhouses
half of a billion dollars a year.

976
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:05,890
It's like, well, it's only paying for the
ketchup and the French fries and like,

977
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,070
you know, it's just like,
come on guys like that.

978
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:12,160
It is funding a corporation
that has increased abortion
numbers over the last 10

979
00:52:12,161 --> 00:52:15,380
years and a lot of their other
services have actually declined. Okay.

980
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:19,000
Is there any other funding that the
u s provides that outside of planned

981
00:52:19,001 --> 00:52:19,780
parenthood?

982
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:22,450
You mean to abortion
provider? Yeah, not typically,

983
00:52:22,451 --> 00:52:26,110
unless they find ways to reimburse for
similar things at planned parenthood is

984
00:52:26,111 --> 00:52:29,520
doing. So there's, there is a
Hyde amendment where in some,

985
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,290
I actually take that back because
in some states like California,

986
00:52:32,291 --> 00:52:35,320
you can reimburse directly from abortion.
So that's the state money.

987
00:52:35,470 --> 00:52:38,890
So we're just talking federal money
this half of a billion dollars. Um,

988
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,250
so planned parenthood, if you went to
a planned parenthood in California,

989
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:45,220
if you qualify,
you could reimburse for an abortion,

990
00:52:45,221 --> 00:52:49,300
even a late term abortion in our state and
other states. Um, so that's, uh, that's,

991
00:52:49,301 --> 00:52:49,670
uh,

992
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:53,260
a big chunk of money and it's hard to
even track that money because every state

993
00:52:53,350 --> 00:52:55,750
tracks it differently. But, but yeah,

994
00:52:55,751 --> 00:52:58,870
I think the fact that they're funding the
infrastructure for planned parenthood,

995
00:52:58,871 --> 00:53:01,450
they're funding the ability
for it to market itself,

996
00:53:01,451 --> 00:53:05,290
build relationships in communities. Um,
you know, put the, turn the lights on,

997
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:08,800
hire the staff. It all helps them
increase their abortion business.

998
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:13,480
Do you know that numbers are the
specifics on like states that, right.

999
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,400
So I get your position on Roe v Wade.

1000
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,720
I would assume a state like Mississippi
still probably has the tightest laws

1001
00:53:19,721 --> 00:53:23,800
around when you can have an abortion
versus a state that I suppose like

1002
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:26,880
California, that probably the most
lenient and I'm just picking those two,

1003
00:53:26,881 --> 00:53:29,910
but I'm guessing I'm not that far
off. Yeah, there are gravity is right.

1004
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:33,050
Like for example,
Ohio recently passed the heartbeat bill,

1005
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:37,280
which would try to ban abortions
once the heartbeat can be detected.

1006
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,480
The problem is,
yes,

1007
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,440
usually.
When is that?

1008
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:44,130
That's it. Just three, you know, three
weeks basically 21 days. Amazing.

1009
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,070
I'll quickly like it. Most women don't
know they're pregnant at that point. They,

1010
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:47,630
they,

1011
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:51,180
they like don't even have even necessarily
missed her period yet or they might

1012
00:53:51,181 --> 00:53:54,660
just start to be missing
it. Um, so anyways, yeah,

1013
00:53:54,661 --> 00:53:59,520
I think there are states that are trying
to ban abortions like past the first

1014
00:53:59,521 --> 00:54:01,200
trimester in the first trimester,

1015
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:05,520
but they're being hit with challenges
because that's where row kicks in,

1016
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:09,450
you know, row says and row and dough
dough, which are two different cases.

1017
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:10,980
And then Casey v Planned parenthood,

1018
00:54:11,310 --> 00:54:15,000
these different illegal precedents
after Roe that basically say if you're a

1019
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:15,331
state,

1020
00:54:15,331 --> 00:54:18,780
it's really hard for you to ban or
nearly impossible for you to ban abortion

1021
00:54:18,781 --> 00:54:22,680
after, you know, before
viability. Um, or if you prefer,

1022
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:25,950
do you mind for them that then the
discrepancy is when is viability? Right,

1023
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,610
right. And that meant, you know,

1024
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:31,460
medical advancements have pushed it
further and further back. You know,

1025
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:34,180
a child can survive at
21 and a half weeks.

1026
00:54:34,181 --> 00:54:36,700
It's incredible of who
was born completely.

1027
00:54:36,701 --> 00:54:40,510
Primi and that may continue to push back.
But again, it's so arbitrary. It's like,

1028
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:44,020
why does that define whether or not
you should live or die? You know,

1029
00:54:44,021 --> 00:54:46,750
how advanced medical technology is,
whether or not you can be killed or not.

1030
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:49,510
So you would argue that
then this law in Ohio,

1031
00:54:49,511 --> 00:54:52,890
the heartbeat lies basically you would
say that's a good first step or something.

1032
00:54:52,891 --> 00:54:53,180
Yeah.

1033
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,920
Yeah. We, we celebrate
any of any laws like that.

1034
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:00,180
And there are some states which are also
trying to limit abortion by making it,

1035
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:03,930
making abortion facilities have
to have standards like hospitals.

1036
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:08,670
So that's another thing that is made some
progress. And what standards does that,

1037
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:13,480
for example, ambulatory hallway,
so you're able to fit your, uh,

1038
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:14,640
you know, I, I, um,

1039
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,910
a stretcher through the hallway so
that if there's a woman who starts

1040
00:55:17,911 --> 00:55:20,910
hemorrhaging, which has happened, you
know, happens sometimes with abortion,

1041
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:23,420
she can be carried on a structure,
um,

1042
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:27,020
or the doctor has to have visiting
privileges, uh, in nearby hospitals.

1043
00:55:27,021 --> 00:55:28,980
So if she goes to the
emergency room afterwards,

1044
00:55:28,981 --> 00:55:31,830
I mean I just knew a friend who recently
had to go to the emergency room, um,

1045
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:37,190
who had an had an abortion and you need
to have the doctor be able to accompany

1046
00:55:37,711 --> 00:55:41,580
you or know who your doctor is, have
admitting privileges. But again,

1047
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:45,210
abortion advocates are
against all of these things.

1048
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:49,170
They think abortion facilities basically
should have as few regulations.

1049
00:55:49,171 --> 00:55:53,940
That's like a dental clinic or even less
actually like a tanning. So on, you know,

1050
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,220
because again, it's this
idea, this ideology,

1051
00:55:56,221 --> 00:56:00,270
this is a women's rights don't
interfere whatsoever. And you know that

1052
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:01,151
probably what state,

1053
00:56:01,151 --> 00:56:04,960
what state is the most lenient if
Ohio is sort of doing it right.

1054
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:09,480
In your estimation, what stay would you
say is sort of the most out there? Okay.

1055
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,350
Well,
New Mexico's really out there.

1056
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,810
It's abortion through all
nine months for any reason.

1057
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:18,970
So that really is real. So you, that means
that you can have a perfectly healthy,

1058
00:56:18,971 --> 00:56:20,330
yeah,
eight months.

1059
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,710
Yeah. Fetus. Yes.

1060
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:28,720
And you don't have to have a medical
excuse. You don't have to have a, yeah,

1061
00:56:28,721 --> 00:56:32,470
I mean I, yeah, I mean this
is where I just, I can't,
and I got nothing left there,

1062
00:56:32,471 --> 00:56:33,304
right.
Like,

1063
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,260
yeah. I mean it's happening. People
don't even know when New York. Huh.

1064
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:40,570
Are there numbers on
how often that happened?

1065
00:56:40,571 --> 00:56:44,720
Say after it's really hard after that,
20 weeks or something like that. Yeah.

1066
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:47,120
It's really hard to track.
We know it's in the tens of thousands,

1067
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:50,950
but it's hard to know exactly.
You know,

1068
00:56:50,951 --> 00:56:54,130
cause it's some of the state reporting
that California doesn't report to the CDC

1069
00:56:54,131 --> 00:56:58,180
how many abortions it does or how late
term they are. So the national numbers,

1070
00:56:58,181 --> 00:57:00,670
I mean we know tens of thousands,
but we don't know. Beyond that,

1071
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,590
we don't know what else is
happening in some of these dates.

1072
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,920
What New York did is already
being done in seven other states,

1073
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:10,060
abortion through nine months. But we
just, again, people just don't know.

1074
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:11,610
Media is not reporting on it.

1075
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:14,100
Wait, so the New York thing, which
just happened and there's a very,

1076
00:57:14,101 --> 00:57:16,140
I thought it was a very chilling video.
I mean,

1077
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:18,300
I tweeted it even though I
wasn't thrilled to do it,

1078
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:23,330
of all of the state legislator legislature
of cheering this bill so that that

1079
00:57:23,971 --> 00:57:26,770
bill allowed it under any
circumstances to nine months

1080
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:28,500
in New York. They said, well,

1081
00:57:28,501 --> 00:57:33,501
if there's a health or what could be
emotional health or mental health reason,

1082
00:57:33,511 --> 00:57:36,420
economic reason that the
mother and the doctor decides.

1083
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:40,330
So that's really saying if for any reason,
because if I go in and say,

1084
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:43,830
we know I'm not feeling like doing this
because I just think it's not convenient

1085
00:57:43,831 --> 00:57:46,620
for my life right now. Um, it's
not good for my life right now.

1086
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,230
And you got the abortion as a
sign off on it, which, you know,

1087
00:57:49,231 --> 00:57:53,280
they're making up to $20,000 for a late
term abortion, then you're good to go.

1088
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:54,390
Okay

1089
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:57,830
man. It's unbelievable. And
then they had the, the uh,

1090
00:57:57,870 --> 00:57:59,040
statute and that statue of Liberty,

1091
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:03,060
the empire state building is in pink or
something because we're all trade the

1092
00:58:03,061 --> 00:58:06,180
new world trade building built
it. It was lit up and pink. Yeah.

1093
00:58:06,181 --> 00:58:08,700
To celebrate the late term
abortion passage. I mean,

1094
00:58:08,701 --> 00:58:10,800
this is where I say it's
like they're making my,

1095
00:58:12,150 --> 00:58:15,570
what I would again say is a pretty
moderate yeah, decision and you know,

1096
00:58:15,571 --> 00:58:18,750
you're saying they're 21 weeks now
because science has advanced that a,

1097
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:23,550
that a fetus could be, uh, you know, uh,
livable, right? Then it's like, all right,

1098
00:58:23,551 --> 00:58:26,490
well I'm talking about the 20
week pain thing and if I that had,

1099
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,800
I could probably,
if we did this long enough,

1100
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:31,500
you could get me to move forward on
that and that they will know, well,

1101
00:58:31,501 --> 00:58:33,390
let's say it's 16 weeks.
And again,

1102
00:58:33,391 --> 00:58:36,730
I'm conceding that because that was the
exact conversation I had with Ben when

1103
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:39,870
he said, well, if it's at 18 weeks
and I can't, I can't deny that.

1104
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,880
But then when they take
such an extreme position,

1105
00:58:41,881 --> 00:58:44,910
and I think this is what's happening all
over the political landscape right now,

1106
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,000
we have sides taking stress,
extreme positions all over the place.

1107
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,360
So we get pulled in ways that
maybe aren't the default.

1108
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:53,360
I places for us that's true about

1109
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:56,720
policy decisions, like how do we
deal with environmental concerns?

1110
00:58:56,721 --> 00:58:59,570
How do we deal with health care?
How do we deal with tax palsy?

1111
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:01,870
What do we do about the poor?
What do we do about homeless?

1112
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:04,160
It's like there's so many,
what do we do about education?

1113
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:09,260
You can have extreme policy positions,
but with prolife it's not about policy.

1114
00:59:09,261 --> 00:59:10,580
It's about fundamentals.

1115
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:14,780
It's about do human beings have the
right to live and does the state,

1116
00:59:14,781 --> 00:59:17,750
is it the state's duty to do
their best to protect them,

1117
00:59:17,751 --> 00:59:21,520
even if it's a complex situation. Because
in a situation where you know there's,

1118
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:25,400
for example, a child abuse, right? If
a family is abusing their children,

1119
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,860
the state isn't inspecting every home
to see if your child abuse is happening.

1120
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:32,750
Right? So similarly, if
we made abortion illegal,

1121
00:59:32,751 --> 00:59:35,230
it's not like the state's going to be
inspecting every pregnancy. They're there.

1122
00:59:35,231 --> 00:59:36,560
We'll have to,
we'll have to deal with it.

1123
00:59:36,561 --> 00:59:38,630
We'll have to deal with
that complex situation.

1124
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:42,920
But it comes back to are we
about protecting human rights,

1125
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:45,830
the right to life or not?
And that's why with prolife,

1126
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:48,980
I don't really see it as
one extreme versus another.

1127
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:52,610
I actually see the Democrats position
right now of abortion through all nine

1128
00:59:52,611 --> 00:59:54,080
months as the logical,

1129
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:59,150
consistent argument coming from this
idea that human life in the womb does not

1130
00:59:59,151 --> 01:00:02,090
have value,
does not have legal rights.

1131
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:04,690
Right? So you're really giving the devil
his due there. You're saying, all right,

1132
01:00:04,750 --> 01:00:08,580
this is what you guys want and
this actually all makes sense.

1133
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:11,220
Doesn't have legal protection at 19 weeks.

1134
01:00:11,221 --> 01:00:13,080
Why should it have legal protection at 20?

1135
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,970
All right, so one more for you and then
I promise you we will do this. If I,

1136
01:00:16,971 --> 01:00:20,050
if I can get someone that will have this
conversation in good faith, we will,

1137
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:22,730
we will absolutely do it. And
I welcome people to, you know,

1138
01:00:22,731 --> 01:00:25,760
give us some recommendations
in the comments below. Um,

1139
01:00:25,970 --> 01:00:28,670
what kind of costs is this
ad for you to just do this?

1140
01:00:28,671 --> 01:00:31,940
This is not the type of thing that you're
going to get invited to the parties at

1141
01:00:31,941 --> 01:00:34,580
Berkeley and the cool parties
in la and everything else.

1142
01:00:34,581 --> 01:00:38,200
Just putting yourself out there
on something. The, I, you know, I,

1143
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:41,120
I know about getting hate online.
What does this cost you?

1144
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:44,980
Yeah, I mean, I've gotten my share of
hate online over the years and you know,

1145
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:50,400
death threats and weird attacks and
stockers and just very, you know,

1146
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:54,580
fake porn websites set up about me and
just very weird things over the last 10

1147
01:00:54,581 --> 01:00:59,200
years doing this activism and doing
reporting on this. Um, but you know,

1148
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,020
it all kind of, I put it all in
perspective because I think, look,

1149
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:07,200
we live in one of the freest and most
prosperous nations despite these horrible

1150
01:01:07,571 --> 01:01:10,960
blights that we're struggling with.
Like with, in the past it was slavery.

1151
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,400
In the past it was,
you know,

1152
01:01:12,401 --> 01:01:16,150
women not even having equal rights under
the wise men. And now we have abortion.

1153
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:19,720
So we are dealing with are crap. We
have, we have this stuff to deal with,

1154
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:24,680
but I feel very privileged. And so
when I do experience attacks, I put it,

1155
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:27,370
it helps me to put it in
perspective, you know? Um,

1156
01:01:27,371 --> 01:01:31,630
and then also just the incredible reward
of seeing lives being saved. I mean,

1157
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:35,590
I've been privileged to see lives being
saved because of the work that we do.

1158
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:39,220
Like women who learned the facts and
they'll say, I could never do this.

1159
01:01:39,221 --> 01:01:40,360
I've just not going to have an abortion.

1160
01:01:40,361 --> 01:01:44,620
I'm canceling my appointment and we get
pictures of like the newborn and you

1161
01:01:44,621 --> 01:01:46,600
don't understood, or were you just
like third graders start crying?

1162
01:01:46,601 --> 01:01:49,390
Like thank you know, thankful,
thank goodness that this happened.

1163
01:01:49,391 --> 01:01:50,650
Like thank God this happened.

1164
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:54,130
So it's incredibly rewarding because
we're dealing with life and death,

1165
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:59,290
but so it's extremely painful because
we're dealing with really horrific

1166
01:01:59,291 --> 01:02:00,124
violence,

1167
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:04,810
but we're also seeing lives
be born and live and thrive.

1168
01:02:04,811 --> 01:02:05,920
And that's what it's all about.

1169
01:02:06,470 --> 01:02:08,170
So this is what it's all about for me.
I mean,

1170
01:02:08,171 --> 01:02:11,650
this is exactly why I do this show and
I'm thrilled that you came in here and

1171
01:02:11,651 --> 01:02:16,000
we'll continue this conversation.
And, uh, for more, I Laila,

1172
01:02:16,001 --> 01:02:19,330
you can follow her on
Twitter at Lila Grace Rose

1173
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:23,520
[inaudible]

1174
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:23,950
okay.
