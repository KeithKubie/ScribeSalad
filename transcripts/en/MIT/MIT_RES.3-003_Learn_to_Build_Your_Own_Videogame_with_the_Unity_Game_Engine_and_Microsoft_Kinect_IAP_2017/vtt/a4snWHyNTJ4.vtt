00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.220
KYLE KEANE: So now you're going
to either just cluster shyly

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.870
with the people
that are near you,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.350
or stand up, and look across
the room, and be like,

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.430
is anybody else trying to make
eye-contact with other people?

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.128
And then like, ah, there you go.

00:00:30.128 --> 00:00:31.810
And then walk over
and be like, hi,

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.060
do you want to work together--

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.530
And then sit down and work it.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.240
So be friendly with
sharing your chairs.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.420
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:02.070
And then one of you pulls up
the Roll-a-ball video tutorial.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.990
MARK: This page?

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.459
KYLE KEANE: Yeah.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.260
And then one or
multiple of of you

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.904
have your computer
out with Unity

00:01:08.904 --> 00:01:11.880
open, and start
playing the tutorial,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.610
and pause it, and
be extroverted.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.970
Be like, hey, can we
pause it real quick

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.630
so I can look up that function?

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.200
Or I would like to try do
this other crazy thing.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.510
Is it OK if I do that?

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.960
Ask for things that you want.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.640
If you have a weird impulse
to try to do something,

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.550
ask If you're asking
too many questions

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.620
and your teammate is
annoyed, then they

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.895
can get up and go
to another team.

00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:37.260
Because I'm telling
you, you should

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.770
be asking questions in here.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.910
And you should be interacting.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.820
So-- and if you happen
to be really quiet,

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.810
and you find a
really quiet group

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.910
that just watches the video
straight through and never

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:48.450
talks, fine.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.420
I'm not going to
force anybody to talk.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.590
But feel free to talk.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.910
Talking is good.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.360
So this is very self-organized.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.050
And you are free
to do as you wish.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.840
I'm going to go check
on the Arduino class

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.500
and make sure that
chaos hasn't broken out.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.350
And then I will be back
in about 20 minutes.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.870
And I'll probably see you all
clustered around the room.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.746
Feel free to go grab
chairs if you need them.

00:02:17.746 --> 00:02:18.661
MARK: Rearrange desks?

00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:20.210
KYLE KEANE: Yeah,
rearrange desks us.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.790
If you want to take
somebody's desk,

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.180
then ask them if you
can use their desk

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.010
so you can be close to the group
that you made eye-contact with.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.370
You guys are good.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.370
MARK: Also, quick
recommendation.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.340
At some point, you're going
to encounter the video up top.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.990
And then a script
is down below so you

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.820
can more clearly read it.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.950
I would highly recommend
not just copying this

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.330
into the Unity Editor.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.590
It will work.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.130
But by typing it out, you
get a much better idea

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.460
of what you're doing, especially
if you're following it

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.101
in real time, rather than
just Control-C, Control-V.

00:02:58.101 --> 00:03:00.100
KYLE KEANE: So if you
feel rushed in your group,

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.140
then be like, hey,
Kyle said you should--

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.098
that we take our time--

00:03:05.098 --> 00:03:08.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.620
And speak up a little bit.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.300
And take your time
typing it out.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.320
If you're like, why
are there freaking

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.520
periods between every word?

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.260
Ask your group.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.330
And if nobody understands,
then ask another group.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.660
Because that's a
super valid question.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.275
There's a lot of meaning in why
there's periods between words

00:03:25.275 --> 00:03:27.901
and why there's round brackets
rather than square brackets.

00:03:27.901 --> 00:03:29.650
And if you have weird
questions like that,

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.165
you're asking the
right question.

00:03:31.165 --> 00:03:31.790
Ask your group.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.975
If they don't
know, then it's not

00:03:33.975 --> 00:03:36.350
your fault for asking a question
that was hard to answer.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.210
It's everyone else's
responsibility

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.900
to find the information
to answer that question.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.260
So you can try Mark or I. I
don't have all the answers.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.040
Or you can try another group.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.740
Inter-group dialogue is
the coolest thing ever.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.470
So if you guys get there
today, I'll be very impressed.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.650
But usually it takes a few
days before people really

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.420
get extra prudent.

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.470
MARK: Yeah-- hopefully, at
some point, when you guys get

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.760
to this line of code, it's
kind of a weird concept,

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.356
and you should ask.

00:04:09.356 --> 00:04:10.380
KYLE KEANE: Yes.

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:13.370
So there are points where
you should be confused.

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.740
All right, so
free-wheeling chaos.

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.579
Let chaos reign for a minute.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.850
Find people and
make eye contact.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.510
Smile, that helps.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.610
It signals to other humans
that you're friendly.
