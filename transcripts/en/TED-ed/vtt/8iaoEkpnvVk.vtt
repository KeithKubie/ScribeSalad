00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.039
If you live on the east coast
of the United States,

00:00:09.063 --> 00:00:11.490
you've spent the last
17 years of your life

00:00:11.514 --> 00:00:13.286
walking, eating and sleeping

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.856
above a dormant army of insects.

00:00:16.434 --> 00:00:18.228
These are the cicadas.

00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:20.033
Every 17 years,

00:00:20.057 --> 00:00:23.205
billions of them emerge
from the ground to do three things:

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:24.979
molt, mate and die.

00:00:25.655 --> 00:00:28.351
There are 15 different broods
of cicadas out there,

00:00:28.375 --> 00:00:30.580
grouped by when they'll emerge
from the ground.

00:00:30.604 --> 00:00:32.683
Some of these broods
are on a 13-year cycle,

00:00:32.707 --> 00:00:34.338
others are on a 17-year clock.

00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:37.714
Either way, the cicadas live underground
for most of their lives,

00:00:37.738 --> 00:00:39.506
feeding on the juices of plant roots.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.728
When it's time to emerge,

00:00:40.752 --> 00:00:43.299
the adults begin to burrow
their way out of the ground

00:00:43.323 --> 00:00:44.474
and up to the surface,

00:00:44.498 --> 00:00:46.439
where they'll live for just a few weeks.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:47.757
During these weeks, though,

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:49.907
everybody will know
the cicadas have arrived.

00:00:49.931 --> 00:00:51.412
There will be billions of them.

00:00:51.436 --> 00:00:52.642
And they're loud.

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.381
Male cicadas band together
to call for female mates,

00:00:55.405 --> 00:00:58.592
and their collective chorus
can reach up to 100 decibels --

00:00:58.616 --> 00:00:59.854
as loud as a chain saw.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.306
In fact, if you happen to be using
a chain saw or a lawn mower,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.881
male cicadas will flock to you,

00:01:04.905 --> 00:01:06.683
thinking that you're one of them.

00:01:07.183 --> 00:01:08.809
Now, like most things in nature,

00:01:08.833 --> 00:01:10.833
the cicadas don't arrive without a posse.

00:01:10.857 --> 00:01:13.852
There are all sort of awesome
and gross predators and parasites

00:01:13.876 --> 00:01:15.892
that come along with the buzzing bugs.

00:01:15.916 --> 00:01:18.154
Take the fungus Massospora for example.

00:01:18.178 --> 00:01:21.120
This little white fungus buries itself
in the cicada's abdomen

00:01:21.144 --> 00:01:22.364
and eats the bug alive,

00:01:22.388 --> 00:01:23.856
leaving behind its spores.

00:01:24.272 --> 00:01:25.672
When those spores rupture,

00:01:25.696 --> 00:01:27.804
they burst out of the still-alive cicada,

00:01:27.828 --> 00:01:30.224
turning the bug into a flying
saltshaker of death,

00:01:30.248 --> 00:01:34.007
raining spores down upon
its unsuspecting cicada neighbors.

00:01:34.031 --> 00:01:35.666
But while we know pretty precisely

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.934
when the cicadas will arrive
and fade away,

00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:40.717
we're still not totally certain of why.

00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:42.076
There are certain advantages

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.723
to having your entire species
emerge at once, of course.

00:01:44.747 --> 00:01:47.194
The sheer number of cicadas
coming out of the ground

00:01:47.218 --> 00:01:50.120
is so overwhelming to predators,
it is essentially guaranteed

00:01:50.144 --> 00:01:52.429
that a few bugs will survive
and reproduce.

00:01:52.453 --> 00:01:55.496
And since cicadas emerge
every 13 or 17 years,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.952
longer than the lifespan
of many of their predators,

00:01:57.976 --> 00:02:01.275
the animals that eat them don't learn
to depend on their availability.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:02.647
But why 13 and 17 years,

00:02:02.671 --> 00:02:05.028
instead of 16 or 18 or 12?

00:02:05.615 --> 00:02:07.718
Well, that part no one really knows.

00:02:07.742 --> 00:02:10.076
It's possible the number
just happened by chance,

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.495
or, perhaps, cicadas
really love prime numbers.

00:02:12.976 --> 00:02:15.474
Eventually, the cicadas
will mate and slowly die off,

00:02:15.498 --> 00:02:17.412
their call fading into the distance.

00:02:17.436 --> 00:02:19.563
The eggs they lay
will begin the cycle again,

00:02:19.587 --> 00:02:22.872
their cicada babies burrowing
into the earth, feeding on plant juice,

00:02:22.896 --> 00:02:25.055
and waiting for their turn
to darken the skies

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.714
and fill the air with their songs.

00:02:26.738 --> 00:02:28.530
In 17 years, they'll be ready.

00:02:28.944 --> 00:02:30.094
Will you?
