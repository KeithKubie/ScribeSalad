00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.150
So using the information from my mitochondrial chromosome

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.470
the SNVs we can trace my maternal line.

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.340
&gt;&gt; Exactly. you got your mitochondrial DNA from your

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.710
mother, she got it from her mother. And she

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:14.020
got it from her mother and so on and

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.100
so let's take a look at your mitochondrial DNA.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.850
&gt;&gt; Okay. Alight, and what I'd like to do now, is focus on

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.980
the maternal line. So let's go back up to the menu, My Results.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:24.090
&gt;&gt; 'Kay.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.980
&gt;&gt; And under Ancestry Overview,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.500
we see Maternal Line, which is what we've been talking about. and then.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.610
&gt;&gt; Oh, wow. So I have my maternal line from J2A1A

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.740
And what does that mean exactly? So if you remember when

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:43.880
we looked at the rest of your chromosomes they indicated a

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.104
lot of ancestry from Britain and Ireland. And J2 is a

00:00:47.104 --> 00:00:48.305
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:48.305 --> 00:00:50.470
It's also very common in Europe and different parts

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.755
in Europe. and it's a lineage that arrived in

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:59.430
Europe maybe 45,000 years ago. So that's something that

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.710
you inherited from your mother. So, if you were

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.430
to trace back you, you know, and get to

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.190
know who you're relatives were through your maternal line.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.700
You'd find that they all, that they, you probably

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.810
were living in Europe, different parts of Europe. And maybe

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.310
if you went far enough back, if you

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.070
went 45,000 years you'd probably find that they

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.600
were on the Arabian peninsula, in the Near

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.010
East. and if you went even further back, you'd

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.495
find that they were in Africa. Because if we, all of us, when we trace our

00:01:27.495 --> 00:01:30.040
ancestry, a single lineage of our ancestry far

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.220
enough back, we'll find that it traces to Africa.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.500
&gt;&gt; Now interestingly, I actually have my, my own father is in the 23andMe.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.000
&gt;&gt; Aha. Okay.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.810
&gt;&gt; Group 2, and I notice that he and I have the same mitochondrial subgroup.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:44.010
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.090
&gt;&gt; Now, does that mean we're related?

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.250
&gt;&gt; That means that you have a common maternal ancestor.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.320
And it could be back, you know, thousands of years.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.800
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.900
&gt;&gt; yeah. But that's kind of cool, you know?

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.321
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:55.321 --> 00:01:57.020
&gt;&gt; To share that maternal ancestry. It's not,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.540
you did not inherit it from him. But

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.680
both of you have a maternal ancestor, if

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.790
you go back far enough, the same maternal ancestor.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.910
&gt;&gt; And now,

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.480
what about Roy King, who we looked about earlier?

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.009
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.570
&gt;&gt;

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.060
&gt;&gt; Let's find, so.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.800
&gt;&gt; Roy is.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.410
&gt;&gt; Roy has a lineage called L2C, and that lineage is

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.800
very common in Western Africa. And if we recall Roy's overall ancestry

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.580
chromosomes 1 to 22. about half of it traced back to Africa.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.950
But what we see by looking at his maternal line is that,

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.440
specifically, If he goes back the mothers, you know?

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.690
his mother's mother's mother's mother's mother came from Africa. and

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.510
what I'd like to do is compare that with

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.080
his paternal line, I mean when I get a chance.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.650
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.800
&gt;&gt; Okay.
