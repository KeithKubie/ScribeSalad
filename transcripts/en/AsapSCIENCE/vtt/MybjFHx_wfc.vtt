00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.810
You hear about the IQ’s of famous people,

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.860
but how is intelligence measured, and how do you stack up?

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.200
One of the most common tests involves identifying
emotions in people’s faces.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.599
For example, what is this expression?

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:19.699
Do you think it's embarrassment, sadness, amusement, or shame?

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.490
If you guessed embarrassment you are correct!

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.560
This test is used to help measure your ability
to empathize and communicate effectively with others.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.760
So let’s look at a more ubiquitous test
for intelligence - the IQ Test, also known

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.020
as the Intelligence Quotient.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.820
It is a standardized test that assesses both
verbal and non-verbal abilities.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.660
Study this geometrical pattern sequence right now.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.890
Now of these 6 tiles below, which tile would you
choose to complete the pattern?

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.560
I'll give you a couple of seconds, but pause the video if you need more time.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.100
If you picked 5, you're correct!

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.860
Basically, each row has a diamond, a square and a triangle

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.500
as well as a solid bar, a
lined bar and an empty bar.

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.979
Since this bottom row has a triangle and diamond,
we know the next one's a square, and it also has a

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.820
lined and an empty bar, so we know we need a solid bar.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.509
The direction of the bar is also the same
in each line.

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:20.170
Though IQ tests are common, other ways to
test if you are smart do exist.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.340
There is now a prominent theory of ‘Multiple
Intelligences’, such as musical-rhythmic intelligence.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.440
Let’s test your pitch!

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.240
Which of these songs sounds ‘off’ to you?

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.080
Song one?

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.560
Song two?

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.460
or song three?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.880
If you guessed clip 3, you have a good sense
of pitch.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.179
Though not fully understood, you could be
tone deaf and still have perfect hearing but

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.540
how your brain interprets the sounds may make
it difficult to interpret pitch.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.940
Now, what about your visual intelligence?

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.120
I’m going to show you a picture of these
six shapes for 10 seconds.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:15.620
Try to remember them as best
as you can!

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.359
Ok now which of these three did you already
see?

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.180
If you guessed ‘C’ you are correct!

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.680
This task needed to use ziggerins’s - novel
objects that don’t exist in real life in

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.070
order to accurately test you.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.040
If you are good at the ziggerin task you may
have higher visual intelligence which is not

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.220
the same as IQ.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.989
But it could mean that you will excel at tasks
like matching fingerprints, interpreting medical

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.709
X-rays, or keeping track of aircraft on radar
displays.

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.931
Not all intelligences can be measured, for
example bodily-kinesthetic intelligence, the

00:02:49.931 --> 00:02:54.030
capacity to handle objects skillfully is difficult
to tease apart.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.860
A study of 4 year olds at a ballet class couldn’t
assess rhythm effectively because some had

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.510
already taken classes before or dance at home
creating predisposed knowledge.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.060
As well many tests require a combination of
many types of intelligences, so it’s hard

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.299
to study just one.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.540
What this research underscores is that there
are so many ways to be smart, and it is not

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.560
just about taking an IQ test.
