00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.310
So, I'm going to update the utility of s by looking at the utilities of

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.360
all the other states, including itself, as prime. And weight those based on my

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.760
probability of getting there given that I took an action. And what action am

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.610
I going to take? Well, I'm going to take

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.120
the one that maximizes my, expected utility.

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.550
&gt;&gt; So it's sort of like figuring out what to do in a state assuming that this

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.330
uhat really is the right answer for the future.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.780
&gt;&gt; Right. Now why is that going to work? So

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.550
I just made up the uhats, right? They started

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.900
out as arbitary utilities. The next little step about

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.910
updating utilities based on neighbors makes some sense because effectively

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.600
is any state that you can reach. Which is

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.830
determined by the transition function. But, all I'm doing

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.510
is reaching states that are also made up of

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.110
arbitrary utilities so, arbitrary values. Why should that help me?

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.800
Well, it's because of this value right here. This

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.630
is actual truth. The actual word I get for entering

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.830
into a stage, is a true value. So, effectively

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.319
what's going to happen is I'm going to be propagating out the

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.460
true value, or true reward, the true immediate reward

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.970
that I get for entering into a state, say. Through

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.900
all of the states that I'm going to see and

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.060
propagating that information back and forth. Until ultimately I converge.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.410
&gt;&gt; Still

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.520
not obvious why we should converge, because

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.500
we start off with an arbitrary function and

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.970
it seems like that could be really wrong. So we're like adding truth to wrong.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.320
&gt;&gt; Yes but then, the next time

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.276
around I'm going to, I've been adding truth twice

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:33.930
to wrong, and then more truth to wrong, and more truth to wrong. And eventually,

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.380
I'm going to be adding, more and more and more and more and more and more

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.210
and more and more and more and more

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.990
truth, then it will overwhelm the original wrong.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.910
&gt;&gt; And is that, does it help that the

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.090
wrong is being discounted?

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.290
&gt;&gt; Yes, it helps that the wrong is being discounted.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.040
Does it help that the wrong is being discounted? I actually

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.720
don't know that matters. I'll have to think about that for

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.000
a moment. It certainly doesn't hurt. But I, I guess the

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.390
way that I think about this, I mean there's an

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.950
actual proof you can look it up but in the end

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.290
I think, I, I tend to think of this as a

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.980
kind of simple contraction proof that effectively at every step you

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.000
have to be moving towards the answer. Because you've added in more

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.560
of the reality, more of the truth. And if you remember the

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.110
utility of a state is just all of the rewards that you're

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.520
going to see. So, basically at every time step you have added the reward

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.740
that you're going to see, and then all of the rewards you're going to

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.830
see after that. And so you've gotten a better estimate of actually the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.520
sequence of rewards you're likely to see from the state. And if

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.340
that gets better for any of the states, then eventually that betterness will

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.310
propagate out to all the other states that they can

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.230
reach or can reach them. That will keep happening and you'll

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.330
keep getting closer and closer and closer for the true

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.780
utility of the states until you eventually run out of closeness.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.370
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.850
&gt;&gt; Does that make sense at all?

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.390
&gt;&gt; Well does it also help that the gamma is less than one.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah it does. the, the way I like to think of this

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.340
as, is as a sort of contraction proof, that makes, if you've heard

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.390
of those. So, the basic idea here is that you

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.490
start out with some noise, but at every step, you're

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.160
getting some truth, and that truth gets added, and then,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.580
the next dideration, more truth gets added, and more truth

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.230
get, gets added. So, as you have some estimate of

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.760
some particular state S, you get to update it based

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.300
on truth. It's actual reward. And you bring in more

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.580
truth from the other utilities, as well. As this particular utility

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.000
gets better. That closeness to the true utility then

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.450
gets spread to all, from, to all the states

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.980
that can reach it. And because the gamma is

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.270
less than one. You basically get to overwhelm the past

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.980
in this case which is the original arbitrary utilities.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.760
And so as you keep iterating through this, the latest

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.705
truth becomes more important than the past less truth.

00:03:45.705 --> 00:03:47.810
And so you are always getting closer and closer and

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.760
closer to the truth until you eventually you do. At

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.300
least that's the intuition that I like to think of.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah I, I kind of get that as an

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.510
intuition, though I'd probably be happier going through the math, but.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.910
&gt;&gt; Well, we could do that, and by we, I

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.520
mean the students can do that by actually reading the proof.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.620
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:12.950
&gt;&gt; Okay, so cool. So, this right here is a an easy way to find the true value

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:16.070
of states. And you do it by iterating and it kind of has a name.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.430
&gt;&gt; It kind of has a name.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah, what do you think the name could be?

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.459
&gt;&gt; Bellman. Bellman's algorithm.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.460
&gt;&gt; No. No though that's probably reasonable.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.520
&gt;&gt; Utility iteration.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.020
&gt;&gt; Yes, except utility sounds better if you say value,

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.180
so it's value iteration. And it works. Remarkably well. So,

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.060
and it doesn't, doesn't give you the answer but it

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.090
gets you something that is closer and closer to the answer.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.740
&gt;&gt; Right. And, eventually it will converge. You'll

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.630
get so close to converging it doesn't matter.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.950
And, once you have the two utilities, if you recall. We

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.400
know how to define the optimal policy in terms of utilities. So,

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.990
if I give you the utilities, then the optimum policy is

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.670
just, well I'm in a state. Look at all the states I

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.090
might get to. Figure out the expectation that I'm going to get

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.850
for a given action. Pick whichever one is maximum and I'm done.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.360
So solving for the utilities are the true value of a

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.350
state. Is effectively the same thing as solving for the optimal policy.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.230
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.090
&gt;&gt; Excellent.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.430
&gt;&gt; That's cool.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.240
&gt;&gt; I think so.
