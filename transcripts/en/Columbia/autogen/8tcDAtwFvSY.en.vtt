interesting the last several years not
 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.660
interesting the last several years not
only because they're really small these

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670
only because they're really small these
 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.400

nanometers and it's really hard to to

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
nanometers and it's really hard to to
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.620
nanometers and it's really hard to to
really see how small these are without

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:00.630
really see how small these are without
 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.600
really see how small these are without
looking at that but you have to look at

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610
looking at that but you have to look at
 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.889
looking at that but you have to look at
the microscope to really appreciate that

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899
the microscope to really appreciate that
 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.490
the microscope to really appreciate that
but also these men of these metal

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500
but also these men of these metal
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.710

plasma on resonance so what happens is

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
plasma on resonance so what happens is
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.480
plasma on resonance so what happens is
when you hit a metal nanoparticle with

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490
when you hit a metal nanoparticle with
 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.429

enhancements follow the light and that

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:35.249
enhancements follow the light and that
 

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:37.580
enhancements follow the light and that
leads to really strong scattering and

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590
leads to really strong scattering and
 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.499
leads to really strong scattering and
absorption of light which allows us to

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509
absorption of light which allows us to
 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.940

easy mathematical considerations that is

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299
easy mathematical considerations that is
 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.000
easy mathematical considerations that is
only allowed an interface so an

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010
only allowed an interface so an
 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.580
only allowed an interface so an
interface between two different media

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590
interface between two different media
 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.899
