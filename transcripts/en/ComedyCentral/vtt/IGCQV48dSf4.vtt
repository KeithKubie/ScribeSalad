00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:43.243
(Ari)
Ladies and gentlemen,
a very funny woman.

00:00:43.277 --> 00:00:46.079
Ms. Iliza Shlesinger, everybody.
Let her hear it.

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:50.717
[cheers and applause]

00:00:50.751 --> 00:00:51.752
Because I fly so much,

00:00:51.785 --> 00:00:53.554
I have a rule, and that is:

00:00:53.587 --> 00:00:56.256
never talk to the person sitting
next to you on an airplane.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.025
This rule instated after

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.594
I shared a lovely hour-long
flight to San Jose with a woman

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.496
who just pretty much spent
the whole time telling me

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:05.332
why Jews are the source of
all the problems in the world.

00:01:05.365 --> 00:01:07.100
So...
[exhales]

00:01:07.134 --> 00:01:09.436
So I never talk to
the people sitting next to me.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.538
And I was flying home
about a year ago

00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:13.774
and a boy sat next to me.

00:01:13.807 --> 00:01:15.609
He was about my age, clean cut.

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:17.611
He started chatting,
and he seemed normal.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:19.046
So, I asked him about himself.

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.380
I'm like,
"Tell me about yourself."

00:01:20.414 --> 00:01:21.849
He's like,
"Well, my name is Brian.

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:23.851
I work at a hedge fund
and I went to Yale."

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:25.552
I was like, "Okay, nerd alert."

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:27.054
[chuckles]

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:28.856
And he was like,
"Tell me about yourself."

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:30.624
I was like, "My name's Iliza,
I'm a standup comedian,

00:01:30.657 --> 00:01:35.562
and I struggle with being
attractive, yet accessible."

00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:38.899
So, over the next couple weeks
we kind of became friends.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.534
We stayed in touch.
We'd hang out a lot.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.469
And I liked him.
I liked his personality.

00:01:42.503 --> 00:01:43.704
He was a hard worker,

00:01:43.737 --> 00:01:45.939
Irish American,
hard worker, smart.

00:01:45.973 --> 00:01:47.708
And it became clear
that he had a crush on me.

00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:49.009
He would always try
to buy me drinks,

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:50.677
always buy things to impress me.

00:01:50.711 --> 00:01:51.712
He bought a house at one point.

00:01:51.745 --> 00:01:53.780
Not for me, but he bought one.

00:01:53.814 --> 00:01:55.115
I never went over,
'cause I didn't want to,

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:56.783
you know,
see him with his shirt off

00:01:56.817 --> 00:02:00.654
'cause I could tell that
his body was unacceptable.

00:02:00.687 --> 00:02:03.690
And I think it bothered him that
I didn't have a crush on him.

00:02:03.724 --> 00:02:04.958
And I was like,
let me explain it to you.

00:02:04.992 --> 00:02:07.027
I am a seven without makeup,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.130
and you are a four with money.

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:12.165
Those are the numbers,
crunch them as you will.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.001
So, one day
he called me and he was like,

00:02:14.034 --> 00:02:17.137
"We can't hang out today.

00:02:17.171 --> 00:02:20.574
My mother has been
diagnosed with cancer."

00:02:20.607 --> 00:02:22.576
I stopped dead in my tracks
and for some reason,

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.077
something in my heart opened up

00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:25.412
and all I wanted to do
was take care of him.

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:26.880
This is a man
that had done nothing

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:28.248
but be kind to me,
and be sweet to me.

00:02:28.282 --> 00:02:30.017
So, I was like,
"What do you want to do?

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.518
"Can I take you somewhere?
Can I take your mom somewhere?

00:02:31.552 --> 00:02:32.920
"You want to cry?
I'm crying right now.

00:02:32.953 --> 00:02:33.921
"That's a weird
chemical imbalance,

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:35.155
but I feel bad for you."

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:36.356
I just wanted to
be there for him.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.658
And over the next
couple of weeks,

00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:40.093
I started to
fall in love with him.

00:02:40.127 --> 00:02:42.262
And we dated for about a week
and things were great.

00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:44.264
And then things got weird.

00:02:44.298 --> 00:02:46.166
My mom called me one day.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.101
[hoarse voice, New York accent]
"Eliza.

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:50.437
I Googled your boyfriend."

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.575
Incidentally, my mother
is Selma, from The Simpsons.

00:02:54.608 --> 00:02:57.110
[applause]

00:02:57.144 --> 00:02:59.780
"And on his company bio,
it doesn't say he went to Yale.

00:02:59.813 --> 00:03:01.348
It says University of Ohio."

00:03:01.381 --> 00:03:03.917
Fine institution,
but it ain't Yale.

00:03:03.951 --> 00:03:04.952
So, I called my boyfriend.
I was like,

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:06.253
"Why doesn't it say Yale?

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:07.287
"You talk about Yale
all the time.

00:03:07.321 --> 00:03:08.689
"You seem pretty proud of it.

00:03:08.722 --> 00:03:10.190
Why doesn't it say it
on your bio?"

00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:11.758
He was like, "Oh, my God.
If you saw the way

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:13.293
"things were run
at this company, it's a mess.

00:03:13.327 --> 00:03:14.628
It's a nightmare.
I'm leaving anyway."

00:03:14.661 --> 00:03:15.863
And I was like, "Totally.
I got it.

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:17.531
[Bleep] the man, yeah,
I got it."

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:19.266
People mess up my bio
all the time.

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.134
Sometimes they don't put winner
of Last Comic Standing.

00:03:21.168 --> 00:03:23.003
Sometimes they put winner
of America's Next Top Model.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:25.939
Do I correct it?
No.

00:03:25.973 --> 00:03:27.207
I just let audiences be
disappointed

00:03:27.241 --> 00:03:28.675
with my lack of facial symmetry.

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.544
Whatever.

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:31.945
I was like, "All right, well,
I'm gonna make you

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.347
"some cupcakes.
I'm gonna bring them

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.115
"to your house.
I haven't seen it yet.

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:36.683
This is gonna be fun."
He's like, "Well, bring them

00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:37.985
to my office."
I was like, "No, I'll bring them

00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:38.986
"to your house.
Your office is on the,

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:41.755
ugh, West Side."
So...

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:44.224
He gives me the address, and as
I'm driving toward his house,

00:03:44.258 --> 00:03:45.959
I'm noticing
it's not in Beverly Hills,

00:03:45.993 --> 00:03:47.427
which is where he said
he bought a house.

00:03:47.461 --> 00:03:49.196
It's in Hollywood.
And as I pull up,

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.265
I notice it's not so much
a house as it is a duplex.

00:03:51.298 --> 00:03:53.033
So, thinking
I've made a mistake,

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.135
I go up to the window
and I look in.

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.870
Looking for context clues.

00:03:56.904 --> 00:03:58.872
Looking for some things of his,
Yale context clues, right?

00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:02.142
Plaid, mallards, pennants,
minorities chained to a window,

00:04:02.176 --> 00:04:04.945
something.

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:06.480
And none of that was in there.

00:04:06.513 --> 00:04:08.482
And before I could leave,
a girl opened the door.

00:04:08.515 --> 00:04:10.317
And we locked eyes and she goes,

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.985
"You're Iliza."

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.287
I was like, "Who are you?"
She goes, "I'm Mary.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.454
I'm Brian's roommate."

00:04:14.488 --> 00:04:16.490
I was like, "Hm."

00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:17.658
So I call my boyfriend.

00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:19.226
And I was like,
"What's up, bro?

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.795
What's up with the roommate
and non-house?"

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:23.630
He was like, "Um, okay.

00:04:23.664 --> 00:04:26.767
"This is weird,
but I have a house.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.404
"Um, my mom lives in it while
she undergoes cancer treatment.

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:33.340
"And I don't bother her because
we don't really get along

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:34.675
and I want to give her
her space."

00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:37.177
And I was like,
"I totally get that.

00:04:37.211 --> 00:04:39.246
But I need to know
where you [bleep] live."

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.215
So, he comes over and he goes,

00:04:41.248 --> 00:04:43.550
"Here's my address.
Here's my mom's phone number.

00:04:43.584 --> 00:04:44.985
"You have everything.

00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:46.854
"I just ask that you respect--

00:04:46.887 --> 00:04:48.922
basically a woman's dying wish
it to be left alone."

00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:50.724
And I was like, "Fine, double
dog dare me not to be crazy.

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:53.393
I'll take that bet.
Fine."

00:04:53.427 --> 00:04:55.195
So, a couple weeks go by,
I let it lie.

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:56.997
I'm on my way to the airport
to fly to a gig

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.732
and my mother calls me.

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:01.201
[hoarsely]
"Eliza.

00:05:01.235 --> 00:05:03.537
"I called
the Yale registrar's office.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.205
"They have no record
of your Brian

00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:07.174
ever having attended Yale."

00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:08.742
So my first thought is,

00:05:08.775 --> 00:05:11.545
"Maybe they misspelled Brian
over there at Yale.

00:05:11.578 --> 00:05:13.113
"Maybe they wrote Brain.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.449
Maybe they made a mistake
and he did go there."

00:05:15.482 --> 00:05:16.884
So I hang up.
I call my boyfriend.

00:05:16.917 --> 00:05:18.252
And on my way to calling him,

00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:19.920
it's ringing
and I decide to take out

00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:21.355
that piece of paper
that had his address on it.

00:05:21.388 --> 00:05:22.856
The one I was told
to stay away from.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.691
And I drive by that house
in Beverly Hills.

00:05:24.725 --> 00:05:26.894
And I'm about to get out
and knock on the door

00:05:26.927 --> 00:05:28.795
or something just to bother
his mom for a second,

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:31.131
and I see a black family
come out with their kids,

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:32.766
load them into the van.

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:35.102
Now, Brian is Irish,
but he wasn't black Irish.

00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:37.871
So, I call him.

00:05:37.905 --> 00:05:40.040
He picks up and I was like, "You
are lying about many things.

00:05:40.073 --> 00:05:41.708
"I don't know what they are,
but I'm not signing up

00:05:41.742 --> 00:05:43.477
for the next round of this.
I'm out of here."

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.845
And that's when
it all came crashing down.

00:05:44.878 --> 00:05:46.046
He said,

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:47.347
"I can't do this anymore.

00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:48.982
"Um...

00:05:49.016 --> 00:05:50.684
"I didn't go to Yale.

00:05:50.717 --> 00:05:53.220
"And I never bought a house.

00:05:53.253 --> 00:05:55.622
"I just said it to impress you.

00:05:55.656 --> 00:05:57.491
"Also...

00:05:57.524 --> 00:05:59.826
My mother doesn't have cancer."

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.628
Right?
You've never been more annoyed

00:06:01.662 --> 00:06:03.463
that someone
doesn't have cancer.

00:06:03.497 --> 00:06:04.965
So, for the last six or--

00:06:04.998 --> 00:06:09.203
[laughter]

00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:11.004
For the last
six or seven months,

00:06:11.038 --> 00:06:12.673
I've really wrestled with this.
It's a traumatic thing,

00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:15.075
and I've really tried to
figure out a spiritual meaning.

00:06:15.108 --> 00:06:17.544
Some sort of life lesson
I can extrapolate from this

00:06:17.578 --> 00:06:19.580
and use in a healthy way
for the rest of my life.

00:06:19.613 --> 00:06:22.649
And after all is said and done,
the life lesson I've learned is,

00:06:22.683 --> 00:06:24.418
um...

00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:28.055
Never talk to the person sitting
next to you on an airplane.

00:06:28.088 --> 00:06:29.423
Actually,
if we have time for this,

00:06:29.456 --> 00:06:31.058
I think I've also taught
a life lesson.

00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:32.726
And that is, if you're gonna
mess with someone

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.261
because you're a crazy person,

00:06:34.294 --> 00:06:35.829
try not messing
with a standup comedian

00:06:35.863 --> 00:06:38.232
who has access to
a national television show.

00:06:38.265 --> 00:06:40.267
Go [bleep] yourself,
Brian [bleep].

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.268
Thank you.

00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:44.638
[cheers and applause]
