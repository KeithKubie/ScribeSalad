00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.468
Opposers this can't wait
any longer.

00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:04.370
Last week unarmed 22 year old

00:00:04.403 --> 00:00:07.140
Stephon Clark was fatally
shot by police

00:00:07.173 --> 00:00:09.609
20 times in his
grandparents' backyard.

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.010
And yesterday the White House

00:00:11.043 --> 00:00:15.515
spoke ... about why
they're not speaking.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:18.317
This is something
that is a local matter.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.919
It should be left up
to the local authorities,

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:21.888
not something for the federal
government to weigh into.

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:24.157
Yes a local issue.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.860
Just look at all
of these local issues

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:30.196
which are all
the fatal police shootings

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:34.700
since Ferguson. Just a bunch
of totally unrelated small town

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:38.137
and big city and medium village
happenstances.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.372
Actually it's kind of
like this morning

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.374
I found a mouse in my kitchen.

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:43.476
It's not a big deal.
Granted yesterday

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:44.844
I also found one
in my living room

00:00:45.377 --> 00:00:46.646
and in my bedroom, and my shoes,

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.748
and actually also ... my living
room.

00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:51.484
But whose are all single
isolated mice

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:54.520
with single isolated presence,
they left on my pillowcase.

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:56.556
Now my house doesn't
have a mouse problem.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.458
If it were a big house
wide issue

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:01.027
I would probably have to think
of a systematic way

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.628
to address it on a larger scale,

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:04.464
but luckily it's not.

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.733
Look, President Trump
doesn't have time to deal

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:09.602
with local issues.

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:12.172
He focuses on larger stories
that affect the nation.

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:14.841
Like calling Roseanne
to congratulate her

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:16.642
on her spectacular ratings.

00:01:16.675 --> 00:01:17.877
Congratulations Roseanne.

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:21.347
The fight continues. Good.

00:01:21.881 --> 00:01:24.283
You hid down here where
the real truth lies.

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:25.818
