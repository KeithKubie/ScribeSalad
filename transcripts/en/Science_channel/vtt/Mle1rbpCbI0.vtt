Narrator: IN THE WORLD OF

00:00:04.701 --> 00:00:06.234
INTERNET SCIENCE WIZARD
BRUSSPUP,

00:00:06.234 --> 00:00:08.767
NOTHING IS QUITE WHAT IT SEEMS,

00:00:08.767 --> 00:00:10.267
LIKE THIS RULER...

00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:15.467
♪♪

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:19.133
...AND THIS KNIFE.

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:22.033
WE'RE ONE STEP CLOSER
TO AN INVISIBILITY CLOAK.

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:24.400
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE CLIPS

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.400
BECAUSE THE PHYSICS IS SO SMART.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.968
Narrator: BRUSSPUP'S
INVISIBILITY DEVICE

00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:32.868
CONFOUNDED
1 MILLION VIEWERS ONLINE.

00:00:32.868 --> 00:00:34.767
BUT HOW DOES IT WORK?

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:37.667
NORMALLY, WE SEE THINGS
BECAUSE THEY EITHER EMIT LIGHT,

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:39.734
LIKE MY SMILE,

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:43.300
OR THEY REFLECT LIGHT,
LIKE MY SMILE.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.767
IN THIS CASE, NEITHER OF
THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING.

00:00:46.767 --> 00:00:51.100
WHAT BRUSSPUP HAS DONE
IS USED A SET OF LENSES

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.968
SO THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN PLACES

00:00:52.968 --> 00:00:54.934
HE CAN HOLD OBJECTS

00:00:54.934 --> 00:00:56.667
SO THAT THE LIGHT REFLECTED

00:00:56.667 --> 00:00:59.534
FROM THEM NEVER
REACHES THE CAMERA.

00:00:59.534 --> 00:01:03.667
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,
THE LIGHT FROM BEHIND THE OBJECT

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:05.200
DOES REACH THE CAMERA.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.834
AND IT GIVES THE ILLUSION

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:10.868
OF THAT OBJECT
HAVING DISAPPEARED.

00:01:10.868 --> 00:01:13.734
Narrator: SO HOW DID BRUSSPUP
PULL THIS OFF?

00:01:13.734 --> 00:01:16.534
IN BRUSSPUP'S SETUP,
HE HAS FOUR LENSES AND A CAMERA.

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:19.100
Woman: THE LIGHT FROM THE
BACKGROUND ENTERS THE FIRST LENS

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.534
AND GETS FLIPPED UPSIDE DOWN.

00:01:21.534 --> 00:01:24.000
IT'S SENT FROM THE SECOND LENS
TO THE THIRD LENS.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.067
AND BETWEEN THE THIRD
AND FOURTH LENS,

00:01:26.067 --> 00:01:30.501
IT'S FOCUSED DOWN ONTO A POINT
AND FLIPPED UPSIDE DOWN AGAIN.

00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:33.133
BY THE TIME IT COMES
OUT OF THE FOURTH LENS,

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.701
IT'S NO LONGER DISTORTED.

00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:36.834
IT LOOKS EXACTLY AS IT SHOULD DO

00:01:36.834 --> 00:01:39.400
IF THERE WEREN'T
ANY LENSES IN BETWEEN.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.067
THE AREA BETWEEN THE LENSES

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:42.934
BUT OUTSIDE THE BEAM OF LIGHT

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:45.200
IS KNOWN AS THE CLOAKING REGION.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.868
AND THIS IS BECAUSE ANY LIGHT

00:01:46.868 --> 00:01:48.868
THAT ENTERS THE LAST LENS
FROM THIS REGION

00:01:48.868 --> 00:01:50.901
DOES NOT MAKE IT TO THE CAMERA.

00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:53.734
AND IT'S THOSE POINTS
HE CAN PUT IN A KNIFE,

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:56.267
HIS HAND, A LASER.

00:01:56.267 --> 00:01:58.467
AND THEY WILL DISAPPEAR.
