00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.499
Ten signs a psychopath is targeting you

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.159
Psychopaths are very dangerous individuals

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.680
But perhaps the most dangerous thing about them is the fact that they are hard to spot until it's too late

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:31.359
Too many individuals have been drawn in and charmed by a psychopath only to realize that a monster was lurking behind their seemingly

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.870
charming facade

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.529
So, how do you tell if a psychopath is targeting you?

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.209
Thankfully psychopathy has been an area of high interest for many psychological

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:46.269
Researchers and they've discovered many traits of psychopaths that will give them away at least if you know what to look for

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.210
number one grooming

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.900
Grooming is when Psychopaths target and prepare their victims

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.379
Grooming can include a variety of different activities and tactics like giving gifts help or favors

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:06.609
But the aim is always the same win their trust and encourage submission in order to facilitate mental physical or sexual abuse

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.409
Number two Psychopaths will watch you carefully

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.299
Psychopaths view people very differently than you or I would look at someone

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.960
they see them as little more than prey and the way that they watch their prey is not that different from the hunting tactics of

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.049
a lion

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.078
Many reveal that when talking to a psychopath. It seems like they're not blinking or showing any emotion

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.079
That's because they're scanning you for any weakness

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.159
Number three appear as a savior

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.109
Sometimes Psychopaths watch you carefully to attack in a non-physical way

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.089
They will often come to you as a Savior pretending to have something you want or need

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.089
They will give them what they need earn their trust and then threaten to take it away in order to manipulate them

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.070
Number four

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.070
psychopaths use aliases

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.429
Interestingly enough. There are possible overlaps between psychopathy and antisocial personality disorder

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.189
people with antisocial personality

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.910
disorders tend to use an alias when targeting people as do Psychopaths

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.260
number five

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.910
Psychopaths can be charming

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.439
When a psychopath approaches a victim he or she will often seem incredibly charming but the more sensitive and wary

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.169
Individuals will note that there is something wrong or off about this charm. It just doesn't seem right

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.730
That's because it's all an act and the psychopath doesn't actually care about you

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.830
number six

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.830
Psychopaths will try to use you

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.020
The end goal of a psychopath is to get something from you many times

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.010
This is simply to watch you die or to rape and sexually humiliate you

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.089
Other times it can involve manipulating you into achieving their goals

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.710
Number seven, you might never see a psychopath coming

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.719
The most disturbing thing about Psychopaths might well be their ability to blend in

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.689
This makes them difficult. If not impossible to detect you might not be able to tell if someone is a psychopath

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.610
Remember they can appear anywhere even in positions of power and responsibility

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.600
positions that are supposed to be occupied by people that you can trust

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.340
number eight

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.400
Psychopaths will talk in a certain way

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.579
Psychopaths have trouble controlling their desires and this can manifest itself in a very visible way

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.610
Psychopaths often seem very impulsive and are unable to focus on one thing for a long time

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.719
Especially if they are attracted to numerous things at once this can become obvious in the way a psychopath stalks and communicates

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.080
number-9 learned helplessness

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:49.990
Learned helplessness is an interesting phenomenon. It's defined as a condition in which a person suffers from a sense of powerlessness

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.310
Arising from a traumatic event or persistent failure to succeed. It is thought to be one of the underlying causes of depression

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.119
This is a commonly used tactic by psychopaths to

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:09.040
Psychologically break people if you can instigate learned helplessness in someone it will destroy their self esteem and deeply humiliate them

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.020
number 10

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.020
Psychopaths will isolate you

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.920
Another thing that Psychopaths will often try to do is get you alone

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.570
This is because Psychopaths can better manipulate you or harm you when you're in a one-on-one setting they know that individuals

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.200
Especially shy ones will be more submissive and more likely to obey when they don't have the safety of others to turn to in

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.549
Addition Psychopaths know that they are more likely to get away with their crimes if no one is watching

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.030
Do you know anyone with five or more of these signs?
