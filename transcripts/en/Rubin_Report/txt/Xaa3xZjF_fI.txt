Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:04          So I think I, the first time we sat down, I think I asked you this, so this seems like the right segue for it. So for everything that we've talked about here and the addiction to age and all that, there's gonna be a certain amount of people that are watching this and going, wait a minute, Glenn Beck was one of the people that was peddling this stuff.

Speaker 3:          00:18          Huh?

Speaker 2:          00:19          I as well, I think I know you pretty well right now. And I feel like you are honest in your beliefs and you've, you've had some mayor Kulpa is about some of the things you've said. Even just a, you got into something on Twitter with my friend Marge and new eyes and new fully. He, he sent you a clip of something that you did about him a couple of years back and you fully, you apologized immediately. You said, I'd love to talk to you and learn more and all of those things.

Speaker 3:          00:43          I just asked that to him today and what he is he coming in? Yeah. And I know, and I loop you guys in an email, right? So, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:50          is there anything you can add to that about just sort of how you've changed? Like, do you remember a moment, was there something about that? Because maybe there are people that are going down that road right now that's still want more of the outrage and stiller is still are, you know, as they call it, shit posting on Twitter and the rest of it. Um, if you were trying to get somebody to turn back,

Speaker 3:          01:09          no, cause they were really personal experiences. I went from the, you know, that, that global poll that comes out around Christmas time, you know, uh, most admired man in the world. Yeah. I was tied with the pope just behind Nelson Mandela. Okay. That's insane. That's insane. 12 months later, I'm no longer on that list. I'm hated. Yeah. I was saying the same things, CNN that I was saying on Fox. Okay. So that was confusing. Um, and it was, you know, you can't be hated by half of the country. I mean, unless you're just, um, you know, maniacal, you know, egomaniac that is just beyond any kind of redemption. You cannot be hated by half of the country. You know, a a false hero for the other half of the country and not go, okay, I'm not that. I don't think I'm that. Yeah. So who am I?

Speaker 3:          02:17          What part of it most people will go, well, they spent millions of dollars to destroy my reputation, to take things out of context. And they did. But I also did things because my philosophy at the time was if I can get enough eyeballs, if I can get people to watch, which puts me in leader Hosan, you know, seeing engage Levis that can get people to watch. Yeah. Then I present them with facts and my opinion of where it's going. It forget about everything else. They'll hang onto the facts and someone in the press, we'll go, I hate that. So I'm going to prove him wrong.

Speaker 2:          03:01          They never did. They never would look at the facts. So this is always where they just want to belittle you and shame just to silence you

Speaker 3:          03:09          and I, and I helped them. Okay. I added to that. So I'm not saying it's somebody else. I am taking my, my responsibility, but the biggest thing is now on the other side, I can look and say, wait, all of you in the press, you said I was the worst. Let me go get the transcripts. See what I just said? That's what you said to the 10th power right here. It's, they won't work. It's wrong and it won't work, but nobody wants to do that. Nobody wants to look. They, everyone wants to point to the other person. Nobody's willing to go. I said me,

Speaker 2:          03:54          but you think that 70% that you mentioned before, maybe starting to do that a little bit. I mean, again, I'm trying, if I'm trying to find how to get out of this thing. Okay. And I think that 70% where I'm meeting, I know it's a select group because they're coming, they're coming to see me and Jordan and take 70% take 17

Speaker 3:          04:11          yeah, 10 committed, 10% committed changes. The world. 17 is your tipping point, so it doesn't take all of us. Revolution was fought by about 20% of America. Okay? Those were the ones who said, I believe in this. We have to, we have to understand, and a lot of the book is about postmodernism and how that works and what its goals are. What does postmodern even mean? What is, what's the modern world? It's not about a machine. It's about the scientific process. It's about exploration and empirical data and testing a and B and living with the results. That's what the modern world is. So when you realize,

Speaker 2:          04:59          so you would say postmodern really is auntie modern in essence because it's going against the ways that we've been able to measure anything. The way we've been able to look at

Speaker 3:          05:09          only you can, when you don't understand postmodernism and you read the headline, which I did, math is racist. You either go, these people are out of their can minds and I can't take it anymore. Or you can say how? How did they get there? When you asked that question, you start to go and peel the layers down and you see the core of this idea good or bad that what came out of the modern era of the enlightenment was this and they say

Speaker 2:          05:51          this is bad. They say this is bad. That. That really is it. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          05:54          and anything that holds this up must be destroyed. If that's math, if that's you. Doesn't matter.

Speaker 4:          06:03          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          06:03          If you understand that it's all about deconstruction and deconstruction is all about chaos. You must not do anything to hasten the chaos. You have to restrain yourself. The best way to fight this isn't about Gandhi. Oh, I want to beat just like Jesus. No, I want to win and the best way to win is to restrain yourself from adding any of the chaos. Be Clear, be stuffed, spoken. Be the person that everybody in the room, when everybody is arguing, they kind of look around the room and there's maybe three people over there that are just laughing and having fun and just because you will be the one that will control the room. In the end, everybody else will kill themselves, but the the, the majority of people will go, oh, I hate this, and they'll make their way over to you. That's what we have to do. We have to stop fighting on the stupid stuff. The stupid stuff.

Speaker 4:          07:00          Yeah.

Speaker 3:          07:00          Gay wedding cakes. Good God, man. Homosexuals right now, today in parts of the country. What do you say? We start there? What do you say? We talk about something that really makes a difference. Really makes a difference. We get to the gay wedding cakes. Yeah, let's be good people first. Yeah. It's so interesting how people just don't want to do the intellectual work and now it's like we have these, we have these phones, we have endless distractions. To the point that perhaps 20 years ago you might have a moment standing on a corner waiting for a friend to go to dinner where you'd have to think, but we can distract ourselves to the point where we actually never have to think anymore. When was the last time you just stood somewhere? I mean, I know you're aware of all of this stuff, but when it was, let's have you, Glenn Beck just stood somewhere on the corner waiting for your wife to meet you and you weren't looking at your phone or you were in, you know, I him to do what you did, but I can't do it for a month. I have too many employees. That's the problem. I only have like five [inaudible]. I, I, I try to do it once a week. Don't make it every time, but just, I'm not going to be online. Do not pick up your device, go out on a date with your wife and do not carry a device. You don't have it with you. Um, that's important. And it's important, Dave, because I learned something with my alcoholism.

Speaker 3:          08:35          I was struggling with so many things when I was younger, um, that I didn't want to think about. I didn't want to think about it. I didn't want to think about the things that I had done in my life. The things that I was, oh, poor me about it. Just didn't want to think about it. And I would turn on the radio and I turn it up loud and I'd be driving my car and I never really consciously connected the two. It got to the point where it was so bad that if I didn't have something to distract, I would literally be by myself and I go la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. Just to block out my thoughts. Okay. That's a problem. And I realized when I was finally no longer, I was sober and not, uh, uh, and not just not drinking, uh, was the time that I was driving someplace and I must've been driving for about an hour and I hadn't turned anything on. And I realized at one point I'm just driving and I kind of come to kind of come to thinking, you know, about what's in the car, what's happening? And I'm like, oh, I wonder what's on the rate. Oh my gosh, I've been alone with myself and my thoughts for an hour. That's a sign of mental health. Yeah, we're sick. We're sick.

Speaker 2:          09:56          So in the, uh, in the book in the, in the forward, you a very graciously, and I'm humbled that you did it, you included me in a list of names of people that you, uh, that you put in there. Um, and

Speaker 3:          10:13          Ben had this and I wrote, I even wrote to, to Ben, I wrote is an inscription on this page. Yeah. Like two days later he calls me, oh my gosh. We were with each other for two days. And he was like, hey, thanks very much. And then like at midnight one night I get this text, he's a busy guy and I know to those who are willing to step out in front of the crowd to question reason and have dangerous conversations, men with whom I may strongly disagree with at times, but we'll all, I will always consider [inaudible] founders of reason and contemporary heroes. Ben Shapiro, Dave Ruben, Jordan Peterson, Bret Weinstein, Sam Harris, Jonathan Sacks, pendula,

Speaker 2:          10:51          Joe Rogan. So I thought, I don't want to make this about me. So the one that I thought was most interesting, they're actually with Sam Harris because I suspect you guys probably, if he disagrees with Jordan Peterson on everything, pretty much everything, policy, existentialism meaning a life, the whole damn thing. You guys probably disagree on everything plus one. I don't know if we went through no, and I thought, well this is what it's all about. This is what it's all about. So, but would you have ever, I mean, 20 years ago, if you were writing a book, you would,

Speaker 3:          11:23          that's when I, I've often joked that my library is a library of a serial killer because I was too broke to actually go get a formal education. So I would go to Barnes and noble or the library and I'd go, who hates each other, this opinion, who hates this opinion, that person. And I would read them both and I would look at him and say, is there any, anything where they intersect because I know is true. If both these people are from opposite ends of the spectrum. And they both say this is true. I know that one line in both books is true. Okay. So start small and build the basis of truth. And what motivated me was aligned from Thomas Jefferson, uh, that he wrote to his nephew Peter car. Peter's parents had both died. Um, when his dad was ill, he said, can you please educate my son when he comes of age?

Speaker 3:          12:24          So Thomas writes this unbelievable letter, you know, in mathematics you have to do this. In literature, you have to do this. The last thing is religion. And I love it. It's changed my life. MMM. When it comes to religion, above all things, fix reason firmly in her seat and question with boldness, even the very existence of God for if there be a god he must surely rather honest questioning over blindfolded fear. We break down on the word honest, honest questioning you and I liked each other and get along because you haven't asked me a setup question and I've never asked you a set up question. It's an honest question. Hang on just a second. But that right. But that, that is it and that's good. But yeah, that keeps you young, that keeps you alive. The minute used to, I knew my father was going to die.

Speaker 3:          13:24          My father was the kind of guy who always had a book in his back pocket. Okay. Self educated man. And uh, he's always exploring and questioning and he was so granola fruit loop, be one with the universe kind of guy. And I called him up. We were best friends for a long time. And um, I'd call him sometimes two, three times a day. And we just talk about books, we're reading and things. Did you hear this opinion? What do you think of this? We talked about the future, the past, all of it. And I said, Dad, I just read this fantastic book. You have to read this. I'm going to send it to you. And he said, hmm, that's okay. And I said, alright. And he said, I'm tired. I'm tired. I think I've learned enough. Huh? Three years later he was, he was gone. When you, when you are not, we are built to explore. And when you're not exploring what's left, well, what would you be doing if you weren't doing this?

Speaker 3:          14:43          I told my wife when she married me, and this is one reason I've lucked out so much. My wife hates fame. She hates wealth. She hates red carpet, ate all of it cause she married me and her family was like, you're not gonna marry him. He is a loser. He's not going to imagine, he's not going to amount to anything. Um, when she married me because I'm the first out of every generation that we can find going back. I'm the first male that has not become a baker. And so I would probably probably be a chef in some place or I'm not good at baking.

Speaker 2:          15:20          I was just gonna say, would you bake me a cake? That's

Speaker 3:          15:22          no, I'm not good at baking. I am good advice. My father said baking sun is about formulas. Cooking is winging it. Yeah. And I'm not good with formulas to inpatient.

Speaker 2:          15:36          You're, you're a definitely a, a wing in it Kinda guy. So generally speaking, do you feel it's funny, the first half of what we've done here was sort of fire and brimstone, sort of, or laying out, you know, this is, this thing could really go off the rails. I think the last 20 minutes or so it's been a little more hopeful.

Speaker 3:          15:53          I'm an optimistic catastrophist you do not want me, you do not want to be anywhere near me on the titanic until we get to the iceberg. As we're going into the iceberg, I'm saying, are you kidding me? Have you counted the lifeboats? There's not enough lifeboats. We're headed into cold area. If there is, if these people, they're going to be irresponsible, they're not going to pay attention to the ice, but they're arrogant. They're gonna hit the iceberg and all going to die. Okay. Soon as we hit that iceberg, I'm there. We're gonna make it. We're gonna make it because I believe that when people are awake, they will awaken to who they truly are. And I think Americans are different. We have this spirit us of exploration. We're the people who cross the oceans were the people that cross the Rockies. I have to tell you if, if I were alive during the time when we were exploring, I d I don't even think I would have made it past the Missouri, but definitely I would have gotten to Denver and went, okay guys, I am not going any.

Speaker 3:          17:03          We're not crossing. Okay. I always think every time I'm on the, uh, on, uh, what is it? The five, uh, that goes by the, the Getty Museum, which, which is, that fell the four oh five zero five. Every time I'm on the four oh five we bumped to la. So I see the Getty museum up there and I think if I were a pioneer and I made it this far, I would have built my house in this valley and people would have been on the top of the hill going, you should see what's on. And I'd be like, I am done. But generally people are explorers, they're good and they're, they're hardy and they want to live. I think they do want to live and they want to live in peace and harmony. I think that about the Palestinians and the Israelis when if you could, and I've done it, I've done it. When you don't have a camera in somebody's face and nobody knows you're talking, you sit down in a house of a Palestinian and most likely average person, they're like, I don't really care. I mean I just, I want to raise my family. I just want to be left alone. I want to be able to eat maybe a little extra money, sole life, and I can go off for a nice weekend. That's people. It's when everybody starts telling them it's them, you know, that's keeping you down. That's what their struggle.

Speaker 2:          18:30          You find it weird in a way that, um, we're thought of as political beast because in a certain way we really haven't talked about politics here. And I find now, I'm probably less interested in politics now today than I've ever been in my adult life in a bizarre way. You know what I mean? Like I still, I still love it at some level, but like what we're doing here and what I think the real conversation happening in the world right now is, is not political. There's a class of people that are trying to make everything political and keep you confused and controlled. Flooding the Russians. Do you see the latest the Russians, believe it or not, the Russians, one of their, one of their, yeah,

Speaker 3:          19:10          campaigns happened when, uh,

Speaker 2:          19:13          I don't remember which was that the last, the last star wars movie, I think. Oh, I did see this. They said that, uh, the last jet I, that is Russian bots, right? Well, that's what Ryan Johnson, I guess was there is evidence that they were s they were politicizing the movie that they were, they were putting out, oh, you're not gonna like that robot because that robot, it's all about social justice. I remember seeing it. The movie did suck and we, you know, yeah, he's here. I'm with you. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          19:44          But what I'm saying is we have outside influences that are trying to make everything about politics. Read the book, defining Hitler is the best, best explanation of what happened in Germany. Ever

Speaker 2:          20:00          written by a guy at the time as a warning to the west. Go and you don't know what, you don't know where we've been. You don't know what's happening here. Warning. And so he, he really gives you a, a look at what was happening prior to, and you can see it. You're like, oh my gosh, that's the world trade center going down. Oh my gosh, that's this. You can see it

Speaker 3:          20:19          repeating it. And he says, right, right around 1933 nothing is not political. There is not one topic

Speaker 2:          20:29          that is political. When did this happen to us? It's incredible. I mean just, you know, I never watch cable news anymore and I don't even watch sports channels anymore because it's all political. But when I'm doing cardio, I'll just flip channels and everything. You go to his political, the view is now always political. If you're watching women's, you know, basically women's television in the, the ESPN now is political all the time. I mean every channel. So you'd probably turn on the food channel and there's some political situation happens.

Speaker 3:          20:54          Let me tell you something that I've never said out loud. Only person I think that even knows it in my own company. Oh, Stu, my executive producer, I couldn't tell you any of the names of the people that are running for House and Senate. I'm on talk radio. I don't care. I don't care. I pay somebody to look at that. Tell me what's the balance of the House for the audience? It does not affect me one iota except in the big picture. Which movement is moving. I just, it, it's a waste of our time. Think of how many man hours America has lost in the last 15 years. Think of what we could have done with all of this time. Forget about the money.

Speaker 2:          21:50          Is that the best argument for basically sort of classical liberalism or libertarianism that if we could just reign this thing in, that not only could you live however you want it to live? Basically, if the government was just pretended protecting your, your life and your property, your rights, your rights, right. That not only would that be good because you could do what you want, but it would actually, Evan would save you money and see, Oh yeah,

Speaker 3:          22:13          you'd heal. You'd still have it. You'd have it still on the local side, which would be great that that would actually, you know what I mean? Is You'd still have people who had tried to take the local area and they'd be the big boss of the area, so you'd have those things you'd have at least, you'd have a little more control over that you could control it or you could move to the next town. You know what I mean? San Francisco can be as weird as it wants to be. They could live in, you know, six feet of human poop. That's fine. If that's what you want to do.

Speaker 2:          22:48          You know there's an app for the human poop. Did you know that? I'm not kidding. There's actually an APP that tells you where human poop is on the streets in San Francisco.

Speaker 3:          22:57          Literally going back. It's insane. It's insane. I, I remember saying, I remember saying people, there's gonna come a time where you, we will not recognize your country. What you thought was solid will be liquid. What you thought was real will be false. You're not going to recognize it. We're not only so far past that point now too, where you're like, I don't even know who anyone is. I don't know what is real, what's, I don't know, up and down anymore. We're so far past that, but what's incredible and this is a good thing, or could it a good thing because of technology by 2030 you're not going to recognize it. Anything. Nothing will be the same. Nothing will be the same. It will be the difference between looking at our lives in 2030 looking back and going, Dave, you remember 2018 when we sat, it will be as different than as if we were sitting in now and going, man, can you imagine what 1920 was like? It's going to be

Speaker 2:          24:07          be that different. You know, this reminds me of a align, I interviewed Peter Teal a couple of weeks ago and he said that um, crypto is for libertarians and AI is for authoritarians. And I think that that sort of gets to the heart of what you're saying because maybe what's going to happen here is that as our institutions, our political institutions, academic institutions, media institutions, as they become so big, they can't sustain themselves anymore. So maybe we will sort of break off into smaller communities, whatever that means. And we'll sort of is about, that's what the,

Speaker 3:          24:40          that's what the declaration of independence and the constitution encouraged, encouraged,

Speaker 2:          24:46          break off, do your own thing. You should be a little laboratory, be a little laboratory. You come up with some of the great, I'm sure the other states and the other cities will adopt it. If, if it works, we're all love it. Stop, stop. It's, it's not one experiment. Why are we so, Lillian, why are we so afraid of that? Because I pushed that idea constantly and it's like, you know, just that the, that the laboratory should exist so that if you want low taxes, you go here. But then if that screws over the schools then go somewhere else or whatever it is that, that play. But people are really afraid of that. That somehow we're not actually America if we don't live under the same exact laws everywhere at which, as you said, is the antithesis of, of the founding documents.

Speaker 3:          25:25          People just have been convinced that people are not trustworthy. Well, people aren't trustworthy if they never get in trouble. If they never, banks are not trustworthy. If they never have to pay for their own mistakes, they're not trustworthy. Um, when you have to pay for your own mistake, you learn when people generally become trustworthy. You brought up Peter Teal. People ask me all the time, are you concerned about deeply? Yes. I'm concerned about d platforming big time and especially Dave with what's coming with, with deep fakes and all the, there is trouble on the horizon. Peter, every time somebody says something, I always say, you know the guy who can solve this Peter Teal because we need a platform and I mean left and right. A platform whose charter is the bill of rights. That's it. If you agree with the bill of rights, you're not trying to shut anybody up.

Speaker 3:          26:29          You believe in these things, these human principles, what make us human. Come on, put your thing on here. We're not going to kick anybody off. We're not going to do anything. Is this a, this a place where speech will be protected because thoughts are supposed to be dangerous. It's only the dangerous thoughts that led us to the moon. It's only the dangerous thoughts that invented television or the Internet. It's a dangerous thought that that said, I wonder if I can make fire like the sky does or that's a dangerous thought. You're going to burn everything down. Well, they didn't. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          27:09          Well, I can't say more than if you saw my, uh, chat with Eric Weinstein a couple of weeks ago. The billionaire class is talking now. So there, there is some upbeat to hear that. Yeah. One other thing on that and then, uh, I will let your staff do other, I assume they have other work to do around here. You people do another work around here that you got things to do today to, um, do you think that if we get out of this thing and it, and it's basically okay out of this sort of morass that we're in right now and that is basically okay that we'll look back on this and think, whoa, there was something really good that came out of it because

Speaker 3:          27:48          yeah. Barack Obama was my biggest nemesis. You don't know. You don't know what it's like to come under attack until the president of the United States. I've had two of them now. Yeah. Is coming after you directly and using the force of his friends and allies to come after. Who was the other one that went after? It was not, Trump's probably was drunk. Yeah. During, but yeah, at the beginning. The beginning. Yeah. So

Speaker 2:          28:16          call you after you basically were like, all right, I'll, no, no, nothing. You didn't get anything? Nothing. No, no, no. All right.

Speaker 3:          28:22          And I'm fine with that. Yeah. Um, uh, what was what we were talking about that will come out on their side, but we'll look back and this is getting Obama and Donald Trump have been some of the best things that's ever happened to me. And I don't mean financially or, you know, whatever. I mean as a man because they've both taken me by the lapels and shoved me up against the wall and said, what is it you really believe we are so blessed. Do you know that really, even my father's generation, he came at the end of, you know, he was born in 26 so he, you know, he saw World War II and stuff, but anybody who really grew up in lived from 1946 until now, we really have been very blessed. But we've also been cursed. No one has had to have everything about them challenged. I'm a better man. You're a better man because every time somebody throws you up against the wall, we will be a better country. We'll be a stronger, more vibrant, more free people if we behave ourselves and learn from what's throwing us up against the wall. That's how I ended in interview back. Good word rhetoric.
