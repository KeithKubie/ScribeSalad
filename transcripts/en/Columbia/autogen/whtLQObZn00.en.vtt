the one that I've been working on the

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770
the one that I've been working on the
 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.749
the one that I've been working on the
longest is in Puerto Rico and well we're

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759
longest is in Puerto Rico and well we're
 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.190
longest is in Puerto Rico and well we're
interested in trying to understand there

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200
interested in trying to understand there
 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.400
interested in trying to understand there
is how the process of agricultural

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410
is how the process of agricultural
 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.820
is how the process of agricultural
abandonment s countries go through seven

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830
abandonment s countries go through seven
 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.010
abandonment s countries go through seven
on the development oftentimes would you

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020
on the development oftentimes would you
 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.840
on the development oftentimes would you
see the perineum which go to is

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850
see the perineum which go to is
 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.310
see the perineum which go to is
abandoned and then you tropical areas

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320
abandoned and then you tropical areas
 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.230
abandoned and then you tropical areas
particularly wet tropical areas you know

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
particularly wet tropical areas you know
 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.750
particularly wet tropical areas you know
for is just groups and so we're trying

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760
for is just groups and so we're trying
 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.870
for is just groups and so we're trying
to understand where the dynamics of that

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880
to understand where the dynamics of that
 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.640
to understand where the dynamics of that
by for a girl with as far as a girl why

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650
by for a girl with as far as a girl why
 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.710
by for a girl with as far as a girl why
and ways important substance abandoning

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720
and ways important substance abandoning
 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.060
and ways important substance abandoning
factors versus you know the presence of

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070
factors versus you know the presence of
 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.370
factors versus you know the presence of
other forests that can act as seed

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380
other forests that can act as seed
 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.810
other forests that can act as seed
sources and so forth and so that's kind

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820
sources and so forth and so that's kind
 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.130
sources and so forth and so that's kind
of like the big picture issues but I'm

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140
of like the big picture issues but I'm
 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.170
of like the big picture issues but I'm
more interested in the big question from

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180
more interested in the big question from
 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.729
more interested in the big question from
the point of view of kind of global

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739
the point of view of kind of global
 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.799
the point of view of kind of global
issues is whether this is not a

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809
issues is whether this is not a
 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.299
issues is whether this is not a
phenomenon that is limited to Puerto

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309
phenomenon that is limited to Puerto
 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.590
phenomenon that is limited to Puerto
Rico this is happening all over the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600
Rico this is happening all over the
 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:06.430
Rico this is happening all over the
world so to what the Greek and

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440
 
 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.240
 
bridging and so you know we look at

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250
bridging and so you know we look at
 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.240
bridging and so you know we look at
things like can they provide the kind of

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250
things like can they provide the kind of
 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.590
things like can they provide the kind of
biodiversity can they provide you know

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600
biodiversity can they provide you know
 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.750
biodiversity can they provide you know
so people would tell topical for is you

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760
so people would tell topical for is you
 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.690
so people would tell topical for is you
know they provide carbon they clean

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700
know they provide carbon they clean
 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.430
know they provide carbon they clean
water flow they do all these things

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440
water flow they do all these things
 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.800
water flow they do all these things
right and so we look at kind of larger

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810
right and so we look at kind of larger
 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.469
right and so we look at kind of larger
scale and trying to understand what is

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479
scale and trying to understand what is
 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.260
scale and trying to understand what is
that true or not I bought a scale

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270
that true or not I bought a scale
 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.880
that true or not I bought a scale
through these processes operates I'm

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
through these processes operates I'm
 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.590
through these processes operates I'm
very interested you know if you sort of

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600
very interested you know if you sort of
 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.450
very interested you know if you sort of
look at the what unites my research

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460
look at the what unites my research
 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.700
look at the what unites my research
interests I'm very interested in how

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710
interests I'm very interested in how
 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.600
interests I'm very interested in how
processes change put a different scale

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610
processes change put a different scale
 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.460
processes change put a different scale
filter right because often times

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470
filter right because often times
 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.910
filter right because often times
decisions have to be made different

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920
decisions have to be made different
 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.020
decisions have to be made different
units at the National Laboratories at

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030
units at the National Laboratories at
 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.090
units at the National Laboratories at
the municipality level so to what degree

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100
the municipality level so to what degree
 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.499
the municipality level so to what degree
can we provide information that is

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509
can we provide information that is
 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.480
can we provide information that is
useful this particular because the

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490
useful this particular because the
 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.800
useful this particular because the
players are different the stoker new

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
players are different the stoker new
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.080
players are different the stoker new
stakeholders are different so that's a

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090
stakeholders are different so that's a
 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.270
stakeholders are different so that's a
big thing
