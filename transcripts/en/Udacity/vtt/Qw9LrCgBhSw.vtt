00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The correct answer is the third choice.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
What we'd really like to be able to show is that we can reduce

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
some known hard problem to the Diffie-Hellman problem,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and the important thing is that this would show that anyone

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
who can solve the Diffie-Hellman problem would also be able to solve

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
some problem that we already know is hard.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Showing that the problem is hard just shows that if we have a large enough

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
instance of it, it can't be solved with a certain amount of computational resources,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and we hope that by picking a large enough instance

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we can make the work for the attacker far beyond

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
what any attacker could afford.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
That does depend on this property, so it depends on the number of values being high.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
That itself is not a useful proof of security.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
What we need to know is that there's no easier way to solve the problem

00:00:41.000 --> 99:59:59.000
than trying all the possible values.
