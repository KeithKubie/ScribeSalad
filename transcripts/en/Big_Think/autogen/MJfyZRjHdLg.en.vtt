well science is telling us that we can

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750
well science is telling us that we can
 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.370
well science is telling us that we can
do phenomenal things if we put our minds

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:18.380
do phenomenal things if we put our minds
 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.589
do phenomenal things if we put our minds
and our resources to us I mean I think

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599
and our resources to us I mean I think
 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:23.019
and our resources to us I mean I think
science is probably the best example of

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029
science is probably the best example of
 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.080
science is probably the best example of
you put resources into something and you

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090
you put resources into something and you
 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.359
you put resources into something and you
let the creativity and the brilliance of

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369
let the creativity and the brilliance of
 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.130
let the creativity and the brilliance of
the minds throughout the world and

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140
the minds throughout the world and
 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.420
the minds throughout the world and
certainly not only in this country

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430
certainly not only in this country
 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.120
certainly not only in this country
throughout the world and phenomenally

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130
throughout the world and phenomenally
 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.310
throughout the world and phenomenally
good things can happen you've got to

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320
good things can happen you've got to
 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.530
good things can happen you've got to
make sure that there's checks and

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540
make sure that there's checks and
 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.210
make sure that there's checks and
balances on that because science can

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220
balances on that because science can
 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.340
balances on that because science can
also lead to things that are not so good

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350
also lead to things that are not so good
 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.840
also lead to things that are not so good

where you're swinging for discovery and

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050
where you're swinging for discovery and
 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.720
where you're swinging for discovery and
you're going to use discovery for the

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730
you're going to use discovery for the
 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.180
you're going to use discovery for the
betterment of mankind I think science

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190
betterment of mankind I think science
 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.820
betterment of mankind I think science
stands out among what some of the most

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830
stands out among what some of the most
 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.060
stands out among what some of the most
important endeavors that the humankind

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070
important endeavors that the humankind
 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.810
important endeavors that the humankind
can pursue mankind evolves I mean

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820
can pursue mankind evolves I mean
 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.910
can pursue mankind evolves I mean
there's no doubt that we have evolved

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920
there's no doubt that we have evolved
 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.690
there's no doubt that we have evolved
the whole issue of evolving through

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700
the whole issue of evolving through
 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.690
the whole issue of evolving through
various lower species to our own species

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700
various lower species to our own species
 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.660
various lower species to our own species
of the human but there's also the

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670
of the human but there's also the
 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.440
of the human but there's also the
continuing evolution that is associated

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450
continuing evolution that is associated
 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.330
continuing evolution that is associated
with mankind and a lot of that is using

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340
with mankind and a lot of that is using
 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.120
with mankind and a lot of that is using
what specifically and particularly and

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130
what specifically and particularly and
 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.609
what specifically and particularly and
peculiarly makes you a human being and

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619
peculiarly makes you a human being and
 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.550
peculiarly makes you a human being and
that is your intellect and your will you

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560
that is your intellect and your will you
 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.039
that is your intellect and your will you
have a choice you can analyze things and

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049
have a choice you can analyze things and
 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.080
have a choice you can analyze things and
you can act in an intellectual manner

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.090
you can act in an intellectual manner
 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.779
you can act in an intellectual manner
and that is to me that the very

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789
and that is to me that the very
 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.389
and that is to me that the very
foundation of what science is how you

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399
foundation of what science is how you
 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.740
foundation of what science is how you
can better your own lot the lot of the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750
can better your own lot the lot of the
 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.620
can better your own lot the lot of the
other citizens of the world while you're

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630
other citizens of the world while you're
 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.200
other citizens of the world while you're
paying attention to and preserving the

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210
paying attention to and preserving the
 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.819
paying attention to and preserving the
world you live in which is the reason

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829
world you live in which is the reason
 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.639
world you live in which is the reason
why things like the environment are so

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649
why things like the environment are so
 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.580
why things like the environment are so
so important when we try and analyze all

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590
so important when we try and analyze all
 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.800
so important when we try and analyze all
we doing things that are detrimental to

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810
we doing things that are detrimental to
 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.980
we doing things that are detrimental to
the environment and if so how do we stop

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990
the environment and if so how do we stop
 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.500
the environment and if so how do we stop
it and if we have to stop it how do we

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510
it and if we have to stop it how do we
 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.020
it and if we have to stop it how do we
replace it with something

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030
replace it with something
 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.570
replace it with something
that's environmentally friendly and I

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580
that's environmentally friendly and I
 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.670
that's environmentally friendly and I
think science is going to lead us there

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680
think science is going to lead us there
 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.250
think science is going to lead us there
and it's the goodwill that you have to

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260
and it's the goodwill that you have to
 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.260
and it's the goodwill that you have to
try and preserve your own species as

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270
try and preserve your own species as
 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.690
try and preserve your own species as
well as preserve the environment IE our

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700
well as preserve the environment IE our
 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.050
well as preserve the environment IE our
planet so that we can have thousands and

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060
planet so that we can have thousands and
 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.050
planet so that we can have thousands and
more years of people doing good things

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060
more years of people doing good things
 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.840
more years of people doing good things
in leading good lives
