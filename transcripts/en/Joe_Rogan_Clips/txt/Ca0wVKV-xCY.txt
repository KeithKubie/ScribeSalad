Speaker 1:          00:00          Yeah. So when you were a kid, you were, you were doing this, like you've been involved. So this is like the family business, sort of. My family businesses, my mom's business actually was safari businesses, so like, like you say, sit in a land rover, CD, animals kind of thing. Um, and they did a little bit of tourists walking safaris. But then I grew up on a farm in the outskirts of some of Harare, Zimbabwe. And then whenever I wasn't in school, I was on the farm run around barefoot, catching snakes, fishing, Yada Yada. And then when my mom wasn't booked up, she had this little Bush plane that she used for safaris and we'd just adventure all over Africa. Wow. So it was great childhood. That sounds amazing, but fucking terrifying. I mean, it's like one of those things where it's what you're used to write.

Speaker 1:          00:43          I found moving to the states at age 14 and like trying to find my place in the world, be in this weird little private school kid from Africa, way more terrifying than going to meet a tribe in the middle of the Bush, really? For sure. Yeah. Why? Um, like I'll give you examples. Like I always carry a pocket knife on me, right? My first day here in the states, I go to school, pull my pocket, I'm sitting in my like uniform. So I went to a very proper English boarding school, pull out my pocket knife, start cutting my apple. 15 minutes later I'm in handcuffs and I'm like, what did I do? What did I do? I literally had no idea what I had done wrong, but because I had a knife at school, everybody I had ever been to school with had a knife to cut their apple.

Speaker 1:          01:20          Like it was the standard thing. So here I am with like police and you know, guns and badges and they're throwing me in handcuffs and taking me out of the school on day one in America. And I'm like, this is the scariest thing I've ever seen. And I didn't even learn until later that day that it was because I had a pocket knife. And at no point did I think having a pocket knife is a bad thing. So they didn't tell you? No, they just grabbed me. There was like this whole thing, like the knife went flying, I was chained up and I was like, what's going on? What's going on? And they're like, you're in big trouble and ask why. And uh, you know, it was like little culture shock, things like that. That to me where like something I'd done everyday my whole life and now I'm like getting thrown in Juvie for it kind of thing.

Speaker 1:          01:58          When you think back about that, do you think that's just the consequences of being in a large population? For sure. Yeah. Yeah. I mean like we, like I say, I went to school everyday with a knife. There was no violence issues, there was nothing like that. But then you come here where, you know, the stabbings and stuff like that and it's because, you know, we had a tie. I lived in a tiny country with a tiny population. Do you think that it's possible that I may, I mean stupid, but there's no way you could live like that over here. I mean, there's no way you can have kids with a bunch of knives. No, I don't. Culture, I don't. Yeah, I don't think so at all. I think that would be terrible. And I get it now as an adult. Nobody talked to you about it before you left the house?

Speaker 1:          02:35          No, my mom didn't know. She's from Africa. You know, she's like, here are your things, here's my cool. But it might be shared. Sharpen it before you get to tell a man. Wow. So you were doing these always doing these walking safaris. You, you started out doing the driving ones and then eventually you started doing the walking ones? My family business did walking's as far as they didn't do hunting, it was all photographic. Um, and we were in the Zambezi valley, so as Mbz River's one of the biggest rivers in the world. So we do these walking safaris and then we did canoes safaris as well, which is why I have so many hippo and croc stories cause we'd be canoeing down the Zambezi river. Um, and then taking photographs and seeing wildlife that way. Wow. What a crazy way to grow up, man. It was awesome.

Speaker 1:          03:14          Your relationship to wildlife, it's just so different than the average person in this country. For sure. It's very intimate. Like I, I, I feel like I have, like regardless of being a scientist by trade, I feel like I have a very intimate understanding of animals cause I grew up completely surrounded by them. Now what other countries have you explored? I'm over 60 countries now. Yeah. So a lot. All for wildlife work. Um, whether it's for the show that I do or for biology contracts before I did the show or just because like for instance, when I got done with college, I was like, I had a little tiny little business starting college, sold it and was like, I'm going to travel the world and try and photograph these animals. And I went to 28 countries looking for wildlife.
