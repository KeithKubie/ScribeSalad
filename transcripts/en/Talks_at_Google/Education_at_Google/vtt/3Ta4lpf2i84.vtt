00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.270
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.390
Thanks for coming out this
afternoon for this edition

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:15.900
of Talks@.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.780
Today's speaker is David Burkus.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.590
His latest book, "Under New
Management," which many of you

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.040
have but Steve doesn't, reveals
the counterintuitive leadership

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.500
practices that enhance
engagement and drive

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.680
performance.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.900
He's also the author of "Myths
of Creativity: The Truth

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.350
About How Innovative
Companies and People Generate

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.520
Great Ideas."

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.250
I'm personally hoping
we have some time

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.515
to talk about that today.

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:41.640
He's a contributor to the
"Harvard Business Review"

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.510
and "Forbes."

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.120
He's also been featured in
"Fast Company," the "Financial

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.610
Times," "Bloomberg
Businessweek," and "CBS

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.600
This Morning."

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.630
He's been a featured and keynote
speaker at many Fortune 500

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.480
companies, including
this one, as well as

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.940
Microsoft and Stryker.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.200
He's a TEDx speaker.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.370
I've watched some of his video
on the YouTube and TED channel.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.630
He's also been at
South by Southwest,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.430
and he's also done
speaking at the US Naval

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.430
Academy and the Naval
Postgraduate School.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.350
He's an associate professor
at Oral Roberts University,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.140
where he teaches and lives with
his wife and their two boys.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.040
So please join me in welcoming
David to speak here today.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.180
Thanks very much.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.780
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.070
DAVID BURKUS:
Actually, you're never

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.950
supposed to say I'm excited
to be here as a speaker.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.390
This is, like, coaching
rule number two,

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.310
right after they tell you
don't actually picture them

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.330
in their underwear.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.520
They tell you don't say
you're excited to be here

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.300
because what's the alternative?

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.130
You're really mad and ticked off
to be here, which is not true.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.100
I'm legitimately excited
here mostly because one thing

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.090
that I guess I normally
leave off my bio,

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.720
but for years [INAUDIBLE]
is that I grew up

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.880
in Groton, Massachusetts.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.376
And I haven't been back in
Boston in, like, five years.

00:02:03.376 --> 00:02:04.750
And so it's really
exciting to me

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:06.130
to actually finally
be back here.

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.338
So thank you for having me,
just because you got back

00:02:08.338 --> 00:02:11.760
to my hometown, which is great.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.140
I have a thesis.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.485
And I saw a couple
of people flipping

00:02:15.485 --> 00:02:16.610
through copies of the book.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.210
And you probably don't know it
yet because for some reason,

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.329
unlike a good researcher,
I put it at the end.

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:25.870
Mainly, I was writing
the entire book

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.150
and I was having
these conversations

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.525
with a variety of different
corporate and entrepreneurial

00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:30.060
leaders.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.500
And one person during
one of the conversations

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.375
said something that I
thought was brilliant,

00:02:34.375 --> 00:02:36.250
and so I decided I should
put it in the book.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.304
And I made the mistake
of putting it at the end.

00:02:38.304 --> 00:02:40.220
And I say it was a mistake
because it's really

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.178
sort of the guiding thesis
for the entire book,

00:02:42.178 --> 00:02:45.350
and it's this-- great leaders
don't innovate the product,

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.000
they innovate the factory.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.530
And I realize how
dangerous it is to say that

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.716
at a place like this, right?

00:02:51.716 --> 00:02:53.840
But what I mean is that
innovations to the factory,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.940
factory being a metaphor
for all of our workplaces,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.750
precede innovations
to the products.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.690
The innovations that we make to
how we work and where we work

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.570
precede our ability to innovate
in any other situation.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.470
And this has been true
for hundreds of years.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.030
This was true when a
young junior consultant

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.780
first approached
Bethlehem Steel and said,

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.910
I can turn around your problem.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.951
Now, you probably never
heard of Bethlehem Steel.

00:03:15.951 --> 00:03:16.580
That's OK.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.050
But their impact resonated
for hundreds of years.

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.600
See, this young
junior consultant

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.790
wanted to help
Bethlehem Steel compete

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.390
with bigger captains
of industry,

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.090
like Carnegie Steel and a
variety of different places.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.970
And so he came with
what would later

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.240
be his world-renown stopwatch.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.220
And he begin to study the
production process at Bethlehem

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.600
Steel, and he begin to find
the optimal way to design

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.850
that production process.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.060
And then he started
training the labor force

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.770
on how to conform to
that one best way.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.730
And he revolutionized the
entire history of manufacturing.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:51.780
He made it possible in the
early 1900s for a variety

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.384
of different industrial growth.

00:03:53.384 --> 00:03:54.800
Some of you are
nodding your heads

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.070
because you've
figured out who it is.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.611
But if you haven't
yet, I'll give you

00:03:57.611 --> 00:03:59.950
a famous quote that
sort of embodies

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.090
what he believed about the
role of management and labor.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.020
And it was this--
"The duty of enforcing

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.490
the adoption of standards and
enforcing this cooperation

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.770
rests with management alone."

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.050
He was big on the idea
that you had management

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.510
and you had labor, and it was
best to keep the two separate

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.580
because labor was
too dumb to know how

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.180
to do something the right way.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.690
So it was management's job
to teach them how to do it,

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.019
labor's job to just do it.

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.600
This man was Frederick
Winslow Taylor.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.720
How many of you remember
Frederick Winslow Taylor?

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.780
So I teach undergraduate
management classes.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.320
And so we have to spend, like,
the first two weeks talking

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.710
about the amazing contribution
of Frederick Taylor,

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.547
and also why he
was totally wrong.

00:04:36.547 --> 00:04:38.630
Frederick Taylor was
definitely right for his era.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.200
He knew that you had to
reinvent the factory in order

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.450
to have all of the
innovations we needed to grow.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.450
That was very true,
and his impact

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.826
resonated for a
really long time.

00:04:46.826 --> 00:04:49.408
Taylor would write a book called
"The Principles of Scientific

00:04:49.408 --> 00:04:51.090
Management" that
is still in print.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.199
It's been over 100 years.

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:53.740
"Principles of
Scientific Management"

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.610
would travel the globe.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.734
It would be translated into
a variety of languages.

00:04:56.734 --> 00:04:59.750
Actually, Taylor's
grandson remarked one time

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.580
that he went to Japan
to visit executives

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.870
and they bowed
very deeply to him

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.290
just because he was the
grandson of Frederick Taylor.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:08.957
Taylor's devotees
would start a magazine

00:05:08.957 --> 00:05:11.290
about scientific management
that would morph and change,

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.300
and you know it now as
"Bloomberg Businessweek."

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.830
It got its start as a
fanzine for Frederick Taylor.

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.272
He also joined the faculty
at Tuck, Dartmouth's business

00:05:19.272 --> 00:05:20.980
school, one of the
first business schools

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:22.096
in the country.

00:05:22.096 --> 00:05:24.220
And he revolutionized
Bethlehem Steel and a variety

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.220
of different industries.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.600
We got where we are
right now because of what

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.520
Frederick Taylor did in
the physical factories.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.290
But where we are right now
is not the physical factory,

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.340
doesn't look like it.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:38.500
I have not been to many
actual manufacturing plants

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.060
with food that's good.

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.580
So it is not a physical factory.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.120
We've moved from a physical
factory to an idea factory.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.260
The products usually
aren't made by brute force.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.300
The unit of energy or where it
lies is not the bicep anymore.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.534
It's the brain.

00:05:53.534 --> 00:05:54.700
We designed it in our heads.

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:58.230
We moved from a physical
factory to an idea factory.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:00.400
But we drug Frederick
Taylor with us

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.440
from the factory to the office.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.310
And a lot of the ideas inside
of management theorists

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.479
are based in Frederick
Taylor's theories.

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:11.770
He's the foundation for almost
all management thinking.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:13.770
And while we point to
things-- Peter Drucker was

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.520
the first to do it--
we point to things

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.570
that signal to shift
from industrial work

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:19.809
to the knowledge economy,
we don't necessarily

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:21.600
point to the things
that we should probably

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.781
have not taken with us.

00:06:22.781 --> 00:06:24.280
And so today, I
want to talk briefly

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.615
about a lot of those
different things.

00:06:26.615 --> 00:06:27.990
I've surveyed the
Googlers that I

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.280
know about what would
be controversial but not

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:32.642
too controversial because
a lot of these ideas,

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:34.600
I find that everybody,
every innovative company

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.391
I've spoke at, is either
doing some of them

00:06:36.391 --> 00:06:38.130
or deliberately
not doing others.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:39.880
And so we'll have that
conversation, which

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.290
I think will be a lot of fun.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.400
But I want to start
with one that's probably

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.250
not one of the things
you think about,

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.390
even though it's so vital
to our work every day.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.848
And when you do
you think about it,

00:06:48.848 --> 00:06:51.320
you may not have very
positive thoughts.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.126
I want to talk about email.

00:06:53.126 --> 00:06:55.500
And I realize I'm speaking to
the group that power, like,

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.880
half the world's email.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.430
And so I don't want to
tell you you're wrong,

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.909
but I do want to join with
you in saying how many of you

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:05.200
actually hate your email inbox?

00:07:08.204 --> 00:07:09.870
And the Gmail inbox
is one of the better

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.699
ones for dealing with the
problem of email, right?

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:15.240
Everybody's making note on who
raised their hand, by the way.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.610
It's kind of funny.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:18.485
Everybody's looking
around-- who hates email?

00:07:18.485 --> 00:07:20.000
Email is an amazing tool.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.700
It's an amazing invention.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.610
And like most
amazing inventions,

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.850
we're using it for stuff it
was never designed to do.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.810
How many of you use
it as a to-do list?

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:32.060
How many of you have ever
said the phrase, if it's not

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.149
in my inbox, it won't get done?

00:07:35.149 --> 00:07:37.190
This was not what it was
originally intended for.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.681
And we have this idea that--
actually, here's another one.

00:07:40.681 --> 00:07:42.430
This is probably I'm
guilty of doing this,

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.737
and I wrote this chapter.

00:07:43.737 --> 00:07:45.320
How many of you have
ever cleared out,

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.805
gotten to inbox
zero, and thought,

00:07:46.805 --> 00:07:49.300
wow, I had a really
productive day today?

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.740
And then you're driving home
or you're taking the T home

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.430
and you're like, oh, actually,
I didn't do anything today

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.600
except respond to email?

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.510
So we have this theory that
it equals productivity,

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:01.280
but it's an inverted U.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.907
And a lot of places are finding
that it is that exact inverted

00:08:03.907 --> 00:08:06.240
U, that productivity can go
up through the communication

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.040
and collaboration
that it allows for,

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.354
but it can also go
dramatically down.

00:08:10.354 --> 00:08:11.770
And one company
in particular that

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:13.890
fascinated me was
a French company

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.890
called Atos, a
technology company

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:18.700
that basically said our
productivity is not happening

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:19.880
the way we want it to.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:22.300
And so led by their
CEO, they moved

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:27.050
to become a zero-email
company, zero internal email.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:30.000
They created a variety of
different products and tools

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.419
in order to use
communication tools.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.460
It's actually kind of
weird that I'm sitting here

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.370
talking about this
because when people ask me

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.120
what my favorite tool
to replace email is,

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.871
I tell them Google Wave.

00:08:39.871 --> 00:08:41.314
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:41.314 --> 00:08:43.080
I loved it.

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.049
Can I just say that?

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:46.470
I loved it.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:47.920
Apparently, other people didn't.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.480
But I thought it was brilliant.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.000
So maybe this is where we
start bringing that back,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.845
with this idea that
let's replace-- anyway,

00:08:53.845 --> 00:08:55.720
so they moved to become
a zero-email company.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.320
They custom-designed
a tool for them.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.770
But a lot of other companies
are finding the same thing.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.670
And they're using old-school
tools like the phone,

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.690
or like getting up
out of their desk

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:07.550
and walking over and
having a conversation.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:08.300
It's fascinating.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.804
But the idea that all of
these share is that email

00:09:11.804 --> 00:09:13.720
has a variety of different
costs and benefits,

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:17.000
and the costs are beginning
to not outweigh the benefits.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.200
So Atos moved to become
a zero-email company.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.500
They're still moving to
become a zero-email company.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.780
They're not quite there yet.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.550
But they have found that
as email's going down,

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.140
a variety of positives
are happening.

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.682
Their operating
margin has increased.

00:09:29.682 --> 00:09:31.348
Their earnings per
share have increased.

00:09:31.348 --> 00:09:33.060
Their administrative
costs have decreased

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.685
because, again,
there's just less email

00:09:34.685 --> 00:09:35.720
to have to sort through.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.365
It's been a really
good thing for them,

00:09:37.365 --> 00:09:39.115
and they've become
advocates for this sort

00:09:39.115 --> 00:09:41.217
of zero-email lifestyle.

00:09:41.217 --> 00:09:43.550
But honestly, how many of you
are sitting here thinking,

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:47.540
there's no way I can do
without my email inbox?

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:48.080
I like it.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.637
I use it as my to-do
list, et cetera.

00:09:50.637 --> 00:09:51.970
You have to see what I just saw.

00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:54.350
I saw a bunch of people
looking down and then

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.020
holding their hand up, like
I'm embarrassed to say.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:57.770
I'm with you, too.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:59.440
I can't find a way
to do without it.

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.150
But there are ways that
we can put buffers on it.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:06.200
There are other policies
besides zero-email.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.410
We have limited email,
which is saying that we only

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:09.510
email at certain times.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.890
So there's a dedicated
time for the email blitz,

00:10:11.890 --> 00:10:14.214
and then you focus in
on doing the deep work.

00:10:14.214 --> 00:10:15.630
And then there's
work hours email.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.300
One of my favorite
corporate examples

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.310
is a company literally shuts
the server off at 6:00 PM.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.910
So if you want to take your
laptop home with you, if you're

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.170
that person that everybody knows
who you are because you like

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:29.380
to email at 11:30
at night, you're

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.220
that person, that's
totally cool.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:33.990
We just won't get your emails
until 8:00 AM the next morning

00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:36.050
when the server comes back on.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:38.480
What all of these have
in common is two things--

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.900
the idea of allowing people
to design their workday

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.770
in a way that works for them.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.060
Email's an amazing
tool because it's cheap

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:45.990
and it's asynchronous.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.170
It's cheap to send, and
we send a lot of it.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:50.970
And it's asynchronous, so we
can send it whenever we want.

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.850
But what we don't
think about is the fact

00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.090
that that means people receive
it whenever we want to send it,

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:58.090
which means that it's
great that you can take it

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.280
and you can use it to
design your perfect workday,

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.655
but your perfect
workday butts up

00:11:01.655 --> 00:11:03.720
against other people's
ability to design

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.920
their perfect workday.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.010
And we've never had
this conversation.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.130
And you may begin to
become a champion for zero

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:11.450
or limited hours of work.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.230
That's honestly not the point.

00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:17.260
The point is we've never had
a conversation about what

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.110
is the right communication
tool for our project, what

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.510
is the right communication
tool for our team,

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.139
and then what are our
own individual limits?

00:11:25.139 --> 00:11:26.930
I've talked with a lot
of different people,

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:31.090
mostly subordinates who report
to a manager who likes to email

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.960
at 10:00, 11:00 at night.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.340
And even though they
know they don't have to,

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.870
there's always that
subtle pressure

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:38.930
that you have to
respond quickly.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.807
And we've never had that
open and frank conversation.

00:11:41.807 --> 00:11:44.140
So whether it's zero email,
whether it's outlawing email

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.430
entirely, or whether
it's actually

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.096
having a conversation
with your team of,

00:11:47.096 --> 00:11:49.710
hey, what is the best way to
communicate and collaborate,

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.940
which tool do we
want to use, we can

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.060
see a lot of
positive effects just

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:56.130
from taking a deep look
at how we collaborate,

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.300
how we communicate.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.310
I want to move into
one of my favorites.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.152
This comes from HCL
Technologies based out of India,

00:12:03.152 --> 00:12:05.110
but it's this idea of
putting customers second.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.510
Now, I know that
the Boston location

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.790
has a variety of the
sales team, a variety

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:14.836
of different Googlers,
and this idea in sales

00:12:14.836 --> 00:12:16.210
that the customer's
always right.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.550
How many of you
have ever said that?

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.060
How you ever been the
customer and invoked that?

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:19.707
That's when you hear it.

00:12:19.707 --> 00:12:22.248
Do you ever notice you always
hear it then, customer's always

00:12:22.248 --> 00:12:24.040
right when you're the customer?

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.260
And, of course, you pull
that line and somebody says

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:28.570
or somebody wants to
say in their head, like,

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.210
but you're totally
wrong in this instance,

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.850
but I have pretend
that you're right?

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:34.891
So what is this idea of
putting customers second?

00:12:34.891 --> 00:12:37.530
It's essentially this
idea that in order

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.760
to move customer
loyalty, you have

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.050
to look at what creates it.

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:43.020
It's not a goal.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.920
It's an effect, and we have
to look at what the cause is.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.110
Customer loyalty is created
inside of a value zone.

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:50.926
And to explain how
a value zone works,

00:12:50.926 --> 00:12:52.300
let's dive deep
on the org chart.

00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:53.490
And this isn't all that deep.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:55.198
It's actually only a
few boxes and lines.

00:12:55.198 --> 00:12:57.890
But already, you can visualize
what your own reporting

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.070
relationships have
ever looked like.

00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:01.950
What happens in almost
every company that

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:05.420
has ever been started has
a founder or founders.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.570
And as the organization scales,
generally those founders

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:10.840
move up through the ranks.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:13.210
So naturally, as you're
teaching other people

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:16.870
how to do what you used to
do and you now outsource

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.000
to another person, either inside
the company or outside of it,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.830
you want to keep that person
informed and accountable.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.360
So most org charts work that
way-- information flows down,

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.372
accountability flows up.

00:13:27.372 --> 00:13:29.830
The front line is accountable
to the management structures,

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:31.220
et cetera.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:33.370
And in HCL Technologies,
Vineet Nayar, the CEO,

00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:36.700
basically said, where's
the value being created,

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.736
because most of the
times in customer loyalty

00:13:38.736 --> 00:13:40.270
and in customer
satisfaction, the value's

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:41.978
not being created at
the place that we're

00:13:41.978 --> 00:13:43.290
holding people accountable to.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:46.780
So we created what he sort
of termed the value zone,

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.440
and the value zone was
that place where people

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.974
interact with the customer.

00:13:50.974 --> 00:13:53.140
If you're in a role that
interacts with the customer

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:55.370
or you have an activity that
interacts with the customer,

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.453
you are in the value zone.

00:13:56.453 --> 00:13:59.500
You're the one
creating the value.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.450
And so we have to think
about this information

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:03.630
and accountability thing as
it pertains to the value zone

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:05.713
because most of the time,
people in the value zone

00:14:05.713 --> 00:14:06.770
have a divided loyalty.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.670
The customer's
always right, but I

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.180
have to get my boss
whatever she needs.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:14.730
And that creates a divided
loyalty that can cause tension.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.432
And in some fields,
we've even seen it--

00:14:16.432 --> 00:14:18.473
I will not ask you to
raise your hand on this one

00:14:18.473 --> 00:14:21.120
because you may not want to--
but we've even seen situations

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.620
where in order to
please a customer,

00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.580
the person who used to
be serving that customer

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.600
is thrown under the bus
so the management can

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.740
come in and solve the problem.

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.610
And what does that
do future for wanting

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:31.870
to continue to
create value, wanting

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.161
to continue to serve customers?

00:14:33.161 --> 00:14:34.960
It doesn't really
help all that much.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.850
And so what HCL
did was essentially

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.050
turn their entire org
chart upside-down.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:40.930
They reversed that
accountability

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:43.250
and they built in
extra transparency.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.339
What reverse the
accountability means

00:14:45.339 --> 00:14:47.630
is they turned the org chart
upside-down and they said,

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.671
we in the management and
in the support functions

00:14:49.671 --> 00:14:51.120
are accountable
to the value zone.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.600
Wherever the value zone is
and as we change our business

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.990
model, wherever it goes, we need
to be accountable to it, even

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.280
to the point of creating a
customer service ticket system

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:01.600
for people in the value zone.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.837
So you're serving a customer.

00:15:02.837 --> 00:15:05.170
There is the normal sort of
customer complaint, customer

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.850
satisfaction ticket system.

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:09.132
They use a similar one
for I'm in the value zone

00:15:09.132 --> 00:15:11.090
and I need something and
I've got to figure out

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:12.191
where it comes from.

00:15:12.191 --> 00:15:13.690
We create a customer
support ticket.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.440
And only the person in the value
zone who created that ticket

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.700
can close it.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:20.140
And managers are actually
rated and bonused

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.729
on how well are
you serving these,

00:15:21.729 --> 00:15:23.520
how well are you closing
out these tickets,

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.940
how well are you getting
these people what they need.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.815
So it's this idea, again,
that accountability

00:15:26.815 --> 00:15:28.716
rests in the value zone.

00:15:28.716 --> 00:15:30.466
Transparency took a
real interesting form.

00:15:30.466 --> 00:15:35.040
And in the HR world, we love
to talk about 360 feedback.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:39.520
But what we usually mean by that
is manager, peers, and a couple

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.185
of hand-picked subordinates.

00:15:41.185 --> 00:15:42.560
They went a step
further and they

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.980
said that every single person
that interacts with you

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.820
has a right to give you
feedback and has a right

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.820
to see the feedback you're
getting from other places,

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.210
extending out this idea of
transparency of feedback,

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:56.280
extending out this
idea of accountability

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.550
to that value zone.

00:15:58.550 --> 00:16:00.260
And the results were
pretty incredible.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:03.640
I don't think you have
to dive too deep into it,

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:05.790
but I want to explain why
they were so incredible.

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:08.552
So we have, again, this
idea that customer loyalty

00:16:08.552 --> 00:16:10.760
is what we're striving for,
customer loyalty predicts

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.630
profitability.

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:14.060
And that's true--
increased market share,

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:18.160
increased profits are generally
tied into customer loyalty.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.290
But customer loyalty
is an effect.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:21.550
It's not a cause.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.600
It comes after certain
other conditions are met.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.320
Mainly, we have what we call
the service profit chain,

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.410
that customer loyalty
drives profits.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:30.050
We know this.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:32.360
Profits come from
customer loyalty.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.090
Customer loyalty
is most strongly

00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:36.429
predicted by employee
satisfaction.

00:16:36.429 --> 00:16:37.720
That's why the food is so good.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.090
It's most strongly predicted
by employee satisfaction,

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:42.590
and that's most strongly
predicted by designing your org

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.390
chart in a way to figure out
what that value zone is and put

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:46.210
those people first.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.110
And by the way, you
may not be able to do

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:49.760
this with an entire
organization,

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.500
but you can still do it in
whatever function you serve.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.000
Who is our customer
for our team?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.054
Who is our customer for
our broader department?

00:16:56.054 --> 00:16:57.720
How do we best serve
them, and how do we

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.595
make ourselves accountable
to the people that

00:16:59.595 --> 00:17:01.411
service that customer?

00:17:01.411 --> 00:17:02.910
And what I think
is most interesting

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:05.740
about this is this not an
idea that's all that new.

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:07.782
The service profit
chain has been around

00:17:07.782 --> 00:17:09.740
for a really long time,
developed by professors

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.573
who basically study on
the side of the river

00:17:11.573 --> 00:17:13.109
and on the other
side of the river.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:15.700
And we've been advocating
this for a long time.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:17.730
But often, people
aren't willing to take

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:20.109
that flip the org chart
mentality, that value zone

00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:21.839
mentality.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:24.400
And what I think HCL
provides us is an opportunity

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.130
to look at exactly
what happens when

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.786
we put that value zone first
and we say that, you know what?

00:17:28.786 --> 00:17:30.160
The customer may
always be right.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.340
But in order to make
the customer right,

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.340
we have to put our
own people first.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.660
And we see this in a couple
different companies throughout,

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.930
but there are sort of these
bright stars of employees

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:41.550
first.

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:44.091
One of my favorite ones is Danny
Meyer, founder of-- how many

00:17:44.091 --> 00:17:45.570
of you like Shake Shack?

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:46.990
Yes, yes, yes.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:48.340
Awesome.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.200
I was in New York
earlier this week

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.420
and was making a point to go to
every Union Square restaurant

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.644
that I could go to because
the service is amazing

00:17:55.644 --> 00:17:57.060
and I wanted to
see it for myself.

00:17:57.060 --> 00:17:58.768
Danny Meyer, the
founder of Union Square,

00:17:58.768 --> 00:18:01.530
basically says this about
the service-- he sums up

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:03.990
the service profit chain in
a restaurant-oriented quote--

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:05.448
"The interests of
our own employees

00:18:05.448 --> 00:18:07.817
must be placed directly
ahead of those of our guests

00:18:07.817 --> 00:18:10.150
because the only way we can
consistently earn raves, win

00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:13.120
repeat business, develop bonds
of loyalty with our guests

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.310
is to first ensure that
our own team members feel

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:17.220
jazzed about coming to work."

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:19.860
One of my other favorite
ones is from Howard Schultz

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.219
of Starbucks.

00:18:21.219 --> 00:18:23.593
Howard Schultz, if you're
unfamiliar the Starbucks story,

00:18:23.593 --> 00:18:26.951
you know that Howard Schultz
grew it to its notoriety

00:18:26.951 --> 00:18:29.450
and then stepped back from the
CEO role, just a new chairman

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:31.800
role, and a lot
of things changed.

00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.550
The changes were
subtle at first,

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.070
but you could
eventually taste them.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:37.697
And so Schultz
decided to come back,

00:18:37.697 --> 00:18:39.280
needed to turn the
stock price around.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.000
And so one of the biggest things
that a lot of the investors

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.790
were arguing for
was, Howard, you

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.266
can cut the health
insurance plan.

00:18:46.266 --> 00:18:48.140
You're trying to turn
the stock price around.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.850
Nobody will blame you for that.

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:51.865
They'll understand
that you need to do it.

00:18:51.865 --> 00:18:53.700
And he said, you know what?

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.630
You should probably
sell your stock

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:57.240
because we're not
going to do that.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.150
Why?

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:00.510
Because I do not believe
that shareholder value

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:02.470
is sustainable if you're
not creating value

00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:04.640
for the people who
are doing the work.

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:09.270
Again, we see business leaders
summarizing in their own ways

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.940
and in their own stories
a service profit chain

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.920
idea that's been around
for a really long time.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.461
It made me most
excited to see-- this

00:19:15.461 --> 00:19:18.220
is one of those ideas in the
book, again, that's not new,

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.830
but is an example
of what it means

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:23.410
to up-end business as usual.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:25.064
I asked a bunch of
different people

00:19:25.064 --> 00:19:26.980
which chapter in the
book I should talk about,

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.700
and they all said this one.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.701
And I was not planning
on talking about it,

00:19:31.701 --> 00:19:33.200
but I do think that
most people want

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.660
to hear either why their office
is amazing or why it's not.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.830
So shall we dive into it?

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:40.540
So does anybody
know, by curiosity,

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:43.791
where the trend towards
open offices started?

00:19:43.791 --> 00:19:44.290
No.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:46.130
You know why?

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.840
I'll give you where
it started, but we

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.760
like to conveniently forget
that it started here.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.340
It actually started
with Jay Chiat

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.180
and Chiat/Day advertising.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.790
If you've ever seen the famous
1984 commercial throwing

00:19:57.790 --> 00:19:59.586
the hammer through the
big brother screen,

00:19:59.586 --> 00:20:00.710
that was developed by them.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:02.560
And they had this
revolutionary idea

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.740
of creating the first open
office, totally nomadic office.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.710
You got a locker
and a laptop and you

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:10.680
got to find your own place.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:15.160
And it was a brilliant
idea in theory.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:16.980
And they spent
millions of dollars

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.980
transforming their office
space, and it became a disaster.

00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:21.750
My favorite stories
out of it is you

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:24.870
had people who would
arrive at work at 4:00 AM

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.450
and put their laptop
down to claim a desk

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:29.780
and then go back to their
car and sleep for a few hours

00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.360
so they could come back and
get their favorite place.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.440
You had people cramming
stuff into lockers

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.670
because you could have no,
like, tchotchkes whatsoever,

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:41.170
no personal flair,
no symbols of what

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:42.910
you were about in that space.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.510
You had to have
them in your locker.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.700
One woman couldn't
actually fit everything

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.800
she needed to do her
job in the locker.

00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.180
So she became known
as the red wagon lady

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.634
because she would pull
around a little red wagon

00:20:53.634 --> 00:20:54.550
with all of her stuff.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.130
This was before we started
doing those crates and the bags

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.310
with wheels and
whatever, which speaking

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:00.920
of innovative
products, I still don't

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:04.055
know why it took so long to
figure out wheels on bags.

00:21:04.055 --> 00:21:05.930
But this happened before
we figured that out,

00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:09.250
and she became the
little red wagon lady.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:12.120
What happens essentially
with the open office is this.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.296
First of all, there's
this whole conversation

00:21:14.296 --> 00:21:16.670
about whether or not people
are introverts and extroverts

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:17.890
and what they actually want.

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:20.080
And let me kill this
for you right now.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.040
Introversion and extroversion
is a sliding scale,

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.245
and every single person
is different on it.

00:21:25.245 --> 00:21:26.870
If you take a Big
Five test, you're all

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:27.730
going to get different numbers.

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.690
You're very rarely
placed into that box.

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:33.210
And so the idea that we
can find one perfect place

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:39.350
for you is foolish
because what you need

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:40.810
varies by the type
of work you do

00:21:40.810 --> 00:21:42.810
and how you would score on that.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.290
But even looking company-wide,
there's a balance,

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:46.990
there's a trade-off.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:52.130
The research in
favor of open offices

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.440
will say things like, oh,
it increases collaboration,

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.070
it increases creativity,
there's these serendipitous

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:58.520
experiences.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.810
And so it's for those benefits.

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:04.570
(WHISPERING) It helps that it's
a lot cheaper, let's just say.

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:06.330
But then on the
other side, we never

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:07.869
really talk about these studies.

00:22:07.869 --> 00:22:09.410
The studies show
that people are more

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:11.642
likely to experience
stress, especially where you

00:22:11.642 --> 00:22:12.600
sit in the open office.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:13.960
Have you ever
noticed if you've got

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.126
kind of open seating, people
gravitate towards being

00:22:16.126 --> 00:22:18.580
able to put their
back towards the wall?

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:20.790
That's pretty ancient
in human psychology

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:23.270
and human development,
this idea that we

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:25.049
need to be able to
see the whole room.

00:22:25.049 --> 00:22:25.590
And we do it.

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:27.798
And if you're one of the
people who doesn't get that,

00:22:27.798 --> 00:22:30.320
you're actually
experiencing more stress.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.060
In addition, there are
increases in distraction.

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:35.140
Some places have
tried to mitigate this

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:37.080
by having this sort
of earbud code.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.700
Two earbuds in means
don't talk to me.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.680
One means ask.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:41.840
Two means you can come up to me.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.880
Some of you are looking
at me like you've never

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:43.630
heard that before.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.810
Cool, that might be your
only takeaway from today.

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:46.780
That's awesome.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:47.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:49.770
And that might have just
super helped, right?

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:51.894
But we've come up with
that as a response

00:22:51.894 --> 00:22:54.310
to having to sort of cope with
the distraction factor that

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:55.500
happens in these offices.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.180
And then my favorite study shows
that people in an open office

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.600
floor plan are more likely
to call in sick to work

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.580
more often, which means they're
either legitimately sick more,

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.120
or they're sick of
their open office.

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.320
In either case,
again, it comes down

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:13.310
to having a broader conversation
about individual differences.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.720
And here's the challenge,
and here's the truth.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.720
The number one factor that
affects office environment--

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.000
it's not cool offices,
it's not free food,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.060
it's not funky design,
although I absolutely

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:26.170
love the T thing going
on in the elevators.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:27.510
That's awesome.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:31.152
But the number one factor
that affects employees,

00:23:31.152 --> 00:23:33.110
how environment affects
employees' performance,

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:35.720
is perceived control--
how much control

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:39.440
you have to move around, to
change your office as you work

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.962
there, and to adjust it to the
needs of when you're working

00:23:42.962 --> 00:23:45.170
with individuals, teams,
when you're doing deep work,

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:47.070
or when you need that
serendipity-- perceived

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:47.816
control.

00:23:47.816 --> 00:23:49.190
And so it's really
not a question

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:51.890
of closing open offices, opening
up closed offices, et cetera,

00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:53.264
but it's that idea
that we should

00:23:53.264 --> 00:23:55.140
start from the
assumption of what

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.110
do I need to do to give
my team perceived control?

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:00.420
I've been in a lot of
really beautiful offices

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.100
where people aren't even allowed
to change the number of picture

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.190
frames on their desk.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:08.540
What do you think that
does to perceived control?

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.030
And by the way, this ties in
with a huge stream of research

00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:12.370
around the importance
of autonomy.

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:14.380
If we're saying we want
to give people autonomy,

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:15.754
we want to give
people free time,

00:24:15.754 --> 00:24:19.240
we give people the ability to
control how they do their work

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:21.880
but we don't let them control
where they do their work,

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.090
then we're giving them false
promises about autonomy.

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:29.789
One of my favorite office
design, a lot of people

00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:31.330
have a lot of
different terms for it.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.940
My favorite term for it is
creating a palette of places,

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:37.450
creating a palette of
places where people can

00:24:37.450 --> 00:24:39.270
exert their perceived control.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:41.600
So a palette of places
looks like this--

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.540
you can go to your little
cafe in the front floor,

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:46.970
you can go to the long
tables where everybody

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:48.950
is, you can go to
your private corral,

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:50.850
you can book a meeting room.

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:53.530
Most of the time in the
service of perceived control,

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:56.470
there are more
seats than people.

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:57.200
Why?

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.140
Because, again, we want to
send the message of perceived

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.680
control, that you
are free to roam.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:02.680
How many of you
feel like you know

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:06.360
where you need to be when you're
doing certain types of work?

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.200
But to restrict you
to just one place

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.520
limits your ability to sort of
exert that perceived control.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.570
Some of the best offices
also organize around

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.380
what we call neighborhoods.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.450
So there are certain
departmental neighborhoods,

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.866
and you know you're most likely
to find the colleagues you

00:25:20.866 --> 00:25:21.770
need to find there.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:24.510
But you also know that
if they're not there,

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.440
presence and performance
aren't correlated.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.940
It doesn't mean
they're not working.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.148
It just means they're working
sort of somewhere else.

00:25:30.148 --> 00:25:32.580
We're putting it back in the
service of perceived control.

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:36.400
One more, one of my
favorites, is the perf.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.390
It's perf season, isn't it?

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:40.200
Yeah, so let's talk about this.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.520
Let's talk about the perf.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.580
I'll give you a very,
very brief story

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.050
of a hugely innovative
company that sort of ditched

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:48.310
the perf altogether,
that basically threw it

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:50.050
in the trashcan,
and that's Adobe.

00:25:50.050 --> 00:25:52.880
Adobe, as you know, has moved
from that sort of products

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:55.480
boxes on the shelf, the way you
used to have to get Photoshop,

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:58.150
to now Adobe Creative Cloud
and this idea of paying

00:25:58.150 --> 00:25:59.250
a subscription.

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:01.060
And it triggered a
conversation about what

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.040
are the other things
we're doing legacy

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.180
on a yearly cycle or a
six-month cycle, et cetera?

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:09.380
And they ended up taking a
deep look at their performance

00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:11.820
evaluations and deciding
to throw it in the trash.

00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.770
Some of you may be wanting to
throw your perf in the trash

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:14.320
right now.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.200
Others of you might like
it, and that's cool.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:20.260
And I can tell you why both of
you feel the exact same way.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.365
Why?

00:26:21.365 --> 00:26:23.990
In order to tell you why, let me
first tell you what Adobe did.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:26.830
They moved from the
performance appraisal system

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:28.700
to a system of
expectations, feedback,

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:30.950
and growth and development
that they called check-ins.

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:33.830
A check-in is any conversation--
can happen very frequently,

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:37.294
can happen every few
months, mostly happens

00:26:37.294 --> 00:26:39.210
sort of on a monthly or
every six weeks basis,

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:40.668
could take as little
as 10 minutes,

00:26:40.668 --> 00:26:42.400
can take as long as you want.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:44.400
And it's centered around
expectations, feedback,

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.525
and growth and development.

00:26:45.525 --> 00:26:47.070
Expectations--
setting, tracking,

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:49.080
reviewing what the
objectives are-- not only

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.140
what your objectives
are performance,

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:55.340
but what your expectations
for me are if I'm the manager.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.470
Feedback is the same
way-- giving and receiving

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:59.156
ongoing feedback and coaching.

00:26:59.156 --> 00:27:00.530
And then growth
and development--

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:01.529
where do you want to go?

00:27:01.529 --> 00:27:03.160
Talking about
opportunities-- how

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.234
does your role fit into
the broader spectrum,

00:27:05.234 --> 00:27:06.400
and where do you want to go?

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.210
What I think is great about the
check-in process is twofold,

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:12.550
and why it works is twofold.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:15.290
First, we have perspective.

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:20.430
We have this idea that
giving performance appraisals

00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:22.357
is vital, giving
feedback is vital,

00:27:22.357 --> 00:27:23.440
to increasing performance.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.370
And that's true, but most
places do on an annual basis

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:29.650
or a six-month basis.

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:31.460
And so most places
give that feedback.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:34.630
But imagine for a minute, like
the hypothetical example I use

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:38.110
is imagine you're a football
team and you play every Sunday.

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:39.780
And you're going to
play this Sunday,

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:42.720
but we're not going to tell you
the score for six months, when

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.309
we do your next perf.

00:27:44.309 --> 00:27:46.725
How likely is that you can
make course corrections easily?

00:27:46.725 --> 00:27:48.280
Not that likely.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.307
Feedback in the office
works the exact same way.

00:27:50.307 --> 00:27:52.890
The more frequently you can give
that perspective of feedback,

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:54.348
the more frequently
you can iterate

00:27:54.348 --> 00:27:56.470
towards better performance.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:58.260
So we might normally
do an annual review.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.660
Some places go to six months.

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:02.470
But these one-on-one
informal discussions

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:04.655
staged throughout
are hugely vital.

00:28:04.655 --> 00:28:06.530
Now, here's why I think
this is so important.

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:09.100
Even though I know
it's perf season,

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:12.957
is that I normally only get to
have the ear of people in HR

00:28:12.957 --> 00:28:15.290
when I make my case for
ditching performance appraisals.

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:17.250
But every single
person can learn

00:28:17.250 --> 00:28:20.500
from check-ins and one-on-one
informal discussions.

00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.260
If you remember nothing else
other than the earbuds thing,

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:26.100
maybe we can also add
on-- because by the way,

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.600
rule three of
speaking is you're not

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.599
supposed to say "if you
remember anything else,"

00:28:29.599 --> 00:28:31.880
so I'm going to leave
you with, like, four.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:36.930
So if you remember this, too--
expectations, feedback, growth

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:37.610
and development.

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:40.800
Even if you have to do the perf
every six months, if you can

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.556
every week, every two
weeks, every month,

00:28:42.556 --> 00:28:44.930
have a conversation that
centers around those things that

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:48.110
is frank and honest,
then when we arrive

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:50.940
at the next formal
appraisal cycle,

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.620
we arrive at a conversation
that doesn't surprise anyone,

00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.170
that doesn't create negotiations
over what your rank is

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:58.700
and what your label
is or any of that.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.820
We just arrive at
one more conversation

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:02.630
in an ever-continuous
improvement

00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:06.700
cycle of feedback, expectations,
and growth and development.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.890
So that's performance
appraisals.

00:29:08.890 --> 00:29:11.316
Overall, because I want to
get some time to questions.

00:29:11.316 --> 00:29:13.440
I knew lots of people begged
me for the open office

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.630
question, the perf
question, because that's

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.770
where we are, at least
among the ones I surveyed.

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:17.270
Who?

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:18.936
You're not allowed
to know who they are.

00:29:18.936 --> 00:29:20.840
It might affect them.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:24.669
But every time that I talk
about these ideas and every time

00:29:24.669 --> 00:29:26.710
that I talk about that
shift from industrial work

00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:29.690
to knowledge work and every
time I tell an HR or VP that you

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.410
should ditch
performance appraisals,

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:33.230
I get a very similar response.

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:36.060
I either get love it or loathe
it, love it or loathe it.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:39.126
And the loath-its always say,
we have no reason to change.

00:29:39.126 --> 00:29:40.500
What we're doing
here is working.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.160
What we're doing
here is working.

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:43.430
Why change?

00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:46.070
And every time I hear that,
I think about the same thing.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:48.570
I think about the internal
combustion engine.

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:49.070
Why?

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:53.046
Because I'm a nerd, but
also because actually this

00:29:53.046 --> 00:29:54.670
is one of the rare
times I can ask this

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:56.290
in the history of speaking.

00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:59.490
How many of you have studied
physics as an undergrad?

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:00.200
Yes.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.283
And what do you know about
the internal combustion

00:30:02.283 --> 00:30:04.850
engine and its ability to
take gasoline and transform it

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:06.283
into forward motion?

00:30:06.283 --> 00:30:09.270
It's thermodynamics.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:10.720
It's very inefficient.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:13.990
It is 30% efficient.

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:17.094
30% of the energy in
gasoline, in that fuel,

00:30:17.094 --> 00:30:19.010
gets actually transferred
into forward motion.

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:20.551
The rest is lost to
heat and friction

00:30:20.551 --> 00:30:24.040
and the rules of
thermodynamics-- 30% efficient.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.740
And yet we experiment
with a lot of ways

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.274
to make that more efficient.

00:30:27.274 --> 00:30:29.190
Whether that's putting
a new engine in the car

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:33.410
or making the car self-driving,
we continue to experiment.

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:34.800
The human engine
is no different.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:37.100
The organization
is no different.

00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.000
For most of us, the fuel
running most organizations

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.170
isn't brute labor and
it's not gasoline.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:44.450
It might be Red Bull,
but it's not gasoline.

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:46.299
It's mental energy.

00:30:46.299 --> 00:30:48.840
And when we talk about mental
energy, one of our best metrics

00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.900
for measuring efficiency is the
employee engagement metrics,

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.300
first made famous by Gallup.

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:55.254
But a variety of
different researchers

00:30:55.254 --> 00:30:56.670
use a variety of
different metrics

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:58.970
all to try and say how
much of our whole selves

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:01.220
are we bringing to work, how
much of our mental energy

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:03.110
are we bringing to
work, how many people

00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:04.610
inside our organization
are bringing

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:06.190
their whole selves to work?

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:11.050
And what we find is worldwide,
the number's about 18%.

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:14.420
It's worse than the
internal combustion engine.

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.757
In the US, it's about 30%.

00:31:16.757 --> 00:31:18.090
And I suspect here, it's higher.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:20.380
But I've never met an
organization that even takes it

00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:23.960
to 50%, meaning that 50% of
the time or 50% of the people

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:27.370
feel like they bring their
whole mental energy to work.

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:31.280
So why is it OK to continue
to experiment with an engine,

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.060
but it's not OK to
continue to experiment

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.360
with an organization?

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.520
And that's my central
idea around this thesis.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:40.200
What Frederick Taylor
did was he figured out

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.920
how to optimize for
brute force and how

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.860
to make it more efficient.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.080
And we drug a lot of
those principles with us

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.864
from the factory to the office.

00:31:48.864 --> 00:31:50.280
And suddenly now,
what we're doing

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.360
is working, so it's not to
continue to question it.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.720
The leaders, the entrepreneurs,
the corporate leaders,

00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.250
the researchers that I profile
in "Under New Management"

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:01.560
are all not satisfied
with the engine as usual.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.310
And honestly, not every
one of these ideas

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:04.810
works for every
single organization.

00:32:04.810 --> 00:32:07.030
But every single one of
them is an experiment.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:08.019
It's a moonshot.

00:32:08.019 --> 00:32:09.560
It's an attempt to
raise this number.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.380
And I'm not an optimist.

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:13.780
I don't believe that
we can get to 100%

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:17.717
on the whatever is slightly less
depressed than an optimist--

00:32:17.717 --> 00:32:19.800
I'm not a pessimist, but
whatever is slightly less

00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:21.270
depressed than an optimist.

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:25.390
I don't believe that we can
get that number up to 100%.

00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:27.510
But, god, if we
could get it to 50%?

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:29.580
If most Americans had
a coin-flip chance

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:33.020
of finding a job that engaged
them, that'd be amazing.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:33.720
I have two sons.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.290
They're four and they're two.

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:38.340
And this is honestly
what drives me

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:42.340
around this, is that
I'm thinking about 15,

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:45.090
20 years from now
where they go to work,

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:47.660
can we change the engine
and get it to the point

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:52.000
where they have a coin-flip
chance of being engaged?

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.770
Even an organization
that lots of people

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:56.270
like to write about, like
Google, that you know people

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:57.750
who are not bringing their
whole selves to work,

00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:58.499
can we experiment?

00:32:58.499 --> 00:33:00.010
Can we change these ideas?

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:02.640
Can we play around with
new modes and methods

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.650
to raise this number up?

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:06.490
Great leaders don't
innovate the product,

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:08.439
they innovate the factory.

00:33:08.439 --> 00:33:09.980
So let's turn our
conversation to how

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:11.730
we can innovate
the factory and let

00:33:11.730 --> 00:33:14.390
that be the huge
surge that proceeds

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:16.020
a wave of product innovation.

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:16.900
We can get there.

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:17.460
We can.

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:20.120
It just takes continued
experimentation.

00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.210
Great leaders don't
innovate the product,

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:24.250
they innovate the factory.

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:26.484
That said, what questions
do you have about how

00:33:26.484 --> 00:33:27.400
we innovate a factory?

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.870
AUDIENCE: So on the
open floor plan issue,

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:37.210
the book "Making Software"
cites sociology studies that

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:40.940
were put together on open
offices versus closed offices.

00:33:40.940 --> 00:33:44.170
And it basically came down to if
the task was an individual sort

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:45.810
of task, closed doors help.

00:33:45.810 --> 00:33:49.270
If it's a collaborative task,
then having open space helps.

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:51.980
Why do you cite it as just
individual preference?

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:54.230
DAVID BURKUS: So I think
it's a combination of things.

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:56.090
I definitely think
it's the type of work.

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:57.839
And most people, I
don't think you can say

00:33:57.839 --> 00:33:59.877
do one type of work one way.

00:33:59.877 --> 00:34:01.960
So I think there's a human
psychology piece, which

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.501
is individual
differences, and then I

00:34:03.501 --> 00:34:05.750
think there's the type
of work that people do.

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:08.471
But then even if you combine,
like you times those two

00:34:08.471 --> 00:34:09.929
by each other and
you have a factor

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:12.155
a variety of different
things-- like I,

00:34:12.155 --> 00:34:14.280
because my training's in
organizational psychology,

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.159
tend to lean towards that side.

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:19.100
But the type of work being
done also influences it.

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:22.280
But there's a confounding factor
of how an individual likes

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.634
to do that type of work.

00:34:23.634 --> 00:34:24.300
So I'm a writer.

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.258
And I know people that
love to write in solace,

00:34:26.258 --> 00:34:28.580
and I know people that will
deliberately go to a cafe

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:30.460
in order to write with all
sorts of noise around them--

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.460
same type of work, but
the individual difference

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.100
is sort of also a
confounding factor in it.

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:41.010
AUDIENCE: Should we focus more
on what environment fails less

00:34:41.010 --> 00:34:42.940
for the opposite task
when it comes up,

00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:45.674
and not the obvious fact
that open offices are better

00:34:45.674 --> 00:34:47.340
for collaboration and
closed offices are

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:50.800
better for independent work?

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.562
DAVID BURKUS: I side on the side
of perceived control, like I

00:34:53.562 --> 00:34:55.520
think when we need to
think about how we design

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.860
a whole place, we need
to know that there's

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.870
a ton of different types of
work and a ton of different ways

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:00.578
that people like to
do that type of work.

00:35:00.578 --> 00:35:02.260
And so that palette
of places approach

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.160
gives perceived control
over to the person.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.430
It gives them the
individual idea.

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:09.160
That does mean we have to have
a conversation about how you can

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.530
know whether or not you're being
productive because sometimes we

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.155
might feel like we're
being productive,

00:35:13.155 --> 00:35:15.750
but we're actually being
distracted often-- see email

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:16.816
as an example.

00:35:16.816 --> 00:35:18.190
But I think, again,
it comes down

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:19.856
to that idea of
designing the place that

00:35:19.856 --> 00:35:21.570
works for a variety
of different means

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:25.820
and then just setting people
free to kind of figure it out.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.879
AUDIENCE: So performance--

00:35:27.879 --> 00:35:28.670
DAVID BURKUS: Yeah.

00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:29.910
AUDIENCE: We all hate it.

00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:30.910
And one of the reasons--

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:31.840
DAVID BURKUS:
Performance appraisals.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.955
AUDIENCE: Performance
appraisals,

00:35:32.955 --> 00:35:33.865
not high performance.

00:35:33.865 --> 00:35:35.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:35.650
DAVID BURKUS: I
was going to say,

00:35:35.650 --> 00:35:37.520
I think I'm in the wrong
room if that's the case.

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.394
AUDIENCE: Perf, perf.

00:35:38.394 --> 00:35:39.750
DAVID BURKUS: Perf, right.

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:40.910
AUDIENCE: We all hate it.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:42.899
And one of the
reasons I hate it is--

00:35:42.899 --> 00:35:45.190
DAVID BURKUS: You're saying
this on camera, by the way.

00:35:45.190 --> 00:35:47.130
I was deliberately not asking
questions about this one.

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:47.490
AUDIENCE: That's fine.

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:47.810
DAVID BURKUS: No, no.

00:35:47.810 --> 00:35:48.760
Go for it.

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.820
AUDIENCE: There's a
tension between being

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.710
honest and playing the game.

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:57.210
So when I'm talking
to my boss, I really

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:58.880
don't want to tell
him, you know what?

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.700
Monday and Tuesday this
week, I got nothing done.

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:05.190
And I'm in a bad mood,
and I hate my co-worker.

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:07.610
And by the way, you made
a stupid mistake yesterday

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:11.220
at the meeting, which completely
derailed, blah, blah, blah.

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.400
Do I really want to
say things like that?

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.500
And how is the continuous
process any better?

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:22.727
My boss is not my therapist, and
can influence my career, right?

00:36:22.727 --> 00:36:23.560
DAVID BURKUS: Right.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:25.820
AUDIENCE: So how do you
deal with this tension

00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.660
between honesty and a
productive feedback?

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:32.604
DAVID BURKUS: So the first
challenge is, other than--

00:36:32.604 --> 00:36:34.770
and actually, your comment
reminded me of that scene

00:36:34.770 --> 00:36:36.640
in "Office Space" where he
describes what he does and he's

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.098
like, I get to work
and I just kind

00:36:38.098 --> 00:36:39.976
of stare at the wall
for, like, 15 minutes.

00:36:39.976 --> 00:36:42.226
So you don't want to admit
that, although he admits it

00:36:42.226 --> 00:36:44.100
and he gets promoted.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:47.751
The things that you said my boss
doesn't kind of want to hear,

00:36:47.751 --> 00:36:49.250
part of him doesn't
want to hear it.

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:53.339
Part of him needs to hear it,
or part of her needs to hear it.

00:36:53.339 --> 00:36:55.380
And so it begins from that
place of understanding

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:58.616
that these sessions aren't
necessary be used to label.

00:36:58.616 --> 00:37:00.490
They're to be used to
have that conversation,

00:37:00.490 --> 00:37:02.150
and it takes an
openness at that level

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:03.820
to actually hear that feedback.

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:04.920
Now, for some people,
it takes a lot

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.461
of training to get
them to that point

00:37:06.461 --> 00:37:09.297
where they're sort of open
to hearing that feedback.

00:37:09.297 --> 00:37:11.130
One of my writer friends
say teaching people

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.588
how to hug their haters so they
can actually learn and grow

00:37:13.588 --> 00:37:14.230
from it.

00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:17.330
The biggest thing is the lack
of formality of the event.

00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:19.940
I think what causes
a lot of the stress

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.800
and the playing the
game that you said

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.650
is that it eventually gets
documented, goes in a file.

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:26.640
And so it's very
careful about what

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.800
goes in the file, what
doesn't go in the file.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:33.240
And a lot of times, it'll take
some time to ramp up to it.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.720
But when you can
sort of actually

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:36.261
get people to believe
that, no, we're

00:37:36.261 --> 00:37:38.310
having an open, honest
conversation, none of it's

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:39.726
getting written
down, none of it's

00:37:39.726 --> 00:37:41.930
going in a file,
let's just talk,

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:44.044
gradually people start
to lower their guard.

00:37:44.044 --> 00:37:45.460
It will not happen
the first time.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:47.540
Like I said, I'm one
step below optimism.

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.280
Whatever is one step less
pessimistic than an optimist,

00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:51.150
I'm that.

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:52.740
So it won't happen right away.

00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:54.640
But the hope is that
if we shift to that

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:57.541
and we really get people
to believe that these are

00:37:57.541 --> 00:37:59.790
informal conversations,
they're not going in the file,

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:01.954
they're just about how do
we get you what you need,

00:38:01.954 --> 00:38:03.370
then we can actually
move towards.

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:07.880
AUDIENCE: As a fairly quick
followup, we do have procedures

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:10.700
here where you can ask
for advice from someone

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:14.830
outside your management
chain, which I haven't taken

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:17.350
advantage of enough, I'm sure.

00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:20.080
Does it make sense
for the same person

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:24.300
to be managing you day-to-day
and evaluating you and getting

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.450
honest feedback?

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:28.130
Are those all the same role?

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:29.630
DAVID BURKUS: It varies a lot.

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:31.830
So one of the
chapters that, which

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:34.312
I didn't go into it today, but
one of the chapters we have

00:38:34.312 --> 00:38:36.520
in "Under New Management"
is about the companies that

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.054
really do fire the manager.

00:38:38.054 --> 00:38:39.470
And then there are
other companies

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:41.400
to try and do it and find
that they need a management

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:41.760
structure.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.260
And it comes down to there are
certain roles in management

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:46.410
in every organization
based on the type of work

00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:49.484
and the culture can decide
who best does those role.

00:38:49.484 --> 00:38:51.650
And sometimes, they decide
the team works it better,

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:52.762
the peers do it better.

00:38:52.762 --> 00:38:54.970
Sometimes they decide that
management does it better.

00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:55.790
But you're absolutely right.

00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:58.270
One of the things I love
about in the accountability

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:01.567
piece around doing
360 for management

00:39:01.567 --> 00:39:03.650
was that idea that everybody
who's interacted your

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:05.210
throughout the year
has that ability

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:08.410
to leave you feedback, which
I think it's hard, again,

00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:10.490
do that in an
informal conversation.

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:12.829
That said, the hope
and the assumption

00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:14.870
is that your manager and
the people on your team,

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:16.411
the people who work
closest with you,

00:39:16.411 --> 00:39:18.970
are the most invested in
your long-term success,

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:20.590
your long-term performance.

00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:22.500
And so because of that
emotional investment,

00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:24.790
they're probably the best one to
have the informal conversation

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:25.540
with.

00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:26.680
But you're absolutely
right, most of us

00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:29.000
work with people who are
not technically on our team,

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.833
and we still collaborate
with them at times.

00:39:30.833 --> 00:39:32.450
And that data isn't
really getting

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:33.971
captured in a very good system.

00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:36.220
Some of that's the nature
of the beast, and some of it

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:38.700
is we shouldn't
allow it to happen.

00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:39.922
We should spread it out.

00:39:39.922 --> 00:39:40.630
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:41.739
DAVID BURKUS: Thank you.

00:39:41.739 --> 00:39:42.280
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.930
So thank you for the talks.

00:39:43.930 --> 00:39:46.362
So staying on this
topic, so getting rid

00:39:46.362 --> 00:39:47.820
of performance
evaluations-- I want

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:49.920
to look under the cover
of that a little bit.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.170
DAVID BURKUS: Everybody
wants-- it's the right season.

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:53.440
AUDIENCE: It reminds
me of politicians

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:55.160
who say that we should get
rid of the Internal Revenue

00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:55.660
Service.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.490
That sound
superficially appealing.

00:39:57.490 --> 00:40:01.310
But at the end of the day, those
things still need to get done.

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:05.482
And so in my past many
years of being a manager,

00:40:05.482 --> 00:40:07.440
I've come to realize that
a lot of this process

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:09.440
is not about torturing
the individual employees.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:12.500
It's really about forcing
managers to do the right thing.

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.860
So without things like
curves, for example,

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:18.800
you'll have lazy managers who
give everyone the same score.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.410
They're conflict-averse, or
they'll just give the bennies

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:22.800
to their friends or whatever.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.039
And so we need sort of
the managers' managers

00:40:25.039 --> 00:40:27.330
kind of structure to make
sure the right things happen.

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:28.570
And that has to happen,
anyway, I think.

00:40:28.570 --> 00:40:30.650
So to me, it feels
like a false dichotomy.

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:32.900
It's not really get rid of
the performance evaluation,

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.420
it's really you need both.

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.670
A good manager should be
doing those other things

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:38.890
all the time, anyway.

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:40.390
But you still need
a formal process.

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:42.860
You still need a process
to compare people

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:43.740
in an objective way.

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:46.300
You still need to decide
about promotions and raises

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:49.552
and who was not performing
and so on and so forth.

00:40:49.552 --> 00:40:50.260
DAVID BURKUS: No.

00:40:50.260 --> 00:40:51.780
And so in general, I agree.

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:54.240
So there's a teeny bit of
hyperbole to get rid of the IRS

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.372
because it's always if
deep down, we're going

00:40:56.372 --> 00:40:57.580
to replace it with something.

00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.310
Or it's not, and
hopefully that person

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:02.120
doesn't get a
plurality of the vote.

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:06.770
But so it's always a
situation where you're

00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:08.000
replacing it with something.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.520
In this case, I love
the Adobe example

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.936
because what they
replaced it with

00:41:10.936 --> 00:41:14.092
was we're going to get
rid of this formal system.

00:41:14.092 --> 00:41:16.050
And one of the things I
sort of didn't roll out

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:18.175
is we're going to replace
it with coaching managers

00:41:18.175 --> 00:41:19.757
and have these
conversations, when

00:41:19.757 --> 00:41:22.090
to have these conversations,
a lot of different training

00:41:22.090 --> 00:41:22.846
on it.

00:41:22.846 --> 00:41:24.720
And that can only really
happen in a culture,

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.300
too, that reinforces
those ideas--

00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.000
that feedback, that
evaluation, that

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.170
keeping track of who
needs what in order to be

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:33.841
ready for promotions, et
cetera, is hugely important.

00:41:33.841 --> 00:41:36.090
So you can't just sort of
strip it, you're absolutely.

00:41:36.090 --> 00:41:38.690
What you can do is train
that informal system.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:41.760
But it does take-- and honestly,
it takes a lot more work

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.310
than just saying, well,
we do perf for six months,

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:46.390
we do an annual
review, whatever.

00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:49.720
That's the way to accomplish
the objective with less

00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.320
energy than does this?

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.496
But the ROI on this is
significantly better,

00:41:54.496 --> 00:41:56.870
I believe, because you're
training people on how to do it

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:58.570
and you're giving
it more frequently.

00:41:58.570 --> 00:41:59.990
AUDIENCE: We can
certainly imagine

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:01.830
it's the throwing the baby
out with the bathwater

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:04.371
kind of thing, where you go too
far, basically, and have to--

00:42:04.371 --> 00:42:05.500
DAVID BURKUS: Absolutely.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:06.000
No.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.975
And in general, I
think that's what

00:42:07.975 --> 00:42:10.350
the conversation I see in
management that hasn't happened

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:12.710
that should is that, as I
said before, we drug a lot

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:15.070
of Taylorism with us from
the factory to the office.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.020
And we never really had a
conversation about what parts

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.100
of it we should use and
what parts we shouldn't.

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.612
And as the nature of work
evolves, a lot of it's

00:42:21.612 --> 00:42:22.820
going to fall by the wayside.

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:25.550
But that doesn't mean we
have to stop doing it.

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:28.420
It means we have to say, what
does management look like?

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:29.740
How do we innovate the factory?

00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:31.572
We can't just let
it be free-range,

00:42:31.572 --> 00:42:32.530
but how do we innovate?

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:33.655
What do we replace it with?

00:42:33.655 --> 00:42:34.660
Absolutely.

00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:35.160
Hi.

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:35.720
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.714
So to expand upon
that, in addition

00:42:37.714 --> 00:42:39.130
to what does
management look like,

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:41.080
I think you said every
time you present it

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.402
to HR, the responses--

00:42:42.402 --> 00:42:44.110
DAVID BURKUS: Well,
love it or loathe it.

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:44.830
But yeah, yeah.

00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:45.496
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:42:45.496 --> 00:42:49.300
So what would your vision
be for a sort of future HR,

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.710
because I feel like we've had
lots of innovation and lots

00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:54.950
of different industries,
but HR is pretty consistent.

00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:57.330
And at Google, it's a
little bit different.

00:42:57.330 --> 00:42:59.910
But very few HR have
come from actually

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:02.370
doing the work in
the individual roles,

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:04.680
and yet they're
part of evaluating.

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:07.027
So how does that need
to evolve to support?

00:43:07.027 --> 00:43:09.360
And what does that look like
at Adobe, if you can share?

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.887
DAVID BURKUS: So you actually
pointed to my favorite thing

00:43:11.887 --> 00:43:14.470
that has to change right off the
bat, which is the idea that--

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:18.300
twofold-- the idea that you can
be in HR or People Operations

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.280
without having
been anywhere else,

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:23.930
but also that you can get
very high in the organization

00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:26.310
in most companies all the
way up to the senior levels

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:28.880
without ever having
done a stint in HR.

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:32.370
And I think we need to see
that as one other path or one

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:33.830
other stop in a
path that is vital

00:43:33.830 --> 00:43:35.850
not just for people to
start somewhere else

00:43:35.850 --> 00:43:37.762
and migrate to HR,
but also if they're

00:43:37.762 --> 00:43:39.720
wanting to migrate up
through the organization,

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.100
to do it through
HR for that reason.

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.310
I think there needs
to be a broader

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:44.800
conversation about the type
of work, what that requires.

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:48.130
And my hope is that that would
change the culture for most

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:49.610
organizations.

00:43:49.610 --> 00:43:51.670
And true or not true to
that value zone concept,

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:54.020
for most organizations,
HR or People Operations

00:43:54.020 --> 00:43:54.980
is an overhead.

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:56.510
It doesn't really
create that value.

00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:58.530
Yet at the same
time, if our people

00:43:58.530 --> 00:44:01.160
create all of our value, then
the conversations about what

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.690
are the developmental
needs of our people, who

00:44:02.690 --> 00:44:05.100
are the ones that are
performing stronger than others,

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:07.240
those things are vital to
continue to create value.

00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.970
So my hope is-- HR will
use the term "we hope

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:11.250
we have a seat at the table."

00:44:11.250 --> 00:44:12.890
But I also hope they
get up from their table

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:15.140
and go and sit down at other
departmental tables, too.

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.634
I think we start
there, if we can.

00:44:17.634 --> 00:44:18.921
Thank you.

00:44:18.921 --> 00:44:19.420
Hi.

00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:19.961
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:44:19.961 --> 00:44:23.400
Different subject-- I'm
interested very much

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:26.050
in your thoughts
on Managed by Q. I

00:44:26.050 --> 00:44:28.450
don't know whether you'd
be willing to say too much

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:30.340
about a particular company.

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:32.860
But in their case, it
seems quite unique.

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:36.660
And also, I think it's probably
the most radical attempt

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:40.430
out there to innovate the
factory that's going on.

00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:46.250
And I'm wondering if you think
they can possibly succeed

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:47.710
and whether they
can possibly have

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:52.440
an impact on the whole outsource
service industry that we have.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.510
I assume you know what
I'm talking about.

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:57.230
DAVID BURKUS: So Managed by
Queue as in, like, Q-U-E--

00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:58.900
AUDIENCE: No, Q. Q as in--

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.191
DAVID BURKUS: As in the letter?

00:45:00.191 --> 00:45:03.750
AUDIENCE: Q, the James Bond
guy who did all that stuff.

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:06.670
Managed by Q. Sorry to
have to explain this.

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:09.830
I thought you of all people
would be totally up on this.

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:12.580
But Managed by Q
is a company that

00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:15.310
is in the service industry.

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:22.530
And instead of having the model
of having the absolute lowest

00:45:22.530 --> 00:45:25.280
wages, benefits,
whatever out there,

00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:28.610
they are competing with
cleaning companies, companies

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:32.360
that go into offices in
cities and do cleaning

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:36.290
and that have the absolute
lowest wages, benefits, hire

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:39.770
the most immigrants, the
whole thing-- these guys have

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:41.390
a totally different model.

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:43.280
They pay their employees well.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.820
They have health insurance.

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:49.810
More importantly, they
have more management type

00:45:49.810 --> 00:45:51.270
responsibilities.

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:53.660
And they're encouraged
to interact directly

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:56.510
with their clients
in the building.

00:45:56.510 --> 00:46:00.770
It's a totally different
model of how a company can

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:02.780
do a service industry.

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:07.010
If they succeed, which is
really the big question,

00:46:07.010 --> 00:46:11.580
that model threatens to
completely revolutionize

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:16.160
the whole model of how
service industries in general

00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:17.740
have developed in this country.

00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:22.110
This is a massively important
thing that's going on here.

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:22.740
Sorry.

00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:23.990
DAVID BURKUS: No, no know, no.

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:27.656
So admittedly, this is
me being the [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:27.656 --> 00:46:30.120
of psychologists that always
love to see a lot of data.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.860
Admittedly, my jury's
still out on that.

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:33.630
There are things to what you
just described that I really

00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:36.213
like, especially the idea of the
interaction with client piece

00:46:36.213 --> 00:46:37.690
and the idea, again,
of taking care

00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:39.430
of people who are
in that value zone

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:43.290
and knowing that that's
where value is created.

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:45.390
I tend to reserve
judgment, passing judgment,

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:48.529
on things like that because
I'm not good at forecasting.

00:46:48.529 --> 00:46:50.070
I'm trained as a
psychologist, so I'm

00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:51.270
only good at looking
back and going,

00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:52.640
huh, this seems to predict this.

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:55.229
So often, I get a
similar question often

00:46:55.229 --> 00:46:57.270
around, like, Holacracy
and those sort of things.

00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:00.070
And I just think, like,
let's ride this one out.

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:03.530
I can see arguments for
it, arguments against it.

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:05.050
And as it scales,
I think we'll have

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:08.060
a better idea of where we can
go and forming an opinion on it.

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:09.620
I know that's sort
of a non-answer.

00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:10.760
And I know it's
political season,

00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.280
so we're all attuned
to non-answers.

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.120
But I honestly prefer
to keep my jury still

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.230
deliberating on that one.

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.980
AUDIENCE: It's OK.

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:19.410
It's definitely an experiment.

00:47:19.410 --> 00:47:20.370
DAVID BURKUS: Yeah.

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:22.490
AUDIENCE: The guy behind
it is totally seriously.

00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:24.550
He has a profit model
that he'll explain

00:47:24.550 --> 00:47:26.330
to you and the whole thing.

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:28.724
Whether it will succeed,
I don't really know.

00:47:28.724 --> 00:47:30.390
But it's gotten a lot
of press recently,

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:31.850
so I'm going to
definitely look into it.

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:34.480
DAVID BURKUS: And I'll say one
other thing towards that, which

00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:38.400
is that there's a tendency
among a lot of different people

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.640
to say this is the
way to do it, we're

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:43.410
going to write the operating
system for management,

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:44.280
et cetera.

00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.290
And the challenge
is that in general,

00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:49.025
as the nature of work
changes, every organization

00:47:49.025 --> 00:47:51.150
needs something slightly
different from management.

00:47:51.150 --> 00:47:53.780
And then as the people who come
into the organization change,

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:55.571
we have, again, that
individual differences

00:47:55.571 --> 00:47:57.990
versus the type of
work thing, the needs

00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:59.895
of every individual
management change.

00:47:59.895 --> 00:48:01.460
I know a lot of
different people who

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:04.450
have promoted their model of
this is how we should do it.

00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:06.670
I don't have a four-box
model and that type of thing.

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:08.957
I just have here are the
ideas and the experiments.

00:48:08.957 --> 00:48:11.290
But every company has to
wrestle with how we apply this.

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:12.510
I think maybe we have
time for about one more.

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:14.710
I'm getting the time
of day notifications.

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:15.200
AUDIENCE: Great, thanks.

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.420
DAVID BURKUS: And we
can chat afterwards.

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:17.600
I definitely want to chat.

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:19.920
AUDIENCE: Bruce [INAUDIBLE],
and I work in design.

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:21.866
And I have a sort of--
it's a two-question,

00:48:21.866 --> 00:48:24.240
so you could pick up either
one or depending on the time.

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.314
But there's a conventional
systems question

00:48:26.314 --> 00:48:27.980
of how the pieces fit
together, and then

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.540
maybe an unconventional
question.

00:48:29.540 --> 00:48:31.764
The conventional part
is I was curious,

00:48:31.764 --> 00:48:33.680
have you thought about
the way different kinds

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:34.840
of managements intersect?

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:38.350
So there's the people management
that you're describing--

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:39.845
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:48:39.845 --> 00:48:41.410
Project, product, operations.

00:48:41.410 --> 00:48:43.150
And then the second
part of the question

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:45.390
is what about if there's AI?

00:48:45.390 --> 00:48:47.625
So if you submit jobs
out to Mechanical Turk,

00:48:47.625 --> 00:48:49.500
it could be a person,
it could be a computer.

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.680
Does this mean we
should be finding ways

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:54.890
to use the techniques that
would work also for computers?

00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:56.360
Or does it mean
that we should find

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.020
ways to take what
we've learned and apply

00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:01.380
it people, or any thoughts?

00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:02.530
DAVID BURKUS: Wow.

00:49:02.530 --> 00:49:04.490
I knew I'd get
awesome questions.

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:06.160
So admittedly, the
second one, I'm

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.240
probably going to be thinking
about the entire plane ride

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:08.740
home.

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:09.710
AUDIENCE: Nice.

00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:12.790
DAVID BURKUS: So then I
can't say I'll email you

00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:14.590
because-- but--

00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:17.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] was here
two weeks ago in Cambridge,

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:19.530
and they have Amy, or Angie.

00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:22.540
Apparently people only ask Amy
to set up their lunch dates.

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:25.920
But the founder
said that people are

00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:27.170
treating the AI like a person.

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:29.430
So it would be, Amy, would
you please set this up?

00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:32.740
And so will it be important
to review the software?

00:49:32.740 --> 00:49:35.054
If we were to issue
review of the software,

00:49:35.054 --> 00:49:37.470
would that also then affect
the way that we review people?

00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:39.642
Are we treating
people like machines,

00:49:39.642 --> 00:49:41.600
and because we're treating
machine like people?

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.930
DAVID BURKUS: So
this is me being

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:45.910
my favoritist towards humans.

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:49.550
I would imagine as we're
designing an AI system,

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:51.950
we're going to try and
design it most like ours.

00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:55.882
And then whoever's designing it
gets to fix a few of our flaws.

00:49:55.882 --> 00:49:58.340
And that's the thing that we
honestly have to wrestle with.

00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:00.890
So to answer the first question
around people, operation,

00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:04.340
project, management-- as
we shift from physical work

00:50:04.340 --> 00:50:08.100
to idea work, as everything
that can be outsourced

00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:11.989
to lesser intelligent, robotics,
Ken is given to them-- not AI

00:50:11.989 --> 00:50:14.030
but just to straight
robotics, because that's all

00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:16.740
outsourced-- our roles become
more and more about ideas.

00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:18.823
And ideas are still
generated, at least right now,

00:50:18.823 --> 00:50:20.200
by our brains.

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.430
And so I think we start
there and we tie it back

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:24.860
to people because even in a
project management system,

00:50:24.860 --> 00:50:28.300
a lot of the contextual
variables are on people.

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:30.210
So in my own-- I don't
want to give too much

00:50:30.210 --> 00:50:31.710
into my own things,
but I'm actually

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:33.800
dealing with an operations
management issue

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:35.980
now that was a result
of still a person.

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:37.230
So I think we start there.

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:39.640
On the broader AI
question, I think

00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:43.094
it'd be really interesting to
see how much AI psychology--

00:50:43.094 --> 00:50:44.760
this will be a
department in the future,

00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:48.350
it's like AI psychology--
how much that mind mirrors

00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:51.580
our own mind and what
quirks made the transfer

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:52.829
and what quirks we fixed for.

00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:54.870
And then we have to, again,
think about how do we

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:56.440
innovate the factory for that?

00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:58.022
That's fascinating, though.

00:50:58.022 --> 00:50:59.480
You just ruined my
in-flight movie.

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:01.720
But that's OK.

00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.640
I really do believe
because we're modeling it

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.835
after the human mind, but
trying to make it better,

00:51:05.835 --> 00:51:07.960
so we'll keep some things,
we'll drop other things,

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.140
and then we've got to do
the study all over again.

00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:11.062
Yeah, fascinating.

00:51:11.062 --> 00:51:11.770
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:13.130
DAVID BURKUS: Well,
in the meantime,

00:51:13.130 --> 00:51:14.600
thank you all so
much for having me.

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:16.290
I knew I would get questions
that, again, would ruin

00:51:16.290 --> 00:51:18.000
my in-flight movie
because I'll be thinking

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.083
about them the whole time.

00:51:19.083 --> 00:51:20.687
So that's awesome.

00:51:20.687 --> 00:51:23.020
I'll linger and chat if there
are any further questions.

00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:25.860
If there are not, great leaders
don't innovate the product,

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:27.150
they innovate the factory.

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:29.600
And whether these ideas
resonated with you or they just

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.266
sparked new ones
because you're thinking

00:51:31.266 --> 00:51:33.200
about innovate the
factory of your team,

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:35.024
of your workplace,
et cetera, I hope

00:51:35.024 --> 00:51:36.690
we keep that conversation
going and keep

00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:39.110
thinking about how we
innovate our new idea factory.

00:51:39.110 --> 00:51:41.410
So thank you all so
much for having me.

00:51:41.410 --> 00:51:44.460
[APPLAUSE]
