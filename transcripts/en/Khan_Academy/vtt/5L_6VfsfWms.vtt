00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.882
- [Narrator] Although the
Spanish were the first

00:00:02.882 --> 00:00:05.677
European colonists in the New World,

00:00:05.677 --> 00:00:09.258
they didn't remain alone in
the Americas for very long.

00:00:09.258 --> 00:00:13.425
Just three years after Hernan
Cortes captured Tenochtitlan,

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.100
the French government
sent its first explorer

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.933
to poke around North America

00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:25.353
and look for what many European explorers

00:00:25.353 --> 00:00:27.228
had searched for from the beginning,

00:00:27.228 --> 00:00:29.061
a passage to the East.

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:32.399
Now, although the explorers never found

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.471
this Northwest passage
because it didn't exist,

00:00:35.471 --> 00:00:37.542
they, like the Spanish, quickly learned

00:00:37.542 --> 00:00:40.542
that there were quite a
lot of riches to be had

00:00:40.542 --> 00:00:42.334
in the Americas themselves.

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:45.338
In this video, I'd like to
take some time to talk about

00:00:45.338 --> 00:00:49.395
two of the lesser known European
colonies in the New World,

00:00:49.395 --> 00:00:51.562
New France up here in pink

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:58.826
and New Netherland, this
little orange dot right here.

00:01:01.608 --> 00:01:05.775
Now, you can see that compared
to the extent of New Spain,

00:01:08.858 --> 00:01:12.204
here in the Caribbean and Mexico

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:14.563
and expanding in South America,

00:01:14.563 --> 00:01:18.320
these colonial exploits
were pretty small indeed,

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.677
but I think it's important to
learn a little bit about them

00:01:21.677 --> 00:01:24.544
because they help us see the ways

00:01:24.544 --> 00:01:28.461
in which the different
goals of colonial powers

00:01:30.735 --> 00:01:34.902
led to very different types
of settlement in the New World

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:39.067
and very different relationships

00:01:39.067 --> 00:01:42.317
between Europeans and Native Americans.

00:01:47.418 --> 00:01:50.357
Now, though it's a little
bit hard to see on this map,

00:01:50.357 --> 00:01:54.524
these two colonies focused
their efforts around two rivers,

00:01:55.598 --> 00:01:57.598
the Saint Lawrence River

00:01:59.378 --> 00:02:00.876
and the Hudson River

00:02:00.876 --> 00:02:04.793
which runs along this
little orange strip here.

00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:09.298
And along these rivers,

00:02:09.298 --> 00:02:12.715
you can still see the
cities that were founded

00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:16.882
by these colonial ventures
like Quebec City up in Canada,

00:02:18.777 --> 00:02:23.622
later Montreal and down here
of course the most famous

00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:26.122
which started as New Amsterdam

00:02:26.992 --> 00:02:29.664
and later became the city of New York.

00:02:29.664 --> 00:02:33.414
Right about here is
the Island of Manhattan

00:02:33.414 --> 00:02:35.331
on which New York City,

00:02:37.082 --> 00:02:39.999
formerly New Amsterdam, is located.

00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:43.028
Now, looking at this
map, you might wonder,

00:02:43.028 --> 00:02:47.195
why was it that Spain have
these giant swabs of territory

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.191
really from coast to coast

00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:52.672
where New France and New Netherland

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:56.083
really only followed along these rivers,

00:02:56.083 --> 00:02:57.380
at least to start with?

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.854
And the answer really lies
in this idea of goals.

00:03:00.854 --> 00:03:04.348
And New France and New
Netherland sat on the rivers,

00:03:04.348 --> 00:03:07.037
rivers being the highways of the world

00:03:07.037 --> 00:03:09.289
really up until the
invention of the railroad,

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:13.661
because they were primarily
interested in trade.

00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:15.763
So let's talk a little
bit more about that.

00:03:15.763 --> 00:03:19.869
French and Dutch explorers
were particularly interested

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:24.036
in gaining valuable furs to
trade from Native Americans

00:03:24.964 --> 00:03:27.836
living in the Northern
part of North America

00:03:27.836 --> 00:03:29.591
that they could then sell in Europe.

00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:32.787
Long before European colonization began,

00:03:32.787 --> 00:03:36.280
beavers had been hunted pretty
much to extinction in Europe

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.795
while beaver pelts
themselves were usually used

00:03:39.795 --> 00:03:42.292
to create fancy hats.

00:03:42.292 --> 00:03:44.088
This is a hat from a slightly later era,

00:03:44.088 --> 00:03:45.804
but you can get the sense here

00:03:45.804 --> 00:03:49.887
that Europeans met on
something of an equal basis

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.971
with Native Americans in the
process of the fur trade,

00:03:53.971 --> 00:03:57.402
so Europeans wanted beaver pelts

00:03:57.402 --> 00:04:01.569
and also the pelts of other
animals and often fish,

00:04:03.907 --> 00:04:07.262
another thing that was in great supply

00:04:07.262 --> 00:04:10.397
in this Northern region which is today

00:04:10.397 --> 00:04:13.172
the Northeast United States and Canada.

00:04:13.172 --> 00:04:17.700
So how did this focus on
trade affect the relationships

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.876
between Europeans and Native
Americans in the area?

00:04:21.876 --> 00:04:25.486
Well, primarily they made
relationships between them

00:04:25.486 --> 00:04:28.779
considerably friendlier
and more cooperative

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:31.296
than the relationships between the Spanish

00:04:31.296 --> 00:04:33.123
and Native Americans for example.

00:04:33.123 --> 00:04:35.037
Now, Europeans quickly discovered

00:04:35.037 --> 00:04:39.686
that it made a lot more sense
to instead of sending hundreds

00:04:39.686 --> 00:04:42.763
upon hundreds of Frenchmen to Canada

00:04:42.763 --> 00:04:44.554
to hunt beavers themselves,

00:04:44.554 --> 00:04:47.107
they could instead pay Native Americans

00:04:47.107 --> 00:04:48.690
to hunt the beavers for them.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.370
And consequently, there
were considerably fewer

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.537
French and Dutch settlers in
New Netherland and New France

00:04:58.263 --> 00:05:01.414
than there were in New Spain.

00:05:01.414 --> 00:05:04.076
And because there were fewer of them,

00:05:04.076 --> 00:05:06.263
they generally ended up doing things

00:05:06.263 --> 00:05:09.346
more on the terms of Native Americans

00:05:10.731 --> 00:05:14.814
so whereas the Spanish
might have used their guns

00:05:16.821 --> 00:05:20.444
and their war dogs to
force Native Americans

00:05:20.444 --> 00:05:21.711
to labor for them,

00:05:21.711 --> 00:05:25.516
the French and the Dutch
were more likely to observe

00:05:25.516 --> 00:05:29.086
trading rituals like giving gifts

00:05:29.086 --> 00:05:32.924
and also fostering trade relationships

00:05:32.924 --> 00:05:34.423
through intermarriage.

00:05:34.423 --> 00:05:37.275
French traders learned
the Algonquian language

00:05:37.275 --> 00:05:40.496
and married native women
and had children with them

00:05:40.496 --> 00:05:43.134
so that they could be
considered part of the family.

00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:46.850
They even allied with
Native American Tribes

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.811
against their own enemies
and went to war with them

00:05:50.811 --> 00:05:53.057
as in the case in 1609

00:05:53.057 --> 00:05:55.897
when French explorer Samuel de Champlain

00:05:55.897 --> 00:06:00.266
helped Algonquians in their
war against the Iroquois.

00:06:00.266 --> 00:06:01.833
And like New France,

00:06:01.833 --> 00:06:06.000
New Netherland situated as it
was in this very good harbor,

00:06:06.905 --> 00:06:11.061
the Island of Manhattan, was
likewise very focused on trade.

00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:15.228
In fact, New Amsterdam was a
little bit of a company town

00:06:16.803 --> 00:06:20.303
controlled by the Dutch West India Company

00:06:22.694 --> 00:06:25.376
which sought to make the
most of all of the goodies

00:06:25.376 --> 00:06:27.464
that could be brought from North America

00:06:27.464 --> 00:06:29.049
and then shipped to Europe.

00:06:29.049 --> 00:06:32.907
In fact, you can get a sense
of what the major concerns

00:06:32.907 --> 00:06:36.563
of the Europeans settling in
this area were from this map.

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:40.730
You can see that they point
out where beavers, turkeys,

00:06:43.195 --> 00:06:47.362
foxes, and bears can be found
all with their valuable pelts,

00:06:48.603 --> 00:06:52.770
but you also see that
there's an extremely detailed

00:06:53.706 --> 00:06:57.834
rendering of where many
Native American Tribes lived

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:01.260
like this detailed
rendering of what I believe

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.118
is a Mahican village.

00:07:03.118 --> 00:07:06.193
The French and Dutch bothered
to learn all of these names

00:07:06.193 --> 00:07:09.485
and map all of this territory
because they cooperated

00:07:09.485 --> 00:07:12.296
with the Native Americans
to get these pelts.

00:07:12.296 --> 00:07:14.582
It's hard to imagine a Spanish map

00:07:14.582 --> 00:07:18.351
that would go into such
detail about native villages.

00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:19.787
It's important to remember

00:07:19.787 --> 00:07:22.833
that Europeans were
competing with each other

00:07:22.833 --> 00:07:24.994
for resources in the New World

00:07:24.994 --> 00:07:29.228
hoping that they could secure
the best trade deals for furs

00:07:29.228 --> 00:07:32.920
with Native Americans
and prevent other nations

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.787
from securing those furs.

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:38.579
For example, the Dutch
allied with the Iroquois

00:07:38.579 --> 00:07:41.202
in the New World as trading partners

00:07:41.202 --> 00:07:45.042
because the Iroquois were
the long-time enemies

00:07:45.042 --> 00:07:48.116
of the Algonquians who were
allied with the French.

00:07:48.116 --> 00:07:52.300
So just as the Europeans
recruited Native Americans

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.347
into their competitions to
supply Europe with furs,

00:07:56.347 --> 00:07:59.047
Native Americans recruited Europeans

00:07:59.047 --> 00:08:01.543
into their inter-tribal feuds

00:08:01.543 --> 00:08:04.537
to supply the Americas
with European goods.

00:08:04.537 --> 00:08:07.868
I wanna finish by just briefly comparing

00:08:07.868 --> 00:08:11.493
each nation's colonial
goals with their outcomes

00:08:11.493 --> 00:08:13.582
and what sorts of people settled,

00:08:13.582 --> 00:08:16.665
what the relationships were
like with Native Americans,

00:08:16.665 --> 00:08:20.298
and even how they
attempted or didn't attempt

00:08:20.298 --> 00:08:23.712
to convert Native Americans
to a form of Christianity.

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:25.669
Now, as we saw with Spain,

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:29.656
their goal was to quickly
extract natural resources

00:08:29.656 --> 00:08:32.621
from the Americas and
to set up plantations

00:08:32.621 --> 00:08:35.141
for tobacco and later sugar,

00:08:35.141 --> 00:08:39.952
plus to convert as many of the
native people to Catholicism

00:08:39.952 --> 00:08:42.647
as possible by force if necessary

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:44.789
and it was frequently necessary.

00:08:44.789 --> 00:08:48.019
Consequently, most of the Spanish settlers

00:08:48.019 --> 00:08:52.331
who came to the New World
were men and adventurers

00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:56.299
who treated native people with
violence and enslaved them

00:08:56.299 --> 00:08:57.819
in the encomienda system

00:08:57.819 --> 00:09:01.129
and in some cases had
relationships with native women

00:09:01.129 --> 00:09:05.656
and African women that resulted
in that very complex set

00:09:05.656 --> 00:09:10.485
of racial designations we
see in the caste system.

00:09:10.485 --> 00:09:14.531
But France and the Netherlands
by contrast came for trade.

00:09:14.531 --> 00:09:19.121
They wanted furs and fish
and so they were very careful

00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:21.929
to cultivate very friendly relationships

00:09:21.929 --> 00:09:25.655
with Native Americans including
by intermarrying with them

00:09:25.655 --> 00:09:27.739
in a deliberate and formal way

00:09:27.739 --> 00:09:31.078
so that they could take
advantage of having natives

00:09:31.078 --> 00:09:32.790
do the hunting for them

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:34.886
rather than having to do it themselves

00:09:34.886 --> 00:09:37.840
so that really only a few men

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.823
came to New France and New Netherland,

00:09:39.823 --> 00:09:41.948
nothing like the numbers of Spain.

00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:44.186
And unlike the Spanish,

00:09:44.186 --> 00:09:46.671
although the French did attempt

00:09:46.671 --> 00:09:49.051
to convert natives to Catholicism,

00:09:49.051 --> 00:09:51.260
they rarely did so by force.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:54.973
Now, going forward as we talk
about British colonization

00:09:54.973 --> 00:09:56.543
in the next few lessons,

00:09:56.543 --> 00:09:59.107
I want you to keep both the Spanish

00:09:59.107 --> 00:10:03.332
and the French and Dutch modes
of colonization in your mind

00:10:03.332 --> 00:10:07.151
so you can compare and
contrast English colonization

00:10:07.151 --> 00:10:08.080
with both of them.

00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:09.126
And as we'll see,

00:10:09.126 --> 00:10:11.862
the goals of the various English colonies

00:10:11.862 --> 00:10:13.803
whether it's to found plantations

00:10:13.803 --> 00:10:15.558
like in Jamestown, Virginia,

00:10:15.558 --> 00:10:18.074
or to escape religious persecution

00:10:18.074 --> 00:10:19.771
like in Massachusetts Bay,

00:10:19.771 --> 00:10:22.074
that goal will go on to influence

00:10:22.074 --> 00:10:25.431
not only who came to the
Americas from Europe,

00:10:25.431 --> 00:10:28.374
but also their relationships
with native people.
