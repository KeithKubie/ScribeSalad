MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon,
everyone.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:05.560
Thank you for making your way up
into the inner recesses of

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:06.660
the Googleplex here.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.900
We're very pleased to host a
true inventor in our midst

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.580
today for Talks at Google.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.210
We actually have Brett
Stern here.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.800
He's an industrial designer and
inventor, currently living

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.770
in Portland, Oregon.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.700
So he has the whole Portlandia
thing going on.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.860
His contributions span a
variety of industries--

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.780
anything from the textile and
pharmaceutical industries to

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:27.040
consumer packaged goods.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.560
Things like Beer Chips, which
are actually quite amazing.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.100
He speaks to us today about
his new book, which is

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.800
entitled "Inventors at Work." In
it, he profiles a series of

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.260
inventors across industries,
looks for commonalities, does

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.730
some in person and phone
interviews, and creates this

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.340
book that is now part of the "At
Work" series, continuing

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.180
the tradition of coders
at work and so forth.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.990
He describes common threads and
Eureka moments from people

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.220
like Steve Wozniak and the
inventor of the Leatherman,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.250
which are both very near and
dear to the tech work that we

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.300
do here at Google.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.565
So without further ado, please
join me in welcoming Brett to

00:01:02.565 --> 00:01:03.811
the Googleplex.

00:01:03.811 --> 00:01:07.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.610
BRETT STERN: So, I am an
industrial designer, and most

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.320
people have no idea
what that is.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.700
They go to the store, they buy
stuff, and they don't really

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.130
think what's behind it.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.660
When I try to explain what an
industrial designer is,

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.300
there's this very vague look
on people's faces.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.130
And then I say, well,
you know an iPhone

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.550
is designed so great?

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.030
And they're like, yeah,
we understand that!

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.420
And then they say, well, did
you design the iPhone?

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.810
And then I have to say no, and
they're sort of upset.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.300
And so I've learned over years
and come to accept that I tell

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.670
people now that I'm
an inventor.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.710
And everyone knows
one inventor.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.120
They sort of have these romantic
thoughts in their

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.570
head of a lone guy
in a garage--

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.870
maybe crazy, or maybe he's a
genius, they don't really

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.290
know-- but sort of working the
late night oil, and just sort

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.070
of making something new to make
the world a better place,

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.160
make our lives easier,
and so forth.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.420
So I do have that background.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.940
I am an industrial designer,
though I like to sort of step

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.080
back and work on projects before
you even know what the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.800
problem is.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.440
And that's sort of how I work
the inventor side in.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.440
So this project came along,
the "Inventors at Work,"

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.870
Apress the publisher.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.720
They've done a number of
books in this series.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.300
And so they just said, hey,
go figure the book out.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.110
Work within the format we're
doing, which is go out and

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.990
find people within that
industry, interview them,

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.780
whatever questions you want,
and then sort of edit these

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.800
conversations to do
whatever you want.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.940
I read a great deal about
inventors, about creative

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.550
people, and the process
and so forth.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.590
I feel I'm able to go from
surgical instruments to potato

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.300
chips easily, because I
understand the process of what

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.630
it is to be a creative person
and how to think

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.060
broadly over that.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.250
And so my goal of this project
was not to talk to these

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.260
inventors about their products,
which generally most

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.350
stories talk about, but
rather the process.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.430
So it wasn't about the product
they were doing, but about the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.520
process that they go
through every day.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.370
And the goal was, what I was
trying to learn and what I'm

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.900
trying to convey to the reader,
is what are those--

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.140
are there commonalities?

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.590
Are there certain traits that
we inventive people, we

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.170
creative people have inside of
us that somehow makes us

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.500
different from all the other
kids on the block?

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.330
And so, going into it, I would
sort of start this generic

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.190
question, and try to dial down
and try to seek what they were

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.020
really thinking,
how they think.

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.660
And it's not so much thinking
when they're behind their

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.410
keyboard or their desk or their
drawing board, but how

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.160
they're thinking during the day,
at night, when they're

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.920
sleeping, when they're
on top of a mountain.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.730
Just how they think, and what
their process is to go from

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.290
point A to point B. And so my
presentation is going to be

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.890
what I learned from doing this
book, and what these

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.130
commonalities are,
and so forth.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.290
Now, when I started the book,
I had carte blanche to just

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.600
find any inventor that I wanted,
and that's sort of

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.060
like the dream list.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.630
And the reality is, when you say
inventors, you know their

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.510
inventions, but you
don't really know

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.605
the person, the inventor.

00:04:08.605 --> 00:04:10.700
I mean, we know Thomas Edison.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.980
We may know Steve Wozniak and a
few other technical people.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.480
But we really don't know
the person behind it.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:22.160
So my process was to just start
with this empty slate,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.020
and put down industries or
technologies or products that

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.070
I wanted to know.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.120
Obvious electronics--

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.480
computers and things
like that.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:36.420
Transportation, medical,
communication, fun, sports,

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.250
materials, whatever it was.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.710
And then my process was to go
out there and find these

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.980
people and do the process.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.430
And the process was just sort
of going online and frankly,

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:52.300
Googling the companies or the
people that I wanted to do,

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.710
and then just continuously
research who these people

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.170
were, finding everything out
there was about them.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.180
And then I would be interviewing
them, mostly on

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.070
the phone, through Skype,
through videoconferencing,

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.270
putting all these conversations
into

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.870
conversations, having them
transcribed, then editing them

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.620
out, creating Word documents,
sitting in an Ergon chair with

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:19.930
my noise cancelling
headsets on.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.170
And while I was doing this,
I just realized all the

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:25.520
technology and all the
inventions that allowed me to

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.960
sit in a chair in my room all
by myself to sort of find

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.300
these people out there
was just amazing.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.680
So the presentation will talk
about these commonalities.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.630
So dreaming.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.640
"When I was young, I would go
to sleep thinking about

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.820
computer programs or computer
hardware problems or math

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.600
problems in school.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.480
Sleep and think, and think as
I fell asleep, working the

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.970
variables in my head, seeing
the lines of code.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.540
And then I would wake up in
the middle of the night

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.170
sometimes and have a solution
that would save one line of

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.030
code in a program.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.190
So I believe very much that
your mind is working while

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.070
you're dreaming."
Steve Wozniak.

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.560
I mean, we all know
who this guy was.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.820
And of all these common traits,
I think the biggest

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:08.110
one that makes us unique
as creative

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.750
people is this dreaming.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.210
And somehow, dreaming has a
negative connotation in

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.070
today's society--

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.670
like, you're daydreaming, you're
wandering off, you're

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.520
not focused, just pay
attention here.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.910
That you can't pay attention.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.900
But dreaming is just
sort of essential.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.530
I mean, it's somewhat of a
childlike thing, because we do

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:27.640
it all as a child.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.330
And hopefully as an
adult, we can

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:30.710
continue that in the process.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.340
So this daydreaming, or this
dreaming, is really a very

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.200
important quality.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.410
And this is, I think, out of
all these traits is the one

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:43.270
thing that you cannot be taught
or educated or advance.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.160
It's either in you and
you allow it to

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.950
happen or you don't.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.530
And I think that's what makes us
as creative inventive types

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.430
different from the rest of
the people out there.

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.350
So pondering.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.480
"I know that if I go to a
seminar or a conference to

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.290
hear someone talk, I'll drift
off, because the mechanism, or

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.300
the chemistry, or the approach
that they're talking about

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.830
spurs an idea that might
be useful in solving or

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.800
addressing some of the
problems I have.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.130
Even when it's not really what
the guy or lady is talking

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.390
about specifically, but
something analogous to that."

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:13.610
So the pondering.

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.600
This is Al Maurice.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.410
He's a polymer chemist at Dow
Chemical, and what he

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:22.450
developed was the polymers to
go from oil based paints to

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:23.910
acrylic based paints.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:28.340
Now, if you're at a certain
age, there was always oil

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:28.980
based paints.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.890
And if you went down to the
garage, there was a coffee can

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.840
with a stiff brush in there all
sort of stuck together.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.070
And if you walked into a room
that was just painted with oil

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.670
based paints, you would smell
the fumes, and you'd get a

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.540
headache or you'd drift
off or something.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:45.950
Well, this guy figured out all
the polymer chemistry.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:48.860
So he wasn't developing paint,
but it was the thing to go

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:50.480
into the thing to the thing.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.090
And so it was just so far
removed, but his days were

00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:57.110
just mixing chemicals together
to get to this final point.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.460
And so he'd been working,
literally, on the same problem

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:03.100
for the last 30 years to make
water-based paints.

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:06.550
And the fun part of asking
these people just general

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.620
questions is I actually got
to ask him the process.

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:13.050
And he'd go, well, we mix all
these things together, and we

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.250
basically put the paint
out there, and then

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.220
we'd watch it dry.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.750
And I was like, you actually got
paid to watch paint dry.

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.890
And so he really did get paid
to watch paint dry.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.100
Just fascinating.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:28.730
It just really used the process
of creativity to

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.039
develop all these things.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.465
Also, some of these people were
corporate people, some

00:08:34.465 --> 00:08:36.549
were academia, some
governmental,

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:38.700
some guys in a garage.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.440
Al works at Dow Chemical,
certainly a well known company

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.110
that promotes technology and
promotes innovation.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:48.790
What was interesting, that there
are companies out there,

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.290
and I'm sure Google is very
similar, that once you become

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.680
successful in what you're
doing, you go up

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.000
the corporate ladder.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.020
But companies like Dow,
companies like Corning,

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.210
companies like IBM and GE, they
allow their technical

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:04.700
people to advance and go up
the corporate ladder, but

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.110
still stay, in a sense, in the
lab doing their research.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:09.650
So they didn't have to
become a manager.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:11.070
If they wanted to,
they could do it.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.190
And I think Al, at some point,
had become a manager.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.780
But really, he was managing
the innovation, the

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:17.600
creativity.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.830
But he is still in
the lab every day

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:23.060
mixing things together.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:26.070
"To prospective inventors, I say
rule one is perseverance.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:27.930
If you're working on an
invention, at some point,

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:30.540
you're probably going to think
about giving up and going on

00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.690
to something else.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:34.310
I realize there's a fine line
between perseverance and

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.960
failure to accept reality.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.260
But I recommend that you lean
toward staying with it too

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.130
long rather than giving up too
soon." That's Tim Leatherman,

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.000
who happens to be in Portland,
Oregon, who I

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.680
interviewed in person.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.450
And so I'm sure everyone knows
the Leatherman tool.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.760
There actually is a guy named
Tim Leatherman behind

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.130
Leatherman Tools.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.370
And they actually have developed
leather working

00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:55.180
tools, but no one
ever buys them.

00:09:55.180 --> 00:09:58.660
So he was trained as a
mechanical engineer, travelled

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:02.480
around in the early '70s in
Europe with his soon to be

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.050
wife, bought a car, stayed
in cheap hotels.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.530
And he was always fixing this
car or fixing the plumbing in

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:11.000
these cheap hotels traveling
around Europe.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.750
And so he was always looking for
pliers or screwdrivers or

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.740
tools to sort of fix
his daily routine.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:19.090
And so when he came back, even
though he was trained as an

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.330
engineer and actually worked
when he got out of school in

00:10:22.330 --> 00:10:25.480
engineering, he decided he
wanted to develop this

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.490
multi-purpose tool that has
now become part of the

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.570
vernacular, and actually spent
seven years in his garage,

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:34.550
from the time of making his
first prototype to then

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.210
actually commercialization.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.400
So here's a man, for seven
years, just living--

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.640
he was not working, just going
broke trying to develop the

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:44.060
Leatherman tool.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.230
And now his proudest achievement
is actually not

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.950
the tool, but they do all their

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:49.290
manufacturing in Portland.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.980
So he has 300 people there in
Portland and making the thing.

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:54.950
And so he feels the greatest
thing that he's done is

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:58.280
actually employing 300 people
to produce his product.

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.930
"Failure is a way of learning.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.050
What may be considered failures
are actually other

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:06.140
great ideas." Anybody
know Robert Denard?

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:07.670
He invented RAM memory.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.050
I mean, memory.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.840
It's what we all live
on right now.

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.990
He's 84-years-old.

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.340
He's a senior fellow
at IBM, still in

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.000
there every day working.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.750
Pretty amazing.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:21.160
Now, when you invent something,
there's always this

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.200
prior art--

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.770
what someone did beforehand.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:27.410
And what was fascinating talking
to Bob was what he

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.480
did, there really was nothing
before there.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.260
Everything was a bunch
of tubes and

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.820
vacuums and so forth.

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:36.180
So he really is the first one
who created something new,

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.860
which is just such a
rarity these days.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:43.380
And I think one of things we
get hung up as people, as a

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:46.040
society, is failure
is a bad thing.

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.530
But failure is such
a great thing.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:50.610
You learn what's not working for
that particular problem,

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:53.710
but you have that experience,
and you go on and apply that

00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:56.910
knowledge to something else
at a future point.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:58.170
Self motivation.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.560
"You know, when there's a
certain joy to what you do,

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.190
and when you have this certain
energy, that's

00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.660
what makes me happy.

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.010
Doing these things
made me happy.

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:07.180
That was the real motivation.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:11.380
It made me happy." So Gary
Mickelson is a spinal surgeon.

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.900
And just to give you an idea how
successful he was, he sold

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:16.870
all his patents-- about 250--

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.530
in 2005 for $1.4 billion.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:23.670
Totally changed the way
everything did.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:27.450
What was interesting, here
is a man who is totally

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:31.630
successful in what he's doing,
but totally insecure about was

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:33.830
he ever really successful
in doing this?

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.830
And he said, every time he would
create something, and

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.400
when he was a resident, all the
doctors would say, don't

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.140
do that, you're wrong,
you're stupid.

00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:43.340
Do it my way that I've always
done it before.

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.380
And the biggest thing he said
that the doctors told him, the

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:49.580
biggest reservation they had is,
like, don't kill anybody.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:52.820
And so when we invent something,
we think, oh, well,

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:55.910
that program won't work, or that
toy won't work, whatever.

00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:59.610
Well, he could paralyze
people or kill people.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:02.260
So it's just fascinating that
he really changed the whole

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:06.510
subject matter and the whole
range of medical procedures.

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:11.760
Seek inspiration outside your
field. "Solutions kind of

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.590
flash into your brain
at some point.

00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.250
I can't really explain what my
subconscious activity is,

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.010
especially these days.

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.910
I like to spend a lot of my time
on my farm pushing rocks

00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:22.170
around with my tractor.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:25.830
It's a background process or
subconscious process I really

00:13:25.830 --> 00:13:26.640
cannot explain.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.270
Usually it's related to having
a problem I want to solve.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.760
I don't sit back and dream up
solutions to things that don't

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:34.150
have a problem yet, but when
faced with a problem, usually

00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:37.190
the solutions, in my field, at
least, come pretty quickly.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:39.030
I can't give you a recipe
for invention.

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:40.220
That's impossible."

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.490
So Eric was a physicist.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:44.480
He was a professor at Columbia
doing research.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:47.360
And then in the early '80s,
got brought out to Jet

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.820
Propulsion Labs to work on
satellite camera systems.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.720
At the time, they were
all film based, and

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.010
used big heavy batteries.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.130
And they were shooting two,
three satellites up, and they

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:57.580
needed to record everything.

00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.805
What he developed was
a digital camera.

00:14:00.805 --> 00:14:02.760
Every digital camera on
your phone now is

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.970
stuff that he developed.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:06.240
So he did this back
in the '80s.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.410
When we talk to him in this day
and age, I said, did you

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:16.760
ever think 30 years later, 20
years later, that every phone

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.480
would have a camera?

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:22.820
And he's still redeveloping this
technology today, and now

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:23.570
they're on cameras.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.890
But he's saying, eventually,
you're going to be swallowing

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.280
these cameras and looking
inside of you and taking

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.680
pictures, which their
researchers are doing already.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.008
So it's just fascinating.

00:14:33.008 --> 00:14:36.350
AUDIENCE: I was just curious,
was the camera-- did it come

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:40.940
from an inspiration outside
of what he was working on?

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.180
BRETT STERN: You know, I don't
really know where he found

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.230
that inspiration from.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.020
It's a good question.

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:49.400
But I think what he was sort of
saying there-- that because

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.100
he was a physicist, he didn't
approach this as a camera

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.330
solution or as a
film solution.

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:59.970
He was just looking outside
of the typical field.

00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:03.700
And I think a lot of the people
that I interviewed

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.630
found solutions in
other venues.

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.460
Sharing ideas with others.

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.790
"Motivating a group to be
creative is not difficult.

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:13.320
I believe that sharing ideas
is the secret to developing

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.390
new concepts.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.740
If you can create an atmosphere
of honestly sharing

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:19.520
whatever comes to your mind, I
don't care how brilliant you

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.230
are, or how slow thinking
anybody is.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.080
If they're willing to open up
and let whatever they say or

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.050
think come to the floor and
share with everyone else, even

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.010
if it's the stupidest idea,
and they know it's stupid,

00:15:29.010 --> 00:15:31.850
when they say it, it often
leads to something.

00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:33.670
When you get two, three, or
four people together in a

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:36.560
room, and you just open up and
say whatever you're thinking,

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.050
good things will happen."

00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:42.260
So Reyn Guyer, the Nerf ball.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:44.140
I mean, it's the Nerf ball.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.850
I mean, this is the other
extreme of what

00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:48.160
invention is all about.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.840
And what the guy invented before
the Nerf ball, because

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.750
it was all about playing?

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.860
He invented the Twister game.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.670
And I think that's actually
even a more

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:56.810
amazing thing, because--

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:59.450
and this is pretty dated, but
back in the mid '60s when he

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:03.040
developed this, society was
much more restrained and

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:03.750
conservative.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:06.530
But basically, Twister opened up
where people could actually

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:09.120
touch each other and physically
interact with each

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.980
other, really changing the
social dynamics of society in

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:13.790
something what he was doing.

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.700
So able to visualize ideas in
their heads. "I visualize in

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.010
three dimensions what the
products look like, and being

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:21.120
such a hands-on builder of
products, I like to very

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.570
quickly get into the three
dimensional form.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.820
I spend half an hour on a simple
sketch, then get right

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.580
into trying to build something,
either carving out

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.660
of foam with a rasp, or building
Bondo onto a last

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:32.380
shape."

00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.000
Martin Keen with
Keen Footwear.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.400
Anybody know Keen Footwear?

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.560
So, totally changed how shoes
look, but really changed how

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.540
shoes feel.

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:44.390
So he's an industrial
designer also.

00:16:44.390 --> 00:16:46.880
So very hands-on type
of guy, as I am.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:51.560
So before, the way shoes were
designed where the factory

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.450
would have the last, which
is the shoe shape.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.840
They would give it to the
designer, this generic shape

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:57.820
of all different sizes.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.360
And they would just sort of
design around the shoe last.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.660
What he did, he actually went
out and cast people's feet.

00:17:03.660 --> 00:17:06.520
Now, it sounds so obvious to
do something like that, but

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.380
the designers never really
had that option

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.960
before, to be that hands-on.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.490
And because of that, if you've
ever worn Keen Footwear, they

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:14.930
really fit a lot better.

00:17:14.930 --> 00:17:16.200
And they're really
comfortable.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.210
And now, if you look at the way
shoes are, certainly the

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:21.250
toe shape, they really have
changed because of what he's

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.599
put in there.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:23.750
A touch of obsession.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.300
"I saw 'Star Wars' on the big
screen when I was 11.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.780
It was 1977, and I fell
in love with R2-D2.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.050
If you've seen 'Star Wars,'
you'll know that R2-D2 is more

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:33.040
than a machine.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.570
He has a personality, he has
an agenda, and he is one of

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:36.180
the main characters.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.090
It was the first time I
saw potentially what a

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:39.300
machine could be.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.340
Now, we're not there yet, but
my motivation is R2-D2."

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:43.710
This is Helen Greiner.

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.350
The company she had at
the time was iRobot.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:49.550
And consumer-wise, you may know
of the Roomba robot that

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:51.690
sort of goes around your
apartment to clean it up.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:53.760
But really, what they've made
their money for, and really

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.710
the technology developed are
all the robots that are in

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:59.820
Iran and Iraq to disassemble
bombs out there.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.250
Just an amazing thing
what they're doing.

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:06.210
And just a brilliant woman
from MIT, and just really

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:09.170
changed the way what machines
could think and how they could

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:10.850
see and they can move.

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:14.330
And this is just all what she's
thinking about all day.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.840
"So the neat thing about 3M is
that we have experts in just

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.990
about every field that you
can possibly imagine.

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:20.840
We've all got these people
who are willing to help.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.180
But you need to take
advantage. of

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.760
it." Matthew Scholz.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.560
So he's a researcher at 3M.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:28.510
Has anybody ever broken their
arm and had a cast?

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:31.590
All right, all those casts,
that's this guy.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:34.150
If anybody has ever had an
operation, and they put this

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:36.880
film on your body for
anti-microbal, where it sort

00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:39.450
of separates, that's this
guy over there.

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:40.680
Completely different things.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.770
But what's important to him is
that he didn't necessarily

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:46.810
know all the ideas and all the
solutions, but he was able to

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:50.110
go out into his surrounding
force and ask a lot of

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.750
questions, the [INAUDIBLE]
experts.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:54.380
And I'm sure each one of you
are experts with your own

00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:56.490
thing, but sometimes you
don't really know.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.420
And so the commonality here
was just continuously ask

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.070
questions to people.

00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:03.680
Work in multidisciplinary teams.
"I only work with teams

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.870
of people with a variety of
different backgrounds--

00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:08.050
engineers, scientists,
biologists, nutritional

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:09.110
scientists.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:11.460
In order for an initiative to
be successfully impactful,

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:14.500
each person of a teams is
critical, and the one person

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:15.670
alone won't be able to do it.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:18.340
The initial technical area or
original concept might be one

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.450
person's contribution, but it'll
need to be reduced to

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:24.330
practice in the lab, scaled
up, utility-tested and

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.070
vetted."

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.510
Bernard works right now
at General Mills.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.560
I assume you all eat dried
cereal in the morning.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.820
Well, all those little
marshmallow shapes, or all

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:36.500
those little round donuts and
everything, this is what this

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.490
guy developed.

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.670
So he was trained as a food
scientist, but when he got out

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:43.410
of school back in the late '60s,
there were all these new

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:45.500
extrusion machines that
were coming about.

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:49.610
And he actually got a job
working for this company to

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:52.020
promote this machine, in a
sense, sell the machine with

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:53.180
this food background.

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.180
So he went into the marketplace
and trained all

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:58.660
these people how to use this
extrusion machine.

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:02.050
So now all the dried cereals
and crackers and flatbreads

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.460
that you eat are because
of this guy over here.

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:08.050
Continuous learning. "I think
you try to look for colleagues

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:10.280
who you can learn stuff from,
and you always have to be

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.740
learning stuff from different
people." So Karen is a

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:14.950
scientist at the Naval
Research Labs.

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:17.030
I'm assuming you do people
know of DARPA?

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:19.040
Well, the Naval Research
Labs are similar that

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.820
they're doing work.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.660
Her current project is she's
developed this fuel cell that

00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:27.890
can have a drone fly for 24
hours just on hydrogen.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.520
So you can imagine
the implications.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:32.310
And it's not a big plane, but
it's still something that is

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.770
elevated for 24 hours.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:39.710
The concept is that aircraft and
boats and eventually cars

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.370
could run on these fuel
cells out there.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:44.750
Now, she is a chemist and a
brilliant woman, but she is

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.580
working with all these just PhD
people out there that she

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.890
can go and put these teams
together and continuously find

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:54.210
new solutions to problems.

00:20:54.210 --> 00:20:56.610
Work on multiple projects. "Our
teams are working on many

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:58.530
separate projects
simultaneously.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.240
It does create a din of
discussions that's sometimes

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.410
hard to separate.

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:03.830
But I do find that
working on them

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:06.200
simultaneously forces synergies.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.840
Inventors and innovators usually
have very busy minds,

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.100
so to try to keep ourselves
focused on one

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.710
thing becomes a challenge.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:15.090
We try to make sure we have
outlets for multiple tracks of

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:16.990
thought, whether they're
personal projects that we are

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:19.800
doing outside of work or
multiple internal projects

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:20.600
that we're working on.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.410
This multitask approach keeps
the ideas flowing."

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.900
So these three gentlemen are
also industrial designers.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.400
They're at Motorola Solutions.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.300
And they're working on police
communications.

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:32.780
You know, where the police all
have their radios on their

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:36.350
side, or the FedEx guy,
the UPS guys?

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:39.430
And they were just fascinated,
because they really get out

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:41.290
there into the marketplace
and really see how

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:42.690
people think and work.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:45.100
And their goal is really to
come up with solutions--

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.410
not their solutions, but
really going into the

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.510
marketplace and asking
the marketplace what

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.280
the solutions are.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.540
Well, what was fascinating is
that these guys are working,

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:56.236
and a lot of these people I
talked to were working on 5,

00:21:56.236 --> 00:21:58.250
10, 15 projects at a time.

00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:59.420
And I think that's important.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:02.120
I know personally it's because
you start a project and you're

00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.510
all excited, and you have all
this energy, and you ramp up

00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:06.950
these thoughts.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:08.200
And then there's time lags.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.390
You sort of have to put
projects on hold.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:12.790
And I think the idea of working
on multiple projects

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.800
gives you that opportunity to
sort of go up and down in your

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.300
cycle in working on
these things.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.630
Ask lots of questions. "To a
large degree, we want to have

00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:23.940
a good understanding of what
the problem is that we're

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.200
trying to solve, because
scientists have great ideas,

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.860
and there's never a
shortage of that.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:30.090
I think the key way that we
approach research, certainly

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:32.970
on our more applied programs, is
that we want to get aligned

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:35.140
with the right problem, So I
think it's fair to say that a

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:39.030
lot of the biggest challenges
in doing innovation is

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.700
tackling or asking the right
question, identifying the

00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:43.540
right problem."

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.090
So Glen is at General
Electric.

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.020
They're developing these
hybrid batteries for

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.990
locomotives to eventually
run on batteries,

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:54.030
not diesel fuel anymore.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.400
What was interesting about
Glenn is that he works at

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.130
General Electric.

00:22:57.130 --> 00:22:59.410
And if you look at the inventing
process, and if you

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:02.260
look at the king of inventor,
that's Thomas Edison.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:04.510
Just one thing he said to me,
when they walk into their

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:07.500
door, Thomas Edison's
desk is right there.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:10.600
And just that heritage just
drove these people for

00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:14.390
perfection, and just keep
pushing themselves, and to

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:16.190
really say what's out there.

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:17.990
Also, General Electric
was really probably

00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:19.290
the first R&amp;D lab.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:22.320
So it went from being the lone
crazy guy in the garage to

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.900
setting up in a corporate
atmosphere--

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.830
in a sense, where
you are today.

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.490
Prototype quickly. "Yes, I'm
going to stick my finger into

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.230
a moving table saw blade.

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.170
Your whole life, you have been
told not to do that.

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:35.210
Your body is telling you,
no, don't do this.

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:36.400
This is stupid."

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:39.830
So I don't know if anybody's
heard of a saw stop table saw,

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:42.690
or ever seen a demonstration,
or has anybody done

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:44.220
woodworking before?

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.840
And so you know that blade is
spinning really fast, and your

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.150
fingers are getting
really close.

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:52.280
So he's developed a saw that,
when it comes into contact

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.050
with any part of the body, will
stop in 1/10,000 of a

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:56.690
second, and will not cut
your finger off.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:24:00.570
What was interesting is that the
industry has, for years,

00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:03.110
sort of acknowledging the
problem, but sort of putting a

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:05.150
guard on that they know everyone
will take off,

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.630
because it just gets
in the way.

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:08.580
But since no one had
solved the problem,

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.850
that was the solution.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.340
Everyone said, just be careful,

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:12.960
wear your safety goggles.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:16.200
His background was he actually
has a PhD in physics, but

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.385
didn't want to teach, so went
back to school to become a

00:24:18.385 --> 00:24:19.970
patent attorney.

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.910
And then was doing woodworking
on the side, and then

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:25.530
realized, here's
a problem here.

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:29.810
And when he was explaining the
process to me, he didn't look

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:32.310
at this from a mechanical
standpoint at all.

00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:33.140
He just looked at it.

00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:37.975
He's a physicist, and he just
had these facts in his head

00:24:37.975 --> 00:24:40.720
that because I'm a physicist,
I know this, this, and this,

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.240
and of course it should work.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.745
And so we had this whole
discussion, and literally, in

00:24:44.745 --> 00:24:46.820
a half hour, he said he
prototyped this thing.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.840
And then I said, well, how did
you decide to test this?

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.040
And he goes, well, the first
one is we used a

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.100
hot dog, and it worked.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.620
But then I'm obligated to stick
my finger into this

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.220
thing, which I can't really
imagine that, because I do

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:01.580
woodworking too.

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:03.620
The conversation sort
of branched out.

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.450
Like, I wasn't asking questions,
I just wanted to

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:08.750
know, like, which finger did
you use to stick in it?

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:10.463
And so we talked about it.

00:25:10.463 --> 00:25:12.020
And he goes, well, I'm right
handed, so it's going

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:12.900
to be my left hand.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.610
He says, I need my thumb and
my pinky, because you don't

00:25:15.610 --> 00:25:17.070
want to keep hitting those.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:20.910
And you need your pointer
finger to do stuff with.

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:23.630
And then I said, well you need
this finger, because it's the

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:24.780
most important thing.

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:25.760
And he goes yeah.

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.620
So he actually chose
his ring finger.

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.830
And as a pure engineer, it's
like, he didn't really need

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:30.900
his wedding band.

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:32.830
Even though he was married, it
didn't really matter if he cut

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:33.720
that finger off.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:38.000
So he actually did stick his
ring finger into the table

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:38.800
saw, and it did work,.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.460
And now they control
80% of the market.

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.690
And turned down by the whole
industry, but really

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.910
controlling it now.

00:25:46.910 --> 00:25:48.420
Physical exercise.

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:50.170
"Research proves the
role of exercise in

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:51.270
keeping your brain vital.

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.310
I do all sorts of
cardio exercise.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:56.140
I have advanced arthritis in one
hip, but I just went out

00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.150
and ran four miles.

00:25:57.150 --> 00:26:00.420
Obsessive personalities such
as mine help in maintaining

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:01.040
these pursuits.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.760
I like to think that my
obsessions are synergistic.

00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.080
When I go and run like crazy,
I come back and feel my body

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.700
and brain are all oxygenated
and ready to work."

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.270
So Bob works at Xerox.

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.260
I assume you've all used
a Xerox machine.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:17.790
His optical printing is what
runs all these machines, and

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:18.560
it's just fascinating.

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.980
And I think all you people look
in pretty good shape.

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:23.790
You're riding bikes,
you're running,

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:25.110
you're hiking mountains.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:27.680
And we all know we sort of get
that endorphin rush when we're

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.000
out there doing something.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.250
And I know, personally, because
I do a lot of cycling,

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:33.720
that when I'm on my bike, I do
some of my best thinking,

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.380
which is somewhat
contradictory.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.440
I should be doing my best
thinking when I'm sitting down

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:38.920
in front of a piece of paper.

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:42.170
But somehow, when your body
has had this relaxation

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.020
process, you get
into this zone.

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:48.690
And so these guys feel that
physical exercise is good.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:52.680
"Never retire from inventing."
So Kevin thinks maybe when

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.400
he's dead, he's going
to retire.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.560
So he's a research mechanical
engineer at Monsanto.

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.930
And whatever you want to think
about Monsanto, that's a whole

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:01.310
other discussion.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:04.360
So what he's figured out is a
machine to actually read the

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.430
DNA a of a seed before
it's planted.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:09.150
So it's taking a tiny little
scraping off of the seed, and

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:11.480
then will figure out how to
read it in a very quick

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.880
automated process.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.690
And so I asked him, well,
how do you think?

00:27:15.690 --> 00:27:16.960
How did you come up
with this idea?

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:19.540
He goes, well, my office
is in Saint Louis.

00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:20.700
The fields are in Iowa.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.370
It's a five or six hour drive.

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.790
I have to go out there once a
month, and I'm driving five or

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:25.930
six hours by myself.

00:27:25.930 --> 00:27:29.210
And I said, I picture
myself as the seed.

00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:32.820
I'm in the ground, and the
dirt's above me, and the sun's

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.880
above me, and the rain's
coming down.

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.370
And I say to myself, if
I was a seed, what I

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:38.260
would want to be.

00:27:38.260 --> 00:27:40.230
And just the focus and
the concentration

00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:41.730
was just really good.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:44.170
And I think sometimes you have
to see the big picture.

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:48.050
But here he is just getting
really small, and really

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:49.160
looking what he was doing.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.800
And he said to me, he's
like, I get paid.

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:54.120
I don't even know
what I get paid.

00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.290
My check gets deposited, but
I have enough money.

00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:59.450
And I just want to keep
doing this forever.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:00.880
It was also interesting.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.170
This guy, originally
he was in the army.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:04.250
He went back to school after.

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:07.560
He went to community college,
took some engineering classes,

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.740
and then eventually went
back to school again.

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:13.440
And so some of these people just
were self trained people.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.890
Some community college, people,
some are MIT trained,

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:17.920
some have advanced degrees.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.900
So it's all facets.

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:20.930
Making money.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:23.300
"If you make no money with your
invention, basically you

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.360
really failed in the
real world."

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.260
And this was Ron Popeil.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:30.990
I'm sure you guys have seen Ron
Popeil on TV selling his

00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:33.560
Chopomatic or his Pocket
Fisherman.

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.970
So he's still alive there, and
actually has been retired.

00:28:36.970 --> 00:28:39.110
He sold his company a number
of years ago,.

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:43.390
And he has a new kitchen turkey
fryer that the whole

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:45.510
time while I'm interviewing,
he's trying to sell me his

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:51.340
turkey fryer, which was
really interesting.

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.740
And he cooks everything, so
he was just making it.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.320
It sounded so good.

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.880
He goes to the other extreme.

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:00.530
So his whole validation
is on money.

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:02.370
And I thought that was really
interesting, because all these

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:05.370
other people, their validation
was on the success of their

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:08.220
project, the invention
and it helps society.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:11.090
And he looked at as like, well,
if everyone's giving me

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:13.620
money, they're all using my
product, and they're getting

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.130
the advantage of that.

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:17.090
Though he never really looked at
the quality of what he was

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:19.290
doing, he just looked at the
quantity of what he was doing.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:22.020
But I think it was just
fascinating listening to the

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.360
other extreme of what's
out there.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.100
And so patents.

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:29.220
So I interviewed 23 people--

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:30.920
23 chapters, I should say.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.080
Some were multiple people.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:35.250
22 of them were inventors, and
the last two, Elizabeth and

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:36.980
John, were assistant
commissioners

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.570
at the patent office.

00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:41.220
And I wanted to know,
really, about so the

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:42.210
question about patents.

00:29:42.210 --> 00:29:45.410
Because IP is really important
to all of us, whether it's

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:47.170
hardware or software.

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.640
And these two people are now
working with individual

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.600
inventors and small
businesses.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.660
"Throughout our history, people
have come to America

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.420
looking for their freedom and
opportunity to be independent,

00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.850
create something on their
own, and claim a

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:00.300
piece of the universe.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.750
This quest has driven our
success as a nation.

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:04.990
Our office aims to make
inventors realize that there

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:07.820
is assistance here for them as
they begin their innovative

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:08.240
journey."

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.930
I mean, what's great about this
country, and what has

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:12.690
made this country is
innovation, that

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.030
we have this freedom.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:16.420
And the biggest freedom, I
think, is that you could fail.

00:30:16.420 --> 00:30:18.910
You can make a zillion mistakes,
but yet, if you

00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:21.960
achieve, you could be rewarded
for those things.

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:23.440
And you have that
ability there.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:24.810
And so the patent office--

00:30:24.810 --> 00:30:27.820
and everyone has a different
opinion on that, the good and

00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.060
bad of patents, and I know
everyone is fighting in the

00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:31.350
courts right now.

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:35.310
But patents, these guys are at
least there to help protect

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:36.070
the small business.

00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:38.330
So if you guys do have
ideas, you don't

00:30:38.330 --> 00:30:40.310
have to hire attorneys.

00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:41.300
You could do it pro se.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.600
They're having new programs that
they're establishing all

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:46.280
over the country at local
community colleges to help

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:49.640
people submit a patent pro se,
which just meaning submitting

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:50.660
to yourself.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.750
So some of the things that I've
learned just in my career

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:54.770
as an inventor--

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:57.280
we're fascinated, we have
to do something new.

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.590
And personally, that's a lot
of pressure to put on

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:00.980
yourself, doing that.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:03.750
So I think the way I've come to
terms with that-- the only

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:07.390
thing that was ever new was the
wheel, the hammer, and the

00:31:07.390 --> 00:31:08.950
process of making fire.

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:11.040
And if you have those three
variables, heat,

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.250
pressure, and time--

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:14.470
and from those heat, pressure,
and time, you could create

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:15.710
anything after that.

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:18.890
So I never really looked that
I'm doing something new.

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:22.180
What I think I'm doing is trying
to modify stuff, and

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:24.330
try to sort of see what
was done before, and

00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:25.410
what is the next step?

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:27.775
Because after I'm long and
gone, there's going to be

00:31:27.775 --> 00:31:30.540
someone after me who's going to
look at what I did and do

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.650
the next generation of stuff.

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:34.570
And I also think it's
a challenge.

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:37.020
When you think something
is new, people

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:37.800
really won't get it.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:40.460
I mean, there's always the first
adopters, but that's a

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:41.530
very small percentage.

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:45.400
So I think it's important to
understand and pay homage to

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:47.560
what someone did before, and
go to the next step.

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.900
But never think that it's going
to be so different that

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:51.740
it's never been done
before, because

00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:53.470
everything has been done.

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:55.370
And so what does it mean
to be creative?

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:58.620
And to me, I think society says
that you can draw pretty

00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:01.060
pictures, you can play an
instrument, or you can act or

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:02.000
whatever it may be.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.870
But to me, creativity is all
about problem solving.

00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:05.680
It's that simple.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.375
That's the definition.

00:32:06.375 --> 00:32:08.090
It's just problem solving.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:11.570
And it's important, I think, as
Glen from General Electric

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:14.200
said, it's important to really
define what the problem is

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:16.910
that you're going to solve, and
then go back and make sure

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:18.310
there's an equal sign.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:19.480
So innovation.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:25.250
Big buzzword right now, as
compared to what is invention

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:26.120
or innovation?

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:28.050
So to me, innovation is the

00:32:28.050 --> 00:32:30.350
commercialization of that idea.

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:34.610
It's not the idea, it's just how
you get it out there into

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:37.920
the marketplace, and the
marketing of it.

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.810
And the invention side is the
understanding and the

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:44.430
reinterpretation of scientific
or technical data.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:47.180
And so, if you're inventing
something, you really have to

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:49.360
understand how it works,
how it's made, the

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.310
materials, and so forth.

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:54.650
This is just sort of
a personal thing.

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:57.515
To be an innovative person, to
be an inventive person, to be

00:32:57.515 --> 00:33:00.940
a creative person, you need to
be flexible, whether that's

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:04.200
intellectually, emotionally,
physically.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:06.470
You just need to be adaptable
all the time.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:09.080
You may have sort of a solution,
and you go down that

00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:11.910
road, and it may not work, but
you need to be able to adapt

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:14.470
continuously to say,
oh, I could change.

00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:16.800
And I think that's just, as
you get older, it becomes

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.100
harder to change.

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:20.900
And so you have to sort
of resist all that and

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.150
continuously be flexible.

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.410
There are adrenaline junkies.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:28.100
I'm an experience junkie.

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.190
And so I've jumped out of
a plane, so I don't

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:31.680
need to do it again.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.660
But I just love having different
experiences.

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.695
And sometimes it's just eating
a meal or eating a food that

00:33:36.695 --> 00:33:37.920
I've never had before.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.360
But it's just all these
experiences add up to

00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:44.460
opportunities and situations
that you could reference from.

00:33:44.460 --> 00:33:49.480
And this is time I've come to
know that it doesn't matter

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.400
how smart you are or how much
money you have, this is the

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.130
only thing in the world that
is limited and you cannot

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:56.270
create more of.

00:33:56.270 --> 00:33:59.160
No one will ever create more
time, so use it wisely.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:02.290
I mean, it's important to look
long term down the road.

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:04.740
But as John Maynard Keynes
said, in the long

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:05.870
term, you're dead.

00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:07.820
And that will happen
eventually.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:11.080
And so use your time wisely
and really focus on what

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.130
you're doing at the moment.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:15.480
If you're putting stuff out
there, I'm sure you guys think

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.650
about this all the time--
telling a good story.

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:20.590
You want people to buy into
what you're doing.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:24.489
And so I have actually put
products out on my own, which

00:34:24.489 --> 00:34:26.730
is a lot different than
inventing something and

00:34:26.730 --> 00:34:30.860
handing it off to the client
or your boss or something.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.610
And to me, being an entrepreneur
is just whatever

00:34:33.610 --> 00:34:36.460
it is, it's taking full
responsibility for everything.

00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:40.020
If there's a hurricane on the
east coast, it's your

00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:41.460
responsibility if you're
trying to get

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:42.489
your product there.

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:45.070
If your employee doesn't
deliver, it's your

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:46.190
responsibility.

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:49.520
So being an entrepreneur means
taking full responsibility for

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.969
everything.

00:34:50.969 --> 00:34:54.570
And so this is something that
a lot of beers I've come up

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:56.190
with this quote.

00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:58.110
"A man climbs a mountain
because it's there.

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:00.040
A man invents something because
it's not there."

00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.640
And this is just sort of
something in your gut.

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:02.940
It's like, I'm going
to do this, because

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:04.500
it's never been done.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:07.060
I don't know why, it's just some
people like doing this.

00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:08.330
And I have that.

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:11.600
And all these other
people have that.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.420
So that's my presentation.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:17.230
I hope we have some
questions now.

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.970
So the question is, how do
ethics get involved?

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:20.260
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:23.724
To what extent is an inventor
responsible for the ethical

00:35:23.724 --> 00:35:25.137
implications of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:25.137 --> 00:35:26.820
BRETT STERN: I would say,
and I'm going to

00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:28.620
speak for myself now--

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:34.000
I do what I do because my
parents gave me certain values

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.090
and ethics.

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:39.490
And I'm committed to making the
world a better place in a

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:40.540
positive way.

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.520
That's just me personally.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.830
And the things I'm trying
to do, I think,

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:46.300
are helping the world.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:52.220
And when I do a surgical
instrument, those things came

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.190
in front of me all day.

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:56.610
Like, are you extending
someone's life to be good, or

00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:57.920
should they just die?

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:01.120
And these were issues
I'd faced.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.090
It's a challenge.

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:02.710
I don't know.

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:04.110
I don't really have an answer.

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:07.200
I think you have to think of
them, and I think you have to

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:10.310
just personally say to
yourself, do I feel

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:12.800
comfortable putting this out
there in the marketplace?

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:16.940
That being said, when you give
someone a tool, whether it's

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:20.540
digital or analog, you have no
control over how they're

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:22.500
going to use it.

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:25.710
And to not put it out there,
to prevent it out there, I

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:29.120
mean, once you open up that
box, it's out there.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.430
You have no control over it.

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:33.690
And good things can
be used for bad.

00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:34.670
I don't have an answer.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:37.430
I think it's just on a
case by case basis.

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:40.620
You have to feel comfortable
with yourself.

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:44.470
You can't live in
a pure world.

00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:45.690
it's just not pure anymore.

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:49.510
You just have to put it out
there, do your best, and

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:53.000
hopefully it'll be used
for the good of man.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.800
And that's the best
answer I can give.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:59.770
So you were asking me about what
is innovation, and why is

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:02.170
it always commercialization
based?

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:05.240
I think you could invent
something and not

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:07.290
commercialize on it, not bring
it to the marketplace.

00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:10.280
You can have it sit in your
garage, and that's fine.

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.440
It's your decision.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:16.270
I think the reason I wanted
to give that definition is

00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:19.750
because I think the term
inventing, invention,

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:22.760
creativity, innovative, they're
just terms thrown out

00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:23.620
there all day.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:26.810
And hanging out with like-minded
people, we're in

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:29.250
bars, and we're discussing
our projects, and it

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:29.910
always comes up.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:32.090
And it's like, well, I'm
creative, and I'm innovative.

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:33.380
Well, is it the same thing?

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:35.600
And what are the subtleties,
differences?

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.350
And so I just made a definition
up for myself to

00:37:38.350 --> 00:37:41.520
sort of say, when I'm doing
projects, I'm doing the

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.490
invention now.

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:44.720
And now I'm doing
the innovation.

00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.300
And you're wearing
separate hats.

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:48.230
Because when you're doing the
invention side, you're wearing

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:50.635
the technical engineering
design hat.

00:37:50.635 --> 00:37:54.260
But I feel when you're wearing
the innovation hat, you're

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:57.120
wearing the marketing and
the business side.

00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.310
And it just made me feel
comfortable to understand that

00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:01.320
they're two separate things.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:03.740
Because as a designer,
everything is all about

00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:04.950
compromise.

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:06.790
When you're doing art, there's
no compromise.

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:08.420
It's just what you're
doing for yourself.

00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:10.920
When you do design, it's
compromising things.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:15.520
And I think when you're doing
the innovation side, the

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:17.950
invention side is done already,
and you're trying to

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:18.930
get it out there.

00:38:18.930 --> 00:38:22.020
And frankly, I want people to
give me money for the things.

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:23.990
I mean, you guys want people
to give you money for the

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:26.220
things, too, whether it's
directly or indirectly.

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.680
And you create situations where
people give you money

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.690
for your things.

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:30.580
And that's separate.

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:33.480
You don't ask the same people
who are thinking of the

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:37.290
technology side to figure out
ways to give you money side.

00:38:37.290 --> 00:38:39.720
You purposely separate
those two.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.360
And you have to wear two
different hats, because

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.130
they're two different methods.

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:45.650
So that's why I personally, just
me, personally-- again,

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:47.050
it's my definition--

00:38:47.050 --> 00:38:48.520
is I'm able to separate that.

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:50.340
It's like, OK, I've done
the invention side.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:52.310
Now I'm going to go out and
make some money doing it.

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:55.800
And frankly, I like to be
compensated for my work.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:56.740
I think it's fair.

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.380
Just as everyone else
gets compensated.

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:04.400
So I realize that when I'm the
inventing side, I'm sort of

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.150
looking very close down.

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:08.610
I'm looking down at
the drawing board.

00:39:08.610 --> 00:39:11.180
And when I'm doing the
innovation side, I am sort of

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.510
looking at the world
out there.

00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:14.240
I'm saying, hello,
can you hear me?

00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.660
So that's where I feel
comfortable.

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.540
So what tips would I share
as an inventor?

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.470
Well, I had the option of
interviewing myself, because

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:25.630
some of the other "At Work"
books, they did exactly that.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:29.480
I thought it was surreal
to do that.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:35.250
And I felt, maybe, when I did
this project, I think I was

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:36.200
looking for validation.

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.270
Like, I've been doing
this for 25 years.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:39.570
Have I learned anything?

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:43.090
And so these are the masters
and everything.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:45.960
So I felt I was giving
reverence to them.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.650
And when I got to the end of
it-- so all these things?

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:50.890
All those skill sets?

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:52.050
I have all those.

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:53.940
So I felt pretty good
about myself.

00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:57.370
So I feel, yes, I'm
an inventor.

00:39:57.370 --> 00:39:58.950
I could get to wear
the inventor hat.

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:02.050
Whether I have patents enough or
not, I'm still an inventor.

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:03.530
I've made money on
my invention.

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:06.480
So if you get a patent,
are you an inventor?

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:07.830
If you make money, are
you an inventor?

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:08.200
I don't know.

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:09.910
I've done both those things.

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:10.860
So what have I learned?

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:12.850
I've learned all those
things on there.

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:15.370
And I learned it's
a lifestyle.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:20.770
It's something that you're born
with and can be nurtured,

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:24.030
but it's also something you have
to live with 24/7 that

00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:25.500
you just can't really
turn it off.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:30.960
And I think some professions
that you could go in at 9:00

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:34.900
in the morning, hit the time
clock, and at 5:00, come home

00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:38.170
and go out with your buddies and
watch the game, whatever.

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:39.990
And you could sort of
turn your brain off.

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.860
This--

00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:43.800
and this is for all
creative people--

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.740
it's a life thing.

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.360
It's a 24/7 thing.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:52.220
And so that's the best thing I
could say to a young inventor,

00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:55.390
because I had these
conversations, is accept it.

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:56.680
Just, you're weird.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:59.390
You think different than all the
other kids on the block.

00:40:59.390 --> 00:41:00.690
This is how you are.

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:03.770
Try to be around with
like-minded people that don't

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:05.890
think you're so weird and crazy,
that you're thinking

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:07.220
all the time.

00:41:07.220 --> 00:41:09.890
But it's OK to think this way.

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:13.850
And it's really quite
fun after a while.

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:17.480
I've made it through life so far
without ever having a job.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.710
I've worked since I'm 14,
somehow, in the creative

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:22.060
industries, but I've
never had a job.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:25.000
And I could say that
to other people.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.600
Like, you could make a
living doing this.

00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:27.660
And it's not really a living.

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:32.180
I mean, whatever money I make, I
blow it on the next project.

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:33.830
And that's really
important to me.

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:35.650
So I never get comfortable.

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:37.250
I live a very simple life.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:39.810
I have a very low carbon
footprint.

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:41.190
I'm a single guy.

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:43.880
I could take everything that
I've made and just blow it on

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.450
the next thing.

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:46.620
The worst that can happen
is I could fail

00:41:46.620 --> 00:41:47.690
and I'll lose money.

00:41:47.690 --> 00:41:51.130
I'm not going to do anything
wrong or unethical or illegal.

00:41:51.130 --> 00:41:53.250
I know that I'm not going
to be put in jail.

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:55.010
I pay my taxes like
everyone else.

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:56.390
I have health insurance.

00:41:56.390 --> 00:42:01.590
But you can have this life
and live this way.

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:02.020
It's great.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.650
And you could work in a
corporate setting, as a

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:07.350
consulting setting, or as an
entrepreneurial setting.

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:08.220
Whatever it may be.

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:10.210
So go forth and prosper.

00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:11.420
It's possible.

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:14.390
And I think with all the turmoil
we have today, whether

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:17.400
in the world or in our country,
for whatever reasons,

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.640
this is such a great time to
live, because whatever worked

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:23.440
yesterday is not working
tomorrow.

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.860
And I mean, it's just amazing.

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:28.450
And it doesn't matter how old
you are or how young you are

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:31.130
or what education you have,
there's always a way to get

00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:33.760
some money to do something,
whatever way it is.

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:36.270
I mean, whether it's from your
parents, or a credit card, or

00:42:36.270 --> 00:42:38.760
VC, whatever, Kickstarter.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:42.380
There's ways to get money to
fund these projects to just go

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:43.700
into the garage and
make something.

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:47.110
Whether it's digital, analog,
this is the most amazing time

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:47.820
to live right now.

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:50.850
With all the tools that you guys
provide out there into

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:53.530
the marketplace, and all the
technology and tools that

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:56.960
these former guys have
developed and

00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.280
offered to our society.

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:00.540
I mean, it's just so exciting
right now with all the

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:04.940
materials and the technologies
and just things to try.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:08.290
And it doesn't have to
be fiber optics.

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:10.510
It doesn't have to
be RAM memory.

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:14.800
It could be a new bike light,
something like that.

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:17.820
When the inventors created their
projects, were they also

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:20.470
thinking of the innovation
side?

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:21.670
Great question.

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:26.110
And I would say most of the
people I interviewed were in a

00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:29.450
corporate or governmental
or educational setting.

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:32.710
And so, especially in the
corporate setting, you have

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:35.500
all these people out there to
do certain roles, and their

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.680
job was to do the
invention side.

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.960
They would talk with the
marketing side and the sales

00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:44.370
side continuously, and
especially nowadays, where the

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:45.290
people are all brought in.

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:48.300
In fact, they're bringing the
manufacturing people in.

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:50.910
They're bringing everyone in
right from the beginning.

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:53.900
But I would say the actual
inventors don't really have,

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.440
in a corporate setting,
involvement in

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.160
the innovation side.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.745
Tim Leatherman, as an example,
because he was the crazy guy

00:44:01.745 --> 00:44:06.060
in the garage, he was out there
selling it, but he was

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.010
probably the wrong guy to
do that, because he was

00:44:08.010 --> 00:44:09.030
too close to it.

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:12.550
And so most inventors are not
very good sellers of their

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:14.970
ideas, because they're
too wonky.

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:17.210
And they don't really understand
the marketing side

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:18.380
or the selling side of it.

00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:19.840
So you have to be
really careful.

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:23.160
So I say, in a sense, to really
get stuff out there,

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:28.360
systems have to be in place
to separate the tasks.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:34.100
So the question is, how do you
not think so much about the

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:36.360
invention, but the getting
it out there into the

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.130
marketplace?

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:38.380
AUDIENCE: Or almost
[INAUDIBLE].

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:44.080
BRETT STERN: You know, I think
you need to just be a well

00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.270
rounded person.

00:44:45.270 --> 00:44:48.680
And that's a challenge, because
technical people,

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:51.700
especially engineers,
are really focused.

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:53.930
I mean, their whole life has
been getting into tiny little

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:55.510
minutiae details.

00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:58.890
And I think that's a challenge
for people.

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:03.880
I think you just have to network
and to your friends,

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:07.620
and go hike a mountain and
look at the world.

00:45:07.620 --> 00:45:10.080
Go out there and just
see the world.

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:13.610
And I think a lot of technical
people just are marveling at

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:16.100
the technology, and just saying,
gee whiz, this is a

00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.990
great thing that I'm doing
and in fact, never really

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:20.150
want to finish it.

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:24.840
It's like, oh, I can make it
better-- like, 2.0, 2.5, 3.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:26.840
I mean, there's always going
to be something better.

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.010
And so that's what
I was saying,

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:30.020
like, new versus modify.

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:32.020
It's like, there's a point--

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.260
it's interesting, because the
computer industry will just

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:37.910
put stuff out there, and next
year, there's going to be the

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:40.660
upgraded version of that.

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:42.560
And even look at cars.

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:46.020
Every year, there's a new--
there's the 2013 coming out.

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:50.730
And so I think that's just
nature, is that you have to,

00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:51.620
at some point---

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:52.920
this is the way I look at it.

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.530
It's like, you give birth to
your children, and you give

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:58.130
them certain values and morals
and education, and then you

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:00.190
say, OK, go off to college.

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:03.130
And then you could sort of have
control of them, because

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:04.490
you give them money
or something.

00:46:04.490 --> 00:46:07.070
But you don't really have
that much control.

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:08.960
And so there's a point where
you just have to put it out

00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.760
there, whether it's ready or
not, and then learn from that

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.410
experience.

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:14.390
Was it too soon?

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:15.410
Was it too late?

00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:16.380
Did I wait too long?

00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:18.760
Sometimes waiting too
long is a bad thing.

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.010
Sometimes it's too soon.

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:22.320
You put it out there,
and it gets a crappy

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.920
review, and it's sunk.

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.180
You're screwed at that point.

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:26.820
So there's that real
fine line.

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.630
And so you could have a
solution, and it could be

00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:33.130
successful or failure based
on timing, based on the

00:46:33.130 --> 00:46:36.170
marketplace, based on world
events, based on politics,

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:39.350
based on the physical
environment.

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:40.720
I don't know.

00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:42.790
I know all this stuff,
but I know nothing.

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:46.250
It's like there's no
predictability in any of this.

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:50.160
There's no, oh, if I do this,
this will happen.

00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.790
Every time it's completely
different.

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:53.760
And every time I think I learned
something, it's like,

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:54.560
I don't know.

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.560
I mean, the more I learn,
the less I know.

00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:59.270
I mean, it's such a true
proverb right now.

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:01.180
But it's great to keep
learning stuff.

00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:03.160
And you just have
to keep trying.

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:06.890
And I think some people become
successful when they do the

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:08.350
same thing over and
over again.

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:11.950
They sort of stay within that
industry, or that product line

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:12.580
or something.

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:13.860
I don't do that.

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.400
That's my fault.

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:19.360
I get screwed by learning new
stuff all the time, and

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:20.590
learning new experiences.

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:23.810
But that's my thing, and I'm
willing to accept that.

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:25.160
That's OK for me.

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.750
I like doing that.

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:29.450
And it's like the money, I'm
just going to blow it on

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:30.470
another idea.

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:31.120
It's OK.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.155
And somehow I can make
money and just blow

00:47:33.155 --> 00:47:34.190
it on another idea.

00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:36.430
Right now, I'm working on
a bicycle tire project.

00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:37.820
It's fascinating.

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:40.815
I've learned everything there
is about bicycle tires.

00:47:40.815 --> 00:47:43.260
And I'm a cyclist, and I've
never done bike projects

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:45.620
before, and I love riding.

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:48.370
So where do I find knowledge,
or how do I direct it?

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:53.100
Well, first, you can't
rush anything.

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:57.420
I mean, I was in a think tank
consulting for Pfizer doing

00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:58.960
surgical instruments
and medical

00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.570
implants for seven years.

00:48:00.570 --> 00:48:02.650
They hired me because I
knew nothing about it.

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:04.610
They wanted that out of
the box thinking.

00:48:04.610 --> 00:48:08.620
They brought a doctor in to,
like, OK, this is how we do

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:09.780
angioplasty surgery.

00:48:09.780 --> 00:48:10.890
And the next project
would be, this is

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:11.860
how we do hip implants.

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:14.110
And it's like, OK.

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:18.280
But my job, in those situations,
at least, is to

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:20.380
say what if?

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:22.850
Now, it wasn't my job
to be a doctor.

00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:25.740
It wasn't my job to be a
mechanical engineer or a

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:26.760
biomechanical engineer.

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:30.680
It was my job to say, why are
you doing it that way?

00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.590
We went to Japan to
do orthopedics

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:35.180
for the Asian market.

00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:37.140
The first night we there, we
were sitting on the floor in

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:38.450
the restaurant drinking beers.

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:41.260
And I said, do you guys design
these implants for people to

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:42.340
sit on the floors?

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:44.920
And we were all the Americans
in Japan.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:49.000
It's like, who sits on
floors in America?

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:49.850
And that was it.

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:51.360
It was like, my job was done.

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:54.050
Drinking a beer, I said,
do you sit on a floor?

00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:55.170
It's like, no.

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:58.000
Let's design implants for people
to have increased range

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.810
of motion, is really what
it was all about.

00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:03.110
And then looking at the
physiology of the body.

00:49:03.110 --> 00:49:05.180
I didn't have to come
up with a solution.

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:08.580
I'm so far in the front of it.

00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:10.660
There are all these
people behind.

00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:13.430
And I think you need all those
experts to be in the room.

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:16.360
I mean, are you personally
responsible for putting

00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:18.170
something out there into
the marketplace right

00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:19.360
now, here at Google?

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:19.800
You're not.

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.290
You have all these teams of
people that you work on.

00:49:22.290 --> 00:49:25.410
And I think the problem
inventors have is when they

00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:27.740
think they know everything, or
they want to learn everything.

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:30.150
And what happens is they do get
bogged down, and they're

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:32.980
like, oh, I have to go back to
school to become a physicist.

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:34.950
I have to go get my engineering
degree.

00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:37.460
It's like, no, you could just
hire an engineer to do that.

00:49:37.460 --> 00:49:40.730
I mean, I hire people
all the time.

00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:41.740
I'm an industrial designer.

00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:43.850
I don't do any mechanical
drawing anymore.

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:47.240
There's young people out there
that I could hire to do this

00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:48.830
in 15 minutes or an hour.

00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:50.930
I don't have to learn all these
CAD drawings anymore.

00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:53.210
I could say, I want this.

00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:55.100
I give a sketch, and it's like,
the back of a napkin.

00:49:55.100 --> 00:49:56.210
It works fine.

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:58.000
So you find experts.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.930
And that's how you become
the expert.

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:02.210
But it's important for you
to continuously ask

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:03.760
them to those questions.

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:05.490
Like, why are you doing that?

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:07.390
What are the three variables?

00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:09.840
And if they give you something
back and say, OK, here's the

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:12.850
solutions, it's like, why?

00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:13.930
Could we do it some other way?

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.370
And that's what the out of
the box thinking is.

00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:17.800
It's like, why are
you doing this?

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:18.720
And asking this question.

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.180
So ask questions continuously.

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:23.670
And there's nothing wrong
with the question.

00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:25.810
People may get pissed at
you, because they may

00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:26.650
not know the answer.

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:28.460
That's when people get annoyed--
when they don't know

00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:30.460
the answers, and they're
supposed to be the experts.

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:32.720
And then you just find
a different expert.

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.080
So just keep asking questions.

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:35.970
MALE SPEAKER: On that note,
those are some great

00:50:35.970 --> 00:50:37.310
questions, and a great
presentation.

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:37.910
BRETT STERN: Thank you.

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:39.710
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks a lot,
Brett, for speaking with us.

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:43.693
