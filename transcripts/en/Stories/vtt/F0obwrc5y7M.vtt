00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.300
This building stands
as a sort of tombstone

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.220
for a former American giant.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.980
You might pass this
and assume it's

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.830
the byproduct of some
failure, that it probably

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.480
deserved to be forgotten.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.050
But dilapidated,
collapsed, and broken

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.992
doesn't mean it was a failure.

00:00:24.992 --> 00:00:26.450
It doesn't mean it
was unimportant.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.030
This is what is left of
the Bayshore Roundhouse

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.490
on the outskirts of
San Francisco, one

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.180
of the only remaining buildings
of the once flourishing rail

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.310
yard that was referred to as
the jewel of Southern Pacific's

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:41.050
Coast Division.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.390
These walls were put
up over 100 years ago

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.700
on landfill made partially
from the debris of the 1906

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.965
earthquake that devastated
much of the Bay Area.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.320
This is where steam locomotives
were sent for maintenance

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.570
and storage after long journeys
up and down California, where

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.300
tens of thousands of freight
trains were inspected

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.190
and sent off to their
next destination.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.680
3,000 men and women
worked at this train yard.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.180
For 50 years, through
two world wars,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.540
this train yard was
full of steam and smoke

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.520
and the sounds of monstrous
engines and metal tools.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.290
But by the end of the
1950s, steam trains

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.950
were on the way out.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.440
They were replaced with
more efficient diesel trains

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.180
that needed less maintenance.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.300
Trucking became the
standard for shipping,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.270
and people traveled
by car or plane.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.090
Over time, the
Bayshore Roundhouse

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.620
became a storage
facility and a place

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.745
where mighty old steam
engines came to retire.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.180
Finally, on Monday,
October 25, 1982,

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.490
work stopped at the Bayshore
train yard altogether.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.020
It became an
industrial ghost town.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.350
Fences went up,
buildings came down,

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.755
and the train yard
became past tense.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.430
A skeleton, a time
machine, a giant

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.830
defeated by
advancing technology,

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.430
abandoned and discarded but no
less important to our history.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.910
