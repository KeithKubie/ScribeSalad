00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:03.400
Christmas! Ah! It's here!

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.280
[Excited Grunting noises]

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.900
I love it! I love it! I love it!
I hope you're loving it too!

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.040
Man! Just, uh, just wanna give you guys a great big seasons greetings

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.020
Happy Holidays, and of course,
Merry, Merry Christmas!

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:20.940
So excited, always loved this day,
and I have a certain something to share with you,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.820
a little Christmas message that means a lot to me,
hopefully it means a lot to you

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.080
As some of you may or may not know,
I lost my mother this year

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.120
and it was totally out of the blue, it was peacefully,
in her sleep, it just came out of nowhere

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.420
it took us all by surprise, and I wanna share a little something with you

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.860
that I think you'll, uh...
I take to heart at least,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.880
something that she always used to tell me
because she loved my stuff, she loved what I did,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.980
but this was a proud Catholic woman

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.300
and she would always say, "I love your stuff, but why do you have to use such bad language?

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.360
Why do you have to do that?" and years and years, she would always say this,

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.580
and she'd say, "Oh I raised him on Walt Disney!
I raised him in the church! I raised him-!"

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.420
And she'd always say:
"Why do you have to use the F-word?

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.060
Why do you use all those four letter words?",
and what I'd usually bring up, is I'd say

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.240
"Well, how about that scene in Blues Brothers
where the nun is slapping them for swearing?",

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.880
and she goes, "Okay, that's the one time it's funny!",

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.400
and I say, "Well how about that time in Pulp Fiction
when Uma Thurman was OD'ing

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.200
and there was swearing up a storm?" and she's like,
"Okay that's two times it's funny!"

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.620
I'm like "Well, if there can be two times, there can be other times!"

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.280
and then she'd go back to her, "No! It's not funny!
It's offensive," and blah, blah, blah.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:41.320
So something I would do is, 'cause this is something
I didn't see coming when I was doing this,

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.820
is that people would start sending me emails
saying that I helped them through stuff,

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.900
just by having something certain in their lives,
something funny,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.940
something positive that they can constantly go to every week, it's like that little bit of stability

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.980
in an unstable world that... y'know,
or unstable environments that people can be in

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:07.680
so I would take those every year, and I would put them
in a little collection called "They All Like the F Word"

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:15.420
and these are the emails that people sent over the course of a year and I would put them together,

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.640
I'd print them out and I would give them to my mother.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.660
As you can see, this would be the sixth edition, this would've been the sixth year I would have given it to her.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.260
And all the names, by the way, are blotted out, don't worry. I mean, nobody's identity is given away,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.440
but the stories are still there word for word.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.560
And I guess the big thing about it is that, you know, she would see this and she would appreciate it.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.840
I mean, this is one of those people you saw in that "Worst Christmas Special Ever" video, at the end.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.180
She loved to help people, she was a big helper and she loved spreading the idea of just...

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.340
"making people feel better
makes you feel better" kind of thing,

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.000
and you sorta take...

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.500
You need a thing yourself, but you sorta take yourself out of the equation sometimes too,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:06.460
and what really surprised both of us when this whole thing started and just kept going and going and going,

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.720
the whole Nostalgia Critic thing,

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:14.360
is that this was not the original intention, it was definitely to spread laughs and have fun and everything,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.960
but we weren't thinking like, "Oh wow, helping people!"

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.560
because there's stuff
where people talk about, you know,

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:29.900
"I was suicidal, I lost somebody recently, I was in war, and just watching your stuff can really help."

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.380
and, I guess what I'm trying to get across with this, is that it works both ways.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.060
In terms of the whole giving and receiving thing.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.920
And around the holidays, everyone always says "Oh, it's not about the receiving, it's about the giving!",

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.180
and that's true.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:53.060
But, it is also learning how to receive that love too. It's about giving love, but it is also about receiving love,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.520
and not all of us are great at that.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:02.980
Sometimes when we're given a compliment we say, "Oh! Oh, no, it's not! It's, nah, nah," we immediately deny it

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.640
like we're uncomfortable accepting something nice.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.220
And I think Christmas is definitely a time not just giving something nice, but accepting something nice.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.100
That you can be accepting not only of others, but you can be accepting of yourself.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:22.040
And I think this kind of stuff and these kind of stories
kind of show that there are people

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.980
that are having a hard time accepting themselves,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.440
and that...
I kinda feel like when they're going through that,

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.560
they do look for something,
no matter how strange or weird or whatever,

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:41.340
that can help them out, and a lot of people in here say, "Oh! You really helped me! You've changed my life!"

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.720
or something like that, and I'm I wanna say to all of you, you have changed MY life.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.380
And that's what I mean when I say it works both ways,

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.900
because so many of these celebrities always say
"Oh, we'd be nowhere without you!",

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.820
and you think "Well, they have to say that."

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.400
Well, 1) You're right.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.460
2) They don't always,

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.840
because, you know there are some celebrities and people who go through stuff where they can't see it

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.200
or they can't feel it, and that is a shame,

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.800
but there's definitely a large amount that do realize how important you are

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.260
and how important the people that watch, and share and talk about such positive things

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.920
how important they really are.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:27.360
So when people like us say, "it really is all from you guys, and it's so wonderful, and you really are the world"

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.620
I can definitely say, I really mean it.
I know a lot of other people who mean it as well.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.100
So, you know, you can look at this stuff, and you can be like, "Oh you've really helped me through so much stuff."

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:45.060
"You've changed my life." You really have changed my life. You have made so much of my happiness possible.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:54.040
And, you know, if just making these silly videos can make you happy as well, it really is the least I can do

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.040
Because you guys really do help share so much of that love and so much of what Christmas is,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.260
just not around Christmas, but year-round.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:04.260
And it really, really means the world.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.680
I know that's what my mother always tried to get done, tried to spread that love

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.900
and, you know, the idea of sharing and being kind and just how powerful it is to help others

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.060
and how much it comes back and it really does reward you,

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.920
so... it's...

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.400
but it's all in different ways.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.180
It is in such different ways, and I think that is one of the reasons I made this,

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.460
it's because she thought,
"Well, that F-word can't... [trails off]"

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.300
You know? That nobody can like that.
Nobody can get into it.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.800
But people have different languages,
they have different cultures.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.720
And every time I would make this for her,
she would see that,

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.160
she would read these stories,
a lot of times she would read one before going to bed.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.240
She would read an email, and uh...

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:53.140
I really wanted to say that you guys helped with that, you guys constantly help people like me and my mom

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:59.660
see various ways to help, and different cultures,
different languages, just all sorts of variety

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:05.400
and that is so phenomenal and I am just so thankful
to have you guys in my life.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:11.540
And it just means the world to me,
and this would've been year six.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:16.440
And it drives me NUTS that I can't give this to her,
but as you can see I had it made anyway,

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.580
and who knows? Maybe she is seeing it. You know we don't know what happens after this world.

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.380
But... you know.

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.400
It's one of those things where I made it anyway,
not just for her, but for you guys

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.700
because it really, really...

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:34.000
I really mean it when I say you mean the world.
You have changed my life, you mean so much,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.760
I know I'm on repeat right now, but I love saying it, I love saying how much you guys have affected my life, so...

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:45.640
thank you all so much, and just remember that things you never would've thought of

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.000
like, you know, just going around cursing and talking about movies could help people through stuff, y'know?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.220
But I mean, look, this is the sixth edition of this,

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:57.240
and... it's... Those good...

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:03.400
Those good ideas and that bit of kindness that works in ways you're not even aware of so do It anyway,

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.480
do it even if you think it's not working, because the majority of time it is, you're just not aware of it,

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:13.140
and find different ways to do it!
Find ways that maybe nobody has thought about!

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:19.640
There's so much kindness and so much positivity that can be shared and there's so many various ways to do it.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.160
So everybody have a Phenomenal Christmas!

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.240
Keep it in your heart today, keep it in your heart tomorrow, keep it in your heart the whole year-round.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:32.520
As much as you can! You're still human like me, you're gonna make mistakes and we're all gonna have goofups,

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:38.980
but just try your best, man, because you know that effort goes a long way and that trying goes so far.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:43.660
So, thank you all so much
and have a wonderful, wonderful Christmas!

00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:44.960
Take care.
