00:00:00.951 --> 00:00:01.930
 How many countries are there in the world? 

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:04.670
 Simple: Just find a map and count it, right? Do not. 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.219
 Not every map is exactly the same - depending on who you are from, the borders will be different. 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.839
 So, if someone disagrees, should there be an organization that can solve the problem? 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.640
 Go to the United Nations to find a room full of different countries, everyone has a small name brand, and then start counting 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.810
 To get the answer. Of course, the country has come and gone. 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.740
 When making this video, the answer is 193. 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.199
 This is the shortest movie, right? You know that this is not over yet. 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.820
 The United Nations list is not like a student’s book, but more like a club member, not everyone. 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.550
 For example, the Vatican is a country. But when it comes to being a UN member 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.739
 It’s too trendy for them 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.800
 The situation in the Vatican may be a bit complicated, but it is already easy to understand. 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.829
 If it is with other non-members of the United Nations... or "places" 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.359
 The words will be a bit fuzzy. 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:49.460
 Like Kosovo, she wants to join this UN club, but the requirements for membership are these five countries. 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.859
 There is no objection inside. Although the United States, Britain, and France believe 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.879
 Kosovo is a country, but Russia and China think she is only a part of Serbia’s rebellion. 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.460
 Therefore, she refused her loan. For others, only just over half of them recognize Kosovo’s independence. 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.660
 Kosovo, very cute, has a web page that uses the language of the other party to thank each country that recognizes itself. 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.620
 However, Kosovo is not the only one. "Place" wants to be regarded as a real country. 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.830
 Others are [ along the Dniester River], [Republic of Nagorny Karabakh], [Abkhazia], and [South Ossetia]. 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.910
 See who you ask, they may or may not be part of [Madova], [Azerbaijan] or [Georgia]. 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.350
 Two of the countries... have not been recognized as a state by any UN member state, and the other two have only five supporters. 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.810
 However, these four places have their own recognition of each other's national status. 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.330
 There are also [Western Sahara] and [Northern Cyprus] each with their own supporters. 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.820
 At this time, you may think, "OK, honestly, how do you do it? I don't care about these guys. 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.610
 When these are not countries, are these places really countries? If I go to one of the resorts 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.190
 Will she "like" a country? The answer is, "Maybe." 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.130
 These countries are autonomous (to a certain extent) and have a government that issues passports. 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.160
 Although these passports are of limited use. And, see which country you go to 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.680
 They may have more or less control over the territory they claim. 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.590
 You may not be able to find a clear boundary. 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.980
 The reason why a lot of these...the place is a bit fuzzy is that they* are usually* 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.970
 Born in a more recent conflict. 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.390
 This answer may not be helpful in your imagination, but you can think like this: 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.280
 The United States is now clearly a country. In 1776, it was not very good. At the time she was just a 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.500
 The concept in the minds of a class of opposition bastards. She was not immediately recognized as a country, if there was no diplomatic effort 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.640
 The young United States may not have come by itself. 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.469
 It’s like a century after she had a rebel. (Annotation: Refers to the Confederacy) 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.060
 Unlike her sister, she lost in the diplomatic department, so... yeah. 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.709
 In this way, there are many "probable" countries today, and they may be future countries. 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.109
 Like the United States, maybe they are the future Confederate States, but it’s hard to say now. 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.140
 Because these things have to be solved for decades. 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.159
 By the way, these “possible countries” are super-processing for other countries. 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.299
 Your small island country may be too lazy to pay attention to the land far away from him. 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.260
 You still have to decide whether to send or not to send a diplomat, that is to say 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.709
 No action has been made for every territorial dispute in the world*. 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.159
 One of the most embarrassing examples is... Taiwan...oh, sorry, Chinese Taipei, *completely* is part of China, 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.879
 No one will question... (Is China gone?) 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.269
 OK: In any reasonable definition, Taiwan is an independent country and has been maintained for many years. 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.510
 But China just refuses to let go and insists that you call her "Chinese Taipei", and don't forget 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.689
 Who produces your clothes, cutlery, TV, phone, computer, and everything. 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:18.400
 So almost all countries, including the great America, are also happy with her. 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.999
 Although the United States unofficially recognizes Taiwan’s independence and does something unreasonable without such knowledge. 

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:25.749
 For example, sending an aircraft carrier to protect a part of China and avoiding China’s 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:27.019
 Another part of the threat? ? 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.680
 Therefore, an innocent "how many countries" problem led us to a big "third world war: 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.379
 Click here to start the button, this is a bit frustrating, so it is better to continue to go... 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:35.909
 Oh... yes. 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:36.670
 ::唉~:: 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.639
 Stop talking about politics: talk about the higher level concept: the Olympics. From the height of the gods, 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:47.170
 There is no interest in the country at home. "How many Olympics are there?" 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.370
 Two hundred and four? clam? 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.950
 But the Olympics are a bit...special. She defines [Puerto Rico] as a country, 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.719
 Although she is undoubtedly part of the United States, there are [Bermuda] and [Aruba]. 

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:00.419
 Associated with the UK and the Netherlands, there are a bunch of other places willing to 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:04.400
 As a "participating country" to participate in the Olympics, but did not claim independence. 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.389
 It is conceivable that the Olympics include these to increase the number of members so that she can speak "more than 200 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.290
 National competition! But this water-filled list does not include the Vatican. 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.310
 Because of his demographic composition, it is impossible to obtain a gold medal without the help of God. 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.760
 And the Vatican is bringing the problem back to the heart of the puzzle: 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.380
 It is impossible to have a consistent definition of the "country" because your list should contain 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.260
 The Vatican, a country that is the least like a country but still a country, must be eliminated at the same time. 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.060
 The opposite of the Vatican: Hong Kong, a country most like a country, is not a country. 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.060
 And don't forget to mention some seemingly infinite "territory" in the last time. 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.170
 It seems like an independent country, but it doesn't matter. 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.890
 And this has not included the flag that is inserted on the island or the oil rig. 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.350
 Printing a banknote with an inkjet printer at home and claiming that a virtual country is 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.630
 Independent country madman 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.150
 Then there is no list to follow, then where are we? The best answer to this question is: 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.820
 In the foreseeable future, the answer to "how many countries in the world" can be said to be "about 200". 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:57.590
 Then just like this. 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.340
 To be accurate to a few more values, it means that there is more than the reality. 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.320
 Because, after all, the reason why a country is a country depends on other countries 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:14.320
 It is a country.
