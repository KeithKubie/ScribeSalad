right so about 15 years ago I read a
 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.160
right so about 15 years ago I read a
brief history of time and I was

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170
brief history of time and I was
 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.140
brief history of time and I was
impressed that a scientist a very good

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150
impressed that a scientist a very good
 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.720

doing to the public and that at that

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500
doing to the public and that at that
 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.089
doing to the public and that at that
time inspired me to do some of the

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:26.099
time inspired me to do some of the
 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.860
time inspired me to do some of the
things that I'm doing today reaching out

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870
things that I'm doing today reaching out
 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.449

to the public and trying to teach them
 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.979
to the public and trying to teach them
about viruses and I'll tell you a bit

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989
about viruses and I'll tell you a bit
 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.559
about viruses and I'll tell you a bit
about that later what I would like to do

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569
about that later what I would like to do
 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.520
about that later what I would like to do
today is to give you an overview of the

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.990
his is he is clearly describing
poliomyelitis in this book and from the

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000
poliomyelitis in this book and from the
 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.030
poliomyelitis in this book and from the
Egyptian steel up until this point as we

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040
Egyptian steel up until this point as we
 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.370
Egyptian steel up until this point as we
said we have sporadic descriptions of

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380
said we have sporadic descriptions of
 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.620
said we have sporadic descriptions of
what could be this disease so I suspect

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630
what could be this disease so I suspect
 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.300
what could be this disease so I suspect
it was around for a long time but it was

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310
it was around for a long time but it was
 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.730
it was around for a long time but it was
quite rare and did not occur in

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740
quite rare and did not occur in
 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:07.409
quite rare and did not occur in
epidemics as we will see later epidemic

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419
epidemics as we will see later epidemic
 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.600
epidemics as we will see later epidemic
poliomyelitis began at the end of the

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610
poliomyelitis began at the end of the
 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.450
poliomyelitis began at the end of the
1800s and by epidemics of course we mean

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460
1800s and by epidemics of course we mean
 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.030
1800s and by epidemics of course we mean
larger numbers of cases not individual

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040
larger numbers of cases not individual
 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.340
larger numbers of cases not individual
cases here and there the first one in

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350
cases here and there the first one in
 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.200
cases here and there the first one in
Sweden in eighteen sixty eight fourteen

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210
Sweden in eighteen sixty eight fourteen
 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.090
Sweden in eighteen sixty eight fourteen
cases and then also in 1881 the first in

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100
cases and then also in 1881 the first in
 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.100
cases and then also in 1881 the first in
the US was in Vermont in 1894 132 cases

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110
the US was in Vermont in 1894 132 cases
 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.770
the US was in Vermont in 1894 132 cases
and I was studied by the local coroner

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780
and I was studied by the local coroner
 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.750
and I was studied by the local coroner
and he made some very astute

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:33.760
and he made some very astute
 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.850
and he made some very astute
observations about the disease which can

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860
observations about the disease which can
 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.100
observations about the disease which can
find in the literature which is which

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110
find in the literature which is which
 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.740
find in the literature which is which
have helped us understand the nature of

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750
have helped us understand the nature of
 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.010
have helped us understand the nature of
it to this day an important observation

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020
it to this day an important observation
 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.250
it to this day an important observation
was made by Swedish physician in 1887

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260
was made by Swedish physician in 1887
 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.790
was made by Swedish physician in 1887
who noted an initial systemic phase of

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800
who noted an initial systemic phase of
 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.060
who noted an initial systemic phase of
the disease that is generalized symptoms

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070
the disease that is generalized symptoms
 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.810
the disease that is generalized symptoms
fever malaise aches and pains and

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820
fever malaise aches and pains and
 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.520
fever malaise aches and pains and
involvement of the central nervous

00:05:59.520 --> 00:05:59.530
involvement of the central nervous
 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:00.250
involvement of the central nervous
system

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260
system
 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.290
system
that is the paralysis seemed to be a

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300
that is the paralysis seemed to be a
 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.840
that is the paralysis seemed to be a
complication it was very astute he

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850
complication it was very astute he
 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.700
complication it was very astute he
noticed it didn't happen in everyone and

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710
noticed it didn't happen in everyone and
 

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.500
noticed it didn't happen in everyone and
so he said maybe it's just a

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510
so he said maybe it's just a
 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:10.000
so he said maybe it's just a
complication and we will get back to

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010
complication and we will get back to
 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.470
complication and we will get back to
this of course a bit later we now call

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:14.480
this of course a bit later we now call
 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.740
this of course a bit later we now call
polio a disease of modern sanitation so

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750
polio a disease of modern sanitation so
 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.570
polio a disease of modern sanitation so
I've just told you around the turn of

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580
I've just told you around the turn of
 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.480
I've just told you around the turn of
the 20th century began to emerge an

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490
the 20th century began to emerge an
 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.460
the 20th century began to emerge an
epidemic form and we believe this is

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470
epidemic form and we believe this is
 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.440
epidemic form and we believe this is
because of the improved sanitation that

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450
because of the improved sanitation that
 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.750
because of the improved sanitation that
was developed around that time so before

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760
was developed around that time so before
 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.040
was developed around that time so before
that year polio circulated freely in the

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:32.050
that year polio circulated freely in the
 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.230
that year polio circulated freely in the
population it's spread by the fecal-oral

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240
population it's spread by the fecal-oral
 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.500
population it's spread by the fecal-oral
route as we will see and it infected

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:38.510
route as we will see and it infected
 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.920
route as we will see and it infected
most children shortly after birth and so

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:41.930
most children shortly after birth and so
 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:44.500
most children shortly after birth and so
they became immunized when we improved

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:44.510
they became immunized when we improved
 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.890
they became immunized when we improved
sanitation that delayed infection until

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:47.900
sanitation that delayed infection until
 

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:50.950
sanitation that delayed infection until
later in life and one theory is that the

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:50.960
later in life and one theory is that the
 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.960
later in life and one theory is that the
children at birth are given antibodies

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:52.970
children at birth are given antibodies
 

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.900
children at birth are given antibodies
from their mother that protect them

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:54.910
from their mother that protect them
 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.570
from their mother that protect them
against the disease so if these children

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:58.580
against the disease so if these children
 

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.060
against the disease so if these children
are infected early on they're protected

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:01.070
are infected early on they're protected
 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.320
are infected early on they're protected
but they become they make their own

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.330
but they become they make their own
 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.240
but they become they make their own
immune response and become immune to the

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.250
immune response and become immune to the
 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.700
immune response and become immune to the
infection if you delay infection till

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:06.710
infection if you delay infection till
 

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.500
infection if you delay infection till
later in life when they no longer have

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:08.510
later in life when they no longer have
 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.420
later in life when they no longer have
maternal antibodies is these begin to

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430
maternal antibodies is these begin to
 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.300
maternal antibodies is these begin to
decline at birth and are gone after a

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.310
decline at birth and are gone after a
 

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.910
decline at birth and are gone after a
few months then you will get infection

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:15.920
few months then you will get infection
 

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.190
few months then you will get infection
and disease so that's why we call it a

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:18.200
and disease so that's why we call it a
 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.900
and disease so that's why we call it a
disease of modern sanitation and there's

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:19.910
disease of modern sanitation and there's
 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.780
disease of modern sanitation and there's
some epidemiological data that that have

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:22.790
some epidemiological data that that have
 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.010
some epidemiological data that that have
been collected over the years that

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:24.020
been collected over the years that
 

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.370
been collected over the years that
support this hypothesis the virus was

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:27.380
support this hypothesis the virus was
 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:30.130
support this hypothesis the virus was
isolated by Karl Landsteiner who was

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:30.140
isolated by Karl Landsteiner who was
 

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.280
isolated by Karl Landsteiner who was
also well known for studying blood group

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:33.290
also well known for studying blood group

also well known for studying blood group
substances he was a Viennese physician

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:36.710
substances he was a Viennese physician
 

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.020
substances he was a Viennese physician
he isolated the virus in 1908 and what

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:41.030
he isolated the virus in 1908 and what
 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.360
he isolated the virus in 1908 and what
he did was he took the spinal cord of a

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:43.370
he did was he took the spinal cord of a
 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.640
he did was he took the spinal cord of a
boy who had died of polio he grounded up

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:45.650
boy who had died of polio he grounded up
 

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:49.000
boy who had died of polio he grounded up
and he filtered it this time we already

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:49.010
and he filtered it this time we already
 

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.560
and he filtered it this time we already
knew that there were agents called

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:50.570
knew that there were agents called
 

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.860
knew that there were agents called
viruses and they were defined by the

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:53.870
viruses and they were defined by the
 

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.350
viruses and they were defined by the
their ability to pass through a very

small filter these were porcelain
filters that were manufactured at the

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.170
filters that were manufactured at the
 

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.710
filters that were manufactured at the
time and we now know that they had a

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720
time and we now know that they had a
 

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.370
time and we now know that they had a
pore size of about point 2 microns so he

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:06.380
pore size of about point 2 microns so he
 

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.430
pore size of about point 2 microns so he
found that if he filtered the extract of

found that if he filtered the extract of
 

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.960
found that if he filtered the extract of
spinal cord through this filter the

00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:10.970
spinal cord through this filter the
 

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.399
spinal cord through this filter the
filter would retain bacteria and fun

the lesions that can be seen in human
 

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:48.259
the lesions that can be seen in human
patients of polio so this was indication

00:08:48.259 --> 00:08:48.269
patients of polio so this was indication
 

00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:50.629
patients of polio so this was indication
that he passed the agent he suggested

00:08:50.629 --> 00:08:50.639
that he passed the agent he suggested
 

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:53.629
that he passed the agent he suggested
that it was caused by a virus he was

00:08:53.629 --> 00:08:53.639
that it was caused by a virus he was
 

00:08:53.639 --> 00:08:55.519
that it was caused by a virus he was
also able to pass it from monkey too

00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:55.529
also able to pass it from monkey too
 

00:08:55.529 --> 00:08:57.439
also able to pass it from monkey too
monkey he took the monkeys who were

00:08:57.439 --> 00:08:57.449
monkey he took the monkeys who were
 

00:08:57.449 --> 00:08:59.119
monkey he took the monkeys who were
paralyzed ground up their spinal cords

00:08:59.119 --> 00:08:59.129
paralyzed ground up their spinal cords
 

00:08:59.129 --> 00:09:01.009
paralyzed ground up their spinal cords
filtered them and passed it from monkey

00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:01.019
filtered them and passed it from monkey
 

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:03.259
filtered them and passed it from monkey
too monkey in fact for many years this

00:09:03.259 --> 00:09:03.269
too monkey in fact for many years this
 

00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:04.879
too monkey in fact for many years this
is how virus stocks were maintained

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:04.889
is how virus stocks were maintained
 

00:09:04.889 --> 00:09:06.259
is how virus stocks were maintained
there were no refrigerators or freezers

00:09:06.259 --> 00:09:06.269
there were no refrigerators or freezers
 

00:09:06.269 --> 00:09:09.860
there were no refrigerators or freezers
at this time so to keep a virus stock

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:09.870
at this time so to keep a virus stock
 

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.319
at this time so to keep a virus stock
you've kept it in an animal you infected

00:09:12.319 --> 00:09:12.329
you've kept it in an animal you infected
 

00:09:12.329 --> 00:09:14.240
you've kept it in an animal you infected
a monkey you incubated it for a week or

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:14.250
a monkey you incubated it for a week or
 

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.850
a monkey you incubated it for a week or
two when the monkey became paralyzed you

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:16.860
two when the monkey became paralyzed you
 

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.860
two when the monkey became paralyzed you
would sacrifice it make an extract and

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:18.870
would sacrifice it make an extract and
 

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.069
would sacrifice it make an extract and
pass it to the next monkey and this went

00:09:22.069 --> 00:09:22.079
pass it to the next monkey and this went
 

00:09:22.079 --> 00:09:24.019
pass it to the next monkey and this went
on for quite a few years and in fact it

00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:24.029
on for quite a few years and in fact it
 

00:09:24.029 --> 00:09:26.629
on for quite a few years and in fact it
resulted in selection for some very odd

00:09:26.629 --> 00:09:26.639
resulted in selection for some very odd
 

00:09:26.639 --> 00:09:29.210
resulted in selection for some very odd
viruses with unusual properties being

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:29.220
viruses with unusual properties being
 

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.480
viruses with unusual properties being
passed this way from monkey too monkey

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:31.490
passed this way from monkey too monkey
 

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.920
passed this way from monkey too monkey
so let's take a little diversion now

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:33.930
so let's take a little diversion now
 

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.189
so let's take a little diversion now
look at the virus that Karl Landsteiner

00:09:36.189 --> 00:09:36.199
look at the virus that Karl Landsteiner
 

00:09:36.199 --> 00:09:38.059
look at the virus that Karl Landsteiner
discovered we're going to go into a

00:09:38.059 --> 00:09:38.069
discovered we're going to go into a
 

00:09:38.069 --> 00:09:41.420
discovered we're going to go into a
little biology of the virus we classify

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:41.430
little biology of the virus we classify
 

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:44.870
little biology of the virus we classify
viruses in a linnaean fashion and we put

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880
viruses in a linnaean fashion and we put
 

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.389
viruses in a linnaean fashion and we put
them in families and the families are

00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:47.399
them in families and the families are
 

00:09:47.399 --> 00:09:50.179
them in families and the families are
ending in AE and so the family that

00:09:50.179 --> 00:09:50.189
ending in AE and so the family that
 

00:09:50.189 --> 00:09:52.429
ending in AE and so the family that
includes polio is called the peak corna

00:09:52.429 --> 00:09:52.439
includes polio is called the peak corna
 

00:09:52.439 --> 00:09:55.400
includes polio is called the peak corna
very day yeah this was a name given to

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:55.410
very day yeah this was a name given to
 

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.530
very day yeah this was a name given to
the virus many many years after its

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:57.540
the virus many many years after its
 

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:59.269
the virus many many years after its
discovery and it refers to the fact that

00:09:59.269 --> 00:09:59.279
discovery and it refers to the fact that
 

00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:01.730
discovery and it refers to the fact that
they're very small Pico and their

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:01.740
they're very small Pico and their
 

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:06.769
they're very small Pico and their
nucleic acid is RNA and now in this

00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:06.779
nucleic acid is RNA and now in this
 

00:10:06.779 --> 00:10:09.170
nucleic acid is RNA and now in this
family just so that you have a reference

00:10:09.170 --> 00:10:09.180
family just so that you have a reference
 

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.799
family just so that you have a reference
there are a number of genera which in

00:10:12.799 --> 00:10:12.809
there are a number of genera which in
 

00:10:12.809 --> 00:10:15.470
there are a number of genera which in
turn contain different kinds of viruses

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480
turn contain different kinds of viruses
 

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.749
turn contain different kinds of viruses
different species of viruses if you will

00:10:17.749 --> 00:10:17.759
different species of viruses if you will
 

00:10:17.759 --> 00:10:20.600
different species of viruses if you will
so here we have the enterovirus genus

00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:20.610
so here we have the enterovirus genus
 

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.780
so here we have the enterovirus genus
which contains the polio viruses there

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:23.790
which contains the polio viruses there
 

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.380
which contains the polio viruses there
are also a variety of other viruses

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:26.390
are also a variety of other viruses
 

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:28.630
are also a variety of other viruses
in this enterovirus genus it was

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640
in this enterovirus genus it was
 

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.340
in this enterovirus genus it was
originally named because the viruses

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:30.350
originally named because the viruses
 

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.080
originally named because the viruses
passed through your intestinal tract

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:32.090
passed through your intestinal tract
 

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:35.440
passed through your intestinal tract
when they infect you but a number of

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:35.450
when they infect you but a number of
 

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.900
when they infect you but a number of
years ago with the advent of nucleic

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:37.910
years ago with the advent of nucleic
 

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.690
years ago with the advent of nucleic
acid sequence analysis all these viruses

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:40.700
acid sequence analysis all these viruses
 

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.500
acid sequence analysis all these viruses
were reclassified and now we include in

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:44.510
were reclassified and now we include in
 

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:48.280
were reclassified and now we include in
the enterovirus genus the rhinoviruses

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:48.290
the enterovirus genus the rhinoviruses
 

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:50.410
the enterovirus genus the rhinoviruses
which are respiratory tract pathogens

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:50.420
which are respiratory tract pathogens
 

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.320
which are respiratory tract pathogens
this is very odd to me because

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:52.330
this is very odd to me because
 

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.280
this is very odd to me because
rhinovirus has nothing to do with the

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:54.290
rhinovirus has nothing to do with the
 

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.990
rhinovirus has nothing to do with the
enteric track so to put it in an

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000
enteric track so to put it in an
 

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.480
enteric track so to put it in an
enterovirus genus seems odd but we are

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:58.490
enterovirus genus seems odd but we are
 

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:00.600
enterovirus genus seems odd but we are
now at the victim of the

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:00.610
now at the victim of the
 

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.310
now at the victim of the
bioinformaticians we tell us where our

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:03.320
bioinformaticians we tell us where our
 

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.650
bioinformaticians we tell us where our
viruses must be classified so that's

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:05.660
viruses must be classified so that's
 

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.390
viruses must be classified so that's
polio they and their many other general

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:07.400
polio they and their many other general
 

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.550
polio they and their many other general
in the book or no viruses with a variety

00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:09.560
in the book or no viruses with a variety
 

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.580
in the book or no viruses with a variety

pathogens but that's all we'll say about

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:14.270
pathogens but that's all we'll say about
 

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.200
pathogens but that's all we'll say about
that for now these viruses are quite

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:17.210
that for now these viruses are quite
 

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.610
that for now these viruses are quite
small they're 30 nanometers in diameter

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:20.620
small they're 30 nanometers in diameter
 

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.380
small they're 30 nanometers in diameter
which is on the small side for viruses

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:23.390
which is on the small side for viruses
 

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:25.390
which is on the small side for viruses
about the smallest viruses are about 20

00:11:25.390 --> 00:11:25.400
about the smallest viruses are about 20
 

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.810
about the smallest viruses are about 20
nanometers the biggest star over 750

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:28.820
nanometers the biggest star over 750
 

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:32.350
nanometers the biggest star over 750
nanometers and this is a photograph of

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:32.360
nanometers and this is a photograph of
 

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.450
nanometers and this is a photograph of
poliovirus taken in the electron

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:34.460
poliovirus taken in the electron
 

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.920
poliovirus taken in the electron
microscope you can see they are

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:35.930
microscope you can see they are
 

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.770
microscope you can see they are
spherical particles and they have some

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:38.780
spherical particles and they have some
 

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.720
spherical particles and they have some
surface definition that is because the

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:40.730
surface definition that is because the
 

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:45.430
surface definition that is because the
surface is irregular in 1985 the

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440
surface is irregular in 1985 the
 

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.320
surface is irregular in 1985 the
three-dimensional structure of this

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:47.330
three-dimensional structure of this
 

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.630
three-dimensional structure of this
virus was determined by x-ray

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:49.640
virus was determined by x-ray
 

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.390
virus was determined by x-ray
crystallography so what that means is

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:52.400
crystallography so what that means is
 

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:54.970
crystallography so what that means is
that we could determine the position of

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:54.980
that we could determine the position of
 

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.780
that we could determine the position of
every atom in this capsid this is the

00:11:58.780 --> 00:11:58.790
every atom in this capsid this is the
 

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:01.300
every atom in this capsid this is the
shell that comprises the virus in

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:01.310
shell that comprises the virus in
 

00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:05.020
shell that comprises the virus in
three-dimensional space so polio viruses

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:05.030
three-dimensional space so polio viruses
 

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.210
three-dimensional space so polio viruses
are made up of four different proteins

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:07.220
are made up of four different proteins
 

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:10.630
are made up of four different proteins
they're called VP 1 through 4 and these

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:10.640
they're called VP 1 through 4 and these
 

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.930
they're called VP 1 through 4 and these
are repeated 60 times each to form this

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:13.940
are repeated 60 times each to form this
 

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:15.610
are repeated 60 times each to form this
shell this happens to be an icosahedron

00:12:15.610 --> 00:12:15.620
shell this happens to be an icosahedron
 

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:18.550
shell this happens to be an icosahedron
which is the best kind of geometric

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560
which is the best kind of geometric
 

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.310
which is the best kind of geometric
figure to make a virus particle of all

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:21.320
figure to make a virus particle of all
 

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.640
figure to make a virus particle of all
the solids that we know of only the

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:24.650
the solids that we know of only the
 

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:27.220
the solids that we know of only the
icosahedron is used to build viruses and

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:27.230
icosahedron is used to build viruses and
 

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:29.140
icosahedron is used to build viruses and
we think that's because it's the best

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:29.150
we think that's because it's the best
 

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:32.170
we think that's because it's the best
way to make a stable particle by

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:32.180
way to make a stable particle by
 

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.780
way to make a stable particle by
repeating subunits so you take three

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:34.790
repeating subunits so you take three
 

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:36.220
repeating subunits so you take three
four different viral proteins and you

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:36.230
four different viral proteins and you
 

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:38.380
four different viral proteins and you
repeat them 60 times you build this

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:38.390

that will happen is that this RNA is
translated into protein remember you

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:08.950
translated into protein remember you
 

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.070
translated into protein remember you
make that long protein and then you chop

00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:11.080
make that long protein and then you chop
 

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.050
make that long protein and then you chop
it up to make all the individual

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:13.060
it up to make all the individual
 

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:16.260
it up to make all the individual
proteins that you need the virus also

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:16.270
proteins that you need the virus also
 

00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:18.420
proteins that you need the virus also
needs to make more of its nucleic acid

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:18.430
needs to make more of its nucleic acid
 

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.000
needs to make more of its nucleic acid
and so what it does is take that that

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:21.010
and so what it does is take that that
 

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:25.410
and so what it does is take that that
initial RNA and it makes copies of it so

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:25.420
initial RNA and it makes copies of it so
 

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.660
initial RNA and it makes copies of it so
makes a copy once and then again to make

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:27.670
makes a copy once and then again to make
 

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:29.580
makes a copy once and then again to make
the right polarity and then these

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:29.590
the right polarity and then these
 

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:31.980
the right polarity and then these
eventually assemble with new proteins to

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:31.990
eventually assemble with new proteins to
 

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:33.810
eventually assemble with new proteins to
make new virus particles and then at

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:33.820
make new virus particles and then at
 

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.970
make new virus particles and then at
some point the cell bursts open the cell

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:35.980
some point the cell bursts open the cell
 

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.730
some point the cell bursts open the cell
dies and a new crop of viruses is

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:38.740
dies and a new crop of viruses is
 

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:42.150
dies and a new crop of viruses is
ejected and this for polio takes about

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:42.160
ejected and this for polio takes about
 

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:44.310
ejected and this for polio takes about
six to eight hours it's a very quickly

00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320
six to eight hours it's a very quickly
 

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:48.240
six to eight hours it's a very quickly
replicating virus and that is consistent

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:48.250
replicating virus and that is consistent
 

00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:50.640
replicating virus and that is consistent
with it causing an acute infection in

00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:50.650
with it causing an acute infection in
 

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:54.290
with it causing an acute infection in
people one that progresses very rapidly

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:54.300
people one that progresses very rapidly
 

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.750
people one that progresses very rapidly
now what does this do in people so this

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:57.760
now what does this do in people so this
 

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.680
now what does this do in people so this
virus causes poliomyelitis this is a

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:01.690
virus causes poliomyelitis this is a
 

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.560
virus causes poliomyelitis this is a
disease we acquire when we ingest the

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:04.570
disease we acquire when we ingest the
 

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.630
disease we acquire when we ingest the
virus so we show it here here are free

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640
virus so we show it here here are free
 

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:10.040
virus so we show it here here are free
virus particles you ingest them

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:10.050
virus particles you ingest them
 

00:21:10.050 --> 00:21:13.190
virus particles you ingest them
and they can replicate in the epithelial

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200
and they can replicate in the epithelial
 

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.190
and they can replicate in the epithelial
cells that line your element alimentary

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200
cells that line your element alimentary
 

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:19.370
cells that line your element alimentary
tract so this is an enterica iris it can

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:19.380
tract so this is an enterica iris it can
 

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:22.430
tract so this is an enterica iris it can
replicate in your upper alimentary tract

00:21:22.430 --> 00:21:22.440
replicate in your upper alimentary tract
 

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.560
replicate in your upper alimentary tract
or can make its way into the intestines

00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:24.570
or can make its way into the intestines
 

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:27.260
or can make its way into the intestines
and replicate there as well so the virus

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:27.270
and replicate there as well so the virus
 

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.970
and replicate there as well so the virus
can pass through your stomach which of

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:28.980
can pass through your stomach which of
 

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:31.190
can pass through your stomach which of
course is acidic you can pass through

00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200
course is acidic you can pass through
 

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.460
course is acidic you can pass through
the small intestine which is alkaline in

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:34.470
the small intestine which is alkaline in
 

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:36.890
the small intestine which is alkaline in
the very beginning and it has no problem

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:36.900
the very beginning and it has no problem
 

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:39.170
the very beginning and it has no problem
whatsoever it is incredibly resistant

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:39.180
whatsoever it is incredibly resistant
 

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.360
whatsoever it is incredibly resistant
and so this is one of the reasons why

00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:41.370
and so this is one of the reasons why
 

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.910
and so this is one of the reasons why
this is so easily transmitted in nature

00:21:43.910 --> 00:21:43.920
this is so easily transmitted in nature
 

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.520
this is so easily transmitted in nature
is that is a physically very resilient

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:46.530
is that is a physically very resilient
 

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:50.090
is that is a physically very resilient
virus particle so the virus enters these

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:50.100
virus particle so the virus enters these
 

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.580
virus particle so the virus enters these
cells and your mucosal surfaces in your

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:52.590
cells and your mucosal surfaces in your
 

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:55.100
cells and your mucosal surfaces in your
alimentary tract than it reproduces in

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:55.110
alimentary tract than it reproduces in
 

00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:57.110
alimentary tract than it reproduces in
them following the scheme that I just

00:21:57.110 --> 00:21:57.120
them following the scheme that I just
 

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.300
them following the scheme that I just
showed you it enters those cells makes

00:21:59.300 --> 00:21:59.310
showed you it enters those cells makes
 

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.760
showed you it enters those cells makes
more virus particles then those cells

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:01.770
more virus particles then those cells
 

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:05.360
more virus particles then those cells
are destroyed as the viruses replicate

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:05.370
are destroyed as the viruses replicate
 

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:08.000
are destroyed as the viruses replicate
in these cells they are shed into your

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.010
in these cells they are shed into your
 

00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.010
in these cells they are shed into your
intestines and eventually pass into the

00:22:10.010 --> 00:22:10.020
intestines and eventually pass into the
 

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:12.770
intestines and eventually pass into the
feces all right and that is how viruses

00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:12.780
feces all right and that is how viruses
 

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:14.930
feces all right and that is how viruses
spread from one person to another bite

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:14.940
spread from one person to another bite
 

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.450
spread from one person to another bite
what we call fecal-oral contamination so

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:17.460
what we call fecal-oral contamination so
 

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:19.250
what we call fecal-oral contamination so
somehow the virus and the feces gets

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:19.260
somehow the virus and the feces gets
 

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.230
somehow the virus and the feces gets
into the mouth of someone else and

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240
into the mouth of someone else and
 

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.390
into the mouth of someone else and
children are very apt to do this when

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:23.400
children are very apt to do this when
 

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.170
children are very apt to do this when
they're playing or not not being very

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:26.180
they're playing or not not being very
 

00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.430
they're playing or not not being very
hygienic and and that's one of the main

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440
hygienic and and that's one of the main
 

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.340
hygienic and and that's one of the main
ways that the virus is transmitted in

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:31.350
ways that the virus is transmitted in
 

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:33.530
ways that the virus is transmitted in
addition as the virus is multiplying in

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:33.540
addition as the virus is multiplying in
 

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:34.970
addition as the virus is multiplying in
these cells it also gets into your

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:34.980
these cells it also gets into your
 

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:37.490
these cells it also gets into your
bloodstream as it destroys these cells

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:37.500
bloodstream as it destroys these cells
 

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.250
bloodstream as it destroys these cells
it can go beneath the mucosal layer and

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:40.260
it can go beneath the mucosal layer and
 

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:41.900
it can go beneath the mucosal layer and
just beneath here there are lymph

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:41.910
just beneath here there are lymph
 

00:22:41.910 --> 00:22:43.700
just beneath here there are lymph
capillaries which are very permeable

they can tape up the virus the virus

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:46.110
they can tape up the virus the virus
 

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:48.230
they can tape up the virus the virus
travels from the lymph system into the

the blood so shortly after infection you
have virus in your bloodstream when

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:57.750
have virus in your bloodstream when
 

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:59.450
have virus in your bloodstream when
viruses are into your blood they can get

00:22:59.450 --> 00:22:59.460
viruses are into your blood they can get
 

00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:01.780
viruses are into your blood they can get
anywhere and that's not a good thing

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:01.790
anywhere and that's not a good thing
 

00:23:01.790 --> 00:23:05.540
anywhere and that's not a good thing
poliovirus doesn't end up everywhere it

you become paralyzed and typically you

00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:07.830
you become paralyzed and typically you
 

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:11.089
you become paralyzed and typically you
have lower limb paralysis with polio not

these many more in science and it takes

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:12.390
these many more in science and it takes

these many more in science and it takes
the course of a polio infection we have

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:14.460
the course of a polio infection we have

the course of a polio infection we have
days here on the top the phase of

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:17.400
days here on the top the phase of
 

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.340
days here on the top the phase of
infection and what's going on in terms

00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:19.350
infection and what's going on in terms
 

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:23.260
infection and what's going on in terms
of temperature virus in various places

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:23.270
of temperature virus in various places
 

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:28.160
of temperature virus in various places
and also virus in the cns so let's let's

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:28.170
and also virus in the cns so let's let's
 

00:27:28.170 --> 00:27:30.110
and also virus in the cns so let's let's
track this through and this will help us

00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120
track this through and this will help us
 

00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.210
track this through and this will help us
understand the disease so here we have

00:27:32.210 --> 00:27:32.220
understand the disease so here we have
 

00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:36.260
understand the disease so here we have
exposure to the virus starting here for

there's no sign that anything
is going on and then after about a week

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:41.910
is going on and then after about a week
 

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.780
is going on and then after about a week
or so that can vary of course you have a

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:44.790
or so that can vary of course you have a
 

00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:47.450

spike in temperature here you have

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:47.460
spike in temperature here you have
 

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.190
spike in temperature here you have
headaches sore throat nausea these are

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200
headaches sore throat nausea these are
 

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.690
headaches sore throat nausea these are
systemic symptoms they could be almost

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:50.700
systemic symptoms they could be almost
 

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.940
systemic symptoms they could be almost
any virus infection they could be flu in

00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:52.950
any virus infection they could be flu in
 

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:54.560
any virus infection they could be flu in
fact so you can't really tell that this

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:54.570
fact so you can't really tell that this
 

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:57.950
fact so you can't really tell that this
is polio at the same time you have virus

00:27:57.950 --> 00:27:57.960
is polio at the same time you have virus
 

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:00.230
is polio at the same time you have virus
in your throat you can see the rise of

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240
in your throat you can see the rise of
 

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:02.870
in your throat you can see the rise of
virus in throat secretions it's this

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880
virus in throat secretions it's this
 

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.450
virus in throat secretions it's this
curve and here's a virus throat

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:05.460
curve and here's a virus throat
 

00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:07.700
curve and here's a virus throat
secretions here virus in the feces so

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:07.710
secretions here virus in the feces so
 

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:09.110
secretions here virus in the feces so
very early on when you have these

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120
very early on when you have these
 

00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:11.810
very early on when you have these
initial symptoms you have virus in your

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:11.820
initial symptoms you have virus in your
 

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.330
initial symptoms you have virus in your
throat and feces so you're already

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:14.340
throat and feces so you're already
 

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:17.060
throat and feces so you're already
shedding virus but no one knows that you

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:17.070
shedding virus but no one knows that you
 

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:18.890
shedding virus but no one knows that you
have polio this is very important

00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:18.900
have polio this is very important
 

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.330
have polio this is very important
because this is how its spread so

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:20.340
because this is how its spread so
 

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.850
because this is how its spread so
effectively there's no way to know that

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.860
effectively there's no way to know that
 

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.650
effectively there's no way to know that
a person coughing with a sore throat has

00:28:24.650 --> 00:28:24.660
a person coughing with a sore throat has
 

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.990
a person coughing with a sore throat has
a polio infection until much later and

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000
a polio infection until much later and
 

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.980
a polio infection until much later and
by then the virus has spread to others

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:29.990
by then the virus has spread to others
 

00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:32.900
by then the virus has spread to others
at this time when you have this initial

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:32.910
at this time when you have this initial
 

00:28:32.910 --> 00:28:35.330
at this time when you have this initial
systemic bout you have virus in the

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:35.340
systemic bout you have virus in the
 

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.760
systemic bout you have virus in the
blood you see there's a peek here it

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:37.770
blood you see there's a peek here it
 

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.910
blood you see there's a peek here it
peaks and then goes down okay so in most

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:40.920
peaks and then goes down okay so in most
 

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.000
peaks and then goes down okay so in most
of the cases 99 out of 100 cases that is

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:44.010
of the cases 99 out of 100 cases that is
 

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.070
of the cases 99 out of 100 cases that is
the end of the infection you will

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080
the end of the infection you will
 

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.290
the end of the infection you will
recover and you will never know you had

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:48.300
recover and you will never know you had
 

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.930
recover and you will never know you had
polio unless you look for antibodies to

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:50.940
polio unless you look for antibodies to
 

00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:53.330
polio unless you look for antibodies to
the virus which you can find later in

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:53.340
the virus which you can find later in
 

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.480
the virus which you can find later in
the serum but in about one out of a

00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:56.490
the serum but in about one out of a
 

00:28:56.490 --> 00:28:58.790
the serum but in about one out of a
hundred or maybe 200 infections the

00:28:58.790 --> 00:28:58.800
hundred or maybe 200 infections the
 

00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.770
hundred or maybe 200 infections the
virus somehow gets its way into the

00:29:00.770 --> 00:29:00.780
virus somehow gets its way into the
 

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:03.230
virus somehow gets its way into the
central nervous system remember it goes

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240
central nervous system remember it goes
 

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.300
central nervous system remember it goes
from your intestine to the blood into

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:05.310
from your intestine to the blood into
 

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:08.750
from your intestine to the blood into
the cns and this bottom graph is virus

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760
the cns and this bottom graph is virus
 

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.710
the cns and this bottom graph is virus
in the cns and then at some point you

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:12.720
in the cns and then at some point you
 

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.530
in the cns and then at some point you
start to develop stiffness and pain and

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:15.540
start to develop stiffness and pain and
 

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:17.600
start to develop stiffness and pain and
paralysis and that is the typical

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:17.610
paralysis and that is the typical
 

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:20.090
paralysis and that is the typical
poliomyelitis you can have paralysis of

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:20.100
poliomyelitis you can have paralysis of
 

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.590
poliomyelitis you can have paralysis of
the leg muscles as I've said you can

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600
the leg muscles as I've said you can
 

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.080
the leg muscles as I've said you can
also have respiratory muscles which is a

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:24.090
also have respiratory muscles which is a
 

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:27.110
also have respiratory muscles which is a
more severe problem and also paralysis

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:27.120
more severe problem and also paralysis
 

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.390
more severe problem and also paralysis
of nerves that innervate your heart as

00:29:29.390 --> 00:29:29.400
of nerves that innervate your heart as
 

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.000
of nerves that innervate your heart as
well and that could be failed so it's a

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:32.010
well and that could be failed so it's a
 

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:34.040
well and that could be failed so it's a
very rare invasion of the CNS and that's

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:34.050
very rare invasion of the CNS and that's
 

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:36.440
very rare invasion of the CNS and that's
why that original individual medan in

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:36.450
why that original individual medan in
 

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:38.030
why that original individual medan in
the 1800's said he thought that the

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:38.040
the 1800's said he thought that the
 

00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.370
the 1800's said he thought that the
paralysis was a complication because it

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:40.380
paralysis was a complication because it
 

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:45.050
paralysis was a complication because it
wasn't very common now in our lab and

00:29:45.050 --> 00:29:45.060
wasn't very common now in our lab and
 

00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:47.590
wasn't very common now in our lab and
when i started my lab at columbia in

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600
when i started my lab at columbia in
 

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.960
when i started my lab at columbia in
1982 i want to study this disease i had

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:50.970
1982 i want to study this disease i had
 

00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:53.420
1982 i want to study this disease i had
spent three years sequencing polio

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:53.430
spent three years sequencing polio
 

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:55.580
spent three years sequencing polio
and studying it in cell culture but I

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:55.590
and studying it in cell culture but I
 

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:57.380
and studying it in cell culture but I
was really interested in this disease as

00:29:57.380 --> 00:29:57.390
was really interested in this disease as
 

00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:58.940
was really interested in this disease as
you can imagine I had read about it

00:29:58.940 --> 00:29:58.950
you can imagine I had read about it
 

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:01.460
you can imagine I had read about it
actually met Albert Sabin who developed

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:01.470
actually met Albert Sabin who developed
 

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:03.170
actually met Albert Sabin who developed
front of the vaccines I wanted to

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:03.180
front of the vaccines I wanted to
 

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.060
front of the vaccines I wanted to
understand how this disease develop but

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:05.070
understand how this disease develop but
 

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:07.370
understand how this disease develop but
there was no way to do this because the

00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:07.380
there was no way to do this because the
 

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:10.600
there was no way to do this because the
virus only infects people or chimpanzees

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:10.610
virus only infects people or chimpanzees
 

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:13.700
virus only infects people or chimpanzees
and I couldn't afford chimpanzees and I

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:13.710
and I couldn't afford chimpanzees and I
 

00:30:13.710 --> 00:30:14.750
and I couldn't afford chimpanzees and I
didn't really want to work on

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760
didn't really want to work on
 

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.760
didn't really want to work on
chimpanzees anyway so I said who we get

00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:16.770
chimpanzees anyway so I said who we get
 

00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:21.020
chimpanzees anyway so I said who we get
a mouse to be a model for polio so I

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:21.030
a mouse to be a model for polio so I
 

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:23.060
a mouse to be a model for polio so I
told you earlier one of my first

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:23.070
told you earlier one of my first
 

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:24.740
told you earlier one of my first
students had identified the cell

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:24.750
students had identified the cell
 

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:27.440
students had identified the cell
receptor for polio so this is a protein

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:27.450
receptor for polio so this is a protein
 

00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:29.930
receptor for polio so this is a protein
on the surface of cells to which polio

00:30:29.930 --> 00:30:29.940
on the surface of cells to which polio
 

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:33.050
on the surface of cells to which polio
attaches and that lets the virus get in

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:33.060
attaches and that lets the virus get in
 

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:35.720
attaches and that lets the virus get in
and we had found that if we took this

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:35.730
and we had found that if we took this
 

00:30:35.730 --> 00:30:38.960
and we had found that if we took this
receptor and put it on mouse cells that

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:38.970
receptor and put it on mouse cells that
 

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:40.610
receptor and put it on mouse cells that
we were growing in a culture dish now

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:40.620
we were growing in a culture dish now
 

00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:42.470
we were growing in a culture dish now
these mouse cells if you put polio on

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480
these mouse cells if you put polio on
 

00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:44.270
these mouse cells if you put polio on
them nothing happens the virus doesn't

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:44.280
them nothing happens the virus doesn't
 

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.180
them nothing happens the virus doesn't
get in but we found if we put this human

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:47.190
get in but we found if we put this human
 

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:49.550
get in but we found if we put this human
receptor into those mouse cells the

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:49.560
receptor into those mouse cells the
 

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.560
receptor into those mouse cells the
virus would then get in and replicate

00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:51.570
virus would then get in and replicate
 

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:54.200
virus would then get in and replicate
and kill the mouse cells so I was very

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:54.210
and kill the mouse cells so I was very
 

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:56.270
and kill the mouse cells so I was very
young and naive and I said let's do this

00:30:56.270 --> 00:30:56.280
young and naive and I said let's do this
 

00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.090
young and naive and I said let's do this
in a mouse afterwards years later people

00:30:59.090 --> 00:30:59.100
in a mouse afterwards years later people
 

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:00.740
in a mouse afterwards years later people
told me that was a really bold

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:00.750
told me that was a really bold
 

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:03.590
told me that was a really bold
experiment but at the time I just

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600
experiment but at the time I just
 

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:04.670
experiment but at the time I just
thought it would be interesting to try

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:04.680
thought it would be interesting to try
 

00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.650
thought it would be interesting to try
so we made what was called a transgenic

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:06.660
so we made what was called a transgenic
 

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.990
so we made what was called a transgenic
mouse we took the gene encoding this

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000
mouse we took the gene encoding this
 

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.980
mouse we took the gene encoding this
receptor we put it into the chromosomes

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:12.990
receptor we put it into the chromosomes
 

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.020
receptor we put it into the chromosomes
of mice so that all the mice born

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:15.030
of mice so that all the mice born
 

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:16.850
of mice so that all the mice born
subsequently would have this gene and

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:16.860
subsequently would have this gene and
 

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:18.470
subsequently would have this gene and
then we infect then with polio and you

00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480
then we infect then with polio and you
 

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.900
then we infect then with polio and you
can see they develop paralysis this

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:20.910
can see they develop paralysis this
 

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:24.490
can see they develop paralysis this
mouse here as a paralyzed left hind limb

immune cells coming into the spinal cord
 

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:56.450
immune cells coming into the spinal cord
to try and get rid of the infection so

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:56.460
to try and get rid of the infection so
 

00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.970
to try and get rid of the infection so
this spinal cord is infected and we can

00:31:58.970 --> 00:31:58.980
this spinal cord is infected and we can
 

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:00.620
this spinal cord is infected and we can
tell that it's infected not only by the

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:00.630
tell that it's infected not only by the
 

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.240
tell that it's infected not only by the
presence of these immune cells which you

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:02.250
presence of these immune cells which you
 

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:04.370
presence of these immune cells which you
would never see in an uninfected mouse

00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:04.380
would never see in an uninfected mouse
 

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.910
would never see in an uninfected mouse
but also from these green dots here and

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:07.920
but also from these green dots here and
 

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:08.930
but also from these green dots here and
what we have done here is we have

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:08.940
what we have done here is we have
 

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:11.930
what we have done here is we have
stained this section with a probe that

00:32:11.930 --> 00:32:11.940
stained this section with a probe that
 

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.930
stained this section with a probe that
will detect viral RNA so all these green

00:32:14.930 --> 00:32:14.940
will detect viral RNA so all these green
 

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:18.140
will detect viral RNA so all these green
dots are polio virus RNA multiplying in

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:18.150

these cells these happen to be neurons
we can tell because they're very large

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:22.230
we can tell because they're very large
 

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:25.580
we can tell because they're very large
and they are pyramidal in shape and that

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:25.590
and they are pyramidal in shape and that
 

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:27.230
and they are pyramidal in shape and that
is where polio virus is replicating are

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240
is where polio virus is replicating are
 

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.180
is where polio virus is replicating are
many other cell types in the spinal cord

00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:29.190
many other cell types in the spinal cord
 

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:31.220
many other cell types in the spinal cord
but polio doesn't replicate in them only

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:31.230
but polio doesn't replicate in them only
 

00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:33.710
but polio doesn't replicate in them only
the neurons and only the motor neurons

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:33.720
the neurons and only the motor neurons
 

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.070
the neurons and only the motor neurons
and that's why you get paralysis so in

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:37.080
and that's why you get paralysis so in
 

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.320
and that's why you get paralysis so in
this mouse model you can inject the

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:39.330
this mouse model you can inject the
 

00:32:39.330 --> 00:32:41.390
this mouse model you can inject the
virus say into the tail vein or

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:41.400
virus say into the tail vein or
 

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.730
virus say into the tail vein or
intraperitoneally it will make its way

00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:43.740
intraperitoneally it will make its way
 

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.320
intraperitoneally it will make its way
to the spinal cord it will destroy

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:45.330
to the spinal cord it will destroy
 

00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.720
to the spinal cord it will destroy
neurons and that's why the mouse is

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:46.730
neurons and that's why the mouse is
 

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:49.880
neurons and that's why the mouse is
hyndland was paralyzed so we could use

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:49.890
hyndland was paralyzed so we could use
 

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:51.650
hyndland was paralyzed so we could use
this model to study all sorts of

disease how it traveled in the mouse and
 

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:58.880
disease how it traveled in the mouse and
we also use it to study Albert Saban's

00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:58.890
we also use it to study Albert Saban's
 

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:00.890
we also use it to study Albert Saban's
polio vaccines which we'll get to in a

working on them any longer it's an
 

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:25.220
working on them any longer it's an
expense to keep mice so they're now gone

longer around okay let's get back to
 

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:37.850
longer around okay let's get back to
polio history and now move to larger and

have to multiply this times a hundred to

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600
have to multiply this times a hundred to
 

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:57.770
have to multiply this times a hundred to
find the total people infected because

00:33:57.770 --> 00:33:57.780
find the total people infected because
 

00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.960
find the total people infected because
only one in 100 or 200 people are

virus that have some cold like disease
but they're not paralyzed and that's why

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:09.630
but they're not paralyzed and that's why
 

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:12.590
but they're not paralyzed and that's why
the again why the infection spreads so

00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:12.600
the again why the infection spreads so
 

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:13.669

in this epidemic is this the practice of

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:16.649
in this epidemic is this the practice of
 

00:34:16.649 --> 00:34:19.250
in this epidemic is this the practice of
quarantine II was used this was

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260
quarantine II was used this was
 

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.599
quarantine II was used this was
something that was developed in the

00:34:20.599 --> 00:34:20.609
something that was developed in the
 

00:34:20.609 --> 00:34:22.669
something that was developed in the
preceding years and they said well if

00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679
preceding years and they said well if
 

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:23.930
preceding years and they said well if
you have someone who's paralyzed we're

00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:23.940
you have someone who's paralyzed we're
 

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.399
you have someone who's paralyzed we're
going to put them in quarantine so they

00:34:25.399 --> 00:34:25.409
going to put them in quarantine so they
 

00:34:25.409 --> 00:34:28.490
going to put them in quarantine so they
can't infect anyone else in at this time

00:34:28.490 --> 00:34:28.500
can't infect anyone else in at this time
 

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.399
can't infect anyone else in at this time
that was realized to be futile because

00:34:31.399 --> 00:34:31.409
that was realized to be futile because
 

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:33.950
that was realized to be futile because
during this epidemic we learned that in

00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960
during this epidemic we learned that in
 

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.780
during this epidemic we learned that in
fact most people who are infected with

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:35.790
fact most people who are infected with
 

00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:37.549
fact most people who are infected with
the virus don't show paralysis so

00:34:37.549 --> 00:34:37.559
the virus don't show paralysis so
 

00:34:37.559 --> 00:34:39.680
the virus don't show paralysis so
there's no point in quarantine the

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:39.690
there's no point in quarantine the
 

00:34:39.690 --> 00:34:41.540
there's no point in quarantine the
paralyzed individuals because there are

00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:41.550
paralyzed individuals because there are
 

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:43.940
paralyzed individuals because there are
for everyone there are 99 walking around

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:43.950
for everyone there are 99 walking around
 

00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:47.450
for everyone there are 99 walking around
who are actually shedding the virus this

00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:47.460
who are actually shedding the virus this
 

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.339
who are actually shedding the virus this
is a problem with many virus infections

00:34:49.339 --> 00:34:49.349
is a problem with many virus infections
 

00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:52.190
is a problem with many virus infections
not all a smallpox for example every

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200
not all a smallpox for example every
 

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:55.220
not all a smallpox for example every
infected case shows symptoms and that's

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:55.230
infected case shows symptoms and that's
 

00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:56.750
infected case shows symptoms and that's
one of the reasons why you could

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:56.760
one of the reasons why you could
 

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:59.000
one of the reasons why you could
eradicate it the way they did which was

00:34:59.000 --> 00:34:59.010
eradicate it the way they did which was
 

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:00.859
eradicate it the way they did which was
to find a case and then do ring

00:35:00.859 --> 00:35:00.869
to find a case and then do ring
 

00:35:00.869 --> 00:35:03.260
to find a case and then do ring
immunization in that area but you can't

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:03.270
immunization in that area but you can't
 

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.089
immunization in that area but you can't
do that with polio because you can't see

00:35:05.089 --> 00:35:05.099
do that with polio because you can't see
 

00:35:05.099 --> 00:35:07.130
do that with polio because you can't see
everyone who is infected and that will

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:07.140
everyone who is infected and that will
 

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.319
everyone who is infected and that will
return later as an issue in polio

00:35:09.319 --> 00:35:09.329
return later as an issue in polio
 

00:35:09.329 --> 00:35:11.930
return later as an issue in polio
eradication so from this epidemic we had

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:11.940
eradication so from this epidemic we had
 

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.120
eradication so from this epidemic we had
four conclusions first of all it's

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:14.130
four conclusions first of all it's
 

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:16.190
four conclusions first of all it's
exclusively a human infection there was

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200
exclusively a human infection there was
 

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.530

no evidence for any other animal being
 

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:21.819
no evidence for any other animal being
involved it's far more prevalent than

cases per total infected and these

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:31.140
cases per total infected and these
 

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.349
cases per total infected and these
asymptomatic in mild cases so

00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359
asymptomatic in mild cases so
 

00:35:33.359 --> 00:35:35.270
asymptomatic in mild cases so
asymptomatic no symptoms or the mild

cough etc those are the most important

00:35:41.359 --> 00:35:41.369
cough etc those are the most important
 

00:35:41.369 --> 00:35:44.089

consequence if you have an epidemic

00:35:46.819 --> 00:35:46.829
consequence if you have an epidemic
 

00:35:46.829 --> 00:35:48.859
consequence if you have an epidemic
where you have one or one two three

00:35:48.859 --> 00:35:48.869
where you have one or one two three
 

00:35:48.869 --> 00:35:52.099
where you have one or one two three
cases per a thousand people this will

00:35:52.099 --> 00:35:52.109
cases per a thousand people this will
 

00:35:52.109 --> 00:35:54.020
cases per a thousand people this will
immunize the general population that's

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:54.030
immunize the general population that's
 

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:56.720
immunize the general population that's
why epidemics are self-limiting because

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:56.730
why epidemics are self-limiting because
 

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:58.010
why epidemics are self-limiting because
you have enough infection without

00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:58.020
you have enough infection without
 

00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.380
you have enough infection without
disease that the virus is spreading to

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:00.390
disease that the virus is spreading to
 

00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:02.359
disease that the virus is spreading to
everyone and it basically immunizes

00:36:02.359 --> 00:36:02.369
everyone and it basically immunizes
 

00:36:02.369 --> 00:36:05.150
everyone and it basically immunizes
everyone so every polio epidemic is

00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:05.160
everyone so every polio epidemic is
 

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.400
everyone so every polio epidemic is
self-limiting and it will only occur

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:07.410
self-limiting and it will only occur
 

00:36:07.410 --> 00:36:09.049
self-limiting and it will only occur
again when you have enough susceptibles

00:36:09.049 --> 00:36:09.059
again when you have enough susceptibles
 

00:36:09.059 --> 00:36:10.430
again when you have enough susceptibles
in the population so these are very

00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440
in the population so these are very
 

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.339
in the population so these are very
important lessons learned now many of

paralytic disease of course wouldn't
 

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.580
paralytic disease of course wouldn't
happen today but back then there was no

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:10.590
happen today but back then there was no
 

00:37:10.590 --> 00:37:13.670
happen today but back then there was no
internet not much television and so it

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680
internet not much television and so it
 

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.510
internet not much television and so it
was possible he of course wanted to find

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520
was possible he of course wanted to find
 

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.790
was possible he of course wanted to find
a solution to the disease so he started

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800
a solution to the disease so he started
 

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:21.680
a solution to the disease so he started
the March of Dimes which raised money

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:21.690
the March of Dimes which raised money
 

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.320
the March of Dimes which raised money
and eventually that money was used to

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:24.330
and eventually that money was used to
 

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:27.350
and eventually that money was used to
develop polio vaccines and along the way

00:37:27.350 --> 00:37:27.360
develop polio vaccines and along the way
 

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:29.450
develop polio vaccines and along the way
it took many years to make a polio

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:29.460
it took many years to make a polio
 

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.370
it took many years to make a polio
vaccine this is a good lesson actually

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:31.380
vaccine this is a good lesson actually
 

00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.070
vaccine this is a good lesson actually
so the virus was isolated in 1908 and

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:34.080
so the virus was isolated in 1908 and
 

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:37.070
so the virus was isolated in 1908 and
the first vaccine that worked was

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:37.080
the first vaccine that worked was
 

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:41.450
the first vaccine that worked was
released in 1954 to 50 years to make a

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:41.460
released in 1954 to 50 years to make a
 

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.940
released in 1954 to 50 years to make a
vaccine because we had to learn a lot of

00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:43.950
vaccine because we had to learn a lot of
 

00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:46.730
vaccine because we had to learn a lot of
things before we could make a good

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:46.740
things before we could make a good
 

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:48.200
things before we could make a good
vaccine not that people didn't try

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:48.210
vaccine not that people didn't try
 

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.000
vaccine not that people didn't try
people did try to make vaccines but they

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:50.010
people did try to make vaccines but they
 

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:51.680
people did try to make vaccines but they
didn't work so here are some of the

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:51.690
didn't work so here are some of the
 

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:55.340
didn't work so here are some of the
milestones in leading to a vaccine 1931

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:55.350
milestones in leading to a vaccine 1931
 

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:58.340
milestones in leading to a vaccine 1931

paralyzed at the throat and people again
realizing that this could be spread from

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:07.080
realizing that this could be spread from
 

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.770
realizing that this could be spread from
people who didn't have paralytic disease

else the virus entered the nose and
 

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:28.130
else the virus entered the nose and
entered your brain through the nose and

we place the monkey from detecting and

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640
we place the monkey from detecting and
 

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:07.210
we place the monkey from detecting and
propagating polio and this allowed us to

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:07.220
propagating polio and this allowed us to
 

00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:09.580
propagating polio and this allowed us to
grow a vaccine you can't grow vaccines

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:09.590
grow a vaccine you can't grow vaccines
 

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:11.410
grow a vaccine you can't grow vaccines
and animals so we needed a cell culture

00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:11.420
and animals so we needed a cell culture
 

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.870
and animals so we needed a cell culture
and this was the key discovery they got

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:13.880

we can make a vaccine we can if we can

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:30.740
we can make a vaccine we can if we can
 

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:32.830
we can make a vaccine we can if we can
make antibodies then we can protect

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:32.840
make antibodies then we can protect
 

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:36.430

just a few years before the vaccine was

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:39.320
just a few years before the vaccine was
 

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.530
just a few years before the vaccine was
released we learned that there are three

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:41.540
released we learned that there are three
 

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:44.170
released we learned that there are three
serotypes of polio now a Sarah type

00:39:44.170 --> 00:39:44.180
serotypes of polio now a Sarah type
 

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:45.910
serotypes of polio now a Sarah type
means that if you make an antibody

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920
means that if you make an antibody
 

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.640
means that if you make an antibody
against one Sarah type those antibodies

00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:48.650
against one Sarah type those antibodies
 

00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:50.890
against one Sarah type those antibodies
will protect you against that but not of

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:50.900
will protect you against that but not of
 

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:52.660
will protect you against that but not of
two other any other serotypes that may

two other any other serotypes that may
 

00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:55.240
two other any other serotypes that may
exist so if people didn't know this

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:55.250
exist so if people didn't know this
 

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:56.890
exist so if people didn't know this
earlier that there were three serotypes

00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:56.900
earlier that there were three serotypes
 

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.840
earlier that there were three serotypes
of polio and they would make a vaccine

00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:58.850
of polio and they would make a vaccine
 

00:39:58.850 --> 00:40:01.120
of polio and they would make a vaccine
against one Sarah type and then the

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:01.130
against one Sarah type and then the
 

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:02.650
against one Sarah type and then the
other two serotypes would come in in

00:40:02.650 --> 00:40:02.660
other two serotypes would come in in
 

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:05.050
other two serotypes would come in in
quaaz polio so this was a very important

observations and he developed what we
 

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:45.790
observations and he developed what we
now call the oral polio vaccine or opv

the beginning you would give type 1

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:45.830
the beginning you would give type 1
 

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:47.920
the beginning you would give type 1
first then type 2 and then type 3 so you

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:47.930
first then type 2 and then type 3 so you
 

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:49.720
first then type 2 and then type 3 so you
had to have the kids come back three

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:49.730
had to have the kids come back three
 

00:44:49.730 --> 00:44:51.310
had to have the kids come back three
times which is very difficult you're

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:51.320
times which is very difficult you're
 

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.160

into routine vaccination program for
 

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:03.100
into routine vaccination program for
young children so now you have to be

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:03.110
young children so now you have to be
 

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:06.390
young children so now you have to be
immunized in order to go to school and

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400
immunized in order to go to school and
 

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:10.960

in the US so those are the two vaccines

00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:18.900
in the US so those are the two vaccines
 

00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:20.330
in the US so those are the two vaccines
that were made we still have both of

00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:20.340
that were made we still have both of
 

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:22.850
that were made we still have both of
them you can use either one in depending

00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:22.860
them you can use either one in depending
 

00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:24.830
them you can use either one in depending
on the country that you're in we have

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:24.840
on the country that you're in we have
 

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.290

inactivated vaccine this is an injected
 

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.630
inactivated vaccine this is an injected
vaccine by the way so you need a trained

vaccine by the way so you need a trained
 

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:33.080
vaccine by the way so you need a trained
health care person to do it if you make

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:33.090
health care person to do it if you make
 

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:35.900
health care person to do it if you make
it right it doesn't give you polio since

00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:35.910
it right it doesn't give you polio since
 

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:37.970
it right it doesn't give you polio since
the nineteen fifty incident it's been

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:37.980
the nineteen fifty incident it's been
 

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:40.340
the nineteen fifty incident it's been
fine it doesn't give you immunity in

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:40.350
fine it doesn't give you immunity in
 

00:45:40.350 --> 00:45:42.050
fine it doesn't give you immunity in
your intestine it's injected into your

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:42.060
your intestine it's injected into your
 

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.000
your intestine it's injected into your
arm gives you antibodies in your blood

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:44.010
arm gives you antibodies in your blood
 

00:45:44.010 --> 00:45:46.250
arm gives you antibodies in your blood
but you could still in jest polio and

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:46.260
but you could still in jest polio and
 

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.440
but you could still in jest polio and
that would replicate in your intestine

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:48.450
that would replicate in your intestine
 

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:51.170
that would replicate in your intestine
it would get into your blood and then it

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:51.180
it would get into your blood and then it
 

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.730
it would get into your blood and then it
would hit those antibodies and be

00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:52.740
would hit those antibodies and be
 

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:54.680
would hit those antibodies and be
neutralized but you could still excrete

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:54.690
neutralized but you could still excrete
 

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:57.680
neutralized but you could still excrete
polio okay the reason I say this is

00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:57.690
polio okay the reason I say this is
 

00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:00.680
polio okay the reason I say this is
because the US now is using only ipv so

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:00.690
because the US now is using only ipv so
 

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:03.440
because the US now is using only ipv so
the collective elementary tracts of

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:03.450
the collective elementary tracts of
 

00:46:03.450 --> 00:46:06.560
the collective elementary tracts of
Americans are susceptible to polio so if

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:06.570
Americans are susceptible to polio so if
 

00:46:06.570 --> 00:46:09.380
Americans are susceptible to polio so if
a strain came into the US it could

00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:09.390
a strain came into the US it could
 

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:12.980
a strain came into the US it could
replicate in our guts and perhaps spread

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:12.990
replicate in our guts and perhaps spread
 

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:16.610
replicate in our guts and perhaps spread
to someone who wasn't immunized so we

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:16.620
to someone who wasn't immunized so we
 

00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:19.160
to someone who wasn't immunized so we
used ipv until nineteen sixty one and

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:19.170
used ipv until nineteen sixty one and
 

00:46:19.170 --> 00:46:20.690
used ipv until nineteen sixty one and
then we started using it again in two

00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:20.700
then we started using it again in two
 

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:23.090
then we started using it again in two
thousand and we'll talk about why opv is

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:23.100
thousand and we'll talk about why opv is
 

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:24.800
thousand and we'll talk about why opv is
very easy to administer you just drink

00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:24.810
very easy to administer you just drink
 

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:27.320
very easy to administer you just drink
it you don't need any doctor or nurse to

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:27.330
it you don't need any doctor or nurse to
 

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:29.270
it you don't need any doctor or nurse to
do that you get intestinal immunity

00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280
do that you get intestinal immunity
 

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:30.920
do that you get intestinal immunity
because it grows it replicates in your

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:30.930
because it grows it replicates in your
 

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:34.340
because it grows it replicates in your
gut and these are made of viruses that

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:34.350
gut and these are made of viruses that
 

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:37.370
gut and these are made of viruses that
albert sabin empirically derived from

00:46:37.370 --> 00:46:37.380
albert sabin empirically derived from
 

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:39.440
albert sabin empirically derived from
wild-type virus will talk about that and

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:39.450
wild-type virus will talk about that and
 

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:41.960
wild-type virus will talk about that and
a very important point it usually

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:41.970
a very important point it usually
 

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:43.670
a very important point it usually
reverts in the intestine as it

00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680
reverts in the intestine as it
 

00:46:43.680 --> 00:46:44.960
reverts in the intestine as it
replicates and we will talk a lot about

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:44.970
replicates and we will talk a lot about
 

00:46:44.970 --> 00:46:47.690
replicates and we will talk a lot about
that and we use this from nineteen sixty

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:47.700
that and we use this from nineteen sixty
 

00:46:47.700 --> 00:46:49.340
that and we use this from nineteen sixty
one to two thousand and two thousand we

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:49.350
one to two thousand and two thousand we
 

00:46:49.350 --> 00:46:53.510
one to two thousand and two thousand we
switched to ipv so how do these vaccines

00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520
switched to ipv so how do these vaccines
 

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.150
switched to ipv so how do these vaccines
work again you ingest polio it goes into

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160
work again you ingest polio it goes into
 

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.470
work again you ingest polio it goes into
your alimentary tract where it

00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480
your alimentary tract where it
 

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:01.100
your alimentary tract where it
replicates opv will block the virus from

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:01.110
replicates opv will block the virus from
 

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:03.290
replicates opv will block the virus from
replicating in the epithelium of your

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:03.300
replicating in the epithelium of your
 

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.660
replicating in the epithelium of your
alimentary tract ipv will not it will

00:47:05.660 --> 00:47:05.670
alimentary tract ipv will not it will
 

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:07.550
alimentary tract ipv will not it will
only block virus once it enters the

00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:07.560
only block virus once it enters the
 

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:10.190
only block virus once it enters the
blood so two very different vaccines and

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200
blood so two very different vaccines and
 

00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.150
blood so two very different vaccines and
this is the effect on polio in the US

00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:13.160
this is the effect on polio in the US
 

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:16.180
this is the effect on polio in the US
here at the number of cases annually

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:16.190
here at the number of cases annually
 

00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:19.090
here at the number of cases annually
twenty to thirty thousand in the US

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:19.100
twenty to thirty thousand in the US
 

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:21.290
twenty to thirty thousand in the US
introduction of the inactivated vaccine

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:21.300
introduction of the inactivated vaccine
 

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.750
introduction of the inactivated vaccine
caused the precipitous decline in a

00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760
caused the precipitous decline in a
 

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.360
caused the precipitous decline in a
number of cases and then we brought in

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:26.370
number of cases and then we brought in
 

00:47:26.370 --> 00:47:29.460
number of cases and then we brought in
the Sabin vaccine in 1961

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:29.470
the Sabin vaccine in 1961
 

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:32.370
the Sabin vaccine in 1961
case in 1979 we have no more for the

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:32.380
case in 1979 we have no more for the
 

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:34.290
case in 1979 we have no more for the
most part no polio in the US with a few

00:47:34.290 --> 00:47:34.300
most part no polio in the US with a few
 

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:37.920
most part no polio in the US with a few
exceptions nevertheless even though we

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:37.930
exceptions nevertheless even though we
 

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:40.170
exceptions nevertheless even though we
had two really good polio vaccines and

00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:40.180
had two really good polio vaccines and
 

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:42.630
had two really good polio vaccines and
in developing countries most of the kids

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.640
in developing countries most of the kids
 

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.960
in developing countries most of the kids
didn't get them for a variety of reasons

00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:44.970
didn't get them for a variety of reasons
 

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:47.970
didn't get them for a variety of reasons
and so there was still a lot of global

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:47.980
and so there was still a lot of global
 

00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:52.170
and so there was still a lot of global
polio even by the 1980s when we had

00:47:52.170 --> 00:47:52.180
polio even by the 1980s when we had
 

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:54.630
polio even by the 1980s when we had
eradicated it from the US now Sabin went

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640
eradicated it from the US now Sabin went
 

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.870
eradicated it from the US now Sabin went
to Brazil at this time and he instituted

00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:57.880
to Brazil at this time and he instituted
 

00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.880
to Brazil at this time and he instituted
mass immunization campaigns which he

00:47:59.880 --> 00:47:59.890
mass immunization campaigns which he
 

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:02.700
mass immunization campaigns which he
called national immunization days and he

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:02.710
called national immunization days and he
 

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:04.530
called national immunization days and he
showed that you could eradicate polio in

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:04.540
showed that you could eradicate polio in
 

00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:06.630
showed that you could eradicate polio in
a country like Brazil by just two

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640
a country like Brazil by just two
 

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:09.330
a country like Brazil by just two
immunizations and as a result of his

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:09.340
immunizations and as a result of his
 

00:48:09.340 --> 00:48:13.109
immunizations and as a result of his
work in Brazil the wh 0 established this

00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119
work in Brazil the wh 0 established this
 

00:48:13.119 --> 00:48:15.660
work in Brazil the wh 0 established this
expanded program on immunization and

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:15.670
expanded program on immunization and
 

00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:17.550
expanded program on immunization and
they said we're going to help increase

00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:17.560
they said we're going to help increase
 

00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:19.410
they said we're going to help increase
the use and distribution of polio

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:19.420
the use and distribution of polio
 

00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:21.480
the use and distribution of polio
vaccine worldwide and it's really

00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:21.490
vaccine worldwide and it's really
 

00:48:21.490 --> 00:48:23.550
vaccine worldwide and it's really
because of Sabin and wh 0 taking this

00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:23.560
because of Sabin and wh 0 taking this
 

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:25.410
because of Sabin and wh 0 taking this
initiative that we're at the point where

00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:25.420
initiative that we're at the point where
 

00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:27.960
initiative that we're at the point where
we are today so here is the data from

00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:27.970
we are today so here is the data from
 

00:48:27.970 --> 00:48:31.230
we are today so here is the data from
Brazil these are the incidents of polio

00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:31.240
Brazil these are the incidents of polio
 

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.300
Brazil these are the incidents of polio
cases in Brazil before immunization

00:48:33.300 --> 00:48:33.310
cases in Brazil before immunization
 

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:34.859
cases in Brazil before immunization
these are the number of cases here and

00:48:34.859 --> 00:48:34.869
these are the number of cases here and
 

00:48:34.869 --> 00:48:37.109
these are the number of cases here and
you can see he did twice a year june in

00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:37.119
you can see he did twice a year june in
 

00:48:37.119 --> 00:48:39.540
you can see he did twice a year june in
august every year and eventually got rid

00:48:39.540 --> 00:48:39.550
august every year and eventually got rid
 

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:43.050
august every year and eventually got rid
of polio in brazil very important so the

00:48:43.050 --> 00:48:43.060
of polio in brazil very important so the
 

00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.420
of polio in brazil very important so the
wh 0 eventually decided that they could

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:45.430
wh 0 eventually decided that they could
 

00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:47.760
wh 0 eventually decided that they could
eradicate polio and i think you've heard

00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:47.770
eradicate polio and i think you've heard
 

00:48:47.770 --> 00:48:50.760
eradicate polio and i think you've heard
about this in this series before they

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:50.770
about this in this series before they
 

00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:54.240
about this in this series before they
made a resolution in 1988 and the idea

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:54.250
made a resolution in 1988 and the idea
 

00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:57.630
made a resolution in 1988 and the idea
would be eradication would occur by 2005

00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:57.640
would be eradication would occur by 2005
 

00:48:57.640 --> 00:48:59.940
would be eradication would occur by 2005
and then at some point we would stop

00:48:59.940 --> 00:48:59.950
and then at some point we would stop
 

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:01.770
and then at some point we would stop
immunizing because you don't want to

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:01.780
immunizing because you don't want to
 

00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:03.120
immunizing because you don't want to
keep immunizing for a disease that

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:03.130
keep immunizing for a disease that
 

00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:05.970
keep immunizing for a disease that
doesn't exist so here we are in 2012 and

00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:05.980
doesn't exist so here we are in 2012 and
 

00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:08.310
doesn't exist so here we are in 2012 and
we still have polio so let's look at why

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:08.320
we still have polio so let's look at why
 

00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.680
we still have polio so let's look at why
and how that relates to the biology of

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:10.690
and how that relates to the biology of
 

00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:13.050
and how that relates to the biology of
the virus so here's the incidence

00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:13.060
the virus so here's the incidence
 

00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:16.740
the virus so here's the incidence
globally of polio 1988 600,000 reported

00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:16.750
globally of polio 1988 600,000 reported
 

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:18.420
globally of polio 1988 600,000 reported
cases globally probably vastly

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:18.430
cases globally probably vastly
 

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:22.620
cases globally probably vastly
underreported much lower in 1988 1998

00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:22.630
underreported much lower in 1988 1998
 

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:25.349
underreported much lower in 1988 1998
and in 2008 and I'll show you the

00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359
and in 2008 and I'll show you the
 

00:49:25.359 --> 00:49:28.920
and in 2008 and I'll show you the
statistics today less than a thousand

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:28.930
statistics today less than a thousand
 

00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:31.829
statistics today less than a thousand
cases per year so here are the

00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839
cases per year so here are the
 

00:49:31.839 --> 00:49:34.200
cases per year so here are the
challenges to eradicating this virus now

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:34.210
challenges to eradicating this virus now
 

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:36.810
challenges to eradicating this virus now
we still have transmission of wild

00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:36.820
we still have transmission of wild
 

00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.880
we still have transmission of wild
viruses that is that are out there in

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:38.890
viruses that is that are out there in
 

00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:41.490
viruses that is that are out there in
certain places we have at a complication

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:41.500
certain places we have at a complication
 

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:43.010
certain places we have at a complication
that we didn't predict

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:43.020
that we didn't predict
 

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:45.750
that we didn't predict
they're called vaccine derived polio

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760
they're called vaccine derived polio
 

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.670
they're called vaccine derived polio
viruses will talk about that we have

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:47.680
viruses will talk about that we have
 

00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.250
viruses will talk about that we have
persistence of vaccine virus in people

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:50.260
persistence of vaccine virus in people
 

00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:52.740
persistence of vaccine virus in people
without antibodies and then we have

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:52.750
without antibodies and then we have
 

00:49:52.750 --> 00:49:54.690
without antibodies and then we have
reinfection of previously polio-free

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:54.700
reinfection of previously polio-free
 

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:56.760
reinfection of previously polio-free
areas so we're going to touch on some of

00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:56.770
areas so we're going to touch on some of
 

00:49:56.770 --> 00:49:59.430
areas so we're going to touch on some of
those in the next few minutes so how did

00:49:59.430 --> 00:49:59.440
those in the next few minutes so how did
 

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:01.680
those in the next few minutes so how did
save and make his vaccines important for

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:01.690
save and make his vaccines important for
 

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:03.840
save and make his vaccines important for

passed it extensively in monkey so

00:50:16.380 --> 00:50:16.390
passed it extensively in monkey so
 

00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:18.600
passed it extensively in monkey so
passage means you infect the monkey the

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:18.610
passage means you infect the monkey the
 

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:20.460

monkey gets paralyzed you grind up the

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:20.470
monkey gets paralyzed you grind up the
 

00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:22.650
monkey gets paralyzed you grind up the
spinal cord you make an extract you pass

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:22.660
spinal cord you make an extract you pass
 

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:25.590

then he passed it in monkey testicle

00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:28.120
then he passed it in monkey testicle
 

00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.530
then he passed it in monkey testicle
cultures monkey kidney cultures 39 3 so

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:31.540

right in the spinal cord so it's an

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:41.170
right in the spinal cord so it's an
 

00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:44.250

he tested him on himself that's the way

00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000
he tested him on himself that's the way
 

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.490
he tested him on himself that's the way
it was done those things then he gave it

00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:17.500
it was done those things then he gave it
 

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:21.920
it was done those things then he gave it
who did he give it to next prisoners

00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:21.930
who did he give it to next prisoners
 

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:25.320
who did he give it to next prisoners
volunteer prisoners and then he moved

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:25.330
volunteer prisoners and then he moved
 

00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:26.730
volunteer prisoners and then he moved
into larger clinical trials and

00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:26.740
into larger clinical trials and
 

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.440
into larger clinical trials and
eventually the Soviet Union a hundred

00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:28.450
eventually the Soviet Union a hundred
 

00:51:28.450 --> 00:51:30.780
eventually the Soviet Union a hundred
million kids and that's how it got

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:30.790
million kids and that's how it got
 

00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:32.370
million kids and that's how it got
license but today of course you don't do

00:51:32.370 --> 00:51:32.380
license but today of course you don't do
 

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:35.010

that so when I started working on polio

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:35.020
that so when I started working on polio
 

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:37.980
that so when I started working on polio
we had the ability to sequence the

00:51:37.980 --> 00:51:37.990
we had the ability to sequence the
 

00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:40.650
we had the ability to sequence the
genome first time in the nineteen eighty

00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:40.660
genome first time in the nineteen eighty
 

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:43.140
genome first time in the nineteen eighty
so we could say let's take what Albert

00:51:43.140 --> 00:51:43.150
so we could say let's take what Albert
 

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:45.750
so we could say let's take what Albert
Sabin made and sequence it and compare

00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:45.760
Sabin made and sequence it and compare
 

00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:48.030
Sabin made and sequence it and compare
it to what he started with and see what

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:48.040
it to what he started with and see what
 

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:50.670
it to what he started with and see what
are the changes so he did that there

00:51:50.670 --> 00:51:50.680
are the changes so he did that there
 

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:53.610
are the changes so he did that there
were many many changes from the virulent

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:53.620
were many many changes from the virulent
 

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:55.860
were many many changes from the virulent
to the attenuated virus that is the

00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:55.870
to the attenuated virus that is the
 

00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:56.339
to the attenuated virus that is the
vaccine

00:51:56.339 --> 00:51:56.349

virus but then we took my mouse model

00:51:59.700 --> 00:51:59.710
virus but then we took my mouse model
 

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:02.460
virus but then we took my mouse model
for polio and we put the changes in one

00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:02.470
for polio and we put the changes in one
 

00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:04.710
for polio and we put the changes in one
by one into the virulent virus and said

00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720
by one into the virulent virus and said
 

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:06.299
by one into the virulent virus and said
which one of these make it a good

00:52:06.299 --> 00:52:06.309
which one of these make it a good
 

00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:08.640
which one of these make it a good
vaccine we did that for many years and

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:08.650
vaccine we did that for many years and
 

00:52:08.650 --> 00:52:10.710
vaccine we did that for many years and
other people did it in monkeys and this

00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720
other people did it in monkeys and this
 

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:12.359
other people did it in monkeys and this
is the result of that for all three

00:52:12.359 --> 00:52:12.369
is the result of that for all three
 

00:52:12.369 --> 00:52:15.660
is the result of that for all three
serotypes these are the mutations in the

00:52:15.660 --> 00:52:15.670
serotypes these are the mutations in the
 

00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:17.819
serotypes these are the mutations in the
genome that Albert Sabin selected for

00:52:17.819 --> 00:52:17.829
genome that Albert Sabin selected for
 

00:52:17.829 --> 00:52:19.710
genome that Albert Sabin selected for
which are very important for making

00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:19.720
which are very important for making
 

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:21.329
which are very important for making
these good vaccine strains so these

00:52:21.329 --> 00:52:21.339
these good vaccine strains so these
 

00:52:21.339 --> 00:52:23.519
these good vaccine strains so these
don't mean a lot to you you can see the

00:52:23.519 --> 00:52:23.529
don't mean a lot to you you can see the
 

00:52:23.529 --> 00:52:26.249
don't mean a lot to you you can see the
type one has five changes and then the

00:52:26.249 --> 00:52:26.259
type one has five changes and then the
 

00:52:26.259 --> 00:52:29.069
type one has five changes and then the
type 2 and 3 have two changes that make

00:52:29.069 --> 00:52:29.079
type 2 and 3 have two changes that make
 

00:52:29.079 --> 00:52:31.950
type 2 and 3 have two changes that make
it a good vaccine just two so we didn't

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:31.960
it a good vaccine just two so we didn't
 

00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:34.019
it a good vaccine just two so we didn't
know this when Saban's vaccines were

00:52:34.019 --> 00:52:34.029
know this when Saban's vaccines were
 

00:52:34.029 --> 00:52:36.539
know this when Saban's vaccines were
licensed because if we knew it they

00:52:36.539 --> 00:52:36.549
licensed because if we knew it they
 

00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:38.430
licensed because if we knew it they
would never have been licensed today if

00:52:38.430 --> 00:52:38.440
would never have been licensed today if
 

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:41.099
would never have been licensed today if
you try to license a vaccine a live

00:52:41.099 --> 00:52:41.109
you try to license a vaccine a live
 

00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:43.349
you try to license a vaccine a live
attenuated vaccine with two changes out

00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359
attenuated vaccine with two changes out
 

00:52:43.359 --> 00:52:45.930
attenuated vaccine with two changes out
of 7,500 the FDA would say come back

00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:45.940
of 7,500 the FDA would say come back
 

00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:47.969
of 7,500 the FDA would say come back
when you have that in a hundred or 50 or

00:52:47.969 --> 00:52:47.979
when you have that in a hundred or 50 or
 

00:52:47.979 --> 00:52:49.890
when you have that in a hundred or 50 or
it's more stable but we didn't know that

00:52:49.890 --> 00:52:49.900
it's more stable but we didn't know that
 

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:51.420
it's more stable but we didn't know that
and technology you gave us the ability

00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:51.430
and technology you gave us the ability
 

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:54.809
and technology you gave us the ability
to know this so very few changes make

00:52:54.809 --> 00:52:54.819
to know this so very few changes make
 

00:52:54.819 --> 00:52:57.569
to know this so very few changes make

00:53:38.319 --> 00:53:40.620
the same area this is the change in the
type 1 virus the type to in the type 3

00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:40.630
type 1 virus the type to in the type 3
 

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:42.660
type 1 virus the type to in the type 3
and this is amazing to me because he

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:42.670
and this is amazing to me because he
 

00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:44.789
and this is amazing to me because he
selected these viruses separately in

00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:44.799
selected these viruses separately in
 

00:53:44.799 --> 00:53:46.890
selected these viruses separately in
monkeys but they all end up having a

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:46.900
monkeys but they all end up having a
 

00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:49.319
monkeys but they all end up having a
similar mutation in a very very

00:53:49.319 --> 00:53:49.329
similar mutation in a very very
 

00:53:49.329 --> 00:53:52.079
similar mutation in a very very
neighboring part of the genome all right

00:53:52.079 --> 00:53:52.089
neighboring part of the genome all right
 

00:53:52.089 --> 00:53:53.579
neighboring part of the genome all right
so this is it this is probably the most

00:53:53.579 --> 00:53:53.589
so this is it this is probably the most
 

00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:56.489
so this is it this is probably the most
important mutation in all these strains

00:53:56.489 --> 00:53:56.499
important mutation in all these strains
 

00:53:56.499 --> 00:54:00.569
important mutation in all these strains
that make his virus not virulent when

you drink it that's important to
 

00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:05.130
you drink it that's important to
remember so in my lab we had made these

00:54:05.130 --> 00:54:05.140
remember so in my lab we had made these
 

00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:08.640
remember so in my lab we had made these
mice susceptible to polio so what we did

00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:08.650
mice susceptible to polio so what we did
 

00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:09.900
mice susceptible to polio so what we did
is we infected

00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:09.910
is we infected
 

00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:13.559
is we infected
em with two different polio viruses and

00:54:13.559 --> 00:54:13.569
em with two different polio viruses and
 

00:54:13.569 --> 00:54:16.650
em with two different polio viruses and
one of them has a base at 472 that's in

00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:16.660
one of them has a base at 472 that's in
 

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:19.559
one of them has a base at 472 that's in
that five prime UTR to you that's the

00:54:19.559 --> 00:54:19.569
that five prime UTR to you that's the
 

00:54:19.569 --> 00:54:22.339
that five prime UTR to you that's the
base that was in Saban's polio vaccine

00:54:22.339 --> 00:54:22.349
base that was in Saban's polio vaccine
 

00:54:22.349 --> 00:54:25.920
base that was in Saban's polio vaccine
the other virus has AC at that position

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:25.930
the other virus has AC at that position
 

00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:29.190
the other virus has AC at that position
that is the base and the virus that

00:54:29.190 --> 00:54:29.200
that is the base and the virus that
 

00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:31.559
that is the base and the virus that
saved and started with that's the virial

00:54:31.559 --> 00:54:31.569
saved and started with that's the virial
 

00:54:31.569 --> 00:54:35.099
saved and started with that's the virial
and face if you will if you inject so

00:54:35.099 --> 00:54:35.109
and face if you will if you inject so
 

00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:37.740
and face if you will if you inject so
these two viruses are identical for

00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:37.750
these two viruses are identical for
 

00:54:37.750 --> 00:54:40.680
these two viruses are identical for
7,000 and 440 nucleotides except for

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:40.690
7,000 and 440 nucleotides except for
 

00:54:40.690 --> 00:54:42.240
7,000 and 440 nucleotides except for
this one based difference if you put

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:42.250
this one based difference if you put
 

00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:45.150
this one based difference if you put
them in mice this one doesn't do

00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:45.160
them in mice this one doesn't do
 

00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:46.950
them in mice this one doesn't do
anything to the mice you can put as much

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:46.960
anything to the mice you can put as much
 

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:48.599

none get paralyzed they're fine if you

00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:51.490
none get paralyzed they're fine if you
 

00:54:51.490 --> 00:54:54.420
none get paralyzed they're fine if you
put in the sea if you put 9,000

infectious viruses into them half the
mice get paralyzed so this is quite

00:54:58.710 --> 00:54:58.720
mice get paralyzed so this is quite
 

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:01.680
mice get paralyzed so this is quite
lethal and just changing one base makes

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:01.690
lethal and just changing one base makes
 

00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:02.910
lethal and just changing one base makes
a big difference so this is an

00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:02.920
a big difference so this is an
 

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.650
a big difference so this is an
incredibly important base and this is

00:55:04.650 --> 00:55:04.660
incredibly important base and this is
 

00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:06.150
incredibly important base and this is
why when we drink the Sabin vaccine

00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160
why when we drink the Sabin vaccine
 

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:10.170
why when we drink the Sabin vaccine
we're not paralyzed if you look at the

00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:10.180
we're not paralyzed if you look at the
 

00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:14.010
we're not paralyzed if you look at the
growth of this virus with time in the

00:55:14.010 --> 00:55:14.020
growth of this virus with time in the
 

00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:16.410
growth of this virus with time in the
brain of these animals so they look

00:55:16.410 --> 00:55:16.420
brain of these animals so they look
 

00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:18.359
brain of these animals so they look
measuring virus here and we're measuring

00:55:18.359 --> 00:55:18.369
measuring virus here and we're measuring
 

00:55:18.369 --> 00:55:20.940
measuring virus here and we're measuring
it with time you see the virus is with

00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:20.950
it with time you see the virus is with
 

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:22.230
it with time you see the virus is with
you you don't really grow they

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:22.240
you you don't really grow they
 

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:25.710
you you don't really grow they
eventually are cleared from the cns so

00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:25.720
eventually are cleared from the cns so
 

00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:27.000
eventually are cleared from the cns so
those are the ones that don't cause

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:27.010
those are the ones that don't cause
 

00:55:27.010 --> 00:55:30.150
those are the ones that don't cause
paralysis in contrast the virus with the

00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160
paralysis in contrast the virus with the
 

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.010
paralysis in contrast the virus with the
sea grows very well in mice and that's

00:55:32.010 --> 00:55:32.020
sea grows very well in mice and that's
 

00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:33.660
sea grows very well in mice and that's
why it paralyzes them so this just

00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:33.670
why it paralyzes them so this just
 

00:55:33.670 --> 00:55:36.299
why it paralyzes them so this just
emphasizes the importance of this base

00:55:36.299 --> 00:55:36.309
emphasizes the importance of this base
 

00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:37.890
emphasizes the importance of this base
change and this is going to come back to

00:55:37.890 --> 00:55:37.900
change and this is going to come back to
 

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:42.720
change and this is going to come back to

when Saban was first testing his
 

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:48.390
when Saban was first testing his
vaccines in his first volunteers what he

00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400
vaccines in his first volunteers what he
 

00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.069
vaccines in his first volunteers what he
would do he would feed some volunteers

00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079
would do he would feed some volunteers
 

00:55:50.079 --> 00:55:52.500
would do he would feed some volunteers
his candidate vaccines and then he would

00:55:52.500 --> 00:55:52.510
his candidate vaccines and then he would
 

00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:54.930
his candidate vaccines and then he would
collect what came out in the feces and

00:55:54.930 --> 00:55:54.940
collect what came out in the feces and
 

00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:57.240
collect what came out in the feces and
then he would study that and what he

00:55:57.240 --> 00:55:57.250
then he would study that and what he
 

00:55:57.250 --> 00:55:59.220
then he would study that and what he
found was that and others found that

00:55:59.220 --> 00:55:59.230
found was that and others found that
 

00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:02.760

paralytic polio or vApp and it occurred
 

00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:58.800
paralytic polio or vApp and it occurred
at a rate of about seven to eight every

00:56:58.800 --> 00:56:58.810
at a rate of about seven to eight every
 

00:56:58.810 --> 00:57:01.590
at a rate of about seven to eight every
year in the US that it's about a rate of

00:57:01.590 --> 00:57:01.600
year in the US that it's about a rate of
 

00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:05.100
year in the US that it's about a rate of
one per 1.4 million doses of vaccine so

00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:05.110
one per 1.4 million doses of vaccine so
 

00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:07.800
one per 1.4 million doses of vaccine so
for every 1.4 million kids who got the

for every 1.4 million kids who got the
 

00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:09.720
for every 1.4 million kids who got the
polio vaccine one of them would be

00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:09.730
polio vaccine one of them would be
 

00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:12.420
polio vaccine one of them would be
paralyzed or sometimes the parent would

the child now as a result we switched to
 

00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:22.380
the child now as a result we switched to
Salk's vaccine in two thousand so there

00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:22.390
Salk's vaccine in two thousand so there
 

00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:25.700
Salk's vaccine in two thousand so there
was no more polio in the US after 1979

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:25.710
was no more polio in the US after 1979
 

00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:28.770
was no more polio in the US after 1979
except polio caused by the vaccine so

00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:28.780
except polio caused by the vaccine so
 

00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:31.710
except polio caused by the vaccine so
you can imagine this was a intelligent

Pennsylvania this was virus that had

00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359
Pennsylvania this was virus that had
 

00:58:45.359 --> 00:58:48.260
Pennsylvania this was virus that had
been imported from Turkey so after that

00:58:48.260 --> 00:58:48.270
been imported from Turkey so after that
 

00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:51.349
been imported from Turkey so after that
point there is no more wild polio in the

00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359
point there is no more wild polio in the
 

00:58:51.359 --> 00:58:53.690
point there is no more wild polio in the
US so in two thousand we switched to ipv

00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:53.700

of the work I've just told you where we

00:59:27.799 --> 00:59:27.809
of the work I've just told you where we
 

00:59:27.809 --> 00:59:30.529
of the work I've just told you where we
identified the mutations in the vaccine

00:59:30.529 --> 00:59:30.539
identified the mutations in the vaccine
 

00:59:30.539 --> 00:59:32.599
identified the mutations in the vaccine
strains that made them good vaccines and

00:59:32.599 --> 00:59:32.609
strains that made them good vaccines and
 

00:59:32.609 --> 00:59:34.880
strains that made them good vaccines and
so he said is it possible that these are

00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:34.890
so he said is it possible that these are
 

00:59:34.890 --> 00:59:37.789
so he said is it possible that these are
changing in the gut and can we pick it

00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799
changing in the gut and can we pick it
 

00:59:37.799 --> 00:59:41.329
changing in the gut and can we pick it
up so after his child was immunized he

00:59:41.329 --> 00:59:41.339
up so after his child was immunized he
 

00:59:41.339 --> 00:59:43.250
up so after his child was immunized he
had his wife give him every diaper that

00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:43.260
had his wife give him every diaper that

the virus that David was excreting it's

01:00:13.339 --> 01:00:13.349
the virus that David was excreting it's
 

01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:16.160
the virus that David was excreting it's
polio vaccine virus it has a you at 472

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:16.170
polio vaccine virus it has a you at 472
 

01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:18.740
polio vaccine virus it has a you at 472
that's the base that's very important

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:18.750
that's the base that's very important
 

01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:21.380
that's the base that's very important
for making it a safe vaccine that's the

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:21.390
for making it a safe vaccine that's the
 

01:00:21.390 --> 01:00:24.230
for making it a safe vaccine that's the
one that I studied in mice and I showed

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240
one that I studied in mice and I showed
 

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.349
one that I studied in mice and I showed
you before now the vaccine of course

01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359
you before now the vaccine of course
 

01:00:27.359 --> 01:00:31.880
you before now the vaccine of course
also has a you so that's good dm2 at 31

01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:31.890
also has a you so that's good dm2 at 31
 

01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:34.730
also has a you so that's good dm2 at 31
hours stila you very good but look at 35

01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:34.740
hours stila you very good but look at 35
 

01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:38.120
hours stila you very good but look at 35
hours it's now virus with a mixture of

01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:38.130
hours it's now virus with a mixture of
 

01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:43.760
hours it's now virus with a mixture of
you and see at 472 and by 47 hours two

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:43.770
you and see at 472 and by 47 hours two
 

01:00:43.770 --> 01:00:46.250
you and see at 472 and by 47 hours two
days after receiving the polio vaccine

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:46.260
days after receiving the polio vaccine
 

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:49.550
days after receiving the polio vaccine
orally David minor is excreting virus

01:00:49.550 --> 01:00:49.560
orally David minor is excreting virus
 

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.290
orally David minor is excreting virus
the sea which as you know and mice will

01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:51.300
the sea which as you know and mice will
 

01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:54.230
the sea which as you know and mice will
paralyze the mice and that he does for

01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240
paralyze the mice and that he does for
 

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.510
paralyze the mice and that he does for
the rest of he excreted this for about a

01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520
the rest of he excreted this for about a
 

01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:00.890
the rest of he excreted this for about a
month and you can see that these viruses

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:00.900
month and you can see that these viruses
 

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:04.280
month and you can see that these viruses
are virulent so the way we measure polio

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:04.290
are virulent so the way we measure polio
 

01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:06.260
are virulent so the way we measure polio
virulence we could of course look at

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:06.270
virulence we could of course look at
 

01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:09.080
virulence we could of course look at
paralysis in an animal or you can take

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:09.090
paralysis in an animal or you can take
 

01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:10.640
paralysis in an animal or you can take
the spinal cord and look for lesions

01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:10.650
the spinal cord and look for lesions
 

01:01:10.650 --> 01:01:13.550
the spinal cord and look for lesions
caused by polio that is killing of cells

01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:13.560
caused by polio that is killing of cells
 

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.890
caused by polio that is killing of cells
by polio replication that's where this

01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:15.900
by polio replication that's where this
 

01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:18.140
by polio replication that's where this
histological lesion score is it's very

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:18.150
histological lesion score is it's very
 

01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:21.680
histological lesion score is it's very
low for the vaccine but you can see as

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:21.690
low for the vaccine but you can see as
 

01:01:21.690 --> 01:01:24.470
low for the vaccine but you can see as
with increasing time David was excreting

01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480
with increasing time David was excreting
 

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.750
with increasing time David was excreting
virus of increased virulence so these

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760
virus of increased virulence so these
 

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:30.290
virus of increased virulence so these
two lesions scores would cause this to

01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:30.300
two lesions scores would cause this to
 

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:33.200
two lesions scores would cause this to
fail the FDA tests for being released as

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:33.210
fail the FDA tests for being released as
 

01:01:33.210 --> 01:01:36.170
fail the FDA tests for being released as
a vaccine okay so he's excreting very

01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:36.180
a vaccine okay so he's excreting very
 

01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:38.420
a vaccine okay so he's excreting very
very land virus but David minor was fine

01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:38.430
very land virus but David minor was fine
 

01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:40.940
very land virus but David minor was fine
and in fact this happens in every kid

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:40.950
and in fact this happens in every kid
 

01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:43.370
and in fact this happens in every kid
that gets polio vaccine after two or

01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:43.380
that gets polio vaccine after two or
 

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:45.440
that gets polio vaccine after two or
three days they excrete reverted virus

01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:45.450
three days they excrete reverted virus
 

01:01:45.450 --> 01:01:47.720
three days they excrete reverted virus
that is fully variant most of them are

01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:47.730
that is fully variant most of them are
 

01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:50.690
that is fully variant most of them are
fine but one in 1.4 million or not they

01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:50.700
fine but one in 1.4 million or not they
 

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:53.090
fine but one in 1.4 million or not they
get paralytic disease and this is why

01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:53.100
get paralytic disease and this is why
 

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:55.310
get paralytic disease and this is why
because in your gut you select for

01:01:55.310 --> 01:01:55.320
because in your gut you select for
 

01:01:55.320 --> 01:01:57.980
because in your gut you select for
viruses with AC the sea viruses which

01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:57.990
viruses with AC the sea viruses which
 

01:01:57.990 --> 01:02:00.020
viruses with AC the sea viruses which
contaminate the vaccine prep you can't

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:00.030
contaminate the vaccine prep you can't
 

01:02:00.030 --> 01:02:02.360
contaminate the vaccine prep you can't
avoid it they are selected for they grow

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:02.370
avoid it they are selected for they grow
 

01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:04.310
avoid it they are selected for they grow
better and within just two days they

01:02:04.310 --> 01:02:04.320
better and within just two days they
 

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.490
better and within just two days they
dominate the population so that is a

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:07.500
dominate the population so that is a
 

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:10.940
dominate the population so that is a
problem if you are using this vaccine to

01:02:10.940 --> 01:02:10.950
problem if you are using this vaccine to
 

01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:14.360
problem if you are using this vaccine to
eradicate polio so polio vaccine i think

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:14.370
eradicate polio so polio vaccine i think
 

01:02:14.370 --> 01:02:16.010
eradicate polio so polio vaccine i think
you will recognize is very different

01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:16.020
you will recognize is very different
 

01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:19.130
you will recognize is very different
from smallpox because the polio vaccine

01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:19.140
from smallpox because the polio vaccine
 

01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:21.110
from smallpox because the polio vaccine
can revert to cause the disease it's

01:02:21.110 --> 01:02:21.120
can revert to cause the disease it's
 

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.330
can revert to cause the disease it's
meant to prevent smallpox doesn't do

01:02:23.330 --> 01:02:23.340
meant to prevent smallpox doesn't do
 

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.520
meant to prevent smallpox doesn't do
that smallpox vaccine is very different

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:25.530
that smallpox vaccine is very different
 

01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:27.890
that smallpox vaccine is very different
from smallpox virus it doesn't revert to

01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:27.900
from smallpox virus it doesn't revert to
 

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:32.210
from smallpox virus it doesn't revert to
cause smallpox so when we use opv to

01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:32.220
cause smallpox so when we use opv to
 

01:02:32.220 --> 01:02:33.950
cause smallpox so when we use opv to
eradicate which is what we're doing now

01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960
eradicate which is what we're doing now
 

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:37.160
eradicate which is what we're doing now
the only source of polio is the vaccine

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:37.170
the only source of polio is the vaccine
 

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:39.260
the only source of polio is the vaccine
once you get rid of wild virus like we

01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:39.270
once you get rid of wild virus like we
 

01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:42.530
once you get rid of wild virus like we
did in the US after 1979 and that's why

01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:42.540
did in the US after 1979 and that's why
 

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:44.900
did in the US after 1979 and that's why
woho in 1988 said we're going to stop

01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:44.910
woho in 1988 said we're going to stop
 

01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:47.540
woho in 1988 said we're going to stop
immunizing at some point when we

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:47.550
immunizing at some point when we
 

01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:49.190
immunizing at some point when we
eradicate polio because we don't want to

01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200
eradicate polio because we don't want to
 

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.820
eradicate polio because we don't want to
have vaccine associated polio the

01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:52.830
have vaccine associated polio the
 

01:02:52.830 --> 01:02:56.240
have vaccine associated polio the
assumption there was that all of those

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:56.250
assumption there was that all of those
 

01:02:56.250 --> 01:02:58.640
assumption there was that all of those
vaccine derived strains which you

01:02:58.640 --> 01:02:58.650
vaccine derived strains which you
 

01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:01.040
vaccine derived strains which you
generated by immunizing millions in

01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:01.050
generated by immunizing millions in
 

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:04.040
generated by immunizing millions in
of kids who then excreted those reverted

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:04.050
of kids who then excreted those reverted
 

01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:06.230
of kids who then excreted those reverted
viruses into the sewers the assumption

01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240
viruses into the sewers the assumption
 

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:07.820
viruses into the sewers the assumption
is that they will not last very long

01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:07.830
is that they will not last very long
 

01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:10.400
is that they will not last very long
they will go away so you could stop

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:10.410
they will go away so you could stop
 

01:03:10.410 --> 01:03:11.930
they will go away so you could stop
immunizing and they would not pose a

01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:11.940
immunizing and they would not pose a
 

01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:14.690
immunizing and they would not pose a
threat to any new babies who were born

01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:14.700
threat to any new babies who were born
 

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:17.060
threat to any new babies who were born
and weren't immunized ok that was the

01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:17.070
and weren't immunized ok that was the
 

01:03:17.070 --> 01:03:19.040
and weren't immunized ok that was the
assumption wh 0 made and they turned out

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:19.050
assumption wh 0 made and they turned out
 

01:03:19.050 --> 01:03:22.040
assumption wh 0 made and they turned out
to be very wrong about that and the

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:22.050
to be very wrong about that and the
 

01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:25.340
to be very wrong about that and the
reason was they were in the 90s a number

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:25.350
reason was they were in the 90s a number
 

01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:26.660
reason was they were in the 90s a number
of outbreaks in a variety of countries

01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:26.670
of outbreaks in a variety of countries
 

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:28.490
of outbreaks in a variety of countries
starting the Dominican Republic Haiti

01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:28.500
starting the Dominican Republic Haiti
 

01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:31.340
starting the Dominican Republic Haiti
but also in Egypt Philippines Madagascar

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:31.350
but also in Egypt Philippines Madagascar
 

01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:34.490
but also in Egypt Philippines Madagascar
all outbreaks caused by vaccine derived

01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:34.500
all outbreaks caused by vaccine derived
 

01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.740
all outbreaks caused by vaccine derived
polio viruses these were in areas where

01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:36.750
polio viruses these were in areas where
 

01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:39.380
polio viruses these were in areas where
immunization coverage dropped so there

01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:39.390
immunization coverage dropped so there
 

01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:42.380
immunization coverage dropped so there
wasn't much polio it was failure to

01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:42.390
wasn't much polio it was failure to
 

01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:43.880
wasn't much polio it was failure to
immunize sufficient numbers of people

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:43.890
immunize sufficient numbers of people
 

01:03:43.890 --> 01:03:46.130
immunize sufficient numbers of people
and the virus somehow got into these

01:03:46.130 --> 01:03:46.140
and the virus somehow got into these
 

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:48.740
and the virus somehow got into these
populations and cause outbreaks but it

01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:48.750
populations and cause outbreaks but it
 

01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:50.600
populations and cause outbreaks but it
was vaccine derived virus we can tell

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:50.610
was vaccine derived virus we can tell
 

01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:52.580
was vaccine derived virus we can tell
that very easily we sequence it we can

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:52.590
that very easily we sequence it we can
 

01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:55.910
that very easily we sequence it we can
see that saban derive so these are

01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920
see that saban derive so these are
 

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:58.310
see that saban derive so these are
vaccine drive viruses that regain

01:03:58.310 --> 01:03:58.320
vaccine drive viruses that regain
 

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.530
vaccine drive viruses that regain

to fill miner his virus that he
excavated and they also can spread in

01:04:05.030 --> 01:04:05.040
excavated and they also can spread in
 

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:09.800
excavated and they also can spread in
human populations in addition we have

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:09.810
human populations in addition we have
 

01:04:09.810 --> 01:04:11.800
human populations in addition we have
many people in the world who have

01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:11.810
many people in the world who have
 

01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:13.730
many people in the world who have
immunodeficiencies in particular people

01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:13.740
immunodeficiencies in particular people
 

01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:15.440
immunodeficiencies in particular people
who lack b-cells they can't make

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:15.450
who lack b-cells they can't make
 

01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:17.810
who lack b-cells they can't make
antibodies you can't tell that they lack

01:04:17.810 --> 01:04:17.820
antibodies you can't tell that they lack
 

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:20.030
antibodies you can't tell that they lack
antibodies at birth so shortly after

01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:20.040
antibodies at birth so shortly after
 

01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:22.730
antibodies at birth so shortly after
birth you give them polio vaccine they

01:04:22.730 --> 01:04:22.740
birth you give them polio vaccine they
 

01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:24.770
birth you give them polio vaccine they
can excrete it for years it's been

01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:24.780
can excrete it for years it's been
 

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:26.720
can excrete it for years it's been
documented that these individuals will

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:26.730
documented that these individuals will
 

01:04:26.730 --> 01:04:29.450
documented that these individuals will
excrete polio up to 15 years it's

01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:29.460
excrete polio up to 15 years it's
 

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:31.880
excrete polio up to 15 years it's
another reservoir of infection and in

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:31.890
another reservoir of infection and in
 

01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:34.340
another reservoir of infection and in
fact many of these strains have come

01:04:34.340 --> 01:04:34.350
fact many of these strains have come
 

01:04:34.350 --> 01:04:36.320
fact many of these strains have come
from immunocompromised people to cause

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:36.330
from immunocompromised people to cause
 

01:04:36.330 --> 01:04:40.430
from immunocompromised people to cause
these outbreaks and in these areas and

01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:40.440
these outbreaks and in these areas and
 

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.080
these outbreaks and in these areas and
so this is a summary of some of these

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:42.090
so this is a summary of some of these
 

01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:45.980
so this is a summary of some of these
outbreaks first one is in Dominican

01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:45.990
outbreaks first one is in Dominican
 

01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:50.260
outbreaks first one is in Dominican
Republic Haiti 21 cases in july of 2000

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:50.270
Republic Haiti 21 cases in july of 2000
 

01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:53.210
Republic Haiti 21 cases in july of 2000
so you can isolate virus from these

01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:53.220
so you can isolate virus from these
 

01:04:53.220 --> 01:04:55.670
so you can isolate virus from these
individuals you can sequence it and then

01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680
individuals you can sequence it and then
 

01:04:55.680 --> 01:04:57.460
individuals you can sequence it and then
you can say how many years it's been

01:04:57.460 --> 01:04:57.470
you can say how many years it's been
 

01:04:57.470 --> 01:05:00.260
you can say how many years it's been
circulating in humans because polio

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:00.270
circulating in humans because polio
 

01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:02.600
circulating in humans because polio
changes when polio is circulating in the

01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:02.610
changes when polio is circulating in the
 

01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:04.340
changes when polio is circulating in the
population it changes at a rate of one

01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:04.350
population it changes at a rate of one
 

01:05:04.350 --> 01:05:07.040
population it changes at a rate of one
percent a year it has a very steady

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:07.050
percent a year it has a very steady
 

01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:09.440
percent a year it has a very steady
clock so you can count the number of

01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:09.450
clock so you can count the number of
 

01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:12.290
clock so you can count the number of
changes in any isolate that you get

01:05:12.290 --> 01:05:12.300
changes in any isolate that you get
 

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:14.450
changes in any isolate that you get
compare it to the save and strain

01:05:14.450 --> 01:05:14.460
compare it to the save and strain
 

01:05:14.460 --> 01:05:16.849
compare it to the save and strain
and say how many years his virus has

01:05:16.849 --> 01:05:16.859
and say how many years his virus has
 

01:05:16.859 --> 01:05:18.829
and say how many years his virus has
been circulating so here you can see

01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:18.839
been circulating so here you can see
 

01:05:18.839 --> 01:05:20.480
been circulating so here you can see
this the virus that caused this outbreak

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:20.490
this the virus that caused this outbreak
 

01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:23.240
this the virus that caused this outbreak
in Hispaniola circulated for two years

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:23.250
in Hispaniola circulated for two years
 

01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:26.000
in Hispaniola circulated for two years
before it caused the outbreak and it's

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:26.010
before it caused the outbreak and it's
 

01:05:26.010 --> 01:05:27.589
before it caused the outbreak and it's
thought that this came from an

01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599
thought that this came from an
 

01:05:27.599 --> 01:05:29.240
thought that this came from an
immunocompromised person who was

01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:29.250
immunocompromised person who was
 

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:31.720
immunocompromised person who was
harboring the virus for many many years

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:31.730
harboring the virus for many many years
 

01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:35.870
harboring the virus for many many years
now there are 21 cases of paralytic

01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880
now there are 21 cases of paralytic
 

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:38.000
now there are 21 cases of paralytic
disease but remember the number of

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:38.010
disease but remember the number of
 

01:05:38.010 --> 01:05:39.680
disease but remember the number of
infections is much greater and in this

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:39.690
infections is much greater and in this
 

01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:42.650
infections is much greater and in this
case it was estimated to be one to two

01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:42.660
case it was estimated to be one to two
 

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:44.750
case it was estimated to be one to two
hundred thousand total people infections

01:05:44.750 --> 01:05:44.760
hundred thousand total people infections
 

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:47.599
hundred thousand total people infections
so 21 cases may not seem like much but

01:05:47.599 --> 01:05:47.609
so 21 cases may not seem like much but
 

01:05:47.609 --> 01:05:48.770
so 21 cases may not seem like much but
you always have to remember that there

01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:48.780
you always have to remember that there
 

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:50.390
you always have to remember that there
are many many more people infected and

01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400
are many many more people infected and
 

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:51.770
are many many more people infected and
they can spread the virus to other

01:05:51.770 --> 01:05:51.780
they can spread the virus to other
 

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:53.870
they can spread the virus to other
people as well so even today if we have

01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880
people as well so even today if we have
 

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:55.849
people as well so even today if we have
one case of polio in India so far this

01:05:55.849 --> 01:05:55.859
one case of polio in India so far this
 

01:05:55.859 --> 01:05:57.950
one case of polio in India so far this
year which is the case there could be a

hundred or a thousand people infected

01:05:59.780 --> 01:05:59.790
hundred or a thousand people infected
 

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:03.230
hundred or a thousand people infected
with the virus still and these are all

01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240
with the virus still and these are all
 

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:05.030
with the virus still and these are all
other outbreaks that have occurred

01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:05.040
other outbreaks that have occurred

these vaccine derived viruses would go
 

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.589
these vaccine derived viruses would go
away the day you stop immunizing but

01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599
away the day you stop immunizing but
 

01:06:24.599 --> 01:06:27.020
away the day you stop immunizing but
they don't they circulate for years so

01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:27.030
they don't they circulate for years so
 

01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:29.960
they don't they circulate for years so
you can't just stop immunizing and this

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:29.970
you can't just stop immunizing and this
 

01:06:29.970 --> 01:06:31.970
you can't just stop immunizing and this

44 years old she went to the hospital
 

01:06:46.530 --> 01:06:48.950
44 years old she went to the hospital
with symptoms of muscle pain and

what was wrong with her but eventually
 

01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:58.040
what was wrong with her but eventually
they isolated polio from her and

01:06:58.040 --> 01:06:58.050
they isolated polio from her and
 

01:06:58.050 --> 01:07:00.680
they isolated polio from her and
sequenced it and calculated that she had

apparently she got Colin I so this is an
 

01:07:30.059 --> 01:07:31.789
apparently she got Colin I so this is an
example of what can happen with these

01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799
example of what can happen with these
 

01:07:31.799 --> 01:07:33.469

there are people around her that are not
immunized they can be infected as well

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:40.970
immunized they can be infected as well
 

01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:43.489
immunized they can be infected as well
so what this means to summarize that

01:07:43.489 --> 01:07:43.499
so what this means to summarize that
 

01:07:43.499 --> 01:07:46.130
so what this means to summarize that
these outbreaks show that these strains

01:07:46.130 --> 01:07:46.140
these outbreaks show that these strains
 

01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:48.950
these outbreaks show that these strains
of OPV can circulate even in immune

01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960
of OPV can circulate even in immune
 

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:51.799
of OPV can circulate even in immune
populations and many of those outbreaks

01:07:51.799 --> 01:07:51.809
populations and many of those outbreaks
 

01:07:51.809 --> 01:07:53.539
populations and many of those outbreaks
they were circulating in immune

01:07:53.539 --> 01:07:53.549
they were circulating in immune
 

01:07:53.549 --> 01:07:56.380
they were circulating in immune
populations and as I said if you stop

01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:56.390
populations and as I said if you stop
 

01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:58.700
populations and as I said if you stop
this mimics what would happen if you

01:07:58.700 --> 01:07:58.710
this mimics what would happen if you
 

01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:00.289
this mimics what would happen if you
stop immunizing you're going to have

01:08:00.289 --> 01:08:00.299
stop immunizing you're going to have
 

01:08:00.299 --> 01:08:02.630
stop immunizing you're going to have
circulation of these revertants which

01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640
circulation of these revertants which
 

01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:04.400
circulation of these revertants which
will infect new children who aren't

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:04.410
will infect new children who aren't
 

01:08:04.410 --> 01:08:06.979
will infect new children who aren't
immunized so I don't think you can stop

01:08:06.979 --> 01:08:06.989
immunized so I don't think you can stop
 

01:08:06.989 --> 01:08:10.069
immunized so I don't think you can stop
immunizing as wh 0 that originally

01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079

proposed so we after we eradicate polio

01:08:14.109 --> 01:08:14.119
proposed so we after we eradicate polio
 

01:08:14.119 --> 01:08:17.749
proposed so we after we eradicate polio
you have to immunize against opv

01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759
you have to immunize against opv
 

01:08:17.759 --> 01:08:19.760
you have to immunize against opv
essentially I think you have to switch

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:19.770
essentially I think you have to switch
 

01:08:19.770 --> 01:08:23.120
essentially I think you have to switch

the circulating vaccine derived viruses
go away now this is a problem because I

01:08:28.039 --> 01:08:28.049
go away now this is a problem because I
 

01:08:28.049 --> 01:08:31.189
go away now this is a problem because I
PV costs more than OPV OPV you can make

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199
PV costs more than OPV OPV you can make
 

01:08:31.199 --> 01:08:33.709
PV costs more than OPV OPV you can make
for about five cents a dose and I PV is

01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:33.719
for about five cents a dose and I PV is
 

01:08:33.719 --> 01:08:36.589
for about five cents a dose and I PV is
about a bucket dose but we can just get

01:08:36.589 --> 01:08:36.599
about a bucket dose but we can just get
 

01:08:36.599 --> 01:08:39.160
about a bucket dose but we can just get
more money from from bill gates at Al

01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:39.170
more money from from bill gates at Al
 

01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:43.309
more money from from bill gates at Al
real problem is that these inactivated

01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:43.319
real problem is that these inactivated
 

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:45.439
real problem is that these inactivated
vaccines have not really been shown to

01:08:45.439 --> 01:08:45.449
vaccines have not really been shown to
 

01:08:45.449 --> 01:08:47.570
vaccines have not really been shown to
be effective in certain tropical

01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:47.580
be effective in certain tropical
 

01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:49.099
be effective in certain tropical
underdeveloped countries so it's a bit

01:08:49.099 --> 01:08:49.109
underdeveloped countries so it's a bit
 

01:08:49.109 --> 01:08:50.839
underdeveloped countries so it's a bit
of an experiment we may have to develop

01:08:50.839 --> 01:08:50.849
of an experiment we may have to develop
 

01:08:50.849 --> 01:08:53.200
of an experiment we may have to develop
about a vaccine that is in fact better

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:53.210
about a vaccine that is in fact better
 

01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:56.300
about a vaccine that is in fact better
but I think this makes the most sense to

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:56.310
but I think this makes the most sense to
 

01:08:56.310 --> 01:08:59.570
but I think this makes the most sense to
switch to ipv and then you have to

01:08:59.570 --> 01:08:59.580
switch to ipv and then you have to
 

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:02.209
switch to ipv and then you have to
monitor the environment to be able to

01:09:02.209 --> 01:09:02.219
monitor the environment to be able to
 

01:09:02.219 --> 01:09:03.979
monitor the environment to be able to
know when there's no more circulating

01:09:03.979 --> 01:09:03.989
know when there's no more circulating
 

01:09:03.989 --> 01:09:06.470
know when there's no more circulating
vaccine derived polio present and so

01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480
vaccine derived polio present and so
 

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.999
vaccine derived polio present and so
there's a good example of this was done

01:09:07.999 --> 01:09:08.009
there's a good example of this was done
 

01:09:08.009 --> 01:09:11.510
there's a good example of this was done
in New Zealand they switched from opv to

01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520
in New Zealand they switched from opv to
 

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:14.599
in New Zealand they switched from opv to
ipv in 2002 and they monitor the

01:09:14.599 --> 01:09:14.609

sewage treatment plants in the country
 

01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:20.809
sewage treatment plants in the country
so here we have % positives for polio

01:09:20.809 --> 01:09:20.819
so here we have % positives for polio
 

01:09:20.819 --> 01:09:24.800
so here we have % positives for polio
virus with time starting in 2002 through

01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:24.810
virus with time starting in 2002 through
 

01:09:24.810 --> 01:09:28.160
virus with time starting in 2002 through
2003 so you can see that the amount of

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:28.170
2003 so you can see that the amount of
 

01:09:28.170 --> 01:09:31.220
2003 so you can see that the amount of
vire OPV is a circulating vaccine drive

01:09:31.220 --> 01:09:31.230
vire OPV is a circulating vaccine drive
 

01:09:31.230 --> 01:09:34.070

virus within a year basically declines

01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080
virus within a year basically declines
 

01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:35.839
virus within a year basically declines
there's still a little background this

01:09:35.839 --> 01:09:35.849
there's still a little background this
 

01:09:35.849 --> 01:09:37.939
there's still a little background this
is an imported opv so they could take

01:09:37.939 --> 01:09:37.949
is an imported opv so they could take
 

01:09:37.949 --> 01:09:39.729
is an imported opv so they could take
this virus and sequence it and say

01:09:39.729 --> 01:09:39.739
this virus and sequence it and say
 

01:09:39.739 --> 01:09:42.399
this virus and sequence it and say
it's opv and we haven't used OPV and

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:42.409
it's opv and we haven't used OPV and
 

01:09:42.409 --> 01:09:44.349
it's opv and we haven't used OPV and
since the previous year so it was

01:09:44.349 --> 01:09:44.359
since the previous year so it was
 

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:45.879
since the previous year so it was
probably important and eventually you

01:09:45.879 --> 01:09:45.889
probably important and eventually you
 

01:09:45.889 --> 01:09:47.709
probably important and eventually you
detect no virus so this is what I would

01:09:47.709 --> 01:09:47.719
detect no virus so this is what I would
 

01:09:47.719 --> 01:09:51.279
detect no virus so this is what I would
propose globally you switch the opv ipv

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:51.289
propose globally you switch the opv ipv
 

01:09:51.289 --> 01:09:53.919
propose globally you switch the opv ipv
and then monitor the environment for the

01:09:53.919 --> 01:09:53.929
and then monitor the environment for the
 

01:09:53.929 --> 01:09:55.870
and then monitor the environment for the
presence of vaccine derive viruses and

01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:55.880
presence of vaccine derive viruses and
 

01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:56.950
presence of vaccine derive viruses and
at some point you have to make a

01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960
at some point you have to make a
 

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:59.529
at some point you have to make a
decision we stopped immunizing I don't

01:09:59.529 --> 01:09:59.539
decision we stopped immunizing I don't
 

01:09:59.539 --> 01:10:01.149
decision we stopped immunizing I don't
know who will make that decision but

01:10:01.149 --> 01:10:01.159
know who will make that decision but
 

01:10:01.159 --> 01:10:04.169
know who will make that decision but
it's a it's a pretty important one to do

01:10:04.169 --> 01:10:04.179
it's a it's a pretty important one to do
 

01:10:04.179 --> 01:10:08.589
it's a it's a pretty important one to do
so I number of years ago forget when

01:10:08.589 --> 01:10:08.599
so I number of years ago forget when
 

01:10:08.599 --> 01:10:12.790
so I number of years ago forget when
this was early 90s perhaps I was at a

01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:12.800
this was early 90s perhaps I was at a
 

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:15.580
this was early 90s perhaps I was at a
meeting in the National Academy and I

01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:15.590
meeting in the National Academy and I
 

01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:19.120
meeting in the National Academy and I
spoke about this whole issue and I said

01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:19.130
spoke about this whole issue and I said
 

01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:22.330
spoke about this whole issue and I said
we should switch to ipv and da Henderson

01:10:22.330 --> 01:10:22.340
we should switch to ipv and da Henderson
 

01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:23.859
we should switch to ipv and da Henderson
was there and I think he talked to you

01:10:23.859 --> 01:10:23.869
was there and I think he talked to you
 

01:10:23.869 --> 01:10:26.549
was there and I think he talked to you
in this series and he got up and he said

01:10:26.549 --> 01:10:26.559
in this series and he got up and he said
 

01:10:26.559 --> 01:10:29.350
in this series and he got up and he said
so we have then say seven or eight years

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360
so we have then say seven or eight years
 

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.330
so we have then say seven or eight years
whatever it is to gear up to the vaccine

01:10:31.330 --> 01:10:31.340
whatever it is to gear up to the vaccine
 

01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:32.799
whatever it is to gear up to the vaccine
then another ten years to use

01:10:32.799 --> 01:10:32.809
then another ten years to use
 

01:10:32.809 --> 01:10:34.839
then another ten years to use
inactivated this is just totally

01:10:34.839 --> 01:10:34.849
inactivated this is just totally
 

01:10:34.849 --> 01:10:36.790

there's no way it's going to come about
 

01:10:39.769 --> 01:10:41.890
there's no way it's going to come about
and as an end game strategy it is

01:10:41.890 --> 01:10:41.900
and as an end game strategy it is
 

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:43.390
and as an end game strategy it is
dreaming to believe that this is

01:10:43.390 --> 01:10:43.400
dreaming to believe that this is
 

01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:46.720
dreaming to believe that this is
reasonable so it is just not on so I was

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:46.730
reasonable so it is just not on so I was
 

01:10:46.730 --> 01:10:48.910
reasonable so it is just not on so I was
surprised because da Henderson

01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:48.920
surprised because da Henderson
 

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:51.220
surprised because da Henderson
eradicated smallpox so he must know

eradicated smallpox so he must know
 

01:10:51.230 --> 01:10:54.370
eradicated smallpox so he must know
right but now the wh 0 has decided that

01:10:54.370 --> 01:10:54.380
right but now the wh 0 has decided that
 

01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:56.950
right but now the wh 0 has decided that
we need to transition to ipv so it's

01:10:56.950 --> 01:10:56.960
we need to transition to ipv so it's
 

01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:59.560
we need to transition to ipv so it's
going to happen somehow so the moral is

01:10:59.560 --> 01:10:59.570
going to happen somehow so the moral is
 

01:10:59.570 --> 01:11:02.259

that when someone speaks forcefully

think so da Henderson now says yeah we

01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:07.130
think so da Henderson now says yeah we
 

01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:09.310

have to use ipv but when I got up and

have to use ipv but when I got up and
 

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.720
have to use ipv but when I got up and
suggest that if you said it's not going

to happen I thought that would be

01:11:11.859 --> 01:11:11.869
to happen I thought that would be

01:12:58.190 --> 01:12:58.200
derived polio you can't stop unless you
 

01:12:58.200 --> 01:13:00.830
derived polio you can't stop unless you
make sure they are not there so vaccine

01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:00.840
make sure they are not there so vaccine
 

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:03.170
make sure they are not there so vaccine
derive type 2 caused this outbreak in

01:13:03.170 --> 01:13:03.180
derive type 2 caused this outbreak in
 

01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:07.040
derive type 2 caused this outbreak in
Nigeria so you really can't consider

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:07.050
Nigeria so you really can't consider
 

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:08.750
Nigeria so you really can't consider
type to eradicate it if there's still

01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760
type to eradicate it if there's still
 

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.550
type to eradicate it if there's still
vaccine derive type 2 and it's still

01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560
vaccine derive type 2 and it's still
 

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.590
vaccine derive type 2 and it's still
used in some parts of the world the type

01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600
used in some parts of the world the type
 

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:15.920
used in some parts of the world the type
to OPV so here's the situation at the

01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:15.930
to OPV so here's the situation at the
 

01:13:15.930 --> 01:13:19.600
to OPV so here's the situation at the
moment I will wrap it up very quickly

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:19.610
moment I will wrap it up very quickly
 

01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:21.950
moment I will wrap it up very quickly
2011 I just got these data yesterday you

01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:21.960
2011 I just got these data yesterday you
 

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:23.780
2011 I just got these data yesterday you
can go to polio eradication org and you

01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:23.790
can go to polio eradication org and you
 

01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:25.940
can go to polio eradication org and you
get daily numbers on the eradication

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:25.950
get daily numbers on the eradication
 

01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:27.650
get daily numbers on the eradication
effort so these are all the countries in

01:13:27.650 --> 01:13:27.660
effort so these are all the countries in
 

01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:29.930
effort so these are all the countries in
yellow where we still have polio the

01:13:29.930 --> 01:13:29.940
yellow where we still have polio the
 

01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:32.090
yellow where we still have polio the
ones with solid yellow we call the

01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:32.100
ones with solid yellow we call the
 

01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:34.640
ones with solid yellow we call the
endemic countries we have never gotten

01:13:34.640 --> 01:13:34.650
endemic countries we have never gotten
 

01:13:34.650 --> 01:13:36.260
endemic countries we have never gotten
rid of polio from these countries

01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:36.270
rid of polio from these countries
 

01:13:36.270 --> 01:13:39.740
rid of polio from these countries
Nigeria India Afghanistan and Pakistan

01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:39.750
Nigeria India Afghanistan and Pakistan
 

01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:42.950
Nigeria India Afghanistan and Pakistan
and then the others which have little

01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960
and then the others which have little
 

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.420
and then the others which have little
hatch marks these are importation

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:44.430
hatch marks these are importation
 

01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:47.360
hatch marks these are importation
countries so these may or may not have

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:47.370
countries so these may or may not have
 

01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:48.980
countries so these may or may not have
been free of polio at one time but then

01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:48.990
been free of polio at one time but then
 

01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:50.780
been free of polio at one time but then
it comes back in and the reason it comes

01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:50.790
it comes back in and the reason it comes
 

01:13:50.790 --> 01:13:52.850
it comes back in and the reason it comes
back in is because it's still present in

01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:52.860
back in is because it's still present in
 

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:55.400
back in is because it's still present in
these other countries and global travel

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:55.410
these other countries and global travel
 

01:13:55.410 --> 01:13:57.350
these other countries and global travel
brings it and do you think there's a

01:13:57.350 --> 01:13:57.360
brings it and do you think there's a
 

01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.210
brings it and do you think there's a
paralyzed person sitting on an airplane

01:13:59.210 --> 01:13:59.220
paralyzed person sitting on an airplane
 

01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:01.010
paralyzed person sitting on an airplane
bringing the button oh it's one of the

01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:01.020
bringing the button oh it's one of the
 

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:02.750
bringing the button oh it's one of the
people who's just shedding virus but has

01:14:02.750 --> 01:14:02.760
people who's just shedding virus but has
 

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.120
people who's just shedding virus but has
a cough or maybe no symptoms so that's

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:05.130
a cough or maybe no symptoms so that's
 

01:14:05.130 --> 01:14:06.200
a cough or maybe no symptoms so that's
why it's

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:06.210
why it's
 

01:14:06.210 --> 01:14:09.770
why it's
easy to spread so here the numbers last

01:14:09.770 --> 01:14:09.780
easy to spread so here the numbers last
 

01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:15.850
easy to spread so here the numbers last
year 2010 globally 1349 cases of polio

01:14:15.850 --> 01:14:15.860
year 2010 globally 1349 cases of polio
 

01:14:15.860 --> 01:14:19.790
year 2010 globally 1349 cases of polio
232 in endemic countries 1000 over a

01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:19.800
232 in endemic countries 1000 over a
 

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:21.890
232 in endemic countries 1000 over a
thousand in non endemic countries these

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:21.900
thousand in non endemic countries these
 

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:25.150
thousand in non endemic countries these
are introduced cases from other places

01:14:25.150 --> 01:14:25.160
are introduced cases from other places
 

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.400
are introduced cases from other places
so you multiply this times 100 to get

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:28.410
so you multiply this times 100 to get
 

01:14:28.410 --> 01:14:30.200
so you multiply this times 100 to get
the total number of people infected so a

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:30.210
the total number of people infected so a
 

01:14:30.210 --> 01:14:31.700
the total number of people infected so a
thousand looks like a good number but

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:31.710
thousand looks like a good number but
 

01:14:31.710 --> 01:14:34.220
thousand looks like a good number but
really 134,000 people are still shedding

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:34.230
really 134,000 people are still shedding
 

01:14:34.230 --> 01:14:35.959
really 134,000 people are still shedding
virus the point is you have to be

01:14:35.959 --> 01:14:35.969
virus the point is you have to be
 

01:14:35.969 --> 01:14:38.209
virus the point is you have to be
vigilant even if you get the cases down

01:14:38.209 --> 01:14:38.219
vigilant even if you get the cases down
 

01:14:38.219 --> 01:14:39.650
vigilant even if you get the cases down
low you have to keep going in and

01:14:39.650 --> 01:14:39.660
low you have to keep going in and
 

01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:42.229
low you have to keep going in and
immunizing massive campaigns and that

01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239
immunizing massive campaigns and that
 

01:14:42.239 --> 01:14:45.290
immunizing massive campaigns and that
may not be so easy to do this year we

01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:45.300
may not be so easy to do this year we
 

01:14:45.300 --> 01:14:49.040
may not be so easy to do this year we
have to date 252 cases which is pretty

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:49.050
have to date 252 cases which is pretty
 

01:14:49.050 --> 01:14:52.700
have to date 252 cases which is pretty
good 80 for an endemic 180 68 and

01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:52.710
good 80 for an endemic 180 68 and
 

01:14:52.710 --> 01:14:54.110
good 80 for an endemic 180 68 and
non-endemic so we're doing a little

01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120
non-endemic so we're doing a little
 

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:57.410
non-endemic so we're doing a little
better than the same time last year so

01:14:57.410 --> 01:14:57.420
better than the same time last year so
 

01:14:57.420 --> 01:14:59.800
better than the same time last year so
this is good it looks pretty good and

01:14:59.800 --> 01:14:59.810
this is good it looks pretty good and
 

01:14:59.810 --> 01:15:03.140
this is good it looks pretty good and
here are the numbers for all the

01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:03.150
here are the numbers for all the
 

01:15:03.150 --> 01:15:04.880
here are the numbers for all the
countries where cases of polio be

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:04.890
countries where cases of polio be
 

01:15:04.890 --> 01:15:07.459
countries where cases of polio be
reported and I just want to point out a

01:15:07.459 --> 01:15:07.469
reported and I just want to point out a
 

01:15:07.469 --> 01:15:09.310
reported and I just want to point out a
couple of things here is year-to-date

01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:09.320
couple of things here is year-to-date
 

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:12.620
couple of things here is year-to-date
2011 so India which has been one of the

01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:12.630
2011 so India which has been one of the
 

01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:15.140
2011 so India which has been one of the
toughest countries to bring down the

01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:15.150
toughest countries to bring down the
 

01:15:15.150 --> 01:15:17.959
toughest countries to bring down the
numbers it's been at a thousand of so

01:15:17.959 --> 01:15:17.969
numbers it's been at a thousand of so
 

01:15:17.969 --> 01:15:20.120
numbers it's been at a thousand of so
cases for the last five years suddenly

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:20.130
cases for the last five years suddenly
 

01:15:20.130 --> 01:15:25.940
cases for the last five years suddenly
now we have one case so far in 2011 2010

01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:25.950
now we have one case so far in 2011 2010
 

01:15:25.950 --> 01:15:28.910
now we have one case so far in 2011 2010
22 so that's really good but the monsoon

01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920
22 so that's really good but the monsoon
 

01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:30.530
22 so that's really good but the monsoon
season is now coming on and during that

01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:30.540
season is now coming on and during that
 

01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:32.240
season is now coming on and during that
time there's a lot of transmission so

01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:32.250
time there's a lot of transmission so
 

01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:34.280
time there's a lot of transmission so
we'll see what happens again remember

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:34.290
we'll see what happens again remember
 

01:15:34.290 --> 01:15:35.390
we'll see what happens again remember
there are at least a hundred people

01:15:35.390 --> 01:15:35.400
there are at least a hundred people
 

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:37.160
there are at least a hundred people
infected so you have to keep going in

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:37.170
infected so you have to keep going in
 

01:15:37.170 --> 01:15:40.100
infected so you have to keep going in
and immunizing that's still a lot of

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:40.110
and immunizing that's still a lot of
 

01:15:40.110 --> 01:15:42.950
and immunizing that's still a lot of
cases in Pakistan Pakistan and

01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960
cases in Pakistan Pakistan and
 

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.900
cases in Pakistan Pakistan and
Afghanistan have have a problem because

01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:44.910
Afghanistan have have a problem because
 

01:15:44.910 --> 01:15:46.520
Afghanistan have have a problem because
it's sometimes very difficult to get in

01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:46.530
it's sometimes very difficult to get in
 

01:15:46.530 --> 01:15:48.170
it's sometimes very difficult to get in
and immunize there's armed conflict

01:15:48.170 --> 01:15:48.180
and immunize there's armed conflict
 

01:15:48.180 --> 01:15:50.390
and immunize there's armed conflict
going on and the teams that have the

01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400
going on and the teams that have the
 

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:52.760
going on and the teams that have the
vaccine often cannot immunize kids and

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:52.770
vaccine often cannot immunize kids and
 

01:15:52.770 --> 01:15:54.590
vaccine often cannot immunize kids and
so they don't get vaccine then you have

01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600
so they don't get vaccine then you have
 

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.530
so they don't get vaccine then you have
outbreaks of polio there have been some

01:15:57.530 --> 01:15:57.540
outbreaks of polio there have been some
 

01:15:57.540 --> 01:15:59.150
outbreaks of polio there have been some
outbreaks in Africa this year you can

01:15:59.150 --> 01:15:59.160
outbreaks in Africa this year you can
 

01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.520
outbreaks in Africa this year you can
see dr congo and Chad had a number of

01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:01.530
see dr congo and Chad had a number of
 

01:16:01.530 --> 01:16:03.170
see dr congo and Chad had a number of
cases these were all imported from other

01:16:03.170 --> 01:16:03.180
cases these were all imported from other
 

01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:07.130
cases these were all imported from other
places and also last year in Tajikistan

01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:07.140
places and also last year in Tajikistan
 

01:16:07.140 --> 01:16:09.550
places and also last year in Tajikistan
there were quite a few cases of polio

01:16:09.550 --> 01:16:09.560
there were quite a few cases of polio
 

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:12.979
there were quite a few cases of polio
imported from India so this emphasizes

01:16:12.979 --> 01:16:12.989
imported from India so this emphasizes
 

01:16:12.989 --> 01:16:15.020
imported from India so this emphasizes
that you can get the numbers down very

01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:15.030
that you can get the numbers down very
 

01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:17.479
that you can get the numbers down very
low but you have to keep hammering with

01:16:17.479 --> 01:16:17.489
low but you have to keep hammering with
 

01:16:17.489 --> 01:16:19.040
low but you have to keep hammering with
the immunization you can't leave a

01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:19.050
the immunization you can't leave a
 

01:16:19.050 --> 01:16:20.150
the immunization you can't leave a
pockets open

01:16:20.150 --> 01:16:20.160
pockets open
 

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:22.220
pockets open
but it's a problem of course if there is

01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:22.230
but it's a problem of course if there is
 

01:16:22.230 --> 01:16:23.990
but it's a problem of course if there is
a war and in places like the dr congo

01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000
a war and in places like the dr congo
 

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.790
a war and in places like the dr congo
there's a lot of unrest and it's very

01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800
there's a lot of unrest and it's very
 

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:27.920
there's a lot of unrest and it's very
difficult to immunize everyone so we

01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:27.930
difficult to immunize everyone so we
 

01:16:27.930 --> 01:16:29.660
difficult to immunize everyone so we
have a great vaccine that will

01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:29.670
have a great vaccine that will
 

01:16:29.670 --> 01:16:33.710
have a great vaccine that will
definitely eradicate but it's often hard

01:16:33.710 --> 01:16:33.720
definitely eradicate but it's often hard
 

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:36.110
definitely eradicate but it's often hard
to do it now remember even if we

01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120
to do it now remember even if we
 

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:39.800
to do it now remember even if we
eradicate polio from the globe as long

01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:39.810
eradicate polio from the globe as long
 

01:16:39.810 --> 01:16:42.380
eradicate polio from the globe as long
as we have the sequence you can make it

01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:42.390
as we have the sequence you can make it
 

01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:44.990
as we have the sequence you can make it
again so I think it may be possible to

01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000
again so I think it may be possible to
 

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:48.350
again so I think it may be possible to
eradicate polio but we do have that

01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360
eradicate polio but we do have that
 

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.360
eradicate polio but we do have that
sequence that I made years ago sitting

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:50.370
sequence that I made years ago sitting

they could make it and reintroduce it so

they could make it and reintroduce it so
 

01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:56.360
they could make it and reintroduce it so
we have to stop pile vaccines after

we have to stop pile vaccines after
 

01:16:56.370 --> 01:16:59.440

make the same amino acid but the
 

01:18:06.450 --> 01:18:08.060
make the same amino acid but the
sequence was different so you know the

01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:08.070
sequence was different so you know the
 

01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:10.190
sequence was different so you know the
code has wobble so you can do that and

01:18:10.190 --> 01:18:10.200
code has wobble so you can do that and
 

01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:12.260

not clear who would do this but this

anti-vaccine movement which stems from a

01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:41.620
anti-vaccine movement which stems from a
 

01:20:41.620 --> 01:20:45.330
anti-vaccine movement which stems from a
number of sources there have been some

01:20:45.330 --> 01:20:45.340
number of sources there have been some
 

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:47.580
number of sources there have been some
problems with vaccines and one of them

01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:47.590
problems with vaccines and one of them
 

01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:50.280
problems with vaccines and one of them
we pointed out here the cutter incident

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:50.290
we pointed out here the cutter incident
 

01:20:50.290 --> 01:20:53.820
we pointed out here the cutter incident
began at all in the 50s other vaccines

01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:53.830
began at all in the 50s other vaccines
 

01:20:53.830 --> 01:20:56.700
began at all in the 50s other vaccines
over the years have had side effects and

01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:56.710
over the years have had side effects and
 

01:20:56.710 --> 01:21:00.600
over the years have had side effects and
these these I think when amplified and

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:00.610
these these I think when amplified and
 

01:21:00.610 --> 01:21:03.600
these these I think when amplified and
used in the wrong hands can be used to

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:03.610
used in the wrong hands can be used to
 

01:21:03.610 --> 01:21:06.270

misinform people about the general

01:21:06.270 --> 01:21:06.280
misinform people about the general
 

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:10.020
misinform people about the general
safety of vaccines so I think that and

01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:10.030
safety of vaccines so I think that and
 

01:21:10.030 --> 01:21:12.600
safety of vaccines so I think that and
couple that with the internet now and

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:12.610
couple that with the internet now and
 

01:21:12.610 --> 01:21:14.520
couple that with the internet now and
that everyone can write whatever they

because this happened and that happened

01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:19.990
because this happened and that happened
 

01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:22.950

and it's all false pretty much and

01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960
and it's all false pretty much and
 

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:25.140

people find these and they think they're

people find these and they think they're
 

01:21:25.150 --> 01:21:27.600

they're real and that's in part why I'm
