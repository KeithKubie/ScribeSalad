00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960
blatant contradiction and I think it
 

00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:32.840
blatant contradiction and I think it
part is to be fair I don't think that a

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:32.850
part is to be fair I don't think that a
 

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:35.990
part is to be fair I don't think that a
