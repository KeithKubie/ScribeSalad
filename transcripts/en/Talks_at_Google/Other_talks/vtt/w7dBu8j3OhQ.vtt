CRAIG CORNELIUS: Good afternoon.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.845
My name is Craig Cornelius.

00:00:04.845 --> 00:00:06.470
I work in the
internationalization team

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.270
at Google.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.260
And I'm very pleased to present
our visitors from the Cherokee

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.640
Nation-- Roy Boney, who is
the manager of translation

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.000
services at the Cherokee
Nation, and Jeff Edwards, who

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.750
says that he should be called
a language technologist.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.870
And this is the second visit of
the Cherokee Nation to Google.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.650
And they're going to tell
you about the history

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.920
of the Cherokee writing system
from its origins to today

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.380
and going forward.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.280
Welcome, Roy.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.301
Welcome, Jeff.

00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:40.265
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:43.687 --> 00:00:45.270
JEFF EDWARDS: My
name is Jeff Edwards.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.930
And I work with the
language technology program.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.310
And the Cherokee Nation is doing
some really interesting things.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.410
We're the first tribe to
have our own operating

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.260
system with Windows 8.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.230
We're represented on the iPhone.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.520
But the thing of it is
Cherokees have always

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.375
adapted technology--
not just recently.

00:01:03.375 --> 00:01:04.250
We've always done it.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.708
So I'm going to go through a
little history lesson with you

00:01:06.708 --> 00:01:09.540
guys and show you that
every latest technology that

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.070
came out, the Cherokees
were quick to adapt.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.160
And so this is the guy
that made it all possible.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.100
He's our hero.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.940
He's Sequoyah.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.530
He is the guy credited with
developing the Cherokee writing

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:21.660
system.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.890
Cherokee has 84
syllables right now.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.479
There's some that
have been dropped,

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.395
some that have been
added, and all that stuff.

00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:29.830
But right now, we
have 84 syllables.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.090
And Sequoyah is credited
with developing those.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.510
About two weeks after
Sequoyah developed this,

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.610
90% of all Cherokees were
fluent in reading and writing.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.100
So it's really a very
important part of our history.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.622
And this is a
Sequoyah signature.

00:01:44.622 --> 00:01:46.580
I'd never seen this before
until the other day.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.220
Roy showed me.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.090
And it was really
neat to see that this

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.050
is a treaty that
Sequoyah signed in 1828.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.550
And so we like to show that
just because he did exist.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.462
And Sequoyah was
given this medal.

00:01:59.462 --> 00:02:01.170
If you see a lot of
pictures of Sequoyah,

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.878
there's always something
around his neck.

00:02:02.878 --> 00:02:05.610
And you don't really
know what it says.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.410
Well, this is what
it actually says.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.169
He was given this
medal for basically

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:11.809
inventing the
Cherokee syllabary.

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:13.600
And so that's what's
around Sequoyah's neck

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.990
in all the pictures.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.390
And what gave Sequoyah the
idea to invent the syllabary

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.870
was he witnessed soldiers
writing letters back and forth.

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.060
And so he called those
"talking leaves."

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.240
And so that's what this
says here in Cherokee.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.900
And of course, on the leaf is
Sequoyah's original syllabary,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.620
which we'll show you
a little bit later.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.390
But he wanted the
Cherokees to be

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.400
able to communicate
just like everyone else.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.110
So he developed our
syllabary for us.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.520
This is Sequoyah's
original syllabary.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.410
It looks nothing like the
syllabary we have today.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.230
We'll go into a little
bit of detail why that is.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.910
But this is what he
came up with in 1821.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.954
And like I said, it's really
a very [? script ?] syllabary.

00:02:54.954 --> 00:02:56.870
And the ones we'll show
you here in little bit

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.480
looks nothing like that.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.960
We always point this out, that
there's two characters here--

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.830
we'll go ahead and
highlight both of them.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.530
The first character
that was highlighted

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.497
is actually upside down
by today's standards.

00:03:10.497 --> 00:03:12.080
But at the time, it
was right side up.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.460
So we'll talk about
why that got flipped.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.770
And also, the other
character-- technology

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.150
failed us on that
character until recently.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.540
And so we'll talk about that
a little bit later, as well.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.780
And so they had to do a
handwritten modification

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.030
once they'd changed
Sequoyah's syllabary.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.640
And so you'll see again that
the "do" character is still

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.550
upside down or right
side up, depending

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.630
on what year you're in.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.570
And then there's that
character, as well.

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.030
And this is the reason why
the syllabary had to change.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.190
On the far left is Sequoyah's
original syllabary.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.707
And in the middle is the
handwritten equivalent

00:03:51.707 --> 00:03:52.790
of what they came up with.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.030
And of course, on the right
is a piece of typeset.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.390
They could not make Sequoyah's
handwritten syllabary

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.590
into typeset.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.380
And so if we wanted
to have a newspaper,

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.750
we had to be able to comply.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.010
So that's why the syllabary
changed drastically.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.810
It was to be able to
come up with the typeset.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.090
And so that's the main reason
why the Cherokee syllabary

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.960
looks like it does today, so
we were able to do newspapers.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.880
And this here is the
first thing ever printed.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.570
It's the first five verses
of Genesis with the typeset.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.440
And again, like
I said, we always

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.280
like to highlight that it's kind
of a funny joke that depending

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.310
on where you are
and what year it's

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.440
in if it's upside
down or right side up.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.490
And this is the first edition
of the "Cherokee Phoenix"

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.060
newspaper.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.810
It was printed in 1828.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.550
And the really
neat thing about it

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.490
is, if you can see--
it's kind of blurry--

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.090
but it's in English
and in Cherokee.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.170
And the thing about it was,
was the English was, of course,

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.800
in English.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.730
But the Cherokee was not the
equivalent of the English.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.130
This paper was used
to fight removal

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.640
from North Carolina
on the Trail of Tears.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.410
It was kind of a
political-type piece.

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.610
So we kind of
snuck one in there.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.217
And so if you could
speak Cherokee,

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:02.550
you obviously knew what it said.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.680
And Cherokees-- we were always
printing basically everything.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.810
We had our hymn books,
which is an example here.

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.950
And there's that
"do" character again.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.290
And then here's where it
flipped in around 1836.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.780
And the reason why
they did that is

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.930
because it looked too much like
some of the other characters.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.010
And they didn't want
people to make a mistake.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:27.750
And so they flipped
it over so instead

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.590
of having an upside-down V,
we now had a right-side V.

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.010
And it's like that today.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.290
And here's the character
that got taken away.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.920
It's the "ma" character.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.140
And we recently
worked with Unicode

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.530
and brought this
one back to life.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.366
And I'll go ahead
and read that to you.

00:05:43.366 --> 00:05:45.740
You might not be able to see
it. "That the character 'ma'

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.090
has been omitted, and, as no
type has been cast for it,

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.070
your printers can
only represent it,

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.335
as I perceive they have done, by
breaking the English capital--"

00:05:54.335 --> 00:05:57.770
I think that's a G. And so we
actually lost a character there

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.940
in history.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.030
And this is the
syllabary chart everyone

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.100
is used to seeing today.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.970
This was printed up in 1836.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.930
And of course, there's
that "do" character.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.650
And now, that character there--
what happened with him--

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.630
I don't know if it's
actually proven.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.780
We can't prove it, but
it's a big speculation

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.200
is when it was
typed, since it has

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.040
that little second
bar on it, it has

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.690
a little square-looking
area right here.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.160
And that was an ink blot.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.910
Well, it's not supposed
to look like that.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.130
Well, unfortunately, it
carried over from 1836

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:32.270
until about two
years ago, I guess.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.630
And it always looked that way.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.830
So an ink blot failed
us in the technology.

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.200
And it stayed that way
for a very long time.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.830
And we recently got
that fixed, though.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.710
This is a print of Exodus.

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.542
And so all materials
back in the day

00:06:50.542 --> 00:06:51.750
were all printed in Cherokee.

00:06:54.742 --> 00:06:56.450
And here's just
some more examples

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.150
of printings in Cherokee.

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.970
And they had song books.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.350
That's an arithmetic book.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.820
I don't know the
date on it exactly.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.982
Do you know that for sure?

00:07:06.982 --> 00:07:08.660
1850s, somewhere
around in there.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.880
And so we had math books.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.730
We had almanacs printed
entirely in Cherokee.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.520
The "Cherokee Rose
Buds" was a newspaper

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.130
printed at Northeastern State
University in Tahlequah.

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.050
It actually had a
female seminary.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.610
And they taught Cherokees
as well as whites.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.480
They taught women and men at
the school, at the college.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.900
And so that was really
cutting-edge for the time.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.412
And here's a letter from Abraham
Lincoln to the Cherokees.

00:07:38.412 --> 00:07:40.370
And of course, it is in
the Cherokee syllabary.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.060
So we always thought that
was really neat, from 1863.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.910
So even back then,
they were communicating

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.520
with high levels of
government because we're

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.290
a sovereign nation.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.940
There's the Cherokee
constitution printed up

00:07:52.940 --> 00:07:56.150
entirely in Cherokee in 1875.

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:58.700
And this one always
was really neat.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:04.460
It's a Cherokee shorthand used
by the court reporters in 1890.

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.150
And it was a way of documenting
court cases that went on

00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:13.460
in the Cherokee Nation with
the Cherokee shorthand.

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.550
And then, of course,
along came the telephone.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.630
The Cherokees were first
have a telephone west

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.260
of the Mississippi.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:22.560
And it's always a really
neat story behind that.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.410
They had a line ran from
Tahlequah to Fort Gibson, which

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:27.040
is just a neighboring town.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.050
And they called one another up.

00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:32.640
And the guy instantly
said, it speaks Cherokee.

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:33.850
So they adopted it.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.990
They were able to talk to
each other in Cherokee.

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:38.031
So we always thought that
was a real funny story.

00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:41.650
And so we adopted the telephone.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.550
And of course, we have
several spinoff newspapers.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:46.740
The "Cherokee Phoenix,"
which I showed you earlier,

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.370
is still actually printed today.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:51.330
This is the "Cherokee Advocate."

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.209
And this is the Fort
Gibson "New Era" paper.

00:08:54.209 --> 00:08:56.000
They actually bought
the printing press out

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
but still continue to
print from the Cherokees.

00:09:00.402 --> 00:09:01.860
ROY BONEY: The text
here-- when you

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.360
see Cherokee, that's
a Google font,

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.200
called Noto Sans Cherokee.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.620
Which we're really happy
that Google developed for us.

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.390
But as Jeff was
pointing out, you

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.410
can see that all
through history,

00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:17.380
we always adapted whatever
technology came around.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:21.440
So you saw the previous
slide was a typewriter.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.890
After statehood happened
in 1906 for Oklahoma,

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.730
that basically dissolved
the tribal governments.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.670
And it caused a lot of disarray.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.220
But the language still
continued, the writing

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.331
still continued.

00:09:35.331 --> 00:09:37.330
And through all the decades
of the 20th century,

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.960
we adopted various typewriters
and different things.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:44.250
This picture here is
actually from a typewriter

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.760
at Sequoyah's home
museum, which is

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.750
in a small town near
Sallisaw, Oklahoma.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:51.510
It's the cabin in
which he lived when

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.700
he came to Indian Territory.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:58.275
And this typewriter-- it's
the Hermes 3000 typewriter.

00:09:58.275 --> 00:10:00.045
And if you're a
typewriter enthusiast,

00:10:00.045 --> 00:10:03.980
you know the Hermes
typewriter was pretty popular.

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:08.410
But if you can
imagine typing all 84

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.450
characters on this typewriter.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:12.390
So this is developed.

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:16.980
And what was cool about it is
if you go to this museum today,

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.970
the typewriter's
under a glass case,

00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:22.160
but they'll let you actually
open it up and type on it.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.570
So it still works,
and it's neat to see.

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:26.680
But inside-- this is a
picture of that typewriter

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:27.386
on the inside.

00:10:27.386 --> 00:10:29.385
You can see all the type
heads and how intricate

00:10:29.385 --> 00:10:32.066
it is with the Cherokee
syllables on it.

00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:33.690
I just think that's
really neat to see.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:40.860
So in the middle of
the 20th century,

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:44.670
the Cherokee language became
an endangered language.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.450
And part of the
reason that happened

00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:50.430
was because of technologies
like your radio and TV

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.415
and that types of things
that people didn't go out

00:10:53.415 --> 00:10:54.540
to the communities so much.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.350
They were more in
home and all this.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:11:02.290
And there's also this
concept of relocation,

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:07.920
in which the federal government
took a bunch of native families

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.660
all across the country and
relocated them to big cities.

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:13.490
And the idea was
to get them jobs

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.130
and get them assimilated
to the mass culture.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:19.410
And so a lot of Cherokees
were sent all over the place.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.560
This particular gentleman
named Brian White

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.270
was sent to Chicago.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.220
And while he was
there, he wanted

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:27.450
to keep in touch
with the Cherokee

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.040
people and his language.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.520
So he developed this newsletter
called "The Cherokee Speaker."

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.170
And the reason why
I bring this up

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.330
is because, like I mentioned,
when statehood happened,

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:39.920
it devastated the tribes.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.860
And so we didn't have
a formal organization

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:44.680
kind of running anymore.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.960
But he wanted to continue
printing Cherokee materials.

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.960
Because all the printing
press and all that you saw

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.920
earlier was actually from
the Cherokee Nation itself.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.330
The government was
publishing these things.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.150
So without that
structure anymore,

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:04.460
we needed more independent
people putting out content.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.360
So with this
newsletter, he solicited

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.250
people to raise funds to
develop a new set of type.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:14.170
So in 1962, here it
says that he got $1,000

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.600
to actually make this type.

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.140
So when he got it, he started
making new Cherokee material

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.020
again.

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:23.830
This is a sample of that type.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.190
This is about a squirrel here.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:29.820
But you can see that he
still had this desire

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.760
to create Cherokee content.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.170
The type became very popular.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.470
And more people started making
more and more content with it.

00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.860
This is a page from
a Cherokee primer

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.175
that was made in
1965 using that type.

00:12:43.175 --> 00:12:45.180
And if you look
very closely at it,

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.580
you'll see how this
particular set of type

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:51.700
influenced how fonts and
stuff would look now.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:55.410
In the '70s, the IBM
Selectric typewriter came out.

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.206
And that was very popular.

00:12:57.206 --> 00:13:00.350
The Cherokee Nation
wanted to work with IBM

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.880
to create a Cherokee typewriter
element so they could

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.690
switch out the language with it.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.240
But it proved to
be very expensive.

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.660
There is a gentleman named Scott
Gregory at Cherokee Nation who

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:15.360
was the CFO at the
time of the tribe.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.520
And he told me that
when they did this,

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.200
IBM said they want $30,000
to manufacture these.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.150
And at the time, that was quite
a lot of money for the tribe.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:28.050
So the tribe worked out a
deal with a group in Hawaii

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.340
to actually manufacture
these for $5,000.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.396
So several of these were made.

00:13:33.396 --> 00:13:35.270
And they were distributed
to the communities.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.610
And the communities
took them and started

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.234
making Cherokee
language materials that

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:43.290
helped combat the language
erosion that was happening.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.370
And one of the big
things that occurred

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:49.415
from this particular development
is the 1975 Cherokee dictionary

00:13:49.415 --> 00:13:51.290
by Durbin Feeling.

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:55.109
Durbin is considered
the foremost expert

00:13:55.109 --> 00:13:56.150
on Cherokee language now.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:58.220
He's been working in
the Cherokee language

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.650
for about 40 years,
longer than that.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:02.460
He's devoted his
whole career and life

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.820
to preserving the
Cherokee language.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.590
And this dictionary is
the standard dictionary

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:11.030
which we still use
for the language now.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:15.070
I spoke with-- her
name's Adaline Smith.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:16.656
She was the lady
that actually typeset

00:14:16.656 --> 00:14:17.780
the dictionary at the time.

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:19.545
And she talked about using
that typewriter element

00:14:19.545 --> 00:14:20.820
and having to switch it out.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.640
And you can see it
has the numbers in it.

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:24.890
And that's representing the
tone lengths and all this.

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.300
She said you had to switch out
that for the numbers, and then

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.425
the Cherokee, and then the
English, back and forth.

00:14:29.425 --> 00:14:31.450
And it was quite a task
to typeset this book.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.260
And it's several
hundred pages long.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.157
So you can imagine doing this
in the '70s at a typewriter,

00:14:36.157 --> 00:14:37.240
doing this back and forth.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.360
But they did it.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.340
And we still have it,
and we still use it.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:41.650
Like I said, it's
very important to us.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.150
This is a really
important document.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.995
Around this time,
too, in the 1970s--

00:14:48.995 --> 00:14:53.690
this is dated 1976--
Hermann Zapf, who's

00:14:53.690 --> 00:15:01.610
a very prominent typographer,
was developing a Cherokee font.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:03.800
From what I've
heard about this--

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.690
I'm not sure this is
exactly true-- what

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:07.740
was happening at
this time was when

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.790
Apple was a fledgling company.

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:14.380
And they commissioned
him to develop a font,

00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:16.110
but it never got produced.

00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:18.210
But you can see there was
interest in the Cherokee

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.970
language even at that point.

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.560
It's called Sequoia.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.830
In his book here, the
"Alphabet Stories" book,

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:26.246
if you have that,
you can actually

00:15:26.246 --> 00:15:28.130
see-- he talks more
about in that book.

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:33.370
But about, I guess,
10 years ago,

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:35.690
the University of Wisconsin
took this and actually cast

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:37.564
some of the type in metal.

00:15:37.564 --> 00:15:38.730
The project kind of fizzled.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:41.160
I think they're still
trying to get it completed,

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:44.110
but it's interesting this still
has some interest for people.

00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:51.750
In the 1980s, here's a picture
of Durbin as a younger man.

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:53.850
He worked with a
group out in-- I

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:58.740
think it was Louisiana to
develop the very first Cherokee

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.810
word processing software.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:07.140
And again, the idea was--
the group was a law firm.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:09.000
And Durbin says that
they were working

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.760
on a project about Cherokee
forensics for a case.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.400
And they wanted to record
the testimony of the person.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.470
So they developed this
software to do it.

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:23.290
Here's the first page
of print that they

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.920
made with that particular
piece, that word processor.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:30.850
They presented it to Chief
Wilma Mankiller in 1987.

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:33.330
And it's just a
really cool document.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:35.740
Durbin was kind enough to
share this page with me

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:37.090
from his personal papers.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:44.530
So moving forward a bit
more, in the early '90s,

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.536
that's when the PC
became more popular.

00:16:46.536 --> 00:16:48.160
And it was cheaper
and more affordable.

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:51.710
So more people had it in
their homes than ever before.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:54.260
So people started
making Cherokee fonts.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.310
This is considered probably
the very first Cherokee

00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:01.060
font that was designed
by an actual Cherokee,

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.470
by Franklin McLain.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:04.069
He collaborated with
a gentleman named

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:06.880
Al Webster who was a
computer scientist.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.760
He came down to Cherokee Nation
in Tahlequah, and they met up.

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.844
And he helped design this font.

00:17:11.844 --> 00:17:15.200
It proved to be very popular.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.980
There were several
independent newspapers

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.460
that were published
using this font.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:21.222
And just like any
society, we have

00:17:21.222 --> 00:17:22.430
different political factions.

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:23.346
So they were fighting.

00:17:23.346 --> 00:17:25.790
And it was kind of neat to see
that this was creating more

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.830
literacy in the modern era for
people to discuss and debate.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:34.965
Around the same time, there
was a student at Yale.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:41.801
He was interested in Cherokee
language and different writing

00:17:41.801 --> 00:17:42.300
systems.

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:45.160
So he got a grant to
make a Cherokee font.

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.350
And Jeff kept pointing
out those two characters,

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.620
the upside-down
one and that one.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.240
It's got that little ink
blot on the back of it.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.910
That font here, this
design, that little mistake

00:17:57.910 --> 00:18:00.800
came through since 1836 to now.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.640
And then what happened
is he autotraced

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:06.132
that chart that Jeff
showed you earlier.

00:18:06.132 --> 00:18:07.840
And that came through
with the autotrace.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:15.970
So he donated his word to the
Cherokee Nation and the United

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.410
Kituwa band of
Cherokees, which is

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:19.910
another political
faction of Cherokees.

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:22.170
It's another federally
recognized tribal government,

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.080
but we have the same language.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:28.070
And both governments developed
their own fonts out of it.

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:30.500
They took his work and
modified it slightly.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:32.760
But the Cherokee
Nation font here

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.980
is the one that
really solidified

00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:38.335
its status as the standard font
for a long time after that.

00:18:38.335 --> 00:18:43.600
And you can see that little
blot came through again.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:46.590
And we had this font
since about the year 2000.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:50.740
And until maybe-- I don't
know-- like four years ago,

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:52.810
this is the standard
font that everyone

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:54.170
used to make Cherokee documents.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:55.836
So if you would get
all these documents,

00:18:55.836 --> 00:18:57.880
you'd have that little
printer error in there.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.440
I think it's interesting to see
how technology can have such

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.090
a profound impact on
something like that.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.120
This just shows
how one would type

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.962
using that font, the uppercase
and the lowercase keys

00:19:09.962 --> 00:19:11.545
to access all the
different syllables.

00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:19.180
So Unicode is very
important to us

00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.380
because without it, we
wouldn't have access

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:24.360
to the technology we have now.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:27.980
Back in the mid '90s,
again, Durbin Feeling

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.600
worked with Michael
[? Eberson ?]

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.210
to make the
application of Unicode

00:19:32.210 --> 00:19:34.380
to get the Cherokee
syllabary encoded.

00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:35.860
It took about five years.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:39.751
But then, around the year
2000, Unicode 3.0 came out.

00:19:39.751 --> 00:19:41.500
And that's when the
syllabary was formally

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:42.740
adopted into the system.

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.470
Like a lot of things,
this was new technology.

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:52.300
And it took a while
for people, at least

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.610
in the Cherokee
community, to pick it up.

00:19:54.610 --> 00:19:58.670
So in the year 2003, Apple added
the Cherokee language support

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:04.250
to OS X. When that
occurred, a couple of years

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:09.490
after this, that's when we
discovered what Unicode was.

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:11.740
Like I mentioned, we were
using that other font before

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:13.270
for everything.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.530
And we had all the problems.

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:15.180
We couldn't email.

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:16.805
We couldn't make
websites within those.

00:20:16.805 --> 00:20:18.820
We did an image, all
those kind of thing.

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:24.170
So when we were using Apples at
the Cherokee language immersion

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:27.340
school, which was
established to teach children

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.260
the Cherokee language.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:30.400
So they study
everything in Cherokee,

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.734
from pre-K to sixth grade.

00:20:32.734 --> 00:20:34.900
So it's math, history-- all
the subjects in school's

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:36.150
in Cherokee.

00:20:36.150 --> 00:20:40.350
And you were using
the Macs basically

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.510
to work as graphic designers
to make content for the school.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.794
And one day when I was playing
around in the settings,

00:20:45.794 --> 00:20:46.960
I saw this Cherokee setting.

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:49.080
I'm like, what is doing here?

00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.550
And that's when we figured
out what Unicode was

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:54.370
and how it worked and what
it really meant to us.

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.640
So that was a really
major thing for us

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.450
to understand what that was.

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:03.490
So after we introduced the
laptops to the schools,

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.030
and the students started
using the Apple laptops

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:08.960
so they could do their homework
in the Cherokee language.

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:12.290
So that got us a really good
relationship with Apple.

00:21:12.290 --> 00:21:15.690
And Apple got us in contact
with some people at Facebook.

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:21.410
So in 2009, Facebook
opened up their platform

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:24.600
to crowd-sourced localization.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.510
So if you go to Facebook and
you go through the language

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:29.390
settings and you
change it Cherokee,

00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:31.950
it'll switch your
interface to Cherokee.

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:35.970
And you can actually input
your own translations in it.

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:37.940
And the most
popular translations

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.906
are the ones that go live.

00:21:39.906 --> 00:21:42.030
So that's the processes
that this is going through.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:45.570
We're about-- I
think it's about 50%

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.090
through with this at the moment.

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:50.710
We have different people on
Facebook that are doing this.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:52.100
But it's taking a while.

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.020
And it changes quite a lot, just
like a lot of this stuff does.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.520
So the numbers fluctuate.

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.370
But it's about 50% now.

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:01.730
So our partnership
with Apple continued.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:04.000
They helped us get
things in the schools.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.060
And I said they had the support
for the language on their OS X

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.380
system.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:11.970
So when the iPhone
was released, we

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:14.740
were still working
with them to get

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.330
this technology in the
schools with the assumption

00:22:18.330 --> 00:22:21.160
that the mobile system
was like a smaller

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.370
version of the desktop system.

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:26.140
We said, well, why can't
we have Cherokee on here?

00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:31.790
So in 2010, it was version
4.2, I think-- well,

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:32.545
it's got iOS now.

00:22:32.545 --> 00:22:33.920
But whatever it
was at the time--

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.128
I forget what they called it.

00:22:35.128 --> 00:22:36.890
But they released the update.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:39.520
And it put Cherokee language
support on the system.

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:45.030
So that immediately put our
language on millions of devices

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.140
in the world.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.630
That was the largest
explosion of Cherokee language

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.760
we've ever had.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.800
A major thing that
happened with this, too,

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.570
is that-- at least
for me, personally.

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:00.220
I know other people
had the same response.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:02.600
For the first time
ever-- I had been

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:04.730
active in trying
to learn Cherokee

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:07.310
and to get the
language going again.

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:09.980
But when this
happened, this actually

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.340
gave me the opportunity to
use the language every day,

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.790
because I have it in my pocket.

00:23:13.790 --> 00:23:14.570
I can text.

00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:15.410
It can email.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:16.610
I can surf the web.

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:17.360
I can do all this.

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.131
And I did it every day since.

00:23:19.131 --> 00:23:21.380
And it's really helped me
quite a lot for my language.

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:26.490
Because I come from a family
of fluent Cherokee speakers.

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:28.255
But most people
in my generation--

00:23:28.255 --> 00:23:29.630
we didn't learn
it like we should

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:31.500
have for various reasons.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.710
And this actually was
a major influence on me

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:38.040
to learn it and keep
using it all the time.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:43.320
This is just some
screenshots from the iPad.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.830
Since the iPad runs on the same
system, it's on there, too.

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:49.716
And this was, again, a
remarkable development.

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:56.020
In a lot of communities,
the older generation

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:58.250
don't use a lot of technology.

00:23:58.250 --> 00:24:02.445
And when they saw this, a lot of
them had this look of surprise,

00:24:02.445 --> 00:24:05.900
like what's our language doing
on something this high tech?

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:08.870
And they saw their kids
and grandkids using this.

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:10.790
And they're like, I
got to go get this.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:15.740
So we have these elderly ladies
that have iPads and iPods

00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.400
and iPhones so they
could communicate

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.090
with their grandchildren.

00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:23.380
So I said that was
really quite neat to see.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.930
And then we had to do
the little [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.500
So we had the
calendar and the times

00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:29.535
and all that in Cherokee format.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.910
So that leads us here to Google.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:40.470
In 2011, we worked
with Craig here

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:47.390
to get the Google search
engine interface in Cherokee.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:48.850
Our translators worked on that.

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:50.430
And I think what's really
neat about it, too,

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:52.596
is the virtual keyboard
that was developed for that.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:00.170
In 2012, the Gmail system was
localized in Cherokee, as well.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:03.690
And again, at Northeastern State
University there in Tahlequah,

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:06.310
we have a Cherokee
language degree program.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.330
And the students there--
a lot of universities

00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:10.130
use Gmail as their email system.

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:14.270
So they have access
to that there.

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:17.860
And there is the Noto
Sans Cherokee Google

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.440
font, which I think
is really great.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.080
That was in 2013.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.170
And it's a really nice font.

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:28.050
That's one thing
that we-- we showed

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:31.160
how that one font that we
had for the longest time--

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.090
we used it forever.

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:34.339
And then we had the printer
error in it, and all this.

00:25:34.339 --> 00:25:37.870
So it's nice to see that our
language is getting out there.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:39.860
And there are more
typographers out there

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:42.060
that are designing
Cherokee fonts now.

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.120
Even more Cherokees
are designing fonts,

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.520
too, but it's nice to see
this explosion of font design

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.020
for us.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.680
Just this year,
the Cherokee Nation

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.020
put out a Cherokee speakers
playlist on YouTube.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.200
So we created a lot
of digital content.

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.930
We record a lot of
Cherokee speakers

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:04.590
and cultural activities.

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:06.144
And we put it on
this playlist here.

00:26:06.144 --> 00:26:08.310
So you can go there to the
Cherokee Nation's YouTube

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:10.719
channel and watch
the various videos

00:26:10.719 --> 00:26:12.260
that we have about
Cherokee language.

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:20.150
All this also led to
partnerships with Microsoft.

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:23.885
So in 2012, we released
the Windows 8 localization

00:26:23.885 --> 00:26:27.370
in Cherokee, which is just
the language interface pack.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:29.290
So if you go to your
settings in Windows 8

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.440
and download the
interface pack, it'll

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:36.520
turn your interface
in the syllabary.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.160
As part of this
project, too, Microsoft

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.600
developed the UI font
for the Cherokee language

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.120
called Cadugi.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:47.020
In Cherokee, the
word "cadugi" talks

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.350
about-- it's meaning
working together

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:51.140
or the idea of community.

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:54.210
The word "skadugi" in Cherokee
actually means community.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:56.950
So you can see how that word
is actually part of that.

00:26:56.950 --> 00:27:00.370
And the reason why it was
named that is the idea here

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:02.310
with this particular
font is if there

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:05.715
are any other native
languages that

00:27:05.715 --> 00:27:08.590
are wanting to do this
process with Microsoft.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:12.480
And if they have any special
glyphs in their writing system,

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.750
it'll be housed in
this particular font.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:16.760
So in the future,
other native languages

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.510
will be using this font if
they do this same localization

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:22.180
process.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:26.104
Microsoft also took
all the translations

00:27:26.104 --> 00:27:28.520
and put it on their website
here at their language portal.

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.841
So for a lot of our people
that are learning Cherokee

00:27:31.841 --> 00:27:33.340
and they're using
this product, they

00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:35.806
can actually go here
and search for what

00:27:35.806 --> 00:27:36.930
all those translations say.

00:27:36.930 --> 00:27:38.380
And it kind tells
them what it is.

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.210
So part of this process,
as you may know,

00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:48.970
is localizing content is
an interesting process.

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:51.350
You get to see
how the people see

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:54.910
the world and their language
and how they translate things.

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:57.750
Here are just a few samples.

00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:01.310
Email is [CHEROKEE], which
means lighting paper.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:03.827
And the idea is it's paper,
and it's really fast.

00:28:03.827 --> 00:28:05.660
So I think that's kind
of a neat idea of how

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.280
people see the technology.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.930
Junk mail is [CHEROKEE].

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:16.920
And it just means something
bad or something unpleasant.

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:21.020
So a lot of times, if you stub
your toe, you say, [CHEROKEE],

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.070
like, ow, that hurt.

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:24.840
That's kind of what
that's coming from.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.970
So it shows you how
people see junk mail.

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:27.840
No one likes it.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.350
The word to follow, like to
follow someone on Facebook

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:39.420
or whatever-- [CHEROKEE]
is talking about you're

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:42.360
actually shadowing somebody,
rather than following them.

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.447
You're actually more
attached to them.

00:28:44.447 --> 00:28:46.030
So again, these are
just a few samples

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:50.550
so you can see how the Cherokee
language sees the world a bit

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:51.220
differently.

00:28:51.220 --> 00:28:52.650
And every language is this way.

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:54.650
When you're localizing
content, you're

00:28:54.650 --> 00:28:57.030
actually making content
for that user base.

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.530
And you can see how
they approach the world.

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:06.100
An interesting
aspect of Cherokee

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.960
is how the language talks
about these concepts

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:13.810
of-- other languages, too, but--
you, me, his, her, their, our.

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:18.210
We have to change the
prefix of the word that

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:20.140
denotes the pronoun.

00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:24.430
Like file-- "your
file" is [CHEROKEE],

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:29.240
versus "her file" is [CHEROKEE].

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.890
It's a slight
difference, but you're

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.179
denoting who you're
talking about.

00:29:33.179 --> 00:29:34.720
And all these concepts
come into play

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:36.370
as part of this
localization process.

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:42.670
Just this year, we
released Office Online

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.880
in the Cherokee syllabary.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.580
So if you go to onedrive.com,
with your Microsoft account,

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:51.350
you can login and have access
to Word, PowerPoint, and Excel

00:29:51.350 --> 00:29:54.140
in the Cherokee language.

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:58.440
This is one of the most popular
piece of software in the world.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.470
So it's neat to see the Cherokee
language in this setting.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:08.950
So that brings me
to new developments

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:11.220
and what we're
working on right now.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:15.020
We currently have
a Unicode proposal

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.980
in the pipeline to add
casing to Cherokee.

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.580
We're going to have
uppercase and lowercase.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:23.320
And historically,
we've always had it.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:25.860
It's just when the initial
application to Unicode

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:29.840
was put in in the mid '90s,
that, for whatever reason,

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.410
was not part of the application.

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:34.690
So the language itself
was encoded as just

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:37.250
it wasn't uppercase
or lowercase.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.660
But you can see here-- this
is from the Gospel of John

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:44.250
in 1860, with the capital
letters highlighted.

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:45.980
In the math book we
showed you earlier,

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:50.959
you can see there's some capital
letters in Cherokee there.

00:30:50.959 --> 00:30:52.500
In the handwriting,
too, we've always

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.880
had uppercase and
lowercase in it.

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.280
This here is actually
a modern test,

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:04.280
playing with fonts in uppercase
and lowercase and keyboard

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:04.880
layouts.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:08.935
And so this is a very early
test of Cherokee bicameral text.

00:31:11.690 --> 00:31:14.550
So like I said, the
current Cherokee text

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:18.550
is actually considered caseless.

00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:22.890
I don't know how Unicode's
going to eventually decide

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:23.630
how this will be.

00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:28.210
But the latest update I had,
this is how they explained it.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:31.010
And I'm not a Unicode
encoder or whatever.

00:31:31.010 --> 00:31:32.340
So this is kind of new to me.

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:37.160
But the basic suggestion is
to make the existing Cherokee

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.630
characters as uppercase.

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.430
So when they add
this new lowercase,

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:42.100
that'll be the new range.

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:46.650
But I don't know if that's how
it's going to pan out or not.

00:31:46.650 --> 00:31:47.250
We'll see.

00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:48.708
Like I said, it's
still in process.

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:56.430
This here is interesting to
me to see-- Cherokee Braille.

00:31:56.430 --> 00:32:01.890
This is actually a really,
really recent new thing here.

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:04.420
Just this morning I got
a phone call about it.

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:09.245
But what happened is this group
called the Commonwealth Braille

00:32:09.245 --> 00:32:12.780
and Talking Book Cooperative
in British Columbia contacted

00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:14.390
the Cherokee Nation.

00:32:14.390 --> 00:32:18.930
And they said that what they
do is they go through Unicode.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:20.590
And all the languages
that are encoded

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:23.120
that don't have a Braille
version, they make it.

00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.350
So they got to Cherokee.

00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:25.831
And they said,
well, we want to do

00:32:25.831 --> 00:32:27.080
a Cherokee version of Braille.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.710
And this is what
they came up with.

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:30.890
And we were actually
just the other day

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:34.610
looking for someone that's
familiar with Braille

00:32:34.610 --> 00:32:37.340
and Cherokee to be able to
actually test it and see

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:39.060
if it makes sense.

00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.800
And just this morning,
I got a phone call

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:44.020
from one of my bosses
saying, we found somebody.

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.700
So this is still in process.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:48.610
But you can see that our
language is still evolving.

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:50.980
We're still trying to get
in every format that we can.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.824
This is something that's
very important to us.

00:32:53.824 --> 00:32:55.240
There's quite a
lot of people that

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.760
are starting to
tweet in Cherokee.

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:59.589
It's still a very small group.

00:32:59.589 --> 00:33:01.630
But there's a website
called indigenoustweets.com

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:05.042
that tracks indigenous languages
and how much of they're

00:33:05.042 --> 00:33:05.625
being tweeted.

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:13.270
As I mentioned to
Craig earlier, when

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:17.590
we started collaborating with
Google, it was about 2010.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:21.210
If you were to do a
search for [CHEROKEE]--

00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:23.172
that's the word for
Cherokee there--

00:33:23.172 --> 00:33:26.250
there were only like a couple
thousand results when you would

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:27.360
search for it.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.060
This is from this morning.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:31.600
There's over 3
million results now.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.960
So in that four-year
time span, the presence

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.660
of the Cherokee language
online has exploded.

00:33:37.660 --> 00:33:41.060
And the idea is to keep it going
because we want our language

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:41.600
to continue.

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:42.600
We want it to thrive.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.410
And using technology
has been one

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:49.090
of the major tools in which
this is happening for us.

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:51.480
This is the point where
I might rib you a bit.

00:33:55.594 --> 00:33:57.510
As part of this process,
the Cherokee language

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:00.560
is on most every major
piece of technology

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.430
you want to use now
except the Android system.

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:07.850
But what's interesting about
that is if you go to the store,

00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:09.850
there are developers out
there that are actually

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:13.130
making Cherokee language
keyboards already.

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:15.210
The problem with
it is while you're

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:16.826
inside the keyboard
or the app itself,

00:34:16.826 --> 00:34:17.909
you will see the language.

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:19.719
But once you go
outside of it, you'll

00:34:19.719 --> 00:34:21.179
see the [INAUDIBLE]
or the blocks.

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:23.210
So you can see that
in this screenshot

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:27.449
here from the Google Play
Store for this plug-in here.

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:29.909
This is how the keyboard
looks currently.

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:34.040
Because I took this this
morning off my Droid tablet.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:34.989
I installed that.

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:36.989
And you can see there's
no Cherokee showing up

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:39.190
on the device.

00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:40.973
And then once you
actually enable it,

00:34:40.973 --> 00:34:42.389
it shows up on the
keyboard there.

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:45.000
But once you get
outside the app again,

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.020
you can see it's not showing up
correctly on the device itself.

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:51.370
So that something that we would
like to see someday, maybe

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:54.360
Cherokee support on the Droid.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.380
So we want to go
from this to this.

00:34:57.380 --> 00:35:02.222
And I have a rooted Droid that
I did and installed it in that.

00:35:02.222 --> 00:35:04.680
I've done several people in
the community's phones this way

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:05.940
that want Cherokee on it.

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.970
But the average
person isn't going

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:09.632
to sit there and
root their device

00:35:09.632 --> 00:35:11.090
and install this
font and all this.

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:13.270
So it's kind of something
that we'd really

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:16.330
like to see happen for
the Cherokee language,

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:19.810
that Cherokee
support on the Droid.

00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:22.200
But this brings
it all back around

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:24.970
to kind of where we started.

00:35:24.970 --> 00:35:28.260
This is a screenshot of
the "Cherokee Phoenix" now.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:29.630
It's still being published.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:31.165
It's online.

00:35:31.165 --> 00:35:32.540
And there's also
a paper version.

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:34.510
That's still in English
and in Cherokee.

00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:37.210
So you can see that, as a
people, we still have it.

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:38.470
We still use it.

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:42.340
And it's very important
to us to keep it going.

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:47.240
We're a small group of--
it's a small community.

00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.910
We don't have
millions of people.

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:51.730
We don't have
millions of speakers.

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:55.190
But still, it's a very important
part of who we are as people.

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:58.060
With that, I'll wrap
up here and open it

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:00.620
to any questions you may have.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:03.080
AUDIENCE: It was really
interesting to see

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.210
the various technological
words like junk mail

00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:08.440
and all these
things that show up

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.970
in the Cherokee
version of Gmail.

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:13.620
Did those words exist
organically in the community

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.210
before this
localization took place?

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:17.860
Or were they invented
specifically for this?

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:18.840
ROY BONEY: Not really.

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.990
Email was something that was
kind of existing already.

00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:24.290
But stuff like junk
mail-- no, that

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:26.820
had to be invented for
all these projects.

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.730
AUDIENCE: I noticed in
several different slides,

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:33.590
it looked like the syllabary
was organized in different ways

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:35.060
throughout its history.

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:38.730
I was curious-- how
is it organized today?

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:42.860
I understand that each
grapheme represents

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.730
a morpheme itself, one syllable.

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:51.690
So are they organized with a
semantic theme in one line?

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:54.465
Or are they organized by sound?

00:36:54.465 --> 00:36:56.090
ROY BONEY: They're
organized by sound--

00:36:56.090 --> 00:37:00.220
let me pull up that chart here.

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:02.750
They call it Sequoyah's
original arrangement.

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:07.086
And no one knows exactly what
the thinking was behind it,

00:37:07.086 --> 00:37:08.710
because he didn't
document his process.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:12.840
But as Jeff mentioned, when
the syllabary was formally

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:16.330
adopted by the
Cherokee Nation in 1821

00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:18.530
and the community
started learning it,

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:21.190
within a really
short amount of time,

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:24.181
people became literate using
this language, this writing

00:37:24.181 --> 00:37:24.680
system.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.250
So this was his layout.

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:30.390
And however he did it,
for whatever reason,

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:32.180
people that were
in that time that

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.070
spoke Cherokee picked
it up really fast.

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.230
And the way it
goes, the sounds are

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:41.670
"ay," "ah," "lah," "gee,"
"nah," "wah," "way," "wee."

00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:45.860
But it doesn't follow any--
it's not the English format,

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:46.750
I guess.

00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:49.880
Because the modern version
of how arranged now,

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:54.250
it actually follows kind of an
English alphabetical setting.

00:37:54.250 --> 00:37:55.539
So the top row is the vowels.

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:57.580
You have the "ah," "ay,"
"ee," "oh," "ooh," "uh."

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:00.080
But down the side, it
goes-- you can see a G.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:01.477
So it goes "gah," "hah," "lah."

00:38:01.477 --> 00:38:05.930
It's kind of following that
English alphabetical way.

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:08.020
And the reason this
happened is actually

00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:11.850
a missionary that
did this arrangement.

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:13.870
And that's the one
that kind of stuck.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:15.275
AUDIENCE: Looks like Japanese.

00:38:15.275 --> 00:38:16.275
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:38:16.275 --> 00:38:18.240
It does.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.180
ROY BONEY: One back there or--

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:23.425
AUDIENCE: Did syllable
for said, the one that

00:38:23.425 --> 00:38:28.050
looks very much like the
Latin four, the digit 4.

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:31.230
As we go forward-- in your
slides, I saw the kind of serif

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:33.530
at the end, that
it even disappears.

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:37.391
It almost looks like a
normal 4 in your later text.

00:38:37.391 --> 00:38:38.890
How do you typically
distinguish it?

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:42.470
Just assume that the reader
would know from the context?

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:46.250
ROY BONEY: Yeah, a lot
of it is context based.

00:38:46.250 --> 00:38:48.470
Anyone that's fluent in the
language will be writing.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:52.110
And they'll know what that's
supposed to be saying.

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:55.506
The Cadugi font from
Microsoft-- let's

00:38:55.506 --> 00:39:00.910
see if I can find it
here-- is actually,

00:39:00.910 --> 00:39:04.231
at least in the modern era here.

00:39:04.231 --> 00:39:05.730
This is actually
the first font that

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:08.880
was actually designed
and vetted in conjunction

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:11.440
with the Cherokee Nation itself.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.810
All those other ones
were-- the fonts,

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:17.420
they were created independently.

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:21.270
But this one, actually the
designers from Microsoft--

00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:23.800
we'd have conference calls
with the translation department

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.300
and other members of the
Cherokee language community.

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.642
And they would actually
go through this process.

00:39:28.642 --> 00:39:30.100
And this is what
they came up with.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:33.960
This is considered
the base shapes

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.840
of what the syllables would be.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.480
So if you follow
this format here,

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.050
you'd get pretty close of
what most Cherokees would

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:46.020
understand, the bare
minimum, without the serifs.

00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:49.140
AUDIENCE: In the beginning
of the first slides,

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.660
it was one handwritten.

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:56.590
And I think it had some vertical
squiggle lines between words.

00:39:56.590 --> 00:39:58.600
So what's the status
today with punctuation?

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:02.690
Use just Latin punctuation
or no punctuation at all?

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:05.110
ROY BONEY: Yeah, it's just
the Latin punctuation.

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:08.530
This here actually
shows the original

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:11.310
and then how the modern
one kind of came out.

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:15.190
So if you see the ones
that look like a G--

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:17.970
AUDIENCE: And so the vertical
squiggly line have any meaning?

00:40:17.970 --> 00:40:19.670
Is that a space between words?

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:21.045
ROY BONEY: That's
just separating

00:40:21.045 --> 00:40:21.975
each of the syllables.

00:40:21.975 --> 00:40:23.410
So there's one, and there's one.

00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:24.320
That's all that is.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.030
You're just separating.

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:26.500
But as far as
punctuation goes, we

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:30.106
don't have any special
punctuation at all.

00:40:30.106 --> 00:40:32.355
AUDIENCE: So use Latin one,
or you don't use anything?

00:40:32.355 --> 00:40:33.605
ROY BONEY: Yeah, we use Latin.

00:40:33.605 --> 00:40:37.140
There are some people that
don't use punctuation.

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.050
They just go.

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:42.987
But most people use the
English punctuation.

00:40:42.987 --> 00:40:44.820
JEFF EDWARDS: Most
recently, we brought back

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:46.810
the Cherokee number system.

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:47.780
ROY BONEY: Oh, yeah.

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:52.740
Sequoyah developed a
Cherokee number system,

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.700
which never really took off.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:57.420
But we have an individual
named John Ross.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:00.210
He's a translation specialist
at Cherokee Nation.

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:03.820
And he sat down and studied
the Cherokee number system.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:06.400
And he deciphered how
it actually works.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.735
And he has this whole system.

00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:13.070
When Sequoyah made it,
he didn't have a zero.

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:15.625
So when John took it and
[? invented ?] the zero.

00:41:15.625 --> 00:41:16.980
And it just all works.

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:19.680
So now it's kind of coming back.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.870
JEFF EDWARDS: I think
he's up to a trillion now,

00:41:21.870 --> 00:41:22.502
I think is what he's up to.

00:41:22.502 --> 00:41:23.300
He's really far into it.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:25.591
ROY BONEY: He just keeps
adding numbers and writing it.

00:41:25.591 --> 00:41:27.510
So it's kind of neat to see.

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:29.900
AUDIENCE: So with the
focus to get the language

00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:32.740
into modern technology--
is it solely

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.590
to just get the language there?

00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:39.020
Or is it to use the other
features such as proofreading

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.440
and spell checking
and keyboard swipes

00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.879
and stuff along those lines?

00:41:43.879 --> 00:41:45.420
ROY BONEY: I'd love
to have all that.

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:47.720
Part of the stuff
with Microsoft--

00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:49.930
we actually have a spell
check dictionary now.

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:51.930
And all that's
kind of developing.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:54.090
It's not as robust
as other languages,

00:41:54.090 --> 00:41:58.180
but that part of the technology
is starting to happen now.

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:02.630
Like on iOS, there's a
spell check dictionary

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:03.740
in there and all that.

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:07.160
And so it's slowly happening,
but we'd like to see of it.

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.625
And it has the
same problems, too,

00:42:08.625 --> 00:42:09.750
when you get autocorrected.

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:11.375
You're like, I didn't
mean to say that.

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:17.460
AUDIENCE: There are
significantly more

00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:18.896
symbols in Cherokee
that in Latin.

00:42:18.896 --> 00:42:21.146
If I remember right, you
said 84, something like that?

00:42:21.146 --> 00:42:22.450
ROY BONEY: 84, yeah.

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:24.241
AUDIENCE: So it was
very interesting to see

00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:26.810
in the different
formats through history

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:28.810
that you went through how
those are accommodated

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:30.560
on the keyboards that existed.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:34.210
It looked like a lot of
times it was using the Shift

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:36.890
or adding rows or
something like that.

00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:44.960
So I was just curious
what the best system is.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:49.150
Or if that seems to be
a significant impediment

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:54.100
for people in the past,
and if it slows down

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:56.050
typing to have to use
shifting all the time.

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:59.394
Or if there's something that's
being done in these more

00:42:59.394 --> 00:43:00.810
current layouts
where they're less

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:03.970
constrained by the
physical device.

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:06.826
What's the best way
that you've found

00:43:06.826 --> 00:43:08.200
that's most
convenient for people

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:12.100
who are trying to
write fluently?

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:15.370
JEFF EDWARDS: The way it started
out was there's 84 characters.

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:18.160
And so all punctuation is
gone from this typewriter.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.490
We didn't have room for it.

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:21.670
And so you did the Shift key.

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:23.890
There's a few on there,
commas and stuff like that.

00:43:23.890 --> 00:43:26.810
But most of the numbers
and stuff are gone.

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:29.350
And you use that Shift
key to toggle it.

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:32.775
And that basically carried
over into the modern times.

00:43:32.775 --> 00:43:34.150
And that's actually
how I learned

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:36.470
how to start typing, with
this keyboard layout.

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:39.170
And I'm not going to lie to
you-- at first, remembering

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:42.580
where 84 keys are when you
have to shift is really hard.

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:44.190
But if you use it
every day, like I

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:48.500
did, for about 10 hours a day,
you get really fast at it.

00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:51.070
But once we started
doing Unicode,

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:53.940
we got our phonetic keyboard,
which allowed us to type

00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:57.000
the "tsa" instead of having
to hold the Shift key,

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.430
so that shifting stuff
no longer mattered.

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:01.750
We were just able to type
our phonetic sounds--

00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:04.800
which I don't know if we
have any of those there.

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.430
But you could type that way.

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:09.500
And so I can go
faster in Cherokee

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.227
than I can in English
now, just because

00:44:11.227 --> 00:44:12.310
of that phonetic keyboard.

00:44:12.310 --> 00:44:15.020
So that helped tremendously.

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:17.570
ROY BONEY: On the
iPhone or iOS keyboard,

00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:20.670
it has a sort of
phonetic typing system.

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:23.950
So if you're familiar with that
big chart that we keep showing,

00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:26.301
here's the vowels, the "ah,"
"ay," "ee," "oh," "ooh,"

00:44:26.301 --> 00:44:26.800
and "uh."

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.920
If you want to type
the sound "gee,"

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:32.480
you would type "ga" plus "ee,"
and it switches to "gee."

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:35.260
And also, if you hold down the
key, the whole row pops up.

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:38.760
But it's based on that
phonetic idea of typing.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:43.050
And it works really well
for the touchscreen devices.

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:46.190
Microsoft followed
a similar format.

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:48.986
Slightly different, but
if you have Windows 8

00:44:48.986 --> 00:44:50.610
and you have a
touchscreen device, when

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:51.984
you enable the
phonetic keyboard,

00:44:51.984 --> 00:44:54.120
it goes to this touchscreen.

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.900
And it's still a
little bit tricky.

00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:58.150
I think this is probably the
best touchscreen keyboard

00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:59.450
that we've seen so far.

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:02.600
But Microsoft's just try to do
something different, I guess,

00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.170
because the competition,
or whatever.

00:45:04.170 --> 00:45:06.750
But it still works.

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:09.800
It is based off of
that phonetic idea

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.370
of how you would
type a language.

00:45:12.370 --> 00:45:14.292
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if you managed--

00:45:14.292 --> 00:45:16.250
I guess you have a lot
of historical documents,

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:18.791
since the press has been using
this language for a long time.

00:45:18.791 --> 00:45:20.970
Have you been able to
collaborate with anybody

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:24.730
to get any OCR technology so
you can scan these documents

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:29.437
and import them into a
Unicode searchable index?

00:45:29.437 --> 00:45:31.270
ROY BONEY: There's been
a little bit of work

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:33.780
here at Google with
the [? tesseract ?]

00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:36.620
group that does the OCR.

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:38.830
Not a lot has been done with it.

00:45:38.830 --> 00:45:42.370
Part of the issue that
we've had with it is it's

00:45:42.370 --> 00:45:44.160
not really user friendly.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.932
For us, our
community to take it,

00:45:45.932 --> 00:45:47.390
running commands
and all that stuff

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:49.350
is not something most
people know how to do.

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:52.104
So we haven't been able to
feed a lot of data into it.

00:45:52.104 --> 00:45:53.770
But that's the only
one I know of that's

00:45:53.770 --> 00:45:57.430
been actually done so far,

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:00.000
AUDIENCE: So it's
more just managing

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.370
the process of
running the software

00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:04.867
and getting the data into it.

00:46:04.867 --> 00:46:06.950
CRAIG CORNELIUS: To answer
that a little bit more,

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:09.020
there is a group in
the research building

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:12.920
that is doing multilingual OCR.

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:14.902
And they've worked with
the Cherokee a bit,

00:46:14.902 --> 00:46:16.610
but we haven't done
a lot of testing yet.

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:19.000
We'd like to do it, but
getting the scanning--

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.750
there are books in the
Cherokee libraries,

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:22.249
for example, that
we'd like to scan.

00:46:22.249 --> 00:46:25.720
But unfortunately, the number of
books that have been suggested

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:26.950
is in the hundreds.

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:30.430
And Google scanning works
well 10,000 books and above.

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:35.320
So getting organizational
and logistics is the harder

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.780
part than the actual
OCR, I believe.

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:41.160
But we'd love to work on
some of those projects, too.

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.240
AUDIENCE: So I
guess I'm interested

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:47.710
in the political shift that took
place in the Cherokee Nation.

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:50.820
Because it almost seems
like when Sequoyah developed

00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:53.420
the syllabary, it
was pointedly very

00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:55.920
different from Latin
script and sort of flew

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:59.500
in the face of the perceived
dominant culture of the time.

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:02.010
But now Cherokee
survival depends,

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:05.990
it seems from what you two
are saying, on the integration

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:08.520
with this mobile technology.

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:14.010
And all of these working
together to keep it alive.

00:47:14.010 --> 00:47:16.290
So at what point--
was there an event

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:20.480
or was there a series of events
or splits in Cherokee history

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:24.987
over the question of whether
to isolate or to adapt

00:47:24.987 --> 00:47:25.570
and integrate?

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:30.540
ROY BONEY: There's a
long history there.

00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:33.130
Actually, when Sequoyah was
developing the writing system

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:35.746
itself, he had a
lot of resistance.

00:47:35.746 --> 00:47:37.870
There were Cherokees that
said, we don't need that.

00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:40.890
That's the invader technology.

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:43.050
Or not technology,
but that's their way.

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:45.780
We don't need that.

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:48.700
He actually worked on it over
the course of about 10 years.

00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:51.332
And then halfway through
it, his work was destroyed.

00:47:51.332 --> 00:47:53.790
Some Cherokees actually burned
down his cabin with his work

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:55.520
inside, said, we
don't need this.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.560
But he started again.

00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:00.110
They say that he had even
more characters, like 100

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:00.980
or something in it.

00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:03.270
And when that happened,
he modified it again

00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:04.820
and came up with
what we have now.

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:10.180
But after it was adopted in
the 1820s, in this era in 1820s

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:12.360
is when the removal
policy was being

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:14.580
debated in Washington, DC.

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:17.300
And in the 1830s, when
the policy was passed--

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:20.340
and when that was passed,
there were factions.

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:22.490
There were Cherokees
that said, we just

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:24.915
need to give in and
just adapt and adopt

00:48:24.915 --> 00:48:27.054
into the mainstream society.

00:48:27.054 --> 00:48:28.220
And some said, no, we don't.

00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:29.350
And they kept fighting.

00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:30.630
And they kept resisting.

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:32.860
And they kept the writing
system as part of it.

00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.420
Because a big part
of the content that

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:38.785
exists from that era
still is a lot of it

00:48:38.785 --> 00:48:41.000
was traditional knowledge
and traditional medicine

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.950
that was written in
the Cherokee language.

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:48.330
And over the years, as the
language itself diminished

00:48:48.330 --> 00:48:51.630
in the number of
fluent speakers,

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:55.060
the writing system
became almost sacred.

00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:56.435
And so some people
would say, you

00:48:56.435 --> 00:48:58.976
don't need to learn that because
that's sacred knowledge only

00:48:58.976 --> 00:49:01.550
reserved for certain people
that are supposed to know this.

00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:04.730
And so as technology changed,
and in the 20th century,

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:08.300
when people started seeing
that more people are losing

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.500
the language, the idea
changed, like, well,

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:12.520
we need to stop
thinking this way

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:14.890
and adapt new ways of
communicating and using it

00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:15.820
still.

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:18.910
And so that tension
is still around.

00:49:18.910 --> 00:49:21.250
There are people that
don't like this still,

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:23.390
what we're doing
with technology.

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:28.219
But for the most
part, it's positive.

00:49:28.219 --> 00:49:30.510
We say this quite a lot when
we do these presentations.

00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:33.530
There was a person
that said, talking

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:36.035
about putting the language
out there online and stuff.

00:49:36.035 --> 00:49:38.700
They thought, well, what
if someone out there

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.419
tries to became a
Cherokee medicine man,

00:49:41.419 --> 00:49:42.460
and they're not Cherokee?

00:49:42.460 --> 00:49:43.501
And they don't know this.

00:49:43.501 --> 00:49:45.130
They weren't raised this way.

00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:47.180
And then, well,
the answer is, you

00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.170
don't become a doctor
by googling stuff.

00:49:49.170 --> 00:49:52.536
You have to actually go be
trained formally to do this.

00:49:52.536 --> 00:49:54.160
So as I said, there
is a tension there.

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.560
And we're still dealing
with that change.

00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.170
But using technology has been
a big step forward for us.

00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:02.690
AUDIENCE: Since this is
going to go on YouTube,

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:06.200
I just actually want to make an
announcement regarding Unicode.

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.002
Actually, just last
month around this time,

00:50:09.002 --> 00:50:10.335
Unicode technical committee met.

00:50:10.335 --> 00:50:14.800
I actually represent Google to
that committee, as some others.

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:19.000
So we actually approved the
Cherokee lowercase letters,

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:19.500
basically.

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:21.563
So they will be in
Unicode 8, which

00:50:21.563 --> 00:50:24.430
will be released next
year around this time.

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:26.830
And the characters
are also safe to use.

00:50:26.830 --> 00:50:28.690
So we've also frozen
the code points.

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:32.350
So you can basically-- if you
figure out with the technology

00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:35.709
partners you have, you can
sort it into characters today.

00:50:35.709 --> 00:50:37.500
So they are approved,
and they should work.

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:39.045
And [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:39.045 --> 00:50:41.547
ROY BONEY: That's good news.

00:50:41.547 --> 00:50:42.880
All right, that's great to hear.

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.340
CRAIG CORNELIUS: Well,
all good things must end.

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:48.120
I would like us all to thank
them for the presentation.

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.870
[APPLAUSE]
