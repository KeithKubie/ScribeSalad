00:00:00.314 --> 00:00:04.790
So here we have our lovely number
line with 0 clearly marked,

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.090
marks to indicate scale and
a positive and negative direction.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.964
But what do the arrows at the ends mean?

00:00:12.964 --> 00:00:17.290
How far do you think these number
lines extend on either end?

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.860
Do they extend to the arrows
as far as we want them to?

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.840
To +100 on the right and
-100 on the left?

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.790
Or do they extend on forever?

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.854
Please select one.

00:00:30.854 --> 00:00:32.799
