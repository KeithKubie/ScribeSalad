00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.100
- Hey everyone I hope you're having

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.750
an amazing day it's Mark Wiens,

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.880
I'm in Sapporo on the island
of Hokkaido in northern Japan.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.890
And of course Japan is known
for seafood but Hokkaido

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.720
is known within Japan for seafood.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.830
So this morning we are
going to the Sapporo

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.870
fish market, the main market.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.760
We're gonna buy a bunch of
seafood, hopefully eat some crab.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.160
Crab is very well known
in Hokkaido as well,

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.160
especially in the winter time
and yeah it is a cold morning

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.670
but I am ready to eat some seafood

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.437
and we're walking to the market right now.

00:00:32.437 --> 00:00:35.354
(soft house music)

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:50.760
It's like a 10 minute walk
from the subway station

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.550
but this is the beginning
of the outer market.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.400
There's a couple of very very
famous restaurants, seafood

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.440
restaurants, Hokkaido seafood
restaurants in this area.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.190
It's just the morning now but already

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.703
starting to get kinda busy.

00:01:05.596 --> 00:01:08.867
♪ Yeah I don't want, she got a point ♪

00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:12.320
- Oh, it's getting really
cold but to my understanding

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.990
the whole sale market is, it's actually

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.010
on the other side of the road,

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.630
but that's not really open
to the public and that really

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.290
takes place early in the
morning or even late at night.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.540
But so then right now
we're in the outer market,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.650
which is the retail part of the market.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.450
Where you can come, where
you can shop for food,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.230
where you can shop for
fish and seafood and crabs.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.150
And then they also have
restaurants here as well.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.200
All of a sudden it's starting to snow.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.722
Okay I think we need to eat a,
we need to order a crab ASAP.

00:01:41.722 --> 00:01:44.555
(water splashing)

00:01:47.717 --> 00:01:50.300
- Do you have Hanasaki also?
- Hanasaki!

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.450
- That one is Hanasaki.
- Hanasaki.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.060
- [Mark] What is the season
now, Hanasaki's season?

00:01:56.686 --> 00:02:00.728
- Hanasaki.
- Oh this one is Hanasaki.

00:02:00.728 --> 00:02:05.061
- [Mark] Hanasaki.

00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:08.583
- One kilo, one kilo.
- 1.7 kilos.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.223
Okay.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.103
Yeah like that one, that
one is like three kilo?

00:02:22.938 --> 00:02:25.207
- Big size.
- Big size.

00:02:31.174 --> 00:02:32.588
- Okay, yeah.
- Okay?

00:02:32.588 --> 00:02:35.005
- [Mark] How many kilo is it?

00:02:37.668 --> 00:02:41.585
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.323
- 34,000.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.363
- Steam, grill.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.000
Hot, hot okay.
- All steam grilled?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.833
- Uh-hum.
- Okay.

00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:01.240
(woman speaking in foreign language)

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.397
Putting on the yellow gloves.

00:03:02.397 --> 00:03:03.230
- [Woman] You okay?

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.980
- [Mark] I think so, thank you.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.860
I don't like this, oh okay.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.180
I couldn't decide between the
King crab and Hanasaki crab

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.457
so we decided to get them both.

00:03:13.457 --> 00:03:16.374
(soft house music)

00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:19.227
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:19.227 --> 00:03:21.412
(laughing)

00:03:21.412 --> 00:03:25.329
(speaking in foreign language)

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.998
- [Mark] Oh this is the
Hanasaki boiled yeah?

00:03:29.998 --> 00:03:32.071
- Hanasaki boiled, yeah.

00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:36.321
(all speaking in foreign language)

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:45.380
- My lens is all fogging up,

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.900
but the two different crabs the Hanasaki

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.840
is gonna be completely boiled, and then

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.060
the King crab is going to
be half boiled half grilled

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.850
but I think it fully goes boiled first.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.850
Oh that is, this is an
aroma therapy spa session,

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.109
I love crab spa session.

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.114
(water boiling)

00:04:07.114 --> 00:04:10.031
(soft house music)

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:22.790
(both speaking in foreign language)

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.460
For the Red King crab we're gonna get it

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.130
two different ways, half
boiled, half grilled.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.840
But he first pre-blanched
it, just for a few minutes

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.370
so they can cut it in half,
half of it he threw back

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.006
into the boiling caldron into
the boiling sink of water

00:04:58.006 --> 00:04:58.890
and then the other half is gonna go

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.643
on the grill and two different ways.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.800
The King crab is ready
they're chopping it up

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.640
and I think the Hanasaki crab

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.877
should be ready very, very soon.

00:05:16.877 --> 00:05:20.794
(speaking in foreign language)

00:05:24.044 --> 00:05:25.737
(laughing)

00:05:25.737 --> 00:05:26.570
Okay.

00:05:36.992 --> 00:05:39.909
(soft house music)

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:42.772
The Hanasaki crab is ready

00:05:42.772 --> 00:05:43.910
actually that took a while to boil

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.850
at least like 20 minutes to boil.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.434
It's so steaming, so hot, so fresh.

00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:53.430
(both speaking in foreign language)

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.105
(crab crunching)

00:05:56.105 --> 00:05:57.938
- Hanasaki.
- Hanasaki.

00:06:00.075 --> 00:06:04.325
(man speaking in foreign language)

00:06:10.063 --> 00:06:12.980
(soft house music)

00:06:18.207 --> 00:06:21.267
- The Hanasaki crab is
actually extremely medium.

00:06:21.267 --> 00:06:26.050
The eggs are just sprouting
and the roe and the meat

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.500
and then they beautifully played it

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.870
they cut everything with the scissors

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:34.590
so that all the shell, they free the meat!

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.507
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.182
Oh yeah it's a lot warmer in here

00:06:45.182 --> 00:06:47.863
and the crabs are ready, both of them.

00:06:49.168 --> 00:06:52.085
(soft house music)

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:59.390
Alright sitting down, we got the one that

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.590
they just finished peeling that's hot

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.819
out of the boiler, this
is the Hanasaki crab.

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:09.200
The color, the brightness, the
orange and reds, the spikes

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:11.540
the eggs just sprouting in the roe.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:14.670
Actually the yellow is the
roe, I don't even know what is

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.160
is that like two roes I'm not even sure.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:19.160
Then this is the King crab which is

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.160
cooked two different ways
both boiled and grilled.

00:07:24.767 --> 00:07:29.767
The crab aroma, the colors,
it's vibrant, it's beautiful.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:33.070
Both of these crabs are
delicacies in Japan,

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:36.350
both of them are from Japan
from the seas especially

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.110
the Red King crab is famous in the winter

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.000
because the meat is the fullest.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.740
And then the Hanasaki
crab I think is also,

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.600
there's different seasons but definitely

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.313
the winter is one of the best
seasons in Japan for crab

00:07:51.313 --> 00:07:54.070
and it is definitely the
middle of the winter.

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:55.330
Okay I think we have to start with

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.670
the Hanasaki crab since this one is fresh.

00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:59.943
This one is right out of the steamer.

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:04.970
I don't even know how to begin (laughs).

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:08.210
We got the legs, you've
got the body there.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.830
That body looks amazing you can see

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.220
the different textures in there.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.750
I guess we just start with the body

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.733
and yeah they scissor cut everything.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.580
It just lifts up like
a lid, oh look at that.

00:08:20.584 --> 00:08:22.650
Oh look at that.

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:27.263
That's packed with meat and
that's pretty sharp too.

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:34.282
Oh wow that's a nugget, first
bite ever of Hanasaki crab.

00:08:34.282 --> 00:08:36.082
You can just smell the crabby aroma.

00:08:42.284 --> 00:08:45.117
(giggles) oh wow.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.750
That flavor is like so sweet and

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.510
this hint of complex bitterness.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.790
Slightly salty I don't know
if it's boiled in salt water.

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.140
The texture of that
meat and like the sweet,

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.390
wow that's unbelievable, the freshness

00:09:03.296 --> 00:09:06.623
that is firm, that's extraordinary!

00:09:09.945 --> 00:09:12.990
(giggles) What I love about it too,

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.180
there's absolutely nothing
on it just straight boiled

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.380
perhaps in salt water
I'm not totally sure.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:22.010
But that is so flavorful,
so good on its own,

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.395
such an amazing product that
you do not need anything.

00:09:25.395 --> 00:09:30.143
(people speaking in foreign language)

00:09:30.143 --> 00:09:30.976
Happy birthday Cobb.

00:09:30.976 --> 00:09:33.143
(giggles)

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.390
I wanna immediately taste
the Red King crab after that

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:37.360
just to taste the difference of

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.243
the meat, so I'll grab a leg.

00:09:43.115 --> 00:09:45.060
(laughs) And Red King
crab I have had before

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.860
but I don't think I've
ever had it this fresh,

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.460
being able to choose my (gasps).

00:09:52.026 --> 00:09:56.320
Oh look at that (giggles) oh wow.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.030
That is just thick with
meat and what I read

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.520
is that during this season,
it's some of the meatiest

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.070
Red crab that you'll ever have.

00:10:06.624 --> 00:10:07.990
(soft house music)

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:12.531
Look at that, that's just pure King crab.

00:10:12.531 --> 00:10:15.448
(soft house music)

00:10:19.917 --> 00:10:22.053
(chuckles) Wow.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.730
That is another speechless,
that is stunning.

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:34.730
It's so sweet, it's so juicy, okay,

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:35.920
and that's awesome to be able to

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.040
taste both right back to back because

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.705
you really taste the difference
between the two crabs.

00:10:40.705 --> 00:10:42.340
Of course they are both
crab but the Hanasaki has

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.313
more of like a bitter complexity to it

00:10:45.313 --> 00:10:49.003
with a really really vibrant crab flavor.

00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:53.170
The Red King crab is a little more

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.199
sweet and definitely a lot more juicy.

00:10:56.199 --> 00:10:59.116
(soft house music)

00:11:01.302 --> 00:11:04.370
Again you do not need anything on that.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:09.370
That is the purest, the sweet
juiciness is remarkable.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:11.820
Okay I'm gonna move back
over to the Hanasaki now

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.070
and I wanna try that floral formation.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.250
I think that's from the body section

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.060
but that's the meat body section
as opposed to the roe yet.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.333
Check this out it's like
a glove, oh it's juicy!

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.600
I think you can just kinda
scoot it with your finger.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.083
Oh yes there's so much meat in here.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:40.490
Okay back to the Hanasaki
crab, I can definitely taste

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.270
that the Red King crab
is sweeter in flavor.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:47.048
Okay they're both good,
so unbelievably good.

00:11:47.048 --> 00:11:50.500
(people speaking in foreign language)

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.410
This is some of the Hanasaki crab roe.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.403
That's a chicken nugget sized chunk.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:03.060
Wow (giggles) that's so rich, kinda yolky,

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.550
like dry in a good kinda way.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:10.500
That's like almost as much as you

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:12.480
possibly wanna take in a single bite

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.063
only because it is such a rich mouthful.

00:12:17.142 --> 00:12:19.940
This one is the other roe and I'm actually

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:23.680
not sure what it is
but we'll try that next

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.830
from the Hanasaki crab.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:29.960
Oh that's kinda awesome that's got

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.540
burst with salty juiciness,
kinda like fish roe.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.890
Almost like poppy seeds you can feel

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:36.993
them squishing between your teeth.

00:12:42.512 --> 00:12:44.720
Oh I just got crab juiced.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.520
There's not really any roe
in the Red King crab but

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.890
we do have the claws
and then the knuckles.

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.603
Actually the knuckles are
some of the best meat.

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:56.033
Look at that boneless shelless nugget.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.030
And one of the best
things about eating huge

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.210
crabs like this, the Red
King crab especially,

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.190
is just how meaty it is and how like

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:05.443
easy it is to eat.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.670
They chop it with scissors but then

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:13.623
the meat just slides out just huge chunks.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.390
It is so sweet, maybe
it's a little more firm

00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:22.930
than the actual legs but the texture

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.793
of the knuckle, it's superb.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.550
Next up for the Hanasaki crab claw,

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.260
let's see how to navigate this guy.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.593
Oh yeah it is kinda spiky,
oh that just comes apart.

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:38.160
You do wanna be careful
not to stab yourself on

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.303
this Hanasaki crab claw.

00:13:41.158 --> 00:13:44.790
That reveals the meat, I
think you can do just kinda

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.240
pull it out with your finger.

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:50.440
Okay that was not a clean
pull out but that's okay.

00:13:51.737 --> 00:13:55.630
The claw is like so firm and then

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.600
it's not stringy but more flakey.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.840
Even the inside of that
crab is completely orange,

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.661
even the little spikes are intact.

00:14:06.661 --> 00:14:09.720
They go into the mold, the shell

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.443
is like the mold of all the meat.

00:14:15.842 --> 00:14:18.000
Hello guy, I'm gonna try that interior,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.520
it's like the head lining which
they've already scooped out

00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:26.120
I don't know what it is
there's a combination of,

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.770
oh yeah look at that chunk.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.000
This is like a combination of head lining

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.530
plus roe plus like tangly bits.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:34.823
It's like helmet lining.

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:44.570
A little bit bitter, we got
the roe in there, the rich roe

00:14:45.638 --> 00:14:50.270
and then yeah kinda like slightly
totally different texture.

00:14:53.061 --> 00:14:54.360
This is one I haven't tried yet,

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.570
the grilled Red King crab leg.

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.710
This is one of the greatest parts, just

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:03.360
opening it up, just to reveal nuggets.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:06.570
Oh beautiful, again,
absolutely spectacular.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:10.153
And I'll just slide my finger down there.

00:15:11.471 --> 00:15:14.388
(soft house music)

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:31.763
What a meal, what a crab meal!

00:15:36.138 --> 00:15:37.360
I think that was just
the right amount of crab,

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.240
we shared with five, there's five

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.590
of us that ate those crabs.

00:15:43.121 --> 00:15:45.100
But that was spectacular,
I don't know if I've ever

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:49.320
had an entire meal of crab
with nothing, no condiments,

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.510
nothing extra on on it.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:53.220
I didn't even feel like I
wanted to use anything extra

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:54.560
on it, it was that good.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.963
Hanasaki you were delicious
and thank you King crab.

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:04.540
To give you an honest opinion,
both are incredibly good

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.950
and have like different taste,
different flavor profiles,

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:08.210
but if I were to just chose one

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.130
I think I would go with the Red King crab.

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:13.750
Yeah it is not called the king
of crabs without a reason.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:16.430
It's so juicy, so sweet, so fresh.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:18.500
But this is a really good place,

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:19.930
they're really friendly here.

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:22.950
I paid 34,000 yen for both of the crabs.

00:16:22.950 --> 00:16:26.130
Which, let me just do the
conversion, that's a little

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:30.100
over 300 US dollars for both the crabs.

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:33.973
Which I think it was a splurge but really,

00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:36.720
it's so fresh, it's so
good, they're so nice

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.133
and that fed five of us.

00:16:39.236 --> 00:16:42.153
(soft house music)

00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:45.240
(people speaking in foreign language)

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.750
Not only do they have seafood here

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:48.020
but also fruits and vegetables

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.260
and this market is well
known for their melons.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:51.680
Unfortunately it's not melon season,

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.680
but they do have melons year round and

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.770
Japanese melons are
some of the most premium

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:00.197
melons in the entire
world so I got a slice.

00:17:00.197 --> 00:17:03.114
(soft house music)

00:17:05.183 --> 00:17:08.730
Oh it's cold, oh it's juicy.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.220
Oh wow okay yeah.

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:14.033
That is a perfect thing after
you eat a bunch of crab.

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:17.620
It's so juicy, it's so refreshing

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:20.563
and that's like icy
cold from being outside.

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.400
All the juiciness!

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.763
It's like sweet but like
a harmony of sweetness.

00:17:35.268 --> 00:17:38.185
(soft house music)

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:46.230
It's really good but really cold.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:50.250
Oh yeah that melon was
so juicy that it made

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.950
my hand all wet and now
my hand is like frozen.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:58.280
Okay the next place that we're gonna go,

00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.700
I think we're gonna step into,

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.140
it's one of the most famous places but

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.680
it really is a legendary place

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:07.100
and even though it attracts tourist buses,

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:10.450
that's the same place that
we saw right as we entered.

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:14.450
They really do say it has
amazing incredibly fresh seafood

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:18.640
and it's an iconic seafood restaurant

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.033
of Hokkaido of Sapporo.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.767
(yelling in foreign language)

00:18:25.767 --> 00:18:27.946
(water running)

00:18:27.946 --> 00:18:30.863
(soft house music)

00:18:33.507 --> 00:18:35.100
An entire seafood market.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.610
On the bottom floor they
have a lot of live seafood.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:40.620
They have more crabs they
have basically everything.

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:42.260
Then on the top floor is a
dining room where you can

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.520
order food so I think we're gonna

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.690
go straight for the dining room.

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.090
We ate the crabs in the morning but

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:49.020
now it's just about lunch
time so there is a line.

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.310
I wanna eat here because
it's such a legendary place

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.278
and the seafood does look incredibly fresh

00:18:54.278 --> 00:18:56.230
and people say good
things about this place.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:58.690
Everything is so organized,
the staff are friendly,

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.713
it's like a happy seafood palace.

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.340
Okay the wait was not that long

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:09.103
that was just like a 10
minute wait, we got a table.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:14.333
Check out this menu,
wait there's another one.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.010
What a beautiful, beautiful laminated menu

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:26.950
with all the different bowls they offer

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:29.600
and many what people come
here to eat are the different

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.703
selection of Donburi rice
bowls topped with seafood.

00:19:36.686 --> 00:19:39.603
(soft house music)

00:19:43.650 --> 00:19:47.380
Every time I see a rice bowl like this

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.880
Japanese style and they have different

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.400
varieties of seafood, the colors,

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.800
it just looks like a blooming flower

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.440
and I love the way it's displayed.

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:58.900
It's not only delicious
but beautiful to look at.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.260
Another thing is when you pick it up,

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:02.130
you can feel that the seafood is cold

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:03.761
but then you can feel on the

00:20:03.761 --> 00:20:05.550
bottom how the rice is still warm.

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.533
So that's another thing about this is

00:20:08.533 --> 00:20:13.513
the contrast of temperatures
in your mouth at the same time.

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:15.263
And I think maybe I'll take off my,

00:20:15.263 --> 00:20:16.826
should I take off my hat?

00:20:16.826 --> 00:20:19.176
No I should no take off
my hat for this meal.

00:20:19.176 --> 00:20:21.430
I think it's okay to
leave your hat on here,

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.580
I see other people with their hats on too.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.580
What to begin with that is
always the main question.

00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:28.190
I think I will start with the salmon eggs,

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:30.020
they're just glistening
and calling my name.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.080
And I'm gonna reach
down, they gotta be eaten

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.123
with a lot of rice, a good ratio.

00:20:40.387 --> 00:20:42.554
(giggles)

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.650
Yeah I love the contrast of temperatures,

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:51.027
the cool seafood with the warm rice.

00:20:51.027 --> 00:20:55.710
The rice is sticky and gooey
and then those salmon eggs

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.560
just pop with that briny liquid.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.320
On to the middle and then I'll
just add a little bit of this

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.263
to each bite, I'm going for the uni next.

00:21:06.282 --> 00:21:09.199
(soft house music)

00:21:14.952 --> 00:21:17.550
Oh wow it's so sweet just with

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.023
that wonderful nuttiness, salmon is next.

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:25.670
These ones are scallops!

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:38.870
Scallop is awesome, so soft,
so sweet, not slimy at all.

00:21:41.698 --> 00:21:44.020
But that wasabi went up my
nose a little bit, I love it.

00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.863
Revolving around again, oh
yes it's time for the tuna.

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:04.530
Slightly warm, so pure just
like butter all the way through.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:06.712
I'm not totally sure what this is

00:22:06.712 --> 00:22:08.023
maybe some kind of surf clam.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.250
Oh yeah it has a crunch to it,

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:13.900
gonna follow that with some rice.

00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:20.503
And then finally, this
is squid maybe, squid?

00:22:24.337 --> 00:22:29.070
Slightly slimy but it chews
and you can taste the sweetness

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.680
coming out of it with every bite.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:31.840
Okay and then finally the crab,

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.135
I haven't had any crab yet today.

00:22:34.135 --> 00:22:37.052
(soft house music)

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.760
I like it both with the
soy sauce and without.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:55.230
It does definitely enhances
the raw seafood but again

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.030
the freshness, the sweetness of the

00:22:57.030 --> 00:22:58.840
natural seafood is what stands out

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.429
and you really don't need anything.

00:23:01.429 --> 00:23:04.762
(soft electronic music)

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:08.450
And then finally for my last bite.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.250
It's a raw shrimp and you can
just see the transparency.

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:15.833
You can almost see how,
yeah it's gonna be sweet.

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.823
I always leave the shrimp
for the end, that is sharp.

00:23:27.111 --> 00:23:28.283
Oh wow!

00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.893
Okay that might be the best
bite of the entire bowl.

00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:36.873
So sweet, the texture is
almost like sticky and gummy.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:42.240
That's just tasty, that is awesomely,

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.404
awesomely fresh and just so sweet.

00:23:45.404 --> 00:23:48.321
(soft house music)

00:23:55.443 --> 00:23:56.720
What amazed me is how
friendly that market is

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.760
and it's like low-key, it's
friendly, people are nice,

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.670
the seafood is so fresh,
so vibrant, so colorful.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:05.150
The colors just pop!

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:07.370
This is the place to come in Sapporo

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:09.610
for crab and for amazing seafood.
