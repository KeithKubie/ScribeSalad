00:00:09.186 --> 00:00:12.126
&gt;&gt;I'm Cameron Murray and I live
here in Westfield, Indiana.

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:14.656
&gt;&gt;All right, kids,
well, you heard it here.

00:00:14.776 --> 00:00:15.296
&gt;&gt;Good morning.

00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:18.466
This is Cameron Murray from WIS news.

00:00:18.466 --> 00:00:19.216
&gt;&gt;Love technology.

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:26.916
&gt;&gt;I just love making
movies and stuff like that.

00:00:27.916 --> 00:00:32.026
&gt;&gt;The very first technology that I
had, it was around when I was four,

00:00:32.606 --> 00:00:36.226
and it was this little red computer.

00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:40.746
It only had little mini games on it
and stuff, but I loved that so much,

00:00:40.746 --> 00:00:41.976
and I played every single day.

00:00:47.386 --> 00:00:51.476
&gt;&gt;My normal day is, I wake
up at around five thirty.

00:00:52.926 --> 00:00:55.146
&gt;&gt;We hear things going on
down in the front entryway

00:00:55.146 --> 00:00:58.436
and furniture being moved
and lampshades being tilted

00:00:58.436 --> 00:00:59.566
to get the right lighting.

00:00:59.856 --> 00:01:02.796
&gt;&gt;You can just see the passion
that he has, and when he's starting

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:05.406
out his day like that, you
can really see his passion.

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:09.476
&gt;&gt;I'm going to transfer
this into iMovie.

00:01:11.096 --> 00:01:14.286
Make it slower or speed it up.

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:16.506
Just see where my hand movements are.

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:20.796
&gt;&gt;You know, to use a
hockey coaching term,

00:01:20.796 --> 00:01:22.746
it's given them the
fire in the belly.

00:01:22.746 --> 00:01:25.666
He's really motivated and it gets
him to wake up at five thirty

00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.036
in the morning and work on skills.

00:01:27.036 --> 00:01:29.116
And sure, he's doing some fun videos,

00:01:29.216 --> 00:01:31.646
but we know that he's building
problem solving skills,

00:01:31.646 --> 00:01:34.846
the ability to learn on his own,
and he's learning as he goes.

00:01:34.846 --> 00:01:37.666
So that's a skill that
I think is invaluable.

00:01:38.486 --> 00:01:41.456
&gt;&gt;I've played hockey
ever since I was three.

00:01:41.836 --> 00:01:45.436
I've been on skates since I was
two, so that's a big passion.

00:01:50.186 --> 00:01:52.776
&gt;&gt;He's at a level now where
he's traveling every weekend,

00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:54.936
and one of the reasons I
think that we got a laptop was

00:01:54.936 --> 00:01:58.676
that we spend almost four to
eight hours a weekend traveling.

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:02.166
So now it's common for
Cam to be in the back seat

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:03.646
and he's just working on a project.

00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:06.206
&gt;&gt;So I could drag iTunes over there.

00:02:06.656 --> 00:02:13.316
This is what I use when I'm doing
a project, so I have Final Cut

00:02:13.316 --> 00:02:16.706
in one square, then the
internet, Photo Booth,

00:02:16.976 --> 00:02:20.476
and so everything's just
a step more organized.

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:24.506
&gt;&gt;I've gone on YouTube a lot
of times and done tutorials,

00:02:24.596 --> 00:02:27.636
like how to do the green screen
effect and stuff like that.

00:02:27.926 --> 00:02:30.416
And so I got nine green
poster boards.

00:02:30.636 --> 00:02:35.646
I put thumb tacks on my garage
and stuck the poster boards

00:02:36.066 --> 00:02:38.676
to the wall in my garage.

00:02:39.186 --> 00:02:43.236
It's not very high tech or anything
but it dos as a green screen.

00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:49.346
And that really, really
got me doing new things,

00:02:49.856 --> 00:02:53.296
like light sabers,
teleporting effects.

00:02:53.976 --> 00:02:56.076
I'm still working on some, so...

00:02:56.726 --> 00:02:58.416
&gt;&gt;Okay, we're gonna watch this video

00:02:58.666 --> 00:03:00.826
on reviewing how to
multiply integers.

00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:04.466
Cameron made us a video of him
walking forward and backward, okay.

00:03:05.096 --> 00:03:06.926
&gt;&gt;I'm a very visual learner.

00:03:07.156 --> 00:03:10.996
If our teacher describes something
that maybe I don't understand,

00:03:10.996 --> 00:03:14.216
I go back and look at it,
and then I picture it.

00:03:14.516 --> 00:03:17.186
I think, "Now what would
that look like if I put it

00:03:17.186 --> 00:03:19.406
on film or on the green screen?"

00:03:19.526 --> 00:03:27.076
&gt;&gt;Now, what if we rewind
it, what are we gonna see?

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:27.876
&gt;&gt;All: Walk backwards.

00:03:28.346 --> 00:03:28.946
&gt;&gt;Walking backwards.

00:03:29.146 --> 00:03:32.016
&gt;&gt;She knows about my technology
skills and I've helped her before

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:34.186
with her computer problems.

00:03:34.616 --> 00:03:37.116
&gt;&gt;Now, what if we walk
backwards and play it forwards?

00:03:38.606 --> 00:03:39.256
&gt;&gt;Walking backwards.

00:03:40.206 --> 00:03:43.816
&gt;&gt;She was teaching this
lesson but she thought

00:03:43.906 --> 00:03:47.126
that it wasn't very exciting.

00:03:47.616 --> 00:03:50.216
&gt;&gt;And what if we rewind it?

00:03:50.916 --> 00:03:52.096
&gt;&gt;All: Walk forwards.

00:03:54.066 --> 00:03:56.806
&gt;&gt;Walking forward.

00:03:57.116 --> 00:04:02.986
&gt;&gt;I made this video called
"Rewind" and I did tons of stuff.

00:04:03.246 --> 00:04:06.906
I poured one glass of water
into the other, and so it looked

00:04:06.956 --> 00:04:09.836
like the water was coming up
from this glass into this one.

00:04:10.566 --> 00:04:13.566
And so I said, "Well, I can
just rewind it for you."

00:04:14.016 --> 00:04:15.856
&gt;&gt;And she just thought
that was awesome.

00:04:16.146 --> 00:04:17.846
It really helped her out.

00:04:18.366 --> 00:04:21.936
&gt;&gt;Okay, so when he was walking
backwards, but we rewound it,

00:04:21.936 --> 00:04:24.226
it looked like he was going forward,

00:04:24.336 --> 00:04:26.346
so a negative times a
negative is a positive.

00:04:26.826 --> 00:04:28.336
&gt;&gt;Okay, you all set?

00:04:28.646 --> 00:04:29.056
&gt;&gt;Yep. Yep.

00:04:29.196 --> 00:04:30.926
&gt;&gt;Here we go.

00:04:31.346 --> 00:04:34.256
&gt;&gt;I produce the announcements
a day in advance

00:04:34.256 --> 00:04:35.846
for the whole school to see.

00:04:36.056 --> 00:04:39.986
&gt;&gt;Cameron decided we
needed a green screen.

00:04:39.986 --> 00:04:43.566
He had developed his own green screen
at home, so we had a perfect wall,

00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:44.606
a perfect place to put it.

00:04:44.606 --> 00:04:46.396
We had another person
who donated the paint,

00:04:46.396 --> 00:04:50.056
and we now have our own green screen
here, which has been fantastic.

00:04:50.246 --> 00:04:52.886
Other students are now using the
green screen, learn how to use that,

00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:56.076
learn how to add backgrounds, learn
how to use the technology we have

00:04:56.076 --> 00:04:58.036
to even enhance their projects.

00:04:58.316 --> 00:05:01.516
&gt;&gt;The computer, it
recognizes the green.

00:05:01.726 --> 00:05:05.306
If you edit it so that
it can be invisible,

00:05:05.826 --> 00:05:08.396
then you can put any
picture behind it.

00:05:08.396 --> 00:05:10.926
And so right now, we have
a jungle scene behind us.

00:05:11.486 --> 00:05:15.566
&gt;&gt;Cameron's a good resource, because
he knows a little more about some

00:05:15.636 --> 00:05:17.106
of the software we have than I do.

00:05:17.426 --> 00:05:18.906
&gt;&gt;Sometimes I know more than the kids

00:05:18.906 --> 00:05:20.746
and sometimes they are
teaching me things, so,

00:05:20.806 --> 00:05:22.146
you know, learning goes both ways.

00:05:22.186 --> 00:05:29.746
&gt;&gt;And thanks for watching
and have a monkey Monday.

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:30.146
[monkey sounds]

00:05:30.146 --> 00:05:32.476
&gt;&gt;One of the things we've talked
about a lot with our teachers is,

00:05:32.586 --> 00:05:35.626
don't be afraid to let the kids
come up and create assignments.

00:05:35.626 --> 00:05:37.836
Actually, most of the time, you'll
be very pleasantly surprised

00:05:37.836 --> 00:05:41.226
when you let them use their strengths
to develop their own lessons.

00:05:41.226 --> 00:05:43.696
You know, and the kids will
work three times harder

00:05:43.696 --> 00:05:45.266
when they're doing
something they really enjoy.

00:05:45.536 --> 00:05:50.046
&gt;&gt;All right, I did my poet
research project on Walt Whitman.

00:05:50.316 --> 00:05:53.666
At the of eleven, he
completed his formal school,

00:05:53.666 --> 00:05:55.586
so at our age, he finished school.

00:05:55.586 --> 00:05:57.246
&gt;&gt;"The World Below the Brine."

00:05:57.646 --> 00:05:59.676
&gt;&gt;"Forests at the bottom
of the sea...

00:05:59.876 --> 00:06:03.706
the change onward from
ours to that of beings

00:06:03.756 --> 00:06:07.866
that walk on other spheres."

00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:08.306
&gt;&gt;All: [applause, cheers]

00:06:08.306 --> 00:06:11.926
&gt;&gt;Thursdays, I do a after
school program called Tech Club

00:06:12.506 --> 00:06:13.716
with Mrs. Esterline.

00:06:14.216 --> 00:06:17.136
&gt;&gt;Every time I introduce any
project that has technology,

00:06:17.336 --> 00:06:22.326
or any lesson that I teach that
has technology, his eyes just open

00:06:22.326 --> 00:06:26.566
and it's just-- you see that he's
just grasping it and just taking it

00:06:26.616 --> 00:06:28.896
and thinking of what
else he could do with it.

00:06:28.896 --> 00:06:30.566
&gt;&gt;So you're nesting sequences.

00:06:30.566 --> 00:06:33.866
&gt;&gt;Right, and now they're not here.

00:06:34.146 --> 00:06:38.846
&gt;&gt;It's just really amazing to me
that he took it upon himself to go

00:06:38.846 --> 00:06:42.626
and learn on his own
through the Apple store.

00:06:42.766 --> 00:06:46.366
I've even had him tutor me
over the summer, because I knew

00:06:46.366 --> 00:06:50.936
that he would be such a great
teacher, and teaching me

00:06:50.936 --> 00:06:52.346
and helping me to understand.

00:06:52.346 --> 00:06:53.056
&gt;&gt;It was admin.

00:06:53.316 --> 00:06:53.966
&gt;&gt;Oh, admin?

00:06:54.386 --> 00:07:00.266
&gt;&gt;What's interesting is that they're
older but they know less than you.

00:07:00.666 --> 00:07:04.166
And so it's fun sometimes
doing it the other way around.

00:07:04.166 --> 00:07:05.916
Instead of your teacher teaching you,

00:07:06.096 --> 00:07:08.306
that you just help
them out on something.

00:07:08.786 --> 00:07:11.096
&gt;&gt;So Cam, how was your day?

00:07:11.196 --> 00:07:11.446
&gt;&gt;Awesome.

00:07:11.596 --> 00:07:14.316
&gt;&gt;Was it really?

00:07:15.066 --> 00:07:16.806
&gt;&gt;Great day, yes.

00:07:21.116 --> 00:07:23.216
&gt;&gt;I really like all types of music.

00:07:23.216 --> 00:07:26.446
My favorite band would probably have

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.056
to be AC DC 'cause I play
the guitar and I like rock.

00:07:29.456 --> 00:07:33.436
I have a rock band,
which is a lot of fun.

00:07:33.656 --> 00:07:36.636
And you actually get to like
play the guitar and do the drums.

00:07:37.276 --> 00:07:40.446
I love video games.

00:07:40.446 --> 00:07:53.976
I try to, you know, keep
my balance on not too much.

00:07:53.976 --> 00:07:54.046
&gt;&gt;Cameron: [plays guitar]

00:07:54.046 --> 00:07:54.976
&gt;&gt;I took three shots.

00:07:54.976 --> 00:07:56.476
One of me playing a
piano of the song.

00:07:56.476 --> 00:08:00.756
[song plays] One of me
playing the guitar of the song

00:08:00.836 --> 00:08:02.216
and one of me singing the song.

00:08:02.736 --> 00:08:05.436
And so it looked like there
were three of me, like clones.

00:08:07.576 --> 00:08:10.806
&gt;&gt;Very rarely, the kids look at
instruction manuals these days.

00:08:11.206 --> 00:08:14.346
So they are empowered to
just go out and learn.

00:08:14.346 --> 00:08:16.586
And if I'm a parent and
I'm wondering, "Wow,

00:08:16.586 --> 00:08:18.536
how do I provide the
wherewithal for my children?"

00:08:18.886 --> 00:08:20.726
just get into their way.

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:22.336
Let them learn.

00:08:22.566 --> 00:08:26.826
Give them the tools and then let
them go, because whether we like it

00:08:26.826 --> 00:08:29.776
or not, they already
have the thinking skills,

00:08:29.776 --> 00:08:30.966
the problem solving skills.

00:08:31.446 --> 00:08:32.776
They know how to collaborate.

00:08:32.916 --> 00:08:33.696
&gt;&gt;This is it.

00:08:33.976 --> 00:08:37.766
&gt;&gt;I just keep on looking and looking
and looking for new things to do on,

00:08:37.816 --> 00:08:40.016
like my movie programs on my Mac.

00:08:40.756 --> 00:08:43.886
&gt;&gt;Like I've totally tricked out the
screen savers and stuff like that.

00:08:44.376 --> 00:08:46.366
And I just love doing it.

00:08:46.366 --> 00:08:48.656
I just think it's so
much fun and this is--

00:08:48.656 --> 00:08:59.976
I think that this is the future.

00:09:00.086 --> 00:09:01.346
&gt;&gt;Have you ever cut grass?

00:09:01.436 --> 00:09:02.376
&gt;&gt;I have cut grass.

00:09:02.496 --> 00:09:05.736
&gt;&gt;It's-- I don't think it's my thing.

00:09:06.436 --> 00:09:11.346
So instead, this summer, I'm going
to send out a neighborhood email,

00:09:12.196 --> 00:09:16.276
saying that if anyone would
like all their picture memories

00:09:16.436 --> 00:09:20.016
and maybe a couple songs,
I could put a slideshow

00:09:20.016 --> 00:09:22.326
with all sorts of transitions
and text.

00:09:22.686 --> 00:09:27.866
I'm ranging from like maybe ten
cents a picture or however I'll lay

00:09:27.866 --> 00:09:30.756
that out, so, that's my summer job.

00:09:32.526 --> 00:09:39.816
&gt;&gt;For more information on what works

00:09:39.816 --> 00:09:42.976
