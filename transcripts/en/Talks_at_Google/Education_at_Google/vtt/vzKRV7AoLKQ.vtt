[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.720
SPEAKER: Dr. Keith
Devlin is a mathematician

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.370
at Stanford University.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.150
He has written 33 books and over
80 published research articles.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.670
He's here today to speak
to us about his new book,

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.770
"Finding Fibonacci,
the Quest to Rediscover

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.060
the Mathematical Genius
Who Changed the World."

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.380
Please join me in
welcoming Dr. Devlin.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:25.851
KEITH DEVLIN: Thank you.

00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:27.100
Thank you everyone for coming.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.641
It's nice to be back
at Google again.

00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:31.460
It's nice to have sunshine
outside as well, especially

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.910
since we had to hike in
from a distant parking lot.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:36.950
"Finding Fibonacci,
the Quest to Rediscover

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.060
the Forgotten Mathematical
Genius Who Changed the World."

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.060
It took us six months to
come up with the title.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.020
And I didn't come up with it,
but some marketing person did.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.440
It's actually a book.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.580
It's about a book.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.550
It's about a book about a book.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.060
And it's about a
book about a book

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.300
about a book, where the last
one is right associative.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.090
The book that we start
with is "Liber Abaci,"

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.930
spelled with double B, and
published in 1202 in Pisa,

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.060
in Italy, handwritten
manuscript.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.280
The book that we
now know, thanks

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.490
to research that was done
in the early 2000s era,

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.350
began the whole of the
modern Western world.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.710
So that was fairly recent.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.260
The book about the book,
where I got involved,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.900
was this book, "The Man of
Numbers," published in 2011.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.850
That was a result
of almost a decade

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.360
of research trying to
understand how Leonardo came

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.640
to write "Liber Abaci,"
and in particular,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.520
whether in factly that
book was the beginning

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.103
of the modern Western world in
terms of finance, and commerce,

00:01:34.103 --> 00:01:37.100
and multinational conglomerates,
and yada, yada, yada.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.952
And we've only known
that for sure since 2003.

00:01:40.952 --> 00:01:43.410
And then because this was a
very different project for me--

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.826
I'm a research mathematician
and all sorts of other stuff,

00:01:45.826 --> 00:01:48.080
and for various reasons I
was interested in Leonardo

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.140
of Pisa, Fibonacci, the
most significant reason

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.890
was that he was an OK ma-- not
exactly a good mathematician,

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.020
but he really was famous
for writing books that

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.340
were read by lots of people.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.590
And I've spent a lot of
my career writing books

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.470
for lots of people, textbooks
and graduate textbooks,

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.545
undergraduate textbooks,
general market books.

00:02:05.545 --> 00:02:07.670
So in a sense, I've been
following in his footsteps

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.414
for a large part of my career.

00:02:09.414 --> 00:02:11.850
But because I was going
into the world of history,

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.729
and I hadn't done any history
before, I kept a diary.

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:17.145
Because I thought
as much you can,

00:02:17.145 --> 00:02:18.978
you just have a record
of the whole process,

00:02:18.978 --> 00:02:20.350
because this was new for me.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.860
And I was learning
as I was going along.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.740
And when the book was
published in 2011,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.690
I had this huge diary
with all these notes

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.030
that I've been gathering.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.780
And I talked with my
agent, and then we

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.696
said, well, we could
turn this into a book it.

00:02:31.696 --> 00:02:35.755
Took a long time to get it
done, and then we eventually

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:36.380
pitched it out.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.160
My agent took it.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.687
Princeton University Press
decided to bring it out.

00:02:40.687 --> 00:02:42.020
And that was like two years ago.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.160
And it's taken another
couple of years

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.180
to actually turn it
into a readable book.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.150
It was just a bunch of notes.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.131
Another book on the way-- there
was actually a fourth book

00:02:51.131 --> 00:02:53.630
that I brought out at the same
time as "The Man of Numbers."

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.500
it was a sort of a compendium
called "Leonardo and Steve,"

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.870
because one of the things
that came very obvious when

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.330
I was doing the research
on "The Man of Numbers"

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.960
was that the history of
Leonardo and "Liber Abaci"

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:11.030
was exactly the same as the
development of the Macintosh

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.010
in the '80s in Silicon Valley.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.240
I mean to the fine details.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.640
In fact, what "Leonardo
and Steve" is,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.470
and it's only in
an ebook version.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.130
We decided since it was about
comparing it with Apple,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.850
it would be only
available in an ebook.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.433
You can get it from
Apple if you want,

00:03:25.433 --> 00:03:28.600
or you can get it from Amazon.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.380
What I did was I took Stephen
Levy's book, "Insanely Great"

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.115
and basically just replaced
Jobs and Macintosh with Leonardo

00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:40.660
and "Liber Abaci," and the
whole thing was the story.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.390
I basically got the story that
was in "The Man of Numbers."

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.390
And so I massaged that a
bit and we brought that out.

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.370
OK, let me start here,
because I can't tell you

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.620
about the new project without
very quickly telling you

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:51.769
about the old project.

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.560
Here's the standard
story of how arithmetic

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.600
comes into the Western world.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.270
We get Hindu Arabic
arithmetic developed in India

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.030
in the early part of the common
term, the first millennia.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.850
Probably the iconic
figure is Brahmagupta.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.780
Then we get al-Khwarizmi in
9th, 10th century Baghdad,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.900
with his books on Hindu
Arabic arithmetic and algebra,

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.290
giving us the words algorithm
and algebra at the same time

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.910
with those two books.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.960
And then we say Leonardo
learned about that in his youth

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.330
from the Arabic texts
and the Persian works

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.910
and all of the stuff
that was floating around,

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:33.429
and brought out his book and
the rest was history, we say.

00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:35.720
Well, let me just tell you
a little bit about Leonardo.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.130
It's got nothing to do with
the Fibonacci Sequence, which

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.170
has almost nothing
to do with Fibonacci.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.240
That was something that was
put in the 19th century.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.850
OK.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.060
Grew up in Piso, father's an
international businessman,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.676
travels to Bugia in North
Africa when he's a teenager.

00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:54.800
He's mathematically gifted.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.924
He's arithmetically gifted.

00:04:55.924 --> 00:04:58.100
I mean, mathematics was
really arithmetic back then,

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.630
a little bit of geometry.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.130
He observed the
Muslim traders, who

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.220
were going up the Silk Route
between the Orient and North

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.800
Africa, saw them using
this, what we now

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.560
know as Hindu Arabic arithmetic,
was very impressed by it.

00:05:12.967 --> 00:05:14.800
When he goes back to
Pisa, well, he actually

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.510
spends a few years
wandering around

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.210
in North Africa around
the Muslim world.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.030
And then, when he gets back,
he writes this mammoth book.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.120
Completes it in 1202,
and it's generally

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.140
regarded as being the beginning
of the modern Western world

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.420
and the way we live our life.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.145
His real name?

00:05:32.145 --> 00:05:32.978
Well, we don't know.

00:05:32.978 --> 00:05:35.470
These people didn't have
the same kind of names.

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.710
He would have been known later
in life as Leonardo of Pisa

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.800
because he became very,
very famous in his lifetime.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.340
He had a name.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.960
He was invited to talk with the
emperor Frederick at the time.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.930
He refers to him in the
book as Filius Bonacci.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.270
It was written in Latin,
handwritten Latin,

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.760
so he calls himself
son of Bonacci.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.580
We should maybe translate
it as of the Bonacci family,

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.770
because his father
wasn't called Bonacci.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.010
They didn't have names.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.520
They were just names associated
with the groups of people,

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.700
with the families.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.590
So it probably means
one of the Bonaccis.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.630
And then that word
Filius Bonacci gets

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.710
contracted by a historian
in the 19th century

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:18.891
into the word Fibonacci.

00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:20.390
So Fibonacci is
just a name that was

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.480
ascribed in the 19th century.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.940
And then the Fibonacci
sequence was actually

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.840
coined by the number
theorist Edward Lucar

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.540
also in the late 19th century.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.360
So most of what we
associate with Fibonacci

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.430
was actually invented by
historians in the 19th century,

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.330
including the name of
the Fibonacci Sequence.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.610
The only connection
of that with Leonardo

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.130
himself is that one of
the hundreds of exercises

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.710
in his books was the rabbit
problem that gives rise

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:48.820
to the Fibonacci Sequence.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.699
But it wasn't
original to Leonardo.

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:51.490
It had been around.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.739
You can trace it way back
to the Hindu mathematicians.

00:06:53.739 --> 00:06:55.785
It's been around a long time.

00:06:55.785 --> 00:06:57.160
We don't know what
he looks like.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.660
There are two
images you can see.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.940
There's a woodcut, which
you can see photographs of,

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.900
and there's a statue in Pisa.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.830
But they're fairly
recent, and so we

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.630
can't assume anything
other than the fact

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:11.260
that those pictures are around,
and that picture and statue are

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.070
around.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.096
Almost certainly, they're
the just conceptions.

00:07:16.096 --> 00:07:16.970
What else do we know?

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.262
We know a little bit about him.

00:07:18.262 --> 00:07:19.803
Some of this we
didn't even know when

00:07:19.803 --> 00:07:21.880
I started my studies,
because some of it was only

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.140
found out while I was working.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.270
I was traveling to
Italy every year.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:28.814
He wrote a bunch
of books, though.

00:07:28.814 --> 00:07:30.980
This, by the way, is the
second edition of the book.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.530
The first one didn't survive.

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:35.490
The second one was at
the end of his career,

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.400
or at least 20 years later, 26
years later, whatever it is.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.070
And this was an image
that I had taken

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.279
from the original manuscript.

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:44.694
One of the nice
things about this,

00:07:44.694 --> 00:07:46.380
if you go to Italy,
at least back then,

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:48.747
and you had an association
with a major university,

00:07:48.747 --> 00:07:50.080
they'll let you in the archives.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.110
And I sat and had this
copy of "Liber Abaci",

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.307
this 13th century copy of
"Liber Abaci", in my hands,

00:07:56.307 --> 00:07:58.390
and measured it, and sniffed
it, and did all kinds

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.674
of things one might want to do.

00:08:01.674 --> 00:08:04.090
But he wrote that second edition
at the end of his career,

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:05.885
when he was a famous person.

00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:06.760
Other books he wrote?

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.634
He wrote a massive,
massive book on geometry.

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.470
He wrote a series of solutions
to problems, challenge problems

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.400
that he was given.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:19.822
They of had a 13th century
version of Jeopardy,

00:08:19.822 --> 00:08:22.280
where you go in front of an
audience and you ask questions.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.350
He was probably given
the questions in advance,

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:25.891
but they were tricky
questions and he

00:08:25.891 --> 00:08:28.304
gives very brilliant answers.

00:08:28.304 --> 00:08:30.470
There was a book on number
theory, elementary number

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.862
theory, "The Book of Squares"
about Pythagorean triples.

00:08:33.862 --> 00:08:36.320
And then there's a reference
to another book that he wrote,

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.609
which was supposed to be
"Liber Abaci for Dummies,"

00:08:40.609 --> 00:08:41.900
we might want to call it today.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.358
It was meant to be
a simple version

00:08:43.358 --> 00:08:45.769
that the ordinary
traders could read.

00:08:45.769 --> 00:08:47.810
And it was probably in
the vernacular of Italian,

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.570
but we don't know because
no copies were found.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.640
So that's the standard story.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.320
But there was a
big question mark.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.580
Did Leonardo really
have the influence

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.030
that people would
assume that he did?

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:02.221
Well, here was the reason
why they assumed it.

00:09:02.221 --> 00:09:04.470
His book appears at the
beginning of the 13th century.

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:09.435
Within the next 30 or 40 years,
coming out of Pisa, Florence,

00:09:09.435 --> 00:09:12.730
that general area, we
have modern banking,

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.990
we have insurance companies,
we have international trading

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.940
empires being run out of Pisa.

00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:21.060
We have double entry bookkeeping
coming out of Florence.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.680
All at that time.

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.110
So, boy, is there correlation.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:27.870
The question was,
is that correlation

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.670
because of causation?

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.640
Was it because
they got his book,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.581
they had access to
Hindu Arabic arithmetic,

00:09:34.581 --> 00:09:36.330
and they developed a
whole bunch of stuff?

00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:39.960
I'll come back to
that, because that

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.239
was what this whole
story was about,

00:09:42.239 --> 00:09:44.280
looking in a little bit
more detail what happened

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.340
after the book came out.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.490
Within a few years,
you have the beginning

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:52.950
of an enormous number of
handwritten manuscripts

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.980
on teach yourself arithmetic,
commercial arithmetic.

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.330
They're now called abacus books.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.580
They weren't discovered
until the 1960s,

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:01.250
but there's a lot
of them around.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:03.360
250 have survived.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.610
We can extrapolate that there
must have been thousands

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.609
of these things written,
because these were just

00:10:07.609 --> 00:10:09.000
written by people themselves.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.040
If you wanted to learn
commercial arithmetic,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.370
you went to wherever in town
had a copy of a manuscript,

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:17.282
you copied it slavishly,
and then you went home

00:10:17.282 --> 00:10:18.990
and you studied it
and worked through it.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.080
That's how they worked.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.360
All of the manuscripts have
this form that there were slave

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.810
easily copied,
and then they were

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.330
annotated when the people
went through and tried

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.200
to learn from them.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.160
And so these were mainly
written for people themselves,

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.760
ordinary people
trying to learn it.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.790
If 250 of those have survived
when these were just books

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.640
that people had
written 800 years ago,

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.890
there's got to have been an
awful lot of them written,

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.240
because no one would have
thought or valued them

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.957
to the point of trying
try to save them.

00:10:47.957 --> 00:10:49.790
There were lots of
schools that were formed.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:51.240
There was a whole
bunch of activity.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.614
So you've got this
massive amount

00:10:52.614 --> 00:10:55.790
of activity taking place,
at the beginning of the--

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.920
shortly within a few
decades of the appearance

00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.580
of "Liber Abaci."

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.010
Those are facts.

00:11:01.010 --> 00:11:01.824
This is all data.

00:11:01.824 --> 00:11:02.990
We've got all of this stuff.

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:04.580
We know that happened.

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.700
We also know-- or we
think we know, thanks

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.400
to a professor of
finance at Yale,

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.020
who would looked
through "Liber Abaci"

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:16.860
and traced back all of
modern finance methods.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:18.592
And this is a long paragraph.

00:11:18.592 --> 00:11:20.300
There's no intention
of you reading this.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:22.160
It's just to say that we've
got a bunch of stuff now,

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.400
and it's all in the book.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.270
It's all in both of
our books, in fact.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.100
He actually went
through and traced back

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:32.120
all of the modern
financial systems

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.590
and said there's actually
exercises in "Liber Abaci" that

00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:37.790
refer to all of
them, essentially

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.550
the beginnings of this stuff.

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.780
OK, the doubts were that
there's an enormous difference

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:47.840
between "Liber
Abaci," which we have.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.670
There's for good copies
of it in existence,

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:55.460
and there's another seven
or so in partial existence.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:57.936
So these, all of these
things were the same.

00:11:57.936 --> 00:11:59.310
They were copied
from each other.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.184
They were short books
that were in vernacular

00:12:01.184 --> 00:12:02.546
Italian for the most part.

00:12:02.546 --> 00:12:04.170
And they all have
lots of similarities.

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.240
They copied the exercises.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:05.990
They updated them.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:07.762
They changed them
into local currencies.

00:12:07.762 --> 00:12:09.470
So there were minor
differences, but they

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.380
were all in a clear genre.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.260
The mathematics was
absolutely in here.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.720
But in here, it was in
a very different form.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.640
It was in scholarly Latin.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.320
It was very difficult examples.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.510
It was worked out in the
way of Euclid's "Elements,"

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.310
with the axioms and proofs.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.230
This was hard reading.

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:29.630
An average trader wouldn't
have been able to follow that.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:34.070
So the point was, how did
this material get there?

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:35.870
Either it came from
that book, and someone

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:38.130
did that translation,
more than a translation.

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:40.830
They simplified it grossly.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.040
Or else it came
from another source.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.540
That was the big question.

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.900
The clue it turned out
was to look at everything

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:52.590
else he'd written.

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.590
Because most of those
abacus books, most

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.150
of those commercial
arithmetic books,

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.400
they also included a
chapter on geometry.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.530
Well, there was no
geometry in "Liber Abaci".

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.010
The geometry was
in this other book.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:07.790
So that means whoever started
writing the first, whoever

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:09.710
wrote the first of
those abacus books

00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:11.780
not only was able to
read and understand

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.060
Leonardo's scholarly
tome, "Liber Abaci",

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.890
but also read and understand
his other scholarly tome,

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.189
"Practical Geometry."

00:13:20.189 --> 00:13:21.480
So that's an awful lot of work.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.510
These are 600 or
700 page manuscripts

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.150
in dense, scholarly Latin.

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:29.690
Now, either there was
somebody else around,

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:31.940
who was taking that
material and made

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.380
it available to
all of the traders

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.809
and the ordinary working
people, or else Leonardo did it.

00:13:36.809 --> 00:13:38.600
But if there had been
somebody else around,

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.016
it's kind of weird
that we haven't

00:13:40.016 --> 00:13:42.770
got any manuscripts written
by another great mathematician

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:43.850
of that time.

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:46.490
So there's a lot of
circumstantial evidence

00:13:46.490 --> 00:13:49.020
that Leonardo had done it.

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:51.120
And the guess was.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.010
He refers in his
writings to having

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.320
written this book
in a smaller manner,

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.870
or sometimes called "The
Book for Merchants."

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:01.490
He says that he's written a
smaller version of this thing,

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:08.100
but no copies have been
found, except in 2003,

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:12.120
two years after I'd started
going to Italy on this project,

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.580
wondering if I'd
ever write a book,

00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:18.090
I got to know the most eminent
scholar about that period

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:21.810
in medieval mathematics,
Rafaella Franci.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.440
And while I was there, she
was making a discovery.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.390
She basically found it.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:33.025
She found that connection
book, that missing link.

00:14:33.025 --> 00:14:35.400
It certainly wasn't written
in Leonardo's old [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.191
we don't know that.

00:14:36.191 --> 00:14:39.090
It almost certainly wasn't
written in Leonardo's hand.

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.220
There were some silly
math mistakes that

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:44.089
would suggest that was a copy.

00:14:44.089 --> 00:14:45.880
But that would mean it
was almost certainly

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.884
a faithful copy, because
if you don't understand it,

00:14:48.884 --> 00:14:50.050
you don't try to improve it.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:51.370
You just try to copy it.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:55.040
So we have something that
looks like that manuscript.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.950
There's the person that
made it, Rafaella Franci.

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.650
That's where that
manuscript is now.

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:02.590
It's just up from the
Duomo in Florence,

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:06.610
in a rather interesting library
with a beautiful ceiling, which

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:10.480
took me an awful lot
of trouble to get into.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.770
That's the only known copy.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:15.640
That is the first popular
arithmetic book in the West.

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.450
There's a couple of pages I had
copied from it, images taken.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:20.860
It was written,
this one, we know

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:24.700
from looking at the currencies,
was written around 1290,

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.740
so just after Leonardo had died.

00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:31.360
So it was either a copy of his
manuscript or something else.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.850
But by looking at
that in detail,

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:36.400
and doing a bunch
of other analyses,

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.740
the conclusion has now
got pretty definite

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.520
that it was a copy of the thing
that Leonardo had written.

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:44.314
In the introduction,
he says, the author

00:15:44.314 --> 00:15:45.730
of this thing, the
unknown author,

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:51.220
says it's actually written
in the form of Leonardo.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:51.910
OK.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.590
So now we actually
know what that

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:55.390
must look like,
because this one,

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:59.840
you can clearly trace this
to all of the other ones.

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.090
This is the Eve.

00:16:01.090 --> 00:16:03.360
This is the Eve book
of those surveys.

00:16:08.859 --> 00:16:10.900
This was a copy of something
was written that all

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.850
of the other ones came from.

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:17.011
This is really close
after "Liber Abaci".

00:16:17.011 --> 00:16:19.240
That was what gave
them material.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.640
And by looking at all
of the circumstances,

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.380
we now have historical evidence.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.000
And this is again
just wallpaper.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.160
There's a lot of evidence
because after she

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.820
did that discovery, a lot of
scholars started looking at it,

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.970
and there's a whole bunch of
studies that have been done,

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:35.650
establishing with
as much certainty

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.885
as you're going to get in
history that that question

00:16:37.885 --> 00:16:39.610
mark doesn't need to be there.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:40.720
That is a fact.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.300
It came from him, and
it came from the book

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:46.330
that he wrote for merchants.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.320
Interesting question
shortly after this.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:50.530
The guy's famous.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:53.490
All sorts of stuff's going on,
and then he gets forgotten.

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:56.980
Why does he get forgotten?

00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:59.200
Technology.

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.470
Handwritten manuscripts
became completely irrelevant

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:04.839
the moment the
printing press arises.

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:08.082
It takes a long time to copy
a mathematical manuscript,

00:17:08.082 --> 00:17:10.540
but when you put it in typeset,
you can make lots of copies

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:11.800
instantly.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.677
So the moment the
printing press came along,

00:17:13.677 --> 00:17:15.760
there were two books that
were printed very early.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.410
One was the Gutenberg Bible.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:20.740
Another one was a practical
arithmetic book from that canon

00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.599
of practical arithmetic books.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:24.280
So the demand was high.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.800
There was immediately
a printed one produced,

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:31.240
but the printed book was
based on these smaller

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.730
books for merchants,
not on Leonardo's book.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:36.607
So by now, Leonardo's book's
200 years old or more.

00:17:36.607 --> 00:17:38.440
It's just going to sit
there on the shelves.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.180
No one's going to
look at it anymore,

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.320
because the material
is accessible in books.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.630
So he was an early
victim of technology.

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:49.180
The only way we know about
him, because he was completely

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.400
forgotten for
hundreds of years, was

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.070
that a famous
mathematician, Luca Pacioli,

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:58.810
wrote a printed book called
"Summa de Arithmetica,"

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:01.060
arithmetic, geometry,
proportions, proportionality,

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:05.170
a general book, a scholarly book
but on practical arithmetic.

00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:07.960
And he has an
introduction in which he

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.450
says he's based it on Leonardo.

00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:15.380
And then into the early
late 18th, 19th century,

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.469
a historian, a historian
of mathematics,

00:18:17.469 --> 00:18:19.760
actually a mathematician who
was interested in history,

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.720
is studying this
famous book, sees

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:28.220
this reference to this Leonardo,
and says, hm, who is that guy?

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.920
And he digs around, finds
out, and bit by bit,

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:31.970
he uncovers the story.

00:18:31.970 --> 00:18:36.840
So since then, we've
known about Leonardo.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.090
So that's what's in
"The Man of Numbers."

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:42.150
What I started to do in
2002, actually in 2001,

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.780
but my first trip to
Italy was in 2002,

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:48.090
was to find out that story.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:51.740
And then that was when I
started writing this diary.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.160
So here's what I did.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.934
First of all, I tried to get
a sense of what life was like.

00:18:56.934 --> 00:18:58.100
There was almost no history.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:59.170
There were no facts.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:00.410
I had to recreate this.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:04.700
I actually had to do what that
person did with that engraving

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:05.930
or with the statue.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:09.870
I had to try and recreate
a model, or an image,

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:14.000
a story of Leonardo that
fitted what facts we know,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.560
and that made sense.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.480
So I did two things.

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.130
I read a lot of his
stuff, because you

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:20.990
can get a lot of understanding
of a mathematician

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:22.031
by looking at their work.

00:19:22.031 --> 00:19:25.040
And he wrote a lot.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.010
And I also wandered around
Pisa and various other places

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:29.960
to just get a sense of it.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.340
Because this is the part
of Pisa that we all know,

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:37.070
the Leaning Tower, the
Camposantto at the bottom,

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.555
and the Baptistry,
and the monasteries.

00:19:39.555 --> 00:19:41.680
Whatever you call it, the
monastery, the cathedral.

00:19:44.570 --> 00:19:46.100
All of which was there.

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.920
Actually, the Leaning
Tower was being built

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.600
while Leonardo was a child.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.670
So all of that existed.

00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:54.520
It was a port.

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:56.970
It was a port, even though
it's nowhere near the sea.

00:19:56.970 --> 00:20:00.600
It's about 20 miles from the
sea, from the Mediterranean.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.940
But it was a port because
flat bottom boats could go

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.370
from the Mediterranean shore.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.850
And so Pisa and Florence
were both ports.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.921
They were major trading ports.

00:20:10.921 --> 00:20:12.420
Some of the old
buildings, including

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.790
one of the old customs houses
where Leonardo's father

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:17.360
would have been working at
some point, they still exist.

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.350
So these are all
images I took and tried

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:21.930
to get a sense of the place.

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.540
Because this is Italy and no
one knocks buildings down very

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:28.140
often, you can actually see what
kind of place he would live in.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.020
So we have a lot of images.

00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:33.660
We can get a good sense of
what life must have been like.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.850
So just by walking around
Pisa and taking photos,

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:40.590
I try to get a sense in my mind
of what the guy was looking at.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:43.500
We know that he left
to go to North Africa.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.730
He would have gone to
Livorno on one of the ships.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.160
Part of the old
port is still there.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.910
And there's the
new version of it.

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:54.330
So that's now a major,
a major shipping port.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:57.890
But it was a major shipping port
back in the time of Leonardo.

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:05.680
Leonardo would have gone out
on a dirt road, on a cart.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.780
Now there's a very fast
road that takes you

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:09.850
down there pretty quickly.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:13.300
And that's what
Livorno looks like now.

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.670
Next thing I wanted to
do was find the statue.

00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:18.650
That was interesting.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:24.600
The statue was actually
created not long after people

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.120
after that discovery
was made, after Casale

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.820
made that discovery of
Leonardo and he became famous,

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.810
then Pisa pretty
quickly said, hey,

00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:33.572
we've had a famous
guy in our history,

00:21:33.572 --> 00:21:34.780
and decided to celebrate him.

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.720
They had this statue
made of Leonardo.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.870
That was the statue at the
end of the Second World War

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:42.690
when there had been one hell of
a battle over the bridge here.

00:21:42.690 --> 00:21:47.020
That was a photo I took in 2002,
or 2003, of the same location.

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.380
The only things that
had been left standing

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.771
was that building and that
statue that was in front of it.

00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:55.020
Somewhere, I have a photo
of me standing there, trying

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.070
to pretend I'm Leonardo.

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:02.470
And I wanted to find it.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:03.970
And I'd seen pictures
of this thing.

00:22:06.922 --> 00:22:08.380
After the second
war, it was moved.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.390
It was just put in storage.

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:13.330
I got references that said it
had been taken out of storage

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:17.400
in 1966 and put in this garden.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:20.340
And indeed, I was able to
look at photographs of it

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:23.880
in the garden, where it was
obviously a major meeting

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.820
point for birds, who would--

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:31.890
I guess it was a gender
neutral bathroom for birds,

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.310
I would imagine.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:35.970
But it wasn't there.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.650
The statue wasn't there.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:41.550
And so the information I'd
got wasn't very helpful.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:44.520
So looking at it
a little bit more,

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:49.260
I found references that said
the statue had been moved

00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:53.309
into a cemetery near the main
square with the Leaning Tower

00:22:53.309 --> 00:22:53.850
and whatever.

00:22:53.850 --> 00:22:55.350
But there's only
one cemetery there.

00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:58.040
It's a small Jewish cemetery,
and Leonardo was surely

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.910
Catholic, so it would
be unlikely he was

00:22:59.910 --> 00:23:02.280
buried in a Jewish cemetery.

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.680
But that was me peering into
the Jewish cemetery, saying,

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.360
is he there?

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.080
And then you're walking
around afterwards,

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.882
thinking where is this statue?

00:23:11.882 --> 00:23:13.590
There was one of these
signs for tourists

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:19.980
that said "Camposanto
the Monumental Cemetery."

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:24.060
So at that point, it
was an aha moment.

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.160
Yes, that must be the cemetery.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.780
And indeed, there was
the statue in there.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.480
It's at the end of a
long corridor in a very

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.960
splendid position.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:39.880
It's high profile,
all nicely cleaned up.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.090
A couple of years
later, I had many trips.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:46.200
I went to look at one of the
other dedications to Leonardo

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.920
you'll find there.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.700
There's a commemorative
tablet in this building,

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:54.840
just along from that bridge
where the statue used to be.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.920
And it was a commemorative
tablet put up in 1867.

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.750
Again, shortly after
they had rediscovered

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.450
their famous person.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.912
And there's this
Latin translation.

00:24:04.912 --> 00:24:07.370
I actually learned Latin at
school, but couldn't read this,

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:11.640
because this is classical
medieval marketing Latin, which

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.080
is a very weird kind of Latin.

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.950
So I got a very famous
Latin scholar in Los Angeles

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:19.022
to do the translation for me.

00:24:19.022 --> 00:24:20.230
And that is that translation.

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:21.670
It's in the book.

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:24.017
And that's me sitting
in front of this thing

00:24:24.017 --> 00:24:25.100
when I'd finally found it.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.470
Other memorabilia.

00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:32.430
So in Pisa, and in
Florence in particular,

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:35.220
there were street
signs dedicated

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:38.040
to Leonardo Fibonacci.

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.070
There's a couple of nice ones
on the Lung'arno Fibonacci,

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.980
which becomes the Lung'arno
Galileo a little bit further

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:45.720
on.

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:50.200
Florence has a little
street with 11 signs.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:52.800
There's seven of them.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.520
And there's the rest of them.

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.100
So this tiny little street--
it's only a couple of meters

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:57.730
long--

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:00.760
has signs everywhere
to Fibonacci.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:05.350
It also is the home of the
Italian Computer Society, which

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:10.990
obviously was very, very keen
to get an address on Fibonacci,

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:13.125
not a Fibonacci
number, unfortunately,

00:25:13.125 --> 00:25:15.000
but they came close, right?

00:25:18.026 --> 00:25:19.400
And then there's
the manuscripts.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.900
I'm going to give you just a
quick look at the manuscripts,

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:21.840
because these are beautiful.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.256
These are handwritten
manuscripts.

00:25:23.256 --> 00:25:26.010
There's the library in Siena.

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.460
It was at the time of
the Palio, so there

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.080
were all of these flags there.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.680
There were a couple of
really crummy pages,

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.260
but there are some
beautiful pages.

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.580
And these are all images that
I had made of this manuscript.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.290
It obviously had
been worked through,

00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:43.540
because there's the text,
and someone had gone through

00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:44.950
and done some calculations.

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:48.970
Leonardo himself would put this
kind of thing in the border.

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:51.130
Since this was before
the printing press, what

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:56.695
they did was they
wrote the text in words

00:25:56.695 --> 00:25:58.570
together with the
numerals, because words are

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:00.070
self-error-correcting, right?

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:03.310
Humans can error-correct words.

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:08.170
And When these were hand-copied,
errors would come in.

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:11.110
So mathematics was presented
in words with numerals,

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.990
because that's a natural
error-correcting system.

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:16.600
The mathematics itself
was put in the margin,

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.660
and the author assumed that
that could get badly mangled.

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.760
After the printing
press, that flipped.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.370
Mathematics became
symbolic, and the words

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:26.254
were the explanations
of the mathematics.

00:26:26.254 --> 00:26:27.670
Whereas before the
printing press,

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:29.920
mathematics was in
words, and the symbols

00:26:29.920 --> 00:26:33.850
were an explanation or an
extrapolation from the words.

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:37.590
It's interesting how we
adapt to new technologies.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:40.660
So there's the Siana manuscript,
some nice images from it.

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:42.950
I got to see the
one in Florence.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.670
There's the entrance
to the library.

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:49.360
Looks a little bit different,
different kind of paper,

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:49.870
parchment.

00:26:49.870 --> 00:26:51.495
It's like paper, I
guess you'd call it.

00:26:54.252 --> 00:26:55.210
I mean, it's parchment.

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.070
Actually, I guess
it's parchment.

00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:57.850
It's thin.

00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:59.787
It's quite high
quality parchment.

00:26:59.787 --> 00:27:01.120
It looks a little bit different.

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.703
The colors are a
little bit different,

00:27:02.703 --> 00:27:05.080
but essentially the
same manuscripts.

00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.280
One of the other ones,
the really good one--

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.490
there were three
really good ones--

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:10.420
is in the Vatican.

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.300
Unfortunately, when I
was doing this research,

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:15.155
the Vatican Library
Collection was closed.

00:27:15.155 --> 00:27:16.030
They were renovating.

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:18.670
So I've never yet
got to see that one.

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:21.299
And I want to go and
see that manuscript.

00:27:21.299 --> 00:27:23.590
And I'll show you a couple
of pages for the Riccardiana

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:26.380
Manuscript, and
some print versions.

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:35.850
Those are the only known
print versions of this thing.

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:38.840
And we're done.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:39.740
Thank you.

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.490
[APPLAUSE]
