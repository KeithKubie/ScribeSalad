00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.499
Last week, I told you about equilibrium, which
is proof,

00:00:02.499 --> 00:00:05.580
if you ever needed proof, that the universe
is trying to mess with us,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.280
because even though we think and talk about chemical reactions as being a straightforward process,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.410
often times they're also going backwards.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.530
At the same time, the reactants are combining to form products like nitrogen and hydrogen to make ammonia,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.800
or hydrogen and fluorine to make hydrogen
fluoride.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.770
The products are also breaking back apart
into the reactants.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.060
So there's a sweet spot.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.160
One particular ratio of reactants to products where the products form at the same rate that they break down.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.619
When a reaction hits that spot, it's said
to be in its equilibrium state.

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.860
A bit of a kick in the head.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.120
But of course you're not totally at chemistry's
mercy;

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.050
you can tinker with chemical equilibrium by
altering the concentration of the substances

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.980
and their temperature and if they're gases,
the pressure on them.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.760
For example, adding pressure to the Haber
Process that we use to create ammonia essentially

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.120
shifts the position of equilibrium,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.309
so the result of the reaction is more ammonia
being produced than nitrogen and hydrogen.

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.469
But, wouldn't it be a lot more helpful if
you knew

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.449
how much pressure you'd have to add to produce
the exact amount of ammonia you needed,

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.329
or how much hydrogen fluoride it takes to
refine a certain volume of gasoline.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.869
Math, of course, is the way to answer questions like these, so today I'm going to show you some simple,

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.049
totally non-scary calculations that will help
you get a handle on chemical equilibrium.

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:21.589
[Theme Music]

00:01:21.589 --> 00:01:27.520
The first and most important thing you need to do equilibrium calculations is the equilibrium constant.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.499
This number is unique for every reaction and
represents

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:36.049
a molar ratio of products over reactants when
a reaction is at equilibrium.

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.609
Equilibrium constants are easy to set up but
hard to explain,

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:43.849
so let's start with an example using this
obviously fake chemical equation.

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:46.639
The capital letters stand for the reactants
and the products

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:49.249
and the lowercase letters stand for their
coefficients.

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:53.739
The equilibrium constant, or Keq, is equal to the product of the molar concentration of the products

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:56.679
divided by the product of the molar concentration
of the reactants.

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.559
Each concentration is raised to the power
of its coefficient in the balanced equation.

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:04.239
Now this is important; we're using the coefficients
as exponents here

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:08.239
because we're multiplying all the products
and all the reactants,

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.599
not adding them like you would do in a balanced
equation.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:18.380
Generations of students have messed up test scores by getting this part wrong, but you will not do that.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:24.120
So again, it's the product of the products of the product of the reactants and the coefficients become exponents.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.319
Actually pretty simple.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:29.939
The square brackets in the formula are used
by chemists to represent molar concentration,

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.959
or molarity: moles of solute per liter of
solution.

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.000
These equilibrium constant equations and the
constants themselves

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.450
are one of the few places where you don't
need to write them with every number.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.969
Just remember to convert everything into molarities
before plugging numbers into the equation.

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.939
One last thing before we do a calculation:
as we learned in the last episode,

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:49.329
a change in temperature changes the position
of equilibrium.

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.480
Therefore, the equilibrium constant is only
true for a specific temperature.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.739
Constants are normally calculated at 25 degrees
Celsius, which is close enough for most situations,

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.620
but the temperature should always be mentioned
along with the constant.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.800
Fortunately for us, chemists have already figured out the equilibrium constants for most common reactions.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.040
Carbonic acid, for instance, which is basically
just carbon dioxide dissolved in water,

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.680
dissociates to form carbonate ions and hydrogen
ions.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.499
You'll see this reaction again later when we talk in depth about carbon and the planet's carbon cycles.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:25.560
More importantly, right now, the reaction is perfectly reversible with an equilibrium constant of 1.66 x 10^-17.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.220
For this reaction, Keq equals the product of the molar concentration of the carbonate ion

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.560
and the molar concentration of the hydrogen
ion,

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.499
which is squared because hydrogen's coefficient
in the balanced equation is 2,

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:40.099
all divided by the molar concentration of
carbonic acid.

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.120
Now, let's not be boring and throw a bunch
of numbers around.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:49.519
What you need to see is that the quotient on the right must always yield the same number because it's a constant.

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.519
So, if the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere increases leading to more H2CO3 in the earth's water,

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:01.080
the concentration of carbonate ions and/or hydrogen ions must also increase so the total will match the Keq.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.469
You should also notice that any change to
the concentration of hydrogen ions

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:08.319
will have a huge effect on the denominator
because its square.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.960
So an increase in hydrogen ions, like if the water were somehow acidified by an outside source,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.100
would require a huge decrease in carbonate
ions or a huge increase in carbonic acid â€”

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.949
carbon dioxide pulled in from the atmosphere
to satisfy the equilibrium condition again.

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.549
We can attack this problem from another direction, too, depending on what information we have to begin with.

00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:29.760
Chemists often know not only the equilibrium
constant for a reaction,

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.560
but also how much of each reactant is available.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.720
And all they need to figure out is exactly how much of each substance will be present at equilibrium.

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:40.419
This type of calculation is easiest using
a format called a RICE table.

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.930
RICE stands for Reaction, Initial, Change,
and Equilibrium.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.419
On the R line at the top of the table, we
write the chemical equation of reaction,

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.840
leaving space between each part so we'll have
room to add more information below.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.639
On the I line we write the initial concentrations
of each substance.

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.240
Some of those will almost always be zero, since products generally aren't present until the reaction begins.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.490
The C line is where we map out how much of
each substance will change during the reaction.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.930
We often don't know exactly how much this
is until we do the math,

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.580
so we start out with x, where the amount is
unknown.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:16.919
The E line is where we put the final result: how much of each substance will be present at equilibrium.

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.079
Since the final amount is just the initial
amount plus any changes that have occurred,

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.740
this line is the sum of the initial line and
the change line.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.320
Let's do this for hydrogen fluoride, or HF, an integral part of the process of refining gasoline.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.599
It can be formed in the gaseous state by an equilibrium reaction between hydrogen gas and fluorine gas.

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:38.550
Start by writing the balanced equation.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.960
For our initial concentrations,

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:47.479
let's use 3.00 mol of H2 and 6.00 mol of F2
in a 3.00 liter container at a certain temperature.

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:52.770
That makes the initial concentration of H2
3 moles in 3 liters, or a 1.00 molar solution.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.930
Similarly, the initial concentration of the
F2 is 6 moles per 3 liters, or 2 molar.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.099
No HF has formed yet, so it's initial concentration
is 0.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.460
So what we're trying to figure out is how
much of the hydrogen and the fluorine

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.389
will react to form hydrogen fluoride under
these conditions.

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.520
So we'll call the change 'x' for now.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.370
Since 1 mole of H2 and 1 mole of F2, combine
to form 2 moles of HF.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:20.200
We can say that the H2 and F2 will each lose 'x' moles per liter while the HF gains 2x moles per liter.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.440
That's on the change line of your table.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.979
So that leaves the equilibrium line where
you write your totals.

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:32.860
For H2 we have a total of 1.00 - x molar.
For F2 the total is 2.00 - x.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.199
For the HF the total is 2x molar.

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:39.009
Now we apply these figures to our formula
for the equilibrium constant.

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:44.081
Based on the table in the back of my textbook, the Keq for this reaction is 115 at the given temperature.

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:47.460
We plug in the numbers from our RICE table
and solve for x.

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:51.610
And we end up with this. Which you probably
recognize as a quadratic equation.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.490
Just so you know that doesn't happen with every equilibrium calculation, but it's an extremely common result.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:59.740
To solve the quadratic equation we have to
use the quadratic formula.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:05.590
And to do that we have to think of the coefficients
of our equation as a, b, and c in that order.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.120
Then we plug them in the corresponding positions
in this formula:

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:15.349
-b +/- the square root of b2 - 4ac, all divided
by 2a.

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:17.500
Once we finally get all the numbers in the
right places,

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.550
it becomes a matter of grinding through some
basic algebra.

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.680
And because of the way the quadratic formula
works, we'll get 2 possible answers.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.620
To figure out which one is the right one,
think back to the beginning of the problem.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:35.300
I said the initial concentration of the H2 was 1 molar, and the initial concentration of the F2 was 2 molar.

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.340
And x is the amount that each one lost, right?

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:43.240
Well neither the H2 nor the F2 could possibly
lose 2.13 moles per liter

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.599
when they both started with less than that
already.

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:50.259
So clearly, the correct answer has to be 0.968
molar.

00:07:50.259 --> 00:07:54.080
Using that then, we can calculate the actual
equilibrium amounts for each substance.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:59.090
At equilibrium, under these specific conditions
the concentration of HF is 2x,

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:02.719
or 2 x 0.968,
which equals 1.94 molar.

00:08:02.719 --> 00:08:07.509
The concentration of hydrogen will be 1 - 0.968
or 0.032 molar.

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:12.979
And the concentration of fluorine will be
2 - 0.968 or 1.03 molar.

00:08:12.979 --> 00:08:16.669
As we learned last week, those values can
be shifted.

00:08:16.669 --> 00:08:21.680
For instance, to maximize the hydrogen fluoride production by adding or removing some of the substances.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.250
Or by changing the pressure or temperature
on the system.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:27.080
That's why these calculations are so valuable
to scientists.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.120
Just a little bit of algebra allows us to
maximize the benefit that we receive from

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.280
the things that nature is already doing anyway.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.980
If the universe really is try to take advantage of us, we've certainly figured out how to take advantage right back.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:41.600
So the next time you're wondering why you
learned this stuff in math class, now you know.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.820
Thanks for watching this episode of Crash
Course Chemistry.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:49.600

constant, Keq.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:57.320
