00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.453
The problem with the Painter's Algorithm is that you can get into cycles where

00:00:03.453 --> 00:00:06.850
each object is in front of the next. Here, the red triangle is in front of the

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.328
blue, which is in front of the yellow, which is in front of the red. There's no

00:00:10.328 --> 00:00:14.362
way to fully draw these objects in any order and produce the proper image. So,

00:00:14.362 --> 00:00:19.120
this is the only one that's impossible to draw. These others have a defined

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.753
order that is just fine.
