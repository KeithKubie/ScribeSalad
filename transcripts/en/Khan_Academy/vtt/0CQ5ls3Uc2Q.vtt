00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.570
- [Voiceover] In the video on the molecular structure of DNA

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.229
we saw that DNA is typically made up of two strands

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:11.030
where the backbone of each of the strands

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.010
is made up of phosphate alternating between a--

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.390
Do some different colors.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.110
A phosphate group and then you have a sugar.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:24.880
You have a phosphate group.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.660
And then you have a sugar.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.159
And then you have a phosphate group.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.470
And then you have a sugar.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.130
And so I could draw the strand something like this.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.320
So phosphate and then we have a sugar.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.850
Oops, let me just draw all the phosphates ahead of time.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.710
So you have the phosphates on that end

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.950
and then you have the sugars.

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.160
And you see the same thing on the other strand as well.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.660
Where we have

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.129
phosphate with a sugar

00:00:57.129 --> 00:00:59.120
then another phosphate then a sugar

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.850
then another phosphate.

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.860
Let me circle the sugars as well.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.360
So we have a sugar there

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.630
and then you have the sugar there as well.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.850
So on the other strand it's also going to look like this.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.420
So let me draw the phosphates.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.560
I'm just abstracting them now.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.750
So the phosphate and then you have the sugars

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.660
in between the phosphates.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.320
And what links them, you can think of them

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.000
as the rungs on the ladder.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.762
These are the complementary nitrogenous bases.

00:01:25.762 --> 00:01:27.730
And the reason why we call them nitrogenous bases,

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.600
I actually forgot to talk about it in the last videos,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.000
is that these nitrogens are really electronegative

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.990
and they can take up more hydrogen protons.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.100
They have an extra lone pair.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.200
The nitrogens have an extra lone pair

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.830
that can be used up under the right conditions

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.690
to potentially sop up more hydrogen protons.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.590
Now, a lot of people ask,

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.060
"Well, if you have these nitrogenous bases here,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.500
"why is DNA called an acid?"

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.120
Why is it called an acid?"

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.620
Well the first thing is that the basic properties

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.700
of the nitrogenous base are offset to a good degree

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.010
based on the fact that they're able

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.420
to hydrogen bond with each other.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.960
And that's what actually forms

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.660
the rungs of the ladder

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.590
when these complimentary nitrogenous bases

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.670
form these hydrogen bonds with each other.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.980
But even more, the reason why we call it an acid

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.220
is the phosphate groups, when they're protonated, are acids.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.750
Now the reason why we tend to draw them deprotonated

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.660
is they're so acidic that if you put them in a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.160
neutral solution, they're going to be deprotonated.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.180
So this is the form that you're more likely

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.520
to find it in the nucleus of an actual cell.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.557
Once it's actually already deprotonated.

00:02:33.557 --> 00:02:36.590
But in general, phosphate groups are considered acidic.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.100
And if I were to draw kind of a more pure phosphate group,

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.250
and I talked about this already in the last video,

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.763
I would have it protonated and so I wouldn't

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:46.070
draw that negative charge like that.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.990
So that's just a review of last time.

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.860
Since I already started abstracting it,

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.420
let's abstract further.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.490
So let's draw the nitrogenous bases a little bit.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.600
So I have thymine here.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.760
And I will do thymine in this green color.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.260
So this right over there is thymine.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.500
So this is attached to thymine.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.060
And the complementary nitrogenous base

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.680
to thymine is adenine.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.778
Which I will do--

00:03:19.778 --> 00:03:21.720
Let's see I'm running out of colors here.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.860
Let's see. Adenine.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.430
I'll do this in an orange color

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.100
since it's got so many nitrogens on it.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.740
So actually should include that hydrogen right over there.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.380
So this right over here is adenine.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.390
Now they have these hydrogen bonds

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.820
between them right over here.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.000
Because they have partially negative and positive charges

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.070
on either end that are attracted to each other.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.130
And then we go to this rung, one rung below it.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.860
And what is going on?

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.810
Well, let's see we have--

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.770
Now I really am running out of colors here.

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.313
We have this nitrogenous base is cytosine.

00:03:58.913 --> 00:04:02.510
This nitrogenous base right over here is cytosine.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.180
This nitrogenous base here is cytosine.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.230
And it is paired up with guanine.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.690
It is paired up with guanine.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.820
I'll do guanine in this color.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.490
So it is paired up

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.620
with guanine right over there.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.190
And we even saw this in the introductory video to DNA.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.340
Now you might say, "Oh look, these two strands

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.010
"seem parallel to each other."

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.602
And in some ways that is true.

00:04:31.602 --> 00:04:33.500
But there might be another

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.220
interesting thing that you might have noticed,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.990
is the direction in which they are oriented.

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.020
I guess is the best way to phrase it.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.720
And you especially see that when you focus in on the sugars.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.760
Notice the sugars over here, the deoxyriboses

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.160
or the parts of the nucleotide that come from deoxyribose.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.060
You see the oxygens on the top of the ribose,

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.560
on the top of these five member rings.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.030
The oxygen is on top.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.020
Well on this side, the oxygen is on the bottom.

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.060
And so they're actually in different orientations.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.560
Here the oxygen is pointing up,

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.850
here the oxygen is pointing down.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.330
And to get a little bit more concrete about that.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.490
We can number the carbons on the ribose

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.530
to think about the directions

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.320
and use those numbers of the carbons

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.930
to describe the different directions.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.980
So let's number our carbons.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.820
So these are both ribose,

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.530
we saw that in the molecular structure of DNA videos.

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.370
When we're talking about DNA

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.300
we're talking about deoxyribose.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.530
Instead of having a hydroxyl group

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.250
on the number two carbon, it just has a hydrogen.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.730
So instead of having a hydroxyl group

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.430
on the number two carbon, it just has a hydrogen.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.990
But let's actually number them.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.750
So this is the one prime carbon

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:57.250
starting at the carbonyl group.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.860
Let me do that in a different color.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.100
So this is the one prime carbon.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.850
And I'm just numbering them starting at the carbonyl group.

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:06.220
One prime. Two prime.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.710
Three prime. Four prime.

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.900
Five prime.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.590
And then when you look at it as a ring,

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.200
this was the one prime.

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.760
This is the two prime.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.390
This is the three prime.

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.900
This is the four prime.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.590
This is the five prime.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:20.970
Or if you were to number them

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:22.760
on this diagram right over here,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.480
actually in the DNA molecule,

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.200
this is the one prime.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:28.060
This is the two prime carbon.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:30.060
This is the three prime carbon.

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.960
This is the four prime carbon.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.690
And this is the five prime carbon.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.530
And so one way to think about it is

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.010
we'll go phosphate group and it's connected with

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.560
what we call phosphodiester linkages.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.260
Phosphodiester linkages, that's what's essentially

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.340
allowing these backbones to link up.

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.260
But we're going from phosphate to five prime carbon

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.000
and then through the sugar we go to the three prime carbon.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.330
And then we go to another phosphate.

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.960
Then we go to the five prime carbon.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.090
Let me label that, this is the five prime carbon.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.890
Then we go to the three prime carbon.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.790
And that just comes straight out of just numbering these

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:08.600
starting with the carbon that was a number one carbon.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.030
When it's straight chain form,

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.360
it's part of the carbonyl group.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.860
But you see we're going from five.

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.320
We go phosphate, five prime, three prime,

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:18.780
phosphate, five prime, three prime, phosphate.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.630
So one way to describe the orientation is saying,

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:21.990
"Hey, we're going in the direction

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.120
"from five prime to three prime."

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.060
So we could say that we're going from

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.530
five prime to three prime,

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:34.650
that way on the left-hand chain.

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:36.760
And what are we doing on the right hand chain?

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.490
Well, let's number them again.

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.400
So this is the one prime carbon.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.920
Now this thing relative to this

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.660
is upside down, it's inverted.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.860
So one prime. Two prime.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.120
Three prime. Four prime.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.410
Five prime.

00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:51.360
I could do it up here.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.300
One prime carbon. Two prime carbon.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.260
Three prime carbon.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.520
Four prime carbon. Five prime carbon.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.360
Here you're going from phosphate,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.120
three prime, five prime, phosphate,

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:05.060
three prime, five prime, phosphate.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.930
So the way that the sugars are oriented

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:08.060
if you're going from top to bottom

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:08.830
the way we're looking here,

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:10.970
you're going from three prime to five prime.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.460
So on the right hand side,

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:16.050
it's three prime, five prime.

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:17.170
And so if you wanted to draw an arrow

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.300
from five prime to three prime,

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:20.271
you could look at it like that.

00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:21.920
And so you could say these are parallel

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.150
but since they are essentially

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.790
pointing in different directions

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:27.390
even though they are actually parallel,

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:31.400
we would call this structure of DNA antiparallel.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.200
So this would be an anti...

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.400
antiparallel structure of DNA.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.120
So these two strands, they're complementary.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.590
They're defined by each other.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:44.590
The thymine bonds with the adenine,

00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:46.990
the cytosine bonds with guanine.

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:49.520
They are attracted to each other

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.060
through these hydrogen bonds.

00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.670
But the two backbones,

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.050
they're pointed in different directions.

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.990
And now another interesting thing to think about,

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.190
since we're talking about the molecular structure of DNA,

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:00.130
is how do these things form?

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.664
How did these things know to orient in this way?

00:09:03.664 --> 00:09:06.220
What plays part of that role

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.420
is the fact that these phosphate groups are negative.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.490
So you think these things that have

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:10.810
outright negative charge,

00:09:10.810 --> 00:09:12.230
they're gonna try to get as far away

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:13.930
from each other as possible.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.230
And then when they just keep kind of orienting

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.690
and getting far away from each other.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:18.620
And these are long.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:21.120
These are very, very, very, very long molecules.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.673
In the introductory video to DNA

00:09:22.673 --> 00:09:25.494
we talk about how long these chromosomes are,

00:09:25.494 --> 00:09:27.200
how many base pairs we actually have.

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.200
And these are long molecules.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:29.760
So all of these phosphate groups on either strand,

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.660
they want to get away from each other.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.950
And then these things want to get close to each other

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:36.150
because of the hydrogen bonds.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:40.179
And so that's what helps form this actual ladder structure.

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:42.520
So DNA, fascinating molecule,

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.929
we could speak for days about it.

00:09:43.929 --> 00:09:45.370
It's actually mind blowing when you

00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.960
think about its implications for who we are.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.160
But hopefully this gives you a better sense

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:53.390
of what it is molecularl-aly. molecularl-aly.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.819
I cannot say it. Molecularly.
