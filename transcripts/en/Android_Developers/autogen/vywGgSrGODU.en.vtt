outdoor applications such as directions
 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.830
outdoor applications such as directions
and specially directions in traffic we

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840
and specially directions in traffic we
 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.510
and specially directions in traffic we
could use higher accuracy than we have

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520
could use higher accuracy than we have
 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.370
could use higher accuracy than we have
now for example when you came here this

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:02.380
now for example when you came here this
 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.710
now for example when you came here this
morning in a car you probably had the

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720
morning in a car you probably had the
 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.470
morning in a car you probably had the
time estimated by the average traffic

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480
time estimated by the average traffic
 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.110

speed what you really want is the

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120
speed what you really want is the
 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.820
speed what you really want is the
traffic speed in the lane that you're in

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830
traffic speed in the lane that you're in
 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.680
traffic speed in the lane that you're in
so that you could ask how fast would it

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690
so that you could ask how fast would it
 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.500
so that you could ask how fast would it
be if I could take the carpool lane they

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510
be if I could take the carpool lane they
 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.810
be if I could take the carpool lane they
of course many other use cases and I'll

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820
of course many other use cases and I'll
 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.670
of course many other use cases and I'll
mention a few before we finish

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680
mention a few before we finish
 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.620
mention a few before we finish
but the important thing is that we are

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630
but the important thing is that we are
 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.750
but the important thing is that we are
sure that you will have many more ideas

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760
sure that you will have many more ideas
 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.260

and the thing to think about thank you

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300
 
 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.240
 
the thing to think about here is that if

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:29.250
the thing to think about here is that if
 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.280
the thing to think about here is that if
you didn't have 1 to 2 meter accuracy

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290
you didn't have 1 to 2 meter accuracy
 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:35.120
you didn't have 1 to 2 meter accuracy
then when that system rerouted it would

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130
then when that system rerouted it would
 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.010
then when that system rerouted it would
jump potentially between aisles that

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020
jump potentially between aisles that
 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.300
jump potentially between aisles that
were surrounding me and it would be a

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310
were surrounding me and it would be a
 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.250
were surrounding me and it would be a
terrible user experience so that's why

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260
terrible user experience so that's why
 

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.960
terrible user experience so that's why
it's so important to have this kind of

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970
it's so important to have this kind of
 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.800
it's so important to have this kind of
accuracy so before I get into the

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:45.810
accuracy so before I get into the
 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.650
accuracy so before I get into the
details of a Wi-Fi RTT I want to tell

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:48.660
details of a Wi-Fi RTT I want to tell
 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.570
details of a Wi-Fi RTT I want to tell
you about how we calculate location

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580
you about how we calculate location
 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.800
you about how we calculate location
indoors now we use Wi-Fi RSSI which

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:54.810
indoors now we use Wi-Fi RSSI which
 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:56.480
indoors now we use Wi-Fi RSSI which
stands for received strict signal

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.490
stands for received strict signal
 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.900
stands for received strict signal
strength

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910
strength
 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.420
strength
indication and basically we can

00:06:59.420 --> 00:06:59.430
indication and basically we can
 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.370
indication and basically we can
calculate distance as a function of

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:01.380
calculate distance as a function of
 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:03.470
calculate distance as a function of
signal strength now the figure that you

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.480
signal strength now the figure that you
 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.870
signal strength now the figure that you
see on the left-hand side here the

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880
see on the left-hand side here the
 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.030
see on the left-hand side here the
access point which is in the center has

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:08.040
access point which is in the center has
 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.940
access point which is in the center has
a heat map of signal strength the green

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:10.950
a heat map of signal strength the green
 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:13.460
a heat map of signal strength the green
is the strongest and the red is the

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:13.470
is the strongest and the red is the
 

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.830
is the strongest and the red is the
weakest at the edges and I've placed two

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840
weakest at the edges and I've placed two
 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.470
weakest at the edges and I've placed two
phones on this diagram at the transition

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:18.480
phones on this diagram at the transition
 

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.770
phones on this diagram at the transition
between the weak and the strong

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:20.780
between the weak and the strong
 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.780
between the weak and the strong
notice that the phone on the right is

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:23.790
notice that the phone on the right is
 

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:25.490
notice that the phone on the right is
further away from the access point than

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:25.500
further away from the access point than
 

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.550
further away from the access point than
the phone on the left so say the signal

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560
the phone on the left so say the signal
 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:30.260
the phone on the left so say the signal
strength different distance and it's

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:30.270
strength different distance and it's
 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.510
strength different distance and it's
this variability in distance for signal

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:32.520
this variability in distance for signal
 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.100
this variability in distance for signal
strengths that unfortunately makes it

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.110
strengths that unfortunately makes it
 

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:38.150
strengths that unfortunately makes it
very hard to get accurate our readings

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160
very hard to get accurate our readings
 

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.400

00:11:22.939 --> 00:11:25.299
burst in Android we're typically doing a
burst of about eight of these of these

00:11:25.299 --> 00:11:25.309
burst of about eight of these of these
 

00:11:25.309 --> 00:11:28.660
burst of about eight of these of these
events and as a consequence the system

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:28.670
events and as a consequence the system
 

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.780

can calculate statistics so the mean and

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:31.790
can calculate statistics so the mean and
 

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.210
can calculate statistics so the mean and
the variance which allows us to more

00:11:34.210 --> 00:11:34.220
the variance which allows us to more
 

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:36.850
the variance which allows us to more
accurately plot a position on a map and

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:36.860
accurately plot a position on a map and
 

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.220
accurately plot a position on a map and
knowing the accuracy also allows us to

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:39.230
knowing the accuracy also allows us to
 

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:44.139
knowing the accuracy also allows us to
calculate a path miraculous well so now

00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:44.149
calculate a path miraculous well so now
 

00:11:44.149 --> 00:11:46.569
calculate a path miraculous well so now
you have ranges how do you get a

00:11:46.569 --> 00:11:46.579
you have ranges how do you get a
 

00:11:46.579 --> 00:11:48.220
you have ranges how do you get a
position so I just want to give you a

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:48.230
position so I just want to give you a
 

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:50.439

feel for how you go about doing this now

00:11:50.439 --> 00:11:50.449
feel for how you go about doing this now
 

00:11:50.449 --> 00:11:52.179
feel for how you go about doing this now
there's lots of different mathematical

00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:52.189
there's lots of different mathematical
 

00:11:52.189 --> 00:11:54.160
there's lots of different mathematical
approaches and I'm just picking one

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:54.170
approaches and I'm just picking one
 

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:55.960
approaches and I'm just picking one
because it's relatively easy to explain

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:55.970
because it's relatively easy to explain
 

00:11:55.970 --> 00:11:57.220
because it's relatively easy to explain
but this is where the power of

but this is where the power of
 

00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:59.470

developers comes in for you to figure

00:11:59.470 --> 00:11:59.480
developers comes in for you to figure
 

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:01.929
developers comes in for you to figure
out your own own way to do it so if you

00:12:01.929 --> 00:12:01.939
out your own own way to do it so if you
 

00:12:01.939 --> 00:12:04.239
out your own own way to do it so if you
know a phone is at a certain range from

00:12:04.239 --> 00:12:04.249
know a phone is at a certain range from
 

00:12:04.249 --> 00:12:06.579
know a phone is at a certain range from
an access point that tells you that it

00:12:06.579 --> 00:12:06.589
an access point that tells you that it
 

00:12:06.589 --> 00:12:08.679
an access point that tells you that it
can be anywhere on the circumference of

00:12:08.679 --> 00:12:08.689
can be anywhere on the circumference of
 

00:12:08.689 --> 00:12:10.720
can be anywhere on the circumference of
a circle of that radius that radius R

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:10.730
a circle of that radius that radius R
 

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:14.230
a circle of that radius that radius R
and I've written the circle equation for

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240
and I've written the circle equation for
 

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.210
and I've written the circle equation for
that circumference on the right hand

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:16.220
that circumference on the right hand
 

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.230
that circumference on the right hand
side that center x1y1 now if you want to

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240
side that center x1y1 now if you want to
 

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.699

find a position you've got to constrain

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:21.709
find a position you've got to constrain
 

00:12:21.709 --> 00:12:24.340
find a position you've got to constrain
it so if you take four ranges to four

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:24.350
it so if you take four ranges to four
 

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:26.109
it so if you take four ranges to four
separate access points as I've shown on

00:12:26.109 --> 00:12:26.119
separate access points as I've shown on
 

00:12:26.119 --> 00:12:28.600
separate access points as I've shown on
the diagram on the right hand side you

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:28.610
the diagram on the right hand side you
 

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:30.460
the diagram on the right hand side you
then can see that if those ranges were

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:30.470
then can see that if those ranges were
 

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:32.319
then can see that if those ranges were
accurate those circles would intersect

00:12:32.319 --> 00:12:32.329
accurate those circles would intersect
 

00:12:32.329 --> 00:12:34.600
accurate those circles would intersect
at a single point how do you find that

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:34.610
at a single point how do you find that
 

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:36.549

point programmatically well if you write

00:12:36.549 --> 00:12:36.559
point programmatically well if you write
 

00:12:36.559 --> 00:12:38.169
point programmatically well if you write
those four equations out on the left

00:12:38.169 --> 00:12:38.179
those four equations out on the left
 

00:12:38.179 --> 00:12:40.660
those four equations out on the left
hand side you see they're nasty circle

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:40.670

equations it may be difficult but in

00:12:43.569 --> 00:12:43.579
equations it may be difficult but in
 

00:12:43.579 --> 00:12:45.100
equations it may be difficult but in
fact it's actually very straightforward

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:45.110
fact it's actually very straightforward
 

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:46.989
fact it's actually very straightforward
you take you pick one of them you

00:12:46.989 --> 00:12:46.999
you take you pick one of them you
 

00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:48.579
you take you pick one of them you
subtract it from all the others and you

00:12:48.579 --> 00:12:48.589
subtract it from all the others and you
 

00:12:48.589 --> 00:12:50.259
subtract it from all the others and you
end up with a set of line equations the

00:12:50.259 --> 00:12:50.269
end up with a set of line equations the
 

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:52.900
end up with a set of line equations the
square terms disappear and those lines

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:52.910
square terms disappear and those lines
 

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:54.429
square terms disappear and those lines
are in fact drawn on this diagram as

00:12:54.429 --> 00:12:54.439
are in fact drawn on this diagram as
 

00:12:54.439 --> 00:12:56.289

well and then it's very easy to find out

00:12:56.289 --> 00:12:56.299
well and then it's very easy to find out
 

00:12:56.299 --> 00:12:57.730
well and then it's very easy to find out
where two lines intersect

00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:57.740
where two lines intersect
 

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:00.369
where two lines intersect
now there's one problem with what I've

00:13:00.369 --> 00:13:00.379
now there's one problem with what I've
 

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:02.610
now there's one problem with what I've
just told you and the problem is

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:02.620
just told you and the problem is
 

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:04.350
just told you and the problem is
that we're assuming the measurements are

00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:04.360
that we're assuming the measurements are
 

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.200
that we're assuming the measurements are
perfect in reality no measurements are

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:07.210
perfect in reality no measurements are
 

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.230
perfect in reality no measurements are
perfect everything has error and there

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240
perfect everything has error and there
 

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.240
perfect everything has error and there
will be no exact solution to that

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:12.250
will be no exact solution to that
 

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.730
will be no exact solution to that
equation so let me give you a more

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:14.740
equation so let me give you a more
 

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.980
equation so let me give you a more
realistic example so here we have

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:16.990
realistic example so here we have
 

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:19.530
realistic example so here we have
several access points which we've ranged

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:19.540
several access points which we've ranged
 

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:22.110
several access points which we've ranged
to and I've exaggerated the problem here

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.120
to and I've exaggerated the problem here
 

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.550
to and I've exaggerated the problem here
and you can see some of those circles

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:23.560
and you can see some of those circles
 

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.730
and you can see some of those circles
don't intersect how do you solve that

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:26.740
don't intersect how do you solve that
 

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:28.140
don't intersect how do you solve that
well in fact you do the same thing as

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:28.150
well in fact you do the same thing as
 

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:29.610
well in fact you do the same thing as
you did before you subtract the circles

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:29.620
you did before you subtract the circles
 

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.200
you did before you subtract the circles
so you get the lines but this time they

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:31.210
so you get the lines but this time they
 

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.730
so you get the lines but this time they
don't intersect in a point they

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:32.740
don't intersect in a point they
 

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:34.770
don't intersect in a point they
intersect in a polygon in this case it's

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:34.780
intersect in a polygon in this case it's
 

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:37.290
intersect in a polygon in this case it's
a it's a triangle and your phone lies

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:37.300
a it's a triangle and your phone lies
 

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:39.840
a it's a triangle and your phone lies
probably somewhere maximum-likelihood in

probably somewhere maximum-likelihood in
 

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.810
probably somewhere maximum-likelihood in
the center of that triangle and then we

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:42.820
the center of that triangle and then we
 

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:45.090
the center of that triangle and then we
can apply some college math least

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:45.100
can apply some college math least
 

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.280
can apply some college math least
squares solution and get a maximum

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:47.290
squares solution and get a maximum
 

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:48.570
squares solution and get a maximum
likelihood you can find standard

00:13:48.570 --> 00:13:48.580

packages which do this on the net you
 

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:53.970
packages which do this on the net you
can then also refine this position

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:53.980
can then also refine this position
 

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.380
can then also refine this position
further by repeating this process

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:55.390
further by repeating this process
 

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.870
further by repeating this process
particularly as the phone moves and then

00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:57.880
particularly as the phone moves and then
 

00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.130
particularly as the phone moves and then
you can calculate trajectory and use

00:13:59.130 --> 00:13:59.140
you can calculate trajectory and use
 

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:00.480
you can calculate trajectory and use

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:46.150
these things are algorithms which the
 

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.150
these things are algorithms which the
vendors are improving and and basically

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160
vendors are improving and and basically
 

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.440
vendors are improving and and basically
we need to go through a sort of teething

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:49.450
we need to go through a sort of teething
 

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:51.210
we need to go through a sort of teething
process of getting rid of these bugs and

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:51.220
process of getting rid of these bugs and
 

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.700
process of getting rid of these bugs and
Google can help in this process by

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:53.710
Google can help in this process by
 

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:56.180
Google can help in this process by
providing reference platforms and

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:56.190
providing reference platforms and
 

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.740
providing reference platforms and
reference applications so the vendors

00:14:58.740 --> 00:14:58.750
reference applications so the vendors
 

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.110
reference applications so the vendors
can calibrate their own platforms before

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120
can calibrate their own platforms before
 

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.060
can calibrate their own platforms before
you guys even get to use them which will

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:03.070
you guys even get to use them which will
 

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:06.420
you guys even get to use them which will
be the ideal situation now I've assumed

we expect you
to just use the fuse location provider

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:17.650
to just use the fuse location provider
 

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:18.960
to just use the fuse location provider
because we're going to be putting the

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:18.970
because we're going to be putting the
 

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.480
because we're going to be putting the
RTG capability into it so at the moment

okay so the one other thing to remember

00:15:45.810 --> 00:15:45.820
okay so the one other thing to remember
 

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.640
okay so the one other thing to remember
is that when you were doing it yourself

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:47.650
is that when you were doing it yourself
 

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.140
is that when you were doing it yourself
you had to know the position of the

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:49.150
you had to know the position of the
 

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:51.390
you had to know the position of the
access points in the fused location

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:51.400
access points in the fused location
 

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.430

provider we will know those positions

00:15:53.430 --> 00:15:53.440
provider we will know those positions
 

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:55.320
provider we will know those positions
automatically for you we'll crowdsource

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:55.330
automatically for you we'll crowdsource
 

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:57.420
automatically for you we'll crowdsource
those positions and so you won't have to

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:57.430
those positions and so you won't have to
 

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.440
those positions and so you won't have to
worry about that and that would make

00:15:58.440 --> 00:15:58.450
worry about that and that would make
 

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.380
worry about that and that would make
life a lot more a lot easier for you to

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:01.390
life a lot more a lot easier for you to
 

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.980
life a lot more a lot easier for you to
write applications okay so now we're

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:04.990
write applications okay so now we're
 

00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:06.420
write applications okay so now we're
going to take it up a notch and we're

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:06.430
going to take it up a notch and we're
 

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:08.790
going to take it up a notch and we're
going to give you a live RTG demo in

and and what I'm going to do is I'm

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:01.810
and and what I'm going to do is I'm
 

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:03.120
and and what I'm going to do is I'm
going to walk around the aisles and you

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:03.130
going to walk around the aisles and you
 

00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:04.920
going to walk around the aisles and you
can see on this car that I've already

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:04.930
can see on this car that I've already
 

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:08.370

got a plot of where anger to go so I'm

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:08.380
got a plot of where anger to go so I'm
 

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.900
got a plot of where anger to go so I'm
gonna start moving now and it's like

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:09.910
gonna start moving now and it's like
 

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:11.220

going towards the corner of the stage
 

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:15.540
going towards the corner of the stage
and you should see the blue dot with my

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:15.550
and you should see the blue dot with my
 

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:19.290
and you should see the blue dot with my
little man inside following me and we of

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:19.300
little man inside following me and we of
 

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.020

course we expect an accuracy of 1 to 2

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:22.030
course we expect an accuracy of 1 to 2
 

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:24.390
course we expect an accuracy of 1 to 2
meters and so I'm walking on the aisle

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400
meters and so I'm walking on the aisle
 

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.569
meters and so I'm walking on the aisle
the aisle here is about it's about two

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:27.579
the aisle here is about it's about two
 

00:17:27.579 --> 00:17:28.870
the aisle here is about it's about two
meters across

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880
meters across
 

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.610
meters across
there abouts and you can see it's very

00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:30.620
there abouts and you can see it's very
 

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:35.100
there abouts and you can see it's very
nicely following within that accuracy I

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:35.110
nicely following within that accuracy I
 

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:38.740
nicely following within that accuracy I
think the the demo environment has been

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:38.750
think the the demo environment has been
 

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.620
think the the demo environment has been
very good to us so far so we're going

00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:41.630
very good to us so far so we're going
 

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:47.800
very good to us so far so we're going
along and it's a little bit of lag it's

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:47.810
along and it's a little bit of lag it's
 

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:50.110
along and it's a little bit of lag it's
going around the back here and we're

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:50.120
going around the back here and we're
 

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.580
going around the back here and we're
approaching a turnaround point where I'm

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:54.590
approaching a turnaround point where I'm
 

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:58.240
approaching a turnaround point where I'm
going to walk up the aisle and we're

00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:58.250
going to walk up the aisle and we're
 

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:01.390
going to walk up the aisle and we're
rerouting as I come back to make my path

00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:01.400
rerouting as I come back to make my path
 

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.060
rerouting as I come back to make my path
a little bit shorter and you can see

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:04.070
a little bit shorter and you can see
 

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:05.560
a little bit shorter and you can see
we're going very nicely it's still well

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:05.570
we're going very nicely it's still well
 

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.890
we're going very nicely it's still well
within the one to two meters and if you

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:08.900
within the one to two meters and if you
 

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:12.340
within the one to two meters and if you
had GPS shown here as well I mean

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:12.350
had GPS shown here as well I mean
 

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:14.260
had GPS shown here as well I mean
typically you would be expecting to see

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:14.270
typically you would be expecting to see
 

00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:16.360
typically you would be expecting to see
five meters but that's accruals outdoors

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:16.370
five meters but that's accruals outdoors
 

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.760
five meters but that's accruals outdoors
and indoors in a typical building you've

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:18.770
and indoors in a typical building you've
 

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.310
and indoors in a typical building you've
only gone it you're only going to have

00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320
only gone it you're only going to have
 

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.930
only gone it you're only going to have
indoor location technology such as this

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:22.940
indoor location technology such as this

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:22.980
through space and arrives at you and
 

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:25.460
through space and arrives at you and
your GPS receiver will compare that time

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:25.470
your GPS receiver will compare that time
 

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:27.200
your GPS receiver will compare that time
with the time in its clock the

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:27.210
with the time in its clock the
 

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:28.610
with the time in its clock the
difference between those two tells you

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:28.620
difference between those two tells you
 

00:23:28.620 --> 00:23:31.039
difference between those two tells you
how far you are away it's kind of like

00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:31.049
how far you are away it's kind of like
 

00:23:31.049 --> 00:23:33.590
how far you are away it's kind of like
you have a tape measure where one ends

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600
you have a tape measure where one ends
 

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:38.930
you have a tape measure where one ends
at the satellite and you're holding the

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:38.940
at the satellite and you're holding the
 

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.760
at the satellite and you're holding the
school at any moment you can look down

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:40.770
school at any moment you can look down
 

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.200
school at any moment you can look down
and read a number which is the

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:42.210
and read a number which is the
 

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:43.970
and read a number which is the
difference in these two times if you

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:43.980
difference in these two times if you
 

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.860
difference in these two times if you
move further away you read a bigger

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:45.870
move further away you read a bigger
 

00:23:45.870 --> 00:23:47.630
move further away you read a bigger
number do you move a little bit closer

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640
number do you move a little bit closer
 

00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.930
number do you move a little bit closer
you read a smaller number okay

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:50.940
you read a smaller number okay
 

00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:53.000
you read a smaller number okay
but now the actual GPS tape measure is

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:53.010
but now the actual GPS tape measure is
 

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:55.070
but now the actual GPS tape measure is
kind of special first of all it's really

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080
kind of special first of all it's really
 

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:55.779
kind of special first of all it's really
long

00:23:55.779 --> 00:23:55.789
long
 

00:23:55.789 --> 00:24:00.020
long
secondly the tick marks occur only every

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:00.030
secondly the tick marks occur only every
 

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:03.860
secondly the tick marks occur only every
300 meters because these bits of the

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:03.870
300 meters because these bits of the
 

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.590
300 meters because these bits of the
code occur at a rate of one microsecond

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:06.600
code occur at a rate of one microsecond
 

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.149
code occur at a rate of one microsecond
so one microsecond times the speed of

00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159
so one microsecond times the speed of
 

00:24:08.159 --> 00:24:10.850
so one microsecond times the speed of
light is about 300 meters so this is

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:10.860
light is about 300 meters so this is
 

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:13.159
light is about 300 meters so this is
like a tape measure where instead of

00:24:13.159 --> 00:24:13.169
like a tape measure where instead of
 

00:24:13.169 --> 00:24:14.960
like a tape measure where instead of
having all these inches on here you only

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:14.970
having all these inches on here you only
 

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:18.500
having all these inches on here you only
have a mark every 300 meters and your

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:18.510
have a mark every 300 meters and your
 

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.110
have a mark every 300 meters and your
GPS receiver essentially interpolates

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120
GPS receiver essentially interpolates
 

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.880
GPS receiver essentially interpolates
between those marks and there's your

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:22.890
between those marks and there's your
 

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:27.049
between those marks and there's your
five meter accuracy okay but there's

00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:27.059
five meter accuracy okay but there's
 

00:24:27.059 --> 00:24:27.830
five meter accuracy okay but there's
more to it than that

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840
more to it than that
 

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.740
more to it than that
because how does that code get through

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:30.750
because how does that code get through
 

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.779
because how does that code get through
space in the first place well it's

00:24:32.779 --> 00:24:32.789
space in the first place well it's
 

00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:35.899
space in the first place well it's
carried on a carrier wave radio wave

00:24:35.899 --> 00:24:35.909
carried on a carrier wave radio wave
 

00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:38.930
carried on a carrier wave radio wave
which for GPS has a wavelength that is

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:38.940
which for GPS has a wavelength that is
 

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:42.409
which for GPS has a wavelength that is
less than twenty centimeters and your

00:24:42.409 --> 00:24:42.419
less than twenty centimeters and your
 

00:24:42.419 --> 00:24:45.320
less than twenty centimeters and your
GPS receiver can measure where you are

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:45.330
GPS receiver can measure where you are
 

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:46.940
GPS receiver can measure where you are
on this wave and as long as it keeps

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:46.950
on this wave and as long as it keeps
 

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:49.909
on this wave and as long as it keeps
tracking it can measure relative motion

00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919
tracking it can measure relative motion
 

00:24:49.919 --> 00:24:54.080
tracking it can measure relative motion
with great precision and this is because

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:54.090
with great precision and this is because
 

00:24:54.090 --> 00:24:56.480
with great precision and this is because
it the receiver will measure the face

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:56.490
it the receiver will measure the face
 

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:58.480
it the receiver will measure the face
and as you move that phase will change

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:58.490
and as you move that phase will change
 

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:01.460
and as you move that phase will change
but now what about getting your absolute

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:01.470
but now what about getting your absolute
 

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:04.100
but now what about getting your absolute
location the trouble with the carrier

phase ruler if you like is that it's

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.020
phase ruler if you like is that it's
 

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.140
phase ruler if you like is that it's
it's kind of like a ruler with very

00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:09.150
it's kind of like a ruler with very
 

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:11.390
it's kind of like a ruler with very
precise markings on it but no numbers at

00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:11.400
precise markings on it but no numbers at
 

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.700
precise markings on it but no numbers at
all because one wavelength looks just

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:13.710
all because one wavelength looks just
 

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:16.070
all because one wavelength looks just
like the next so your your receiver can

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080
like the next so your your receiver can
 

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.660
like the next so your your receiver can
tell you the phase of the wave you're on

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:17.670
tell you the phase of the wave you're on
 

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:19.370
tell you the phase of the wave you're on
but it doesn't know are you the green

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:19.380
but it doesn't know are you the green
 

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.980
but it doesn't know are you the green
dot or the red dot so how do you solve

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:21.990
dot or the red dot so how do you solve
 

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:23.750
dot or the red dot so how do you solve
that problem well for that you need to

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760
that problem well for that you need to
 

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.560
that problem well for that you need to
introduce a new concept which is GPS

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:27.570
introduce a new concept which is GPS
 

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:30.170
introduce a new concept which is GPS

communicate that data to you with
 

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.230
communicate that data to you with
well-known algorithms you can combine

you can work out where you are relative

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:44.580
you can work out where you are relative
 

00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.250
you can work out where you are relative
to the reference station with great

precision now you know where the

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320
precision now you know where the
 

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.960

if you introduce a second wave at a
different frequency immediately you can

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:57.210
different frequency immediately you can
 

00:26:57.210 --> 00:27:00.050
different frequency immediately you can
disambiguate because you could not have

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:00.060
disambiguate because you could not have
 

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:04.040
disambiguate because you could not have
the same phase on that second wave as on

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:04.050
the same phase on that second wave as on
 

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.450
the same phase on that second wave as on
both of those wavelengths so you could

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:05.460
both of those wavelengths so you could
 

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:07.250
both of those wavelengths so you could
not be on the red dot if you're at the

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:07.260
not be on the red dot if you're at the
 

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:07.970
not be on the red dot if you're at the
