00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.202
Opposers, this can't wait.

00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:05.171
The Opposition's
very own Kobi Libii

00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:07.540
has confronted
a potential crisis actor

00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:10.643
posing as the real Alex Jones
in Washington D.C..

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:21.087
On Sandy Hook

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.689
and all the people that look
and act like actors.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:28.594
You look at
the Aurora shooting

00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:30.063
that was totally staged.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:39.506
And they may actually even have
some experience in uh, you know
acting.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:52.852
Now I want to be clear,
we didn't call

00:00:52.885 --> 00:00:56.289
this Alex Jones crisis actor
"a crisis actor".

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:58.224
We merely looked
at the crisis actor

00:00:58.257 --> 00:01:00.993
like-behavior of
this crisis actor like man

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:02.762
speaking from
what felt like a script

00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:06.533
and said others might say
"Alex Jones is a crisis actor".

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:11.571
Besides, that sad sorry man
looks nothing like the real A.J.

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:13.539
I'm supposed to believe
that guy gave advice

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:15.708
to the President
of the United States?

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:18.344
No way. Sad.

00:01:22.281 --> 00:01:23.616
The fight continues.

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.052
You, are you a deep state
operative who's sent by George
Soros

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:27.520
to take away my
Second Amendment rights

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:29.222
to force feed me soy burgers?

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.824
No? Well then prove it.
