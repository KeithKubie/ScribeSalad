00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.940
Figuring out weather your crush likes you is one of the hardest things to figure out

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.340
Because when it comes to attraction, things are usually kept pretty subtle

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.075
You have to look pretty close, if you want to see the signs that someone likes you

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.980
Here's what to keep an eye out for

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.635
1. They respond to the sound of your voice

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:22.675
The sound of your voice can seriously attract other people

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.060
Many studies have found that women are attracted to deeper voices in men

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.600
Whereas men like higher voices in women

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.995
Fast talkers are seen as seen as more educated

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.925
And if you can change up your inflection,

00:00:33.925 --> 00:00:36.400
you are seen as more interesting

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.660
Your crush might be in love with the sound of your voice,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.900
so keep an eye out to see if they are responding to your voice with a smile or a laugh

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.380
If this is the case, there might be a spark of attraction

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.600
2. They play hard to get

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.280
The rumours are true, playing hard to get is a big sign of attraction

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.380
When we're with someone who's playing hard to get, we usually work that much harder to get their attention

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.540
and that makes the seduction process much more intense

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.700
This all comes down to one thing,

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.840
availability

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.180
Appearing to be less available can make people want you even more

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.300
3. Uncrossed legs

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.060
Body language also reveals alot about availability

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.500
For example, when someone uncrosses their legs and arms,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.780
they are basically saying; I'm available

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.000
This is a basic body language in both men and women

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.600
So this rule also applies to same sex couples

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.260
There are plenty of other signs of open body language

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.240
such as unturned palms, maintaining eye contact, and many more

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.555
4. They talk about being single

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.200
Let's stick on the topic of availability

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.000
because its such a huge factor in attraction

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.760
When someone suddenly drops a hint of being single,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.040
its a great sign

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.740
So if someone suddenly mentions that they're single, maybe its the right time to make a move

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.760
Because who knows, they might be sending out signals of availability, as a sign of attraction

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.700
5. Leaning in

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.880
A 2014 study, identified 5 seperate flirting styles

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.380
and leaning in was a huge sign of attraction that was mentioned

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.740
They specified that leaning in on an angle from the hip is a big sign of flirting

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.620
So if your crush is leaning into you after you make them laugh,

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.820
it could be a major sign of attraction

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.560
so keep an eye out for that

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.075
6. Revealing personal info

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.660
As a general rule, the more personal info a person reveals,

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.580
the more interested they are in you

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.920
That's what a recent study found , when they studies flirting techniques

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.755
this can still be done in a subtle way

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.960
for example, someone might reveal that they are dealing with a hardbreaking loss or a major setback

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.120
but in a slightly casual way

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.480
7. Teasing

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.540
In that same study, the researchers also studied the signs of flirting that might arise during a conversation

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.900
and teasing was a big part of that

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.540
They specified that teasing consisted of making fun of another person in a light-hearted way

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.740
We're guessing that alot of our viewers have probably experienced teasing in their own flirting experiences

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.440
but remember: Keep teasing light-hearted and fun

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.420
Never make fun of someone for things they are insecure about

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.680
No matter how much you're crushing on them

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.040
8. Eye pupils and dilation are linked with arousal

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.240
We all know that eyes are windows to the soul

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.860
but if you stare deep enough into your crush's eyes

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.000
you might just get a clue as to weather they are into you

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.680
Studies have shown, that when people become aroused,

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.520
their pupils actually DILATE

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.540
This is actually a pretty good sign of sexual orientation as well

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.100
Your eyes will dilate when you look at the gender you are most attracted to

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.060
9. Playing with nearby objects

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.620
When some people get nervous, they fidget

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.100
They might play with their hair, their bracelets, or their nails

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.140
But according to a recent study,

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.940
those same behaviors might be linked with attraction

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.240
researchers found, that people that are flirting often found themselves playing

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.500
with buttons on their shirts, zippers, strings and many other nearby objects

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.560
10. Mirroring

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.660
Another big sign of attraction, is mirroring

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.880
if you look closely, you might find that your crush seems to be copying your movements 
&amp; behaviors in a subtle way

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.600
it might be tilting their head to the side in the same way as you

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.780
or adopting a similar posture

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.680
Mirroring has been studied quite intensively in psychological research

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.780
Which of these signs do you find interesting and believable?
