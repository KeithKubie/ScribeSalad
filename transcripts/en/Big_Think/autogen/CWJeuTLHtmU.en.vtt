it's always a that's a very important

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589
it's always a that's a very important
 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.160
it's always a that's a very important
question because you have to learn to

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170
question because you have to learn to
 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.930
question because you have to learn to
love whatever you do like in the

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940
love whatever you do like in the
 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.430
love whatever you do like in the
failures as much as the successes

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440
failures as much as the successes
 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.110
failures as much as the successes
because they'll probably be a lot more

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120
because they'll probably be a lot more
 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.030
because they'll probably be a lot more
failures and successes and so that's a

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040
failures and successes and so that's a
 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.560
failures and successes and so that's a
very important lesson to learn early on

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570
very important lesson to learn early on
 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.029
very important lesson to learn early on
and I learned it early in my career

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039
and I learned it early in my career
 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.130
and I learned it early in my career
because my PhD really got off to a

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140
because my PhD really got off to a
 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.439
because my PhD really got off to a
pretty poor start and so there's a long

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449
pretty poor start and so there's a long
 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.730
pretty poor start and so there's a long
period of time where I had to say is

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740
period of time where I had to say is
 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.920
period of time where I had to say is
this worth it and many of my friends are

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930
this worth it and many of my friends are
 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.330
this worth it and many of my friends are
just sort of saying like you you know

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340
just sort of saying like you you know
 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.560
just sort of saying like you you know
you're already accepted into Medical

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570
you're already accepted into Medical
 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.660
you're already accepted into Medical
School why do you even need this and I

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670
School why do you even need this and I
 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.970
School why do you even need this and I
think I was just really like it's the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980
think I was just really like it's the
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.130
think I was just really like it's the
the puzzle that I was sort of trying to

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140
the puzzle that I was sort of trying to
 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.229
the puzzle that I was sort of trying to
figure out was just it compelling enough

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239
figure out was just it compelling enough
 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.850
figure out was just it compelling enough
to me that I kept going with it so I

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860
to me that I kept going with it so I
 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.650
to me that I kept going with it so I
think in science you have to be very

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
think in science you have to be very
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.959
think in science you have to be very
patient you have to enjoy like the the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969
patient you have to enjoy like the the
 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.060
patient you have to enjoy like the the
process and it's nice to think about

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070
process and it's nice to think about
 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.889
process and it's nice to think about
where the process will take you but it's

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899
where the process will take you but it's
 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.750
where the process will take you but it's
important to enjoy like each aspect of

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760
important to enjoy like each aspect of
 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.830
important to enjoy like each aspect of
the process itself and so I think that

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
the process itself and so I think that
 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.939
the process itself and so I think that
we're lucky because we're in a time

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949
we're lucky because we're in a time
 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.260
we're lucky because we're in a time
right now that there are so many tools

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270
right now that there are so many tools
 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.700
right now that there are so many tools
available that there are many

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710
available that there are many
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.979
available that there are many
discoveries being made so you know

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
discoveries being made so you know
 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.209
discoveries being made so you know
there's just many opportunities to

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219
there's just many opportunities to
 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.099
there's just many opportunities to
advance the field and it's coming from

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109
advance the field and it's coming from
 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.439
advance the field and it's coming from
all directions so that's a lucky time

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449
all directions so that's a lucky time
 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.609
all directions so that's a lucky time
but obviously there will be droughts

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619
but obviously there will be droughts
 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.590
but obviously there will be droughts
where we figured we've kind of you know

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600
where we figured we've kind of you know
 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.240
where we figured we've kind of you know
tapped the genome to its full potential

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250
tapped the genome to its full potential
 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.160
tapped the genome to its full potential
and looking for the next thing and the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170
and looking for the next thing and the
 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.080
and looking for the next thing and the
difficulties with each aspect of you

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090
difficulties with each aspect of you
 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.210
difficulties with each aspect of you
know changing paradigms so though there

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220
know changing paradigms so though there
 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.770
know changing paradigms so though there
will be periods I've already you know

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780
will be periods I've already you know
 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.749
will be periods I've already you know
experienced some maybe not like the

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759
experienced some maybe not like the
 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.010
experienced some maybe not like the
biggest I could experience but it

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020
biggest I could experience but it
 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.620
biggest I could experience but it
definitely experienced long periods of

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630
definitely experienced long periods of
 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.050
definitely experienced long periods of
failed work and I just I still enjoy it

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060
failed work and I just I still enjoy it
 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.570
failed work and I just I still enjoy it
I just enjoy the day-to-day and that's

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580
I just enjoy the day-to-day and that's
 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.149
I just enjoy the day-to-day and that's
important I love teaching

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159
important I love teaching
 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.609
important I love teaching
yeah that's one of the reasons why I

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
yeah that's one of the reasons why I
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.819
yeah that's one of the reasons why I
didn't look at I looked at being on an

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829
didn't look at I looked at being on an
 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.410
didn't look at I looked at being on an
undergraduate campus because I really

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
undergraduate campus because I really
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.120
undergraduate campus because I really
enjoy teaching I think it's I think it's

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
enjoy teaching I think it's I think it's
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.530
enjoy teaching I think it's I think it's
wonderful and you're very lucky to be

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540
wonderful and you're very lucky to be
 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.960
wonderful and you're very lucky to be
with such I mean all students are really

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970
with such I mean all students are really
 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.370
with such I mean all students are really
exciting but it's really lucky to be

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380
exciting but it's really lucky to be
 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.810
exciting but it's really lucky to be
with such motivated students it's you

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820
with such motivated students it's you
 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.580
with such motivated students it's you
know it's an easy job so it's it's

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
know it's an easy job so it's it's
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.760
know it's an easy job so it's it's
really up to you you know if the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770
really up to you you know if the
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.770
really up to you you know if the
students are engaged it's something you

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780
students are engaged it's something you
 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.090
students are engaged it's something you
have to think about you know how do you

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100
have to think about you know how do you
 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.579
