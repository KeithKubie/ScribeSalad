KACEY MCCALLISTER: Thanks, guys.

00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:10.310
Oh, I'm happy to be here.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.430
And you guys can guess which is
the most challenging out of all

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.470
those accomplishments.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.550
It's the kids.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.900
Five kids is-- well, just
for instance, just a snapshot

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.100
of my life is this morning.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.320
I wake up to a child crawling
in bed, second later,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.620
my wife, who has been sick for
three days, lost her voice--

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.210
and now, I'm up here, right?

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.160
And she says Kacey, he
smells like throw up.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.940
And so then, you've got to
go take care of the throw up

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.700
in the kid's bed.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.060
And that was just this morning.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.610
But that's every day--

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.810
something different
every day in my life.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.560
I'm super excited to be here.

00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:53.990
Disability is such
an interesting work

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:56.330
because it encompasses
so many things.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.720
And for so much of
my life, I did not

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.660
want to be considered
in that category

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.870
because "disabled" meant
you couldn't do stuff.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.640
And that was not me.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.150
I was never that way.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.510
And I probably should stop
going in that direction

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.820
because I need to
start at the beginning.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.510
It's awesome going into
schools because kids--

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.320
and I was just in
one yesterday-- kids

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.700
will come right up to me, and
they'll just kind of look.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.250
What happened?

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.075
Really loud.

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:33.690
And I love that about kids.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.970
They're so interested.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.720
And sometimes, as adults,
we live in this PC world.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.570
You know, you can't ask
or can't do anything

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.620
that might be offensive.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.490
But kids, they don't have that,
and they're insatiably curious.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.110
And so I love it.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.550
So I look at them and I go,
well, I don't have any legs.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.440
They're like, why?

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.370
And very seriously, I'll look
at them and say, a squirrel.

[MOCK SCREAM]

[MAKES SOUND OF CAR RACING OFF]

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.010
But that's not what happened.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.930
When I was six years old, I
grew up in a little small town

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.570
called Kemmerer, Wyoming.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.660
Has anybody ever heard
of-- yeah, exactly.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.070
It's a really small town.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.260
Well, when I was
six, we went down

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.390
to Utah, another small town.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.880
My uncle was going
on a mission trip,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.750
and so we went down
to see him off.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.170
Well, after the church
services were over,

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.690
we were standing on
the edge of the road.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.460
Now, it was December, December
20th in Utah, so pretty cold,

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.010
snow everywhere,
and we were standing

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.830
on the edge of a
divided highway.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.740
So there's just
one lane each way.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.500
Well, as I'm standing there
next to my mom and my dad right

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.860
by my side, they said,
OK, Kacey, there's

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.630
two cars coming in a truck.

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.880
Well, as any good
six-year-old does,

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.600
I looked one way at the
two cars that went by me,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.340
but I forgot to
look the other way

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.735
and, instead, started
sprinting across the road.

00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:09.410
I don't remember what happened.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.890
I don't know if I didn't
hear about the truck

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.490
or I just went anyway, but I
sprinted across a road right

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.450
in front of the truck.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.370
Now, it wasn't just
a pickup truck.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.259
It was a semi truck that
was barreling down on me.

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:24.550
And I ran right in front of it.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.860
At the last second, I even
drove to get out of the way.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.970
But the truck was
able to clip my legs

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.570
and rolling me beneath
the wheels right there,

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:35.920
as my parents watched.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.060
Some of you are parents.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.460
You can imagine that
horrible feeling.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.580
But truck stops,
my dad rushes over,

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.020
and I'm laying
there on the road.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.460
And when he gets
to me, my left leg

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.070
had been completely
severed by the semi truck,

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.280
and they later found it
between two of the wheels.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.670
I got a little bit
of stub left, which

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.920
is good for wrestling and doing
movies called "Fear the Stub--"

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.400
that I'll be great.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.182
Hey, if there's five Sharknados,
I think "Fear the Stub--"

[MAKES KUNG FU SOUNDS]
Fear the Stub!

00:04:13.652 --> 00:04:14.860
You guys are like, is it out?

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.459
When can I see this?

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:18.480
No, it's not.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.690
I've got to get funding.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.040
But my right leg was still--

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.670
well, it was kind of attached.

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.540
It was beaten up pretty good,
but it was still kind of there.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.472
Well, my dad holds
me and talks to me.

00:04:29.472 --> 00:04:31.180
You know, what do you
want for Christmas?

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.950
And just kept me going
until the ambulance was

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.930
able to get there and
rush me to the hospital--

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.625
the local hospital.

00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:38.802
It was pretty small.

00:04:38.802 --> 00:04:40.760
I don't know what happened
when they wheeled me

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.290
into the operating room.

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.850
I assume the doctors just
looked at me and was like,

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.480
I don't think the
big Band-Aid's going

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.646
to cover this one I don't know.

00:04:50.646 --> 00:04:52.270
But they weren't able
to help me there.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.850
And so they had to fly
me to Salt Lake City.

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.400
And it was Utah
through a blizzard.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.080
So that was nice.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.420
I really don't remember.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.900
I remember as they loaded me
out of the helicopter on top

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.060
of the hospital, I
remember laying there

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.050
on the stretcher filling
the [MAKES SOUND EFFECT]

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:17.770
of the helicopter and my
one thought was, it's cold.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.350
That was it.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.150
That was my first thought.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.350
It wasn't until much later
when I woke up that I found out

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.450
I didn't have legs.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.220
But they rushed me
into the hospital,

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.630
and my right side was so
damaged they told my parents,

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.590
OK, we might be able
to save his leg,

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.580
but it's going to require
dozens of surgeries,

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.030
and he may never be able to
use it throughout his life.

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.520
And my mom said, well,
that's an easy decision.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.200
He can live without legs.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.820
Amputate his leg.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.100
And so they amputated
my right side.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.040
Besides the whole
not-having-legs thing,

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.170
I really didn't have
that many injuries.

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.950
I broke my right elbow,
I split my tongue--

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.900
I knocked out a bunch of teeth.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.050
I have a nice little bald
spot right there on the back.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:09.020
I know some of you are
sporting your own more up here.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.870
So I had a few injuries.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:16.830
So as a six-year-old, one
of them was so confusing.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.970
I had this big cut
right down the center.

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:22.160
And I'm like, Mom,
what's that from?

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.500
And they said, well,
they had to cut

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.835
you open to see if
you were bleeding.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.440
In my mind, I just
imagined the doctor,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.270
like, he started to cut.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.250
And the nurse goes,
doctor, he's bleeding.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:39.950
And the doctor's like, I
know, and keeps cutting.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.360
And the nurse is like,
he's still bleeding!

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.460
Like, I know!

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.820
And he keeps cutting.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.890
And I didn't know.

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.600
But now, I understand
they had to make

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.580
sure the inside stuff was good.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.620
And luckily, it was.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.650
Ooh, I also have one right here.

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.760
And I always tell the
middle-schoolers this one.

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.760
This is from a colostomy.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.275
You guys know what that is?

00:07:00.275 --> 00:07:06.860
It's when they take your
rectum, and they move it.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:08.900
That was probably one
of the worst things,

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.800
to have to sit there with your
rectum on your stomach and poop

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.910
into a bag.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.350
But there was there
was a silver lining.

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:18.530
You've got to look
for the good, right?

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.210
I have brothers.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.170
So not only did I poop in the
bag, I also farted in the bag.

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.300
And as anybody with
brothers knows,

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.180
that's a powerful weapon
to be able to store

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.600
your farts for your brother.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.510
Well, it wasn't very
long until I was

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.970
ready to leave the hospital.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.790
And as I was leaving
the hospital,

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:43.700
the doctors told my
parents something

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.220
that would change
the rest of my life--

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.430
that would be very important.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:52.920
They told my parents
not to do stuff for me.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.522
OK, now, you have
this six-year-old.

00:07:55.522 --> 00:07:56.980
You have this little
six-year-old--

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:58.630
he was a little
six-year-old; now, he's

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.220
a really little six-year-old.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.656
Why would the
doctors, the people

00:08:02.656 --> 00:08:04.030
that should be
taking care of me,

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.230
tell my parents not
to do stuff for me?

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:09.780
Why would they say that?

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.592
This is the audience
participation part of it.

00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:13.800
Yeah, why would they do that?

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.758
To force you to learn to
do stuff for yourself?

00:08:15.758 --> 00:08:16.530
Exactly!

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:18.600
I had to learn how
to do stuff myself.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.590
I see a lot of--

00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:22.410
sorry for the air quotes--

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:26.820
"disabled people," and they
live their lives disabledly?

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:28.620
Disabilitedly?

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.380
They lived like they're
disabled because they

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.020
let other people do things
that they very well could

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:34.900
do on their own.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.809
When I got home--

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:39.030
this is a cool
Uncle Kurt story--

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.909
when I got home,
I was in my room

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:43.919
sitting-- you can imagine
this is the floor.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.700
If I sat down there,
you couldn't see me.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.700
So I was in my room, and I
want to show my Uncle Kurt

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:50.200
something.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.760
So I'm like, Hey Uncle
Kurt, turn on the light.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.910
Well, my dad, taking this lesson
from the doctors to heart,

00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:01.470
slaps his hand away and
said, don't you dare.

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.730
Like that.

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:05.200
And my Uncle Kurt turns
around like, Bernie,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.510
stopped being a jerk!

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.070
I'm just going to
turn on the light.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.500
He's like Kurt, don't
you turn on the light.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.640
He has to do it.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:15.240
And my mom Uncle Kurt got mad
at my dad and said, Bernie!

00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.380
You're being stupid.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.480
Let me turn on the light.

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.880
And my dad's like, no.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.490
And so I looked around the room,
and I had to figure it out.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:25.990
I looked around the room
and, I found a baseball bat.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.860
And I'm like, dad.

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:32.580
And I went over to the
light, and I used the bat

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.500
to turn on the light.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.800
And that was just one
little example of the things

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:40.440
I had to figure out
throughout my life.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:45.630
Very soon after getting home,
I wanted to start doing sports.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:49.080
Well, the next sport up was
Little League, was tee ball.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.850
And I was in my little
hospital wheelchair thing.

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:55.500
And my dad--

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.510
I was pretty weak
still, so my dad

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.910
would push me around the bases.

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:02.970
Now, I don't know
your dad's, but my dad

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:06.507
is extremely
competitive, especially

00:10:06.507 --> 00:10:07.590
when it comes to baseball.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.370
So little six-year-old me
would hit the ball, pew!

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:13.820
And then, my dad would push me.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.320
[MAKES SOUND EFFECT] And
I'm sitting there going,

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:19.100
[SCREAM] slow down!

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.087
No, we're going to win!

00:10:21.087 --> 00:10:24.430
[GIGGLE] I'm going to die!

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:28.260
Well, the next year,
though, the next year,

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.950
I decided that I didn't want my
dad pushing me around anymore.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.830
So I decided to get
out of my wheelchair

00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.180
and start playing
from the ground.

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.140
Now, I won't be able
to run that far--

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:41.580
right off the edge--

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:44.520
but I found that if
I hit left-handed,

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.370
I was like a foot
closer to first base.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:49.770
So I would hit the ball.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:53.410
And then-- I'll
pantomime my running--

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:54.780
that's a horrible run--

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.250
you'll see it in
the video later.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:00.000
But then, I'd run to first
base on my hands and on my but.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.390
Now, I wasn't very fast,
and I got out a lot,

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:05.400
but I was out there playing.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.500
I was out there doing
stuff that, honestly,

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.710
should have been impossible.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:12.570
How does a guy without
legs play baseball?

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:15.810
Well, I figured it out.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:18.690
I was in elementary, and I had
to do all those PE things--

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.820
I had to figure out
how to do push-ups!

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.970
How do you do push-ups when
you're in a wheelchair?

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.260
Well, my first attempt
went something like this.

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.220
I got out of my
chair, and I started

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.300
doing push-ups like this.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.926
And I thought I was awesome.

00:11:33.926 --> 00:11:36.270
Because I could do,
like, a million of them.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:37.930
But like, can you
do a clap push-up.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:38.440
Oh, yeah.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.720
Well, after a while, though,
I started getting into sports,

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.930
and I wanted to get stronger.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.680
I wanted to be able to
do some harder push.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.050
And so I started doing
push-ups like this.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.620
And so I started
figuring out how

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:06.380
to challenge myself
and push myself.

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:08.350
And then, I got into wrestling.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.020
Hold on.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.740
I've got to tuck this in.

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.340
I don't want to show off my
My Little Pony underwear.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.940
That would be embarrassing.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.250
You guys are like,
uh, that's creepy.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.530
The kid thought it
was funny, all right?

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:22.880
All right, so I started
doing push-ups like this.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.800
I had to figure out how to
challenge myself and push

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.500
myself.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.160
I mean, yeah, it's nice
to say I was doing things.

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.070
But even more than that,
I wanted to be successful.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:41.260
Well, growing up in
a house full of boys,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.480
I had three brothers
and one sisters.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.790
We were playing sports all
the time, and one of them

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:46.630
was basketball.

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:49.180
I mean, this was the
era of Michael Jordan,

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.890
Scottie Pippin, Dennis Rodman--

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:53.180
we were Bulls fans--
or, I was, at least.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.110
And we all wanted to be
the next Michael Jordan.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.917
Well, I decided that I was
going to try out for basketball.

00:12:59.917 --> 00:13:02.500
Well, I went down to the league
and my brother was trying out.

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.760
And we did it.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.242
I would dribble the ball.

00:13:05.242 --> 00:13:06.700
I wasn't good at
shooting the ball,

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.550
but I would dribble, and
steal, and run the whatevers,

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:10.990
and do the things.

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:15.760
And afterwards, the directors
came up to my parents,

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:21.138
and they said we recommend
Kacey doesn't play basketball.

00:13:21.138 --> 00:13:24.250
My parents were like,
OK, he wants to play.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:25.160
Let him play.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.160
They're like, well, we're
afraid he'll get hurt.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.910
My mom's, like, oh,
that's all right.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:34.640
She probably said something
along the lines of, um,

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.960
he's tougher than you are.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.070
Let him play.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:38.750
Basically, they didn't
want to get sued,

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:40.250
and I didn't get
to play that year.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:42.290
Well, the next year,
there was new directors,

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:43.460
and I tried again.

00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:47.490
But once again, I was
told, no, you cannot play.

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:50.167
Now ladies and gentlemen, in our
lives-- throughout your lives,

00:13:50.167 --> 00:13:51.750
you've had times
like this, and you're

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.590
going to have more times like
this, where someone is going

00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:56.690
to tell you what you can't do.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:59.460
Maybe, honestly, now
that we're adults,

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.760
it's going to be you that tells
yourself what you can't do.

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.430
And instead of
listening to that-- now,

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.620
very easily I could
have put myself

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:12.880
in the box they called "cripples
can't play basketball."

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.620
I could have put
myself in that box

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.330
and not been able
to play basketball.

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.300
But instead of that, I went to
another league, Boys and Girls

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.710
Club, rolled up to the
desk and said, hey,

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.500
can I play basketball?

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:28.090
To which they responded,
yeah, we let everybody play.

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:30.370
Like, what?

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:31.710
And so I played basketball.

00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.200
I wasn't great.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:33.970
I wasn't great.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:37.150
But I was able to play--
made like three baskets

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.040
the whole year, but I played.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.910
Well, later on, I get
into eighth grade,

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:42.700
and I have this
experience again.

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.880
I wanted to do cross country.

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:47.350
Any runners out here?

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:48.220
Couple of you?

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.580
So cross country is not--
it's not on a track.

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:52.990
It's not running trail--

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:55.570
well, it is running
trails, but these are--

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:58.390
especially here in the
Northwest-- you got mud, dirt,

00:14:58.390 --> 00:14:59.470
grass--

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:02.110
running through the
trees, it's pretty crazy.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.730
And this was the
first time in my life

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:06.110
my parents kind of
questioned my life choices.

00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:10.100
They're like,
Kacey, there's mud.

00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:12.440
I'm like, I know!

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.430
Kacey, you're in a wheelchair.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:16.174
Yes!

00:15:16.174 --> 00:15:18.340
They're like, Kacey, that's
going to be really hard.

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:19.540
I know.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:20.290
It's a challenge.

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:23.140
And then my dad, of course,
looks at me and goes,

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:26.510
well, if you start it,
you've got to finish it.

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.370
I'm like, yeah, I know.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:29.870
And so I went in.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:30.950
I turned the form in.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.327
And then, I got called
down to the office.

00:15:33.327 --> 00:15:35.660
And I don't know if you've
ever had this situation where

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:40.040
you sit down, and there's
like five adults just staring

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:40.790
at you.

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:42.620
You guys are like,
I hate that now.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:46.730
But as a little eighth grader,
my voice was still changing,

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.920
and they're just staring at me.

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.150
I was a little freaked out.

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.870
They're like, Kacey, why do
you want to do cross country?

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.020
I thought it would be fun.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.240
Well, Kacey, it's
going to be hard.

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:06.830
Yeah, my mom said
there would be mud.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:11.290
And I said, I could do it.

00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:12.260
I wasn't very eloquent.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.884
And they were like,
Kacey, we recommend

00:16:13.884 --> 00:16:16.930
you don't do cross country.

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:20.470
Oh, OK.

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:23.500
Can I do football?

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.160
Now, I don't know what they were
thinking, but they said yes!

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.100
I don't know where cross
country is dangerous

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:31.330
and football is safe.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:33.940
You know, cross
country, there's--

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:35.560
trees.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.900
Football, it's safe.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.220
We'll give him a helmet!

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.170
So they put me in
the safest place--

00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:46.707
in football, defensive line,
right there on the front.

00:16:46.707 --> 00:16:48.790
It was great, though because
I was nice and short.

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.440
So the guys with
the ball, they'd

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.090
come running right at me.

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:53.420
They couldn't see me at all.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:54.832
I'd grab them-- boom!

00:16:54.832 --> 00:16:55.332
Yeah!

00:16:55.332 --> 00:16:57.270
Except I was an eighth-grade
boy, and so I was like,

00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.770
[HIGH-PITCHED VOICE]
yeah, what now?

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.340
What now?

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.890
Well, the next year, though,
I got into high school,

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:04.329
and I decided, you know what?

00:17:04.329 --> 00:17:07.720
I am going to show them
that I can do cross country.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.400
So I went to the office--

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.010
said, hey, can I
do cross country?

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:15.550
To which they replied, as
long as you sign the waiver.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:18.190
If you die, we don't care.

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:21.280
And they let me
do cross country.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.810
Now, I wasn't fast.

00:17:22.810 --> 00:17:25.480
I was last almost
every single race,

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.870
but I finished
every single race.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:30.640
One race was called "trask."

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:31.870
They run you through the mud.

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:33.340
They run you through rivers.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:36.220
They run you through
these deep mud pits

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.260
where I would sync
up to my neck.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.930
But I finished
every single race.

00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:44.140
Well, year after year, I got
faster, and I got better.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.990
Until my senior
year, I was actually

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:52.740
so fast that I was actually
beating the top runners

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:53.940
at the races I went to.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:58.960
In fact, I eventually won the
district meet of my league.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:02.200
Now you think with
that big of a switch,

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.906
OK, here's a guy that
can do anything--

00:18:04.906 --> 00:18:05.780
you know what I mean?

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.210
He's last, very last.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:07.794
He's doing it.

00:18:07.794 --> 00:18:08.334
That's great.

00:18:08.334 --> 00:18:09.270
That's inspirational.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.470
And now, he's fast.

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:16.090
Well, there is a lot of people
that looked at that as unfair.

00:18:16.090 --> 00:18:17.690
It wasn't unfair
when I was slow.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:19.010
But now, it was.

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:24.370
And so they actually didn't
let me run the state meet.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.260
The reasoning is great--
because it wasn't

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.560
designed for wheelchairs.

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.810
No cross-country
courses, it's all

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:34.750
through the mud, and through
the trails, and grass,

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:36.780
and up and down
hills, so no course

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.170
is great for wheelchairs.

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:39.520
But I was able to do that.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.110
Well, I did other sports.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:43.330
I wrestled.

00:18:43.330 --> 00:18:48.540
I eventually took second
place in state for wrestling.

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:51.340
I did track as well
doing distance racing,

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.680
and that actually is
what led me to college,

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.130
where I started doing
wheelchair racing in college.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:19:01.930
I started track, and
I got into marathons.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:05.410
Now, marathons, they seem crazy,
and they are kind of crazy.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:07.750
And the people that
do them are crazy.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.810
And I started doing them in
college, but what was crazy

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:11.770
is I loved them.

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:14.680
So I guess that
describes me right there.

00:19:14.680 --> 00:19:16.030
And I started doing marathons.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:19.360
In fact, I beat my coach
at a few marathons.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.580
Well, after a year
in college, I went

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:24.820
on a mission for my church,
and then afterwards came back

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:27.910
and started racing
marathons again.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:30.460
Well, after a while,
though, I realized-- now,

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:32.500
this sounds crazy,
but after a while,

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.800
I realized that marathons had
no more challenge because it was

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.250
just 26 miles--

00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.170
and I wanted to
challenge myself.

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.100
I wanted to see what I could do.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.600
So often in media and when
you see people in wheelchairs,

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.610
it's always looked at
as, what they can't do.

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:52.580
Well, I wanted to show--

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.990
and I had started this
motivational speaking company,

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.150
and I wanted to show
people what was possible.

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:03.340
I wanted to show
people what I could do

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:05.470
and, hopefully,
what they could do.

00:20:05.470 --> 00:20:09.900
Take away those excuses that we
all put on ourselves every day.

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:12.010
Every day we put an excuse--

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:16.510
why we can't work out
that day, why we can't--

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:17.200
take your pick.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.990
You have your own
challenges in life.

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:24.730
And so I wanted to do something
to strip away those excuses.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:27.190
Well, I started looking
for a challenge--

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:28.640
started looking for a challenge.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:33.700
And then, one day, I see this
race called "Spartan Race."

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.320
Who has heard of the
Spartan Race before?

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:37.550
All right, a few of you.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:38.800
So let me describe it.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:40.990
You take a cross-country course.

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:44.470
We're talking through the
woods, mud, everything.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:48.310
You take one of those courses,
and then you add obstacles--

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:53.080
like rope climb, fire
jump, bucket carry,

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.200
sandbag carry-- you had
all these obstacles,

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.830
these crazy obstacles, and
that's called a "Spartan Race."

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:03.760
Well, guys, I
looked at this race,

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:08.450
and my first thought was,
OK, that's impossible.

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:09.100
That's insane.

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.370
That's so stupid.

00:21:10.370 --> 00:21:13.240
There's no way that
a guy without legs

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.980
can do one of those things.

00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:18.250
That's insane!

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:22.140
But it wasn't too long until
I realized, oh, OK, this

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:24.150
is exactly what I want to do.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:26.700
I don't know if I can
finish it, but I'm

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:27.850
going to give it a shot.

00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:29.940
And so I signed up
for the first one,

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:31.870
and it just about killed me.

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.119
It was awful.

00:21:33.119 --> 00:21:35.160
I get done with the race,
and we're driving home.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.430
My wife looks over and
says, well, that was fun.

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:40.130
I guess you can
cross that one off.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.670
I was like, yeah, that was hard.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.590
I want to do the next one.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.360
She's like, no!

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.590
That one almost killed you!

00:21:46.590 --> 00:21:48.380
A longer one will kill you!

00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:51.400
I'm like, maybe!

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.710
But I want to do it anyway.

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:56.640
And so I did the next one, which
was twice as long, eight miles.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:01.550
And then, I decided to do the
next one, which was 13 miles.

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:03.260
And then, I did
all three of them

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:05.090
in a year called the trifecta.

00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:09.350
And every time, I'm
looking for a challenge.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.960
I'm looking for
something to push me.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.540
Because, guys, in our lives,
regardless of our situation,

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.170
regardless of our challenge--

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:21.170
and honestly, we all
have something that we

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:23.210
can claim disability on.

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:27.830
We all have a challenge
in life that slows us down

00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:30.200
from accomplishing what
we want to accomplish.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:34.030
Now, honestly, this
is not my disability.

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:37.590
I'm not disabled because
I'm in a wheelchair.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.545
I have found a way to do
just about everything--

00:22:40.545 --> 00:22:43.140
or, I found a way to do
everything that I want to do.

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.750
I have other
challenges for sure.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:51.130
So as we look at this
thing called "disability--"

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:54.520
and I still don't
like that word.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.080
I like "adaptive."

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:59.650
There's a big push right
now called "para athletes,"

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.420
adaptive athletic.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.430
Has anybody seen
the Paralympics--

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:04.780
watch the Paralympics?

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:06.010
You watch those guys.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:09.620
They are doing the exact same
sports, training just as hard

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.650
if not harder than
the Olympians,

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.500
because every single
one of the paralympians

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.260
has had some major
tragedy in their lives.

00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:19.360
Now, each and every
one of us has either

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:24.870
had some major tragedy or
has known someone with that.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.160
That's how we get stronger.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:29.000
Let me tell you
about steel working--

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.410
like the old blacksmith
steel working.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:34.740
The blacksmith would
take a hunk of iron--

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.660
usually, it's still rod,
and he'd put it in the fire.

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:41.410
Now the fire isn't what
makes the iron strong.

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:44.070
In fact, the fire makes it soft.

00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:45.522
Heating up metal makes it soft.

00:23:45.522 --> 00:23:46.230
That makes sense.

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:47.600
You have to be able to shape it.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.700
Well, that iron comes
out of the fire,

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.050
and it's ready to be shaped.

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:53.470
Now, it needs to be hardened.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:55.470
Now, if you just let
it cool, it would still

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:59.110
be a very soft metal, and
it would break very easily.

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:01.320
But what does a blacksmith
do after he pulls it out

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.894
of the fire?

00:24:02.894 --> 00:24:03.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:04.430
KACEY MCCALLISTER: Not quite.

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:06.100
What does he do
before quenching it?

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:06.440
AUDIENCE: Works it.

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.606
KACEY MCCALLISTER: Works it!

00:24:07.606 --> 00:24:08.730
But how does he work it?

00:24:08.730 --> 00:24:09.730
AUDIENCE: With a hammer.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:10.570
KACEY MCCALLISTER:
With a hammer!

00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.520
He's pounding on that
thing, all right?

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.570
He is slamming it.

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.120
And I actually listen
to a book recently,

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.890
and it talked about
the hammering.

00:24:17.890 --> 00:24:20.860
It actually changes the
structure of the metal.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:24.790
Hammering it changes
the crystal structure

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:27.460
to make a stronger
and a tougher metal.

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:31.240
And I realized after hearing
that, that is exactly

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.410
like us in our lives.

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:34.750
Guys, that's kind of why--

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.850
at least, for me,
that's why I'm down here

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:40.570
on this Earth is to get
better and to get stronger,

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:41.890
not necessarily--

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:45.610
not necessarily these amazing
guns right here-- this, too.

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:47.800
But-- I just wanted
to show off here.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.640
Let's just-- I don't
know how to pose.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.270
OK, I mean, I'm not talking
about that kind of strength.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:57.970
I'm talking about
the strength inside.

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:02.680
Because the more challenges
that we're able to get through,

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.770
the more challenges that
we're able to accomplish,

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:07.780
the stronger we'll
be-- and yeah,

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.990
physically, but also up here.

00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:13.630
Once you've gone through
some crazy challenges,

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:17.080
the little things just
don't seem that bad anymore.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.810
After dealing with
five kids when you're

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:22.900
kid climbs into your
bed covered in throw up,

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:27.820
that's just Friday morning
before you leave to Google.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:29.140
That's just what life is.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:31.960
But that is exactly what--

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.610
that's the change we need
to see in disabilities.

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:37.270
They are not a limiting factor.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:40.180
Yeah, there may need
to be adaptations.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.480
There may need to be
some accommodations

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:47.570
that, as we help people to
figure out what they can be,

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:50.620
we need to help them,
not enable them.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.410
And I have a son who's
also in a wheelchair.

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:56.840
And so very often, we have to
balance what we do with him.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:59.210
Are we enabling him?

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:01.850
Are we doing everything for him?

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:04.500
Now what can he do on his own?

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.700
And so as we look
at disabilities

00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:10.310
in this new world
we're living in,

00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:12.250
we need to see them
in a different light.

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:15.050
Disabilities are not "dis."

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:17.290
And I don't like it
started with the "dis"

00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:20.550
because it sounds so negative.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.810
Yeah, there's people
with challenges.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:24.880
And it might be mental
challenges as well.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:31.450
My oldest has ADHD and diagnosed
with autism as well, I think.

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:37.240
My second, he's autistic,
the next has a speech delay.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.060
And the kid in a wheelchair,
we adopted him from Ukraine.

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.600
He spent the first
six years in a bed.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.000
He has CP; he's blind.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.080
So we have some amazing
diversity in our home,

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:52.720
but you wouldn't believe
what incredible kids

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.660
they are because
of their challenge,

00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:58.540
they have the world in a
completely different light.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:02.380
And I can see their strengths
because of their diversity.

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:04.180
I'm diverse physically.

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.250
My kids are diverse mentally.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.460
We all have--

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.360
I see a lot of racial
diversity here.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.150
Each and every one of
us brings something else

00:27:13.150 --> 00:27:15.781
amazing to the table.

00:27:15.781 --> 00:27:18.870
OK, now, after going
to that rant for a bit,

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:21.480
I want to show you
guys a Spartan Race.

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:25.312
Because this, honestly,
encompasses everything

00:27:25.312 --> 00:27:26.520
that I've been talking about.

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:31.260
This talks about what really is
possible, but it also shows--

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.320
there's a few instances where
you'll see people helping me,

00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.280
because I'm short.

00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:41.940
And an eight-foot
wall is just so high.

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:43.170
And so I need help.

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:46.330
But you'll see challenges.

00:27:46.330 --> 00:27:49.560
And the hardest one here
is the bucket brigade.

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:50.460
Now, think about it.

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.770
Before I even show this
to you, picture this.

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:56.430
80-pound bucket of just
a five-gallon bucket

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:58.680
filled with rocks.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.070
Now, most of you probably
think that's a good challenge.

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:04.530
Maybe some of you think
that's a good workout.

00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:07.750
But regardless, it's hard.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:08.890
Take your legs off.

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:11.024
How do you move that bucket?

00:28:11.024 --> 00:28:12.530
It's a challenge.

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:14.480
So let me go ahead
and start this.

Pretty cool, huh?

Who's ready to go do
a Spartan Race now?

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.700

But that's our lives, guys.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.510
We're going to have challenges.

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:41.720
Life is going to knock you
down face down into the mud.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.970
And honestly, we're
going to have a choice.

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:45.270
You make the choice.

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:50.750
You either start playing in the
mud or you lay down and suffer.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:54.080
And I've chosen to
play in the mud.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.670
I'm a little kid at heart.

00:32:55.670 --> 00:33:01.370
Well, I want to open it up to
questions for a little bit.

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:03.910
And then, I will-- ooh,
hey, a mic for the crowd.

00:33:03.910 --> 00:33:06.050
That'd be great.

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:09.560
Please feel free
to ask questions.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.170
Sometimes I'm disappointed
in adults, because you just

00:33:12.170 --> 00:33:14.030
sit there and stare at me.

00:33:14.030 --> 00:33:18.610
Kids are like, how do
you go to the bathroom!

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:19.900
I aim for the middle.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.210
How do you go to the bathroom?

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:28.130
So go ahead and question away.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:30.230
AUDIENCE: So I just
want to know how long it

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:31.960
took to do the Spartan Race?

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.410
Like, 13 miles is a long way.

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:37.520
I can run 13 miles,
but I have legs.

00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:38.720
How long does that take?

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.220
Because that's going
to be even more

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.140
grueling, just because
it's just so long.

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.610
KACEY MCCALLISTER: Well,
it depends on the terrain.

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:46.850
So if I'm just
out on the road, I

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:50.330
can do about 2 and 1/2 miles
an hour, which is pretty slow,

00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:52.880
but you start adding
obstacles and stuff.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:56.600
It slows me down last
April here in Snohomish.

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.770
It was as a bog.

00:33:57.770 --> 00:33:58.385
It was muddy.

00:33:58.385 --> 00:34:00.290
It took me a mile per hour.

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:02.290
It was eight hours
to finish that.

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:06.590
I just did one here in
Lake Tahoe, 13.5 miles,

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:08.510
but it's elevation.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:12.770
We were climb and 4,000 feet,
and that took me 12 hours

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:15.243
to finish that 13.5 mile course.

00:34:15.243 --> 00:34:16.409
AUDIENCE: That's so amazing.

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:17.120
KACEY MCCALLISTER: Yeah.

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:17.870
AUDIENCE: I'm really inspired.

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:19.245
KACEY MCCALLISTER:
Oh, thank you.

00:34:19.245 --> 00:34:21.929
Well, it's pretty
cool coming up--

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:24.360
yeah, we've got a
Spartan in the back.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:30.449
Coming up, I am doing a 24-hour
Spartan Race in Iceland.

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:34.380
Yeah, it's going to be a
five-mile loop in near freezing

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:35.489
conditions.

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:39.675
So I am nervous, and excited,
and ready for that challenge.

00:34:39.675 --> 00:34:40.800
I made the mistake, though.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:45.719
The guy that started Spartan
Race-- name is Joe De Sena--

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:48.480
he was there in Tahoe,
and he saw me finish.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.239
And after the race,
I looked at him

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:52.679
and I said, well,
Joe, I'm always

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:56.250
looking for a bigger challenge,
something to finally beat me,

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:58.590
and you haven't beat me yet.

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.920
And he's kind of crazy.

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:04.680
And he looks at me and
he's like, all right.

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:06.060
I'll beat you.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:06.960
I'll find something.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.410
So he invited me to this.

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:14.880
So I'll have to prove to him
I can keep going for 24 hours.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:15.750
Did you have a--

00:35:15.750 --> 00:35:18.440
AUDIENCE: How'd you get over the
fire without burning yourself?

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:20.815
KACEY MCCALLISTER: Is that an
awesome part of that video?

00:35:20.815 --> 00:35:21.690
Yeah.

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:23.970
So I had no clue how
I was going to do it.

00:35:23.970 --> 00:35:27.540
That fire jump was the first
fire jump I'd ever done.

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:31.060
Now I don't know if any of
you have been close to a fire.

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:35.490
But as you get closer,
the heat is not

00:35:35.490 --> 00:35:36.980
contained right at the fire.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.220
That's the beauty of a fire.

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:39.630
It radiates the heat.

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:43.080
Well, about from
here to those chairs,

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.750
I could feel this
blistering heat.

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:50.010
And it was so scary to
take those next steps just

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:52.700
to get up to the fire.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:55.150
And without really
knowing what to do,

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:58.830
I found two places that
weren't burning as bad--

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:02.010
some non-burnt pieces of
wood, grabbed onto them--

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:03.100
and there was no choice.

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:06.060
I had to put my butt right
in the middle of the coals,

00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:10.530
and I placed it, and got
out, and did one of these,

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:13.410
and made sure I wasn't burning.

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:16.050
So I've done a few
fire jumps since then.

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:19.572
But yeah, it's always
scary to do the fire jump.

00:36:19.572 --> 00:36:21.030
AUDIENCE: Well,
it's very exciting.

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:22.238
KACEY MCCALLISTER: Thank you.

00:36:22.238 --> 00:36:23.691
Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

00:36:23.691 --> 00:36:24.940
AUDIENCE: I'll ask a question.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:25.380
KACEY MCCALLISTER: Yeah?

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.810
AUDIENCE: So how much
training do you do,

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:28.230
and what does it look
like for these races?

00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:30.021
KACEY MCCALLISTER:
That's a great question.

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:34.100
Well, with five kids, training
is always a challenge.

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:36.210
I mean, honestly,
I love training.

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:38.940
I love getting out and
exercising, which isn't--

00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:42.420
a lot of people, I understand,
it's hard to get out.

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.240
I understand that, for me,
it's even more difficult

00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.070
because I have little children.

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:51.390
And so my training-- my
hardest part of these races

00:36:51.390 --> 00:36:52.770
is the walking.

00:36:52.770 --> 00:36:54.690
Climbing up a cargo net?

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:55.980
Pretty easy.

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.140
Climbing up a rope?

00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:00.610
Not easy, but I can
do it pretty simply.

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:02.840
Hauling rocks, it
takes strength,

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:05.880
but the hardest is
just the mileage.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:08.160
And so when I workout,
I'm out there running.

00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.270
Last night, I wasn't
able to get out there

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:14.220
till 9:45, pitch dark.

00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:18.330
I kind of live out in the
country, so there's nothing.

00:37:18.330 --> 00:37:21.930
It's pitch dark, scooting
down the middle of a road,

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:24.210
30-something degrees.

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:29.380
And about a mile from home,
I heard coyotes yelling.

00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:31.670
So it was even more
exciting last night.

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:34.080
I kept turning around
looking for the little eyes

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:34.990
in the darkness.

00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:38.280
And it was scary.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.780
So a lot of running.

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:41.520
But I also spear.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.870
They do a spear throw.

00:37:42.870 --> 00:37:45.390
I'm horrible at the spear
throw, so I'm always

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:49.480
chucking a spear trying to
not have to do the burpees.

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:53.670
If you miss an obstacle-- some
of the other obstacle courses,

00:37:53.670 --> 00:37:56.280
if you fail, you just
go to the next one.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:59.220
Spartan Race, if you
fail an obstacle,

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.750
you have to do 30 burpees.

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:06.240
Well, mine aren't how they
really do it, by you squat,

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.660
you go plank push-up,
do a push-up,

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.120
and then you jump, and put
your hands over your head,

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.230
and that's one.

00:38:13.230 --> 00:38:14.910
And you've got to do 30 of them.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:20.880
So nobody likes doing
30 burpees, right?

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.050
AUDIENCE: So I'm a swimmer.

00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:22.944
I'm curious.

00:38:22.944 --> 00:38:24.360
I saw you did some
swimming stuff.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:28.110
Can you share more about how
you train there and what you do?

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:30.040
KACEY MCCALLISTER:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:33.210
I don't do a ton of
swimming, but I love, like,

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:36.180
Ironman Triathlon
training, and so

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.250
I have trained a
lot of swimming.

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.810
I'm not super fast,
but I can do--

00:38:40.810 --> 00:38:42.690
what is it-- is that 50 meters?

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:43.380
The pool?

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.060
I can do that in a minute.

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:46.680
So yeah, a decent pace.

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:48.280
It's a decent pace.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.160
But I haven't done
a full Ironman.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:56.430
I did a half Ironman
because I'm half of a man.

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:57.990
That's a stump slapper.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:00.000
OK.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.670
I have too many legless jokes.

00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:05.070
So yeah, I love swimming.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:08.700
I did a mile swim for the
half Ironman, plan on doing

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.460
a full Ironman one day.

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:14.056
So I like swimming.

00:39:14.056 --> 00:39:15.944
It's good.

00:39:15.944 --> 00:39:17.620
AUDIENCE: Tell us
about your gear.

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:18.620
Like, do you wear--

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:21.510
KACEY MCCALLISTER: Yeah, oh,
gear's a constant battle.

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:26.860
Well, nobody creates a boot
for a guy without legs,

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:29.510
and so I have had to--

00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:31.510
I assume some of
your jobs, you have

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:33.615
to be very innovative
in what you do.

00:39:33.615 --> 00:39:34.240
Well, I assume.

00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:34.670
I don't know.

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:35.503
You guys are Google.

00:39:35.503 --> 00:39:36.600
Google does everything.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.710
So I assume you have
to create new things.

00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:42.740
And that's what I have
to do all the time.

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:45.310
The boot I wear is
off of the design

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:48.160
that my mom did way back
when I was in high school,

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.660
and I've been refining it.

00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:53.740
It's a simple, just,
sleeve with a bottom on it,

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.660
but I've had to actually--

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.700
right near here,
there's Seattle fabrics,

00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:59.200
and they have everything.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:39:59.950
So I went there.

00:39:59.950 --> 00:40:02.260
They had waterproof vinyl.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:05.290
And I used to sew it together,
but now I glue it together

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:07.330
to make it even more durable.

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:11.320
But every single time, every
single training run I go on,

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.170
I come up with a better
idea of how to work my boot

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:17.650
and how to make a better one.

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:21.070
And there's been a good
dozen different styles

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:22.010
and things I've done.

00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:23.530
And that's just my boot.

00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:26.840
Not only that, gloves
are a huge issue.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:30.220
I usually wear mechanic gloves
because they have a good thing

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.330
on the thing, but--

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:33.480
thing on the thing.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:34.120
Wow.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.920
I'm a public speaker.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.190
I do this for a job.

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:39.610
Thing on the thing.

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:41.440
Guard on the knuckles.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:45.200
But it's a constant struggle
to find more padding.

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.070
Going to Iceland, it's
going to be wet and cold.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:51.690
And if my hands get cold, it's
going to really slow me down.

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:53.500
So, yeah, gear.

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.640
Gear is a constant battle.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:41:00.250
Even a backpack is a huge
issue because I'm doing this.

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:02.080
It scrapes right
there on my neck,

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.380
and so I've had to figure
out friction reduction.

00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.030
My arms are doing
this, so I have

00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:12.110
to figure out how to protect
my skin on different places.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.590
Yeah, gear is a constant battle.

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:16.510
AUDIENCE: I was curious
about having children

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:20.230
with autism and ADHD.

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:24.430
What do you find is
effective for, I guess,

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:28.150
communicating and being
patient and positive?

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:32.620
And do you have an
approach that you

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:36.370
take to inspire them
and motivate them

00:41:36.370 --> 00:41:38.237
to create a happy environment?

00:41:38.237 --> 00:41:40.570
KACEY MCCALLISTER: Man, you're
asking the easy questions

00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:41.350
today, right?

00:41:41.350 --> 00:41:42.070
Oh, man.

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:45.210
Well, I am the perfect
parent, just ask--

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:47.380
no, I am not.

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.560
Is there a such thing?

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:53.020
Man, that's a hard
question right there.

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:54.286
Honestly, it's learning.

00:41:54.286 --> 00:41:54.910
It is learning.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:55.990
But you're right.

00:41:55.990 --> 00:42:01.210
Being patient--
because kids are--

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:03.860
I mean, I remember
growing up, I'm like,

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:07.980
well, if you calmly explain to
a child, they'll understand.

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:09.910
I heard some laughs at that.

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:13.600
No, a child-- you
know, kids are kids.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:14.710
Patience.

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:18.310
And parenting is the
great patience learner.

00:42:18.310 --> 00:42:20.020
Kids are crazy.

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:24.660
They just are-- as one
is sitting-- hi, kid.

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.350
Hello.

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:29.290
But they're also awesome.

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:29.980
They'll learn.

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:31.000
They will learn.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.130
And sometimes it's
going to take years.

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:35.650
My daughter-- extreme ADHD.

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:39.070
I mean, not like,
oh, little active--

00:42:39.070 --> 00:42:41.740
like literally
bouncing-off-the-walls,

00:42:41.740 --> 00:42:44.290
can't-sit-in-a-seat ADHD.

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:48.010
But we've, just, little
here and there, patience,

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:50.260
keep reinforcing--
never enabling,

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:51.880
never giving them excuses--

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.040
like, oh, you have ADHD.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.050
You don't have to do this.

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:59.620
No, well, we're going to find
a way for you to take note.

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:01.840
We're going to find a
way for you to do this.

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.540
Autism, same thing.

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:06.350
My son he gets
overwhelmed by things.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:09.040
OK, Patrick, how are we
going to deal with this?

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.910
OK, when you start
feeling like this,

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:12.640
let's this, and this, and this.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:15.700
And of course, they
listen right away to that.

00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:17.070
But patience.

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:21.017
It's all about patience and
just step by step, step by step.

00:43:21.017 --> 00:43:21.850
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:21.850 --> 00:43:24.130
KACEY MCCALLISTER: Thank you.

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:25.570
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:26.140
KACEY MCCALLISTER: Thank you.

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.510
AUDIENCE: I was curious,
what's your diet like?

00:43:28.510 --> 00:43:30.650
What are you drinking
and eating so you're not

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:32.410
experiencing muscle failure?

00:43:32.410 --> 00:43:35.200
KACEY MCCALLISTER: You guys
are asking the worst questions.

00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:36.470
I have five kids.

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:40.120
I eat whatever I can
throw in their faces.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:43.230
Years ago, when I was really
training for wheelchair racing

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:45.460
and doing a lot of
marathons, I kept

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:48.770
reading these books
about these guys,

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:51.069
and they were only
eating plants.

00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:52.110
They weren't eating meat.

00:43:52.110 --> 00:43:54.040
And I'm like, oh,
that's horrible!

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.780
You've got to eat meat to be--

00:43:55.780 --> 00:43:56.955
you've got to be strong!

00:43:56.955 --> 00:43:58.150
You've got to eat meat!

00:43:58.150 --> 00:44:01.090
And then, I realized,
I'm like, fine.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:02.050
I'll try it.

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:04.720
And then, I went and
set the course record

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.400
on this race I did
right after that.

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.410
And I'm like, curse
you, people that

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:10.460
know what you're talking about.

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.730
So plant-based diet.

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:18.120
I love sweet potatoes,
and corn, and I

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.940
make some thing
called Ezekiel bread.

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.935
It just has a lot
of grains in it.

00:44:22.935 --> 00:44:27.540
I'm not like, totally,
die-hard, no animal stuff--

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:30.540
I eat eggs, and some
milk, and stuff.

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:33.390
But mostly whole foods.

00:44:33.390 --> 00:44:34.260
Whole foods.

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:37.390
Danielle took me to
the free restaurant.

00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:40.042
It was a wonderful.

00:44:40.042 --> 00:44:43.230
And like everywhere I looked,
it was just whole food--

00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:47.400
especially the salad bar,
but the more processed

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:50.400
stuff you eat, the more junk
you're putting in your body.

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:54.480
You wouldn't put sand
in your gasoline tank;

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:57.310
why are you putting
McDonald's into your body?

00:44:57.310 --> 00:44:59.090
It's not going to help you.

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:03.990
So given I'm not perfect on
that, I travel all the time--

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:06.720
I mean, it was a four-hour drive
up here, four-hour drive back,

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.220
you know?

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:09.950
It's always a
constant challenge--

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:12.720
constant challenge to eat right.

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.710
But the more I focus
on whole foods,

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:19.670
the more you can eat things
that are not heavily processed,

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:21.300
the better off
you're going to be.

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:23.845
And that helps you
in every aspect.

00:45:23.845 --> 00:45:27.230
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so it looks like
you've got a big focus on doing

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:28.604
able-bodied sports.

00:45:28.604 --> 00:45:30.020
And I was wondering
if you've done

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:33.410
much with the disabled
sports, Paralympic sports

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:35.167
like basketball,
hockey, or wheelchair--

00:45:35.167 --> 00:45:36.500
KACEY MCCALLISTER: Yeah, I have.

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.290
So I did wheelchair racing
in high school, college.

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:42.410
When I hit U of A in college,
they had wheelchair basketball.

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:44.769
Now I wrestled in high school.

00:45:44.769 --> 00:45:46.310
If you know anything
about wrestlers,

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:48.980
we can't shoot the basketball.

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:50.550
We're like here,
and it's over there.

00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:51.530
It doesn't work.

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:54.020
But they're, like, oh,
just come out for the team.

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.000
And I get out there
and I realized

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.144
how much-- especially
wheelchair basketball,

00:45:58.144 --> 00:45:59.810
you really don't have
to touch the ball.

00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:00.700
You just go--

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:03.280
[MAKES RACING SOUND EFFECT]----
zooming down the court.

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.780
I absolutely love
wheelchair basketball.

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:06.380
It's a blast.

00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:10.770
But I've got to play around
with seated volleyball.

00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:14.090
I found out that I'm freakin'
awesome at seated volleyball.

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:15.320
I'm amazing at that.

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:18.430
I love to do sled hockey.

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:20.640
Yeah, I do it when I can.

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.648
Absolutely.

00:46:21.648 --> 00:46:22.645
Go ahead.

00:46:22.645 --> 00:46:24.270
AUDIENCE: I thought
I heard you mention

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:25.980
church, so I wanted
to ask, are you

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:27.620
a person of a particular faith?

00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:27.790
KACEY MCCALLISTER: I am.

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:29.760
AUDIENCE: And has that
impacted your outlook?

00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.504
Or were you ever angry at God?

00:46:31.859 --> 00:46:33.400
KACEY MCCALLISTER:
I never got angry.

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.220
I am a person of faith.

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.130
I was brought up in a--

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:39.390
it's called the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:41.460
Saints-- brought up from birth.

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:47.080
And so I do have a very strong
spiritual aspect to my life.

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.410
And I talked about my
purpose here on earth.

00:46:49.410 --> 00:46:52.590
I believe we all
have that purpose.

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:57.060
But I found that having that
spiritual outlook-- now,

00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:59.250
whatever that be-- if you
have a religious outlook

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:04.560
or even if it's just a different
spiritual aspect to yourself,

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:08.610
as you look inward in
whatever way you do,

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:11.670
you're going to be able to
answer those hard questions

00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:12.660
about yourself.

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:16.500
One of the most amazing
teachings that I follow,

00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.280
it talks about being humble.

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.500
And we have these challenges.

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.300
We have weaknesses in life.

00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:23.280
It's so that we can be humble.

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:27.450
And that's whatever spiritual
aspect you look at--

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:34.320
those weaknesses can actually
become your strengths.

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:35.614
For me, it's God.

00:47:35.614 --> 00:47:37.030
For others, it's
different things.

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:39.640
As we rely on those
other strengths,

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:43.150
we can make those
weaknesses become strong.

00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:47.104
And honestly, that's what I
believe we're down here to do.

00:47:47.104 --> 00:47:47.770
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:48.440
KACEY MCCALLISTER: Hi.

00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:49.460
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for coming today.

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:50.120
KACEY MCCALLISTER: Thank you.

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:52.100
AUDIENCE: You were
mentioning some challenges

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.610
while being a public speaker--

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:56.300
traveling, eating-- can
you tell us more about--

00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:58.430
KACEY MCCALLISTER:
Yeah, well, I've

00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:00.920
been doing this business
for three years now.

00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:04.130
I was actually trained as
a teacher through college

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:06.020
because I wanted
to motivate youth.

00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:07.370
I love the youth.

00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:08.810
They have such potential.

00:48:08.810 --> 00:48:11.490
But nowadays, man,
this right here?

00:48:11.490 --> 00:48:12.580
This is horrible.

00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.080
I know, I know, you
guys are Google.

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.830
You guys are like,
that's my living!

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:16.590
I know!

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:17.960
This is a Pixel 2.

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.270
I love Google.

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:23.160
But for teenagers, it's
a really hard challenge.

00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.950
And so I love
motivating the youth,

00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:26.660
and that's why I
became a teacher.

00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:30.650
And so starting this
motivational speaking business,

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:34.220
I've been doing it, but
there are a lot of challenges

00:48:34.220 --> 00:48:36.050
with health as I travel--

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:38.210
eating right-- exercising.

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:39.590
When you travel--

00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:41.150
I drove four hours up.

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:43.200
I'm here four hours.

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:44.870
And then, I'm driving
four hours home.

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:46.610
When do I exercise?

00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:48.650
Well, it'll be after
all the kids are in bed.

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:52.880
And I go out chasing
coyotes again tonight.

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:56.540
So, yeah, there's so many
challenges, just in this job.

00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:58.480
It's traveling all the time--

00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:00.560
figuring out, eating
right, figuring out

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:03.200
how to work while
you're traveling,

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:05.790
figuring out how to
do all that stuff.

00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:07.160
Yeah, thank you.

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:09.680
Well, I was told to wrap it up.

00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.240
So I'm so grateful to be here.

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:15.080
But before I leave,
I do want to--

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:17.634
this isn't just sitting
here randomly for no reason.

00:49:17.634 --> 00:49:19.050
I know some people
who come in are

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:22.520
like, why is there a dirty
ladder in our conference room?

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:24.710
I brought it, and this
is the ladder I used.

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:27.930
A ladder is very much
like things in our lives.

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:29.810
And I'll give the example.

00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:31.850
I just finished
writing my book--

00:49:31.850 --> 00:49:32.930
plug for my book--

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:34.490
it's coming out in April--

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:36.470
plug for my book--

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:41.060
look for it on social media--
plug for social media.

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:45.050
Our lives and our challenges
are very much like a ladder.

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:50.270
As we start on those challenges,
they may seem impossible.

00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:54.260
I mean, how does a guy
without legs climb a ladder?

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:56.480
Well, for me, it was,
how do I write a book?

00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:57.350
And I'm awful.

00:49:57.350 --> 00:49:59.060
I was awful at writing.

00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:01.380
But how do you do it?

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:03.210
It's one step at a time.

00:50:03.210 --> 00:50:05.720
And as we take
that first step, we

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:09.960
realize that that next
step is going to be hard,

00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:12.230
but it's as hard
as the last one.

00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:16.010
And as we continue on
through that challenge,

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:18.290
we take one step at a time.

00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:22.550
And it might be so challenging,
as you watched in the video,

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:24.810
that you can't do
it on your own.

00:50:24.810 --> 00:50:26.670
It might be disability.

00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:27.840
It might be death.

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:29.690
It might be divorce.

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:32.090
It might be, you get fired.

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:35.160
It might be-- so many things
can happen in our lives.

00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:39.500
But as we look to others, look
to our friends and family,

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:40.580
co-workers--

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:45.630
all those people-- for help, we
can get through that next step.

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:49.400
But, guys, as we continue
to do those hard things,

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:53.030
we will be able to
overcome even the toughest

00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:54.390
challenges in our life.

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:57.660
It might take years!

00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:00.720
It took me four years of cross
country till I was any good.

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.120
It took me four years
of wrestling to make it

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.310
to the state championships.

00:51:05.310 --> 00:51:08.400
But as we overcome
those challenges,

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.140
we're going to find
some strengths.

00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:13.540
And honestly, now,
you've gotten to the top.

00:51:13.540 --> 00:51:15.120
Now, you know you
can overcome it.

00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:15.870
But you know what?

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:18.570
You're going to find some
other things that you can

00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:20.655
do that are even more amazing.

00:51:23.868 --> 00:51:26.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:28.422
I hope you remember--

00:51:28.422 --> 00:51:29.880
I know you're not
going to remember

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:30.990
everything I said today.

00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:32.698
You're going to remember
the crazy tricks

00:51:32.698 --> 00:51:33.960
and the funny stories.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:39.780
But I hope you remember
that nothing is impossible.

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:44.020
We all have some sort
of adaptive thing.

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:47.380
We all have a
challenge in our lives.

00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:52.040
But we all can overcome
them one step at a time.

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:54.040
Thank you so much
for having me here.

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.470
Everybody, remember, get out
there, and have a great day,

00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:57.550
and rise up.

00:51:57.550 --> 00:51:58.820
Thank you so much.

00:51:58.820 --> 00:51:59.500
Take care.

00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:02.850
[APPLAUSE]
