Hi everyone - Emily here for DNews.

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.100
Frog tongues are sticky - and extremely fast.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.370
They can capture insects five times faster
than you can blink, and grab mice and birds

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.870
that weigh up to 1.4 times the frog itself.

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:21.369
For a long time, scientists didn’t have
a full understanding of how that was possible,

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.100
but a new study published in the Journal of
the Royal Society Interface uncovered the

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.080
true nature of the frog tongue.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.480
The researchers discovered that frogs are
able to catch their prey because their tongue

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.369
is incredibly soft and is coupled with saliva
that changes its viscosity — or its thickness

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:36.369
— depending on the situation.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:37.369
Here’s how it works.

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:42.039
When a frog goes to capture its prey, it slaps
its tongue at the victim.

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.629
Because of its squishy, soft nature, the tongue
curls around the prey and acts like a shock

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.219
absorber — taking in the energy of the impact
and preventing the food from bouncing away.

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.489
A frog’s tongue is about 10 times softer
than a human’s, which allows it to be 10

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.039
times as stretchy, spreading out over a large
area of its victim.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.079
This larger contact area gives it better adhesion
so it doesn’t drop its food.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.190
Once the tongue makes contact with a fly,
mouse, or bird, then the saliva goes to work.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.260
The saliva is a non-Newtonian fluid, which
is a fancy way of saying that it’s a fluid

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.390
that doesn’t follow normal fluid rules.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.800
Unlike regular liquids - like water - a non-Newtonian
fluid can change its thickness under pressure.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.440
A frog’s saliva, for example, gets thinner
when the tongue smacks its food.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.720
This allows the spit to spread over the prey.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.740
As the tongue retracts, the saliva becomes
thicker and effectively holds onto the victim.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.700
Once the food enters its mouth, the frog sinks
its eyeballs into its head to exert pressure

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.700
on the tongue and force the food down.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.240
This also thins the saliva again, causing
the prey to slide off the tongue and go down

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.660
the frog’s throat.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.280
Scientists have long studied the stickiness
of amphibian and reptile tongues to try and

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.070
learn more about adhesives.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.430
But so far, we have yet to develop a synthetic
material that can match the speed and versatility

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.670
of a frog’s tongue.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.500
Now that we know more about how a frog captures
its prey, this could inspire the design of

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.340
reversible adhesives that could work at high
speeds.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.740
One example could be at a manufacturing plant
where you had to pick up delicate components

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.700
quickly from a conveyor belt.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.130
Another researcher suggested that it could
lead to the possibility of drones fitted with

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.959
artificial frog tongues that could grab objects
in flight.

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.030
So if you’re looking to grab things on the
go fast, just consult a frog.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.370

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.370
What about you?

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.159
Is this the most you ever thought about frog
tongues?
