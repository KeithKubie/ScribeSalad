00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:52.290
don't think that's been worked out quite
 

00:53:52.290 --> 00:53:54.350
don't think that's been worked out quite
as smoothly as we would hope in all

00:53:54.350 --> 00:53:54.360
as smoothly as we would hope in all
 

00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:59.240
as smoothly as we would hope in all
cases I think that in certain subject

00:53:59.240 --> 00:53:59.250
cases I think that in certain subject
 

00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:02.810
cases I think that in certain subject
areas within the university not

00:54:02.810 --> 00:54:02.820
areas within the university not
 

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:05.780

everything can be acquired in these sort

00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:05.790
everything can be acquired in these sort
 

00:54:05.790 --> 00:54:07.820
everything can be acquired in these sort
of streamlined ways and so even the

00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:07.830
of streamlined ways and so even the
 

00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:09.710
of streamlined ways and so even the
print monograph it's it's harder to

00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:09.720
print monograph it's it's harder to
 

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:13.070
print monograph it's it's harder to
track things down when print runs are

00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:13.080
track things down when print runs are
 

00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:16.370
track things down when print runs are
shorter if you're not right there in

00:54:16.370 --> 00:54:16.380
shorter if you're not right there in
 

00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:19.310
shorter if you're not right there in
terms of submitting your order things

00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:19.320
terms of submitting your order things
 

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:21.560
terms of submitting your order things
may not be quite as readily available

00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:21.570
may not be quite as readily available
 

00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:24.470
may not be quite as readily available
and enter your collection the way it

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480

might have once done so we have to be as

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:27.090
might have once done so we have to be as
 

00:54:27.090 --> 00:54:30.290
might have once done so we have to be as
librarians we have to be very active

00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:30.300
librarians we have to be very active
 

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:33.950
librarians we have to be very active
about seeing how we're going to find

00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960
about seeing how we're going to find
 

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:35.900
about seeing how we're going to find
these publications and bring them into

00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:35.910
these publications and bring them into
 

00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:38.390
these publications and bring them into
our libraries we heard a little bit

00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400
our libraries we heard a little bit
 

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:42.320
our libraries we heard a little bit
about the ACLS humanities ebooks

00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:42.330
about the ACLS humanities ebooks
 

00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:44.440
about the ACLS humanities ebooks
database and there are a number of other

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:44.450
database and there are a number of other
 

00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:47.900
database and there are a number of other
databases and again I think at least

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:47.910
databases and again I think at least
 

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:52.130
databases and again I think at least
within the humanities we are not in an

00:54:52.130 --> 00:54:52.140
within the humanities we are not in an
 

00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:55.160
within the humanities we are not in an
either/or situation in terms of the

00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:55.170
either/or situation in terms of the
 

00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:58.610
either/or situation in terms of the
scholarly monograph in terms of either

00:54:58.610 --> 00:54:58.620

print or electronic pick one or the

00:55:01.940 --> 00:55:01.950
print or electronic pick one or the
 

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:04.940
print or electronic pick one or the
other and that's it there may be some

00:55:04.940 --> 00:55:04.950
other and that's it there may be some
 

00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:07.400
other and that's it there may be some
subject disciplines that we are aware of

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:07.410
subject disciplines that we are aware of
 

00:55:07.410 --> 00:55:11.320
subject disciplines that we are aware of
where the preference for electronic is

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:11.330
where the preference for electronic is
 

00:55:11.330 --> 00:55:15.080
where the preference for electronic is
there and the need to have that print

00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:15.090
there and the need to have that print
 

00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:18.140
there and the need to have that print
copy also on the shelf is of lesser

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:18.150
copy also on the shelf is of lesser
 

00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:20.390
copy also on the shelf is of lesser
importance again I would say that in

00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400
importance again I would say that in
 

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.400
importance again I would say that in
some of the humanities disciplines maybe

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:22.410
some of the humanities disciplines maybe
 

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:23.990
some of the humanities disciplines maybe
even in some of the social science

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000
even in some of the social science
 

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.420
even in some of the social science
disciplines that not that's not

00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:26.430
disciplines that not that's not
 

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:30.040
disciplines that not that's not
necessarily the way to go so as

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:30.050
necessarily the way to go so as
 

00:55:30.050 --> 00:55:32.800
necessarily the way to go so as
proponents of the monograph or as

00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:32.810
proponents of the monograph or as
 

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:36.170
proponents of the monograph or as
consumers who are keeping its survival

00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:36.180
consumers who are keeping its survival
 

00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:38.630
consumers who are keeping its survival
going I think that's one of the reasons

00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640
going I think that's one of the reasons
 

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:43.580
going I think that's one of the reasons
why I would say that the print monograph

00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:43.590
why I would say that the print monograph
 

00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:46.820
why I would say that the print monograph
is is not completely on its way out at

00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:46.830
is is not completely on its way out at
 

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:48.800
is is not completely on its way out at

that to my observations have led me to

00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:10.320
that to my observations have led me to
 

00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:14.750
that to my observations have led me to
believe that models for pricing coming

00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760
believe that models for pricing coming
 

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:20.140
believe that models for pricing coming
from our publishers have been fairly

00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:20.150
from our publishers have been fairly
 

00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:22.790
from our publishers have been fairly
known in the print world but these

00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:22.800
known in the print world but these
 

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.830

quite as understandable to us in the
 

00:57:27.600 --> 00:57:30.350
quite as understandable to us in the
electronic world so if material is going

00:57:30.350 --> 00:57:30.360
electronic world so if material is going
 

00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:33.680
electronic world so if material is going
to be born digital or be that ideal

00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:33.690
to be born digital or be that ideal
 

00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:37.280
to be born digital or be that ideal
digital book not a digitized version of

digital book not a digitized version of
 

00:57:37.290 --> 00:57:40.550
digital book not a digitized version of
a print book I think we have to see

00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:40.560
a print book I think we have to see
 

00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:42.440
a print book I think we have to see
where those price models are going to

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:42.450
where those price models are going to
 

00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:42.890
where those price models are going to
take

00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:42.900
take
 

00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:45.289
take
and how we will be able to continue to

00:57:45.289 --> 00:57:45.299
and how we will be able to continue to
 

00:57:45.299 --> 00:57:47.569
and how we will be able to continue to
afford to add those to the collection

00:57:47.569 --> 00:57:47.579
afford to add those to the collection
 

00:57:47.579 --> 00:57:50.750
afford to add those to the collection
and keep affording to add print

00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760
and keep affording to add print
 

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:52.789
and keep affording to add print
materials to the collection that we see

00:57:52.789 --> 00:57:52.799
materials to the collection that we see
 

00:57:52.799 --> 00:57:57.970
materials to the collection that we see
as valuable so these were my brief

00:57:57.970 --> 00:57:57.980
as valuable so these were my brief
 

00:57:57.980 --> 00:58:01.579
as valuable so these were my brief
observations based on the the library

00:58:01.579 --> 00:58:01.589
observations based on the the library
 

00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:05.180
observations based on the the library
view of where the monograph is right now

00:58:05.180 --> 00:58:05.190
view of where the monograph is right now
 

00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:09.430
view of where the monograph is right now
and i would say that within the

00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440
and i would say that within the
 

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:14.299
and i would say that within the
humanities in history realm there again

00:58:14.299 --> 00:58:14.309
humanities in history realm there again
 

00:58:14.309 --> 00:58:16.160
humanities in history realm there again
is still an expectation that this

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:16.170
is still an expectation that this
 

00:58:16.170 --> 00:58:18.200
is still an expectation that this
material will be in libraries i think

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:18.210
material will be in libraries i think
 

00:58:18.210 --> 00:58:19.370
material will be in libraries i think
there's still an expectation that

00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:19.380
there's still an expectation that
 

00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:22.640
there's still an expectation that
publishers will be out there looking for

00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:22.650
publishers will be out there looking for
 

00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:25.970
publishers will be out there looking for
quality material to bring to the

00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:25.980
quality material to bring to the
