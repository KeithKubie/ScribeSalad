00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
How did Galileo quantify motion in 2 dimensions? Well, he was a good scientist so he did an experiment.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This experiment involved rolling balls off of a the table and controlling

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the speed with which they rolled off the table and measuring where the ball landed.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Galileo controlled the speed of the ball by adjusting the height from which it rolled.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If he wanted it to go faster, he will roll it from higher up.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We'll talk later about how exactly he can know where to put the ball.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Galileo controlled the speed of the ball by adjusting where in the plane he released it from.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Higher up of course meant it would be going faster by the time it got to the edge of the table.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Like in his previous experiments, he didn't know

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the units of his velocity, but he knew their relative sizes.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
For example, he knew he can make the velocity twice as big as it was originally

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
or three or four times bigger and look what he found.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Again these are unit list distances but look at this correspondence.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
When the ball had a velocity of 1 unit, represented here, the trajectory looks something

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
like this. With a velocity of 2 units, the ball went twice as far.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Likewise with 3 and 4 units of initial horizontal velocity.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Galileo called this Vx. This x indicates an x direction.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
When we label axis, we usually called the horizontal direction x and the vertical y

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and so this x is just here to remind us that we're talking about a velocity in the horizontal direction.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Okay, this is pretty interesting. What's the conclusion that we can draw from this data?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Is it that the horizontal velocity is equal to the motion in the x direction?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
That horizontal velocity is somehow proportional to the motion in the x direction?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Or that horizontal velocity and x direction motion are totally unrelated?

00:01:34.000 --> 99:59:59.000
What's the best answer?
