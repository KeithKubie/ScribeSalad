00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So now, we have two hypotheses and we'd like to test them.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The null hypothesis is the basic hypothesis that something is correct

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and unless proven wrong, we always believe null hypothesis is actually correct,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
we trust the manufacturer or do we have sufficient evidence to be very high likelihood

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the null hypothesis is wrong, the alternate hypothesis is correct then,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
we reject the null hypothesis and we tell the manufacturer,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
please print the label on the box because the number there isn't quite correct.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So let's do it. To recap, we have sample 11 yeses and 4 nos.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And our null hypothesis is equals p=0.9 and our alternate hypothesis, if it doesn't work,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
as well as the null hypothesis, so p is smaller than 0.9.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This is a very exact to the setup you're going to study when we make hypothesis test.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
If you look at the sample and it's obvious this is binomial

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
which is the fancy word for coin flips, binary experiments.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
With 15 different experiments and under the null hypothesis  probably goes 0.9.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So obviously, in this binomial distribution, there are about 16 different outcomes from 0 to 15.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The most likely is 13, 14 is also pretty likely if the null hypothesis is correct,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and then the probability goes back to be down.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The key is assume that H₀ is actually correct, so the probability is 0.9,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
then FIND was called the critical region under which 5% or less

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
of the total probability of this binomial designs for different lane.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
You will place a mark over here that separates outcomes that invalidate the hypothesis

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and outcomes that validate the hypothesis, so that all the outcomes, together, left off this marker

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
collect in totality at most the confidence level, in this case 5%.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So that if you find an outcome that sits to the left of this point,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
you can say wow this outcome was so insanely unlikely under the null hypothesis, I just don't buy it.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
If conversely the outcome is somewhere in this green box and it isn't that unlikely after all.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Realize that each outcome itself might have a small likelihood,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
but you don't care about the probability of the outcome itself.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Even the maximum of the outcome has a small probability in this model.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
All you care about is putting a separator within and except this region

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and what's called the critical region and again the logic is

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
the critical region collects many possible outcomes, but in totality,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
these probabilities don't exceed the 5%.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So if the final outcome is in the critical region, you can confidently say,

00:02:45.000 --> 99:59:59.000
wow, I'm really surprised I don't buy that H₀ is correct.
