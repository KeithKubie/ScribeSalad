[THEME MUSIC]

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.760
So now that we've
created our achievements,

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.440
let's look at how we
can start unlocking

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.680
these things within the game.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.330
Now, I'm going to go back into
my game, and maybe the best way

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.210
for me to do this is put all
the achievement unlocking logic

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.150
into a second class.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.020
So I'm going to create
a new Objective C class.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.740
We're going to call it
Achievement Manager.

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.690
This looks like a
good place to put it.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.600
And we're all done.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.060
Now I'm going to
start off by declaring

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.680
just one public method here,.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.996
And it will be Unlock
Achievement with ID,

00:00:48.996 --> 00:00:52.810
and it will take an NS string
that is our achievement ID.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.510
And to implement
this, it's actually

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.640
pretty straightforward.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.940
Let's jump into our
AchievementManager.m file here.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.400
Once again, warning us that
this method is not found,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.530
and still looking
for that hotkey

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.040
where you can create a step
method to implement this.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.900
Someone help me out.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.630
Someone tell me in the comments.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.716
But in the meantime, we've got
some very easy tab completion.

00:01:16.716 --> 00:01:18.590
And we're going to assume
that in this method

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.150
we're going to be passed in
that Achievement ID, that string

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.810
that the developer console
gave us to uniquely identify

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.617
our achievement
within the system.

00:01:27.617 --> 00:01:29.450
So the first thing we're
going to want to do

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.360
is take this
achievement ID string

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.590
and get an actual
achievement object out of it.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.860
And so this achievement
is represented

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.630
as a GPG achievement object,
and we'll call it unlockMe.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.230
And we can create it by using
the GPGAchievement helper

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.090
method, AchievementWithId,
and we'll

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.480
pass in our Achievement ID.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.420
And at that point,
this unlockMe object,

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.510
which is an achievement
object associated

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.075
with a particular ID, we
can now call its method

00:02:00.075 --> 00:02:01.700
unlockAchievementWithCompletionHandler.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.350
Within our completion handler,
we get back two parameters.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.800
The first is a Boolean saying
whether this achievement has

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.200
been unlocked before, and the
second is an error object.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.180
So we can just add in some tests
for those, If Error, NSLog.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.290
Oh no, got an error.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.460
And we can see the error
localized description,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.010
something like that.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.000
Otherwise, If Newly Unlocked.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.890
Again, we could probably
unlock something

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.430
that says, hooray,
achievement unlocked.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:55.130
And otherwise, we can just
log something that says,

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:03.330
"looks like you've
earned this one already."

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.065
Close brackets.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.950
By the way, this
checking I'm doing here

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.080
for If Newly Unlocked
then do something,

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.730
otherwise don't
do anything, this

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.960
is purely for logging purposes.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.170
It's purely informative.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.687
There's nothing I need to
do with this information.

00:03:20.687 --> 00:03:22.270
Both the fact that
the achievement has

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.700
been unlocked will be
recorded on the server,

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.810
and that little toast
that pops up that says,

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.740
hey congratulations,
achievement unlocked,

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.780
here's the icon and
description, that's

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.860
handled for you automatically
by the game's library.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.020
So there's not actually
anything I need to do here.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.190
I'm just demonstrating
that we do

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.060
get some interesting information
back to us by the system.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.810
So now let's call this.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.610
And so I'm going to go
into our game model.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.230
And I guess the first thing
we need to do is let's import

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.660
this GMNAchievmentManager.

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.340
And we're going to make
a property nonatomic,

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.425
strong, Achievement Manager.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.756
And I suppose we can link and
perform some lazy instantiation

00:04:14.756 --> 00:04:15.255
here.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:30.420
We can say if not
Achievement Manager is nil,

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.010
then Achievement Manager
equals alloc init.

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.420
And then we can return
Achievement Manager.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.786
There you go, some nice
lazy instantiation.

00:04:44.786 --> 00:04:46.660
And now that we have
our Achievement Manager,

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.560
what we can do is, in
our Player Guessed area,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.960
if it turns out that the
player guessed correctly,

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.730
let's unlock the
first-timer achievement.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.790
So Achievement Manager, or
self.achievementManager,

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.000
I guess.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.025
Unlock achievement with ID.

00:05:04.025 --> 00:05:06.960
And we're going to have to
go back to our developer

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.640
console here, and we're going
to have to copy and paste

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:14.490
this first-timer code.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.270
Now, this is admittedly
a terrible style,

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.050
hard-coding this string right in
the middle of all of our code.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:24.754
And we'll fix this
up in a little bit,

00:05:24.754 --> 00:05:26.420
but for now I just
want to get something

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.780
working so we can
see what happens.

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.370
So there we go.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.720
That's all we need to do
to unlock an achievement.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.380
I suppose if I wanted I could
just embed all that code right

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.570
here in the game model.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.760
But I kind of like having
it as a separate class,

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.070
just because I do feel like
it's its own bit of logic.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:46.762
It deserves its own class.

00:05:46.762 --> 00:05:48.970
Maybe as a further refinement
we can make a singleton

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.220
or something if at some
point in the future

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:55.620
we need to access it from a
bunch of different classes.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.667
But for now, we've got this in.

00:05:57.667 --> 00:05:59.500
Let's see it in action
and see what happens.

00:06:02.294 --> 00:06:03.210
I'm going to run this.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:09.730
I'm signed in.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.970
Once again, let's
view our achievements.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:14.985
Looks like I haven't
earned any yet.

00:06:14.985 --> 00:06:15.985
Let's play an easy game.

00:06:19.992 --> 00:06:24.590
Higher than 50, lower than 75.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.685
I've gotten really
good at this game.

00:06:28.685 --> 00:06:30.730
Lower than 56.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:32.390
Let's do 53.

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:33.730
Lower than 53.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.390
What do you think, 52 or 51?

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.710
Let's do 52.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.640
Hey.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.519
And look at that.

00:06:38.519 --> 00:06:40.060
We got our achievement
unlocked toast

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.180
that appears right
on screen and then

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.100
fades out after a little bit.

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.630
We can go back to our main menu
here and view our achievements.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.620
And there it is unlocked.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.750
And it's now moved to
the top of my list,

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.780
because the unlocked
achievements generally

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.410
appear at the top.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.110
And I've now been
informed that I

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:00.530
have unlocked a total of one
out of four achievements.

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.680
So there you go.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.076
That's unlocking an achievement.

00:07:03.076 --> 00:07:05.200
Now that we're able to do
that, maybe the next step

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.360
is to increment an achievement.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.120
And we can look at incrementing
the Centiguesser achievement

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.070
in the next lesson.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:12.630
So I'll see you shortly.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:23.059
