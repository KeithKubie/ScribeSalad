00:00:00.453 --> 00:00:05.368
To compute the appropriate value of X, we divide I

00:00:05.368 --> 00:00:09.659
by the number of points fifty minus one, that’s

00:00:09.659 --> 00:00:14.945
important, minus one. I ranges from zero to forty

00:00:14.945 --> 00:00:20.633
nine, fifty points, zero to forty nine. The last I will be

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:24.799
forty nine, if I do five by forty nine the last value I get

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:29.419
here is one. So I divided by a number of points

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.264
minus one is a number that ranges from zero to one.

00:00:33.264 --> 00:00:37.655
Multiply that number by two pie that’s X. – X ranges

00:00:37.655 --> 00:00:42.993
from zero to precisely two pie and then I compute a

00:00:42.993 --> 00:00:46.993
sign and I compute the co-sign and that’s it.
