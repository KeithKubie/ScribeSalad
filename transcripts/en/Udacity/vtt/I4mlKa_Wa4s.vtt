[MUSIC]

00:00:03.304 --> 00:00:05.524
As we get to the end of this
orientation, we want to stop for

00:00:05.524 --> 00:00:07.650
a second and share some tips for
success with you.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.530
Some of these come from
instructors in the program.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.480
Some come from other
students in the program.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.460
But generally, we want to make sure we
give you everything you need to succeed

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.470
in this program.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.600
And part of that is letting you
know what has helped other students

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.680
succeed in the past as well.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.640
So we're going to share with
you some of their ideas.
