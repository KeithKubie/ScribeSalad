00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.290
The giant novelty check (cheque to our readers
of the non-American persuasion) is a comedy

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:12.040
staple, even if you’ve never been lucky
enough to handle one in real life, you’ve

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.080
likely drawn a cartoonishsly huge moustache
on a picture of someone holding one in a newspaper.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.080
(Just me?)

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.680
You’ve also probably found yourself thinking,
“can you actually cash that thing?” and

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.980
the answer is, you totally can… sort of.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.580
Though, it’s rather silly since you normally
get a regular sized check too with the big

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.580
one.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.682
Though cashing a check is a relatively simple
affair from the cashier’s perspective, the

00:00:26.682 --> 00:00:31.840
work on the back end is remarkably sophisticated
and involves an amazing amount of automated

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.690
technology and travel for the checks.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.490
With this in mind, it’s clear why virtually
all checks come in a fairly uniform size and

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:43.660
design- it’s just easier for everyone involved
that way.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.570
Though several million checks are sorted through,
by hand, every single year (usually due to

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.450
them being rejected by a machine for some
reason or another) this costs banks money,

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.609
so is obviously something they are very keen
to cut down on.

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:04.810
However, legally, there’s nothing stopping
you from writing a check on, well, anything,

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.550
such as a napkin, and then sending it to someone
you hate.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.550
In reality, however, it doesn’t always work
that way.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.550
For example, there are many, many colloquial
sources discussing the story of a disgruntled

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.550
man who wrote all the information for a check
onto a cow, then cashed it to annoy his bank.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.550
If that story sounds too amazing to be true,
it’s because it is.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.550
The story can be traced back to the very fictional
escapades of one, Albert Haddock, a character

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.550
created back in 1935 by the British author,
A.P. Herbert.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.550
As recounted by Snopes, despite being entirely
untrue, the story is often cited as an example

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.550
of unusual things people have carved checks
onto.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.550
It does raise an interesting issue of what
exactly a check is.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.550
According to Brian Black, onetime managing
director of operations and technology at the

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:18.550
Bank Administration Institute,

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.450
It [a check] has to contain certain features,
and it can be written on anything, as long

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.600
as it has the elements, the surface doesn’t
make a difference.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.120
A check is an order to pay someone, that’s
all it is.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.530
Basically, as long as whatever the check is
printed on, giant or otherwise, contains everything

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.960
necessary for it to be legally considered
a check (the amount to be paid; the payer

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.690
and payee names; the account number; the name
of the bank where the payer has the account

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.790
and what state the bank is in; the payer’s
signature, and the date the check was written),

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.470
it is a valid check.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.520
As Brian states, the check is an order to
pay someone, and it doesn’t have to be printed

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.430
on the pieces of paper the bank give you or
you bought from them; it’s just a lot easier

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:13.220
for the bank and the person cashing it if
they are.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:25.310
In regards to giant checks, when asked about
them, a spokeswoman for iWon online sweepstakes,

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.340
Samantha Better, said that their winners are
also given regular sized checks for their

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.720
own convenience that they can cash instead.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.730
Going on to say that most opt to keep their
giant check as a souvenir rather than go through

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.290
the hassle of actually trying to cash it.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.490
That being said, many banks have small print
in their terms stating that they can reject

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.520
any non-standard payments, so while the giant
novelty checks are technically legal and valid

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.520
to cash, those banks can, if they choose,
reject them.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.310
However, even if you did have the balls to
take your giant check to the bank and you

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:52.690
find they have no such internal rules against
it, they wouldn’t send it off in a suitably

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.690
giant envelope.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.400
Rather, they’d more likely simply take the
check, then write all the relevant information

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.960
down on some bank stationary and send it off
that way, which is far less interesting and

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.960
would result in you losing your awesome giant
talking piece.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.960
Since you almost certainly clicked this to
read about someone cashing a stupid check,

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.960
we want to tell you about, Patrick Combs.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.460
The man who, upon receiving a junk-mail check
for a little over $95,000, endorsed it with

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.480
a smiley face and then cashed it.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.220
To his surprise, his bank accidentally honored
it.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.850
Amazingly, because the bank failed to retract
their error within 24 hours of the check bouncing,

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.250
all $95,000+ was legally his.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.740
Since the check wasn’t valid, it came out
of the bank’s pocket.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.080
When news of Patrick’s hilarious feat of
getting one over on his bank hit the news,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.060
some of the finest legal minds in banking
joined the argument, on Patrick’s side.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.220
Essentially, Patrick was home free and in
full, legal possession of $95,000 of the bank’s

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.220
money.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.000
Of course, this didn’t stop the bank from
having their head of security threaten him,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.520
trying to get him to give the money back.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:47.390
But Patrick knew the law was on his side on
this one and had fun with it, telling the

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.640
security officer,

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.350
Give me a letter on official bank stationery
stating that you are who you say you are,

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.460
that you indeed work for the bank, and also
put in that letter the reason why the bank

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.680
is requesting the money back, as I’m a little
confused on that.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.960
When I get that letter, we’ll go from there.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:07.069
The security officer refused, apparently calling
Combs several choice names in the process.

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.410
Despite the threats, which actually made him
less inclined to give the money back, and

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.170
that at the time he had about $45,000 in credit-card
debt, Patrick eventually decided to return

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.170
it.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.730
He had meant it as a joke and didn’t actually
want to take any money from anyone, not the

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.140
bank or even the junk mailer who had sent
it to him.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.330
He didn’t come off too badly over the thing,
though.

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.480
To this day, he’s still riding the coattails
of the story to make a living in his 75 minute

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.860
Man 1, Bank 0 stage show.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.090
He was even once hired to perform the show
at a major banker’s conference.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.460
Presumably this functions as something of
a campfire horror story at banking executive

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:51.259
retreats.
