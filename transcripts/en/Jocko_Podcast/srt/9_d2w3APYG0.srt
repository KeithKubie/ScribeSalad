1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,350
There are no bad teams,
only bad leaders.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,310
Do you think there are exceptions to this?
If so,

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,610
how do you know you're
apart of the exception?

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,600
That is a quote from the book,

5
00:00:13,601 --> 00:00:16,870
extreme ownership written by
myself on my brother Leif Babin.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:22,330
And it is a quote that I don't
want to say we stole, but we stole.

7
00:00:22,331 --> 00:00:27,331
We appropriated from David
Hackworth who said there's no bad,

8
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,840
I think you said no bad officers,
no bad unit's only bad officers.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,400
And Napoleon who said there is no
bad regimens, only bad kernels.

10
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,140
And we said there's no bad teams,
only bad leaders. And the question is,

11
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:43,060
is there an exception to this?

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,080
And how do you know if you're part of
the exception? Well, actually there is,

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:52,110
there's a big exception to this and the
exception is that there are bad leaders

14
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:56,680
with good teams. That is
true. That can happen.

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,330
Sometimes you get a bad leader that
is running a really, really good team.

16
00:01:01,331 --> 00:01:03,730
So that's an exception.
I guess it's an exception to this rule.

17
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:06,530
Maybe that's the way I took it.
Uh,

18
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,820
so you get a team that's so good
that they just continue to perform.

19
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:12,910
Even though they have a horrible leader,

20
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:16,660
they perform despite their bad leader.
Gotcha.

21
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,550
Now what this doesn't,
this does not prove,

22
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,910
you know, I always say leadership is the
most important thing on the battlefield.

23
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,600
This doesn't disprove that statement.

24
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,870
You'd think maybe it does because oh well
you've got a bad leader and you've got

25
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:34,690
a good team. Then maybe leadership
hasn't been important. That's wrong.

26
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,900
Actually what it proves is that leadership
can come from any level inside the

27
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:41,880
organization.
That's what improves.

28
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,720
And it proves that because I've
seen that over and over again.

29
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:45,790
And when I was running the
training for the seal platoons,

30
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,620
eventually I didn't care where the
leadership in the platoon was because I

31
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,850
realized that it was a real,

32
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,390
it was a real hard thing to hope for
that you had the person that was in the

33
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:07,141
leadership positions like the platoon
commander or the platoon chief to to

34
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:14,050
assume or to figure that they were going
to be the leader that you wanted them

35
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,030
to be,
was a big assumption to make.

36
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,320
And so what I realized
after training for awhile,

37
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,940
it was like even though I wanted the
leaders to be those senior guys who were

38
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:23,050
supposed to be taking leadership,

39
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,250
eventually I realized as I didn't
care where that leadership came from,

40
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,350
as long as there was a
couple of good leaders,

41
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,310
you would end up with a good seal
platoon and a platoon would be on track.

42
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,930
Now maybe the question is what this
person is hinting at the exception being,

43
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,870
is there an exception that
if there is a bad team,

44
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,980
maybe that team is just so filled with
bad people that they can't get the job

45
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:48,220
done.

46
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,520
That's the kind of accepting you talk
about or failing because the team is so

47
00:02:51,521 --> 00:02:55,360
bad. Even though the leader's
good, even though the leaders good,

48
00:02:55,361 --> 00:03:00,250
but the team is so bad that that's an
exception to the, oh well guess what?

49
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,380
Who's responsible for
the people on the team?

50
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,880
Who's responsible for training the people
on the team so that they can get good

51
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:14,881
at their job and they can perform with
excellence or who's in charge of getting

52
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:19,840
rid of the people that are sub par so
that the team steps up their performance.

53
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,300
Well, by answered all those
questions is the leader.

54
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,850
So if you're on a bad team and you're
leading the team, it's your fault.

55
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,500
And there's no exceptions
to that. Yeah, zero. Yeah,

56
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,440
I'm over here trying to think of the
exception, but just what you said is like,

57
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,090
Eh, kind of, yeah. Kind of mitigates
any, hey, this, this, let's take a real,

58
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,440
a real simple example of like
a sports team, right? Oh,

59
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,000
this sports team got dealt a bad hand
and now the people on the team, well,

60
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:51,970
what are you gonna do? You're going to
train those people who's responsible?

61
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,130
I'm not saying you're going to
press start performing right now,

62
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:57,670
but you can get on the trajectory will,
you'll be good eventually.

63
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:00,490
Now if you just blame, hey, I
got a bad team. Well guess what?

64
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:02,680
Then you don't put an effort. Guess what?
You're going to continue to be a loser.

65
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,260
The exception. Yeah, but my
team, my team is just so bad. You

66
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,830
can't train your people.
I'm not saying you're a miracle worker.

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,840
I'm not saying you can.

68
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,610
You can take people that don't have
any skills and instantly through your

69
00:04:18,611 --> 00:04:23,470
leadership turned them into
incredible performers. No,
that's not going to happen.

70
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,850
But guess what?
As a leader,

71
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:27,100
you go out and you bring people
into your team that are good. Go.

72
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:30,400
You do train the people that you do have
up to the best of their abilities and

73
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:33,100
the people that can't perform the way
they need to perform. You get rid of them.

74
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,243
Yeah.

75
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:40,200
Yeah. That's it. No real
exceptions other than, yeah,

76
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:42,750
you can have a good team with bad leaders.
Yeah.

77
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:45,080
If only because there's a good
leader somewhere in there. You know,

78
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,710
the exceptions thing, I think
it's healthy, in my opinion.

79
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,460
None didn't go through this.
And most other things where if,

80
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:57,360
if I or we start thinking
that we're the exception,

81
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:01,510
so we don't have to put in like, I
don't know, like the work or whatever,

82
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,200
and not necessarily work with the, you
know, how like, okay, we'll take this on.

83
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:07,890
No bad teams don't leave
badly. Leaders. Ah, you know,

84
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,950
if I say I might be the exception
to this cause my team is so bad,

85
00:05:10,951 --> 00:05:14,700
it's Kinda like, yeah, aren't you kind of
do a little cop out there kind of thing.

86
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,340
100%

87
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,680
our bottom line is if you don't
take ownership of what's going on,

88
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:22,780
then you're not going to perform well.
If you just blame your genetics,

89
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,341
then that means,
okay,

90
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:27,270
well then I'm not going to get in any
kind of shape whatsoever. Then guess what?

91
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,660
Guess what kind of shape you're
being junk, substandard, substandard.
