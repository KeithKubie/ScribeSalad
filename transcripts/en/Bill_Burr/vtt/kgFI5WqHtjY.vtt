00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:01.621
Hey,

2
00:00:01.621 --> 00:00:04.920
what's going on it's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for

3
00:00:04.921 --> 00:00:09.921
Monday match 21st 2016 what's going on?

4
00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:14.490
How are you this wonderful gloomy Monday where I'm at.

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.300
It's gloomy out here. Chance a fucking shot,

6
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.570
which would be great. You know,

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.620
cause how it works out here in Los Angeles is we basically every three years we

8
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:29.970
get all of our rain for three years. Essentially. That is how it works.

9
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:33.300
And I know a lot of people think like, oh my God, that must be so wonderful.

10
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.400
You know, you wake up every day knowing the sun's gonna Shine,

11
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.720
it fucking drives you crazy after a while. Um, fortunately I travel enough.

12
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.280
I get on the road again, boom.

13
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.220
Took a bold all do meet and Trump fans and some bone for that old guy. Whatever.

14
00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:51.600
What the fuck is Bernie Sanders?

15
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.350
He wants to take all the money in from the fucking enrich and give it to the

16
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.930
bore and Donald Trump, he doesn't like Mexicans.

17
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.350
And Hillary's gonna drive right between those two fucking lunatics.

18
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.050
Ah, good Lord. Jesus fucking Christ. I haven't been watching,

19
00:01:10.051 --> 00:01:13.800
but I know that that's what's going to happen and all you broads out there who

20
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.240
are fucking excited to finally get a fucking clam into the fucking Oval Office.

21
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.680
Okay, I understand. I don't understand. I'm not a fucking woman.

22
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:26.430
I don't know what it's like to walk by a construction site and have a bunch of

23
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:30.060
people communicate that they find me sexually attractive. You know?

24
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.970
You know there is a positive way to look at that.

25
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.200
If you take away all the sexual assault vibe from it. It's kind of a, you know,

26
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.870
a nice tip of the construction cat. You know, I don't walk by and they go, Hey,

27
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.550
are you finding all the fuck I get nothing. I get nothing. I get silence.

28
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.200
I get snickers. Hey, fucking Casper. Right. I may make fun of,

29
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:54.100
my lack of mellow is a Melatonin pigment. Melatonin isn't that fucking a,

30
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.660
I forget if that's a fruit and that's not the skin cancer.

31
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.420
Don't you need Melatonin? Oh Jesus. Who gives a fuck? I'm just saying, right.

32
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.580
Just because somebody has a vagina,

33
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.810
does it mean because you also have a vagina that they are going to do what's

34
00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:19.890
right for you? Think about all the presidents that have had dicks,

35
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.470
which is far as I know has been all of them, but you never know. You never know.

36
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.790
You never know. Back in the day there were no cell phone pictures, right.

37
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.810
There was no video cameras. You had no idea. You know, I,

38
00:02:36.811 --> 00:02:38.820
you know Andrew Jackson, he could have been like, you know,

39
00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:41.340
he looks like one of those broads on fucking, uh,

40
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.160
the fluoxetine when that showed the golden girls,

41
00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.520
he looked like one of the golden girls, sort of their hip or younger one.

42
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.530
You know, he really had that middle of the ground, you know, that.

43
00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.700
Is it a chick? Is it a dude? Roger Daltrey early eighties haircut,

44
00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.820
you know, except it was a problem wig over there. Um,

45
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.140
yeah, I mean,

46
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.660
<v 1>okay.</v>

47
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.990
<v 0>I'm just saying just because somebody has the same fucking thing as you does not</v>

48
00:03:09.991 --> 00:03:13.350
mean that they're going to do what's good for you or that you're now going to

49
00:03:13.351 --> 00:03:17.940
get more stuff like clog cheese in the White House.

50
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.710
Doesn't that mean I get a corner office? No, it doesn't. Fuck.

51
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.850
Do you have to do with her?

52
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.130
I got to admit, yeah. If I see a red edit achieved something,

53
00:03:30.131 --> 00:03:32.050
I don't feel excited like, oh,

54
00:03:32.051 --> 00:03:35.830
it's only a matter of time before that comes around my way and I know what

55
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:39.040
you're thinking. Oh, well we'll build. It's not like redheads are a minority.

56
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.450
Yes, we are an unseen minority. I told you,

57
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.950
walking amongst you, listening in on your conversation for reading your emails.

58
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.210
We're here, man. What? From another port from fucking Mars, the Red Planet.

59
00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:56.650
That's what we came from. We came here, right? We look just like you guys,

60
00:03:56.651 --> 00:03:59.560
but then we fucked up when we ended the atmosphere, right?

61
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.730
We got a little fucking singed up there and burned our pubes.

62
00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:07.590
<v 1>Okay.</v>

63
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.640
<v 0>Oh my God. It's a fucking gloomy day. It is a good God damn gloomy day.</v>

64
00:04:11.641 --> 00:04:16.230
I hope the fucking goddamn clouds part. Um,

65
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.490
anyways, all the or freckles is looking for a new car.

66
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.630
I'm looking for a new car, baby, a new car.

67
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.250
And I gotta admit, I actually feel like I'm a, you know,

68
00:04:29.251 --> 00:04:31.230
like leaving the Prius behind. You know,

69
00:04:31.231 --> 00:04:35.280
I've had a an almost eight years with the thing runs like a fucking top.

70
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.990
I Dunno, I just want to get something new. I got a buddy who might buy it.

71
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.130
I Dunno. I'm a frugal son of a bitch. I'm probably just going to go look.

72
00:04:44.131 --> 00:04:44.964
But you know, it's a good,

73
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.230
a good time to look for a fucking car is on a rainy day. You know,

74
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.880
all those fucking tool shed fucking salesman. They're the worst.

75
00:04:53.881 --> 00:04:58.881
The carsick car Smith salesman are the lowest of the low of fucking salespeople.

76
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.180
And you know what's funny? They know it. They wouldn't even lie,

77
00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.110
but if they know what the fuck they do, I mean, they,

78
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.470
they're like one rung below a drug dealer.

79
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.443
<v 1>Okay.</v>

80
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.330
<v 0>At least with drugs, you know, you get some sort of a high, oh,</v>

81
00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:19.960
I guess when you buy a car you do, you know, I don't know fucking they,

82
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:21.330
they are just like, I don't know.

83
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.070
The great thing is is I really don't need a car. So I'm in a great negotiating,

84
00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.100
a negotiable negotiator negotiating all position. I'm just gonna walk,

85
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.120
go and be like, yeah, I liked that and this is what I'm going to pay at a,

86
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:40.170
so go discuss it with your manager and come back and come back with that number

87
00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.290
of something less or I'm just going to get my car.

88
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.330
You trade that in now I could sell it to my buddy or I can just drive across the

89
00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:53.160
street, not take on all this fucking debt and just go get myself a ham sandwich.

90
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.000
Huh? What do you say? They're stupid, ty.

91
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.270
Go talk to your manager. Um,

92
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.310
I always talk a good game and then I go in there and I get fucked up because at

93
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:08.090
the end of the day, I just, I don't want to be there and it's just,

94
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:11.210
I don't give a shit if it costs me a few grand more. It's like,

95
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.390
how much more do I have to pay to get you to shut the fuck up? And they know it.

96
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.920
You know what I mean? You'll be a women.

97
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:18.840
Talk about how guys just wear them down sometimes and they just,

98
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.800
they just sort of blow 'em to shut them up and just get them on their way.

99
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.960
That's what car salesman do to me now. They don't blow me. They, uh,

100
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.850
they just fought. They do wear me down though.

101
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:33.770
They fucking wear me down and I'm just like, f you know, I, I don't, okay.

102
00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.730
I mean, when I bought my Prius, I was just like, I went in, I said, listen,

103
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.530
I'm paying this and that's it. And then I go, well,

104
00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:42.410
we're not giving you it for that. It's a hot car. We sell like three a day.

105
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.440
And I'm like, well then I'm leaving. And then they go, all right.

106
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.920
And then I went, all right, I'll pay what you want me to.

107
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.690
I am the fucking worst.

108
00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:59.330
I want all you salesmen to know that a sucker just went through the doe.

109
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.520
Um, that's going to be Megan about fucking two hours. Um, alright,

110
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.520
where the hell am I? What am I talking? Oh,

111
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.340
you know what's I'm actually really enjoying. I actually had a cigar.

112
00:07:10.341 --> 00:07:14.450
I told you for the first time and I gotta admit I kind of didn't. I liked it.

113
00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.040
I liked it, did it, but there was way more. Um,

114
00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.100
I don't like this shitty taste in my fucking mouth the next day.

115
00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:22.851
Then there was that.

116
00:07:22.851 --> 00:07:27.800
I enjoyed that and I am on the precipice of, uh,

117
00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.840
just straight up quitting those fucking things,

118
00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.440
which should make me feel really good to be honest with you. Like I said,

119
00:07:33.441 --> 00:07:36.260
if I keep smoking these things this summer, I'm a four year smoker.

120
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:40.340
Something I never thought I'd be, now I'm not going to start crying right now.

121
00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:43.670
Like some broad that just won an award pretending to be a nurse on, you know,

122
00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.530
some fucking show you like me. You really like,

123
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:53.030
um, I don't, uh, I don't need that shit in my life,

124
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:56.480
although I gotta admit I've, I do enjoy, do I enjoy them?

125
00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.190
I think I remember that I enjoyed the last one I had. I liked, I liked it,

126
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:03.110
but I didn't afterwards I was like, Whoa,

127
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:07.940
Jesus Christ is fucking taste in my mouth. So, um,

128
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.133
<v 1>okay.</v>

129
00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:15.120
<v 0>Did you guys consider me a smoker? If I smoked one new year's Day,</v>

130
00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.450
the Superbowl, my birthday,

131
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:24.120
and then on one of those Jewish holidays in September, I needed,

132
00:08:24.121 --> 00:08:27.510
I needed for sick and like once every three months, what the fuck? Hey,

133
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:30.960
my birthday's June, so I come out of the gate, right? Boom.

134
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.240
January 1st I smoked one,

135
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:37.950
and then February 3rd is the super Superbowl and then it's nothing in March.

136
00:08:37.951 --> 00:08:41.760
Nothing in April, nothing in May. And then in June for my birthday, Bam,

137
00:08:41.761 --> 00:08:45.870
I smoke one. And then, um, I don't know,

138
00:08:45.871 --> 00:08:47.850
maybe that big college game I go to every year,

139
00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:50.213
<v 1>you know,</v>

140
00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.470
<v 0>I dunno. I have no idea. I think you know, oh,</v>

141
00:08:53.471 --> 00:08:54.940
I remember what the fuck I was going to tell you.

142
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.620
Remember I was telling you last time there was something I wanted to tell you

143
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:01.560
but I, I couldn't remember what it was. Um,

144
00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.520
I tried to make Gnocchi the other night. Did I tell you that?

145
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:09.480
And Yawkey however the fuck you say, what a Goddamn fucking disaster.

146
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:15.600
Fucking disaster. You know what? This is base. It just tasted like,

147
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.010
you don't just imagine what cookie dough would taste like minus everything that

148
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:23.970
makes it tastes good. It was just blobs of shit.

149
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.500
Blobs of flour. Um, what happened was went blues.

150
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:30.960
I was a,

151
00:09:30.961 --> 00:09:34.500
I went on the Internet and I was watching these fucking chefs make this shit.

152
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.110
And what they do is when they go to mix it,

153
00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:41.430
they fast forward through it or they just jump cut because they feel that it's

154
00:09:41.431 --> 00:09:44.640
boring and that no one's going to watch the rest of it.

155
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:49.860
And that right there, that's the key right there.

156
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:52.500
It's like they open the playbook and then they just go,

157
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.500
they fan through every fucking page and then they'll like,

158
00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.890
and that's the game plan for the, they were going to run this season.

159
00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:03.770
Any questions on to, on to ready break. Right. And you're like, what the I,

160
00:10:03.771 --> 00:10:07.410
what the fuck just happened? So, um, I,

161
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:10.080
I believe they got me so fucking paranoid.

162
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:15.690
I watched this Mario Batali one where, uh, he had his friend do it and um,

163
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.000
you know, he's got, he's going to show you to make Gnocchi. You,

164
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.660
you just look it up. Just look at Mario Vitaly fucking blah, blah blah.

165
00:10:21.661 --> 00:10:26.040
You'll see the thing, they fly through him mixing the shit. And uh,

166
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:29.460
but the big thing that kept saying was, is don't over mix it. Don't over mix it.

167
00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:32.700
You're gonna get a tough pass day, Yada, Yada, Yada, Yada, Yada, Yada,

168
00:10:32.701 --> 00:10:36.120
and all that shit. And these fucking assholes. They just,

169
00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.190
they blew right through it. And then I under mixed it,

170
00:10:38.191 --> 00:10:40.320
I forgot and I'm starting to feel like I already told you this one.

171
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:45.960
I told you this, right. And he said, you should make pasta anymore, you know,

172
00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.760
there you go. There's my supportive wife. I swear to God.

173
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.480
Do you ever wonder why the woman that loves you is always shitting on everything

174
00:10:54.481 --> 00:10:58.500
that you do? You know, not everything you do, but anything new, you're trying.

175
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.790
They fucking shit all over you. You know what I think that is?

176
00:11:02.791 --> 00:11:07.260
I think that that is some sort of fucking paranoia within a relationship.

177
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.770
Maybe guys do it too. I never dated a guy, you know?

178
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:14.810
You know what I think I'm going to try this summer. So

179
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:19.770
you guys still like me. If I dated a guy for like three fucking months,

180
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:23.400
you know what? If I dated like my doppelganger,

181
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:26.460
I'm trying to get with most fucked up image you could possibly see to me.

182
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:31.290
I'll date that guy from fucking, uh, uh, we're all wacky in the house over here.

183
00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:34.250
Whatever the fuck the name of that show is, you know? Oh, look at you. You're,

184
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:38.800
you're fucking, uh, I'm from Malaysia. Look at me. I like show tunes.

185
00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:43.920
Eh? I'm the old school guy from fucking the Korean War. Right.

186
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.150
My describing my cartoon. I can't remember. Anyways. Um,

187
00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:54.050
the fuck was I just talking about? Oh God damn

188
00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:54.131
<v 2>it.</v>

189
00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:56.920
My fucking brain just goes in one straight line and you just got to keep going.

190
00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.170
I gotta keep going. If I come back around again, it's just like,

191
00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:00.770
I don't even know where the fuck I was. Ed.

192
00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.470
Backup backup was before dating a guy for three months, but it was after gloomy,

193
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:11.800
gloomy fucking weather. So after the car, crooked car salesman,

194
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.510
C'mon Billy coming around the mountain. You come around the mountain.

195
00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.610
We going up and down. Lou, remember that Mary Tyler Moore,

196
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:23.530
when Lou grant had a great fucking idea and he just forgot about it as a man,

197
00:12:23.531 --> 00:12:26.790
I had the best idea and Mary Tyler Moore is trying to get them to remember.

198
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:29.050
She goes, okay, okay. You're in the elevator. You're in the ability.

199
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.090
You coming up, you coming up here and you're going, yeah, yeah, yeah.

200
00:12:31.091 --> 00:12:34.210
I was in the elevator. She goes, yeah, you know, you, you press the floor,

201
00:12:34.340 --> 00:12:35.170
you coming up,

202
00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:38.080
you're in the elevator and you would think it ain't right as he almost gets it.

203
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.410
Ted Baxter just leans in, he goes, well, you're going up or down low.

204
00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:46.900
Oh, speaking of that shit. You know what I watched the other day,

205
00:12:46.901 --> 00:12:48.940
I watched an episode of Gilligan's island,

206
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:53.560
the ones that were in black and white instead of watching march madness,

207
00:12:53.561 --> 00:12:56.200
because I don't like the first couple of rounds.

208
00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:57.790
I know there's all those upsets,

209
00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:02.290
but I don't like watching fucking bunker hill community college playing Duke.

210
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.860
I know every once in awhile they get beat and I guess there was a bunch of

211
00:13:05.861 --> 00:13:10.240
fucking upsets, you know? I know that one fucking that that uh,

212
00:13:10.241 --> 00:13:14.980
that Austin Austin city limits college with that fucking,

213
00:13:14.981 --> 00:13:17.020
I couldn't tell if he was a lumberjack or a hipster,

214
00:13:17.021 --> 00:13:21.310
that fucking jacked white dude with the psycho beard man and the Hitler youth

215
00:13:21.311 --> 00:13:22.240
haircut. I was like,

216
00:13:22.241 --> 00:13:27.070
that guy needs to one more wind and the other team fucking tipped it in and they

217
00:13:27.071 --> 00:13:28.570
lost right at the fucking plaza.

218
00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:34.050
But I was thinking that guy needs to get to one more round and he is going to be

219
00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:36.250
a, he's going to be famous. You know,

220
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.610
I just seen that cause I was looking like I, uh,

221
00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:43.030
I remember who he is and I assumed if I remember then everybody else's going to

222
00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:46.000
remember because, you know, why wouldn't the whole world think the way I think?

223
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:48.880
Well Shit, maybe I should run for president.

224
00:13:48.881 --> 00:13:51.400
I think when you have thoughts like that, that means that you're,

225
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:54.040
you're designed to be a world leader.

226
00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.790
I have great ideas and I think everybody,

227
00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.660
why wouldn't everybody like my ideas and everybody should think the way I think.

228
00:14:01.661 --> 00:14:05.320
And everybody will be good if I'm running stuff, you know,

229
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:07.450
and everybody will get the same amount of stuff,

230
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.810
except I'll get a little bit more and buy a little bit more.

231
00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.410
I mean a bunch of hoes, a bunch of doughs.

232
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.880
It's something else about my toes. Um, well, you know what, I,

233
00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.980
I can't remember what the fuck I was talking about. I was,

234
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:25.770
did start talking about basketball, but you know, some,

235
00:14:25.771 --> 00:14:27.880
they actually have in a little bit of match madness.

236
00:14:27.881 --> 00:14:32.470
The Madness of March is coming down to a Anaheim. And,

237
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:36.850
um, I heard the, uh, the Duke guys that Dubois,

238
00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:41.590
Tam Duke Board, we come right back. [inaudible]

239
00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.980
um, are come to Anaheim at the Hondas.

240
00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:51.230
I think I'm going to go to that. You know who's getting who?

241
00:14:51.231 --> 00:14:54.860
I've got two huge fucking shows coming up this weekend.

242
00:14:56.090 --> 00:15:00.650
One in river side and the other one at the terrorists theater in Long Beach,

243
00:15:00.651 --> 00:15:02.660
California, which is really no big deal.

244
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.830
It's just a beautiful theater that Richard Pryor, uh,

245
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.900
taped his first big special and that's all I'll just be standing on the same

246
00:15:11.001 --> 00:15:14.330
stage. No reason to prepare or be nervous for that one.

247
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:17.150
I'm freaking out about that one. I'm not going to lie to you guys.

248
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.330
I just feel like I'm already putting all this pressure on myself that if I don't

249
00:15:20.331 --> 00:15:25.080
have the fucking, um, my show of shows dead.

250
00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.910
Uh, I dunno the comedy God's going to be like, yeah, it is.

251
00:15:28.911 --> 00:15:30.170
These comedians nowadays, you know,

252
00:15:30.171 --> 00:15:32.990
they're all still in a bunch of fucking tickets, but they then they, they stink.

253
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.510
They're not the real deal. Um,

254
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:37.380
<v 1>okay.</v>

255
00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:41.430
<v 2>But anyways, uh, I'm thinking if I, if I go out tonight,</v>

256
00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:46.260
tomorrow and Wednesday, right? Do a couple of two. Three.

257
00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:51.150
Okay. And then Thursday. All right. I hit the Duke game,

258
00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:57.240
Dan on fucking a Friday to get my show and Saturday got my show and just knock

259
00:15:57.241 --> 00:15:58.950
those out. I feel like I'll be all right.

260
00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:02.910
I feel like I can take one fucking day off. You know? Am I nuts?

261
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.630
My nuts? Because I didn't last night. This is the thing,

262
00:16:06.631 --> 00:16:11.010
I stopped smoking cigars. So you know what happens when you quit a bad habit?

263
00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.700
Something else fucking goes through the goddamn roof. You know what I mean?

264
00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:19.950
It's like if you quit smoking, you start eating right? You stop boozing,

265
00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:24.360
you start shooting smack, right? You say,

266
00:16:24.361 --> 00:16:27.270
I'm going to start cleaning up around the house. Next thing you know,

267
00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:31.980
you're beating your wife and you know why? It's because nobody is perfect.

268
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.040
You have to go to a fucking AA meeting.

269
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:39.270
They're all in their fucking chain smoking and fucking shoving donuts down their

270
00:16:39.271 --> 00:16:43.770
throat. This still killing themselves. They just slid it over to something else.

271
00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.280
That's basically, um,

272
00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:47.910
<v 1>yeah,</v>

273
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:52.680
<v 2>the most fascinating people I find is the people that are just 100% straight</v>

274
00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.660
edge and they eat like a micro macrobiotic, microbial, whatever the fuck it is.

275
00:16:57.661 --> 00:17:00.930
Macrobiotic diet. I'm gonna say macro. You say macro.

276
00:17:00.931 --> 00:17:04.660
I say micro beet DAPA. Dupo um,

277
00:17:05.490 --> 00:17:08.670
those fucking people, but you know what it is and they don't do anything.

278
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:10.603
<v 1>Okay.</v>

279
00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:16.260
<v 2>They fucking, you know, they drink fucking,</v>

280
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.070
you know,

281
00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:21.630
pure the most purified fucking water out of a Unicorn's horn or some shit.

282
00:17:21.631 --> 00:17:26.460
Right. Just the most, the most fucking, cleanest living ever. But you know what?

283
00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:30.580
They probably killed themselves with the stress of knowing they're still gonna

284
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.433
die.

285
00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:32.693
<v 1>You know?</v>

286
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.240
<v 2>How, how, how do you think you treat yourself when you really think about it?</v>

287
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:41.240
I think I treat myself like a,

288
00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:46.580
I wouldn't say the way I treat a rental car. I treat around car pretty good.

289
00:17:46.670 --> 00:17:48.830
I don't beat the shit out of it. When I was younger, I used to,

290
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:50.263
and it was just funny.

291
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.840
<v 0>They'd give you a car and you just, you know,</v>

292
00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:53.410
<v 1>okay.</v>

293
00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:56.260
<v 0>Remember a neutral drops for some reason, we're considered fucking amazing.</v>

294
00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.710
You know, you just have it in park. You would, oh no,

295
00:17:59.711 --> 00:18:02.830
you put a neutral Bagel bill, neutral dropping. You would just floor it,

296
00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:07.120
get the rpms up to a bought, oh, I don't know, seven, 8,000.

297
00:18:07.121 --> 00:18:10.210
And then you would just slam it into fucking drive.

298
00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:15.390
And you just heard that horrific sound of,

299
00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:18.590
I dunno what the fuck it is on an automatic Tricia transmission, you know,

300
00:18:18.591 --> 00:18:23.591
with the standard would be the collection that fucking engaging in whatever the

301
00:18:23.841 --> 00:18:25.460
fucking engages in. I don't fucking know.

302
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:29.840
Basically gears in slamming into other gears.

303
00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:35.200
I can't believe the teeth just don't fly off on both sides.

304
00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:39.490
I imagine that eventually they do. But, uh, we used to do shit like that. Uh,

305
00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:42.670
you know, you take the car off road,

306
00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:46.540
you could do a lot of shit back in the day before everybody had a fucking

307
00:18:46.541 --> 00:18:51.070
camera, you know. Oh. Speaking of which, I gotta tell you what,

308
00:18:51.071 --> 00:18:53.830
I fucking saw it. Oh my God. I almost forgot to tell you this fucking story.

309
00:18:53.831 --> 00:18:56.500
Let me do a little advertising here first. Oh, look at that. A little teaser.

310
00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:00.940
Um, remind me to talk about the, uh,

311
00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:06.480
the fucking local fucking wine thing I went on with my wife,

312
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:11.470
mother-in-law law, my brother in law. Um, all right.

313
00:19:11.471 --> 00:19:13.420
Where the fuck is he advertising here for this week.

314
00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:14.283
<v 1>Okay.</v>

315
00:19:14.910 --> 00:19:19.050
<v 0>If you knew Susie, like I knew Susie. Oh. Oh.</v>

316
00:19:19.051 --> 00:19:22.890
What a gal to love are they just kind of calling her a whore? Oh,

317
00:19:22.891 --> 00:19:23.970
if you knew where the way I knew her.

318
00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:25.380
<v 1>Okay.</v>

319
00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:28.590
<v 0>You mean you fucked her? Um, all right. Me On ds.</v>

320
00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:33.800
Me d is dry and out. Your fucking clams. Me On bees.

321
00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:35.903
Me Young Ds.

322
00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:36.890
<v 1>Okay.</v>

323
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.290
<v 0>The butcher's name was fucking Sam.</v>

324
00:19:39.291 --> 00:19:43.400
He was banging in Alison or clam was dry. He thought he was doing his job.

325
00:19:43.401 --> 00:19:46.830
He didn't know why she had the first pair of fucking me undies.

326
00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.990
That was 1968. So they broke up. If you asked me,

327
00:19:50.991 --> 00:19:55.770
I thought she went down a different road. I mean,

328
00:19:55.771 --> 00:19:57.730
she was a lesbian. All right. [inaudible]

329
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.700
whether you're wearing a suit or sweats,

330
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:07.090
you spend almost 24 hours a day in your underwear unless you're an animal or a

331
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:08.600
Matthew mcconaughey, right.

332
00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:13.540
But instead of making a statement like Superman's tights under his clothes every

333
00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.880
day, um, your underwear is probably boring.

334
00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.440
[inaudible] is here to change that. Um, please include the following.

335
00:20:21.441 --> 00:20:23.840
I'm going to, it's pronounced modal.

336
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:30.010
Every pair of me undies is made from sustained from sustainably sourced modal of

337
00:20:31.701 --> 00:20:34.100
fabric that's twice as soft as cotton. Now,

338
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:38.980
can somebody tell me where the fuck this shit came from? This is,

339
00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:41.330
this is from a lab, you know what I mean?

340
00:20:41.331 --> 00:20:44.090
Please tell me there's not a group of people that are forced to go out. Yeah.

341
00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:46.940
Under the fields in pick modal. You know,

342
00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:52.420
God knows there's going to be some great music that comes out of that one. Um,

343
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:57.490
nothing can describe the fit and feel of me undies me undies dry and out your

344
00:20:57.491 --> 00:21:00.760
ball bag. Uh, but once you try them on,

345
00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:05.500
you'll understand why they're called the world's most comfortable underwear.

346
00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:08.770
Underwear, underwear. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Um,

347
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.500
and if you don't love your first pair of me undies, they're free.

348
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.600
No questions asked. I don't understand that.

349
00:21:13.601 --> 00:21:16.060
Why would you keep a pair of [inaudible]? Cause you can't give them back.

350
00:21:17.050 --> 00:21:21.710
You know, you can't have your dried up fucking genital sweat in those, in the,

351
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:25.420
in the undercarriage of those things. You can't resell those. Sure. You can't.

352
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:29.050
You put them on the Internet for those fucking people that like to sniff other

353
00:21:29.051 --> 00:21:29.884
people's underwear.

354
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.960
What is with those people where they had dog in their past life?

355
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:37.840
What the fuck is wrong with them? I bet they're noses are cold.

356
00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:42.010
The perverts have cold noses. Um, anyways,

People feel really stupid. I don't think it does.

377
00:22:56.091 --> 00:22:57.430
I think it just makes him frustrated.

378
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:01.450
I think you just wrote there cause it sounded good with the copy it built.

00:23:14.651 --> 00:23:18.250
You're always leading around the house but can't seem to find anything in

384
00:23:18.251 --> 00:23:22.990
seconds. Do you beat your children with a wooden spoon? Do they try and hide it?

Even when it's on silent. You know,

392
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.920
I just realized somebody is going to kill their spouse with a blunt object in

393
00:23:48.921 --> 00:23:51.440
the house and then they're going to take it and they're going to throw it in the

394
00:23:51.441 --> 00:23:52.274
river,

395
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:56.180

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:37.000
so anyways, uh, who's [inaudible] me mother in laws birthday and uh,

439
00:26:37.001 --> 00:26:40.270
it got rained out like a month or two ago. So we finally rescheduled this thing.

440
00:26:40.271 --> 00:26:43.300
We went on the one of these wine trips out here to Malibu.

441
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.900
<v 2>Um, and they have these giant fucking like 600 acre ranches out there.</v>

442
00:26:48.901 --> 00:26:50.070
Cause I w I used to always, you know,

443
00:26:50.071 --> 00:26:54.570
whenever I'm flying by and I always look over and see all that fucking that

444
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:59.070
there's basically no place to land. You know, I was kinda thinking like, wow,

445
00:26:59.071 --> 00:27:01.590
that's amazing that it hasn't been developed.

446
00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.020
I guess because they're all fucking ranches. Eventually,

447
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.540
eventually they'll get rid of all the fucking grapes and we'll turn it into a

448
00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.360
giant fucking, I don't know. I don't know what the fuck you call it,

449
00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:15.240
apartment complexes or whatever. So anyways,

450
00:27:15.241 --> 00:27:17.820
so we go up there and first of all it's so up in the fucking hills,

451
00:27:17.821 --> 00:27:22.530
like the gps isn't working and it actually ends up taking us to this,

452
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.670
this fucking parole board thing that's in the middle there.

453
00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:28.230
They got the barbwire fence,

454
00:27:28.231 --> 00:27:30.990
it looked like minimum security thing that we went into. Like, all right,

455
00:27:30.991 --> 00:27:33.480
I don't think this is the fucking a wine place.

456
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:38.850
So we ended up going back and they have on the farm, you know,

457
00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:42.210
they have a place we can just go get boozed, you know, boozed up,

458
00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.750
listen to some bands and that type of shit. And uh, you know,

459
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.290
there's something about wine drinkers. You just don't want to be around them.

460
00:27:49.291 --> 00:27:53.190
I don't know. It gives you a brutal fucking hangover. I like a nice glass,

461
00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:56.400
you know, sound like fucking what's his face?

462
00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.200
Start talking about fava beans and somebody's liver. Um,

463
00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:03.630
I look at a nice glass with a meal, but that's about it. But um, anyways,

464
00:28:03.631 --> 00:28:06.840
so they also have like a safari up there. They have like yaks,

465
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:10.860
they have this fucking Giraffe, they have camels, they had these, he moves.

466
00:28:10.861 --> 00:28:12.420
They had all this crazy shit,

467
00:28:12.421 --> 00:28:14.400
you could go up and feed him and all that type of stuff.

468
00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:18.930
So we're up there having a great time meeting these fucking yaks and zebras and

469
00:28:18.931 --> 00:28:22.950
stuff. And um, and of course, you know,

470
00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:27.360
they've got these giant bull like things and this is fucking jerk off

471
00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:30.780
with these one of these guys, you know,

472
00:28:30.781 --> 00:28:35.040
that bought like the top of the line loafers, you know,

473
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:37.830
but they're loafers. They're these really, these fucking, you know,

474
00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.310
it's the kind of Shit Rick Flare would buy as a joke, right?

475
00:28:41.311 --> 00:28:44.100
Just so we can hold them in some broke guy's face and say that his shoes cost

476
00:28:44.101 --> 00:28:46.560
more than a house. But this guy was like serious and he's wearing them.

477
00:28:46.561 --> 00:28:48.270
There's like dirt on the ground, obviously.

478
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:50.610
He's walking around and so all of a sudden, you know,

479
00:28:50.611 --> 00:28:53.910
I'm over feeding a fucking Yak and all of a sudden I heard the unmistakable

480
00:28:53.911 --> 00:28:58.560
sound of a bull hitting the fucking metal rail of offense.

481
00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.480
I don't know why I know that sound.

482
00:29:00.481 --> 00:29:05.481
I think it's part of the fucking a caveman DNA that's still left in everybody

483
00:29:06.181 --> 00:29:08.450
that you, you know, where you just, it's,

484
00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:10.710
you haven't ever like walk down the street and all of a sudden dogs behind a

485
00:29:10.711 --> 00:29:15.640
fence in a growls in your whole body just fucking gets that tingle and you come

486
00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:18.120
with, like I'm telling you, if you don't,

487
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.630
if you started running right then you probably could run as fast as Bo Jackson.

488
00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:26.760
You know, that's how fast boat Jackson could run just to gain four yards.

489
00:29:27.150 --> 00:29:31.320
He ran as fast as someone would run if a saber tooth tiger was fucking about

490
00:29:31.321 --> 00:29:34.890
ready to eat him, you know, that first fucking step. Um,

491
00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:40.140
anyways, I heard that sound and immediately I just felt I was just,

492
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.160
I was already being, all right, I'm going to get fucking

493
00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.200
<v 0>trampled or worst case scenario,</v>

494
00:29:44.201 --> 00:29:47.680
this thing's gonna Hook under my belt and my fucking pants are going to go down

495
00:29:47.681 --> 00:29:52.300
to my ankles is my junk is flapping around like that poor bested everybody sees,

496
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:56.260
oh, that guy's life is over. He's fucked. There's no way to laugh that off.

497
00:29:56.261 --> 00:29:59.650
You ever seen that one? The bull fucking gets into the guy's belt loop,

498
00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:04.150
tips them upside down and just is thrashing them around.

499
00:30:04.151 --> 00:30:06.190
The guy's pants go all the way down to his ankles.

500
00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:09.550
And people went from being like, oh my God, that's going to die to everybody.

501
00:30:09.551 --> 00:30:13.660
Just sitting there laughing at this guy and you know, he's thinking like,

502
00:30:13.661 --> 00:30:17.680
oh my God, this thing's gonna Gore my fucking Dick. Right? And all in,

503
00:30:17.681 --> 00:30:21.760
you know that chick that he finally got the fucking courage to try to get,

504
00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:26.260
you know, the courage to ask up, ask up, ask out, up, out,

505
00:30:26.261 --> 00:30:29.200
over in whatever he wanted to take this bitch out, right?

506
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:33.220
So he probably was awkward. So he's going like, you know what,

507
00:30:33.221 --> 00:30:35.850
I'll do something amazing and then that'll give her my attention.

508
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:38.860
I'll show you how courageous I am. Right?

509
00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.460
So he runs with the fucking bulls and right as she was being like, you know,

510
00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:44.440
you've kind of, he seems like he's fun.

511
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:48.340
All of a sudden he's upside down and then there's his fucking little fucking

512
00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:53.320
little a [inaudible], right? It's Jewish people say fucking flopping around.

513
00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:57.970
And it was just over that guy not only had to leave his hometown,

514
00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.860
his providence, he had to leave the country.

515
00:30:59.861 --> 00:31:02.710
He might've had to leave the continent. But now with fucking youtube, it's just,

516
00:31:02.711 --> 00:31:05.320
you know, and here I am talking about it, right.

517
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:09.130
Sex offenders have an easier time relocating them.

518
00:31:09.131 --> 00:31:12.660
That fucking guy after that one. So anyways, um,

519
00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.700
so I hear that sound and right as I turn around,

520
00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.750
I see the bull coming off the fence and I see this guy in loafers,

521
00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:25.030
you know, had run back away from the fence. Right.

522
00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:29.980
And what was funny was I went over there and I fed the fucking both and nothing

523
00:31:29.981 --> 00:31:34.450
happened. Came over there. I had a relaxed energy. I fucking, you know,

524
00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:37.750
I had my fucking weight on my back foot, you know,

525
00:31:37.751 --> 00:31:40.540
I was standing like a fucking boxer, you know, I wasn't standing there.

526
00:31:40.541 --> 00:31:43.150
Flatfooted like, look dope dude. When that fucking thing comes,

527
00:31:43.151 --> 00:31:44.170
I'm going to fall on my ass.

528
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:48.970
I was already anticipates like I am not ending up in a fucking youtube video.

529
00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:51.700
I'm already a white guy and we, I already,

530
00:31:51.970 --> 00:31:56.260
I am prone to walking up to animals like their dogs.

531
00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:59.290
I don't know why, why people do that. But I do that.

532
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.940
I see a lion at the zoo and I want to go up and give it a belly rub. All Yo,

533
00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:07.690
fuck it. Get rid of page. Right? Where other groups of people,

534
00:32:07.691 --> 00:32:09.240
for some reason they,

535
00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:12.190
they understand not even for some reason what they're doing is common sense.

536
00:32:12.191 --> 00:32:14.920
Whatever fucking reason. White people, we just want to go up and you know,

537
00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.110
I don't know. It's fucking stupid. Generally speaking, right? So,

538
00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:25.080
um, I'm like, what a fucking idiot. And you see the guy,

539
00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:26.040
he's got that look on his face,

540
00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.920
like he almost got hit in the face by a fucking bullhorn, right? And, uh,

541
00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:32.230
surprisingly the guides didn't say Shit, right?

542
00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:36.820
And then we're all going to get back on the little soft open thing,

543
00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:40.040
a safari truck. And I hear, boom, I hear it again in

544
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:43.100
<v 2>the same fight, look around again, same fucking guide,</v>

545
00:32:43.530 --> 00:32:44.750
backpedal and in a stupid loafers,

546
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.930
and they don't say a fucking word to this guy. So I'm just like,

547
00:32:47.931 --> 00:32:49.520
this guy is a fucking moron, right?

548
00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:53.780
So we get on the thing and I were driving over and now we're going to go see

549
00:32:53.781 --> 00:32:57.170
this giraffe, this teenage giraffe named Stanley.

550
00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:00.980
The coolest fucking giraffe you're ever gonna meet.

551
00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:05.210
It just was not afraid of people whatsoever, which of course is dangerous.

552
00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:09.320
The first thing I thought of when I fucking saw the Giraffe, it was like,

553
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:13.850
I remember seeing a giraffe on youtube kick a fucking lioness.

554
00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:18.800
This lion is went to jump on the things back in it, timed it perfectly.

555
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:24.500
Okay. Like Andre Agassi's fucking dead, dead fucking shot.

556
00:33:24.501 --> 00:33:25.370
He used to do right up.

557
00:33:25.371 --> 00:33:28.010
The fuck is not the baseline right up to fucking whatever.

558
00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:30.180
You still rip that back. Hey,

559
00:33:30.181 --> 00:33:32.960
now push right up and you know he always talks shit about it.

560
00:33:32.961 --> 00:33:37.130
Made a lot of money with that shot, right? That's what the fucking giraffe did.

561
00:33:37.131 --> 00:33:39.370
But what? That's leg kicked the Linus and what are they?

562
00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:43.820
How much does line way like 600 pounds, dude, he sent this fucking thing.

563
00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:48.650
It looked like it was doing like it was in the middle of doing a jumping jack

564
00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:49.753
and it was just,

565
00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:53.810
but it was just like doing this airborne cartwheel and it never came down in

566
00:33:53.811 --> 00:33:54.141
this thing.

567
00:33:54.141 --> 00:33:58.880
Fucking flipped around like three times and it hit the ground and it did not get

568
00:33:58.881 --> 00:34:01.640
up. All right. I know I use this reference a lot,

569
00:34:01.641 --> 00:34:03.860
but you remember the last hit Brett Farve took?

570
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:07.100
That's what this lioness looked like from a giraffe.

571
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:12.050
I couldn't believe it. Like I jumped up when I saw it, you know,

572
00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:16.010
it was like watching the nerd beat up the bully. All these guys were piling on.

573
00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:19.310
And what was funny when the other lions saw that they all like, oh shit,

574
00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:24.470
I didn't know why. I didn't know the giraffe could do that. Yeah,

575
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.180
it was like the Bruce Lee fucking,

576
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:29.510
was it the one inch punch when he'd send somebody flying across the room,

577
00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:31.100
we get it built. So that's,

578
00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:34.490
that's all I'm thinking is I am not getting anywhere near that thing's fucking

579
00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:37.850
likes of, of course they got like a 10 foot fence and then you walk up,

580
00:34:37.851 --> 00:34:41.270
the thing was 16 feet high as a teenager, right?

581
00:34:41.271 --> 00:34:43.580
And you go all the way up and all right,

582
00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:48.610
at that level it's just its head and you are feeding it little pieces of banana

583
00:34:49.011 --> 00:34:51.050
and all that shit with the skin.

584
00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:54.380
They just cut it up in sections and the way it would eat,

585
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:58.520
it looked like an old man that took its dentures out and it was adorable.

586
00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:03.890
And you know, the fucking pet the thing on its head, it was perfect, right?

587
00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:09.020
Brainwaves as what? Pulling up to go see this shit. The guide goes,

588
00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:13.310
all right, he goes, now look those camels over there. Egos.

589
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:17.300
You gotta be careful with those things. He goes, they're very aggressive.

590
00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:23.920
Um, you know, all they want is food, but if you don't have food, they're gonna.

591
00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:27.680
You got a great chance that they're going to bite you cause they're gonna get it

592
00:35:27.681 --> 00:35:28.520
one way or another.

593
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:33.050
It's just how they're wired and their necks are longer than you think.

594
00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:36.800
So don't be, you know, turn your back on.

595
00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:39.300
I'm to get a selfie cause you're gonna get bit.

596
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:44.150
And he goes in as much as I say this, you know, a couple, two,

597
00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:46.560
three people a month get bit right.

598
00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:51.420
So he says this all right. In Aloe,

599
00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:56.040
his thinking was good fellas, right? And after all there, yeah. Yeah.

600
00:35:56.070 --> 00:36:00.960
Bullshit. What does she do? She makes a fucking phone call from the home phone.

601
00:36:00.961 --> 00:36:02.970
Right? Exact same fucking thing.

602
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:07.950
There was these three women in front of us and for whatever fucking reason,

603
00:36:07.951 --> 00:36:10.770
like the second he gave that speech, I was like, you know what?

604
00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:14.190
Fuck those camels. I'm not going anywhere near him. I didn't try to feed him.

605
00:36:14.191 --> 00:36:17.310
I didn't do, I'm not fucking going to feed stuff. When the tour guy goes,

606
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.540
we're fucking three people get bit a month. I'm just like, you know what?

607
00:36:21.541 --> 00:36:23.100
Guess who's not going to be one of those three

608
00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:28.150
<v 0>Oh, freckles over here. All right, so we go have be pets, the giraffes.</v>

609
00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:31.900
We look at these fucking emails, which are the creepiest goddamn animal ever.

610
00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:36.340
I don't know. They do. They have a look on their fucking face. I can't even,

611
00:36:36.341 --> 00:36:41.310
I can't, I'm trying to describe the look. It's like,

612
00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:46.390
just imagine if like

613
00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:51.370
you are in your backyard and you would just drinking a glass of lemonade and all

614
00:36:51.371 --> 00:36:54.910
of a sudden you saw the ground moving in.

615
00:36:54.911 --> 00:36:57.220
A person just came up from under the ground.

616
00:36:57.790 --> 00:37:00.430
Just imagine how dirty their face would be.

617
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:04.930
And as they walk towards you to take a sip of lemonade, just imagine that,

618
00:37:04.931 --> 00:37:07.720
look on their face. That's what it looked like.

619
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:11.530
I went to feed one of those things and it fucking came walking over like a

620
00:37:11.531 --> 00:37:15.880
Zombie. Like I don't know what it was. And they got this thing where they don't,

621
00:37:15.881 --> 00:37:18.050
they can't like just gently take shit. They go,

622
00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:21.580
they do like fucking pit viper life. Like their fucking head comes right at you.

623
00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:26.050
I held this shit out and I, the second that thing locked eyes on me,

624
00:37:26.051 --> 00:37:28.190
I fucking just dropped the carrot and left, left.

625
00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:30.230
<v 2>It's like there, it's over. They're stupid.</v>

626
00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:34.340
And the thing was too dumb to fucking look down crazy.

627
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:38.970
It was like, it had like, I swear to God like that,

628
00:37:38.971 --> 00:37:42.020
that description they have when people are on the front lines in a fucking war,

629
00:37:42.021 --> 00:37:42.980
like world war one,

630
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:46.730
this thing look like had seen horror its entire fucking life.

631
00:37:46.731 --> 00:37:48.740
And it's just like, dude, you know how,

632
00:37:48.741 --> 00:37:51.080
but I just leave it here on the top of the fence and you figure it out.

633
00:37:51.081 --> 00:37:52.940
So anyways, so we'll walk them back to the, um,

634
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:57.320
to the little safari truck and those three fucking lay.

635
00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:02.660
Where are they at? Everybody. Where do you, where do you think that they're at?

636
00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:06.800
You think they getting on the truck? You know,

637
00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.040
you'd think they're ah,

638
00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.460
getting ready to go and enjoy a glass of fucking wine at the winery? No,

639
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:18.750
they're over by the fucking camels and they're fucking getting really close.

640
00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:20.540
But they got carrots so they're okay.

641
00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:25.310
But their way in this thing's fucking wheelhouse. Okay.

642
00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:30.140
And I'm just sitting there going like, and I literally Mulder to Nia.

643
00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:33.710
I go near filmless cause one of them is going to get bit,

644
00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:36.610
one of them is going to get bit right. So

645
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:42.280
<v 0>the cutest one of them. All right fucking what does she do</v>

646
00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.470
<v 2>after this guy says don't turn your back and try to take a selfie.</v>

647
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:50.820
What does this fucking woman do? She turns her fucking back.

648
00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:54.090
She's in this thing's fucking wheelhouse. She was so close to thing.

649
00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.070
It almost had the double back with its fucking

650
00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:56.953
<v 0>connect.</v>

651
00:38:57.130 --> 00:39:02.130
It was what it did if fucking once it realized it didn't have any more carrots,

652
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:04.070
it she didn't,

653
00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:09.110
it fucking doubled back and fucking basically bit this woman right on her boob,

654
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:10.221
her left boob.

655
00:39:10.221 --> 00:39:14.030
She had a jacket on and she just went like this and fucking stepped away.

656
00:39:14.031 --> 00:39:15.800
Fortunately, it didn't clamp down

657
00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:20.660
and it fucking, it had,

658
00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:23.830
she had these disgusting like just green soul,

659
00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:28.850
like grass stains and saliva cause the things fucking eat grass all day and she

660
00:39:29.541 --> 00:39:34.190
gets back to the thing and she's doing that whole, Oh my God,

661
00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:38.060
that thing just like bit me in the boob. Right. And the tour guide,

662
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:42.830
funniest thing ever. He just looks at it and he goes, oh I fucking told you.

663
00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:44.203
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

664
00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:46.620
<v 0>Hey dropped the f bomb.</v>

665
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:51.830
<v 2>Yeah. Fucking told you. It's my favorite thing that I think I've seen.</v>

666
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:55.880
I can't remember. That reminds me of when I was a kid,

667
00:39:56.120 --> 00:40:00.380
if I was part of the last generation, the last tail part of,

668
00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:04.700
if you slipped on the ice, it was your fucking fault. It wasn't the guy's fault

669
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:10.400
who had the storefront. It's like, yeah, Isis. Slippery. Stupid.

670
00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:14.180
Yeah. Maybe, maybe next time you'll fucking be a little more careful.

671
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:16.010
And then somehow it became,

672
00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:21.400
it became the shop owners fault that you fucking were walking to recklessly on

673
00:40:21.681 --> 00:40:25.370
ice. Like it's his ice. It's not his ice.

674
00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:30.590
It's made by the Lord. Right. That's like McDonald's having to make salads.

675
00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:34.880
They took fucking responsibility rather than, it's like, no,

676
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:38.600
it's your fault. You're fat. You ordered 50 fucking big Max. You can't,

677
00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:40.973
<v 0>you know,</v>

678
00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:43.770
<v 2>we're a business. If you order it, we're going to give it to you.</v>

679
00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.590
You're fucking dope. You know what?

680
00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:49.860
What do you want you to have to go eat a whole fucking gallon of ice cream?

681
00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:50.970
The fuck is wrong with you.

682
00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:54.990
And they somehow took the responsibility and they started making fucking salads.

683
00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:58.910
It's the stupidest thing I've ever seen in my life. So anyways, yeah. And that,

684
00:40:58.911 --> 00:41:01.110
that guy, he just way, you know, I fucking told,

685
00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:05.083
<v 1>okay</v>

686
00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.140
<v 0>dude, it was like needle off the record. I couldn't fucking believe it.</v>

687
00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:12.270
And they didn't say anything.

688
00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.360
<v 1>Okay.</v>

689
00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:14.930
<v 0>It was like,</v>

690
00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:18.230
it was like watching Donald Trump and that first debate when he was still funny

691
00:41:18.231 --> 00:41:20.090
before it was just like, holy fuck, this guy's,

692
00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:22.340
this guy might run the country now who's getting no,

693
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:26.120
he might speak for the company. He might pretend to be running the country.

694
00:41:26.121 --> 00:41:26.960
That's the real deal.

695
00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:30.230
That's why you can't be too afraid of Donald Trump because at the end of the

696
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:33.020
day, it's the, you know, come on, come on people. We all know.

697
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.540
<v 2>You know, I'll tell you right now, if I was fucking Isis,</v>

698
00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:42.530
those fucking dopes trying to sneak into this country and blow people up and

699
00:41:42.531 --> 00:41:43.130
shit.

700
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:48.130
All those fucking idiots gotta do is just get together their money and you just

701
00:41:48.891 --> 00:41:53.180
fucking put some money on Hillary, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Right.

702
00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:55.940
Okay. That's all you gotta do.

703
00:41:55.941 --> 00:42:00.941
And then you buy a little bit of advertising time on all the major networks and

704
00:42:01.191 --> 00:42:04.770
you'll never hear about them again. Yeah. That's how people,

705
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.320
that's how those fuckers, you know, genetically alter food.

706
00:42:07.321 --> 00:42:09.840
You never fucking hear about it cause they got their fucking money in

707
00:42:09.841 --> 00:42:12.210
everybody's pockets and everybody shuts the fuck up.

708
00:42:12.211 --> 00:42:13.350
So that's what Isis should do.

709
00:42:13.351 --> 00:42:17.080
They should just do that and then they could just walk into this country with

710
00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:21.320
the goddamn bazooka on their back and no one would say shit. Um,

711
00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:24.560
anyways, so yeah,

712
00:42:24.561 --> 00:42:27.020
that's what it was like the first debate with Donald Trump where he was just,

713
00:42:27.021 --> 00:42:29.660
they will, they say, you said this about women, you said that about women.

714
00:42:29.661 --> 00:42:32.570
He said, Nah, I said about, I said that about Rosie O'Donnell. And they're like,

715
00:42:32.571 --> 00:42:34.920
no, no. You said it about other women too. And he just goes, hey, you know,

716
00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:38.840
you're probably right. Yeah, you're probably right. That was, it was over.

717
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:43.560
<v 3>She's like, oh my God, I think Debbie, me, boom, fucking told you</v>

718
00:42:45.290 --> 00:42:50.120
<v 2>no sympathy, no fucking sympathy. It was perfect.</v>

719
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:54.710
It's exactly, it's exactly what I think most people need,

720
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:59.030
you know? Look, I'm not saying that you shouldn't have empathy.

721
00:42:59.031 --> 00:43:01.640
I'm not saying that you shouldn't have sympathy in that type of shit.

722
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:03.380
All I'm saying is there,

723
00:43:03.381 --> 00:43:08.381
there is a time and a place for no sympathy and that that was it.

724
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:13.160
That was, it was, it was done perfectly. You know,

725
00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:15.650
and I think she's going to be a better person because of it.

726
00:43:15.830 --> 00:43:18.740
She couldn't even argue is that God I fucking told you.

727
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:22.750
And when you really think about it, it's like when she comes back,

728
00:43:22.751 --> 00:43:24.560
I think bit me in the boob. It's like,

729
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:30.100
it's like I just fucking told you it was going to do that. Like,

730
00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:33.850
what do you think he's going to say? Oh, we did it. Oh, I'm sorry.

731
00:43:33.851 --> 00:43:37.960
Did it do exactly what the fuck I said it was going to do? Um,

732
00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.020
and then that was it. And then the next thing we did was we fucking,

733
00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:43.230
whenever we checked over all these original,

734
00:43:43.231 --> 00:43:45.960
like fucking airstreams and then we were drinking wine and like,

735
00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.440
that all happened. Like we got on the trail, like it bitter in the boob.

736
00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:51.150
He said, well, I fucking told you.

737
00:43:51.151 --> 00:43:53.970
And then we were drinking wine outside and I was just like, this might,

738
00:43:53.971 --> 00:43:58.660
this is fucking awesome. That should be part of the tour. That was,

739
00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:00.760
I dunno. Is it weird? Am I making a bigger deal about it?

740
00:44:00.761 --> 00:44:04.960
That it was so fucking refreshing? Yeah. Fuck head. You know,

741
00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:10.330
that's on you. All right,

742
00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:13.990
here we go. A Billy Belgium bill. Big Fan.

743
00:44:13.991 --> 00:44:18.950
Are you planning a trip to Belgium in the fucking future? Yeah. Um,

744
00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:23.380
can't wait to see you, uh, life on stage. Ah, you came close live.

745
00:44:23.381 --> 00:44:27.750
L I. V. E. And right now I'm still, I'm sticking with that French, by the way.

746
00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:30.720
I am a d on duo lingo. I got, yeah,

747
00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.130
23 days in a row. Michael Jordan,

748
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:38.120
23 fucking days in a row and a,

749
00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:42.920
I'm just going to keep fucking doing this shit. I try to get 200 points a day.

750
00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.880
Um, sometimes I don't buy, I get at least a hundred, although Tuesday I,

751
00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:50.570
it looks like I only got 10. I did one lesson. Are you? I am for the week.

752
00:44:50.571 --> 00:44:52.550
I got like one 60,

753
00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:57.050
then I got ten one 82 10,

754
00:44:57.051 --> 00:45:01.430
200, one 10 and two 30. That ain't bad.

755
00:45:02.570 --> 00:45:06.230
Um, he built, this isn't about you. It's about the fucking question.

756
00:45:06.231 --> 00:45:08.840
You're right. You're right. I get, I get distracted. I get distracted.

757
00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:12.710
Where the fuck am I? Uh, Jesus Christ.

758
00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:15.500
And there's another way I'm trying to learn French.

759
00:45:15.501 --> 00:45:20.501
I go to the Montreal Canadians website and I go under the French side and,

760
00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:25.480
uh, I know sacrilegious, but I fucking do it. And I, um,

761
00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:27.203
<v 1>okay.</v>

762
00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:28.740
<v 2>You know, what did I say? Uh,</v>

763
00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:34.960
something learning the hard way the last time. Like the pren days.

764
00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:36.783
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

765
00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:39.920
<v 2>Uh, something, deer or some the ire. I can kind of read it.</v>

766
00:45:39.921 --> 00:45:41.720
I still can't fucking speak it. I stink at it,

767
00:45:41.721 --> 00:45:45.230
but at least I'm getting to the point where I can kinda read, you know,

768
00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:46.760
at a decent level.

769
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:50.330
I've been going on youtube and I've been watching these fucking, you know, they,

770
00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:53.510
they like kids shows I sorta got, I'm going to get put on a list,

771
00:45:53.511 --> 00:45:56.810
but I'm learning. I'm learning. I'm fucking read it.

772
00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.200
Whether they're just going like the cat. They cat says me out, you know.

773
00:46:00.201 --> 00:46:04.940
Meow cat meow. Oh, look at that dog. Oh Hall. They do it all in front, right?

774
00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:11.060
Little Shit. Shit. It was all, um,

775
00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:15.320
all right, big fan. Are you planning a trip to Belgium in the future? Uh,

776
00:46:15.350 --> 00:46:20.240
can't wait to see you life alive on stage. Great Brain, great humor.

777
00:46:20.241 --> 00:46:20.840
Love your show.

778
00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:25.840
I am absolutely 100% going to get there at some point this year I am planning a

779
00:46:27.141 --> 00:46:31.700
tour of Eastern Europe and then my usual run through, uh,

780
00:46:31.850 --> 00:46:36.850
the widest people of all time from Finland all the way over to Iceland and a,

781
00:46:37.041 --> 00:46:41.090
I'm planning to end in Iceland and uh,

782
00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:47.620
spend an extra couple of days there at the blue lagoon spa and you got to do it

783
00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:52.860
and you should go during the winter when all the fucking tourists are not there.

784
00:46:53.370 --> 00:46:56.910
You want to be there when there's snow in the ground. I mean, right now,

785
00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.340
I don't know if the northern lights is still, we probably missed it by now,

786
00:46:59.341 --> 00:47:02.490
but like that's one that's like a bucket list thing for me. I want to go there,

787
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.410
see the fucking northern lights.

788
00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:09.030
When I went there I felt like I was on the top of the earth and it was the

789
00:47:09.031 --> 00:47:13.560
bluest place I'd ever been to in my life. Sky was so fucking blue.

790
00:47:13.561 --> 00:47:16.230
It was crazy. And um,

791
00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:20.390
tell me it's right there. Everybody always flies past it,

792
00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:24.880
but he goes right by it. Just fucking, you gotta go to it. Um,

793
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:26.720
I gotta tell you when to take a shower there. You got Yo,

794
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:30.400
you are going to taste fucking sulfur. Um, that's a little gross,

795
00:47:30.401 --> 00:47:34.780
but other than that, it's fantastic. Okay. So I will definitely be there.

796
00:47:34.781 --> 00:47:39.781
Hopefully by the end of the year are painting of Jesus laughing Dear Billy

797
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:42.970
Christ. My inlaws have had this,

798
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:47.620
Hank have had this hanging in their house since I've known them and I get a good

799
00:47:47.621 --> 00:47:50.200
chuckle every time I see it. Hope you do too, man.

800
00:47:50.201 --> 00:47:54.070
At least one artist is to picks the guy is a jolly man.

801
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:58.660
Now I got to go back because I copied and pasted, pasted it.

802
00:47:58.661 --> 00:48:01.690
Did it copied and pasted. Oh

803
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:08.570
yeah. It doesn't even look like Jesus. I got, oh a we got a,

804
00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:11.000
we got a tweet that a, that photo out.

805
00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:18.300
What made them laugh like that? Somebody was probably like, hey, you know, I uh,

806
00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:22.900
okay. Banged or a hooker like you a do I still have a chance to get to heaven

807
00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:30.190
laughing like that? You gonna be hanging out across like me. They have freckles.

808
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.990
Um, all right, I'll definitely, uh, I'll have to post it.

809
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:37.420
I'm sitting on my lower back again. How does this happen?

810
00:48:37.421 --> 00:48:42.310
I just slide down the fucking couch. Um, all right.

811
00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:46.670
Girlfriends, dysfunctional family. All right.

812
00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:49.990
A dear Billy boy. A huge fan of pockets. Thank you. Anyways,

813
00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:51.970
I am a male in his early twenties,

814
00:48:51.971 --> 00:48:54.730
living in a small one bedroom apartment with my girlfriend.

815
00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:59.260
Recently my girlfriend's mother has received a new job position that's much

816
00:48:59.261 --> 00:49:03.520
closer to us and she is currently in the process of looking for a new place in

817
00:49:03.521 --> 00:49:08.060
our area. Oh,

818
00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:09.600
GJ.

819
00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:14.360
I am all for my girlfriend being able to be closer to her family. Why?

820
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:18.800
Why would you be all for that? Be All for it if they're cool.

821
00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:20.301
I'm telling you right now,

822
00:49:20.301 --> 00:49:25.280
do not marry anybody who does not have a cool fucking family. Okay?

823
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:28.130
Cause those motherfuckers are going to be in your house.

824
00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:31.550
You think you're going to marry her and then Yay. All right.

825
00:49:31.551 --> 00:49:33.440
Take it easy at that. That, that, that,

826
00:49:33.441 --> 00:49:36.170
that that day he's going to fucking waltzer out the door for your wedding.

827
00:49:36.171 --> 00:49:39.590
Now they're going to be calling your house. They're going to be coming over.

828
00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:44.000
They're going to want to fucking play with your kids. Okay? Those people are,

829
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:46.520
you are marrying into the fucking family.

830
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:50.660
So right now I think what you're doing is you're trying to be a modern man,

831
00:49:50.661 --> 00:49:53.600
so you're just automatically going lay I, I'm all for it.

832
00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:56.850
I'm all for you expressing your opinions and, and,

833
00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:59.690
and your mother be right across the fucking street. Listen,

834
00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:04.630
I'm probably projecting here. Um, like I said, thank God,

835
00:50:04.631 --> 00:50:07.630
thank Christ. Um,

836
00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:12.790
the lovely Nia has a wonderful family. Um, thank God, thank Christ.

837
00:50:12.791 --> 00:50:15.040
Because I know people in that situation,

838
00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:20.170
in that situation like fucking misery,

839
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:24.520
the misery of the family. Like, you know,

840
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:28.940
they retire and then they just moved to where you are and then they just come

841
00:50:28.941 --> 00:50:33.710
over all the fucking time and they have no fucking clue how annoying they are.

842
00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:38.180
And then if the wife doesn't fucking say anything [inaudible] you got to step up

843
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:42.960
off dude. Fucking shit show. All right. Recently my girlfriends on Blah, blah,

844
00:50:42.961 --> 00:50:44.410
blah, blah, blah, blah. Uh,

845
00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:48.950
I'm all for my girlfriend being able to be closer to her family as I enjoy their

846
00:50:48.951 --> 00:50:52.640
company as well. Oh Shit. You know what? I didn't read that part. Sorry. Uh,

847
00:50:52.641 --> 00:50:56.930
but the whole moving situation is starting to become a bit of a headache and it

848
00:50:56.931 --> 00:51:00.020
starting to impede on our own lives. Yeah. See, you're young.

849
00:51:00.860 --> 00:51:03.530
You're in your early twenties. Okay. Here we go.

850
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:08.150
My girlfriend's mother is currently in between places and might stay with us

851
00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:12.110
during the week. However, this is not the worst of it.

852
00:51:12.111 --> 00:51:15.830
My girlfriend has three other siblings that her mother provides care for.

853
00:51:16.070 --> 00:51:17.570
Two brothers and one sister.

854
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:21.530
Her oldest brother in particular is a bit of a black sheep.

855
00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:26.570
He is easily agitated by the smallest requests like cleaning up after himself or

856
00:51:26.571 --> 00:51:28.070
remembering to lock the door.

857
00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:32.300
He is careless when it comes to using other people's belongings and does not

858
00:51:32.301 --> 00:51:35.510
clean up after himself. Well, you know what,

859
00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:38.990
that fuck that g can't stay there then I would,

860
00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:43.070
I would be a bit more forgiving if he was younger than I am,

861
00:51:43.071 --> 00:51:45.410
but he too was in his early twenties like me.

862
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:47.450
Now having to deal with the family member,

863
00:51:47.451 --> 00:51:49.740
like this may not sound like an issue. This

864
00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.210
dude is this, this is, this is making,

865
00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:55.860
I'm breaking out in hives reading this thing.

866
00:51:55.890 --> 00:51:58.410
This is how much of a fucking issue this is. Uh,

867
00:51:58.470 --> 00:52:03.470
especially if your girlfriend does not address what a dosha brother is,

868
00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:07.800
that's what you need. Okay? That's the keys to the castle, okay.

869
00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:12.630
If there's someone in, you know, whatever, if you're a woman dating a guy,

870
00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:14.430
right? If, if he has some, if,

871
00:52:14.431 --> 00:52:18.570
if his sister's a cunt and he won't address it on any level,

872
00:52:19.170 --> 00:52:21.450
I'm not saying he literally has to drop the fucking, you know,

873
00:52:22.380 --> 00:52:25.320
the scene up there, but you got,

874
00:52:25.321 --> 00:52:27.510
you got you gotta fucking and you gotta address it.

875
00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:28.813
<v 1>Okay.</v>

876
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:34.470
<v 2>Okay. He got a fucking addressing. All right. So anyways,</v>

877
00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:39.500
now having to deal with this bump up, um, deal with the member.

878
00:52:39.501 --> 00:52:41.150
Like, this may not sound like an issue today,

879
00:52:41.151 --> 00:52:43.850
but I learned that my girlfriend's mother asked to bring

880
00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:48.440
my girlfriend's brother with her to stay with us for a few days.

881
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:51.380
Let's face it will probably be longer than that.

882
00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:55.340
After seeing firsthand how he acts with other people, especially his family,

883
00:52:55.341 --> 00:52:57.170
I want to say no and be done with it,

884
00:52:57.470 --> 00:53:00.680
but I'm sure this will open up more issues between myself and my girlfriend,

885
00:53:00.681 --> 00:53:04.090
her mother, and possibly her brother. Yeah, it'll bring up great issues.

886
00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:08.070
The fact that her brother's a fucking selfish dude.

887
00:53:08.071 --> 00:53:12.060
You are right now in the beginning of creating your adult life.

888
00:53:12.510 --> 00:53:16.770
So when you feel no, you say no. All right,

889
00:53:16.860 --> 00:53:21.330
and if your girlfriend gets fucking pissed, then fuck her. Okay.

890
00:53:21.331 --> 00:53:24.660
If she wants to break up with you, you know what you did, dude, you just,

891
00:53:24.820 --> 00:53:29.220
you just away from what you know, what you did. You fell. You fast forward,

892
00:53:30.210 --> 00:53:34.200
you're fast forwarding through the fucking nightmare and you're getting to the

893
00:53:34.201 --> 00:53:38.070
inevitable end of the fucking relationship without you being legally bonded to

894
00:53:38.071 --> 00:53:38.520
them,

895
00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:42.540
without you having kids that have fucking look like her and just remind you of

896
00:53:42.541 --> 00:53:45.270
them every fucking time it mind you or her. Every time you see him,

897
00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:49.140
this is what you have to do. You have to listen to your gut in life,

898
00:53:49.170 --> 00:53:52.170
your gut will tell you, you saying, I don't want to do this.

899
00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:55.830
But then what happens is social politeness kicks him. Ah, you know,

900
00:53:55.831 --> 00:53:58.710
it's only for a few days, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I don't know.

901
00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:02.700
Fuck all of that. Fuck all of that.

902
00:54:02.730 --> 00:54:05.250
I'm not saying that you have to say it the way I'm saying it,

903
00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.560
but you have to have a sit down and just be like, listen,

904
00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:09.870
I don't mind if your mother stay here,

905
00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:11.520
but I'm not comfortable with your brothers staying here.

906
00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:14.730
If she says why it's my brother and be like,

907
00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:18.720
because he's inconsiderate and he's reckless with a personal belongings.

908
00:54:18.721 --> 00:54:20.930
He forgets to lock the door and all that. And um,

909
00:54:20.970 --> 00:54:25.050
I don't think he's a responsible person and just let it sit there.

910
00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:27.930
And if she has a fucking problem with it, who gives a fuck? I don't,

911
00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:31.200
you don't have to be disrespectful. Just be like, I don't share the,

912
00:54:31.201 --> 00:54:33.720
your viewpoint. And I live here too. And I'm saying, I'm saying no,

913
00:54:33.721 --> 00:54:37.320
he can't stay here. And then she'll have nothing to say other than,

914
00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:39.000
so you saying you can't stay here.

915
00:54:39.001 --> 00:54:40.740
She'll just start repeating what you're saying and be like,

916
00:54:40.741 --> 00:54:41.640
that is what I'm saying.

917
00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:46.200
And then you let her huff and you let her puff and do all the fucking shit she's

918
00:54:46.201 --> 00:54:50.080
going to do and you don't let that fucking Douche step into the house. And look,

919
00:54:50.130 --> 00:54:53.160
here's the thing, dude, what do you, what do you have to lose here

920
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:58.250
other than your own happiness? You've got to put a value on it. Anyways,

921
00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:01.620
let me just continue on here. Um,

922
00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:06.300
he says after seeing firsthand how he acts with other people,

923
00:55:06.301 --> 00:55:08.340
especially his family. I want to say no,

924
00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:11.610
but I'm sure there's open up more issues between myself, my girlfriend,

925
00:55:11.611 --> 00:55:11.941
her mother,

926
00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:16.350
and possibly her brother as it is an issue with my girlfriend and I have argued

927
00:55:16.351 --> 00:55:19.620
about it in the past. Oh yes. You've already done it yet, Dude. All right.

928
00:55:19.621 --> 00:55:22.320
You're already knocked down the, you already kicked in the door. Walk in.

929
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:26.430
What would you do in this situation? I think I've already said it. Uh,

930
00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:29.670
and is there any sort of advice you can give me if her brother does come to stay

931
00:55:29.671 --> 00:55:30.301
for a few days,

932
00:55:30.301 --> 00:55:34.500
how should I treat him knowing he probably just get agitated with me telling him

933
00:55:34.770 --> 00:55:37.920
to clean up after himself. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself dude. This is the deal,

934
00:55:37.921 --> 00:55:40.500
dude. This isn't, this is non negotiable.

935
00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:45.270
This is non fucking negotiable.

936
00:55:46.350 --> 00:55:50.040
Okay? This is your life. All right?

937
00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:55.020
And he's a fucking Dosha. And isn't it?

938
00:55:55.021 --> 00:55:58.770
If your girlfriend can't see what a fucking asshole this guy is due,

939
00:55:58.771 --> 00:56:03.540
can you imagine if your brother was like this and it made your girlfriend feel

940
00:56:03.541 --> 00:56:07.140
uncomfortable? Would your brother be eight staying with you?

941
00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:10.770
He makes me uncomfortable. I know. He's weird. He doesn't pick up.

942
00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:14.730
He smells my me undies. Whatever the fuck he's doing. You'd be like, oh,

943
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:19.480
that's it. You can't, you can't be here. You know,

944
00:56:19.790 --> 00:56:24.450
and when it won't cause you're a jerk off. Alright,

945
00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:28.060
there's a super right down the street. Good luck to Ya. You know,

946
00:56:31.170 --> 00:56:32.003
<v 1>um,</v>

947
00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:34.780
<v 0>I got to tell you this, this, this might be</v>

948
00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:36.770
<v 1>okay.</v>

949
00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:41.360
<v 0>This might be the old right there, Fred, for your fucking relationship, okay?</v>

950
00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:42.820
<v 1>Okay.</v>

951
00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:44.350
<v 0>You might have to throw down the gauntlet.</v>

952
00:56:45.690 --> 00:56:46.060
<v 1>Okay.</v>

953
00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:49.570
<v 0>All right. I got to tell you, dude, if, if this, if this fucking asshole</v>

954
00:56:51.250 --> 00:56:53.320
is already making you this fucking miserable,

955
00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:59.980
okay? Just the idea of him staying with you for a couple, two, three days.

956
00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.830
All right? Are you really gonna marry this woman?

957
00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:08.330
You're gonna marry into that with that fucking shit show and they'll buy it on

958
00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:10.490
there. You hear me, man name. Very fucking see him.

959
00:57:10.491 --> 00:57:13.730
Fuck that until he goes out and he fucks his whole fucking life up.

960
00:57:13.731 --> 00:57:16.490
But you know, and what happens you do you, I'm assuming you,

961
00:57:16.491 --> 00:57:18.590
you're planning on being successful in life, right?

962
00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:22.140
Which means you're going to go make a big bag Aleut and get yourself a whip.

963
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:24.580
<v 2>Alright, sorry. Um,</v>

964
00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:28.340
<v 0>no, you can have a nice car. You have a nice house, you know, a beautiful wife.</v>

965
00:57:28.341 --> 00:57:29.720
You can have all that type of shit and you know what?

966
00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.900
You know what comes to con's. Think like, well how come I don't have that?

967
00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:34.250
It's like, well, cause you didn't work for,

968
00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:36.260
it's stupid and they're not gonna think that and they,

969
00:57:36.261 --> 00:57:39.500
they're going to want to come around and they're gonna want fucking handouts and

970
00:57:39.501 --> 00:57:43.370
if she, and if, if that fucking jerk-off knows that his sister is a big softy,

971
00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:47.270
she's gonna use her to get to you and all this shit that you fucking work for.

972
00:57:47.610 --> 00:57:52.520
Okay. I'm, I'm painting a very bleak scenario here, but um, dude, you just,

973
00:57:52.521 --> 00:57:54.260
you say no, he can't stay here.

974
00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.470
<v 2>You know, and if it really comes down to just listen, I don't like the guy.</v>

975
00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:04.630
Okay. And I don't think it's,

976
00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:07.600
I just think it's how he's wired because you turned out great.

977
00:58:08.290 --> 00:58:10.210
You guys both had the same fucking parents.

978
00:58:10.211 --> 00:58:12.640
I don't know what happened to that guy, but he's a fucking,

979
00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:16.570
I don't say fucking that guy. He's just like, I don't want him in my,

980
00:58:16.571 --> 00:58:18.640
I don't want him here. You mother can stay plus that.

981
00:58:18.641 --> 00:58:20.830
It's only a one bedroom apartment, you know,

982
00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:24.580
so we're going to be on top of each other and I can't deal with that guy when

983
00:58:24.581 --> 00:58:28.030
I'm at your mother's house. Forget about in our one bedroom apartment.

984
00:58:28.031 --> 00:58:31.220
I don't want that guy here. I don't want his balls dangle

985
00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:34.940
<v 0>linen, our fucking commode. I don't want his pubes in my shower.</v>

986
00:58:34.941 --> 00:58:37.760
I don't want his hands in my f on the fridge. I just don't want them here.

987
00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:38.603
I don't want him here.

988
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:42.800
<v 2>You know what's funny? I don't even know this guy and I fucking hate him.</v>

989
00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:46.730
There's no fucking way, dude,

990
00:58:48.290 --> 00:58:51.380
please can you please do this for yourself.

991
00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:55.460
And this is a great exercise to have, you know,

992
00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:57.860
for both men and women. You can flip this around,

993
00:58:57.861 --> 00:59:01.520
like learning how to stand up to the person that you're with.

994
00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:04.400
You got to learn how to do that and you just, sometimes you just have to,

995
00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:07.580
you got to have a fight. You just have to have a fight. And um,

996
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:12.810
and there is a freedom to not giving a fuck in a good way.

997
00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:15.890
What people think about you. I mean, do you,

998
00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:20.280
who gives a fuck if some piece of shit selfish shit doesn't like you.

999
00:59:20.281 --> 00:59:24.290
What the fuck do you I, I'm a I, Jeez.

1000
00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:28.850
I would just openly, I don't like you. Yes. You,

1001
00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:31.400
I don't like you. I think you're a piece of garbage.

1002
00:59:33.090 --> 00:59:35.910
And then we looked at his girlfriend. He looks at your girlfriend or his sister.

1003
00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:37.560
You just fed. Yeah. Don't worry. I already told her,

1004
00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:43.753
<v 1>Oh</v>

1005
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720
<v 2>sir,</v>

1006
00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:47.950
please don't let him stay in your place and please write right in and please

1007
00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:50.080
tell me. Please tell me what happened.

1008
00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:51.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1009
00:59:51.330 --> 00:59:56.090
<v 2>I don't know why, but I live for moments like this in life. You know,</v>

1010
00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:59.900
as much as I like making people laugh and that type of thing,

1011
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:03.890
I get even more enjoyment telling pieces of shit.

1012
01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:05.713
No.

1013
01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:09.710
It's one of the great things and just the look on their fucking face because the

1014
01:00:09.711 --> 01:00:14.330
reason why a lot of pieces of shit are pieces of shit because people politely

1015
01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.440
maneuver around them.

1016
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:16.513
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1017
01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.710
<v 2>And when you can get that fucking Mitt right in their face, you know,</v>

1018
01:00:19.711 --> 01:00:21.900
put your hand right in their forehead, that it's about far enough.

1019
01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:26.100
There's sparky. Ah, it's just, it's one of the great feelings in life.

1020
01:00:26.101 --> 01:00:29.610
I think that's why God made douchebags just so you know,

1021
01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.360
someone like yourself can have that feeling.

1022
01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:35.293
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1023
01:00:35.620 --> 01:00:37.200
<v 2>I'm really coming off arrogant here for, you know,</v>

1024
01:00:37.201 --> 01:00:40.300
I'm probably the douchebag too anyways. All right. Fiance's wedding plans.

1025
01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:44.650
Eddie had Billy blue band, blue bland. The fuck is that? Um,

1026
01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:50.560
first let me say, I can't see, I can't wait to see you in Orlando on May 7th.

1027
01:00:50.620 --> 01:00:53.620
I don't know why I haven't seen you perform live yet, but you are my,

1028
01:00:54.070 --> 01:00:57.640
you are the last on my top 10 comedians to see before I die. Oh Jesus.

1029
01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:01.750
There's way more that you should see than that, but I am,

1030
01:01:01.751 --> 01:01:05.530
I'm very flattered that I am one of the 10. Okay. So he says,

1031
01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.710
I've been engaged for three years now. Alright, dumper.

1032
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:12.520
You don't want to marry her. Do I really need to read the rest of this?

1033
01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.120
The fuck is engaged for three years,

1034
01:01:18.350 --> 01:01:18.681
you said,

1035
01:01:18.681 --> 01:01:23.260
and me and my lady are in the first steps of finally planning our wedding. I am.

1036
01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.500
I am simple and,

1037
01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:29.150
and am okay with something small and would rather save money for our honeymoon

1038
01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:31.100
and down payment on the house. And let me guess.

1039
01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.990
She wants to spend a ton of fucking money.

1040
01:01:34.070 --> 01:01:37.550
My fiance wants a destination theme wedding.

1041
01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:42.110
I'm not opposed to compromise and have a destination wedding,

1042
01:01:42.111 --> 01:01:45.710
but she wants the theme to be the Little Mermaid in Hawaii.

1043
01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:50.930
She's adamant about this and has these horrible outfits picked out for the whole

1044
01:01:50.931 --> 01:01:55.730
wedding party to wear, including myself as Neptune. I don't believe this.

1045
01:01:57.660 --> 01:02:02.150
I'm calling bullshit, but you know what?

1046
01:02:02.151 --> 01:02:06.800
As always I'll read it like it's true. Um, I'm 37 and she is 28 if that matters.

1047
01:02:06.801 --> 01:02:08.000
I sincerely love her,

1048
01:02:08.001 --> 01:02:12.110
but she won't let this go and I absolutely refuse to go through with that.

1049
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:14.360
I don't want to lose her in my life,

1050
01:02:14.361 --> 01:02:18.830
but I've tried everything I can think of to talk her out of it and honestly it's

1051
01:02:18.831 --> 01:02:22.680
a deal breaker for me. Please tell me your thoughts and if you have any advice,

1052
01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:25.110
I'd be very grateful. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. All right,

1053
01:02:25.111 --> 01:02:29.790
well this isn't a joke question. You've been engaged for three fucking years.

1054
01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:35.010
Okay, that's weird. I think there's something going on there and a, you know,

1055
01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:35.700
your,

1056
01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:38.310
your a little bit country's is a little bit rock and roll forever that they all

1057
01:02:38.311 --> 01:02:43.260
fucking Donny and Marie show usually sometimes opposites, you know, you know,

1058
01:02:43.290 --> 01:02:46.890
she's that party you, she completes you. I don't, I don't think she's,

1059
01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:49.280
<v 1>yeah,</v>

1060
01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:52.270
<v 2>this is a shit show. If this is true, you are, you're</v>

1061
01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:54.153
<v 1>okay.</v>

1062
01:02:54.850 --> 01:02:58.600
<v 2>Do you understand that when you inevitably get divorced from this fucking woman</v>

1063
01:02:58.601 --> 01:03:03.560
that you are going to get no sympathy from anybody? They will first be that,

1064
01:03:03.570 --> 01:03:06.360
oh my God, a divorce. I heard, you know, other than losing a loved one,

1065
01:03:06.361 --> 01:03:07.680
that's the most stressful thing ever.

1066
01:03:07.681 --> 01:03:12.150
But when you tell the story that you dressed like Neptune at your own fucking

1067
01:03:12.151 --> 01:03:14.850
wedding, right? Then average girl, yeah. Have, you know I fucking told you.

1068
01:03:14.851 --> 01:03:18.900
She goes, yeah dude.

1069
01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:23.160
And you walk away from it. You're 37 you find you'll meet somebody else. Okay?

1070
01:03:23.161 --> 01:03:25.230
You get on it, you run a biological clock.

1071
01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:27.330
This one of the great things about being a dude, you know,

1072
01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:30.880
but it all balances out because we die eight years before them, you know,

1073
01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:32.550
so they get the little, little bit, you know,

1074
01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:35.820
live a little bit longer sitting in that coffee house, you know,

1075
01:03:35.970 --> 01:03:39.950
eating those fucking weird chocolates. Um, said,

1076
01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:44.100
oh, this is somebody else's. I'm sorry. I thought that's how he signed off. Um,

1077
01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:47.280
yeah, I would walk away from this whole fucking thing.

1078
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:51.480
How many more red flags need to be shook in your face?

1079
01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:56.010
You just walk away from the whole fucking thing.

1080
01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:59.930
Fuck you. Oh my God, Dude.

1081
01:03:59.931 --> 01:04:02.540
What kind of fucking issues does she have that she wants to have on the,

1082
01:04:02.650 --> 01:04:03.810
he's a little, oh my God.

1083
01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:08.400
She one of those women that has that Google Gaga creepy ass fucking voice.

1084
01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:13.150
She talks like she's fucking six. Oh God.

1085
01:04:13.151 --> 01:04:17.350
That gives you the fucking chills. Can you be a fucking adult over here?

1086
01:04:17.850 --> 01:04:18.683
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1087
01:04:19.030 --> 01:04:20.080
<v 2>What do you, what do we do? You mean what,</v>

1088
01:04:20.081 --> 01:04:22.990
what if you wanted a Scooby doo theme? Fucking wedding, right?

1089
01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:28.000
You wanted her to dress like fucking that with the Janine Gruffalo red headed

1090
01:04:28.361 --> 01:04:29.194
one, you know,

1091
01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:33.830
and her sister to dress like Daphne and you were going to be fucking shaggy and

1092
01:04:33.831 --> 01:04:36.970
the best man was going to dress like Fred with that scarf around his fuck it.

1093
01:04:36.971 --> 01:04:41.530
Why don't we, why wait, do I don't believe that question? I just don't.

1094
01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:45.250
Okay. And if you fucking marry her, you deserve it.

1095
01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:48.460
You know? And when you come crying up to me,

1096
01:04:48.461 --> 01:04:52.900
I'm going to steal from that fucking Tori. I fucking told you. All right.

1097
01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:58.090
Squatch hey Billy. Birdlegs that's fucking hilarious.

1098
01:04:59.230 --> 01:05:02.800
I've been listening to you talk about the way you work out in the podcast and I

1099
01:05:03.070 --> 01:05:06.490
gotta chime in, do some fucking squats.

1100
01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:09.520
Do road squats are not a leg exercise.

1101
01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:14.190
There are compound full body movement. Ugh, this is already making me tired. Uh,

1102
01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:16.630
put a couple of hundred pounds on your back.

1103
01:05:16.631 --> 01:05:21.631
Just your legs and watch while your frail freckled spine gets twisted like a

1104
01:05:21.971 --> 01:05:25.780
pretzel. Well, why would I want to do that? Squats and deadlifts,

1105
01:05:25.870 --> 01:05:29.020
which I recommend to a

1106
01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:33.730
need you to engage damn near every muscle in your body.

1107
01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.580
If you want to put on some real muscle density,

1108
01:05:36.610 --> 01:05:41.230
stop being such a cowardly little cat and learn to squat and dead lift. Dude,

1109
01:05:41.231 --> 01:05:45.070
I don't want to walk around all bulked up, you know,

1110
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.780
start wearing tank tops. I'm not trying to do that. Jesus Christ. He said,

1111
01:05:49.781 --> 01:05:52.600
I recommend watching Ed Coa,

1112
01:05:52.660 --> 01:05:56.710
n Apostrophe [inaudible] squat and dead live videos from super training on

1113
01:05:56.711 --> 01:05:59.960
youtube to start. Dude, I'm not trying to get into the NFL. Uh,

1114
01:06:00.370 --> 01:06:03.430
then watch the rest of their content and learn what the fuck you're doing.

1115
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:08.320
I wrote some stuff about my experience with adding squats and deadlifts to my

1116
01:06:08.321 --> 01:06:11.440
routine. You can read it or not. Just lift some heavy shit.

1117
01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:14.380
Stop being a bitch and go fuck yourself. All right.

1118
01:06:14.410 --> 01:06:17.560
I like the way this man speaks. He gets right to it. He's very direct.

1119
01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:22.210
My experience when I was younger, I used to, I used to be a mirror muscles,

1120
01:06:22.660 --> 01:06:27.010
guys, mirror muscle guy too. Fuck you talking about, dude, I got a pegboard.

1121
01:06:27.011 --> 01:06:30.910
I got those Tomic fucking I'm doing all I'm doing.

1122
01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:33.910
I'm trying to do like half. Um,

1123
01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:37.360
what are the American Ninja Warrior fucking thing?

1124
01:06:37.361 --> 01:06:41.590
I'm building that in my garage. All right. You with your fucking

1125
01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:42.890
<v 4>yeah.</v>

1126
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:47.300
<v 2>Schwartzenegger workout from 1978 stop acting like you're in the future.</v>

1127
01:06:47.450 --> 01:06:50.090
You fucking cunt. I was decent. You know, you came in,

1128
01:06:50.091 --> 01:06:51.350
you were talking a little bit fresh.

1129
01:06:51.351 --> 01:06:54.380
You need to fucking stand down a little bit here. Um,

1130
01:06:54.570 --> 01:06:58.340
is then I got older and I started working in a chocolate factory. You know,

1131
01:06:58.341 --> 01:06:59.510
everything seems like a lie.

1132
01:06:59.511 --> 01:07:02.750
This you worked in a cha where you in a fucking tree making cookies.

1133
01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:08.000
Amazingly doing car curls and benching one 35 or to spending the day sitting at

1134
01:07:08.001 --> 01:07:09.590
my desk shoveling free chocolate.

1135
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:13.250
And my face did nothing to stop my belly from growing. Well, yeah, well neither.

1136
01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:16.430
We're doing squats. Okay.

1137
01:07:16.431 --> 01:07:21.050
If you don't fucking eat anything else but cookies. Anyways, he goes,

1138
01:07:21.051 --> 01:07:25.070
now I squat bench and deadlift like a power lifter and I am stronger and more

1139
01:07:25.071 --> 01:07:29.460
Jack than I have ever bent yet. And you stop eating chocolate. Uh,

1140
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:34.130
not only do I actually have legs now, but my chest arms and back traps,

1141
01:07:34.131 --> 01:07:36.080
everything are bigger than ever. I just,

1142
01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:38.930
I can't recommend the videos from super trading enough. All right,

1143
01:07:38.931 --> 01:07:41.780
I'll check it out. The guys are hilarious. Strong as fuck in there.

1144
01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:44.750
There is tons of great info on there. Anyways, they appreciate the podcast.

1145
01:07:44.751 --> 01:07:47.990
Best of luck with the new home gym and again, go fuck yourself. All right, cool.

1146
01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:51.410
I will definitely check that out. Thank you so much for that information.

1147
01:07:51.411 --> 01:07:53.000
Once again for people at Home Ed,

1148
01:07:53.570 --> 01:07:58.570
it said Coa and apostrophe s for some reason I don't that looks like it's

1149
01:07:59.961 --> 01:08:04.430
missing something. But anyways, it's called a super training.

1150
01:08:04.910 --> 01:08:07.610
So if you spell the name kind of like that, it ought to come up in your, uh,

1151
01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:12.530
your Google search there. Okay. About driving in, diving into caves.

1152
01:08:14.060 --> 01:08:16.940
Uh, hey bill, you were talking divers with those caves.

1153
01:08:16.941 --> 01:08:21.200
Here's a documentary of Finnish guys who legally illegally,

1154
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:25.370
who go illegally to their dead friends bodies.

1155
01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:31.720
What from their last trip?

1156
01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:36.160
I think it was made illegal to go there after they die because it was too

1157
01:08:36.161 --> 01:08:41.050
dangerous to go to those ks. But they went anyway and made a movie about it.

1158
01:08:41.051 --> 01:08:43.900
Come to Finland soon and go fuck yourself. Well,

1159
01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:47.740
why don't they retrieve the bodies? Is everybody lying to me this week?

1160
01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:50.590
Why can't you be honest? Alright, the last one here,

1161
01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:55.150
a girlfriend is good friends with dudes. She met on Tinder.

1162
01:08:58.090 --> 01:09:01.660
Uh, hey, Billy red Burke, uh, Bork, kind of,

1163
01:09:01.661 --> 01:09:04.300
I guess it's supposed to be like Ray Borg, red book. Um,

1164
01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:08.560
so recently I was talking with my girlfriend about one of her guy friends.

1165
01:09:09.130 --> 01:09:12.100
The two of them seemed pretty close.

1166
01:09:12.130 --> 01:09:14.740
He did a photo shoot for a t shirt company.

1167
01:09:15.190 --> 01:09:19.720
She starting in and she even said, we're like the same person.

1168
01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:24.820
Yeah, dude, it's sour. It's over. She hasn't blown him yet.

1169
01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:29.050
She's gonna walk away something. She has said something.

1170
01:09:29.051 --> 01:09:31.600
She has said to me as we're talking,

1171
01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:36.660
she reveals that she met this dude off of the dating and actually just about

1172
01:09:37.241 --> 01:09:40.780
fucking app Tinder before too.

1173
01:09:41.050 --> 01:09:43.900
You wrote this so bad before she, we got together.

1174
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:47.290
I'm just going to read it how you wrote it. I tried to play cool letter,

1175
01:09:47.291 --> 01:09:50.250
talk about him and just brush it off as whatever, dude,

1176
01:09:50.251 --> 01:09:54.160
this is the brainwashing of the American male now where everything is,

1177
01:09:54.161 --> 01:09:57.460
if you even question a woman, it's like, wait, was that date rape?

1178
01:09:58.700 --> 01:10:02.950
So you just ignore all your fucking instincts here. I tried to play it. Cool.

1179
01:10:03.070 --> 01:10:06.730
Yeah, her douchebag brother who does totally inconsiderate, wants to stay here.

1180
01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:11.590
You know I'm all for that. You're not all for that. Your soul is screaming.

1181
01:10:11.591 --> 01:10:15.810
No, you're playing it cool cause you're not cool with it.

1182
01:10:17.010 --> 01:10:17.161
Yeah.

1183
01:10:17.161 --> 01:10:20.670
Why don't you go hang out with some fuck buddy you met on Tinder and see how she

1184
01:10:20.671 --> 01:10:21.960
fucking likes it. Right. Anyways,

1185
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:26.160
well the two of them text quite a lot and the other night she received something

1186
01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:28.290
I think from him and she laughed.

1187
01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:33.360
Now I am ordinarily not a nosy type, but the situation is weird.

1188
01:10:33.361 --> 01:10:36.630
So I asked what's funny, she flipped. She said,

1189
01:10:36.631 --> 01:10:39.870
I'm being too nosy and trying to pry into her personal life. Oh my God.

1190
01:10:39.871 --> 01:10:42.810
And then did you give her a sidekick? Right out of the fucking bed.

1191
01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:47.240
He goes, I mean, she really flipped a shit about it.

1192
01:10:47.241 --> 01:10:50.100
She claims I'm being paranoid and that they are just friends.

1193
01:10:51.810 --> 01:10:55.170
I Dunno Billy. If they've fucked, what's to say they wanted to,

1194
01:10:55.410 --> 01:10:59.610
what do you mean you don't know? He finishes it with them. I being paranoid.

1195
01:10:59.710 --> 01:11:04.440
Should I not give a shit or should I kick this check to the curb dude.

1196
01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:08.520
Punter to the curb. Right in the seat of her fucking lion pants.

1197
01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:11.640
Yeah. Yeah.

1198
01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:15.360
<v 0>And I would just say, why are you breaking up? I go,</v>

1199
01:11:15.361 --> 01:11:19.860
cause you cause the guy on Tinder completes you. Go get with him.

1200
01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.680
Oh my God. You're being paranoid. No, I'm not.

1201
01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:25.920
You guys are fucking in my heart to heart. You guys are fucking,

1202
01:11:25.921 --> 01:11:29.610
and if you're not, you're Gunna, and to be honest with you,

1203
01:11:29.611 --> 01:11:30.810
you probably should be.

1204
01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:35.160
You're fucking laying in bed with me giggling about his God damn texts.

1205
01:11:35.190 --> 01:11:39.600
Just go over there and suck his dick already. They give me my keys

1206
01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:44.790
that said it's fucking over. All right, that's the podcast for this week.

1207
01:11:44.791 --> 01:11:46.620
Go fuck yourselves. I'll talk to you Thursday.
