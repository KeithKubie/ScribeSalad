KEVIN VALK: Hello everyone.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.810
Welcome the Talks at Google.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.520
I'm Kevin Valk.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.446
And today we're welcoming
Miss Jane Lynch--

00:00:10.446 --> 00:00:12.326
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:12.326 --> 00:00:13.242
JANE LYNCH: Thank you.

00:00:13.242 --> 00:00:14.733
KEVIN VALK: And Kate Flannery.

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:16.625
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:19.510
KEVIN VALK: So
you best know them

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.175
as Sue Sylvester from "Glee"
and Meredith from "The Office".

00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:23.800
But right now they're
teaming together.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.450
And they're doing a big
old tour for "See Jane

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.590
Sing" around the country.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.150
They're going to be playing
up at UC Davis tomorrow night.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.240
And then they have a big
line of shows the 16th

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.020
through the 19th of August this
month up at Joe's Pub in New

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.540
York City.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.206
JANE LYNCH: Mhm.

00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:38.420
KEVIN VALK: So awesome.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.630
So tell me about the shop.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.250
JANE LYNCH: Well, it started
out as, 54 Below, which

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.250
is a cabaret space
in New York, asked me

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.834
if I would like four nights to
do my act, assuming I had one.

00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:48.250
I said, well, I
don't have an act.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.330
But I will put one together.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.860
So I challenged myself.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.330
And I brought this one
on board immediately.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.690
We've been singing together for
probably decades which is kind

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.150
of a shocking thing to hear.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.840
And you know, I just started
putting songs together.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.550
And we ended up with
about a 45-minute show.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.480
And we had so much fun.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.020
And we had a three-piece band.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.050
And so that's how I met who is
now my manager, Steven Greener.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.920
And that's now Deana's
my tour manager.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.970
And everything just
started falling together.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.910
And we have a five-piece band
, the Tony Guerrero quintet.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.630
And they are frigging
amazing you guys.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.540
They are masters.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.210
And then this other
dude, Tim Davis,

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.217
who was the vocal
arranger on "Glee",

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:33.300
became a very good friend.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.280
And he joins us.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.500
And we do these really
tight three-part harmonies.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.554
And wow, we're having a blast.

00:01:38.554 --> 00:01:39.220
KEVIN VALK: Wow.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.860
So what's your favorite part
of the show in terms of--

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.861
is it the live audience?

00:01:41.861 --> 00:01:43.609
JANE LYNCH: The live
audience and anything

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:44.415
I do with this one.

00:01:44.415 --> 00:01:44.710
KATE FLANNERY: Hey.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.310
I was going to say
the same thing.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.200
KEVIN VALK: But you
guys know each other

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.550
from a long time ago.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.020
Because you grew up in Chicago.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.330
JANE LYNCH: Uh-huh.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.930
KEVIN VALK: Outside of Chicago.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.190
You grew up on the east coast.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.090
But you guys were--

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.380
JANE LYNCH: Came together
at the Annoyance in Chicago.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.680
KATE FLANNERY: In Chicago,
the Annoyance Theatre.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.920
Yeah.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.860
JANE LYNCH: And you were at
Second City but after me.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.660
KATE FLANNERY: After you, yes.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.950
KEVIN VALK: Right.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.570
KATE FLANNERY: But I was
Jane's understudy in the show

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:00.290
"The Real Live Brady Bunch".

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.580
JANE LYNCH: Yes.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.780
KATE FLANNERY: But I played
all the non-Brady roles.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.910
So we got to play together.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.150
But then I got to watch her.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.670
And so it was like a
weird science project.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.503
JANE LYNCH: And you
were great as Alice too.

00:02:06.503 --> 00:02:07.250
You did Alice.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.209
KATE FLANNERY: I did Alice
for quite awhile, yeah.

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.859
JANE LYNCH: She was hilarious.

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:12.210
And we all came out
here at the same time,

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.762
all of us Chicago people
from the Annoyance theatre,

00:02:14.762 --> 00:02:15.900
like in the early '90s.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.620
And we started doing sketch
comedy and what is now

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.249
the UCB up on Tamarind there.

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:22.040
What was it called?

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.460
The Tamarind Theatre?

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.010
KATE FLANNERY: The
Tamarind Theatre, yeah.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.810
Up on Franklin.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.560
JANE LYNCH: Right.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.120
And we did.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.820
We would do these little,
like, sketch comedy shows.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.960
And any time I wanted
to do a song of Kate

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.270
wanted to do a song
we'd grab each other.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.154
And we've been singing together
for-- we did, "What a Pair".

00:02:36.154 --> 00:02:37.320
KATE FLANNERY: That's right.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.620
The benefit, yeah,
for breast cancer.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.703
JANE LYNCH: Show for breast
cancer. "What a Pair".

00:02:40.703 --> 00:02:42.830
And they have you sing duets.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.840
And so she and I did a duet.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.980
In fact, the song we did--
which Kate found, and we do it

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.049
in our show-- is Far
From the Home I Love.

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.340
Are you familiar with that,
from "Fiddler on the Roof"?

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.860
As it's kind of
an aching ballad.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.115
Well, she found this
terrific tome about it.

00:02:56.115 --> 00:02:57.990
KATE FLANNERY: It's like
a bongo drum version

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.540
that these two sisters did
on the "Ed Sullivan Show"

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.460
back in early '60s.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.580
And it's like, it's the-- it's
the most insane, fantastically

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.000
musically interesting
arrangement.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.960
JANE LYNCH: Has nothing to do
with the content of the song.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.370
KATE FLANNERY: Nothing.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.000
Nothing whatsoever.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.080
JANE LYNCH: Which is, you know,
aching for the home I love.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.210
But I love this man.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.550
And it's just like,
you know, they're--

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.470
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.730
JANE LYNCH: Shaking
their tits basically.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.820
They're the Barry Sisters.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.630
KATE FLANNERY: That's so true.

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.379
And what's funny is
that I thought, maybe,

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:24.180
one day I might get to lip
sync to it in a drag bar in LA.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.160
But we get sing with a live band
and in front of other people.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.560
JANE LYNCH: Yeah, it's amazing.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.970
And the harmonies are awesome.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.710
And it's just this
great belting number

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.680
that in fact, it's kind of
physically taxing, this song,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.809
the breathing and
everything, that we almost

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:38.600
pass out sometimes.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.920
KATE FLANNERY: It's so true.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.670
But it's worth it.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.250
JANE LYNCH: We did it in Utah
where the elevation is so high

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.500
that we literally had to be
sucking the oxygen off stage.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.792
We're like, but we stopped
in the middle of it.

00:03:48.792 --> 00:03:50.250
We had to stop in
the middle of it.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.030
Jesus Christ, this elevation.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.280
But it's a really fun song.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.960
KATE FLANNERY: But the
audience is worth it.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.910
It's worth all the
pain we go through.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:55.300
JANE LYNCH: Exactly

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.870
KATE FLANNERY: And really,
it's just, we just love it.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:57.730
JANE LYNCH: We give and we give.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.180
KEVIN VALK: Well,
I was going to say,

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.550
but what's so cool
about "See Jane Sing"

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.390
is that they're all really
small, intimate venues which

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.230
is awesome.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.940
because the audience
really gets to--

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:03.475
JANE LYNCH: Some have been huge.

00:04:03.475 --> 00:04:03.750
KEVIN VALK: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:04.610
JANE LYNCH: We've
done some huge.

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:05.845
But and that's great too.

00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:07.470
But there's something
about like, we're

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.386
doing it at Joe's Pub.

00:04:08.386 --> 00:04:09.240
And how many is it?

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.880
Like 250 or something?

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.330
KATE FLANNERY: I think so.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.690
It's pretty small, yeah.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.190
JANE LYNCH: It's
like a supper club.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.580
And it's kind of old school.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.352
It's got the candle or
the lamps on the tables.

00:04:16.352 --> 00:04:18.060
And you can order
dinner and have drinks.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.798
And yeah, it's going
to be really fun.

00:04:19.798 --> 00:04:21.339
KEVIN VALK: So
growing up in Chicago,

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.280
and you grew up, obviously,
in an Irish family,

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.150
with the name Flannery.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.890
KATE FLANNERY: Right.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.170
JANE LYNCH: So did
Lynch, by the way.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.222
KEVIN VALK: Lynch?

00:04:26.222 --> 00:04:26.760
Oh did you really?

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.070
KATE FLANNERY: Yes, Lynch, yes.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.160
Yes, yes.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.505
Yes, yes.

00:04:27.505 --> 00:04:27.591
KEVIN VALK: Irish?

00:04:27.591 --> 00:04:27.850
Look at this.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.308
KATE FLANNERY: Oh
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:04:29.308 --> 00:04:32.361
KEVIN VALK: So was music a big
influence in your guys family

00:04:32.361 --> 00:04:32.860
growing up?

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:33.265
Always present?

00:04:33.265 --> 00:04:33.467
KATE FLANNERY: Absolutely.

00:04:33.467 --> 00:04:35.720
Well, my dad had a
bar, Flannery's Tavern.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.530
And then I went on to
play a drunk on TV.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.247
What a stretch.

00:04:39.247 --> 00:04:40.080
KEVIN VALK: Perfect.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.996
KATE FLANNERY: But you
know, he had a jukebox.

00:04:41.996 --> 00:04:43.895
And if you didn't
know a song, he'd say,

00:04:43.895 --> 00:04:45.080
you don't know that song?

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.580
I remember him
always like, sort of,

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.413
you know, challenging
me to learn something.

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:49.840
And I loved old music back then.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.881
Because that was like,
the way that we connected.

00:04:51.881 --> 00:04:53.890
But I feel like
Jane's dad and my dad,

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.520
they were probably related.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.860
JANE LYNCH: They would
have loved each other.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.010
KATE FLANNERY: Were
probably related.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.440
JANE LYNCH: Yeah.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.815
KATE FLANNERY: Because
Ireland is so incestuous.

00:04:58.815 --> 00:04:59.470
JANE LYNCH: Yeah, exactly.

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.850
KATE FLANNERY: And so I'm
sure-- No doubt, right?

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.480
JANE LYNCH: Rapes and pillages.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.351
And there are no pure Irishmen.

00:05:06.351 --> 00:05:06.850
Yeah.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.160
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah, but
when you talk about Frank

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.600
in the show, it's so great.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.270
We get to do some songs
that you used to sing around

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.061
your kitchen table.

00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:13.125
Which I-- it's fantastic.

00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:13.390
JANE LYNCH: Yeah.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.735
KATE FLANNERY: So when my
dad came to see the show

00:05:14.735 --> 00:05:15.780
he just plugged right in.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.320
He just loved
every second of it.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.210
JANE LYNCH: Aw, yeah,
it was so great.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.740
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.550
JANE LYNCH: Yeah, her
dad is just a gem.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.259
Such a great guy.

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:21.091
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah.

00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:23.340
JANE LYNCH: But yeah, a
lot of the stuff that we're

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.572
singing in the
show came straight

00:05:25.572 --> 00:05:26.530
from the kitchen table.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.113
I used to sit around the kitchen
table with my mom and my dad.

00:05:29.113 --> 00:05:31.050
And my parents who were
terrific harmonizers.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.680
My dad sounded like Bing Crosby.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.000
He had a beautiful kind
of voice, like this.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.070
And you know, my
dad was a banker.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.090
My mom was a secretary.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.090
They were professionals.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.720
But I went on to do it.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.324
You know, I loved it so much.

00:05:44.324 --> 00:05:44.990
KEVIN VALK: Wow.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.190
And you did a turn on
Broadway in "Annie".

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.940
JANE LYNCH: I did.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:48.990
KEVIN VALK: As--

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.480
JANE LYNCH: Miss Hannigan.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.970
KEVIN VALK: Ms. Hannigan.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.570
And so what was that like, going
onto the big Broadway stage?

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.810
JANE LYNCH: Oh, it was great.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.140
You know, I hadn't
been on stage.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.130
And I think the
same for you, too.

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.320
I haven't really done
a play since I started

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.670
doing television in the '90s.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.607
So that's a couple of decades.

00:06:00.607 --> 00:06:01.690
So I hadn't been on stage.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.690
And I didn't think I
wanted to do stage anymore.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.193
It doesn't pay that much.

00:06:05.193 --> 00:06:08.410
It's real-- you know, when you
look, it's really hard work.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.830
But you know, getting
it up every night.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.830
And eight shows a week.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:14.910
And I loved it.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.440
I was reinfected with the bug.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.100
And I couldn't get enough of it.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.390
I did it for two months.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.520
And it was such a joy.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.250
In fact, that's how I met
the people at 54 Below.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.290
I got into the Broadway
community, as it were,

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:29.404
and they just
assumed I had an act.

00:06:29.404 --> 00:06:30.070
KEVIN VALK: Wow.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.910
KATE FLANNERY: She was
the best Miss Hannigan.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:31.740
I got to tell you.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:32.180
She was hilarious.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.513
She kind of reminded me of Lucy.

00:06:33.513 --> 00:06:34.410
You were so funny.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:34.960
JANE LYNCH: Oh thank you honey.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.500
KATE FLANNERY: And
such-- oh my god.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.360
Seriously.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.574
JANE LYNCH: My biggest fan.

00:06:37.574 --> 00:06:38.990
KATE FLANNERY: No,
I mean come on.

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.176
JANE LYNCH: Vice versey.

00:06:39.176 --> 00:06:40.925
KATE FLANNERY: Like, just
plbb, home run like, plbb,

00:06:40.925 --> 00:06:41.440
every night.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.430
Cell phones, annoying people in
the audience talking, whatever,

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.520
selfies, you don't--
she was [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.307
She's such a pro.

00:06:47.307 --> 00:06:49.640
KEVIN VALK: Is there a little
room for improv like that,

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.680
interacting with the
audience and kind

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.090
of calling them on that stuff?

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.950
JANE LYNCH: No.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.640
No, not in that.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:56.310
I was too afraid to step
outside of the bounds in that.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:56.650
KEVIN VALK: Not Hannigan.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:57.510
But I mean in "See Jane Sing".

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:58.635
JANE LYNCH: Oh, absolutely.

00:06:58.635 --> 00:06:59.240
Oh yeah, yeah.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.740
But what I love to do-- and I
know Kate does this too-- is I

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.460
like to script
every damn moment.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.300
I build a cage.

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.890
But then I bounce around
freely within the cage.

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.055
I need to know that
I've got that structure.

00:07:13.055 --> 00:07:15.000
You look like my
brother so much.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.250
KEVIN VALK: I am your brother.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.220
JANE LYNCH: Oh my god!

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:19.220
KEVIN VALK: You owe
me a lot of money.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:20.563
JANE LYNCH: We found out
we're from the same part

00:07:20.563 --> 00:07:20.860
of the country.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:21.800
Like, you know, minutes
from each other.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.660
KEVIN VALK: We're
both from Chicago.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:23.760
KATE FLANNERY:
And are you Irish?

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.550
See we're all ancestors.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.860
See?

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.330
KEVIN VALK: We're
both from Chicago,

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:25.920
I went Illinois
State University.

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:26.640
KATE FLANNERY: Oh
yeah, yes, yeah.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.990
JANE LYNCH: Downers
Grove is where he's from.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.216
Isn't that a hell of a name?

00:07:29.216 --> 00:07:30.340
KEVIN VALK: Hell of a name.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.915
JANE LYNCH: I'm
from Downers Grove.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.030
But our show is
extremely-- I mean,

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.650
I've got even my
hilarious patter that

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:43.555
looks like it's off the top of
my head, I've scripted within

00:07:43.555 --> 00:07:44.430
and inch of its life.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.040
But then I do bounce
around within that.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.260
Right?

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.490
And she's loosey goosey.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:48.180
KATE FLANNERY:
Always, every city.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.330
JANE LYNCH: Yeah, nothing's
the same twice for her.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.063
So and that keeps
me alive and going

00:07:52.063 --> 00:07:54.130
what is she going to do now?

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.300
KEVIN VALK: Now, is it fun to
kind of get back into that?

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.340
Because you guys were both on
scripted shows for so long.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.690
And so was it fun
to kind of get back?

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.440
Well, I guess you had a little
bit of improv in "The Office".

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.080
KATE FLANNERY: Not so much.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.070
I mean, sometimes.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.600
But again, that was a show
that was way more scripted

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:06.480
that you would have realized.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:06.920
You know?

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.470
KEVIN VALK: Yeah.

00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:09.011
KATE FLANNERY: But
yeah, no, totally.

00:08:09.011 --> 00:08:11.160
I mean, and that's the
fun of kind of getting

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.070
to use these muscles.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.010
I mean, we both started
out at Second City.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:18.920
And like, I feel we were
there at such a golden time.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.880
Even though we had our own
weird experiences withing all

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.830
that, like, the people that
we came up with, I mean,

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:27.330
I think about the people that
were there when we were there.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.310
JANE LYNCH: Stephen
Colbert, to drop some names.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:29.840
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.130
JANE LYNCH: And Steve Carell.

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:32.190
KATE FLANNERY: Nia
Vardalos, Amy Sedaris.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.140
KEVIN VALK: Andy
Richter, Tina Fey.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:33.830
Well, maybe Tina Fey--

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.179
JANE LYNCH: Tina
Fey, they're younger.

00:08:35.179 --> 00:08:35.760
KATE FLANNERY:
Yeah, a little bit.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.909
JANE LYNCH: Yeah, that was
the next generation down.

00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:38.570
KATE FLANNERY: But still, yeah.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:39.250
And you didn't know.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:39.700
I mean, who knew?

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.520
Like, the deadbeat.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.334
You never know.

00:08:41.334 --> 00:08:42.750
JANE LYNCH: You
were about to call

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.874
Stephen Colbert a deadbeat.

00:08:43.874 --> 00:08:44.847
KATE FLANNERY: No.

00:08:44.847 --> 00:08:45.930
KEVIN VALK: On the record.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.470
JANE LYNCH: He did go through
a kind of a very meek period.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.950
That's for sure.

00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:51.450
Yeah.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:52.616
KEVIN VALK: That's so funny.

00:08:52.616 --> 00:08:55.040
So what has been some
of your favorite moments

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.250
just from the tour and
doing the show together?

00:08:57.250 --> 00:09:00.550
JANE LYNCH: Well, this
one makes everything--

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.020
you know, we play off
each other very well.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.950
But I just don't
know what you're

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:06.700
going to do a lot of the time.

00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:08.340
And that keeps me on my toes.

00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:09.100
KATE FLANNERY: I have
no memory of this.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.100
JANE LYNCH: Because I'm
kind of a control freak.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.120
But I love the
stuff you throw in.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.770
And she knows.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:15.850
I tell her all the time.

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.229
I couldn't do this
show without her.

00:09:18.229 --> 00:09:20.020
KATE FLANNERY: Well,
Jane is very generous.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.770
Because I'll tell you,
I mean, I feel like I'm

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:27.672
just there just to keep the--

00:09:27.672 --> 00:09:28.880
JANE LYNCH: Ridiculous going.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:29.500
She's insane.

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:30.530
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah,
and just kind of keep

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:31.750
an extra ball in the air.

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:32.090
That's the thing.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.673
It's like, you think
you're just going

00:09:33.673 --> 00:09:37.680
to see this TV star who's going
to, you know, enjoy herself.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:39.999
Maybe not more than you are.

00:09:39.999 --> 00:09:41.040
You know what I'm saying?

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.070
JANE LYNCH: Hostage situations.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.630
We all know what those are.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:43.000
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.291
But like, I love that Jane
has like-- she stepped it up

00:09:45.291 --> 00:09:46.589
with an amazing band.

00:09:46.589 --> 00:09:49.130
And then with Tim Davis, it just
takes a whole like, vocally,

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.190
like, there's so much going on.

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:51.544
And she could just phone it in.

00:09:51.544 --> 00:09:52.210
But she doesn't.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:52.800
You know?

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.570
JANE LYNCH: We have so much fun.

00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:55.111
KATE FLANNERY: You
could email it in.

00:09:55.111 --> 00:09:56.700
People would still enjoy it.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.980
But she, you know, Jane
really works really hard.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.930
And it's like, I
feel like, you know,

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:03.846
you get your money's
worth is what I'm saying.

00:10:03.846 --> 00:10:04.232
It's worth it.

00:10:04.232 --> 00:10:04.731
Seriously.

00:10:04.731 --> 00:10:05.530
JANE LYNCH: It is.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:06.860
And now it's a
little over an hour.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.250
Which all the
promoters are grateful.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:09.820
Because they were like,
you got to add more stuff.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:12.007
And I didn't want to add
things just to add them.

00:10:12.007 --> 00:10:12.840
You know the saying.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.800
You know, do two or
three more songs.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.966
And it was like, well, wait.

00:10:15.966 --> 00:10:17.940
I just can't do two
or three more songs.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.705
I need to feel compelled
to put them in.

00:10:20.705 --> 00:10:23.111
And so now we're
actually over an hour.

00:10:23.111 --> 00:10:25.360
If we did the whole show
with Tim opening and the band

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.550
doing their stuff we're
probably an hour 20 now.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:30.257
Which at the promoters are like,
they're very happy with that.

00:10:30.257 --> 00:10:31.590
KATE FLANNERY: Sell more drinks.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:32.980
JANE LYNCH: Yeah,
sell some more drinks.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.938
And you know, people want
to-- I understand it.

00:10:34.938 --> 00:10:37.751
People want to feel like they've
had a complete experience when

00:10:37.751 --> 00:10:38.250
you go out.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:39.700
Because the tickets
aren't cheap.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.061
We don't come cheap.

00:10:41.061 --> 00:10:42.534
And we're not cheap.

00:10:42.534 --> 00:10:45.160
You want to feel like, an
hour show and it's like what?

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.590
So you know, they do
a little intermission

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:48.549
depending on the venue.

00:10:48.549 --> 00:10:50.089
Sometimes they'll
do an intermission.

00:10:50.089 --> 00:10:51.586
But you do want
them to-- like, we

00:10:51.586 --> 00:10:52.960
have this song,
The Party's Over,

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.159
which means the show's over.

00:10:54.159 --> 00:10:55.200
And people are like what?

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.250
KATE FLANNERY: They
freak out, yeah.

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:56.410
JANE LYNCH: What?

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:57.580
We just sat down.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:59.757
And so we've certainly
made it longer.

00:10:59.757 --> 00:11:02.340
But like I said, I didn't want
to add things just to add them.

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.250
KATE FLANNERY: Right
and less is more.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:04.085
Let's face it, right?

00:11:04.085 --> 00:11:04.130
Honest to god.

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:04.796
JANE LYNCH: Yes.

00:11:04.796 --> 00:11:08.100
And I've been a student of
less is more my entire life.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.742
And I have sat
through those shows

00:11:09.742 --> 00:11:11.950
where people-- where you
lose interest in the person.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.370
In fact, you get angry at them.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.420
It's like, if you do
one more song dedicated

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:18.695
to your inner child I'm
going throw something at you.

00:11:18.695 --> 00:11:20.320
KEVIN VALK: Well, it
must be fun, also,

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.855
to bring Tim Davis out
from just arranging stuff

00:11:22.855 --> 00:11:24.045
and actually coming and
being with you guys.

00:11:24.045 --> 00:11:24.249
JANE LYNCH: Yeah.

00:11:24.249 --> 00:11:25.890
Well, these two--
and I would say

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:27.830
I have a pretty
good ear too-- Tim

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:32.600
and Kate and I do these
really tight, crazy tight

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.570
three-part harmonies.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.060
And then they back
me up sometimes.

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:38.101
I don't even know that
they're going to do it.

00:11:38.101 --> 00:11:39.600
Like when I'm doing
a song by myself

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.647
and I hear them doing
the oohs in the back, ah.

00:11:41.647 --> 00:11:43.355
And you just-- they
pick them up so fast.

00:11:43.355 --> 00:11:43.660
KATE FLANNERY: We're oozing.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.419
We're just oozing.

00:11:44.419 --> 00:11:45.210
JANE LYNCH: Oozing.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:45.930
KATE FLANNERY: Oozing love.

00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:47.250
JANE LYNCH: And a la sometimes.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.679
Yeah, so that's
what's great about it.

00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:53.220
And Tim, indeed, is
a vocal arranger.

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:55.290
But she's-- holds her own.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.660
She can figure out
her part like that.

00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:58.110
And I'm pretty good at it too.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:00.151
KATE FLANNERY: I usually
don't sing without a wig

00:12:00.151 --> 00:12:01.510
on though, just so you know.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.745
JANE LYNCH: But yeah,
it is great having Tim.

00:12:02.745 --> 00:12:04.090
And Tim is a wonderful crooner.

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.589
And he's got a great
sense of humor.

00:12:05.589 --> 00:12:06.740
He's a goof.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:08.200
And he's a very handsome guy.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.820
And he comes out in his
tuxedo and sings with the band

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:12.670
before we start.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:13.586
Which is kind of nice.

00:12:13.586 --> 00:12:15.960
And the band itself, they're
really entertaining guys.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.090
And they have their own
special thing that they do.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:19.260
And they're very funny.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.940
KATE FLANNERY: They have
sort of an early '60s vibe.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.970
So they're very well dressed
but they really swing it baby.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:23.410
JANE LYNCH: Skinny ties.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:25.170
KATE FLANNERY: They
swing it, man, you know.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.340
JANE LYNCH: Yeah, and they
say things like that's

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.234
bitchin' man.

00:12:30.056 --> 00:12:31.930
KEVIN VALK: So what was
the evolution of that

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.350
in terms of coming up with
like, the idea to take it

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:36.242
into that era and do that?

00:12:36.242 --> 00:12:38.700
JANE LYNCH: It all happened
that naturally and organically,

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:42.160
which is the best way for these
types of things to happen.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:42.950
Tim introduced me.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:44.730
I said I wanted a
three-piece band in LA.

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.300
Because it was out in New
York I had my three-piece band

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:47.800
originally.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.660
And so I said, I
need a band out here.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:50.630
He said, well, I
have a five piece.

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.400
And I was like, well,
can I use three?

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.350
And he says listen.

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:54.520
Just listen to them.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.200
And these guys are amazing.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:00.570
And it just-- our first
rehearsal just, I went OK,

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:01.855
we're taking all five guys.

00:13:01.855 --> 00:13:03.396
KATE FLANNERY: It
was so interesting.

00:13:03.396 --> 00:13:06.030
Every time we do a
show I feel like we

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:07.305
like each other more and more.

00:13:07.305 --> 00:13:09.180
Like, we actually watch
earlier and earlier.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:10.596
Like, sometimes,
you don't walk on

00:13:10.596 --> 00:13:12.090
till you're about to perform.

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:13.210
So you don't like,
listen to other people.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:14.130
I mean, some people do.

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:15.560
Selfish actors,
selfish performers.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.340
JANE LYNCH: Not us, of course.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:17.256
KATE FLANNERY: Not us.

00:13:17.256 --> 00:13:19.500
But we actually, like, enjoy
it like, more and more,

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.320
I feel like.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.230
Which is amazing.

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:22.314
Usually it's the opposite.

00:13:22.314 --> 00:13:24.563
You like people less and
less when you tour with them.

00:13:24.563 --> 00:13:26.320
So it's kind of like,
I said it out loud.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.180
So now i jinxed it.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.275
So now we're going to
go in the backslide.

00:13:28.275 --> 00:13:29.200
But that's all right.

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.658
JANE LYNCH: But we do early
earlier and earlier-- or later.

00:13:31.658 --> 00:13:34.190
Sorry, Is it later and
later in the opening act,

00:13:34.190 --> 00:13:35.670
she and I are out there now.

00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:36.560
What is the earlier?

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:37.850
We watch the whole
thing now I guess.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:38.540
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah we do.

00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:38.710
Yeah.

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.640
JANE LYNCH: Space and time
is screwing me up right now.

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.120
But yeah, we go out and watch
them, watch the whole thing.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.250
And it's so fun.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:49.210
But also, we don't
do a lot of dates.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:50.830
We're not out for
months at a time.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.910
And I think that's when the
hate brews, is when it's day

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:55.290
after day, night after night.

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.070
Now we see each other, we meet
at the airport and we're like,

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:58.570
yay!

00:13:58.570 --> 00:13:59.725
It's so great to see you.

00:13:59.725 --> 00:14:00.434
It's a nice thing

00:14:00.434 --> 00:14:01.516
KATE FLANNERY: Rare thing.

00:14:01.516 --> 00:14:03.430
KEVIN VALK: You guys
have talked about your

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:05.680
sitting around the dinner
table and coming up, having

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:06.400
these songs with your family.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.358
So what were some of your
influences coming up?

00:14:08.358 --> 00:14:11.100
And what were some of
those songs growing up?

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:14.210
KATE FLANNERY: Well, the
Irish thing, like Bing Crosby,

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:14.710
of course.

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:18.650
I mean, just also
like, those early '60s

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:22.450
songs that my parents hooked up
like, songs from "My Fair Lady"

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:25.740
and like, I remember always,
like, singing doing the dishes.

00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:28.330
That was like, the
showtunes thing.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.610
But like, sort of very
specific-- I don't know.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:34.970
I think that there's, of
course, like Frank Sinatra.

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:39.070
There's something--
there's like a zeitgeist

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.655
that we're hitting in a weird--
but it's much more eclectic

00:14:41.655 --> 00:14:42.280
than just that.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.600
Because there's songs from
Mighty Wind that we do too.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.914
Anyway.

00:14:45.914 --> 00:14:47.455
JANE LYNCH: So we
have, at one point,

00:14:47.455 --> 00:14:49.530
I noticed that, except
for the Mighty Wind stuff,

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:52.730
we weren't singing anything
that was written past 1960.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.820
And then are you familiar
with Flying Machine?

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.650
That group from the '60s,
they sang that song-- they're

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.800
a one-hit wonder-- "Smile a
Little Smile for Me Rosemarie?"

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.526
We added that.

00:15:01.526 --> 00:15:03.150
If you come to the
show you'll hear it.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.450
It's a sweet little pop song.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.540
Most of the stuff is
of that zeitgeist,

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.990
of like, the '60s and '50s
and even back to the '40s.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.930
And we do a song from you know,
Coney Island is from the 1920s.

00:15:15.930 --> 00:15:17.346
KATE FLANNERY:
Right right, right.

00:15:17.346 --> 00:15:17.850
Yeah.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:23.460
JANE LYNCH: But we just
added Nicki Minaj "Anaconda"

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.440
for the kids.

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.659
KEVIN VALK: For the kids.

00:15:25.659 --> 00:15:27.450
I was going to ask if
there's any of that--

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:27.870
KATE FLANNERY: She's a pleaser.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:28.080
She's a pleaser.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.230
JANE LYNCH: We knock it
out of the fricking park.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:30.063
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah.

00:15:30.063 --> 00:15:30.720
She kills it.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.760
That's a hard thing.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.566
Holy crap.

00:15:32.566 --> 00:15:33.940
JANE LYNCH: I do
most of the rap.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.940
KATE FLANNERY: She does.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.850
JANE LYNCH: But we do it, we
do the chorus in a beautiful

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.680
three-part harmony,
that is just--

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.050
KATE FLANNERY: We're so white.

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:40.550
Oh my god.

00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:45.850
JANE LYNCH: And even the band is
like-- Yeah, it's pretty great.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.200
And then to see them,
like, dancing, trying to.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:48.939
We're so white.

00:15:48.939 --> 00:15:49.855
KATE FLANNERY: We are.

00:15:49.855 --> 00:15:50.680
JANE LYNCH: We're so white.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:50.760
KATE FLANNERY: It's
never going to change.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:52.843
JANE LYNCH: And we're like,
doing the street thing

00:15:52.843 --> 00:15:53.830
as best we can.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:55.422
So it's fun to watch.

00:15:55.422 --> 00:15:57.630
KEVIN VALK: So is that where
all the ideas come from?

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.171
It's just from all three of you
guys just spitting out stuff?

00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:01.150
JANE LYNCH: Yeah, yeah.

00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:01.650
Absolutely.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:02.640
KEVIN VALK: And so it evolves
throughout the whole tour?

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.920
JANE LYNCH: Right, like
oh this tickles me.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.530
Let's do that.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:07.090
Or the newest thing we're doing
that we're going to premiere,

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:09.592
we're doing University
of California Davis

00:16:09.592 --> 00:16:10.300
over the weekend.

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.620
And I think you're going to
come, which will be great.

00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:13.040
KATE FLANNERY: No pressure.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.640
JANE LYNCH: And we will be
premiering our songs that

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.890
made us cry as children medley.

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:21.574
We were in the van.

00:16:21.574 --> 00:16:23.990
I was talking about how, Puff
the Magic Dragon, when I was

00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:25.540
a kid, used to make me weep.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.680
The part about Jackie
Paper came no more

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.332
and oh, it just broke my heart.

00:16:29.332 --> 00:16:31.790
I had a little phonograph and
I would play it over and over

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:32.290
again.

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:33.757
And I would be beside myself.

00:16:33.757 --> 00:16:36.340
And everybody started piping up,
the songs that made them cry.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:40.400
Tura Lura Lura, which
is an Irish lullaby.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.219
For Tony it was a Seasons
in the Sun, Goodbye Papa

00:16:43.219 --> 00:16:44.010
Please Pray for Me.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:45.180
Remember that?

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.466
And Ben, Michael Jackson's Ben.

00:16:47.466 --> 00:16:48.090
He ain't heavy.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.673
He's my bro-- you're
going to be like,

00:16:49.673 --> 00:16:51.270
on the floor
spiraling into despair

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.330
at the end of this medley.

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:54.586
So we'll be premiering that.

00:16:54.586 --> 00:16:55.450
KATE FLANNERY: We
will affect you.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:55.730
JANE LYNCH: Yes.

00:16:55.730 --> 00:16:56.290
KEVIN VALK: Very cool.

00:16:56.290 --> 00:16:57.100
JANE LYNCH: We will affect you.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.400
KEVIN VALK: So do you guys
have any funny stories

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.270
just from the tour?

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:00.343
Because live theater,
everything's live.

00:17:00.343 --> 00:17:01.140
So there's mistakes.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.015
And there's little goofs
and stuff like that.

00:17:03.015 --> 00:17:04.030
JANE LYNCH: Not really.

00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:06.869
I know that everybody
wants to hear oh one time

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:08.205
the drums fell off the stage.

00:17:08.205 --> 00:17:10.788
And we were like, what?

00:17:10.788 --> 00:17:11.329
But yeah, no.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:13.390
We don't really have
those things thank god.

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:13.890
Not yet.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:14.150
Not yet.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:15.982
KEVIN VALK: I just jinxed
it for tomorrow night.

00:17:15.982 --> 00:17:16.390
JANE LYNCH: Yeah.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.431
The drums are now going
to fall off the platform.

00:17:18.431 --> 00:17:19.765
KEVIN VALK: Yeah, it's terrible.

00:17:19.765 --> 00:17:21.639
You guys can start lining
up at the mics too.

00:17:21.639 --> 00:17:23.359
We're going to start
taking questions.

00:17:23.359 --> 00:17:26.245
So what is something that you
guys just haven't done before?

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:27.619
Like so you've
done live theatre.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:28.359
You guys have done TV.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:29.040
You've done improv.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.330
Is there anything that you guys
haven't done before after the--

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:31.715
KATE FLANNERY: Porn.

00:17:31.715 --> 00:17:32.330
JANE LYNCH: That we want to.

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:32.620
KEVIN VALK: Yeah.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:33.090
KATE FLANNERY: Porn.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:33.460
JANE LYNCH: Porn.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.420
KATE FLANNERY:
Have not done porn.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:34.870
KEVIN VALK: Porn.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:36.730
I think Meredith, your character
on "The Office", was doing--

00:17:36.730 --> 00:17:38.230
JANE LYNCH: I think
the next logical step.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:40.481
KATE FLANNERY: Let me tell
you, NBC, no, very blurred.

00:17:40.481 --> 00:17:42.146
My parents went through
a lot with that.

00:17:42.146 --> 00:17:43.350
But it was very blurred out.

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.270
It could have been a lot worse.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.478
No granted, the cameramen
never looked at me at lunch

00:17:46.478 --> 00:17:48.120
when we shot any
of those scenes.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.370
Never looked at me in the eye.

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:50.057
No eye contact.

00:17:50.057 --> 00:17:51.640
But yeah, it could've
been much worse.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:51.835
Yeah.

00:17:51.835 --> 00:17:52.320
JANE LYNCH: You know what?

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:53.940
I don't have goals anymore.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.800
I just don't.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.760
I've found that they're
a waste of energy.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:02.150
And what rolls in at my feet
is usually-- or you know,

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:06.160
like 54 Below's saying
come do a cabaret old chum.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.210
And I said, yeah.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.180
OK, let's do that.

00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:09.800
So I enjoy that kind of a thing.

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.560
And then things
happen organically

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.510
and I'm not running
around like a chicken

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.680
with its head cut off.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.780
Like what's next?

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:17.670
What's next?

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:18.540
KEVIN VALK: And do you
guys have a favorite city

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.240
that you guys have
done as New York--

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.330
because I mean, New York
population is-- I mean,

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:22.820
JANE LYNCH: New York's OK.

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:23.650
KEVIN VALK: Broadway's there.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:24.080
Eh.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:24.913
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah.

00:18:24.913 --> 00:18:25.752
It's no LA.

00:18:25.752 --> 00:18:27.710
JANE LYNCH: Well, what
was really fun, we did--

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:28.050
[CHEER FROM AUDIENCE]

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:28.883
JANE LYNCH: Exactly.

00:18:28.883 --> 00:18:30.320
We just did Beverly Hills.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:32.717
Which a great theater, the
Annenberg, it's a new space.

00:18:32.717 --> 00:18:33.550
Kind of a new space.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:34.000
It's about five years old.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:34.600
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.058
JANE LYNCH: What
a great space too.

00:18:36.058 --> 00:18:38.730
And so all of our friends got
to come, some of our family.

00:18:38.730 --> 00:18:40.880
And the band, most of them
are from Orange County.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.220
So their wives and
kids all came out.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:44.230
And that was great.

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.070
KATE FLANNERY: And Dick Van
Dyke sat in the front row.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.870
JANE LYNCH: Dick Van Dyke
sat in the front row.

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:48.036
KATE FLANNERY: And stood up.

00:18:48.036 --> 00:18:49.482
And oh my god, I was so nervous.

00:18:49.482 --> 00:18:50.190
JANE LYNCH: Yeah.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:51.290
Yeah, that was enormous.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:52.010
KATE FLANNERY: Why did
that make me so nervous?

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.960
JANE LYNCH: I wish we had
that-- the reason I had "Smile a

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.890
Little Smile For
Me Rosemarie" is

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.180
because when I used to watch
"The Dick Van Dyke Show",

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:00.220
Rosemarie.

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:03.190
The actress, used to
break my heart because she

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.450
didn't have a boyfriend.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:06.710
Well, Herman Glimsher,
but he couldn't commit.

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:11.200
So I thought that song Rosemarie
was for her, for her character.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.659
So I wish that I had had that
when Dick Van Dyke was there.

00:19:13.659 --> 00:19:14.700
KATE FLANNERY: I'm sorry.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.480
He so loved it.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:16.230
JANE LYNCH: Yeah, he
was quite pleased.

00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:17.170
KEVIN VALK: Well, while
we're in that era,

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:17.940
I kind of want to talk about it.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.130
Because you sang with
Carol Burnett on "Glee".

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:20.400
JANE LYNCH: Yes.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.970
KEVIN VALK: And did you
guys do that on tour too?

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:22.890
Did so she come?

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:23.710
JANE LYNCH: No.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:23.780
KEVIN VALK: No, OK.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:24.950
JANE LYNCH: No,
we didn't do that.

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:26.790
KEVIN VALK: I mean, how
incredible was that?

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:28.450
JANE LYNCH: Yeah,
pretty outrageous.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:31.319
And pretty much one of
those things where you go

00:19:31.319 --> 00:19:32.360
is this really happening?

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.260
KEVIN VALK: You sang
the Trolley song.

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:34.690
JANE LYNCH: Yeah, we
sang The Trolley Song

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.060
from "Meet Me in St. Louis".

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:39.175
And we also sang the Ohio
Song from "Wonderful Town".

00:19:39.175 --> 00:19:40.300
Wasn't it "Wonderful Town"?

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:40.555
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah.

00:19:40.555 --> 00:19:40.810
JANE LYNCH: Yeah.

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:41.730
And she chose them.

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:43.563
Because when she was
on the show Ryan always

00:19:43.563 --> 00:19:46.607
said-- he gave her kind of a
what would you like to sing?

00:19:46.607 --> 00:19:47.940
What era would you like to sing?

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.420
And then she got to
make the final choice.

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.917
So yeah, it was really great.

00:19:51.917 --> 00:19:52.750
It was a lot of fun.

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:55.380
She's a great human being.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:58.040
And I grew up watching her show.

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:01.090
And she inspired me.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:03.860
I didn't know I wanted to
do sketch comedy so much.

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:05.840
But I knew that
kind of fun that she

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.384
was having, that kind of
creative fun, was what

00:20:08.384 --> 00:20:09.550
I wanted to do with my life.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:11.925
Because they always looked
like they were having a blast.

00:20:11.925 --> 00:20:14.869
And I have it from her that they
were, indeed, having a blast.

00:20:14.869 --> 00:20:16.660
And what I loved about
Carol Burnett was it

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.868
was "The Carol Burnett Show".

00:20:17.868 --> 00:20:21.150
But it was also the Harvey
Korman show and the Lyle

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:23.650
Waggoner show and the Tim Conway
show and the Vicki Lawrence

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:24.150
show.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:25.280
They all got to shine.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.230
It wasn't just about her.

00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.372
She was a member of the
ensemble just as they were.

00:20:29.372 --> 00:20:30.080
And I loved that.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.496
KATE FLANNERY:
Which also, I mean,

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:33.254
that's the great
thing about-- I mean,

00:20:33.254 --> 00:20:34.670
the big surprise
about Jane's show

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:36.253
is that she actually
shares the stage.

00:20:36.253 --> 00:20:40.097
I mean, I feel like that's the
most generous thing you can do.

00:20:40.097 --> 00:20:42.180
JANE LYNCH: I don't want
to be out anywhere alone.

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:42.600
I don't.

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:44.058
I don't ever want
to perform alone.

00:20:44.058 --> 00:20:45.270
I have no desire.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.142
No desire.

00:20:46.142 --> 00:20:47.850
No desire to just
stand there and go, now

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:49.622
here's a story
from my childhood.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:55.599
KEVIN VALK: Go ahead.

00:20:55.599 --> 00:20:56.140
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.790
JANE LYNCH: Hi.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:59.900
AUDIENCE: Thank you
guys for coming so much.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:01.310
My question is
that you both were

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:02.700
on shows that have
kind of become

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.692
these cultural icons and
cultural phenomenons, "Glee"

00:21:05.692 --> 00:21:06.400
and "The Office".

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.900
I'm wondering if you
can talk about one,

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.526
what your last day on set with
those great ensembles was like?

00:21:12.526 --> 00:21:14.900
And then also if there was a
moment working with the cast

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.120
when you felt like this is
really something special.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.310
This is different
than my usual work?

00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:20.400
JANE LYNCH: Yeah, well,
I will go first then.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.900
Because I know you
have stories too.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.000
But we just ended.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.204
And one of our last days,
it was almost the last day.

00:21:28.204 --> 00:21:29.495
It was like, third to last day.

00:21:29.495 --> 00:21:31.980
We did a song, I lived.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.610
That song, I live,
where everybody,

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:37.060
anybody who had guested on
our show was invited to be in.

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:38.670
And tons of them came.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:41.325
And it was so emotional.

00:21:41.325 --> 00:21:44.490
And it was also
dedicating the auditorium

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.200
to Cory Monteith's
character, which was

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.180
very moving and very, very sad.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.280
And yet, very uplifting
all at the same time.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.260
So that was my big memory,
the big emotional occurrence.

00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.510
And I remember the pilot.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.670
Shooting the pilot when the
kids were singing don't stop,

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:00.961
believe-- don't stop believing.

00:22:00.961 --> 00:22:02.730
And they were just
wearing red t-shirts.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.140
There was no production values.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.010
They were on an empty stage.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:09.710
And I remember my
character watches it like,

00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:11.140
kind of scowling over at them.

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.569
And I thought, oh my
god, this is so-- this

00:22:13.569 --> 00:22:14.610
is going to be a big hit.

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:15.109
This is.

00:22:15.109 --> 00:22:17.460
If it's not a big
hit it's going to be

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.590
a small hit with somebody.

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:20.830
You know, that it'll be
a small group of people

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:21.580
that will love it.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:24.870
But it was so moving and
so raw and so beautiful.

00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:28.784
And so that's my "Glee" story.

00:22:28.784 --> 00:22:30.200
KATE FLANNERY: I
have to tell you,

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.920
I was still waiting tables when
I got the job on "The Office".

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.416
So my life completely changed.

00:22:34.416 --> 00:22:35.540
I'm kind of a late bloomer.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:36.581
I've always been working.

00:22:36.581 --> 00:22:39.120
But couldn't-- I didn't
quite-- I'm too picky.

00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:41.550
And I feel like I didn't
latch on to the right thing.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:43.410
So when I got "The
Office" I didn't

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:45.140
know what it was going to be.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:50.316
And initially there
were like, six of us

00:22:50.316 --> 00:22:52.690
that were considered guest
stars until the second season.

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:54.773
Then they finally made us
regulars, even though we

00:22:54.773 --> 00:22:56.840
were in every episode.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:58.250
And we were doing Booze Cruise.

00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:59.630
We were shooting the
Booze Cruise episode.

00:22:59.630 --> 00:23:01.463
And I just remember
feeling like, oh my god.

00:23:01.463 --> 00:23:03.090
Like, this is really happening.

00:23:03.090 --> 00:23:05.290
This is really happening.

00:23:05.290 --> 00:23:08.220
That was the same year we were
first nominated for an Emmy.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:08.940
And we won.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:13.230
And I just feel like
my experience, like I

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.910
even if I didn't talk for like,
two weeks on that show, like,

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:21.150
I knew I was in something
incredibly special and smart.

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:24.960
And I always felt like
everyone-- especially

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:27.340
the first few years and
Steve Carell in particular,

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:29.800
he was never-- it
was never about him.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.824
Even though he
carried most of it.

00:23:31.824 --> 00:23:33.080
He had most of the lines.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.370
He never made it about him.

00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:37.380
He always made it about
the work and the ensemble.

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.670
And I felt like even
getting the camera

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.590
to have a look
had so much power.

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.692
So I knew, like, I didn't
have to count my lines.

00:23:43.692 --> 00:23:45.150
I didn't have to
judge any of that.

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:46.940
I just trusted
that everything was

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.170
going to get revealed
the way it should.

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:51.290
And I'm so happy that that
was actually the case.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:53.820
And I was so happy
to be the person that

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.190
got to do physical comedy.

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:56.149
And I had my own thing.

00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.648
In

00:23:56.648 --> 00:23:58.720
And less was kind of
more but in a great way.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:00.390
I never felt like I
outwore my welcome.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:02.306
I feel like people were
really rooting for me.

00:24:02.306 --> 00:24:06.050
So I just had an amazing
experience for nine seasons.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:08.570
And I feel like no
matter what happens,

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:12.044
if I'm only known as a
drunken floozy from that show,

00:24:12.044 --> 00:24:13.727
I'm happy.

00:24:13.727 --> 00:24:14.560
JANE LYNCH: Not bad.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:15.120
Not bad.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.310
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah,
not too shabby.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.100
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.141
KATE FLANNERY: Thank you.

00:24:20.618 --> 00:24:21.620
JANE LYNCH: Hey.

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:23.286
AUDIENCE: So you guys
spoke about having

00:24:23.286 --> 00:24:25.150
a break between when
you were last on stage

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:26.640
and when you returned
to the stage.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.020
I'm curious of what
you've seen in terms

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.540
of differences in the audience.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:30.610
You mentioned selfies.

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:33.304
You mentioned photos.

00:24:33.304 --> 00:24:34.970
I guess you missed
sort of the beginning

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.451
of the big technology,
sort of blast.

00:24:37.451 --> 00:24:38.200
JANE LYNCH: Right.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.908
AUDIENCE: So I'm
curious what you've seen

00:24:39.908 --> 00:24:41.800
and also how that impacted
you as a performer

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.310
and how you deal with that?

00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:44.145
JANE LYNCH: It
hasn't-- you know,

00:24:44.145 --> 00:24:46.490
because when I went back to
Broadway-- back to Broadway.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:49.270
Actually, it was
my Broadway debut.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:52.300
But it was me going
back to theater.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.975
The audiences changed
because on Broadway it's

00:24:54.975 --> 00:24:56.670
a lot of tourists.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:25:00.440
And it didn't change the
way any of us performed.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.442
But I noticed that
nobody's dressing up

00:25:02.442 --> 00:25:03.650
to go to the theater anymore.

00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:04.860
There's a lot of cargo
shorts and fanny packs.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.432
KEVIN VALK: A lot of this.

00:25:06.432 --> 00:25:07.140
JANE LYNCH: Yeah.

00:25:07.140 --> 00:25:11.680
And but you know, that's OK.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.050
And I think this
always happened,

00:25:14.050 --> 00:25:15.990
at least in the
last 10 or 15 years.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:17.590
If there's a star
on Broadway there's

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.900
always a line of people
at the stage door

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.160
who want photographs
and autographs.

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.580
And that certainly wasn't
the case when the last time

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:28.490
I did theater.

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:30.790
And there's a lot
more electronic media,

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:35.080
like Broadway.com does a
whole electronic media thing.

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.870
But it really hasn't
effect- it did not

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:43.150
affect at all the way I perform
or my experience on stage.

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:44.480
It was just a joy to go back.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:45.939
But things definitely
have changed.

00:25:45.939 --> 00:25:47.771
KATE FLANNERY: I just
remember actually Jane

00:25:47.771 --> 00:25:50.540
and I did the same play in New
York but at different times.

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:53.240
So it was Nora Ephron's play
"Love, Loss, and What I Wore".

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:55.110
And I did it, I
think, five years ago.

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:56.420
I think I did it like,
a year after you did.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.086
JANE LYNCH: Mhm.

00:25:57.086 --> 00:25:59.560
KATE FLANNERY: And I
remember someone's phone

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.490
rang in the audience.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:01.823
And they actually took the call.

00:26:01.823 --> 00:26:03.010
And they were talking.

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.220
And the audience
wanted to kill them.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:06.000
I said something.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.206
I said, I had some
killer snappy comeback.

00:26:09.206 --> 00:26:10.551
JANE LYNCH: I'm sure you did.

00:26:10.551 --> 00:26:11.050
Whakka.

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:13.120
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah,
but I still felt

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.420
like I couldn't stop
what was happening.

00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.650
But I felt like the audience
sort of shut it down.

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:20.742
So I've never seen that before.

00:26:20.742 --> 00:26:23.075
That's kind of been like,
that was like, the major like,

00:26:23.075 --> 00:26:24.820
what is happening?

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.500
There is sort of an
unconscious thing

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.580
that happens with live shows.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:32.547
But I think that's part of
we're all sort of negotiating

00:26:32.547 --> 00:26:33.380
this new technology.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.300
And there is no protocol.

00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.224
There should be.

00:26:36.224 --> 00:26:36.890
But there's not.

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:39.264
Like, people that used to have
to go to a telephone booth

00:26:39.264 --> 00:26:40.750
before and now there's no booth.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.950
So you know.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:46.910
But I think that, unfortunately,
theatre's really expensive.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:49.500
But it doesn't keep out the
people that are unconscious.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.550
They have money too.

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:51.820
JANE LYNCH: I've seen people
get up to go to the bathroom

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.657
like they're at a movie theater.

00:26:53.657 --> 00:26:55.240
And I would just
never think about it.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.240
I wouldn't do that.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.900
Because when you get up,
there are live people up there

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.150
who are focusing on something.

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:02.910
And you're like, excuse me.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.150
And then they come back.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:05.690
And they waddle
back down the aisle.

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:06.360
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah,
they don't wait

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.519
for like, a break in
the-- like, you know,

00:27:08.519 --> 00:27:09.560
there's no consciousness.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.590
JANE LYNCH: They shouldn't
let them back in too, I think.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.690
KATE FLANNERY: Punishment.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:13.190
JANE LYNCH: You
should have to wait.

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:15.880
Because there's monitors in the
lobby for most of the theaters.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.963
You can watch the play
from a monitor in the lobby

00:27:17.963 --> 00:27:18.750
if you want.

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:19.840
KEVIN VALK: So has that
been fun for you guys?

00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:22.350
Because with social media,
with Instagram and Twitter

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.725
and everything, and Facebook,
like going out and like,

00:27:24.725 --> 00:27:26.850
touching your fans, being
able to engage with them,

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:27.772
has that been pretty cool?

00:27:27.772 --> 00:27:29.540
KATE FLANNERY: It's
kind of horrifying.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.360
KEVIN VALK: You
have to be careful.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:30.510
KATE FLANNERY: It is.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.551
It's a little horrifying.

00:27:31.551 --> 00:27:33.630
Because there is
a sense of-- like,

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:35.440
I have to be a little
more self conscious

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.970
than I normally would be.

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:38.530
And I just have
to figure out, OK,

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:41.650
what, who needs to know what?

00:27:41.650 --> 00:27:44.791
Like, and also like,
who gives a flying shit?

00:27:44.791 --> 00:27:47.040
I just feel like sometimes
there's-- I remember having

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.998
to do, like, a celebrity
blog for "The Office".

00:27:48.998 --> 00:27:51.020
Like, I did "The Office"
blog for TVGuide.com.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:53.380
And I thought, someone did
it before me who was like,

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:54.570
we all had raisins today.

00:27:54.570 --> 00:27:56.570
Like, they were saying
like, the dumbest things.

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.570
And I felt like I needed
to have a point of view.

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:00.820
So I was like, you know,
who's the drunk in the corner

00:28:00.820 --> 00:28:01.870
watching everybody?

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:03.744
But for me I just feel
like sometimes there's

00:28:03.744 --> 00:28:05.330
such an egocentric
thing that happens

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:08.250
with a sense of celebrity,
even at the smallest level.

00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:09.870
But I think we're
all sort of like,

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:13.300
negotiating your
ability to stick around,

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.540
people's-- you know, it's
like you can't-- I don't know.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:18.870
I just think it's a
really slippery slope.

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:19.930
But people are great.

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:21.910
And I do love the fans.

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:22.910
I do the Twitter.

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:24.170
I do it all.

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:25.620
But it is like, oh my god.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.265
I mean, if somebody had told
me this like, years ago,

00:28:28.265 --> 00:28:30.140
that this was what it
was going to evolve to,

00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:31.040
I mean, I don't know.

00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.915
I don't know if I would've
signed up exactly.

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:38.270
I mean Jane gets stopped.

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:39.740
You get stopped
way more than I do.

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.052
And you handle it so well.

00:28:41.052 --> 00:28:42.010
JANE LYNCH: No I don't.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:42.630
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah you do.

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:43.755
JANE LYNCH: Not these days.

00:28:43.755 --> 00:28:46.020
I can be really rude these
day.s you've seen it.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:46.960
But yeah.

00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.240
KATE FLANNERY: But sometimes
enough is enough though.

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.210
JANE LYNCH: If it's
a child I'll be nice.

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:49.710
Yeah.

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.138
KATE FLANNERY: Yes.

00:28:51.138 --> 00:28:52.440
KEVIN VALK: What if it's an
adult acting like a child?

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.065
JANE LYNCH: But even
they're pushing it

00:28:54.065 --> 00:28:55.514
at this point, the kids.

00:28:55.514 --> 00:28:57.680
KATE FLANNERY: Well, there
is an expectation though.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:58.020
That's the problem.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.728
JANE LYNCH: Yes, there
is an expectation.

00:28:59.728 --> 00:29:03.110
It's almost like you're a prize.

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.780
You're the thing they're
going to put on their shelf.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.585
And I don't like that.

00:29:07.585 --> 00:29:10.210
I'll be walking down the street
and someone just comes right up

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:13.120
to me and goes, in my face.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.420
Not even like, hey.

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:17.160
First of all, I wouldn't
want to talk to you anyway.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.410
Probably wouldn't have
been nice to you anyway.

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:21.920
But it's just this
trying to get a prize.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.560
This isn't it all
what you asked, is it?

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:25.976
KEVIN VALK: No,
that was my fault.

00:29:25.976 --> 00:29:26.322
AUDIENCE: Absolutely.

00:29:26.322 --> 00:29:28.550
I think it's absolutely
related because I actually

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:30.210
saw a production in
Pasadena Playhouse

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:32.210
with Laurence Fishburne.

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:34.240
And he walked on stage
and everybody burst

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.960
into applause in the
middle of the scene

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.760
and interrupted the play.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:38.110
That had to hold for applause.

00:29:38.110 --> 00:29:39.818
JANE LYNCH: That
happens on Broadway too.

00:29:39.818 --> 00:29:43.950
That is kind of a
tradition, actually.

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:47.595
When the star comes
out, they used to do it

00:29:47.595 --> 00:29:48.662
with Lunt and Fontanne.

00:29:48.662 --> 00:29:50.870
They would come out and
everybody would applaud them.

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:54.100
But now it's become kind of
like, you were in a movie!

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.402
Woo!

00:29:56.402 --> 00:29:58.980
Matrix!

00:29:58.980 --> 00:29:59.720
Yeah, that is.

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.270
And it does.

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:01.886
It does take away from it.

00:30:01.886 --> 00:30:02.690
Yeah, it does.

00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:05.650
No, that's one of the
things that I don't like.

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:07.310
But it's been around
for a long time.

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:08.030
I don't know if that
makes it better.

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:09.690
Because it's been
around for a long time.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:11.050
KEVIN VALK: I think the
alternative is I mean,

00:30:11.050 --> 00:30:12.860
you guys have the show that's
going around the country

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.620
and you're able to actually
engage people and be like, I'm

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:15.572
going to be in your town.

00:30:15.572 --> 00:30:15.930
JANE LYNCH: Yeah.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:17.770
KATE FLANNERY: It's
is kind of great.

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:19.400
Although sometimes it feels
like this is your life.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.149
Because there's somebody
that will show up

00:30:21.149 --> 00:30:23.710
that I was like, oh, my old
roommate from 15 years ago

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:24.950
that I've lost touch with.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:25.590
Probably for a good reason.

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:26.554
You know what I mean?

00:30:26.554 --> 00:30:28.460
Like, it's funky.

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.374
But it's also fantastic
in a good way.

00:30:31.374 --> 00:30:32.290
KEVIN VALK: Very cool.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:40.710
JANE LYNCH: More questions about
how hard it is to be a star.

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:43.519
KEVIN VALK: How much they
hate this generation.

00:30:43.519 --> 00:30:46.060
AUDIENCE: First of all, thanks
to both of you for coming here

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.460
to come speak with us today.

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.120
I'm was just
wondering, what's it

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:53.070
like when you, either of you,
when you run into Second City

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:54.090
alums?

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:55.590
Like you're doing
a show or a movie.

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:56.640
Like, for example,
I know both of you

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.520
have worked with Steve
Carell on things.

00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:01.210
You know, "40-year-old
Virgin" and "The Office".

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:03.690
So hoping you'd speak
a little on that.

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:05.380
JANE LYNCH: It's
wonderful because we

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:09.250
have a shared history
that they were definitely

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:10.770
the salad days for us.

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.830
But they were really
creative times.

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:14.310
Chicago's a really
wonderful place

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:17.500
to start your artistic career.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.006
It's full of people who are
self starters who are doing it

00:31:20.006 --> 00:31:20.880
because they love it.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.992
And it attracts people from
all over the world, really, who

00:31:23.992 --> 00:31:25.950
kind of want to start
their own theater company

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:29.890
and want to work on stage and
love it for the art of it.

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:32.850
And so it's kind of nice
to run into somebody

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:34.830
like, hey, remember back then?

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:36.914
And the wardrobe person
on "Glee" used to say I

00:31:36.914 --> 00:31:38.330
could always tell
a Chicago actor.

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:41.167
They hang up their clothes.

00:31:41.167 --> 00:31:43.000
Because we hang up our
clothes because we're

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.125
going to have to wear them
the next day and there's

00:31:45.125 --> 00:31:46.580
nobody cleaning them for us.

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:51.820
But there's just yeah, it's
kind of artistic centric.

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:55.650
And so when you run into each
other it's almost like a relief

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:57.940
like, oh, you know,
there's somebody

00:31:57.940 --> 00:31:59.260
who I used to make funny with.

00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:01.840
And we used to go out
drinking and have parties.

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.395
So it's kind of nice to connect.

00:32:03.395 --> 00:32:04.520
KATE FLANNERY: It is great.

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.420
And the other thing
I was going to say,

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.757
the whole award show phenomenon,
that is so fantastic.

00:32:08.757 --> 00:32:11.090
Because there's people that
I would see from Second City

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:13.490
that I'd only see at the
Emmys or at the Golden Globes.

00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:14.656
And it'd be like, oh my god.

00:32:14.656 --> 00:32:16.190
You know, it's
like, such a weird--

00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:18.530
it's like we're on
this weird planet

00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:22.402
that we're so lucky to get
to, whether we win or not.

00:32:22.402 --> 00:32:23.360
It doesn't even matter.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.684
It's like we're at
this crazy party

00:32:26.684 --> 00:32:28.850
and Tony Bennett is singing
five feet in front of us

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:30.670
for no reason.

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:31.880
So it's this weird thing.

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:38.980
But it's a nice validation for
all the weird-- all the growing

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.170
and the stumbling
and all that stuff.

00:32:41.170 --> 00:32:45.170
It's like, it's just so nice
to get to enjoy those moments

00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:47.790
and to realize like, it
doesn't matter what you get.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:51.160
Just being there is
really the prize.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:51.660
Thanks.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:52.785
JANE LYNCH: You're welcome.

00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:59.030
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:59.030 --> 00:32:59.970
KATE FLANNERY: Hi.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:02.053
AUDIENCE: So I wanted to
say, first off, thank you

00:33:02.053 --> 00:33:06.214
for all the work you do for
PETA and animal protection.

00:33:06.214 --> 00:33:08.030
That's very worthy.

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:09.536
JANE LYNCH: Love the animals.

00:33:09.536 --> 00:33:11.160
AUDIENCE: Are you
going to miss "Glee"?

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.900
And what part of it do you
think you'll miss the most?

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:15.210
If you miss it.

00:33:15.210 --> 00:33:17.410
JANE LYNCH: Yeah.
you know, yeah.

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:20.270
Well, you know, we did
in the Paramount lot.

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:22.350
And I have a new
TV show now on CBS

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:24.600
that's I start shooting soon
called "Angel From Hell".

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.330
And we're shooting
on Paramount lot.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:28.600
And we're not on
the "Glee" stages.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:32.300
But our production offices are
the "Glee" production offices.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.520
So it's kind of funny
to be back there, just

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.560
a different show
and different faces.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:39.740
I became close with Matt
Morrison and Darren Criss.

00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:41.220
And they're both
on Broadway now.

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.360
And I got to see them.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.830
And so there's a part of it
that's like, yeah, it was done.

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:48.830
And I have the
friends, the people who

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:50.370
popped for me are still around.

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.654
So Dot-Marie Jones,
and I still see

00:33:52.654 --> 00:33:53.820
these people which is great.

00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.400
Chris Colfer lives
two blocks from me.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.801
So I see him all the time.

00:33:58.801 --> 00:34:00.300
AUDIENCE: Are you're
going to record

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.840
this particular show at all?

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.274
Or do some form of recording?

00:34:03.274 --> 00:34:03.940
JANE LYNCH: Yes.

00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:05.380
I think we did one.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.840
We recorded the one in
Merrillville, Indiana.

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:11.179
Which is great because
it was all of our peeps.

00:34:11.179 --> 00:34:13.429
Because it's about 20
minutes from Chicago.

00:34:13.429 --> 00:34:14.659
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah, a lot
of your high school friends

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:15.139
were there, right?

00:34:15.139 --> 00:34:15.600
Yeah.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.099
JANE LYNCH: I think--
you know what?

00:34:17.099 --> 00:34:21.681
We might be-- Joe's
Pub we might-- yeah,

00:34:21.681 --> 00:34:22.889
hopefully it'll be something.

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:26.080
I think we might actually do
a production where we do it

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:28.871
on purpose and maybe have a
live feed and an album from it.

00:34:28.871 --> 00:34:30.870
They're kind of talking
about that sort of thing

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:31.994
but nothing's for sure yet.

00:34:31.994 --> 00:34:33.300
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.090
KATE FLANNERY: But
there's nothing better

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:35.261
than coming to the theater.

00:34:35.261 --> 00:34:35.969
JANE LYNCH: Yeah.

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:36.439
It is.

00:34:36.439 --> 00:34:38.369
AUDIENCE: If I were going
to be around absolutely.

00:34:38.369 --> 00:34:38.850
JANE LYNCH: I love it.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:39.920
KATE FLANNERY: Cheap
promotion, sorry.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.350
JANE LYNCH: We're going to be
in Long Beach for all of you

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:43.489
out here, if you wanted
to take a little ride.

00:34:43.489 --> 00:34:43.969
KATE FLANNERY: October 3rd.

00:34:43.969 --> 00:34:45.030
JANE LYNCH: October 3rd.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.750
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah.

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:47.080
JANE LYNCH: Which
will be a great show.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.139
KATE FLANNERY: Go to Jane Lynch
official for all the dates.

00:34:49.139 --> 00:34:50.699
JANE LYNCH: Yes, and I think
it's at The Carpenter Center?

00:34:50.699 --> 00:34:51.980
KATE FLANNERY: The
Carpenter Center, yes.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.820
JANE LYNCH: Richard and
Karen Carpenter actually--

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:54.650
KATE FLANNERY: Oh I'm sorry.

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:55.351
I went to Jesus.

00:34:55.351 --> 00:34:55.850
I'm sorry.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.527
And they are like Jesus.

00:34:59.527 --> 00:35:01.110
JANE LYNCH: The most
famous carpenter.

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:02.466
KATE FLANNERY: Yes, right.

00:35:02.466 --> 00:35:03.980
JANE LYNCH: Next
to Harrison Ford,

00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:04.810
who you know was a carpenter.

00:35:04.810 --> 00:35:06.171
KATE FLANNERY: Oh
I didn't know that.

00:35:06.171 --> 00:35:06.671
Wow.

00:35:06.671 --> 00:35:07.647
That's awesome.

00:35:07.647 --> 00:35:08.480
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.030
JANE LYNCH: You're welcome.

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:10.120
KATE FLANNERY: Thanks.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.430
KEVIN VALK: You both
are phenomenal singers.

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:14.120
And I didn't realize, actually,
you sang until this whole thing

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:14.911
kind of came along.

00:35:14.911 --> 00:35:19.034
And so when you guys
weren't doing the show,

00:35:19.034 --> 00:35:21.450
was there kind of coming back
into practice with all this?

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:23.660
KATE FLANNERY: Well, I actually
have a comedy lounge act.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.580
So I've been singing for
15 years just doing that.

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:26.160
JANE LYNCH: The
Lampshade, it's called.

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.450
KATE FLANNERY: We're
called The Lampshades.

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:28.699
we're like a dying lounge act.

00:35:28.699 --> 00:35:30.470
We do mash ups of
'70s and '80s songs.

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.740
KEVIN VALK: Right.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:33.115
KATE FLANNERY: But my partner
Lampshades, Scott Robinson,

00:35:33.115 --> 00:35:34.610
does not sing harmony.

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:36.230
So the reason why
we do mash ups is

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:38.992
because we can only sing
two songs at the same time.

00:35:38.992 --> 00:35:39.950
That's like, our trick.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:40.360
JANE LYNCH: But that's great.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.820
KATE FLANNERY: It's like, our
weakness became our strength.

00:35:42.820 --> 00:35:43.512
If that makes any sense.

00:35:43.512 --> 00:35:44.530
KEVIN VALK: Yeah, yeah yeah.

00:35:44.530 --> 00:35:44.950
KATE FLANNERY: So yeah.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:46.741
But that feels different
because it's like,

00:35:46.741 --> 00:35:48.880
it's a little more
of a character.

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:53.182
So I sort of make fun of singers
when I sing as a Lampshade.

00:35:53.182 --> 00:35:55.390
Because it's like, all the
people that are super self

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:58.420
indulgent that kind
of drive me crazy.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.400
But so getting to sing
with Jane is like,

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.784
this very legitimate like, you
either got it or you don't.

00:36:03.784 --> 00:36:05.200
You either get
there or you don't.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.250
JANE LYNCH: And
we've gotten better.

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:06.740
KATE FLANNERY: Oh yeah.

00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:09.323
JANE LYNCH: I mean, we weren't
too shabby when we started out.

00:36:09.323 --> 00:36:11.570
But my voice is better
than it's ever been.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:12.894
KATE FLANNERY: No, absolutely.

00:36:12.894 --> 00:36:13.810
JANE LYNCH: It's true.

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:14.420
KATE FLANNERY: We
could do Utah again.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.146
You would not need
oxygen. I know that.

00:36:16.146 --> 00:36:16.840
We would be super fine.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:17.930
JANE LYNCH: If we
were in Utah today

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:20.190
we would not be sucking
that oxygen off stage.

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:22.231
They literally had a
machine where you could go--

00:36:23.779 --> 00:36:25.070
KATE FLANNERY: It was so funny.

00:36:25.070 --> 00:36:27.350
I remember the first time
we did the show in New York.

00:36:27.350 --> 00:36:31.300
And you said, you're
as good as me!

00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:32.900
That is high praise baby.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.275
JANE LYNCH: We
had just rehearsed

00:36:34.275 --> 00:36:36.240
and, oh, I was so
pleased with us.

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:38.573
KATE FLANNERY: Well, no,
because you don't give it away.

00:36:38.573 --> 00:36:40.860
I mean, you don't-- you
know, she's not full of shit.

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:43.900
If you get a compliment
it's genuine.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.610
She's not emailing it in.

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:47.590
JANE LYNCH: You're
as good as me.

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:49.910
How's that for a compliment?

00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:51.804
I knew she would get it though.

00:36:51.804 --> 00:36:53.220
KEVIN VALK: I know
you guys packed

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.120
the show with a ton of songs.

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.560
But are there any songs that you
would like to get into the show

00:36:56.560 --> 00:36:58.018
that you didn't
get in, you're kind

00:36:58.018 --> 00:36:59.180
of this well-oiled machine?

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.471
JANE LYNCH: If we find a song
that we want to get in we

00:37:01.471 --> 00:37:02.230
will put it in.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.510
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah.

00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.740
JANE LYNCH: Yeah.

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:02.810
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah.

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:03.310
I think so.

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:05.090
I mean, we talked about
doing some Roches songs,

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:05.870
which we might.

00:37:05.870 --> 00:37:06.580
JANE LYNCH: Well, we
could still do that.

00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:07.000
KATE FLANNERY: Maybe Christmas.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.470
JANE LYNCH: You know the Roches?

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:09.747
Y'all should check them out.

00:37:09.747 --> 00:37:11.330
They're three sisters
from New Jersey.

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:12.746
And they were
popular in the '70s.

00:37:12.746 --> 00:37:15.140
And they do these crazy
three-part harmonies,

00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:16.382
but hilarious lyrics.

00:37:16.382 --> 00:37:17.840
KATE FLANNERY: A
lot of a cappella.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:19.173
JANE LYNCH: A lot of a cappella.

00:37:19.173 --> 00:37:20.720
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah, so good.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:21.690
JANE LYNCH: Some of the
songs are hilarious.

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:23.530
And some of them
were very moving.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:25.290
So we will look into that maybe.

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:26.920
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah, there
might be some Christmas material

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:27.419
perhaps?

00:37:27.419 --> 00:37:30.530
JANE LYNCH: Oh, perhaps we
might do a very crazy version

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:31.700
of the Hallelujah Chorus.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:32.770
KATE FLANNERY: Oh yeah.

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:35.270
JANE LYNCH: It'll be legit, the
actual parts and everything.

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:36.900
But we'll do it really fast.

00:37:36.900 --> 00:37:37.615
Right?

00:37:37.615 --> 00:37:38.740
KATE FLANNERY: No pressure.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:39.230
JANE LYNCH: No pressure.

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:40.100
KATE FLANNERY: No pressure.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:40.430
No rehearsal.

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:40.590
No pressure, yeah.

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:43.400
JANE LYNCH: That's probably
going to happen in December.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.874
KEVIN VALK: And it would
be awkward in March.

00:37:45.874 --> 00:37:47.640
JANE LYNCH: No, well
actually, that's

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:50.680
when he is risen,
according to the timeline

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.230
of this whole thing.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:53.920
Hallelujah Chorus
is he has risen.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:54.880
And we do at Christmas.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.310
And it's just the
timeline's off.

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:58.150
KATE FLANNERY: It's
an Easter song.

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.530
I'm going to talk to
the new pope about that.

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:02.480
JANE LYNCH: Yeah, right.

00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:04.730
KEVIN VALK: So looking back
at your guys careers, what

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:06.750
were just, like, the most
memorable times and the most

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:07.630
fun times in your career?

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:09.129
I mean obviously,
you guys are on TV

00:38:09.129 --> 00:38:12.157
and have so much success in
the past couple decades here.

00:38:12.157 --> 00:38:14.490
JANE LYNCH: It's funny, music
is in every memory for me.

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:15.350
That's the best.

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:18.289
When we did a Mighty Wind,
rehearsing a Mighty Wind,

00:38:18.289 --> 00:38:20.330
the music, because we
didn't rehearse the acting.

00:38:20.330 --> 00:38:22.880
Because there was no rehearsal
for Christopher Guest movies.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.004
But we rehearsed the music.

00:38:24.004 --> 00:38:25.520
And then we went on tour.

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.135
And that was so much fun.

00:38:28.135 --> 00:38:29.010
That was a highlight.

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:32.550
And you know, this,
what we're doing now.

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:34.890
And "The Real Live Brady
Bunch" was a lot of fun too.

00:38:34.890 --> 00:38:37.159
But yeah, mostly
it's the-- god, those

00:38:37.159 --> 00:38:39.200
were the heady days. "The
Real Live Brady Bunch",

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:40.329
that was so much fun.

00:38:40.329 --> 00:38:42.370
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah, that
was like such a journey

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:43.830
for all of us involved.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:45.240
Like, we were learning so much.

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.990
And there was such a
sense of possibility.

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:49.950
Jill Soloway was our director
and her sister Faith.

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:53.700
And it was like,
there was a sense--

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.860
she was-- Jill was totally
fearless even back then.

00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:57.100
JANE LYNCH: Yeah, Jill
created "Transparent".

00:38:57.100 --> 00:38:58.100
KATE FLANNERY: Fearless.

00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:01.600
JANE LYNCH: And is the
executive producer on that.

00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.600
She was like, 27 years old.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.337
And she's dealing
with these guys

00:39:05.337 --> 00:39:07.170
in New York, these
theater guys in New York,

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:08.280
getting us a great deal.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.820
We did it at the Village Gate.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:10.110
KATE FLANNERY: Amazing.

00:39:10.110 --> 00:39:11.520
JANE LYNCH: Yeah,
she was fearless.

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.853
KATE FLANNERY: Great negotiator.

00:39:12.853 --> 00:39:14.910
But really great
creative person.

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:15.910
She had it all.

00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:19.194
And like, in some ways I'm so
surprised it took her 20 years

00:39:19.194 --> 00:39:20.360
for "Transparent" to happen.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.140
Because I would have
assumed it would

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.280
have happened 20 years ago.

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.510
JANE LYNCH: She was
no slouch before that.

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.660
KATE FLANNERY: No.

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:24.430
No.

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:26.600
But it's even sweeter
because yeah, I mean, yeah.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.850
JANE LYNCH: This is her story.

00:39:27.850 --> 00:39:31.020
You know, her dad really,
at the 70 decided he was

00:39:31.020 --> 00:39:33.712
a woman, kind of out of nowhere.

00:39:33.712 --> 00:39:35.170
KATE FLANNERY: So
it's interesting.

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:37.964
So we've had like, well, that's
another shared that we have.

00:39:37.964 --> 00:39:39.630
Like, this kind of
experience of someone

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:44.580
who kind of shepherded all
of us to kind of take it

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.660
to another level and
to realize that we

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:49.770
could reach a new dream, like
a different-- our own kind

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:50.270
of dream.

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:52.942
Like, really follow
our own personal bliss,

00:39:52.942 --> 00:39:53.650
which is unusual.

00:39:53.650 --> 00:39:55.310
Because usually, when
you go to theater school,

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.059
sometimes there's kind
of regimented thing

00:39:57.059 --> 00:39:59.130
that is kind of expected
and go to New York

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:00.120
or do regional theater.

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.480
And you know, and
maybe getting paid shit

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.040
and then getting paid great
for doing what you really

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:08.940
love doing is such a rare--
it's like, it's the greatest.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:10.590
I mean, you guys know.

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:11.400
You work at Google.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.065
You must be paid millions.

00:40:12.065 --> 00:40:13.110
JANE LYNCH: Yeah,
you're Googlers.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:13.860
KATE FLANNERY: Right?

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.401
KATE FLANNERY: But
seriously, there's

00:40:15.401 --> 00:40:18.709
something so important
about having that peace.

00:40:18.709 --> 00:40:19.250
I don't know.

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:20.720
I feel so privileged.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.800
And it's always worth the wait.

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.680
I mean, that's why I didn't
mind waiting tables longer.

00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.000
Because everything
was worth the wait.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.650
I don't know, I had some
sense of faith about it.

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:32.500
But I think it came
from Chicago days.

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.410
JANE LYNCH: Yeah, I do too.

00:40:34.410 --> 00:40:36.692
Yeah, keep if fun
or don't do it.

00:40:36.692 --> 00:40:37.525
KATE FLANNERY: Yeah.

00:40:37.525 --> 00:40:39.774
AUDIENCE: Well, thank you
guys for being here so much.

00:40:39.774 --> 00:40:40.588
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:40.588 --> 00:40:43.068
JANE LYNCH: Being here so much?

00:40:43.068 --> 00:40:45.052
Too much?

00:40:45.052 --> 00:40:49.410

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:03.310
And it would be really nice to
get some people in the theatre.

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:03.996
