those were the problems one of the other

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690
those were the problems one of the other

those were the problems one of the other
problems was Barnard already had a real

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119

woman Studies program and we were

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:50.789
woman Studies program and we were

woman Studies program and we were
dependent on it and worked in

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229
dependent on it and worked in
 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.839
dependent on it and worked in
cooperation with it but the Barnett

00:01:53.839 --> 00:01:53.849

so there were a lot of just bureaucratic

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399
so there were a lot of just bureaucratic
 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.890
so there were a lot of just bureaucratic
and structural problems in figuring out

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900
and structural problems in figuring out
 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.520
