I heard about what eita

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320
I heard about what eita
 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.310
I heard about what eita
very early in my childhood from the age

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320
very early in my childhood from the age
 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.770
very early in my childhood from the age
of five onwards so it was one of the

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780
of five onwards so it was one of the
 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.980
of five onwards so it was one of the
earliest things I started to read when I

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990
earliest things I started to read when I
 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.310
earliest things I started to read when I
started to read and it was very much

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320
started to read and it was very much
 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.060
started to read and it was very much
part of my consciousness in the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070
part of my consciousness in the
 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.080
part of my consciousness in the
beginning I saw the Bhagavad Gita's text

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090
beginning I saw the Bhagavad Gita's text
 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.620
beginning I saw the Bhagavad Gita's text
that was very classical much like the

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630
that was very classical much like the
 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.770
that was very classical much like the
Iliad and the Odyssey mythical saga that

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780
Iliad and the Odyssey mythical saga that
 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.010
Iliad and the Odyssey mythical saga that
showed the eternal conflict between good

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020
showed the eternal conflict between good
 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.670
showed the eternal conflict between good
and evil but much later as I grew up I

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680
and evil but much later as I grew up I
 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.619
and evil but much later as I grew up I
realized that it was much more than that

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629
realized that it was much more than that
 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.380
realized that it was much more than that
it was it was an examination of

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
it was it was an examination of
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.610
it was it was an examination of
consciousness and the desire of human

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620
consciousness and the desire of human
 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.439
consciousness and the desire of human
beings of the quest that we have as

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449
beings of the quest that we have as
 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.069
beings of the quest that we have as
human beings to understand ourselves

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079
human beings to understand ourselves
 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.619
human beings to understand ourselves
that it was the map you might say for

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629
that it was the map you might say for
 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.630
that it was the map you might say for
exploring the territory and that leads

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640
exploring the territory and that leads
 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.800
exploring the territory and that leads
us to find out things about herself who

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
us to find out things about herself who
 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.560
us to find out things about herself who
are we where do we come from was the

are we where do we come from was the
 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.920
are we where do we come from was the
meaning and purpose of our existence do

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
meaning and purpose of our existence do
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.710
meaning and purpose of our existence do
we have a soul what happens to us after

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720
we have a soul what happens to us after
 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.170
we have a soul what happens to us after
we die does God exist does God in fact

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180
we die does God exist does God in fact
 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.280
we die does God exist does God in fact
care about us how can we get in touch

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290
care about us how can we get in touch
 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.310
care about us how can we get in touch
with that source that we call

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320
with that source that we call
 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.679
with that source that we call
consciousness is the consciousness

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689
consciousness is the consciousness
 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.569
consciousness is the consciousness
behind our thoughts also the

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579
behind our thoughts also the
 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.420
behind our thoughts also the
consciousness responsible for all the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430
consciousness responsible for all the
 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.450
consciousness responsible for all the
intelligent activity of the universe the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460
intelligent activity of the universe the
 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.780
intelligent activity of the universe the
bhagavad-gita is actually a very good

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790
bhagavad-gita is actually a very good
 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.679

text for yoga the yoga of love the yoga

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689
text for yoga the yoga of love the yoga
 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.950
text for yoga the yoga of love the yoga
of action or karma the yoga of

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960
of action or karma the yoga of
 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.459
of action or karma the yoga of
understanding or intellect and the yoga

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469
understanding or intellect and the yoga
 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.910
understanding or intellect and the yoga
of reflection and meditation so I think

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
of reflection and meditation so I think
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.100
of reflection and meditation so I think
it's a very important map for

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110
it's a very important map for
 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.240
it's a very important map for
understanding the nature of

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250
understanding the nature of
 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.600
understanding the nature of
consciousness the word yoga is the same

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610
consciousness the word yoga is the same
 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.670
consciousness the word yoga is the same
as the English word yoke

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
as the English word yoke
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.119
as the English word yoke
so in the New Testament when Jesus

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129
so in the New Testament when Jesus
 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.270
so in the New Testament when Jesus
Christ says my yoke is easy and my

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280
Christ says my yoke is easy and my
 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.849
Christ says my yoke is easy and my
burden is light my interpretation is

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859
burden is light my interpretation is
 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.640
burden is light my interpretation is
that he's referring to yoga it means

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650
that he's referring to yoga it means
 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.300
that he's referring to yoga it means
Union union of the body mind and the

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310
Union union of the body mind and the
 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.899
Union union of the body mind and the
spirit as one continuum of consciousness

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909
spirit as one continuum of consciousness
 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:36.679
spirit as one continuum of consciousness
I think about what Gita is about both

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:36.689
I think about what Gita is about both
 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:39.500
I think about what Gita is about both
the forces of light and the forces of

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510
the forces of light and the forces of
 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.759
the forces of light and the forces of
darkness that exists within our own self

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769
darkness that exists within our own self
 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.809
darkness that exists within our own self
within our own soul that our deepest

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819
within our own soul that our deepest
 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.449
within our own soul that our deepest
nature is one of ambiguity we have

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459
nature is one of ambiguity we have
 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.420
nature is one of ambiguity we have
evolutionary forces there

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430
evolutionary forces there
 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.909
evolutionary forces there
forces of creativity and love and

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919
forces of creativity and love and
 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.539
forces of creativity and love and
compassion and understanding but we also

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549
compassion and understanding but we also
 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.879
compassion and understanding but we also
have darkness inside us the diabolical

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889
have darkness inside us the diabolical
 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.690
have darkness inside us the diabolical
forces of separation fear and delusion

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700
forces of separation fear and delusion
 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.000
forces of separation fear and delusion
and in most of our lives there's a

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010
and in most of our lives there's a
 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.909
and in most of our lives there's a
battle going on within ourselves between

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919
battle going on within ourselves between
 

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:16.509
battle going on within ourselves between
the sacred and the profane between the

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519
the sacred and the profane between the
 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.199
the sacred and the profane between the
evolutionary impulses and destructive

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209
evolutionary impulses and destructive
 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.080
evolutionary impulses and destructive
tendencies and that we have between

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090
tendencies and that we have between
 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.680
tendencies and that we have between
creativity on the one hand and addictive

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690
creativity on the one hand and addictive
 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.599
creativity on the one hand and addictive
behavior on the other hand between the

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609
behavior on the other hand between the
 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.869
behavior on the other hand between the
divine and the diabolical between the

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:32.879
divine and the diabolical between the
 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.229
divine and the diabolical between the
light and the shadow between the sacred

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239
light and the shadow between the sacred
 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.319
light and the shadow between the sacred
and the profane so the bhagavad-gita is

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329
and the profane so the bhagavad-gita is
 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.550
and the profane so the bhagavad-gita is
an understanding of this battle that we

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560
an understanding of this battle that we
 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.710
an understanding of this battle that we
have in our consciousness that

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720
have in our consciousness that
 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.640
have in our consciousness that
ultimately is played out in the

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650
ultimately is played out in the
 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.839
ultimately is played out in the
battlefield that we call our physical

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849
battlefield that we call our physical
 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.780
battlefield that we call our physical
bodies in the physical universe so by

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790
bodies in the physical universe so by
 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.879
bodies in the physical universe so by
understanding the dynamics of these

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889
understanding the dynamics of these
 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.550
understanding the dynamics of these
forces within our own consciousness and

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560
forces within our own consciousness and
 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.080
forces within our own consciousness and
by beginning to harmonize our impulses

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090
by beginning to harmonize our impulses
 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.439
by beginning to harmonize our impulses
with the evolutionary impulse within us

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:05.449
with the evolutionary impulse within us
 

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:08.360
with the evolutionary impulse within us
we heal ourselves and in doing so we

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370
we heal ourselves and in doing so we
 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.210
we heal ourselves and in doing so we
heal not only our physical bodies but

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220
heal not only our physical bodies but
 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.420
heal not only our physical bodies but
our world because the world that we find

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430
our world because the world that we find
 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.569
our world because the world that we find
ourselves in is a projection both of our

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579
ourselves in is a projection both of our
 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.180
ourselves in is a projection both of our
personal consciousness and our

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190
personal consciousness and our
 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.760
personal consciousness and our
collective consciousness so I think it's

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770
collective consciousness so I think it's
 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.790
collective consciousness so I think it's
very relevant to modern times when

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800
very relevant to modern times when
 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.740
very relevant to modern times when
see things like global warming and

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750
see things like global warming and
 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.290
see things like global warming and
climate chaos and changing weather

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300
climate chaos and changing weather
 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.779
climate chaos and changing weather
patterns and natural disasters like

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789
patterns and natural disasters like
 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:35.230
patterns and natural disasters like
Hurricane Katrina and extreme poverty

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240
Hurricane Katrina and extreme poverty
 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.990
Hurricane Katrina and extreme poverty
and economic disparities and social

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000
and economic disparities and social
 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.619
and economic disparities and social
injustice and war and terrorism these

00:04:41.619 --> 00:04:41.629
injustice and war and terrorism these
 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:45.040
injustice and war and terrorism these
are the projection of a collective

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050
are the projection of a collective
 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.430
are the projection of a collective
consciousness that's in disarray a very

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440
consciousness that's in disarray a very
 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.260
consciousness that's in disarray a very
collective consciousness where there is

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270
collective consciousness where there is
 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.059
collective consciousness where there is
a rift in the collective soul a

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.069
a rift in the collective soul a
 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:57.670
a rift in the collective soul a
collective consciousness that is

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680
collective consciousness that is
 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.199
collective consciousness that is
evolving but is going through a lot
