PAMELA DAHER: In
October, Geo was

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.920
diagnosed with kidney cancer.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.633
Chemo makes him very
tired, very sick.

00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:12.300
ANDREA COLLITON: James
comes in and he's

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.860
able to work with our kids.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.890
He provides them distraction
from their treatment

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.280
and to really help them
focus on something positive.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.435

00:00:22.435 --> 00:00:24.810
JAMES ORRIGO: We came into
the hospital to work with Geo.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.240
He did a great job explaining
some of his favorite things.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.823
What's something
that makes you happy?

00:00:28.823 --> 00:00:31.020
What's something
that makes you laugh?

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.060
We recorded that and sent that
over to the local high school.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.060
We have, like, a
really special mission.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.820
So what we're going
to need your help with

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.650
is to start drawing
and illustrating

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.220
the audio recording of
things that make Geo happy.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.053

DAVID BRITTAIN:
There are a number

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.770
of schools around the
world who use Concepts.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.920
Our goal is to make it
simple and easy as possible

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.800
to express their ideas visually.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.300
JAMES ORRIGO: And
what's even cooler

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.760
is that we have a whole music
department to create a film

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.660
score.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.160
LAUREN HENDRY
PARSONS: We've created

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.340
a range of tools that empower
people to be able to make music

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.230
and having Chrome OS is a
really important part of that.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.080
We've constantly used
the functionality

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.347
that Chrome gives us.

00:01:13.347 --> 00:01:15.680
JAMES ORRIGO: One of the
coolest things that's happening

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.354
is Geo is actually
coming here today.

00:01:19.354 --> 00:01:21.839

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.150
DAVID BRITTAIN: I never
imagined Concepts would be used

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.275
to cheer up kids in a hospital.

00:01:35.275 --> 00:01:38.460
It pays back all of
those long, hard hours.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.775
It's very moving.

00:01:39.775 --> 00:01:41.400
LAUREN HENDRY PARSONS:
We should always

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.410
be thinking about how
what we're doing every day

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.390
is having a positive
impact on the world.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.740
That's incredibly
humbling and inspiring.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.710
PAMELA DAHER: We're lucky
that it is 90% curable.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.630
Chemo is 31 weeks.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.520
We're currently on week 20.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.500
So we're almost at
the end of the tunnel.
