[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.178 --> 00:00:08.740
JACQUELINE: Well, today
I'm delighted to introduce

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.417
one of Google.org's
newest partners,

00:00:11.417 --> 00:00:13.000
and one of the world's
leading experts

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.160
on opportunity and mobility.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.629
And also a personal
hero of mine.

00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:19.420
My team knows I talk
about him all the time

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.110
as someone who I think is doing
some of the most fantastic work

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.180
globally around inclusion,
future of work inequity.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.510
So we are thrilled
to actually say, just

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.730
today, that Google.org
is going to be providing

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.430
a $250,000 grant to help
support some of the work

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.305
that he is doing around
Opportunity Insights.

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:40.930
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.460
We don't do this with all of
our speakers, just so you know.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.769
But a little background
on Dr. Chetty,

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:49.810
for those who don't know.

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.720
So he's a Professor of
Economics at Harvard University,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.690
and he was awarded a
MacArthur Genius Fellowship,

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.240
and is the winner of the
John Bates Clark medal,

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.440
given to the best American
economist under the age of 40.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.480
Raj's work asks, how
can we give children

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.000
from disadvantaged
backgrounds the best

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.130
chance of economic prosperity?

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.460
And one thing I find very
powerful about his work

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.030
is that he and his team
have also figured out

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.460
how to inject the data--

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.770
and more importantly,
the meaning--

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.140
into the central
narrative of this country.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.980
And so his work has been
popularized, and been written

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.710
about, and is part of
conversations that probably

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.960
all of you are having,
without realizing perhaps

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.540
sometimes his work
is undergirding it.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.940
So, for example, he has found
that the generation born

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.680
in the 80s is the
first in modern history

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.590
to have less than even odds
of outearning their parents.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.260
I won't give away all
of your good stuff.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.610
But a personal favorite of mine,
as the wife of a public school

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.620
teacher, that high-quality
elementary teachers

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.360
generate long term gains
for their students,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.700
including higher college
attendance and larger earnings.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.180
And that in 99% of neighborhoods
in the United States,

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.550
black boys earn
less in adulthood

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.710
than white boys who
grew up in families

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.180
with comparable income--

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.620
99%.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.910
So this kind of work
is shaping not only

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.300
our work in policy in
academia, but the conversations

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.920
around America, and
why it's so important.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.600
So we're really pleased that
Google's own chief economist,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.220
Dr. Hal Varian, is going to
join us and do a fireside chat.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.100
And so we're going to start with
Dr. Chetty coming up and giving

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.470
us some context.

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.890
Then we'll open
up to have a chat,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.680
and there'll be lots of times
for questions from all of you.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.718
So thank you.

00:02:37.718 --> 00:02:40.158
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:42.925 --> 00:02:44.550
RAJ CHETTY: Thanks
so much, Jacqueline,

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.630
for the warm introduction.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.150
And thank you all
for being here.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.540
I really appreciate the
generous support of Google.org.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.881
Looking forward to
partnering with you.

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:55.130
So I'm going to tell you a
little bit today about what

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.590
our research group is focused
on-- broadly on restoring

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.219
the American dream.

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.760
And I'm going to talk about how,
in our own local communities

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.176
and our local
institutions, we can

00:03:03.176 --> 00:03:05.690
make a big difference on
issues like inequality

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.130
and economic opportunity.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.770
But I want to start at a
much bigger picture level,

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.720
by talking about
the American dream.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.660
Which, of course, is a
multifaceted, complicated

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.510
concept that means different
things to different people.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.490
But I want to distill
it to a statistic

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.400
that we can measure
systematically

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.900
in the data, which is a way
that the American dream has been

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.550
traditionally conceptualized.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.820
The idea that through hard
work, any child in America

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.614
should have the
chance of going on

00:03:30.614 --> 00:03:32.780
to have a higher living
standard than their parents,

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.940
or going on to earn
more than their parents.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.520
And so what we're starting
out with in this first chart

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.440
is just an assessment
of whether that's

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.220
true in the United States today,
and how the American dream has

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.340
fared over time.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.150
So what we're doing here is
calculating, very simply,

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.390
the fraction of kids who go on
to earn more than their parents

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.910
did, based on the year
in which they're born.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.040
So as you can see here, for kids
born in the 1940s and 1950s,

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.600
it was a virtual
guarantee that you

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.910
were going to achieve the
American dream of moving up,

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.220
relative to your parents.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.770
92% of kids born in
1940 went on to earn

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.400
more than their parents did.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.220
If you look at what
has happened over time,

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.490
you see a very stark fading
of the American dream.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:15.570
Such that, as
Jacqueline mentioned,

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.649
for kids born in the 1980s,
who are turning 30 today,

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:20.519
when we're measuring
their earnings,

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.834
It's essentially a coin
flip-- a 50-50 shot--

00:04:22.834 --> 00:04:25.250
as to whether you're going to
do better than your parents.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.140
Now this broad
trend, I think, is

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.700
not just of economic interest.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.389
I think it's a fundamental
social and political interest

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:32.930
in the United States,
because I think

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.150
it underlies a lot
of the frustration

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.010
that people around the
US are expressing--

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.280
that the US is no longer a land
of opportunity, as it once was.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.970
So motivated by that trend,
in our research group,

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.360
Opportunity Insights,
based at Harvard,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.700
we're essentially trying
to tackle the big picture

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.340
question of, how can we
restore the American dream?

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.500
What is driving that trend?

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.904
And our approach has, really,
three central elements.

00:04:57.904 --> 00:05:00.320
The first, which will be very
familiar to all of you here,

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.320
is that we try to harness
large data sets, typically

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.380
structured data coming from
government data sources--

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.320
census data, tax data,
things like that--

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.650
in order to study how to
increase upward mobility.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.090
And I think this is
really a special moment

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.610
in social science where, much
as you all are using data

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.090
in your work to improve the
products that people have

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.840
access to, I think our
knowledge of social science

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.840
is going to be revolutionized
by modern big data in the coming

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.160
decades.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.217
Second, we focus greatly,
as Jacqueline mentioned,

00:05:32.217 --> 00:05:34.550
on not just doing this research,
but trying to translate

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.710
that research to policy change.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.230
By trying to inform
public conversations,

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.200
or as I'll give you a couple
of examples of, increasingly

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.900
partnering with local
government agencies, colleges,

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.950
other institutions, to really
create change on the ground.

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.620
The third point,
kind of a departure

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.150
for what I'm going
to show you, is

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.010
that rather than
approaching the data

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.300
at an aggregate
or national level,

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.200
we really try to hone in on
specific geographic areas

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.210
or specific subgroups,
to try to understand

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.980
what the drivers of inequality
and opportunity are.

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.629
And so the starting
point for what

00:06:06.629 --> 00:06:08.420
I'm going to talk about
today is that there

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.320
are very sharp local differences
in rates of upward mobility

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:15.800
that I think should shape how we
think about the broader problem

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.494
of the fading American dream.

00:06:17.494 --> 00:06:19.160
And so I'm going to
start by showing you

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.352
that data with this map here.

00:06:21.352 --> 00:06:23.060
It's just to give you
a bit of background

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.410
before I describe what it shows.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.580
We construct this map using
data following 20 million kids

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:29.840
from birth to adulthood.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.530
That's using anonymized
information from tax returns

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.530
connected to census records,
where we basically tracked

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:38.810
these 20 million kids--
essentially all kids born

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:40.600
in America in the early 1980s--

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.160
follow them to adulthood,
and look at how they ended up

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.610
doing in terms of their earnings
conditional on growing up

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.000
in a low income family.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.570
And so what we're doing in
this map is taking that data

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:54.740
and assigning kids to locations
based on where they grew up.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.980
We divide the US into
740 different metro

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.180
and rural areas.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.950
And in each of those
areas we take the set

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.700
of kids who grew up there in
low income families-- that

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.960
is families of the 25th
percentile of the income

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.410
distribution, earning
about $25,000 a year.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:11.660
We follow those kids
into adulthood and ask,

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.350
how much do the kids who grew
up in each of these places

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.777
earn, on average, in adulthood?

00:07:15.777 --> 00:07:17.360
So think of this as
a way of measuring

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.550
how upward mobility varies
across areas in the United

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.070
States.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:25.010
And so the map is colored
such that blue areas,

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:26.630
like in the center
of the country,

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:29.420
represent areas with higher
levels of upward mobility,

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:32.150
and red colors represent
areas with lower levels

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:33.420
of upward mobility.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.870
So start by just looking at
the scale in the lower right.

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:39.680
You can see that there's a
dramatic range in kids' chances

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.900
of moving up across
the United States,

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.530
depending upon
where they grow up.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.510
In the darkest red
colors, you see

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.660
that kids who grow up in
families earning about $25,000

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:52.792
a year, their own incomes,
on average, are about $27,000

00:07:52.792 --> 00:07:55.000
a year in adulthood-- like
in a place like Charlotte,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.760
North Carolina, for example.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.410
In contrast, if you
look at the center

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.990
of the country, or a place like
Salt Lake City, for instance,

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:06.060
or some areas on the coasts,
you see numbers like 45,000.

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.120
Kids starting out in families
earning $25,000 a year

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.730
are, on average, ending up
earning about $45,000 a year.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:16.080
So there's a very
broad spectrum in terms

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.780
of rates of upward mobility
within the United States.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.290
That aggregate national picture
that I started out with really

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.950
is driven by a great
heterogeneity across areas.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:29.400
Now naturally, the question of
interest to us as academics,

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.220
and to policymakers, is
to ask what is driving

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.809
this variation across areas.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:35.309
And what, ultimately,
might we be

00:08:35.309 --> 00:08:38.789
able to do to increase
upward mobility in places,

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.380
or for subgroups,
where we currently

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:42.720
have less economic opportunity.

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.450
One thing I'd like
to point out on that

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.976
is that one of the first
explanations that might come

00:08:47.976 --> 00:08:49.350
to your mind is
maybe differences

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:51.420
in upward mobility
across places are

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.370
driven by differences
in the types of jobs

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.800
that people have access to,
or things like developments

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.070
in technology, and so forth.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.139
As you can see from this map,
though, that doesn't entirely

00:09:02.139 --> 00:09:03.055
appear to be the case.

00:09:03.055 --> 00:09:03.555
Right?

00:09:03.555 --> 00:09:05.764
So if you take an example
like Charlotte, some of you

00:09:05.764 --> 00:09:07.471
might know that
Charlotte, North Carolina

00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:09.810
is one of the most rapidly
growing cities in the United

00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:10.310
States.

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.450
It's had one of the
highest rates of job growth

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:14.580
over the past 20 or 25 years.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.530
Yet, as you can
see here, Charlotte

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.110
is one of the places in America
with the very lowest levels

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:21.630
of upward mobility, among
big cities, for the kids

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:22.720
who grow up there.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.850
So how does that add up?

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.310
How can you both
have very high job

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.320
and wage growth, and have
very low upward mobility?

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.230
So what's happening in
places like Charlotte,

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:33.840
or Atlanta, or a number of
other high-growth cities

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.300
is that they basically
import talent.

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:38.730
Lots of people move to
Charlotte, move to Atlanta

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.310
to get those high paying jobs,
but they don't necessarily

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:42.030
grow up there.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:46.380
And it's not always the case
that high job growth benefits

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:48.030
the local residents--
something we

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.480
see in many different contexts.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.780
This is one example of that.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:54.690
Now, in this big map,
your eye naturally

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.910
gravitates to the broad
regional variation.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:59.490
Places like the Midwest look
better for upward mobility

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.970
than the southeast, or places
in the industrial Midwest--

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.750
like Cleveland, and so forth.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.300
But what is striking,
and what we've

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.460
been focusing on
more recently in work

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:10.440
that we released a
couple of months ago,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:14.010
is that there's substantial
variation-- not just regionally

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:16.740
across the country,
but even within cities

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.940
at very small geographies.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:21.960
So to illustrate that, I'm
going to turn and flip over

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.720
to this tool that
we've developed, called

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.770
the Opportunity Atlas,
which you can access and--

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:29.820
sorry, if we can just--

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.974
there we go.

00:10:31.974 --> 00:10:34.140
So you can access this you
know freely by just going

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:38.160
to opprotunityatlas.org,
and type in any address--

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:41.340
very much like a Google map--

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.770
and zoom in to any area.

00:10:42.770 --> 00:10:45.300
So I'm starting out with the
map that I just showed you,

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.260
at a national level.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.870
And now I'm going to zoom
in-- given local interest

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:50.970
here-- to the Bay
Area, and show you

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:58.530
the same data now, at a census
tract level in the Bay Area.

00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.780
So census tracts are--

00:11:03.975 --> 00:11:07.370
there's 70,000 census
tracts in the United States,

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:09.840
and each of them have
about 4,000 people.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.520
So to give you a sense
of scale, a place

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.130
like Palo Alto is
itself divided into 17

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:16.570
different neighborhoods, and
what we're showing you here.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.690
So this is a very
fine-grained information.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.550
Same statistic that
I started out with,

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:24.120
take low income kids
growing up in each place,

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.885
and essentially calculate their
average incomes in adulthood.

00:11:26.885 --> 00:11:29.010
There's some statistical
details in the background,

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:32.500
but that that's basically
what we're doing here.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.010
And so the first thing I'd
like you to see on this map

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:36.870
is, if you look at
the Bay Area, you

00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:39.974
see the same spectrum of
colors that I showed you

00:11:39.974 --> 00:11:40.890
at the national level.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:41.100
Right?

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.900
So you can go from
a place that looks

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.267
like Alabama or
Charlotte, in terms

00:11:45.267 --> 00:11:47.100
of rates of upward
mobility, to a place that

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:50.670
looks like Iowa, within a few
miles within the Bay Area.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:53.062
Now some of the
broad patterns here

00:11:53.062 --> 00:11:54.270
will strike you as intuitive.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:57.360
So you see, for instance,
that the peninsula, much

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.970
of San Francisco, has higher
rates of upward mobility

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.670
than parts of the East Bay--
in particular, Oakland.

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:04.260
Right?

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:08.704
But let me now zoom in further
to discuss this variation

00:12:08.704 --> 00:12:09.870
in a little bit more detail.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:12.420
In particular, to the areas
where we have large low income

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:15.420
populations-- in Oakland
and surrounding areas--

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.750
to show you how you can pick
out more granular variation

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:22.720
that I think illustrates some
of what might be going on here.

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.160
So if we look here
in Oakland, you

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.770
see that there's a very
sharp, almost a dividing line

00:12:28.770 --> 00:12:32.430
between Oakland and San Leandro,
where the colors almost trip

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:35.020
discretely from red to blue.

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.070
So part of that is driven
by something Jacqueline

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:40.230
alluded to, which is
racial differences

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:41.337
in economic opportunity.

00:12:41.337 --> 00:12:42.920
So what you can do
with these data is,

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.560
not just look at the
data in aggregate,

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.500
but look at specific subgroups.

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.530
So what I'm going to do
here is click on black,

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:53.300
to subset the data
to black Americans.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:57.070
And you can see that some of
that divide is driven by race.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:12:59.400
But even conditional
on race, there

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.410
are sharp differences
in Oakland,

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:02.970
relative to San Leandro.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:05.850
So one thing I should
note, just as a side note,

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.480
as you pointed out, even
within a given area,

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.960
there are really
sharp differences

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.600
in rates of upward mobility
between blacks and whites--

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:16.050
and in particular, between
black men and white men.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:18.690
If you look at black
women versus white women,

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.860
you see very similar outcomes.

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.760
But in particular, for men, race
plays an extremely important

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:24.930
role.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:27.750
And so it's important
to see that even when

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.964
you focus on the
black population,

00:13:29.964 --> 00:13:32.130
there's still this substantial
variation across very

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:33.420
nearby neighborhoods.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.880
Now if I look
specifically at black men,

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:38.015
where you see some of the
most striking patterns,

00:13:38.015 --> 00:13:38.890
as I was just saying.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:41.265
And I'm going to look at black
men growing up in the very

00:13:41.265 --> 00:13:43.020
lowest income families.

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:45.570
You see that there are certain
places here, for instance,

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:48.960
let me click this tract,
which is a neighborhood called

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.150
Fruitvale, in Oakland.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.070
And you see some really
striking, I think,

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.020
disturbing statistics
about the United States.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.880
So here you see that for black
men growing up in low income

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.420
families in Fruitvale, their
average income in adulthood

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.411
is $5,600.

00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:05.910
Right?

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.784
And importantly here,
one thing I should note

00:14:07.784 --> 00:14:10.080
is we're tracking these
men, no matter where

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.216
they live in adulthood.

00:14:11.216 --> 00:14:13.090
So these are people who
grew up in Fruitvale.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:14.730
They might not be
living there now.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:16.410
Might be somewhere
completely different.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:18.660
But among the set of
people who grew up there,

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:21.090
they have an average
income of just $5,600.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:22.590
So how is that possible?

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:24.480
The way you get such
a low average income

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:28.000
is by having lots of people
who are not working at all.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.110
And in particular, what you
can do with these types of data

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.880
is look, not just
add income, but look

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:33.980
at a variety of outcomes.

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.890
So if I click over here now to
look at incarceration rates,

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:40.240
you see a really
striking statistic,

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.520
which is that 43% of the
black men who grew up

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.500
in this particular
neighborhood are

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.900
incarcerated on a single day--

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.350
on the date of the 2010 census.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.929
So if you think
about lifetime odds

00:14:53.929 --> 00:14:56.220
of being incarcerated, growing
up in that neighborhood,

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.280
it's going to look like 60%,
70%, something like that.

00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:03.360
Which is how you end up with
an average earnings of $5,600.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.020
Right?

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.470
So the point here is that
there's this incredibly

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:08.670
granular variation.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:11.040
At some level you might
react to that by saying,

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.290
I'm shocked by the
magnitudes, that we

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.134
see such adverse
outcomes, but maybe I

00:15:16.134 --> 00:15:18.300
had some sense that there
were parts of Oakland that

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:19.590
are really tough places--

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:21.300
high poverty, high crime--

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.500
so qualitatively maybe I'm not
so surprised by that picture.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.080
But what I think is perhaps
much more surprising is,

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:33.180
you can go to places that are
just a few miles south, like

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:37.410
down here in San Leandro, where
you have rates of incarceration

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:39.150
that are dramatically lower--

00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:43.940
5% or 1%-- compared to the 40%
that we were seeing in Oakland.

00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:44.440
Right?

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.200
And so the point I'm
trying to make here

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.370
is that when we think
about economic opportunity

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:52.680
in America, really,
we should be thinking

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.630
at a much more local scale.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:57.564
It's not even about the Bay
Area versus other cities.

00:15:57.564 --> 00:15:58.980
It's actually
within the Bay Area,

00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.480
and within a few
neighborhoods that

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.340
are within a couple of
miles of each other,

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.500
that you see extremely
different outcomes for kids.

00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:08.010
And so understanding what's
driving that variation,

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.800
in our view, can
potentially provide a path

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.370
to figuring out how you increase
opportunity more broadly.

00:16:14.370 --> 00:16:17.190
So let me now,
with that example,

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:23.340
come back here and walk you
through some further analysis

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.440
we've done to try to
understand what's driving

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.060
that very local variation.

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:29.550
And ultimately, what we might
be able to do from a policy

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.550
perspective to change
outcomes in the red colored

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:33.940
parts of the map.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.660
So the variation that I
was showing you in Oakland

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.034
occurs not just there,
but in many other cities.

00:16:39.034 --> 00:16:40.950
And I'm going to focus
on a different example,

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:44.284
here in Seattle, where
we're doing a bunch of work.

00:16:44.284 --> 00:16:46.200
Where this is showing
you the same kind of map

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.090
of upward mobility
in Seattle, you

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:51.390
see a similar pattern of a
very broad spectrum of colors,

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:55.140
going from red and the center of
the city to much greener colors

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.350
in places like Normandy
Park, south of the city.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.600
All right?

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.230
So what is driving this
variation across places?

00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:07.950
Why does upward mobility
differ so much across areas?

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.240
So I'm going to show you a
couple of results on that.

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.849
The first point
I want to make is

00:17:11.849 --> 00:17:13.950
that most of the variation
in upward mobility

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:15.780
that we're seeing
across these areas

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.450
is caused by differences
in childhood environment.

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.460
So there are really
two key words there.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.815
The first is the word caused.

00:17:22.815 --> 00:17:24.690
As many of you might
know, in social science,

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:26.220
traditionally it's
very difficult

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.980
to distinguish correlation
from causation.

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:32.040
But my view is, with
the availability

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:34.260
of these large data
sets, as I'll show you,

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.922
we can make great strides
in distinguishing causation

00:17:36.922 --> 00:17:37.630
from correlation.

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:39.301
And I'll illustrate
that in a second.

00:17:39.301 --> 00:17:40.800
We think we're
actually able to show

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.675
that this is about the
causal effect of where

00:17:42.675 --> 00:17:43.780
you're growing up.

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:45.820
Second, it's about
childhood environment,

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:50.390
and not about labor markets
or conditions in adulthood.

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:52.510
So the way we establish
those findings

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:55.690
is by studying seven
million families that

00:17:55.690 --> 00:18:00.010
move across areas, and these
data that we're working with.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.140
Rather than getting into
the statistical details

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.690
of that study, I'm going
to summarize what we find

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:06.830
with a very simple example.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.010
Let's imagine a set of families
that move from the Central

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:12.640
District, which, as
we saw in the map

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.070
that I just showed you of
Seattle, kids who grew up there

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:16.870
from birth, they
have average earnings

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.387
and adulthood of $26,000 a year.

00:18:19.387 --> 00:18:21.970
And take a set of families that
move from the Central District

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:25.240
to Normandy Park, which was in
a much bluer color on the map--

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.010
higher rates of upward
mobility for kids

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:28.730
who grew up there from birth.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:30.640
So imagine now, set
of families that move

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.180
between these two places,
with kids of different ages,

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:37.420
starting with families who move
when their child is exactly

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:38.797
two years old.

00:18:38.797 --> 00:18:41.380
So what we do is take those kids
who move when they're exactly

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:45.430
two, track them forward 30
years using the tax data,

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.620
look at how much they're
earning in adulthood.

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.440
And we see that, on
average, these kids who

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:54.910
move at exactly age two are
earning $39,000 when they're

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:56.170
adults, in their mid 30s.

00:18:56.170 --> 00:18:57.340
All right?

00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.010
So that's for the kids who
move when they're exactly two.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:03.190
Now let's repeat that analysis
for kids who move when they're

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.390
three, four, five, and so on.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.090
They make the exact same move.

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:10.240
What you can see is a very
clear declining pattern.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.370
The later you make that move
from the Central District

00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:16.180
to Normandy Park, the
less of a gain you get.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:19.000
And if you move after
you're in your early 20s,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.770
the relationship
is completely flat,

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:22.282
and there's no impact at all.

00:19:22.282 --> 00:19:23.740
So what do you see
from this chart?

00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:27.050
I think there are really
three key takeaways.

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:29.890
The first is that, apparently,
where you grow up really

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:30.760
matters.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.710
Places have a causal effect
on kids' long term outcomes.

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.389
It's not just that
different people

00:19:35.389 --> 00:19:36.430
live in different places.

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:38.440
Apparently, if you
move a given child

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.910
to a place that's
a few miles away,

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.060
you can see very different
life outcomes for that child.

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:45.340
That, I think, is a
very encouraging result

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.771
for trying to tackle
problems like poverty

00:19:47.771 --> 00:19:49.270
and inequality,
which we've all been

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:50.830
concerned about for decades.

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.230
Because it shows that the
answer doesn't necessarily

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:56.470
lie in switching to a completely
different economic structure--

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:59.320
like Scandinavian countries,
or something like that.

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:01.210
Often the answer
can be five miles

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:05.050
down the street, where you see
completely different prospects.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.420
Second, you see that what
really seems to matter here

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:10.701
is childhood environment, rather
than conditions in adulthood.

00:20:10.701 --> 00:20:12.700
So things like jobs and
labor markets, you know,

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.290
obviously they matter.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:17.320
But where you're growing
up, childhood conditions

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:18.700
seemed really central.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.980
And third, you see
that every extra year

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:23.410
of exposure to a better
childhood environment

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:24.830
improves kids' outcomes.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:26.860
It's not just the
very earliest years

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.590
that matter, which is often
emphasized, especially

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:31.450
recently, in policy circles.

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:33.910
But also, if you move to a
better place when you're 10,

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:36.284
instead of you're 20, there's
still a substantial gainful

00:20:36.284 --> 00:20:36.880
to be had.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.280
So environment matters
throughout childhood, not just

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.150
in the very earliest years.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:44.530
So how can you use
these types of data

00:20:44.530 --> 00:20:47.684
to actually create policy change
to increase upward mobility?

00:20:47.684 --> 00:20:49.600
So given what I've just
been showing you here,

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.266
one thought that might
come to your mind

00:20:51.266 --> 00:20:53.470
is, what if we help low
income families move

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:55.506
to better neighborhoods
that we see

00:20:55.506 --> 00:20:57.880
will potentially generate
better outcomes for their kids?

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.950
Now that's not going to
be a scalable solution.

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:02.120
You can't move everyone.

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.750
But it is actually something
practical to think about

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:07.130
on a small scale.

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:09.340
So just to illustrate
how we're translating

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:13.092
some of this research to
policy change, this map--

00:21:13.092 --> 00:21:14.800
we're now showing the
same map, but we're

00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.520
overlaying where families
that receive housing vouchers

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:21.140
in Seattle most commonly live.

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.650
So we spend about
$45 billion a year

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:26.920
in the US on various
affordable housing programs.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.972
And what we see
here is that most

00:21:28.972 --> 00:21:31.180
of those vouchers that people
get from the government

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:34.510
are used to rent housing in
pretty low opportunity areas.

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.310
They're clustered in the red
colored parts of the map.

00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:40.307
So in light of this evidence,
we've been working with

00:21:40.307 --> 00:21:42.640
the Seattle Housing Authority,
and the Housing and Urban

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:45.820
Development Agency in the US,
to develop a pilot program which

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:49.900
we're testing using a RCT-- a
randomized controlled trial--

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.180
where we're helping families
with housing vouchers

00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.880
move to high opportunity
areas by providing them

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:57.255
information, by
recruiting landlords

00:21:57.255 --> 00:21:58.630
to make them more
willing to rent

00:21:58.630 --> 00:22:00.490
their apartments
to these tenants,

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:02.950
and providing
housing broker search

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:06.610
services to help you find units
in these higher opportunity

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:07.990
areas.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.990
And while I don't have
results to show yet,

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:13.950
preliminary signs are this
is working incredibly well.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:17.020
At essentially no incremental
cost to taxpayers,

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:19.870
you can help families access
much higher opportunity

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:22.130
areas where their kids
will do much better.

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:23.950
So this is a
concrete illustration

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:26.470
of how you can take this
type of research and data

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:29.004
and translate it to
change on the ground.

00:22:29.004 --> 00:22:30.670
Now I want to take a
couple more minutes

00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:33.760
to discuss a
different direction.

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.640
So this is, I think,
a solution that's

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.910
relevant for some families.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:40.085
But as I was saying
earlier, it's not scalable.

00:22:40.085 --> 00:22:42.460
You can do this, maybe, for
a couple of million families,

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:44.110
but you can't move everyone.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:48.670
So the deeper question is, how
can you improve upward mobility

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:50.080
in the places that
currently have

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.330
low levels of upward mobility?

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.410
And so that's what
our research agenda

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:57.220
is centrally focused on now,
and in the coming years.

00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.070
As a first step, one useful
way to think about it

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:03.220
is, what are the
characteristics of areas where

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.767
we see high levels of mobility?

00:23:04.767 --> 00:23:06.850
Are there certain common
features of those places?

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:08.200
And the answer is yes.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:11.150
They tend to have four
systematic characteristics.

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:14.740
They tend to have lower poverty
rates, more stable family

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:18.640
structures-- so a larger
share of two parent families.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:22.190
They tend to have higher
levels of social capital--

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:24.520
so think of the old adage
that it takes a village

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.780
to raise a child.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.520
Places with a lot
of social capital,

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.190
for instance, Salt Lake
City with the Mormon church,

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:33.117
those types of places tend to
have high levels of mobility.

00:23:33.117 --> 00:23:35.200
And then finally, as you
might expect intuitively,

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.640
places with better schools--

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.100
both at the K through 12 level,
and access to high quality

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:41.170
higher education-- tend
to have higher levels

00:23:41.170 --> 00:23:41.990
of upward mobility.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:46.720
So this gives you some sense
of the types of areas I

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.580
think we should be focusing on.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:50.740
It doesn't necessarily
tell you, though,

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.710
what exact interventions you
should implement in order

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:56.120
to increase economic
opportunity.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.590
And so the direction that we're
headed in is partnering with

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.680
many cities across
America-- in this case,

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.610
I'm giving you an
example from Charlotte--

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.970
where we're using this
Opportunity Atlas data

00:24:06.970 --> 00:24:09.490
to ask what types
of programs, what's

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:11.570
going on in neighborhoods
in your city

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:13.330
where we're seeing
much better outcomes?

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.460
Can we then learn something
about interventions

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:18.369
that might work, by
testing new things,

00:24:18.369 --> 00:24:20.410
or looking at historical
data about interventions

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:23.530
that have been attempted and
looking at the outcomes that

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:24.660
have emerged?

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:28.330
OK, so let me wrap
up, since I want

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:30.690
to make sure we have time
to get to your questions,

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:34.790
by just making one
final point here.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:37.120
Which is, usually we
think about issues

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.060
of equality of opportunity from
the perspective of principles

00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:40.660
of justice.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.570
Everyone should have a
shot at the American dream,

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.730
no matter what
their background is.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:47.920
But improving opportunities
for upward mobility,

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.545
I think it's important
to keep in mind,

00:24:49.545 --> 00:24:53.060
can also be important simply
for increasing economic growth.

00:24:53.060 --> 00:24:54.780
And so to illustrate
that, I want

00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:57.220
to show you one
final piece of data

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.147
which focuses on a specific
pathway to upward mobility

00:25:00.147 --> 00:25:02.230
that's very relevant here
in Silicon Valley, which

00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:03.245
is innovation.

00:25:03.245 --> 00:25:04.870
And so to do that,
we're going to study

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:08.230
the lives of 750,000
patent holders in the US

00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:11.680
by linking the universe of
patent records to the tax data

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.370
that we used in the previous
studies that I described.

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:18.610
So I'll start out with this
chart here, which shows you,

00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:21.190
in some sense, your probability
of becoming an inventor,

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:22.530
using patents as a proxy.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.000
I recognize that has
some limitations.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.210
But plotting your probability
of having a patent in your mid

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:30.880
30s-- by the time
you're 35, or so--

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.930
versus your parents' income.

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:34.480
And you can see
that if you happen

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:37.960
to be born to parents in the top
1% of the income distribution,

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.986
you're about 10 times as likely
to go on to become an inventor

00:25:40.986 --> 00:25:43.360
as if you happened to be born
to parents below the median

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.980
of the income distribution.

00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:49.150
Now, one potential explanation
for why you see this big gap

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:51.200
is that this is about
differences in environment,

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.200
and resources, and schools--
the types of things

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.820
I've been talking about here.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:56.560
A different explanation
is that this is

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.000
about differences in ability.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.569
Perhaps the kids born to parents
at the top 1% of the income

00:26:00.569 --> 00:26:02.110
distribution-- you
know, your parents

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:04.362
had to be pretty talented
in order to get there.

00:26:04.362 --> 00:26:06.820
There's genetic transmission
of ability across generations,

00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:09.580
maybe that's why you're more
likely to become an inventor.

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.160
One way to distinguish
between those two explanations

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:16.600
is to use data on test scores
early in childhood as a way

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:20.980
to get a rough sense of whether
aptitude seems to matter here.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.450
And so this chart--

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:25.630
same y-axis, we're
plotting pattern rates--

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:29.290
but now versus your third
grade and math test scores,

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.910
as opposed to your
parents' income.

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:33.550
And so you can see
here that if you

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.670
happen to be at the top of
your third grade math class

00:26:36.670 --> 00:26:39.850
you're much more likely to go on
to have a patent than if you're

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.380
below something like
the 90th percentile.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.040
Now, more interesting for
what I'm talking about here

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:48.190
is, if you then split
that out, looking

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:51.310
at kids from high income
families in the green--

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.200
families in the top 20%--

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.810
versus low and middle
income families in the gray,

00:26:55.810 --> 00:26:57.940
you see a striking pattern.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:00.460
Which is that high scoring
children are much more

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.740
likely to become
inventors if they're

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:03.880
from high income families.

00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.140
If you're from a
low income family

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:07.348
and you're at the top of
your third grade math class,

00:27:07.348 --> 00:27:09.010
it doesn't do a
whole lot in terms

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:11.590
of your odds of
becoming an inventor.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:14.230
So to put it differently,
apparently, in America,

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.970
in order to become an inventor
you seem to need two things.

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:19.180
You need have high
quantitative aptitude,

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.400
as measured by your
third grade math test,

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.410
and you need to be from
a high income family.

00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:26.200
And so you can see why,
from that perspective,

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.880
increasing equality
of opportunity

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.460
could potentially be of
benefit to all of us.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:32.890
Bringing these talented
kids through the pipeline

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:35.470
wouldn't just benefit
them but would potentially

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.120
benefit all of us by increasing
the amount of innovation.

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.510
And so let me end
by just quantifying

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.480
the magnitude of that.

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:45.090
If women, minorities, and
children from low income kids

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:48.162
were to invent as the same
rate as high income white men,

00:27:48.162 --> 00:27:49.620
the data that I've
been showing you

00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:52.560
imply that the patent rate, or
the innovation rate, in America

00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.310
would quadruple.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.860
So there's a tremendous amount
of talent, in some sense,

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.670
being left on the table.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:59.550
And I think figuring
out a way to harness

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.640
that talent would be of
great benefit to those kids,

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.640
and more broadly help us
restore the American dream.

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:06.782
So let me stop there.

00:28:06.782 --> 00:28:07.490
Thanks very much.

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:14.092 --> 00:28:16.050
HAL VARIAN: We'll have
a few questions from me.

00:28:16.050 --> 00:28:19.280
And then I'll turn to Dory,
and turn to the audience

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:23.160
here in the room.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.700
So we've got a lot of
engineers here at Google.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:29.180
And everybody wants to
know what technology did

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.970
you use to build the Atlas--

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:33.110
briefly.

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:35.810
And what was the most
difficult part of it?

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:38.100
What would you like
to see improved?

00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.400
RAJ CHETTY: So we
were most focused

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.840
on the statistical analysis.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:42.020
Right?

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:43.760
So we're doing a bunch
of work internally

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.520
at government agencies,
Census Bureau, tax data,

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.940
just constructing these big
tables that underlie what

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.320
was visualized in those maps.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.890
We then worked with a firm
called Darkhorse Analytics that

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:59.240
does data visualization, that
created the actual interface

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:03.290
building off of a mapbox tool.

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:05.930
And I think the limit
of how much I'll

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:08.810
be able to talk about how that
data visualization happened

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:13.690
is very low, compared to what
all will know about this.

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:18.260
But what would we
like to see improved?

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.480
I mean, I think we've been
encouraged by the fact

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.240
that half a million people
have visited that site,

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.330
and various policymakers
are using it, and so forth.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:29.060
My sense is that
data could be used

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.230
in lots of other applications.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:33.519
So having it pulled
into, you know,

00:29:33.519 --> 00:29:35.060
situations where
people are searching

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:37.310
for housing or other
types of things,

00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:41.409
kind of day to day practice,
would be really useful.

00:29:41.409 --> 00:29:43.700
The other thing I think that
we've struggled with a bit

00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:46.950
is, there's a tremendous
amount of information there.

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:49.130
Lots of different variables,
lots of different ways

00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:50.840
to cut the data, and so forth.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:54.650
So how do you balance presenting
that information in a way that

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:58.160
is comprehensive, yet
is not overwhelming

00:29:58.160 --> 00:29:59.300
for the typical user?

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.966
And, you know, this
is where, of course,

00:30:00.966 --> 00:30:03.500
Google excels, in clear
presentation, things like that.

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.210
I think thinking
about ways to do

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:07.250
that would be really valuable.

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:09.960
HAL VARIAN: One thing we have
announced, a few months ago,

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.200
is this Google Public
Patent Database,

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.180
which actually joins
together all the patent

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:15.140
offices in the world.

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:19.580
So you can look at the US,
China, Japan, and Europe

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:22.490
in a unified way, and do all
sorts of nice cross country

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:24.050
comparisons on the innovation.

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:25.370
RAJ CHETTY: Yup.

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:26.870
HAL VARIAN: But as
I looked at this,

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:32.150
as a data person myself, how do
you get kids' third grade math

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:34.562
scores from 40 years ago?

00:30:34.562 --> 00:30:35.270
RAJ CHETTY: Yeah.

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:35.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:37.680
So I didn't go into
the details there.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.756
HAL VARIAN: And what
was mine, by the way?

00:30:39.756 --> 00:30:41.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:43.490
RAJ CHETTY: So
that specific data

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:47.099
was for all kids who went to
New York City public schools.

00:30:47.099 --> 00:30:48.890
So for a separate
study-- which is actually

00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:50.598
what Jacqueline was
mentioning, you know,

00:30:50.598 --> 00:30:53.300
showing the long-term
impacts of teachers-- the way

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:56.239
we did that study was
by linking data for two

00:30:56.239 --> 00:30:58.280
and a half million kids
who went to New York City

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:03.020
public schools between 1989
and 2009 to the tax data.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:07.100
New York City happened to
maintain on tapes, et cetera,

00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:09.945
information on kids test
scores going way back.

00:31:09.945 --> 00:31:10.890
We got that digitized.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:14.725
It was a whole process to link
everything, as you can imagine.

00:31:14.725 --> 00:31:16.850
But, you know, that shows
you the potential of what

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:18.308
you can do, I think
especially when

00:31:18.308 --> 00:31:20.840
you combine these
different data sets.

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.200
HAL VARIAN: I just read a paper
a few days ago by Stephen Rose,

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.670
who's at the Urban Institute.

00:31:25.670 --> 00:31:28.880
And it's a meta study of
looking at different measures

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.420
of inequality.

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.330
So, for example,
Piketty and Saez--

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:34.420
who I know you know well--

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.880
found that between '79 and
2002 medium income growth

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.610
declined by 8%.

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:44.540
But then they came back
and visited it this year--

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.820
Piketty, Saez, and
Zucman showed a gain

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.880
in real median
income of 33% when

00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:54.110
you account for taxes,
transfers, price index

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:56.480
choices, and household size.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:00.020
And this is similar to many
other findings, of course,

00:32:00.020 --> 00:32:05.600
the Congressional Budget
Office and other groups

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.630
have studied this, and so
much depends on what exactly

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:12.419
goes into this estimate
of household income.

00:32:12.419 --> 00:32:14.210
So I think that figures
you were showing us

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:16.940
were all numbers without
including transfers, right?

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:18.440
RAJ CHETTY: Yes,
straight earnings.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.981
HAL VARIAN: What's
your view on this?

00:32:19.981 --> 00:32:23.990
How should you account for the
existing transfer programs?

00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:26.720
How should you account for
changes in real income?

00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:30.650
Household composition
is another biggie.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:33.000
I'd be very interested hear
what you had to say on that.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.850
RAJ CHETTY: So my general
view on questions like that,

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:36.475
Hal-- you know, issues
of measurement--

00:32:36.475 --> 00:32:38.129
is it really depends
upon what question

00:32:38.129 --> 00:32:39.170
you're seeking to answer.

00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:39.670
Right?

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:41.739
So there's no globally
correct measure.

00:32:41.739 --> 00:32:44.030
It depends upon what question
you're seeking to answer.

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:47.810
So in this context, the
fading American dream,

00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:51.590
we chose to measure earnings
in our baseline analysis

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:54.620
at a pre-tax earnings
level, rather than including

00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:56.540
taxes and transfers.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:58.680
The reason we did
that is, we felt

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.680
the notion of the American
dream, at some level,

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.790
was the idea of being able to
do better than your parents,

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:06.620
in terms of your own
earnings, perhaps,

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:09.179
rather than getting transfers
from the government.

00:33:09.179 --> 00:33:11.220
Of course, you could define
it in different ways,

00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.540
and then the appropriate
statistic would differ.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.220
I think one thing
that's clear, regardless

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:20.300
of the 8% decline
or 33% increase,

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:23.660
is that there's been
much, much larger gains

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.947
at the top of the distribution
than in the middle

00:33:25.947 --> 00:33:26.780
of the distribution.

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:27.280
Right?

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.530
No doubt, even 33%
pales in comparison,

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:33.830
relative to the gains
that people in the top 1%

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:36.530
or the top 5% of the
distribution have experienced.

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:38.210
And that, I think,
is very important,

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:41.930
and connects to what I was
showing you at the beginning,

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:44.390
on the fading American dream.

00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.850
The fundamental
driver of why you only

00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:49.490
have 50% of kids doing better
than their parents today,

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:53.150
as opposed to 90% for kids
born in the '40s and '50s,

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:56.510
is that the way in which
economic growth is now

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:59.240
distributed is extremely
different from the way

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.610
economic growth was
distributed in the past.

00:34:01.610 --> 00:34:04.520
So growth rates, as you know,
are a little bit lower today

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.920
than they were in
the 1950s and 1960s.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:12.227
But we show in that paper that
if you had the same growth

00:34:12.227 --> 00:34:14.810
rates that you had in the past--
high growth rates like we had

00:34:14.810 --> 00:34:16.280
in the '50s and '60s--

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:20.810
but divided that growth in the
way that it's shared today,

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:24.469
across the income distribution,
you would stem only one third

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:27.069
of the decline in the
fraction of kids doing better

00:34:27.069 --> 00:34:27.860
than their parents.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.949
Most of the decline
is due to the fact

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:33.320
that median wages,
however you measure it,

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:37.984
have largely stagnated
relative to growth at the top.

00:34:37.984 --> 00:34:39.650
HAL VARIAN: So there's
this other side--

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:42.290
your colleague Chad Jones has
written a very interesting

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:46.429
paper about why we saw such
increases in productivity

00:34:46.429 --> 00:34:48.880
during the '60s and '70s.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.670
And this was-- potentially,
he doesn't establish this,

00:34:52.670 --> 00:34:55.790
but by simulation-- it's
potentially the fact

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:58.030
that lots of barriers
broke down for women

00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:00.140
and for African-Americans,
and they

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:03.260
were able to enter the labor
force, dramatically increasing

00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:04.640
productivity.

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.610
But at the same time, they
were pulled away from the jobs

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.920
as teachers, and librarians, and
other low income service jobs.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.730
So what was an opportunity
for one group of people,

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:15.930
turned out to be a
problem in terms out

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:17.220
as the community they served.

00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:21.860
So you have to balance these two
interests to really understand

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:25.122
what kinds of behaviors
should be improved.

00:35:25.122 --> 00:35:27.330
RAJ CHETTY: And I think
that's very interesting, Hal.

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:29.080
I mean, there might
even be dynamic effects.

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:29.580
Right?

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.910
So if you imagine--

00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:35.120
people have argued that
in the past the quality

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.770
of the teaching
workforce was greater,

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:38.990
because you had many
high-skilled women who would

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:41.780
choose to go into teaching,
whereas now they don't.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:44.870
And that, as you noted, could
have potentially contributed

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:47.120
to greater productivity
in the '50s and '60s.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.690
But when you now think about
the current generation,

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:51.990
and you think about the
long-term impacts of teachers,

00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:55.014
it may actually have adverse
effects on productivity now.

00:35:55.014 --> 00:35:55.680
HAL VARIAN: Yes.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.480
RAJ CHETTY: Yeah.

00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.330
HAL VARIAN: One of the
interesting findings

00:35:59.330 --> 00:36:06.680
that you said, when high income
people move into an area, that

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:08.900
displaces, or
potentially displaces,

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.845
people who are already there.

00:36:10.845 --> 00:36:13.220
On the other hand, there been
other studies from, Moretti

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:16.370
and so on, that show that
when you see high tech,

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:18.640
high paying firms
move into an area,

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:22.860
five new jobs are created
over the course of a decade.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.257
So there's a lot of--

00:36:25.257 --> 00:36:27.590
I suppose I shouldn't call
it trickle down-- but trickle

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:31.560
across where you bring
economic resources in an area,

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:35.212
it tends to impact most
of the participants.

00:36:35.212 --> 00:36:37.170
RAJ CHETTY: So I think
that's absolutely right.

00:36:37.170 --> 00:36:40.130
This is something we're studying
in more detail at the moment.

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:43.830
Basically, what are the effects
of a new company coming in--

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.280
Amazon, of course,
the new headquarters,

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.080
things like that--

00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:51.290
what impact would that
have on the people

00:36:51.290 --> 00:36:52.610
who were already there?

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.667
So the fundamental
advance we're able to make

00:36:54.667 --> 00:36:56.750
with the types of data
I've been showing you today

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:59.190
is that we're able to look
at things longitudinally.

00:36:59.190 --> 00:37:01.820
You're able to track a
given person over time.

00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:02.870
Why is that important?

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.060
You might see that
when a company moves

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:08.780
in, lots of new jobs
are created, et cetera,

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.850
the place starts to look
much richer, in terms

00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:12.050
of the average incomes
of the people who

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:13.220
are there, and so forth.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:15.470
A lot of that could be
driven by migration, right?

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:17.600
Lots of new people
come in, lower income

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.100
people get displaced, the
place looks much better.

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.140
But have you actually improved
the outcomes of the people who

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:22.973
were actually there?

00:37:22.973 --> 00:37:25.730
We actually, I think, do not
really know the answer to that.

00:37:25.730 --> 00:37:27.590
What I've been showing
you here is that,

00:37:27.590 --> 00:37:31.107
at least for the kids
growing up in those places,

00:37:31.107 --> 00:37:32.690
it's not a one to
one thing, that they

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:34.100
capture those benefits.

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:36.764
And that's because there's
so much mobility in the US.

00:37:36.764 --> 00:37:38.180
You know, of course
lots of people

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:40.310
are going to move
to Silicon Valley

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:42.160
to get the great
jobs that are here.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.480
It doesn't necessarily mean that
the kids growing up in San Jose

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.730
are going to directly benefit.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:48.521
And I think we have to
think hard about how

00:37:48.521 --> 00:37:50.150
you make that connection.

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.490
I think companies like
Google can potentially

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:54.990
play a role in that, thinking
beyond attracting the best

00:37:54.990 --> 00:37:55.490
talent.

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:57.950
How do you cultivate
the talent in the areas

00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:59.180
where the company is?

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:02.360
HAL VARIAN: Yeah, and I
think this mobility, which

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.760
you referred to,
geographic mobility

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.604
has really slowed
down significantly

00:38:06.604 --> 00:38:07.520
in the last few years.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.640
It's much harder, much
more expensive, much rarer

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.690
to see lower income people
moving into high income areas,

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:15.530
because, of course,
they can't afford them.

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:16.613
RAJ CHETTY: Too expensive.

00:38:16.613 --> 00:38:17.410
HAL VARIAN: Yeah.

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:21.670
On this social responsibility,
when Google was, of course,

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:25.330
opening a lot of offices
in areas around the US,

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:26.320
what do you think--

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.330
what would you
recommend or suggest

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:33.220
that we could do to
help be a positive force

00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:35.170
in the local communities
in those areas?

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:38.230
RAJ CHETTY: I mean, I
think one thing we find--

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:40.660
so let's go back to the
inventors data for a minute.

00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:42.340
So one of the
interesting patterns,

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:44.560
which I didn't
discuss, is if you

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:48.370
ask, what is driving these sharp
differences in innovation rates

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:51.340
across low and high income
families, a lot of it

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:53.230
seems to be about exposure.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:55.490
So let me give you
the following example.

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:58.120
If we take two kids who
currently live in Boston,

00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.920
and let's say they're at MIT.

00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:02.530
And one of those kids
grew up in Silicon Valley,

00:39:02.530 --> 00:39:04.250
and one of those kids
grew up, let's say,

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:06.670
in Minneapolis, which has
a lot of medical device

00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:08.020
manufacturers.

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:10.450
We see that the kid who
grew up in Minneapolis

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:12.070
is much more likely
to go on to have

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:14.112
a patent in medical devices.

00:39:14.112 --> 00:39:15.820
And the kid who grew
up in Silicon Valley

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.550
is much more likely to go
on to patent in computers.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:22.540
More generally, the chances
that you become an inventor,

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:24.070
and the field in
which you innovate,

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:27.340
are greatly influenced by the
area in which you grow up,

00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.290
and the the environment
in which you grew up.

00:39:29.290 --> 00:39:31.340
And that operates in
very specific ways.

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.310
So when women grow
up in areas where

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:36.520
there are a lot of female
inventors in a given field,

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:39.250
they're much more likely to go
on to innovate in that field.

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:41.480
But if there are more male
inventors in that field,

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:44.620
it has no impact at all on
women's innovation rates.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.330
And so all of that,
to me, suggests

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:48.950
that what matters is exposure.

00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:51.130
And so if you think about
a company like Google

00:39:51.130 --> 00:39:53.590
going into a new area,
of course there's

00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:55.510
going to be a lot of
attraction of top talent

00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:56.884
from other places.

00:39:56.884 --> 00:39:58.300
But thinking about
how you develop

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:01.480
programs so that you
connect with the kids

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.439
in local schools--

00:40:03.439 --> 00:40:05.230
you know, you might
have mentoring programs

00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:08.140
or other things that provide
that sort of exposure

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:09.130
in a scalable way--

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:12.430
I actually think, designed
properly and tested carefully

00:40:12.430 --> 00:40:14.080
with these types
of data, could have

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.270
quite a substantial impact.

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:18.500
HAL VARIAN: And we have done
some programs like that.

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.980
I was talking,
actually, at my bank,

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.780
and the teller said,
oh my gosh, my kid's

00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:25.210
taking your computer
course from Google.

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:29.140
I never even knew there was
one, but we've been doing it

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.024
for several years.

00:40:30.024 --> 00:40:31.690
RAJ CHETTY: Maybe
evaluating the impacts

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:33.190
of those things, figuring
out how to scale them,

00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:34.315
would be quite interesting.

00:40:34.315 --> 00:40:36.500
HAL VARIAN: Yeah, that can
have a really big impact,

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.650
I think, from Saturday
morning programs,

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:40.770
after school
programs, and so on.

00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:42.520
One thing that we've
been looking at a lot

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.890
lately is future work issues.

00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:49.060
And as you know, there's a
lot of issues about changing

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:51.100
demographics, and
composition of work,

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:54.370
what kind of job opportunities
are going to be available.

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:57.040
Has any of your work shed
light on some of those issues?

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:01.095
Or is that something
that's for the future?

00:41:01.095 --> 00:41:02.470
RAJ CHETTY: Let
me say two things

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:04.470
on that-- one that relates
to our work, and just

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:05.680
a broader reaction.

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:08.290
So one of the things
we find in our work

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:11.840
is, what seems to predict
longer term success,

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.690
especially in the
current economy,

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:16.130
is not just technical skills.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:19.150
I gave you an example with
math test scores, for instance.

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:22.060
But more broadly, if you look
at so-called non cognitive

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:22.670
skills--

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:24.820
so, measures of social
skills, how well do you

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.640
get along with others,
discipline, and so forth--

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.440
those are actually
more predictive

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:31.810
in the general
population of longer term

00:41:31.810 --> 00:41:34.487
success than technical skills.

00:41:34.487 --> 00:41:36.820
And I think that's going to
be especially relevant going

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:39.280
forward, as man
is, in some sense

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.760
competing with the machine,
it's in the more social kind

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:45.580
of nebulous dimension--

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.920
interacting with
people, and so forth--

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:51.460
where I think there are
big returns to be had.

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:53.320
And so figuring
out how you provide

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:57.040
those skills, in addition to
technical skills-- or some work

00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:59.920
showing that it's really the
combination of those two things

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.850
that's critical for
success in the long run.

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:03.820
So I think thinking
about how we--

00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:06.730
education is not typically
structured with that in mind.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:08.230
Traditional systems
of education are

00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:10.396
about teaching a certain
set of technical knowledge.

00:42:10.396 --> 00:42:12.070
I think figuring
out how we adapt

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:14.390
to that is very important.

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:16.540
My broader reaction
is, people, I think,

00:42:16.540 --> 00:42:18.610
are rightly concerned
about the future of work.

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:22.150
But I would note that
100 years ago, people

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:24.770
were also extremely concerned
about the future of work,

00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:26.560
and thought that
once we had cars

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.710
and all these other machines
there'd be nothing to do.

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:31.780
And I think humans
are inventive people,

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.700
and we will figure
out other things

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:36.085
to do as the economy evolves.

00:42:36.085 --> 00:42:39.280
HAL VARIAN: Yeah, another
important point is that

00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:43.420
the economic dynacism we saw
in the '60s and '70s from

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:46.750
the entry of men and women
into the labor force--

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:51.100
baby boomers and women who
were busy being able to take up

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:55.390
opportunities outside
the traditional jobs--

00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:56.870
that's all running
in reverse now.

00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:59.140
The baby boomers are
retiring, and women's

00:42:59.140 --> 00:43:01.990
participation the labor force
has leveled out, or even

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:03.740
gone down a little bit.

00:43:03.740 --> 00:43:06.600
So what we're
seeing is a society,

00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:08.200
in most developed
countries, that's

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.450
really aging very rapidly.

00:43:10.450 --> 00:43:14.390
And you'd expect to see
maybe less dynamic behavior.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:16.805
Might see less support for
education, for example,

00:43:16.805 --> 00:43:19.250
from that political change.

00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:21.070
RAJ CHETTY: Possibly, possibly.

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:24.080
HAL VARIAN: And there are
big changes, geographically,

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.650
between what's happening,
let's say in Utah and Nevada,

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:28.680
and what's happening in
Wisconsin and Michigan.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:29.638
RAJ CHETTY: Absolutely.

00:43:29.638 --> 00:43:31.359
HAL VARIAN: So quite
interesting areas.

00:43:31.359 --> 00:43:33.650
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much for
sharing beautiful insights

00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:35.060
based on the data.

00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:39.080
You talked about red
pockets in blue areas,

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.700
like the Central
District in Seattle,

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:43.580
or Oakland in California.

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:48.180
What does the picture look
like in the Carolinas, Georgia,

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:50.930
Alabama that are largely red?

00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:54.650
What's the notion of moving
to a better neighborhood

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:56.012
five miles down the road?

00:43:56.012 --> 00:43:56.970
RAJ CHETTY: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:56.970 --> 00:43:58.345
AUDIENCE: What
does it look like?

00:43:58.345 --> 00:43:59.510
RAJ CHETTY: Good question.

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:01.400
I could show you a map,
or you could look yourself

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.524
by going to this website,
at a place like Charlotte

00:44:03.524 --> 00:44:04.370
or Atlanta.

00:44:04.370 --> 00:44:06.770
And you would see very much
the same picture, actually,

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:07.830
that I showed you in Seattle.

00:44:07.830 --> 00:44:09.788
Which is what I think is
the encouraging thing.

00:44:09.788 --> 00:44:12.050
So when we've done
this work, kind

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:15.230
of zooming in over time to
narrower geographies as we've

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:16.580
had better data.

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:19.790
So we put out a study
comparing, basically,

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:23.510
cities at the metro area
level about four years ago,

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:26.570
and Charlotte was ranked
50th out of 50 in that list.

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:29.390
And they were both
unhappy about that,

00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:32.130
but also motivated to try
to do something about it.

00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.014
But at that point,
all we could say

00:44:34.014 --> 00:44:36.180
is, Salt Lake City looks
much better than Charlotte.

00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:37.850
Which was kind of
interesting, but what do you

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:38.660
do about that, right?

00:44:38.660 --> 00:44:41.118
What's more interesting, I
think now, in what we've put out

00:44:41.118 --> 00:44:43.550
a couple months ago, is
that you see that even

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:46.730
within Charlotte, there are lots
of places that actually look

00:44:46.730 --> 00:44:51.710
like the best places in
Seattle, or Iowa, et cetera,

00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:53.490
even within Charlotte itself.

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:55.665
So it's not entirely
a sea of red.

00:44:55.665 --> 00:44:57.290
And I think that's
extremely important,

00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:58.956
because it shows
people in Charlotte you

00:44:58.956 --> 00:45:01.520
can look within your
community to figure out

00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.770
how you potentially expand
those opportunities elsewhere.

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:06.710
HAL VARIAN: What about
the Dory question here,

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:10.850
on who becomes an
inventor in America?

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:12.770
This company's
demographic disparity--

00:45:12.770 --> 00:45:14.240
what would you
recommend to bridge

00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:17.960
this gap between the
socioeconomic issues

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:22.229
that impact innovation and
what we're trying to do here?

00:45:22.229 --> 00:45:24.020
RAJ CHETTY: I mean, I
think it comes back--

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:26.270
some of it can be done at
the level of a company.

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:28.187
I think some of it comes
back to social issues

00:45:28.187 --> 00:45:30.561
that the government and the
broader public has to tackle.

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:31.130
Right?

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:33.500
So what I will say--

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.260
looking at this question on
disparities in demographics,

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:39.050
one thing that comes to mind
is, if you don't do anything,

00:45:39.050 --> 00:45:41.870
these things are changing,
but at an extremely slow rate.

00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:44.840
So we see, for instance, if
you look at gender disparities

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:49.640
in innovation, 14% of patents
in the US currently go to women,

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:52.160
and that's changing at a rate
of a quarter of a percentage

00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.510
point per year.

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:55.760
It's increasing at a rate
of a quarter of a percentage

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.280
point per year, so if
you just do the math,

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.180
that means it's going
to take another 140

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:02.535
years to reach gender parity at
the current rate of progress.

00:46:02.535 --> 00:46:03.500
Right?

00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:07.751
So the question is, how
do you accelerate that?

00:46:07.751 --> 00:46:10.250
At some level I feel like it's
kind of a chicken and the egg

00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:14.810
problem, where if there were
more women in innovation

00:46:14.810 --> 00:46:16.520
in companies like
Google, I think

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:20.250
more girls would be inspired
to pursue those careers.

00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:23.030
So the question is how you
get that cycle started.

00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:25.596
I think some of it comes back
to some of the broader factors

00:46:25.596 --> 00:46:27.470
that I was talking about
on other dimensions,

00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:29.180
thinking about
racial disparities,

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:31.730
socioeconomic
disparities, schools,

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:34.100
the segregation in
our neighborhoods,

00:46:34.100 --> 00:46:36.870
the lack of contact between
low and high income people,

00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:37.770
things like that.

00:46:37.770 --> 00:46:39.644
HAL VARIAN: I would be
very interested to see

00:46:39.644 --> 00:46:43.550
what happens to schools
in New York, where

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:44.702
Amazon is moving in.

00:46:44.702 --> 00:46:45.410
RAJ CHETTY: Yeah.

00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:46.550
HAL VARIAN: There'll
be a proliferation

00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:48.145
of private schools, of course.

00:46:48.145 --> 00:46:50.840
There'll be a proliferation
of charter schools.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:53.060
And, of course, the
New York educational

00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:55.370
schools, which are
pretty good compared

00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:58.730
to the national average.

00:46:58.730 --> 00:46:59.900
Question here.

00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:03.422
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks so much
for coming to speak with us.

00:47:03.422 --> 00:47:04.880
One thing that I
thought was really

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:06.680
compelling about your
talk was the focus

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:09.470
on from big data
to hyperlocal data,

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:12.560
and how we can begin
exploring those kinds

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.420
of interesting
topics, to figure out

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:18.620
ways to change our
economic mobility.

00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:21.311
At Google I'm talking strategy
analytics in the human capital

00:47:21.311 --> 00:47:23.060
side, so it's also
interesting from there.

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:25.910
But outside of work I run a
nonprofit called Consult Your

00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:28.060
Community, that helps
college students work

00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:30.870
with small business owners to
kind of focus on this space.

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:33.170
So my question for
both of you is,

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:35.960
what's the role in local
nonprofits and community

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.270
builders in helping
accelerate this change

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:40.354
from a different angle?

00:47:40.354 --> 00:47:42.020
RAJ CHETTY: So I think
local nonprofits,

00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:43.390
as you can see
with these data, I

00:47:43.390 --> 00:47:44.973
think they can play
a huge role, given

00:47:44.973 --> 00:47:48.800
that the scale of the problem
appears to be fairly local.

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.669
What I think would be
really useful to do,

00:47:50.669 --> 00:47:52.460
and what we're trying
to do with our group,

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:54.168
Opportunity Insights,
with these data is,

00:47:54.168 --> 00:47:58.277
connect with lots of nonprofits
like Big Brothers Big Sisters,

00:47:58.277 --> 00:48:00.110
other groups like that
that are doing things

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:04.970
in mentoring or racial issues,
criminal justice, et cetera,

00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:08.150
to try to evaluate more
systematically what

00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:10.290
has the most significant
impacts in the long run.

00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:10.790
Right?

00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:14.030
I feel like there is a bit
of a disconnect between lots

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:17.390
of people who are doing really
good work on the ground, where

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:19.550
they have a sense that
this might be working,

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:21.810
but how do we scale that?

00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:23.960
How do we think about,
in a cost effective way,

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:27.200
which aspects of different
programs are successful?

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:30.140
I think these sorts of data can
be useful in figuring that out.

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:32.015
And there's a disconnect
between those people

00:48:32.015 --> 00:48:33.830
on the ground and
researchers who

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:36.159
may not be as aware of
the various programs

00:48:36.159 --> 00:48:37.700
that people are
trying, and so forth.

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.325
So one of the things
we're trying to do

00:48:39.325 --> 00:48:41.570
is bring those things
together, and hopefully

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:45.170
have more to say about
it in the coming years.

00:48:45.170 --> 00:48:47.930
HAL VARIAN: What about this
question on the correlation

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:50.140
causation issue?

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:51.936
An alternative
hypothesis might be,

00:48:51.936 --> 00:48:53.810
parents who are really
interested in the kids

00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:54.884
might move earlier.

00:48:54.884 --> 00:48:55.550
RAJ CHETTY: Yup.

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:56.780
HAL VARIAN: And by
the way, as you know,

00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:59.090
there are studies of
immigration, where immigrants

00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:01.580
tend to be highly
motivated people who

00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:04.290
make decisions and move.

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:06.800
And is it really the
immigration per se,

00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.175
or is it those characteristics
of being highly motivated?

00:49:09.175 --> 00:49:10.883
RAJ CHETTY: So this
is a great question--

00:49:10.883 --> 00:49:13.250
gets at kind of the heart
of the statistical issues

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:15.270
in the paper.

00:49:15.270 --> 00:49:18.110
This is referring to the graph
I showed where the earlier

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:20.730
you move to Normandy
Park, in that example,

00:49:20.730 --> 00:49:22.400
versus the Central
District, you appear

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.180
to have better
outcomes in adulthood.

00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:26.330
So natural concern
you might have,

00:49:26.330 --> 00:49:28.820
maybe the people who moved
when their kids are younger

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:30.950
are more motivated,
they're more educated,

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:32.826
maybe they're different
in various ways.

00:49:32.826 --> 00:49:34.700
That's why their kids
earn more in adulthood,

00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:36.949
not because they're growing
up in Normandy Park-- that

00:49:36.949 --> 00:49:39.380
would be a natural confound
we would worry about.

00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:42.441
Give you a sense of how we can
deal with that kind of issue.

00:49:42.441 --> 00:49:43.940
So with the amount
of data you have,

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:47.062
you can compare siblings
within the same family.

00:49:47.062 --> 00:49:49.520
So the way we would talk about
that in a regression context

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.970
is put in family fixed effects,
so you're only comparing kids

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:54.560
within the same family.

00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:56.840
And so effectively what
you're doing there is asking,

00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:00.410
suppose I move to Normandy
Park with a six-year-old

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:01.690
and a 12-year-old.

00:50:01.690 --> 00:50:04.170
I now compare their outcomes.

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:07.940
What is remarkable is you get
exactly the same chart back

00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:10.410
if you only rely on
within-family comparisons.

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:12.650
So in other words,
your younger kid

00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:14.900
does better than your
older kid exactly

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:17.610
in proportion to the age
gap between the two kids.

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:20.510
So if you think about,
could it be a confound,

00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:22.102
that eliminates a
lot of possibilities

00:50:22.102 --> 00:50:23.685
that it's about
different families who

00:50:23.685 --> 00:50:27.020
are moving when their kids are
young versus old, et cetera.

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:29.480
And so we do a bunch of other
things along those lines,

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:32.090
including actually studying
a pure randomized experiment

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:34.520
called the moving to
opportunity experiment, where

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:36.731
housing vouchers were
randomly assigned,

00:50:36.731 --> 00:50:38.480
and we show you that
you get this pattern.

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:41.060
So I think we're quite
convinced that this really

00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:42.680
seems to be a causal effect.

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:43.700
HAL VARIAN: Excellent.

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:44.504
Jackie.

00:50:44.504 --> 00:50:45.920
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
I'm wondering what

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.840
you think the role is
of government policy

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:50.834
in creating some of these low
opportunity neighborhoods.

00:50:50.834 --> 00:50:52.250
So for example, a
lot of, I think,

00:50:52.250 --> 00:50:54.560
high concentrated
poverty communities

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.450
are housing projects
where government policy

00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:59.480
requires you not
to have two parents

00:50:59.480 --> 00:51:03.374
and requires there to be this
high percentage of exactly

00:51:03.374 --> 00:51:04.790
the opposite of
all the things you

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:07.950
said are important-- low social
capital, and all of that.

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:14.700
So the role of government
policy and/or market policy--

00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:17.300
for example, redlining districts
and not allowing people to

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:18.542
move to opportunity.

00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:19.250
RAJ CHETTY: Yeah.

00:51:19.250 --> 00:51:21.860
Yeah, I think
government policies--

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:25.700
inadvertently perhaps,
and historically perhaps

00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:26.780
by design--

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.480
have led to tremendous
segregation that have basically

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.550
made it hard for people
to access opportunities.

00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:34.550
Let me give you two
concrete examples of that

00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:35.970
that we are thinking about.

00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:39.380
So as I was saying earlier,
we spend $45 billion a year

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:41.450
on affordable housing in the US.

00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:43.100
You would think the
intention of that

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.440
is to try to provide people
access to housing that will

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:47.450
give them better opportunities.

00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:50.490
In practice, I
think unfortunately,

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:52.070
much of that
expenditure is working

00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:53.460
in the opposite direction.

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:56.336
So I gave you one example with
the housing vouchers, where,

00:51:56.336 --> 00:51:57.710
for whatever
reason, families are

00:51:57.710 --> 00:52:00.620
using these vouchers to live in
pretty low opportunity areas,

00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:04.470
thereby basically exacerbating
the problem of a lack

00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:05.720
of intergenerational mobility.

00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:08.360
A different example of that,
which gets to government policy

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:11.480
design, something called the
Low Income Housing Tax Credit,

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.710
where we spend about
$6 billion a year

00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:17.000
giving developers tax credits
to develop affordable housing.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.680
But the way that
program is structured

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.480
is, we give you
bigger incentives

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:24.320
if you develop housing
in high poverty, what

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:27.450
end up being relatively
low opportunity areas.

00:52:27.450 --> 00:52:30.580
So we're basically
concentrating poverty further.

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:33.530
If you overlay where these
light tech developments are

00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:37.620
on our maps, they're all in
very low opportunity places.

00:52:37.620 --> 00:52:40.760
And so I think that is, unless
you think those developments

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:43.230
are going to change the level
of opportunity in that area--

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:46.230
which is something
one can look into--

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:48.234
you might actually be
exacerbating the problem

00:52:48.234 --> 00:52:49.650
through the design
of that policy.

00:52:49.650 --> 00:52:52.430
Another example which will
be familiar for folks here

00:52:52.430 --> 00:52:56.820
in Silicon Valley is zoning and
the ability to build housing.

00:52:56.820 --> 00:52:57.470
Right?

00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:59.600
So ultimately, you can
move people around,

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.920
but supply is a
fundamental constraint.

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:04.820
Like, if you can't build any
housing in the Silicon Valley

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:06.957
area, that's going
to prevent people

00:53:06.957 --> 00:53:09.290
from being able to live in
places where their kids would

00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:11.370
do very well.

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:13.810
There are serious political
economy problems there,

00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:16.570
where if you already own
a house in Silicon Valley

00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:19.910
you might not want to vote for
more building, and so forth.

00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:22.714
But I think figuring out how
you get around the zoning

00:53:22.714 --> 00:53:24.880
restrictions so you have
more density of development

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:26.460
and more mixed
income communities

00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:30.225
is another area where
one can have huge impact.

00:53:30.225 --> 00:53:31.600
HAL VARIAN: Let
me-- actually, we

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.990
talked about this first
question here already,

00:53:34.990 --> 00:53:36.070
before the meeting.

00:53:36.070 --> 00:53:37.660
But why don't we go to this one?

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:41.800
Susan Popkin's research
suggests adverse effects

00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:44.350
for children due to
the disruption that's

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:46.010
caused by moving.

00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:48.100
RAJ CHETTY: Yeah.

00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:51.610
HAL VARIAN: How do you view that
in terms of this prescription?

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:55.240
RAJ CHETTY: Yeah, so the way
I would think about the moving

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:59.200
idea is not that we're going
to uproot families that

00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:01.364
are happily living
in a place and ask

00:54:01.364 --> 00:54:02.530
them to move somewhere else.

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:04.430
The way this actually
works-- for instance,

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:07.330
the Seattle experiment I
was describing to you--

00:54:07.330 --> 00:54:10.120
is we take a set
of families that

00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:12.640
have come into the
housing authority,

00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:13.950
they're looking to move.

00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:17.590
20% of low income families
move anyway every year.

00:54:17.590 --> 00:54:20.050
And I think about it as kind
of redirecting the flows.

00:54:20.050 --> 00:54:21.010
You've decided to move.

00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:22.470
You're going to move somewhere.

00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:24.220
Let's give you the
information and support

00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:27.130
to potentially move to a place
where your kids will thrive.

00:54:27.130 --> 00:54:29.525
Not let's go find somebody
who doesn't want to move

00:54:29.525 --> 00:54:30.650
and encourage them to move.

00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:32.980
So that's the way I think
about this issue, kind

00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:33.910
of in a narrow sense.

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:37.510
But the broader question is, how
can you revitalize communities?

00:54:37.510 --> 00:54:40.449
Which, of course,
is the big issue.

00:54:40.449 --> 00:54:42.490
And some of it, you might
think about the factors

00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:45.700
that I was describing,
related to changing

00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:48.970
the quality of schools, trying
to have better teachers.

00:54:48.970 --> 00:54:51.220
You think about things like
social capital and family

00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:53.220
structure, those things
might be very important,

00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:54.692
but how do we change them?

00:54:54.692 --> 00:54:56.150
That's a really
difficult question.

00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:58.960
So the best I can say there
is, we are trying to now use

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:01.330
these data to study
various community

00:55:01.330 --> 00:55:04.570
revitalization efforts that have
been conducted over the past 20

00:55:04.570 --> 00:55:07.660
years or so by the government,
by local nonprofits,

00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:09.160
by developers.

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:11.710
We're building a huge
database of all such efforts

00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:13.240
around the United States.

00:55:13.240 --> 00:55:15.840
And then evaluate, with
this longitudinal data,

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:18.340
what are the characteristics
of the things that seem to have

00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:20.037
worked and things that haven't?

00:55:20.037 --> 00:55:22.120
And that's our hope of
getting a scientific answer

00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:23.814
to that question.

00:55:23.814 --> 00:55:24.730
HAL VARIAN: Excellent.

00:55:24.730 --> 00:55:27.550
Well, our time is up, but
thank you so much for coming.

00:55:27.550 --> 00:55:29.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:29.050 --> 00:55:30.600
RAJ CHETTY: Thank you.
