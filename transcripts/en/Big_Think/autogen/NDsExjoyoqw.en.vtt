lot of volatility in its value in part
 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.430
lot of volatility in its value in part
because of some of these controversial

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440
because of some of these controversial
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.529
because of some of these controversial
events and in part because there's been

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539
events and in part because there's been
 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.900
events and in part because there's been
more knowledge of Bitcoin and that has

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910
more knowledge of Bitcoin and that has
 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.939
more knowledge of Bitcoin and that has
spurred more demand that people want to

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949

hold this thing as a currency or perhaps
 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.099
hold this thing as a currency or perhaps
as an investment and the fact is because

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109
as an investment and the fact is because
 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.619
as an investment and the fact is because
it's so volatile and because there's a

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629
it's so volatile and because there's a
 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.780
it's so volatile and because there's a
possibility that many other virtual

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
possibility that many other virtual
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.789
possibility that many other virtual
currencies will enter the market and

currencies will enter the market and
 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.250
currencies will enter the market and
compete with Bitcoin you have to think

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
compete with Bitcoin you have to think
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.590
compete with Bitcoin you have to think
about it perhaps more like an investment

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600
about it perhaps more like an investment
 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.450
about it perhaps more like an investment
as well as a currency than you would

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
as well as a currency than you would

if you hold on to them they lose they
 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.410
if you hold on to them they lose they
lose value relative to inflation as

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420
lose value relative to inflation as
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.560
lose value relative to inflation as
prices go up but it's fairly stable and

prices go up but it's fairly stable and
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.880

you know that you'll be able to use

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890
you know that you'll be able to use

Bitcoin is a little riskier because we

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280
Bitcoin is a little riskier because we
 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.700
Bitcoin is a little riskier because we
don't know exactly what the demand for

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710
don't know exactly what the demand for
 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.109
don't know exactly what the demand for
bitcoins will be in the future and

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119
bitcoins will be in the future and
 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.539
bitcoins will be in the future and
there's the possibility that we will run

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549
there's the possibility that we will run
 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.670
there's the possibility that we will run
out of new bitcoins they're supposed to

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680
out of new bitcoins they're supposed to
 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.219
out of new bitcoins they're supposed to
be a finite number out there if that

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
be a finite number out there if that
 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.560
be a finite number out there if that
number is reached and no more bitcoins

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570
number is reached and no more bitcoins
 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.319
number is reached and no more bitcoins
are created then essentially individuals

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329
are created then essentially individuals
 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.270
are created then essentially individuals
will have the power to make monetary

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280
will have the power to make monetary
 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.969
will have the power to make monetary
policy for the entire Bitcoin market by

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979
policy for the entire Bitcoin market by
 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.609
policy for the entire Bitcoin market by
either hoarding bitcoins to contract the

either hoarding bitcoins to contract the
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.350
either hoarding bitcoins to contract the
money supply or pushing their bitcoins

out into the market to expand it now

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909
out into the market to expand it now
 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.330
out into the market to expand it now
this is something that we rarely see in

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340
this is something that we rarely see in
 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.120
this is something that we rarely see in
regular currency markets because

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130
regular currency markets because
 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.200
regular currency markets because
individuals don't have that much power

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210
individuals don't have that much power
 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.270
individuals don't have that much power
but it is something that could possibly

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280
but it is something that could possibly
 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.700
but it is something that could possibly
happen in the Bitcoin market in the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
happen in the Bitcoin market in the
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.279
happen in the Bitcoin market in the
future now if you're considering buying

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289
future now if you're considering buying
 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.290
future now if you're considering buying
bitcoins I think the right way to think

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300
bitcoins I think the right way to think
 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.670
bitcoins I think the right way to think
about it is something like

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
about it is something like
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.949
about it is something like
investing in fine wines or expensive

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959
investing in fine wines or expensive
 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.959

musical instruments or paintings it's
something that you wouldn't want to do

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040
something that you wouldn't want to do
 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.830
something that you wouldn't want to do
unless you really knew a lot about what

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840
unless you really knew a lot about what
 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.690
unless you really knew a lot about what
was going on in that market and the

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700
was going on in that market and the
 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.459
was going on in that market and the
underlying value of these things and how

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:25.469
underlying value of these things and how
 

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.860
underlying value of these things and how
that it was created so I would say

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870
that it was created so I would say
 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.959
that it was created so I would say
Bitcoin can be a fun experiment it can

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:29.969
Bitcoin can be a fun experiment it can
 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.789
Bitcoin can be a fun experiment it can
be something that you want to invest

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799
be something that you want to invest
 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.550
be something that you want to invest
time in as well as money but perhaps not

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560
time in as well as money but perhaps not
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.349

just for the dilettante especially
 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:37.550
just for the dilettante especially
because there's so much uncertainty

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560
because there's so much uncertainty
 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.510
because there's so much uncertainty
surrounding its value in the future
