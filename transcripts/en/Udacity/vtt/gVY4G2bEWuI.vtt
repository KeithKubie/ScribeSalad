00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So in unit one, we learn about symmetric ciphers.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In unit two, we're going to learn about how to apply symmetric ciphers

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to solve problems.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So for the rest of this course, we are mostly going to view ciphers as black boxes.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
They provide two functions: encrypt and decrypt.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Encrypt takes in the message from some message base

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and produces a cipher text.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And, it also takes in a key from some key space.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Decrypt is the inverse. It takes in a cypher text and a message.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And if it takes in the same key,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
it will produce the same message that we got.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And our correctness property

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
is that the decryption with the same key of a message encrypted with that key

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
gives us the same message.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
For the rest of this unit we are going to assume

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that we have some function that provides encryption and decryption.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
AS is a good choice for most applications.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And we're going to look at how to use these functions to solve problems.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The first thing we're going to look at though is how we actually get this key.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
All of our assumptions about security depend on this key. And we have two key assumptions.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The first is that the "k" is selected randomly, and uniformly.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This means each key is equally likely to be selected,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and there's no predictability about what the key is.The other big assumption about the key

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
is that it can be kept secret.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The adversary can't learn the key.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
But, it can be shared between the two end points.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This is a big challenge. We're not going to look at that yet this unit.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We'll get to that later.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This is the big problem of key distribution

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
which we'll talk about starting in unit 3.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now I want to talk about this first problem though.

00:01:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that we need to select a random key.
