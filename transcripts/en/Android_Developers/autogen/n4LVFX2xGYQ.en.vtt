just a simple insert statement and you

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:50.890
just a simple insert statement and you
 

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.340
just a simple insert statement and you
get back a channel ID like I said

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:53.350
get back a channel ID like I said
 

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:54.750
get back a channel ID like I said
earlier with the internal provider ID

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:54.760
earlier with the internal provider ID
 

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.970
earlier with the internal provider ID
you can use the channel ID and the

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:56.980
you can use the channel ID and the
 

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.829
you can use the channel ID and the
internal provider ID to make sure when

00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839
internal provider ID to make sure when
 

00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:00.240
internal provider ID to make sure when
you synchronize and update your channels

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:00.250
you synchronize and update your channels
 

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:04.220
you synchronize and update your channels
later you'll have all the keys you need

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:04.230
 
 

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.720
 
okay channels like I said they're just a

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:06.730
okay channels like I said they're just a
 

00:11:06.730 --> 00:11:09.300
okay channels like I said they're just a
shell of a row the programs are what

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:09.310
shell of a row the programs are what
 

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.820
shell of a row the programs are what
really matter so let's look an example

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:11.830
really matter so let's look an example
 

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:14.850
really matter so let's look an example
of a program in this program we have a

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:14.860
of a program in this program we have a
 

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.829

screen and if your program has more than

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.010
screen and if your program has more than
 

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:50.070
screen and if your program has more than
one channel it can be in make sure to

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:50.080
one channel it can be in make sure to
 

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.410
one channel it can be in make sure to
add a unique identifier the home screen

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:52.420
add a unique identifier the home screen
 

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:53.940
add a unique identifier the home screen
will look at this identifier and say hey

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:53.950
will look at this identifier and say hey
 

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:55.860
will look at this identifier and say hey
we already know about this program in

lot easier faster and you don't have to
 

00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:39.550
lot easier faster and you don't have to
deal a lot with it so in Android P the

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:39.560
deal a lot with it so in Android P the
 

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.230

whole setup process is a lot more

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.240
whole setup process is a lot more
 

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.620

so iOS devices or maybe a laptop we
improved that a lot it's it's a lot

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:18.200
improved that a lot it's it's a lot
 

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.530
improved that a lot it's it's a lot
faster it's a lot easier and so we

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:20.540
faster it's a lot easier and so we
 

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:23.050
faster it's a lot easier and so we
should get you through setup a lot

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:23.060
should get you through setup a lot
 

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.620
should get you through setup a lot
easier but that's only setting up the
