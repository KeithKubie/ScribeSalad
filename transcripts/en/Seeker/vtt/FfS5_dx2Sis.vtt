00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:04.820
This is a female anglerfish and this is her
mate.

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.100
And these are her other mates.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.829
They are all locked lovers for life because…
well… the males have no choice.

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:20.050
There are several hundred species of anglerfish,
and a some suborders show extreme sexual dimorphism

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:27.439
- meaning females can be up to 60 times longer
and half a million times heavier than males.

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:34.260
Their size difference makes them ideal candidates
for a bizarre phenomenon known as sexual parasitism.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.440
Basically, males need females to survive and
females need males to reproduce.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.210
But in the vast darkness and depths of the
open ocean, finding each other can be an almost

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.040
impossible task.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.430
To stand a chance, male anglerfish need to
use their disproportionally large nostrils

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.030
to track the pheromonal cues of their lady
loves and their complex and well-developed

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.620
eyes, so that they can confirm a female’s
identity.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.820
Females can also flash their bioluminescent
esca or ‘lure,’ to ensure that they attract

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.830
a partner of the same species.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.100
When a male does find a female in the deep
sea, he won’t ever let her go – because

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.370
he can’t.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.120
Some parasitic male anglerfish lack a working
digestive system, so in order to survive they

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.650
need to tap into the resources of female anglerfish.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.110
They do this by fuse-mating aka sexual parasitism.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.530
Males use their specialized hooked teeth to
latch onto the female and then they release

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.230
an enzyme that dissolves the skin between
them.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:47.820
This gives males direct access to the female’s
digestive system for nutrition and her circulatory

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.100
system for gas exchange.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.870
In return, he’ll give her sperm.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.780
But this doesn’t mean the male can get lazy
because his sperm is competing with several

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.800
other males that also call this female home.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.310
At any given time a female can be host up
to eight sperm-donating mates so it’s important

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.509
that they all produce the very best swimmers.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.520
Male anglerfish can live a long happy life…
that is until their sugar momma dies and then

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.920
they’ll follow shortly after, which is,
I guess, romantic, in a dark Shakespearean

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.910
kinda way.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.540
