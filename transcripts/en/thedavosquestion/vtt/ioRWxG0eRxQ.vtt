&gt;&gt;Kofi Annan: Thank you my young friend for
your very good question.

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:09.480
The leaders here are also concerned about
Africa and that's one of the reasons that

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.780
I'm here. And we will talk about development
in Africa, education, health and the question

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.829
of how the economic crisis impacts in Africa,
and what we are going to do to ensure that

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:28.449
the poor people in Africa do not suffer, and
that the development progress that we've made

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:30.329
is sustainable.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:37.680
We are also going to talk about food and agriculture;
how we assure food security for the continent.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.860
So Africa would be very much part of the process
here and I tell you I am here as your ambassador

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.190
so you can relax. Thank you very much.
