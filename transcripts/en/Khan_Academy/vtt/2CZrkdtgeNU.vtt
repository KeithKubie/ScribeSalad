00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.120
Let's say we have two
intersecting lines.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.080
So that's one of the
lines right over there.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.490
And then I have another
line right over here.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.980
So those are my two
intersecting lines.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.240
And let's say we know that
the measure of this angle

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.840
right over here is
equal to 7x plus 182.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.550
And this is being
given in degrees,

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.160
so it's 7x plus 182 degrees.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.090
And we know that the measure
of this angle right over here

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.740
is 9x plus 194 degrees.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.360
So my question to
you is, what is

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.710
the measure of each
of these angles?

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.300
And I encourage you to pause
the video and to think about it.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.050
Well, the thing that
might jump out at you

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.870
is that these two things
are vertical angles.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.880
They're the opposite angles
when we have these intersecting

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.220
lines right over here.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.200
And vertical angles are
equal to each other.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.790
So we know, because these
are vertical angles,

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:08.680
that 9x plus 194 degrees must
be equal to 7x plus 182 degrees.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.080
And now we just
have to solve for x.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.340
So if we want all the x-terms
on the left-hand side,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.237
we could subtract 7x from here.

00:01:15.237 --> 00:01:17.070
We've got to do it to
both sides, of course,

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.832
in order to maintain
the equality.

00:01:18.832 --> 00:01:20.790
And then we could put
all of our constant terms

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.920
on the right-hand side.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.420
So we can subtract
194 from the left.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.610
We have to subtract
194 from the right

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.020
in order to maintain
the inequality.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.830
And on the left, what
we're left with is just 2x.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.220
And on the right, what
we're left with-- let's see.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.710
182 minus 194.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.480
So if it was 194 minus 182,
it would be positive 12.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.024
But now it's going
to be negative 12.

00:01:44.024 --> 00:01:45.940
We're subtracting the
larger from the smaller,

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.420
so it's equal to negative 12.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.970
And then divide both sides by 2.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.632
And we get x is
equal to negative 6.

00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:57.090
And now we can use
that information

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.380
to find out the measure of
either one of these angles,

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.060
which is the same
as the other one.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.260
So we can see here that if we
take 7 times negative 6 plus

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.940
182, so 7 times negative
6 is negative 42,

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.960
plus 182 is going to be
equal to 140 degrees.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.980
And you'll see the
same thing over here.

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:28.600
If we say 9 times negative 6,
which is negative 54, plus 194,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.541
this also equals 140 degrees.
