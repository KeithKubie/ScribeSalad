00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.690
An IDS can also be
deployed in an end host.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:06.757
And such an IDS is a host-based IDS.

00:00:06.757 --> 00:00:10.126
It can use a variety of
data on system activities.

00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:15.250
For example,
most host-paced IDS use ptrace to obtain

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.580
the system calls made by the program to
monitor the behaviors of the program.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.590
System called data is very
useful to security monitoring

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.910
because whenever a program requests
a resource such as memory allocation,

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.340
access to the file system, networks, and

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.890
IO devices, it needs to make a system
call to the operating system

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.950
because the operating system
manages the system resources.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.280
That is, most of the interesting or

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.840
useful activities by program
are carried out through system calls.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.500
For example if the users
browser receives a page with

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.780
a malicious JavaScript that is able to
break the protection in the browser and

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.220
attempts to overwrite
the Windows registry file,

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.390
the IDS will observe a write
system call to the registry file.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.020
And can decide that this is an anomaly.
