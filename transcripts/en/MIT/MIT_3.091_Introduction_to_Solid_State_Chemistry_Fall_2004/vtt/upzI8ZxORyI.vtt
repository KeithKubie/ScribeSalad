00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.630
Wireless Fantasy by Vladimir
Ussachevsky. It's one of the first

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.270
pieces of computer-generated music.
It was done at Columbia University

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:36.900
in 1960. It was commissioned by a
group of fans of Lee de Forest,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.540
and it was in honor of de Forest's
contribution to wireless broadcast.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.180
And one of the first broadcasts de
Forest ever sent over the radio was

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.140
the piece that you are hearing.
It's Parsifal.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.420
It is from the Wagner Opera.
And so what Ussachevsky has done in

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.710
the piece is to process it to make
it sound really distanct as though

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.990
it is coming over a shortwave radio.
And then he has Morse Code, and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.280
there is various Morse Code messages
going through the piece.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.570
Wireless Fantasy, from 1960,
done long-hand, by the way. It was

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.850
really done with Morse Code in a
mainframe computer and giant

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.120
reel-to-reel decks.
Nothing like what you have on your

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.370
desktop today.
OK, so announcements.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.620
Tomorrow will be the exceptional
Thursday, quiz five based on

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.870
homework five.
Last day we talked about the band

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.120
theory of solids.
And, in the band theory,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.370
we were able to distinguish metals
from insulators from semi-conductors.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.620
And you can see up here,
the metal has a very, very tiny

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.870
energy gap between the top of the
filled orbitals and the bottom of

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.840
the unfilled orbitals.
So it is effortless to move the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.530
electron up into this zone and give
it mobility. In an insulator,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.230
there is a substantial energy
required to move from the filled

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.920
orbitals to the unfilled orbitals,
which we neatly refer to as the

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.610
valence band and conduction band.
And, arbitrarily, we have chosen

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.300
three electron volts.
Typically the insulators are up

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:34.266
four, five, six and so
on electron volts.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:23.250
And then there is this class of
material semiconductors for which

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:42.466
the band gap is on the order of
three electron volts.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:31.750
And why is three such a magic
number? Because three electrons

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:51.900
volts is the threshold of visible
light. Materials that have energy

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:40.250
gaps below three electron volts will
respond to visible light,

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:59.533
and we are going to talk about such
matters presently.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:48.750
And just the last point to make is
that the valence band is constructed

00:02:48.750 --> 00:03:08.566
of the splitting of orbitals that
are associated with bonding.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:56.290
Valence band is valence electrons in
bonding orbitals,

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.580
and the conduction band was
generated from antibonding orbitals.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.880
And then we looked at
photoexcitation.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.170
If we have incident photons that
have enough energy to break the bond,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.470
electrons will be promoted up into
the conduction band.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.760
And it is a momentary transit.
And they will subsequently cascade

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.050
back down. And,
when they do so, a photon will be

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.350
reemitted. When the electron
cascades down, a photon

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.750
will be emitted.
And the emission will be pegged at

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.250
the band gap energy.
If we go into hc over lambda,

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.750
lambda becomes a critical value that
is associated with this particular

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.250
material. And so we can plot
percent absorption.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.750
Percent absorption of what?
Percent absorption of incident

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.250
light as a function of the energy of
that incident light.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.750
High wavelength, low energy light
will pass through.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.250
It will be transmitted,
and the material will appear

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.520
transparent.
High energy, that is to say low

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.570
wavelength incident radiation will
have enough energy to promote

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.630
electrons. And so,
therefore, those incident photons

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.680
will be absorbed,
the excess energy will be dissipated

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.730
up here as heat,
and then we will get reemission of

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.780
photons. And so,
over here, the material is an

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.830
absorber. And so we have a sharp
jump here at a critical wavelength

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.890
which we termed the "absorption
edge." And then,

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.940
towards the end of the lecture,
we talked about another type of

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:34.280
excitation. This was
photoexcitation.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:22.150
We are going to talk about thermal
excitation, where the thermal energy

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.300
in the environment is enough to
cause the breaking of the bonds and

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.460
the promotion of the electron from
the valence band to the conduction

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.610
band. But, in this case,
we discovered that pair of carriers

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.760
was generated.
Not a single carrier.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.920
In the case of photoexcitation,
the electron moves up, falls back

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.160
down. Here we have pair excitation.
What happens is this electron is

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.490
permanently sustainably sitting up
in the valence band leaving in its

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.830
place a broken bond which consists
of a single electron and a missing

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.160
electron which is termed a "hole."
It is zero in a land of minus one,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.490
so it appears to be plus one. And
this is minus one in a land of zero,

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.830
so it appears to be minus one. You
see charge conservation.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.160
The population of electrons in the
conduction band due to thermal

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.490
excitation is equal to the
population of holes in the valence

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.830
band. And electrical engineers like
to just refer to the nature of the

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.750
charge, regardless of the carrier.
Whether it is a positive ion or a

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.250
positive hole,
as far as they are concerned it is a

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.750
positive. The electrical engineers
write this relationship n equals p.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.250
The number of negative charges in
the conduction band equals the

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.750
number of positive charges in the
valence band. And then I left you

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.250
with this mystery at the end of the
lecture. I said,

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.750
well, we observe thermal excitation
in semiconductors but the thermal

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.250
energy is roughly related to the
product of the Boltzmann constant

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.250
times the temperature.
And, in electron volts,

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.750
this amounts to about one-fortieth
of an electron volt at room

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.250
temperature. But the band gap
energy in semiconductors is on the

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.750
order of several electron volts.
In the case of silicon, it is 1.

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.250
electron volts. How can we justify
any kind of thermal excitation given

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.750
that the thermal energy is so much
lower than that of the band gap

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:21.070
energy? Well, I have good news.
The answer is that the energy in

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.210
this room is distributed amongst all
of the entities in the room so that

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.350
if you look at the gas,
for example, let's go back to the

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.490
1850s and peer into the mind of
James Clark Maxwell who also gave us

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.640
Maxwell's equations.
He was a polymath like so many of

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.780
the other people that we have been
talking about in 3.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:45.920
91. He didn't just focus on
electromagnetism. He was

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.780
a renaissance scholar.
And one of his areas of interest was

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.360
physical chemistry,
and he studied gases.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.940
He reasoned that the gases have a
distribution of velocities.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.520
All of the gas molecules in this
room are not behaving as though they

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.100
are at room temperature.
A substantial number are,

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.680
and that is how we establish
temperature, but what Maxwell

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.260
reasoned was that some gas molecules
are moving around as though the

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:14.840
temperature of the room is 500
Kelvin, and some are moving around

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.420
as though it is only 100 Kelvin,
but a large number of them are

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:38.040
moving around as though it
is roughly 300 Kelvin.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.500
He gave us a mathematical
formulation of the distribution of

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.000
energies. And then,
about 25 years later,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.500
Boltzmann came along and said I am
going to going to generalize the

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.000
idea. Forget about just gas
molecules and velocity.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.500
Let's talk about all molecules and
say the reason the gas molecules are

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.000
moving mainly at 300 Kelvin and that
some are moving at 500 Kelvin is --

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:52.640
And this was a big leap for
Boltzmann. He said I am going to

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.290
propose that temperature is
distributed as well.

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:59.930
That the reason some gas molecules
are moving as though they have the

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:03.580
velocity of 500 Kelvin is that I am
going to propose that they have the

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.230
energy of 500 Kelvin.
What is local energy?

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.880
That is temperature. Maxwell and
Boltzmann, we put the two of them

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.520
together and we come up with the
notion of a distribution of

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:18.170
temperature, distribution of energy.
And this is what that distribution

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:22.120
looks like.
What we do is we plot the number of

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.370
particles in a particular ensemble
that have a particular energy as a

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:30.620
function of energy.
And then we will normalize it over

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.870
the total number of particles in the
system. Before I do that,

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.120
why don't I just do an analogy?
We had the test a few weeks ago.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.370
Let's do a distribution of grades,
and then we will relate it. For

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.620
example, what I could do is plot
grade on this axis and I could put

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.870
the number of people who have a
particular grade and

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:55.660
then normalize it.
Divide it by the total number of

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.990
students in the class.
If it's a big class, as this one is,

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.330
and we have some kind of reasonable
test, we expect to see this kind of

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.660
a distribution.
A bell-shaped curve.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.990
A Gaussian distribution.
What does this tell us? It tells

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:12.330
us that some people had greater than
the average value.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:15.660
Some people had less than the
average value,

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:36.786
but the average value is given here.
It is a symmetric distribution.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:23.120
And so we can call this the average.
This is the average grade, g with a

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.240
bar over it. And you get the
inflection point here.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:31.370
This is where the second derivative
shifts from positive to negative.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.490
That is how you get the standard
deviation. This is g bar plus

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.620
standard deviation.
This is g bar minus standard

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:43.740
deviation. You can have a lot of
fun with this.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.870
And the area under this line,
if I use normalized values, must

00:09:47.870 --> 00:10:08.073
equal one. Area equals one when I
normalize from zero to infinity.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:56.660
Let's do the same thing here,
only - this is Gaussian. But that's

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:01.330
not the way molecules are
distributed or energies are

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:05.990
distributed in ensemble.
It is asymmetrical. It looks a

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:10.660
little bit like this.
It has a sharp rise and a long

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:15.330
asymptotic tail.
And so the average is not at the

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:33.793
maximum in this case. This
is Maxwell-Boltzmann.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:24.280
We have a distribution of energies.
And the energy average, E with a

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.570
macron over it,
is somewhere a little bit to the

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:32.850
right of the maximum.
And so what I am doing is taking

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:37.140
the energy of a particle,
the number of particles of a given

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:41.420
energy divided by the total number
of particles. Also the area under

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.710
this curve must equal one.
This is the value at T1. And what

00:10:45.710 --> 00:11:05.620
I want to do is focus down here.
Suppose up here this is 1.1 eV.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:54.610
Well, the average value is here.
And I said that this was

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:59.220
one-fortieth of an electron volt.
That is not the problem. The

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:03.840
problem is not that the average is
one-fortieth of an electron volt.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:08.450
The good news is that there is some
tiny fraction of the distribution

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:13.070
that has energy above 1.
eV. If I knew what that fraction

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:17.690
was then I could guess how much I
could expect in the wave

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:22.420
promotion here.
You can see it is non-zero.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:27.280
It is not a sharp cutoff. There is
a tiny value out here.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.140
And the nature of this curve is
that the fraction of the

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:36.990
distribution out here,
if I want to integrate,

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:41.850
say, from 1.1 eV out to infinity,
that is the area under this line,

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:46.710
what am I integrating?
I am integrating the fraction times

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:51.570
dE. This equals e to the minus
energy gap divided by k Boltzmann

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:56.770
temperature, this exponential.
That is what gives us the fraction

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:02.330
underneath this line.
Now let's see what happens when

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:07.880
temperature rises.
When temperature rises this line

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:13.440
shifts to the right.
And, as you would expect,

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:32.413
the average shifts to the right as
well. This now is E average at T2.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:23.760
Let's say I raise the temperature.
Let's look at silicon. Let's say

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.530
T1 is equal to room temperature 300
Kelvin, and T2 will be the melting

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:33.300
point of silicon.
T2 is the melting point of silicon.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:38.070
Not to make liquid silicon. It is
solid silicon at the melting point.

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:42.840
It would be like ice at zero
degrees C. Melting point of silicon

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:47.610
is 1414 degrees C.
Add 273 to it and you get about

00:12:47.610 --> 00:13:06.486
1700 Kelvin. What is the ratio?
T2 to T1 is on the order of about

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
six. This thing shifts by a factor
of six. Let's look at what happens

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000
in here. I am going to blow this up.
What we are really looking at is

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
what's the difference between the
area here at room temperature?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
What we are going to do is not to
scale. Then we are going to look at

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:23.330
the area under the green curve.
And when we use this relationship,

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:29.990
E to the minus energy gap energy
over kT, band gap energy over kT,

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:36.660
we find that the fraction at T2
divided by the fraction at T1 comes

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:43.330
out to be 10 to the 15th.
Changing temperature changes the

00:13:43.330 --> 00:14:01.193
excitation population through the
shift in the high end of the curve.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:55.450
And it is only through that that we
end up seeing decent levels of

00:13:55.450 --> 00:14:00.900
population in the conduction band.
Actually, the number at room

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:06.360
temperature is vanishingly small.
At room temperature the fraction in

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:11.810
the conduction band is about 10 to
the minus 19th.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:17.270
There are so few of them you can
give each of them a name.

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:22.080
There is almost no conduction.
Silicon at room temperature is an

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.240
insulator. If we want to get some
conductivity are we going to heat

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.410
our computers up to such a high
temperature? I don't think so.

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:34.580
We need some other way of
populating the conduction band.

00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.740
And we are going to do one other
mode of promotion.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.910
We've looked at photoexcitation,
thermal excitation, and the third

00:14:42.910 --> 00:15:02.020
mode is chemoexcitation.
What we are going to do is get

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:52.190
carrier injection by introducing
impurities. And I know you are

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:56.990
sitting there thinking he is crazy.
We just spent all of this time and

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:01.790
money making silicon six-nines
purity, and now we are going to

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:06.590
start throwing impurities into it.
Well, there are two kinds of

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:11.390
impurities in this world.
There are good impurities and bad

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:16.190
impurities. The good impurities are
called dopants.

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:34.246
These are the ones that are there
desirably.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:24.870
Dopants are good guys.
And then there are other ones that

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:28.740
are called contaminants,
and these are undesirable impurities.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:32.620
We don't want contaminants.
We are going to look at dopants.

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.490
And this is a really important
lesson right now that I am teaching

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:40.370
you. What I am showing you,
for the first time in 3.091, is how

00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:44.240
we can use chemistry to alter the
performance of a material.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.120
I am going to take plain
high-purity silicon,

00:15:48.120 --> 00:16:06.973
which is an insulator at room
temperature.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:56.300
And, by operating on its chemical
composition, give it properties that

00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.610
it cannot possess otherwise.
This is a paradigm for solid state

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:04.920
chemistry. You want something that
has a higher yield strength?

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:09.230
We will change its composition.
You want something that has a

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:13.530
higher connectivity?
We will change its composition.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:17.840
That is different. This is an
engineered material. And

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:35.413
how is it engineered?
What we are getting is via chemical

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:12.000
change, purposeful chemical change.
We are getting, if you would like,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:20.000
tailored composition to give
targeted properties.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:28.000
And this is what underlies material
science. If you don't see

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000
what you like, make it.
And how do you make it?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
By understanding the relationship
between electronic structure,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
bonding and ultimately properties.
Here is what the gambit is. I am

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
going to talk only about elemental
semiconductors.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
In the case of silicon and
germanium, I am just going to

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
restrict today to silicon and
germanium. That is not such a bad

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
restriction since we are in the
silicon age. All of your micro

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:22.210
devices contain silicon.
This is pretty good.

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:26.640
Here is the gambit. You introduce
aliovalent impurities.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:31.070
What do I mean by aliovalent?
Alio is the same as the Latin world

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:35.490
for alias, other.
We are going to introduce

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:39.920
impurities that have a difference
valence from silicon and germanium.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:44.350
Silicon and germanium are Group IV,
or Group 14 if you want to use IUPAC

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:48.780
notation. What I am going to do is
introduce something else,

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:53.300
and I will give you an example.
And the purpose of introducing

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:57.920
aliovalent impurities is to cause
electron donation or electron

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.530
consumption. And how is that going
to work? Well,

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:07.150
you will see it best in action.
Here is a simple example. Let's

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:11.760
put phosphorus in silicon.
Phosphorus, as you know, is Group

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.380
15 or Group V,
so it has five valence electrons.

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:34.626
And let's first look at the
Cartesian world.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Here is silicon.
It is sp3 hybridized.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And it forms a diamond-like solid.
It is crystalline, it is regular

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000
arrays, silicons at all of the
corners of the tetrahedron,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000
and on and on it goes. I will give
about three of these.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Now what happens if I introduce
phosphorus?

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:55.140
If I introduce phosphorus,
the phosphorus actually goes in and

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:59.280
substitutes for silicon.
The phosphorus substitutes.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.420
It does not go and sit in some void
space. It actually substitutes for

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:07.560
silicon. Now,
if it is going to substitute for

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:11.710
silicon it has to form bonds.
You cannot just sit there. There

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:15.850
is no passive observer here.
If you want to play you have got to

00:19:15.850 --> 00:19:35.233
bond. Phosphorus comes in with five
valence electrons.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
It goes one, two,
three, four. There are four of its

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
valence electrons bonding to the
four adjacent silicons.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000
What happens to the fifth valence
electron of phosphorus?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
There is no empty orbital in which
that fifth electron can sit.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
That fifth electron is sitting here
kind of tapping its foot wondering

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
what it's going to do.
Let's go over to the energy level

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
diagram. Here is the energy level
diagram. This is elemental silicon.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:52.300
Downstairs is valence band.
Upstairs is conduction band.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:56.920
When we put the phosphorus into the
silicon in energy space,

00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:01.530
where is the only place that fifth
electron can go?

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:06.150
There is no room at the inn down
here. All of the valence orbitals

00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:10.760
are filled, so the only place it can
go is up here in the conduction band.

00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:15.380
Here is the electron that came from
phosphorus. It was donated from

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:35.026
phosphorus. We call phosphorus a
donor. This is a donor electron.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
And can you see that every time I
throw a phosphorus in I am going to

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
get an extra electron in the
conduction band?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
If I want to increase the
conductivity of silicon,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
just keep adding phosphorus one for
one. Am I making holes down here?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000
No, I am not breaking any bonds.
In fact, I am forming bonds here.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
There is an extra electron.
Everything is fine.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Now I have got a lever.
I can dial in how much conductivity

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:52.300
I want.
You want to raise the conductivity

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:56.920
to a certain value?
I can tell you how much phosphorus

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:01.530
to add to get to that level of
conductivity. And this electron is

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:06.150
not in a valence band.
It is not bound so it can move.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:10.760
This goes back to Paul Drude.
These electrons are free to roam

00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:15.380
because they are not bound.
I am going to show you something

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:34.693
really cool. How far can that
electron roam? Think about it.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:24.460
Phosphorus is five valent so it has
an extra proton,

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:28.920
too. This phosphorus is a five plus
in a land of four plus.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:33.380
The phosphorus you can think of as
locally plus. And this electron

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:37.840
that did not go into any of the
valence band orbitals,

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:42.300
it is locally minus. Duh,
an electron is locally minus,

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:46.760
that is deep. I have the phosphorus
that is locally plus and I have the

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:51.060
electron that is locally minus.
Do you know of a model that might

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:55.190
describe the motion of an anchored
positive charge with an electron

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:59.330
that is free to roam?
Do you know of a model that might

00:21:59.330 --> 00:22:03.460
talk about such things?
Bohr. Let's do something really

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:07.590
whacked. Suppose we took this
electron and said let's ask the

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:11.730
question, if we applied the Bohr
model to this pair what would we

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.860
come up with? It is going to give
us energies. It is going to give us

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:34.386
radii. It is going to
give us velocities.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:25.830
Do you think there might be a
relationship to velocity and

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:31.660
mobility and conductivity?
Well, let's see where it goes.

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:37.490
What I am going to do is say recall
in atomic hydrogen the ground state

00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:43.330
energy, this is the electron at the
bottom, is minus k,

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:49.160
what we have been calling k,
which has this full-blown formula of

00:22:49.160 --> 00:23:06.986
me to the 4th over eight epsilon
zero squared h squared.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Plug in all the numbers and you get
minus 13.6 electron volts.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Now, let's think about this.
We are going to have to make a few

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
changes. Epsilon zero,
that is the permittivity of vacuum.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000
But if you are an electron, you are
looking down at the phosphorus,

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
it is not just vacuum between you
and the central phosphorus.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:24.570
There is all this stuff.
There are bonds. There is silicon

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:29.140
nuclei. I have got to modify this.
I have got to change this. What I

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.710
am going to do is take epsilon zero,
which is what we have for vacuum,

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:38.280
and I am going to replace it with
epsilon of silicon.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.850
Silicon is the host crystal.
What does this capture? It

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:47.420
captures all the bonds,
all of the silicon, all of the stuff.

00:23:47.420 --> 00:24:06.240
That is the dielectric constant of
the host crystal.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:40.000
And there is one other thing.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
This is some esoteric physics.
I am just going to put it up here

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
without proof.
When you are in this situation,

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000
you don't use the rest mass. There
is an effective mass,

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
and that invokes a slight correction.
The effective mass of the electron

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
at the bottom of the
conduction band.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:24.120
This is a minor correction.
The main correction is getting the

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:28.240
dielectric constant.
The second one is there for

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:32.370
completeness. Some of you are going
to look back fondly at these notes

00:24:32.370 --> 00:24:36.490
and say we got it,
this was good. Otherwise,

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:40.620
you will say Sadoway left out the
effective mass.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:44.740
You cannot say that now.
Here are the values. For silicon

00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.870
the dielectric constant is 11.
and the effective mass at the

00:24:48.870 --> 00:25:08.673
bottom of the conduction band is
one-fifth of the rest mass.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:57.900
I am going to plug these values into
this equation.

00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:02.810
And what this gives me is then that
the ground state energy of the donor

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:07.720
electron is minus K,
as we had before, and it is going to

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:12.630
be multiplied by 0.
on the top, and then I am going to

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:17.540
have an 11.7 squared on the bottom.
And that gives me minus 0.02

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:35.980
electron volts.
Two one-hundredths of electron volt.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:07.500
This quantity has been measured.
The measured value compare with c.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:12.500
. 0.045 eV measured. You might say
that is more than double that.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:17.500
And I will say wait a minute, we
started at 13.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:22.500
and I took it down to 0.
2. And you are telling me but the

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:27.500
real value is 0.
4. And I say you don't appreciate

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:52.720
good work, that is what.
This is fantastic,

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:58.180
with a simple primitive Bohr model
and two minor corrections to zoom

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:03.630
into condensed matter and give this
value. Where is that going to be?

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:09.080
0.02 south of what? It is going to
be here. This is where that lies.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:14.540
This distance here is the 0.02
electron volt difference.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:32.546
You're 0.02 electron volts below
the conduction band.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
You are not down here.
This is valence. You are up top.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
And the electron is sitting in
there because that's the ground

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.000
state. And now you are saying,
well, that is really great, Sadoway.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Now you have an electron sitting in
an orbital. How are you going to

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000
get it up to here?
I have an answer for that.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
But first look at this. I couldn't
resist this derivation.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
I said what about the radius of the
orbit? How far is that electron

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:52.140
away from the phosphorus?
Is it in tight?

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:56.420
Is it moving around like this or is
it way, way out here?

00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:00.710
Doesn't that intrigue you?
It sure intrigues me. Here is what

00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:04.990
I did. I said the r1,
the radius of this ground state was

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:09.280
going to be given by the Bohr radius
times the modified dielectric

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:13.570
constant divided by the modified
mass. And when you plug in the

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:17.850
numbers you get 30 angstroms.
We say I don't know what the

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:37.066
silicon-silicon distance is.
Well, what do you think it is?

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:07.500
You know it has to be on the order
of a couple of angstroms.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:12.500
If you compare that, the
silicon-silicon distance is 2.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:17.500
5 angstroms. This electron is way,
way zooming around. Fantastic what

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:22.500
we have learned here.
Now let's look at this.

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:27.500
We have an electron sitting in this
energy level down below.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:52.540
Now what happens?
How do I get this thing to move out?

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:57.630
What am I going to do to make it
move out? What do I have?

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:02.720
I know that the energy is 0.
2. But how do I compare this energy

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.810
with the thermal energy?
E thermal is on the order of 0.

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:12.900
25, one-fortieth of an eV. The
thermal energy is so high at room

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:30.733
temperature that it is
able to promote these.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:21.330
And, by the way,
if the Bohr model works for ground

00:28:21.330 --> 00:28:24.660
state, what would happen if I were
to blow this up?

00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.990
Can you imagine,
if this is the conduction band,

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:31.320
I get all of the energy levels. I
get the whole Bohr energy state here.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.660
I get ground state n equals two,
n equals three all the way up. And

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.990
now I have enough energy,
from thermal energy, to take all of

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:41.330
these electrons,
because each one of these comes in

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.660
because it is a separate phosphorus
and they are far enough apart,

00:28:44.660 --> 00:29:04.986
they are separate states. All of
these can get promoted.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:52.530
What do we call this action?
If I take a ground state electron

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:57.060
in hydrogen and I get it right out
of all of this set of energy levels,

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:01.590
what do we call that process, we
take that electron and we throw it

00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:06.130
out of the system?
Ionization. That is exactly what

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:10.660
the electrical engineers call this
process. They call the thermal

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:15.190
excitation of the donor electrons
ionization. For all intents and

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:19.730
purposes, because E thermal is on
the order of this E of the donor

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:24.750
electron, we can assume complete --
And I am going to use the electrical

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:30.250
engineering term here because I
think I am still teaching at an

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:35.750
engineering school,
complete ionization of donor

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:41.250
electrons. This is fantastic.
They are all ionized. Now, last

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:46.750
day I said that the total number of
electrons in the conduction band

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:52.250
would equal the number of electrons
from the host silicon due

00:29:52.250 --> 00:30:10.366
to thermal excitation.
Plus it is going to be the number of

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000
electrons from the impurity
phosphorus.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:30:11.140
And we know this requires Eg on the

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:15.420
order of about 1.
eV. So very few of these are

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:19.710
contributed. There is almost no
promotion of electrons from the

00:30:19.710 --> 00:30:38.753
valence band to the conduction band
to leave holes.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:28.180
This is vanishingly small at room
temperature in silicon.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:32.360
Whereas, here, I am going to put in
quotation marks,

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:36.540
the ionization energy is on the
order of the thermal energy,

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:40.720
we get all the electrons from here.
And so in such a material we say

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:44.900
that the electrical properties are
essentially those from

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:49.530
the impurities.
We send this to zero and say that

00:30:49.530 --> 00:30:54.610
such a material exhibits "extrinsic
behavior." Why is it extrinsic?

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:59.690
Because the electrical behavior of
the silicon is governed by the

00:30:59.690 --> 00:31:04.760
impurities that we introduced into
the silicon. Extrinsic behavior.

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:09.840
Or, let's call it dopant. I am
going to use the word dopant and

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:14.920
impurity interchangeably.
It is dopant-dependent. And this,

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:32.506
of course, depends on how much we
put in.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:24.850
But the typical levels that we put
in are great enough that they swamp

00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:29.710
the value that you get from thermal
excitation. In doped silicon,

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:34.560
you neglect thermal excitation and
you calculate the carrier population

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:39.420
in the conduction band based on how
much phosphorus you put in.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:44.280
Every phosphorus gives you a
contribution. And,

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:49.140
just to complete the definition,
the undoped material, that is to say

00:31:49.140 --> 00:32:07.413
highly pure silicon exhibits
intrinsic behavior.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
In other words,
it behaves as pure silicon should

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000
behave. An intrinsic semiconductor
is one that has impurity levels so

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
low that they do not manifest
themselves. An extrinsic

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
semiconductor has impurity levels
high enough that we can perceive the

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
action of those impurity levels.
We can say, in this material, that

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
n that are generated from the
impurity or the dopant are greater

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
by far than the n from the
host material itself.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:33.660
Or, if you like,
the number of electrons from the

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:38.330
dopant are much greater than the
number of electrons from thermal

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:42.990
excitation. It all comes out to say
then that the number of electrons

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:47.660
that are up in the conduction band
are much greater than the number of

00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:51.720
holes in the valence band.
Because, if the impurity levels are

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.160
dominating what comes out of the
host, then that means if there is

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:58.610
hardly any of the electrons that
came from thermal excitation there

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:02.050
are hardly any holes.
Now the number of electrons far

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:05.490
exceeds the number of holes,
so this material is not net neutral.

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:08.940
We do not say that n equals p
because the number of electrons in

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:12.380
the conduction band is far greater
than the number of holes.

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:15.830
And so we call this material,
it is extrinsic, and electrical

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:19.270
engineers refer to the type of
carrier that is dominating

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:36.906
its electrons.
And electrons,

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:08.500
when I went to school,
were negative, so this is an n-type

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:13.500
semiconductor.
Extrinsic n-type.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:18.500
We altered the electrical
properties of silicon by introducing

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:23.500
high level of supervalent.
In other words, phosphorus,

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:28.500
five is greater than four, so
supervalent dopant leads to

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:54.090
n-type semiconduction.
And now we can do it all over again.

00:33:54.090 --> 00:34:00.290
What can we do? I'm not going to
drag you through it.

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:06.490
This is something you can do at
home or wherever you like to work.

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:12.690
Repeat with subvalent impurity or
subvalent dopant.

00:34:12.690 --> 00:34:18.890
For example, boron.
What would happen if we were to

00:34:18.890 --> 00:34:24.150
introduce boron here?
Boron goes into the space and

00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:28.460
substitutes, but boron is Group 13
or Group III. Boron only has three

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:32.760
valence electrons,
so it fills one, two,

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:37.070
three. Boron is electropositive.
It is sitting there. It wants to

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:41.380
form the bond.
How do we handle this situation?

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:45.690
What do we do in order to balance
the fact that this is lacking one

00:34:45.690 --> 00:35:05.180
electron? Where is the electron
inventory in this crystal?

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:54.300
Where is the electron store?
If I go shopping for electrons,

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:58.610
where is the only place I can find
them? They are here.

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:02.920
They are in the bonds.
That is to say, they are in the

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:07.230
valence band. What will happen is
we will rip an electron out of the

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:11.530
valence band and move it over to
here. And, when we do that,

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:15.840
what happens if I take an electron
out of here? What is left behind?

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:20.660
A hole. Let's generate a hole.
Every time I introduce a subvalent

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:25.990
impurity, I call for an electron out
of the valence band and generate a

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:31.330
hole. And where is that hole going
to lie? We can go through the same

00:35:31.330 --> 00:35:36.660
analogy and we will find that the
energy level of that hole is sitting

00:35:36.660 --> 00:35:41.990
just above the valence band.
But the electrons are sitting in

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:47.330
the valence band,
so how do I get the electrons out of

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:52.190
the valence band up into this level?
Thermal excitation.

00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:56.590
And guess what this energy
difference is.

00:35:56.590 --> 00:36:00.990
It is on the order of the thermal
energy, and so I get thermal

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:05.390
ionization of the valence electrons
up into this level.

00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:09.790
This level is a place where
electrons go. It accepts electrons.

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:23.713
It is called the acceptor level.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:23.630
So now we have this configuration.
Conduction band, valence band,

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:29.270
subvalent impurity.
This is not to scale,

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:34.900
of course. This is on the order of
0.02 eV. And this is called the

00:36:34.900 --> 00:36:40.540
acceptor level.
We get thermal excitation leaving

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:46.180
holes behind. Thermal excitation
promotes the electrons up to here

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:51.210
and leaves behind holes.
Every time I put in a subvalent

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:55.640
impurity the result is a hole,
so I can control the hole population.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:37:00.070
And the same thing will happen,
if you go through this analogy what

00:37:00.070 --> 00:37:04.490
will happen? N will no longer equal
p. Instead, the number of positives

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:08.920
is going to exceed the number of
negatives. Now ne will be much less

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:13.350
than nh. N will be less than p.
And so this material will be

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:17.780
rendered a positive conductor.
It is going to be dominantly hole

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:24.280
conduction.
So this is now an extrinsic p-type

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:32.850
semiconductor.
What is the template here?

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:41.420
Subvalent dopant calls for
electrons, generates holes and makes

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:55.440
a p-type semiconductor.
That is amazing.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:55.160
Now I can take these and make a
sandwich out of these things.

00:37:55.160 --> 00:38:00.330
I can do this. This is all silicon.
I could dope this side with

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:05.490
phosphorus. Let's say the right is
phosphorus doped and the left side

00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:10.660
is boron doped.
That means the left side will be

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:15.830
p-type, the right side will be
n-type. And what do I have here?

00:38:15.830 --> 00:38:34.193
I have a p-n junction. I have a
solid state rectifier.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:25.300
If I put an AC signal in here,
I get rectification. This is the

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:29.610
solid state. It is fantastic.
I have been talking about elemental

00:38:29.610 --> 00:38:33.920
semiconductors,
but these are found not only in

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:38.230
elements. This is just leftover
from last day.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:42.530
We saw this last day.
You can have compounds that are

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:46.840
semiconductors.
So far we talked about just Group

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:50.930
IV.
We talked about silicon and

00:38:50.930 --> 00:38:54.810
germanium. Tin is very,
very mildly semiconducting,

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:58.680
but these are the two workhorses.
And, in fact, it is dominantly

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:02.550
silicon. But now,
look, you can take Group III and

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:06.430
Group V and make covalent compounds.
And they, too, have band gaps on

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:10.300
this interval.
We have an entire palette here that

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:14.180
we can paint on.
For example, let's look at this

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:18.060
homologous series with aluminum
antimonide 1.52 electron

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:21.570
volts band gap.
Aluminum nitride 6.

00:39:21.570 --> 00:39:24.730
. Aluminum nitride is an insulator.
It is a very strong material. We

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:27.890
use it in my lab as a refractory.
It resists high temperature

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:31.050
corrosion. Now,
what is going on?

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:34.200
The difference in electronegativity.
These are covalent bonds,

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.360
greater difference in
electronegativity,

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.520
higher bond energy.
And that occurs in all of these

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.680
columns as you go up.
So an increase in electronegativity

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.840
difference is an increase in bond
strength, and an increase in bond

00:39:46.840 --> 00:40:06.680
strength means an increase
in band gap energy.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
And some of these are really
interesting. Indium antimonide has

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
a band gap of about two-tenths of an
electron volt,

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
which means that its absorption edge
is 7 times 10 to the minus 67

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
micrometers, which puts it in the IR.
And this is one of the materials

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
that would be used as a sensor for
night vision. Because what are you

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
really sensing when you are looking
at night? You are sensing heat.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
You don't see the human body. You
see the heat coming from

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:21.870
the human body.
If everything is cold then there is

00:40:21.870 --> 00:40:25.620
no delta T and you don't see
anything. Over here,

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:29.370
cadmium sulfide is 5 times 10 to the
minus 7. That is right smack dab in

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:33.120
the middle of the visible.
When I was a child my father had a

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:36.870
35 millimeter camera.
It had a cadmium sulfide light

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:40.620
meter, and we would match the needle
with the incoming radiation and

00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:44.370
cadmium sulfide.
Well, I never understood why it was

00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:48.120
cadmium sulfide until I understood
band gap. And, obviously,

00:40:48.120 --> 00:41:06.973
there it is.
You can also think about what

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
happens if you are photographing
something that is dominantly red and

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
your light meter is parked in the
middle of the yellow?

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.000
You wonder why your photographs are
overexposed. Think about that some

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000
time. Now, the last thing I want to
tell you is that not only do you

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000
have solid semiconductors,
you have liquid semiconductors.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000
And when silicon melts, it is not a
semiconductor.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Silicon melts,
the band gap collapses and molten

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.500
silicon behaves as a liquid metal.
But, for example,

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:09.500
something like cadmium telluride,
which is useful in night vision, as

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:14.500
a solid has a band gap on the order
of 1.45 electron volts.

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:19.500
As a liquid, it still has a band
gap. It is about 0.

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:24.500
electron volts. It is parked down
in the infrared.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:29.500
And the transition metal oxides
also do this. Liquid titania is

00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:53.860
dominantly an electronic conductor.
Not an ionic conductor because its

00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:57.590
band gap is parked there.
And this is of interest to some of

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:01.330
the work in my lab where we are
looking at trying to set the stage

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:05.060
for lunar colonization where you
would want to get oxygen out of the

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:08.790
surface of the moon.
The surface of the moon is not made

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:12.530
out of green cheese,
I am sorry to tell you.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:16.260
It is made dominantly of iron oxide
and titanium oxide.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:36.053
That is why it is so brilliantly
white. It is titania.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:24.280
It is 50% oxygen but tightly bound.
And, if you want to electrolyze the

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:28.570
moon, you have to somehow repress
this liquid semiconduction.

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:32.850
That is a topic of research.
This is probably a good place to

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:37.140
stay. And what we are going to do
next day is we are going to start

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:41.420
onto the treatment of solids and
crystal. But I don't want a lot of

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:45.710
moving. It is 11:47 and we still
have a few minutes.

00:42:45.710 --> 00:43:04.086
Let's see. What do we want to talk
about?

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:55.830
We will move past this.
We will get to this next day.

00:42:55.830 --> 00:43:01.660
And what I wanted to talk about
today was this image here.

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:07.490
This image is an image of the first
rectifying solid state diode.

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:13.330
This was done at Bell Labs in
Murray Hill, New Jersey in December

00:43:13.330 --> 00:43:19.160
of 1947. What you are looking at
here is a piece of single crystal

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:36.053
germanium and the various
leads and so on.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:30.550
And this was able to perform the
function of a diode.

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:36.100
Now, if I told you that someday
there would be 16 million of those

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:41.660
on a piece of real estate about the
size of your fingernail you would

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:47.220
say that I was crazy.
So what has happened from that day

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:52.130
to this day?
Do you think I could get the

00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:56.390
document camera on,
please? I am going to show you

00:43:56.390 --> 00:44:00.660
where we have gone.
Let's see. Oh, look at this.

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:04.930
Let's look at Pentium. There is
Pentium. We have a gazillion of

00:44:04.930 --> 00:44:09.190
these things underneath the gold
here. Everything is covered in gold

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:13.460
because electrical engineers are
very superstitious.

00:44:13.460 --> 00:44:17.730
They get nervous exposing wires so
they plate everything with gold

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:37.326
because they heard somewhere that
gold is chemically inert.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:27.090
Underneath there is,
well, here you can see that there is

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:32.180
the unit. It is sitting there.
All of this. And here is the

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:37.270
suspension. All of this spider web
is being able to address all of the

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:42.360
various devices.
It started with that first one.

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:47.450
And here is sort of the
intermediate. This is taking the

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:52.450
silicon that I showed you last day.
These are individual devices that

00:44:52.450 --> 00:44:57.360
have been put on the silicon through
photolithography.

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:02.270
What are we doing?
We are making masks and we are

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:07.170
conducting these doping operations
to set up the various devices.

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:12.080
And we can make many of them and
then break them up and eventually

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:30.026
put them into something
like this and so on.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.500
That is the result of a long history
of understanding the processing of

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:06.000
devices based upon the chemistry
that started with what?

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.500
What started all of this?
The search for octet stability.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:15.000
Never forget that. That is what
started this, the search for octet

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.666
stability. OK. We will
see you on Friday.
