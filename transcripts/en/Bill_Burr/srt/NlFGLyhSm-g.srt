1
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:06,850
Like a

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,590
boss.
I think she's coming around.

3
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:12,310
We went to the movies last
night and we saw a gravity,

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:16,720
we gotta find ourselves
a new kind of grabbing.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,360
Um, and that was fucking
amazing. But you know what?

6
00:00:22,361 --> 00:00:27,361
Sucks less fucking like the last five
times I've gone to go see a movie in Imax,

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,530
you know, neo, he sets it up and I
always say, look, this is Imax, right?

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,750
This is Imex. Yes. Yes. The Timex,
the time, right? There's like Imax.

9
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:41,470
And then there's Imax light
where it's the smaller screen.

10
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,740
The only fucking time I've ever gone
to a movie and I really saw it in Imax,

11
00:00:44,741 --> 00:00:47,470
is when I saw the Heath Ledger Batman.

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,680
Now I'm always smiling.

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,070
Little fight.
I like that.

14
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:06,990
And that was one of those deals where I
couldn't see the cons head in front of

15
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:11,070
me and I felt like I was going to fall
off the edge of the earth. All right,

16
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,200
that's IMEX. What I saw last
night was not IMX. That was the,

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,070
uh,
that was the bud light of imax where it's,

18
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,440
it is a giant screen.

19
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:23,860
Yeah.

20
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,700
But like to me, Imax is all you can
see is the screen in front of you.

21
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,500
So fucking annoying. Those douche
bags down there on universal citywalk,

22
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,000
they got like three Imax. Once
they got the real one, you know,

23
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:42,060
the Alec Baldwin won and then they got
the Billy Baldwin and the fucking Stephen

24
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:44,680
Baldwin won. And if you're not
careful when you go down there,

25
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:46,150
they fucking pass you off.

26
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,130
Yeah, exactly. And both are really
rocking it at this point. Word happy.

27
00:01:51,131 --> 00:01:54,700
Pleased to report the report is good.
So far so good.

28
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:58,070
You know, not saying that it's
not still a good experience.

29
00:01:58,071 --> 00:02:02,120
Not saying that those aren't two fine
actors, but it's not Alec Patriotic.

30
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,013
It's not him.

31
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,270
He treated act patriot. I
love it. I love it. I love it.

32
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,770
All right, so last, so I was
a little disappointed with
that, but other than that,

33
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:13,530
it was fucking great.
Sandra Bullock killed it and um,

34
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,420
Jesus Christ. Um, and it's just,

35
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,440
just the thought of, I
think I could actually, uh,

36
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:28,610
I could be at peace floating away from
a station in dying that way and slowly

37
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:32,300
just having the oxygen go out is lonely,

38
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:37,360
is that would seem
just the fucking,

39
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,340
as long as I wasn't just twirling
through the air, doing somersaults,

40
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,220
then there's the earth. Then
there's this [inaudible] I,

41
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:48,820
I couldn't,
I could

42
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,420
fucking handle that if I was
just sitting there floating,

43
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,960
looking back at earth and
just sort of drifting away.

44
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,500
I think that that would be a
pretty fucking cool way to die.

45
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,360
What do you just gradually go to sleep?
I don't know.

46
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:04,450
If you breathe in and only carbon dioxide,
do you get like a headache?

47
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,520
I mean that that way.
It's such a fucking peaceful way to go.

48
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:15,370
If you're going to die
before your time. Okay. Okay.

49
00:03:15,371 --> 00:03:19,940
What do you have fallen off
a building. Fox Plat, right?

50
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,400
Fucking fucking wind in your ears.

51
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,290
You're going down making no fucking
whatever noise you'd make on the way down.

52
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,400
Fuck that.

53
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,780
Get eaten like I think beyond,
what would you do?

54
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,980
Would you rather get burned to death?
Burned alive

55
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,670
or get eaten by a shark?

56
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,320
I'm eaten alive is fucking brutal.
Like if I had to get eaten alive,

57
00:03:47,321 --> 00:03:50,350
I'm going with the big cat,
big cat in Africa.

58
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,160
It's fucking over after seeing
the lion tamer there. Um,

59
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:58,360
which really that's,
that's really just a title.

60
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:04,030
Nobody tames a fucking lion. You
basically, you had a good day. You're,

61
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:06,940
you're on a good run, but you know
what's going to happen eventually.

62
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:07,840
You know what I mean?

63
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,790
She charged me,

64
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:16,440
oftentimes I fishery the charter
charter right away. I guess the river,

65
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,860
a charge and sheer run.

66
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,310
And this is got to be a mind game because
I'm technically understand chance when

67
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,250
they're too vague. She's
still a baby. She's 225.

68
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,910
All right. You're not taming them. Okay.

69
00:04:31,911 --> 00:04:34,250
You're trying to break their spirit,
but at the end of the day,

70
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,340
they're a fucking lion and that
the king of the beast. Okay.

71
00:04:37,341 --> 00:04:41,390
Although some would say that the Bengal
tiger could kick the shit out of a lion.

72
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,880
I don't know about kick the shit out
of him, but uh, I dunno. But anyways,

73
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,830
just watching that are that Lion
Tamer in Vegas. Like when the,

74
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,660
when that thing grabbed him by the throat,

75
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,890
that dude went limp in like
fucking two seconds. It was like,

76
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,360
when you watch the UFC,
you know when someone gets choked out,

77
00:05:02,361 --> 00:05:05,330
you get choked out real fucking
quick. So I don't have, I wouldn't,

78
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:09,230
I wouldn't want to get mauled. Like, I
wouldn't want to get attacked by a bear.

79
00:05:09,231 --> 00:05:12,290
They're very sloppy, you know
what I mean? They're very like,

80
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,450
rip your face off and uh,
you know,

81
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:17,810
eat a little bit here and then come
back later after they took a nap kind of

82
00:05:17,811 --> 00:05:22,400
shit. I like lions. Tigers,
they just get right to it.

83
00:05:22,401 --> 00:05:25,850
They grab you by your fucking
throat in two seconds. That's it.

84
00:05:25,851 --> 00:05:29,900
You're out it dead sober.
And then they, you know,

85
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,553
they have a meal,

86
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,890
I don't know. But anyways, when you look
at all those, and then the worst of all,

87
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:46,170
the getting eaten alive other
than a fucking Komodo Dragon,

88
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,280
which would basically bite ya and then
slowly follow you around for the next

89
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:55,220
three days is the poison takes over.
You know,

90
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,710
as you're laying there and the
things like two feet away, you know,

91
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:01,700
just staring at you.

92
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:06,260
It's Lizard Tongue flicking at the side
of your face but not eaten yet. You know,

93
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,140
that's fucking horrific.
Um,

94
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,090
plus you know, at Brett's towels
they just, they just don't,

95
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,040
they just don't have that.
There's, there's no emotion. Yeah,

96
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,043
the heartless.

97
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,590
They don't give a fuck mammals
and even like a lion or something,

98
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:28,370
they have some sort of understanding what
the fuck it is that doing. Just like,

99
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,730
you know, reptiles. I like the terminator.

100
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,313
[inaudible]

101
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:46,680
not even terminate a could talk.
I don't know what the fuck they are,

102
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:49,530
but they freak me out. I don't lie.
I don't like them. I really don't.

103
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,150
I respect mammals. I have, I,
I don't like reptiles there.

104
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,900
I made that statement and I'm sure I'm
going to get some backlash on that and

105
00:06:57,901 --> 00:07:01,830
I'm prepared to go on CNN and defend
myself when I go on split screen with some

106
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:06,120
fucking lizard lover. But anyways,
so if you're floating through space,

107
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:09,770
like I could die like that.
I definitely could,

108
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,390
as long as I wasn't cold,

109
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,270
as long as that's suit held up
and I was just sort of floating,

110
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,700
that would kind of be the most,
uh,

111
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:24,540
that would be the ultimate premature
death. You're going to die in your 30s,

112
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:29,280
forties or whatever. I got, I still had
half my life ahead of me or whatever. Um,

113
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,020
as long as I wasn't tumbling,
if I was just sitting there floating,

114
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:38,250
looking back at the planet for
the last 20 years of my life,

115
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,160
and that's pretty fucking awesome.
You know,

116
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:43,830
me and lance bass up
there just hanging out.

117
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,750
You're going to make it

118
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:05,760
[inaudible]

119
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:10,310
can you imagine that? The first, you
know the first one, the first one, okay.

120
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:13,310
That they send up there with a bunch
of civilians. They was going to be,

121
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,670
somebody is going to freak the fuck out

122
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:18,893
that

123
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:31,820
[inaudible] [inaudible]

124
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,600
and I guarantee you they gonna they're
gonna, they're gonna have something,

125
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,150
some soda, some guy just runs down the
island, just like puts a Syringe, right?

126
00:08:41,151 --> 00:08:45,920
D of fucking next seat on freak everybody
else out when it finally hits you that

127
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:47,270
you're leaving the planet

128
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:52,680
like God,

129
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,260
there is so many things that
scares the shit out of me.

130
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:05,230
But I gotta admit when George Clooney
just spun off into space and that fucking

131
00:09:05,451 --> 00:09:08,420
movie, whatever the hell it was,
but he was so nonchalant about it.

132
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:10,100
Like I didn't care about his character.

133
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,170
Oh yeah, look at that.
There's a Serengeti. Oh, I
like it. This time of year

134
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,840
can float it off.
They made them to heroic.

135
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,783
I'm coming again.

136
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:24,403
Oh my God.

137
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,153
Hi Ryan.

138
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,370
We should see the sun on the Ganges.

139
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,503
It's amazing.

140
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,180
Alright.
Cause I don't give a fuck.

141
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,990
You know how much balls you
have as an astronaut and you do.

142
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:49,660
You have balls the size of my
fucking head, which is huge.

143
00:09:49,661 --> 00:09:54,070
If you don't know who I am. Um, do
you never take a gander at it? Um,

144
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:59,140
I don't give a fuck who you are. You start
slipping off into fucking space. You'd,

145
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,360
I don't care how fucking bad as you are.

146
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:06,540
It is the second you lose your grip on
the space station and you start floating

147
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:11,190
off and the other people in there are
asleep or some shit, and you're just,

148
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,790
that's it. You're done. There's no
way. You just go like, well, you know,

149
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:20,770
I had a nice run. I guess I'm going
to set the record rebated space.

150
00:10:20,771 --> 00:10:21,940
You know,
you're not going to say that

151
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,670
it is going to be at the line

152
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:34,220
and then it just fucking gone.

153
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,550
That is a fucking lonely
ass God damn death.

154
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:41,983
Okay.

155
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,250
Could I be saying more obvious shit?
Oh,

156
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:48,810
is it built to slip off into
the fucking space by yourself?

157
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,040
Now what happens?

158
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,220
Okay.

159
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,080
Hey,
remember the hole in the ozone layer?

160
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:56,120
How come they don't have a
fucking talk about that anymore?

161
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,350
Does that thing gonna do they fix it?

162
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:08,970
Oh my God.

163
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,060
Fuck this.
$25,000

164
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:17,783
tiger.

165
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,100
[inaudible] fuck it.

166
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,033
[inaudible]

167
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:57,920
[inaudible].
