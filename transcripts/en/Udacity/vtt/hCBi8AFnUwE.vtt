00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.770
All right, let's take a look at these--now, in order to figure out the percentage of improvement

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.020
for this first question, we need to figure out the actual cost for each of these tours.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:13.650
So if we look at the improved shorter tour, the cost is 20 when we add all these up,

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.440
and similarly for the true path, the cost is 24.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.070
Now, in order to find the percentage of improvement what we need to do

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.240
is take 1 and subtract this fraction here.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.120
What we get then is right about 16.67%.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.760
Now, for the second question--to find the approximation factor, we need to find

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.260
the optimal tour and it turns out that the optimal tour starting from A just goes way along

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.450
the outside here and if you add these up, you get 15.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.930
And the cost of the improved tour that we were using is 20.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.130
If we want to find the approximation factor, simply see that this is four thirds,

00:00:48.130 --> 99:59:59.000
which is approximately 1.33.
