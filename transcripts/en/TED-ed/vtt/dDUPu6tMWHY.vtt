00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:11.735
Mounting his skinny steed,

00:00:11.735 --> 00:00:13.557
the protagonist of Don Quixote

00:00:13.557 --> 00:00:16.244
charges an army of giants.

00:00:16.244 --> 00:00:18.039
In his eyes, it is his duty

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.542
to vanquish these behemoths

00:00:20.542 --> 00:00:24.521
in the name of his beloved lady, Dulcinea.

00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:28.305
However, this act of valor is ill conceived.

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:31.102
As his squire Sancho Panza explains to him

00:00:31.102 --> 00:00:34.386
time and again, these aren’t giants;

00:00:34.386 --> 00:00:36.790
they are merely windmills.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.471
Don Quixote is undeterred,

00:00:38.483 --> 00:00:39.938
but his piercing lance

00:00:39.938 --> 00:00:42.807
is soon caught in their sails.

00:00:42.807 --> 00:00:44.006
Never discouraged,

00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:46.828
the knight stands proudly, and becomes

00:00:46.828 --> 00:00:50.367
even more convinced of his mission.

00:00:50.336 --> 00:00:52.039
This sequence encapsulates

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.362
much of what is loved about Don Quixote,

00:00:55.362 --> 00:00:58.868
the epic, illogical, and soulful tale of

00:00:58.868 --> 00:01:00.236
Alonso Quijano,

00:01:00.236 --> 00:01:02.626
who becomes the clumsy but valiant

00:01:02.626 --> 00:01:05.608
Don Quixote of la Mancha, known as

00:01:05.608 --> 00:01:09.305
the Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance.

00:01:09.305 --> 00:01:11.393
Originally published in two volumes,

00:01:11.393 --> 00:01:13.495
the narrative follows Don Quixote

00:01:13.495 --> 00:01:16.275
as he travels through central and northern Spain

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:20.158
fighting the forces of evil.

00:01:20.158 --> 00:01:22.585
Despite Don Quixote’s lofty imagination,

00:01:22.585 --> 00:01:25.198
his creator, Miguel de Cervantes,

00:01:25.198 --> 00:01:27.581
could never have imagined his book would

00:01:27.581 --> 00:01:31.923
become the best-selling novel of all time.

00:01:31.924 --> 00:01:34.164
Barring 5 years as a soldier,

00:01:34.168 --> 00:01:37.151
and 5 more enslaved by pirates,

00:01:37.151 --> 00:01:39.665
Cervantes spent most of his life

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:43.092
as a struggling poet and playwright.

00:01:43.092 --> 00:01:45.301
It wasn’t until his late 50’s

00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:48.017
that he published his greatest creation:

00:01:48.017 --> 00:01:52.666
an epic satire of chivalry novels.

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:53.425
At this time,

00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:55.780
medieval books chronicling the adventures

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.790
of knights and their moral code

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.179
dominated European culture.

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.291
While Cervantes was a fan,

00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:04.748
he was weary of these repetitive tomes,

00:02:04.748 --> 00:02:07.696
which focused more on listing heroic feats

00:02:07.696 --> 00:02:10.087
than character development.

00:02:10.087 --> 00:02:12.598
To challenge them, he wrote Don Quixote,

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:15.740
the story of a hidalgo, or idle nobleman,

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.615
who spends his days and nights

00:02:17.615 --> 00:02:20.256
reading chivalry novels.

00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:22.830
Driven mad by these stories,

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.544
he fashions himself a champion for the downtrodden.

00:02:26.544 --> 00:02:28.306
Everyone in his village

00:02:28.306 --> 00:02:31.356
tries to convince him to give up his lunacy,

00:02:31.356 --> 00:02:34.227
going so far as to burn some of the

00:02:34.227 --> 00:02:37.662
lurid books in his personal library.

00:02:37.662 --> 00:02:40.155
But Don Quixote is unstoppable.

00:02:40.155 --> 00:02:43.072
He dresses up in old shining armor,

00:02:43.072 --> 00:02:44.962
mounts his skinny horse,

00:02:44.962 --> 00:02:48.380
and leaves his village in search of glory.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.462
Cervantes’ novel

00:02:49.462 --> 00:02:51.687
unfolds as a collection of episodes

00:02:51.687 --> 00:02:54.749
detailing the mishaps of the valiant knight.

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:57.067
Yet unlike the chivalry books

00:02:57.067 --> 00:02:59.803
and perhaps all other prior fiction,

00:02:59.803 --> 00:03:02.535
Cervantes’ story deeply investigates

00:03:02.535 --> 00:03:04.808
the protagonist’s inner life.

00:03:04.808 --> 00:03:08.351
Don Quixote matures as the narrative develops,

00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:12.047
undergoing a noticeable transformation.

00:03:12.047 --> 00:03:13.813
This literary revelation

00:03:13.813 --> 00:03:16.868
has led many scholars to call Don Quixote

00:03:16.868 --> 00:03:19.448
the first modern novel.

00:03:19.448 --> 00:03:21.345
And this character development

00:03:21.345 --> 00:03:23.756
doesn’t happen in isolation.

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:26.077
Early on, Don Quixote is joined

00:03:26.077 --> 00:03:28.136
by a villager-turned-squire

00:03:28.136 --> 00:03:30.274
named Sancho Panza.

00:03:30.274 --> 00:03:32.135
Sancho and Don Quixote

00:03:32.135 --> 00:03:34.148
are a study in opposites:

00:03:34.148 --> 00:03:36.654
with one as the grounded realist

00:03:36.654 --> 00:03:39.248
to the other’s idealism.

00:03:39.248 --> 00:03:43.145
Their lively, evolving friendship is often credited

00:03:43.145 --> 00:03:46.380
as the original hero and sidekick duo,

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.678
inspiring centuries of fictional partnerships.

00:03:50.678 --> 00:03:53.305
Don Quixote was a huge success.

00:03:53.305 --> 00:03:55.659
Numerous editions were published across Europe

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:57.724
in the seventeenth century.

00:03:57.724 --> 00:03:59.053
Even in the Americas,

00:03:59.053 --> 00:04:01.521
where the Church banned all novels

00:04:01.521 --> 00:04:03.639
for being sinful distractions,

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.029
audiences were known to enjoy pirated editions.

00:04:08.029 --> 00:04:09.809
The book was so well received that

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:12.627
readers clamored for more.

00:04:12.627 --> 00:04:15.508
After a rival author attempted to cash in

00:04:15.508 --> 00:04:18.722
on a fake follow-up, Cervantes released

00:04:18.722 --> 00:04:21.629
the official sequel in response.

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:23.880
Now published alongside the first volume

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.576
as a completed text, this second volume picks up

00:04:27.576 --> 00:04:29.890
where the original left off,

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:35.020
only now Don Quixote and Sancho have become folk heroes.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.835
Just as in real-life, Cervantes included

00:04:37.835 --> 00:04:42.206
his novel’s success in the world of his characters.

00:04:42.206 --> 00:04:45.214
This unconventional meta-awareness

00:04:45.214 --> 00:04:48.145
created philosophical complexity,

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.227
as the knight and his squire ponder

00:04:50.227 --> 00:04:52.692
the meaning of their story.

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:55.279
Unfortunately, Cervantes had sold

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:57.836
the book’s publishing rights for very little.

00:04:57.836 --> 00:05:00.361
He died rich in fame alone.

00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:03.009
But his treatise on the power of creativity

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:05.368
and individualism has inspired

00:05:05.368 --> 00:05:06.370
art,

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.502
literature,

00:05:07.502 --> 00:05:09.002
popular culture,

00:05:09.002 --> 00:05:11.419
and even political revolution.

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.292
Don Quixote argues

00:05:13.292 --> 00:05:17.665
that our imagination greatly informs our actions,

00:05:17.665 --> 00:05:19.813
making us capable of change,

00:05:19.815 --> 00:05:22.252
and, indeed, making us human.
