00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.070
Hey,

It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:07.770
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.890
just checking in on you.
Oh,
I almost passed out to you on that.

4
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.540
I'm just checking in.
I just see how your week's going.
How's it going,
man?

5
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:23.880
You're almost there.
You're almost there.

6
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.610
You're almost to the weekend.
It's going to be your world again.

7
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.830
You're gonna get to do psy d side when you wake up.

8
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.560
Do side now.
[inaudible]

9
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.950
I said greatest fucking thing about Saturday morning.

10
00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.850
You decide all right now I don't care if you got kids.

11
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.410
I don't care if you've got a wife.
You've got a husband in this day and I he,

12
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.470
you guys [inaudible] I need you to shut the fuck up.

13
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.800
You're not the boss of me.
It's sad.

14
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.520
Saturday I'm staying in this fucking bed.
I hear the kids crying,
sweetheart.

15
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.990
I am crying.
What do they cry?
They didn't want to fuck.
They're crying about,

16
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.250
Huh?
They downstairs.
You know.
Well,
what are,
what are they doing right now?

17
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.730
What are they crying about?
What toy to somebody want that?

18
00:01:14.731 --> 00:01:18.780
Somebody else he edited it.
That's not a life or death situation.

19
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.470
I am going to lay in this fucking bed and I want to get up when I decide

20
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.030
that's what Saturday is all about.

21
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.050
Sanity and feeling you have on Saturday morning when you can basically do

22
00:01:34.051 --> 00:01:36.150
whatever the fuck it is you want,

23
00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.000
provided the woman in your life is afraid of you

24
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.043
joking.

25
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.180
You can do whatever it is the fuck you want to do.
All right.

26
00:01:48.181 --> 00:01:51.960
That feeling right there,
that's the feeling that you should be working towards.

27
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.190
Okay.
That misery,
that Monday through Friday awaken,

28
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.930
I got away.
Glad I got to wake up cause I have,
cause I fucking,

29
00:02:00.931 --> 00:02:05.010
I get an agreement with these people down the street that I have to be there and

30
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:10.011
they have to be able to see my face at this particular fucking time and I got to

31
00:02:10.321 --> 00:02:14.790
trudge in here and do this fucking job.
However,
on staff,

32
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.440
you get to feel what it's like to be living your dream
acquainted.

33
00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.610
You've gotta be thinking,
well bill,
I can't fucking lay in a bed all fucking,

34
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.070
you know,
Monday through Sunday.
How would I eat?
How would I eat that?

35
00:02:29.071 --> 00:02:32.970
Right there is what handouts or for,
it's what?

36
00:02:32.971 --> 00:02:37.110
Seven 11 to four you want to sleep in every day?
This is what you do.

37
00:02:37.111 --> 00:02:40.740
You sit outside of seven 11 you make a little sign,
all right?

38
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.260
You don't write it on a nice piece of notebook paper.

39
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.290
You've got to write it on like a piece of trash you so people know that you're

40
00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:50.950
struggling right now fucking with you.
Somehow you got,

41
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.330
you got to become self employed.
You got to work for yourself.

42
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.620
If you want that Saturday morning grant,
you're going to still be working on,

43
00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.000
only get to work Monday through Friday when you're self employed,

44
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:03.910
you can work Monday through Sunday,
but you'll get up when you want to get up,

45
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.843
<v 1>all right?</v>

46
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.140
<v 0>And you'll at least have that feeling of a little bit of control and freedom.</v>

47
00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.380
Then he can take it too far.
Like the ultimate Saturday.
I'll get up when the,

48
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.990
whoever the fuck I want to is that fatty cakes there in North Korea.

49
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.200
Okay.
And you can tell by his build,
that Guy Sleeps Til at least 11 every day.

50
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.520
You know,
I bet he has like kid pajamas,
doesn't he look like he would,
you know,

51
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.830
giant speed racer bed or some shit.
Something about him.

52
00:03:34.831 --> 00:03:36.090
He seems very childish,

53
00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.323
<v 1>you know.</v>

54
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.230
<v 0>I Dunno.
You know what it is.
I bet he just,
because he was the,
the dictators son,</v>

55
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:47.740
nobody ever picked on him,
but he looked in the mirror and he was like,

56
00:03:47.741 --> 00:03:51.460
the only reason why they're not picking on me right now is because

57
00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.530
if they did,
my dad would feed them naked to two wild dogs.

58
00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.450
That's the only thing stopping them.

59
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.060
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

60
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.520
<v 0>Look how fat I am.
Look at me just standing there looking at his hair.</v>

61
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.200
Hairy hairless fucking torso.
Right.
I bet he's getting any right.

62
00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.150
Some manhole.
Fucking level.
Any,

63
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:21.600
there's some whole enemy's trying to fill.
Um,
anyways,

64
00:04:21.601 --> 00:04:22.890
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

65
00:04:22.891 --> 00:04:27.690
How about those Cleveland Goddamn Indians.
21 victories in a row.

66
00:04:27.691 --> 00:04:30.630
You're never going to see this again.
I,
that's fucking amazing.

67
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.690
That is really amazing.
Um,

68
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.220
and how great would it be to see them and there wasn't,

69
00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.220
was it 1948 they ended it this year?
I don't know about my red sox.

70
00:04:41.221 --> 00:04:42.054
I don't know.

71
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.120
I'm going to keep saying that hope and I jinxed them into coming together.

72
00:04:45.121 --> 00:04:47.520
I kind of fucking fell out of love with this team.

73
00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.910
I've said it before when they fucking yelled at Eckersley I was like,
come on.

74
00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.330
There was no discipline about,
that's a hall of Famer.

75
00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.510
You know what you do in a hall of famer walks in a room.
You shut the fuck up.

76
00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.110
That's what you do.
And if he criticizes you,

77
00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.520
you say,
okay,
fair enough.
I'll try it a little better.
Their sport.

78
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.830
Maybe ask for zoonotic.
Now you don't ask for his autograph.

79
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.750
You want to be professional.
You want,
if you want to act like you're,
you're,

80
00:05:15.751 --> 00:05:16.980
you're in the same business.

81
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.970
You never asked for an autograph within the same industry.
Okay?

82
00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.510
Don't ever forget that.
I've seen people do it.
It's an ugly,
ugly fucking scene.

83
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.390
I know a guy that fucking play golf in a celebrity fucking tournament,

84
00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:34.860
right?
Why can't I ever type in my password and talk at the same fucking time?

85
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.993
It's unbelievable.

86
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.860
He played in the celebrity golf tournament and one of the guys in his force and

87
00:05:40.861 --> 00:05:44.880
was actually a fan of his and then fucking hanging out the palling around.

88
00:05:44.881 --> 00:05:48.180
Everything's going great.
And then when they would done at the end of the round,

89
00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:52.590
he asked for a picture and the guy's face just dropped.
And that was it.

90
00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.060
It was over.
He went from hanging out with that guy to be in back in the crowd,

91
00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.860
thrown his panties at him.
What is my point?

92
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.900
My point is I like sleeping in on.
Um,

93
00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.780
alright.
Let's see what's going.

94
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.320
I don't have anything to talk about today because I'm just stuck in a fucking

95
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.580
writer's room.
We just were doing the table read this morning for episode,
uh,

96
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.710
three Oh seven.
I can't be screaming like daughter's still sleeping.
My mom,

97
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.260
my wife's probably going to fucking kill me right now on say,

98
00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.530
<v 2>yeah.</v>

99
00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:24.960
<v 0>Is there a reason why ever since Bill Clinton,</v>

100
00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.010
they just won't let somebody be president?
I really think you know what it is.

101
00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:30.840
I think it's because of,

102
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.680
I think it's because of social media and 24 hours news networks and all of that

103
00:06:34.681 --> 00:06:38.720
type of shit.
This is like CNN,

104
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.270
CNN who refuses to cover any,

105
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.260
anything about Hillary and the Democratic Party,

106
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.330
ignoring the votes during the primary inboxing out Bernie Sanders who actually

107
00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:55.331
gotten more votes and then Hillary actually has the fucking balls to be like we

108
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:58.220
should do away with the electoral college.
Oh,

109
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.510
because the fuck over that you ran on Bernie Sanders then was done to you.

110
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.130
I've never seen such an entitled fucking person.

111
00:07:07.131 --> 00:07:08.860
Everybody talks about how entitled Trump is.

112
00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:11.870
And I'm not saying he isn't Jesus fucking Christ.

113
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.480
She really thought that that job was hers.
It's fucking unbelievable.

114
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.830
Anyways.
Um,

115
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.313
<v 2>okay.</v>

116
00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.540
<v 0>It's unfucking believable.
Um,
all right.</v>

117
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:30.430
It says Sean Spicer basically admitted that he was willing to lie for Trump.

118
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.820
Now,
what is shocking about that?

119
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.310
Do you think there was nobody in Obama's cabinet that was willing to lie for him

120
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.210
or bushes or Clinton's or first Bush or Reagan or Carter?

121
00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.070
That's what happens.
Think about in your life,

122
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.380
there's people you're willing to lie for.
You know,

123
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:58.550
your buddy's fucking hammered behind the wheel.
The cop comes up,
you sit down,

124
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.130
officer,
he's,
oh,
he's fine.
He's only had a couple of,
you know,
you do that.

125
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.993
It's a friend,

126
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.680
Jesus fucking Christ and everybody fucking sitting here acting like the

127
00:08:07.681 --> 00:08:09.900
president runs the country is fucking hilarious.

128
00:08:09.901 --> 00:08:11.520
Like his decisions aren't decided

129
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.820
pie all the money that you fucking need to get in the fucking office.
Right?

130
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.020
I don't know.
They keep saying to Trump,
use most of his own money.
I doubt it.

131
00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.390
I don't fucking know.
I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about.

132
00:08:24.391 --> 00:08:27.360
I'm just so fucking sick of people.
You know,

133
00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:31.320
acting like this guy is way worse than the other guy because the two or three

134
00:08:31.321 --> 00:08:34.500
issues other than that,
as far as the environment,

135
00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.070
as far as the food supply,
as far as the heroin epidemic,

136
00:08:38.071 --> 00:08:41.760
it's the exact same thing.
Don't fucking say shit about it.
Right?

137
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:47.580
Is that what it is?
I Dunno.
All right.
After Chicago,
Tj injury is found dead in a,

138
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.820
in hotel freezer.
Mystery lingers.

139
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.440
This is why I don't want you to think North Korea's latest nuclear tests so

140
00:08:55.441 --> 00:09:00.020
powerful.
It reshaped the mountain above it.
Okay,

141
00:09:00.021 --> 00:09:03.910
now we have,
what's nuclear power?
It's powerful.
Rush fires,

142
00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.790
cruise missile at ISPD stronghold.

143
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.130
Is that the cool way to say Isis?

144
00:09:10.131 --> 00:09:14.000
Now is I a stronghold in East Syria?

145
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.220
Russia is about to kick off a war game that is freaking out in NATO.

146
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:22.840
Here's what we know.
This is why I don't read the news.
I wouldn't,

147
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:26.090
I wouldn't know any of this.
It's a game having a game.

148
00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.730
They can't play a game in their own country.

149
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:33.050
Coordinated attack in southern Iraq kills at least 50

150
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:34.683
<v 1>yeah.</v>

151
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:39.820
<v 0>Okay.
No good news yet.
All right,
let's go to the United States.</v>

152
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:44.770
Let's see what good news is here.
Eight dead after South Florida nursing homes,

153
00:09:44.771 --> 00:09:47.710
air conditioning fails following Hurricane Irma.

154
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.173
<v 1>Great.</v>

155
00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.010
<v 0>Next one,
as the White House calls for her firing,</v>

156
00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:00.870
ESPN is Jamelle Hill address the elephant in the room.

157
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.710
What the fuck is this?

158
00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:11.320
How the fuck did we go from the White House to a reporter on ESPN?
Now this,

159
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.560
now this,
I'll tell you this here.
I got to read this one.
I got to read.

160
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.873
<v 1>All right,</v>

161
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.220
<v 0>here we go.
Here we go.
What did we say?</v>

162
00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:24.730
How's hours after a White House spokesperson called for Espn to fire her because

163
00:10:25.971 --> 00:10:29.990
she called president Trump a white supremacist on Twitter.

164
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.370
Jamil Hill or Jumel modal.

165
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:38.090
He'll tweet it about the topic Wednesday night saying she was going to address

166
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.170
the elephant in the room after becoming the latest flash point in a cultural

167
00:10:42.171 --> 00:10:45.560
skirmish that is involved.
The sports network.
Once again,

168
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.320
hashtagging your tweets.

169
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:54.370
Hashtag facts hill wrote my comments on Twitter express my personal belief,

170
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:56.570
my regard,

171
00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.600
my regret is that my comments at and the public way I made them painted ESPN in

172
00:11:02.031 --> 00:11:02.990
an unfair light.

173
00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:06.800
My respect for the company and my colleagues remains unconditional.
Yeah.

174
00:11:06.801 --> 00:11:09.680
How the fuck do you have that job?
And No,
you can't tweet some shit like that.

175
00:11:09.681 --> 00:11:12.710
You're going to get fired cause at the end of the day all ESPN gives a fuck

176
00:11:12.711 --> 00:11:17.570
about is ratings in,
in,
in money.
That's what they care about.
Uh,

177
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.990
all right,
so when asked Wednesday afternoon by the Post David

178
00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:26.900
Nakamura Nakamura,
that's a good last name.
Uh,
about hills original tweets.

179
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:31.460
Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she was unsure whether the president was aware of

180
00:11:31.461 --> 00:11:33.590
the kerfuffle they cause,

181
00:11:33.591 --> 00:11:35.940
but at course he was aware of the guy fucking tweets every day.

182
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:37.160
It's like a seventh grade girl.

183
00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.970
I think that's one of the more outrageous comments that anyone could make and

184
00:11:40.971 --> 00:11:44.720
certainly something that I think is fireable offense by ESPN.

185
00:11:44.721 --> 00:11:48.700
Get the fuck Outta here.
Oh,
give me a fucking break.

186
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:54.760
I love how ESPN thinks that reflects on them and all they is a cup of PBR or on,

187
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.570
you know,
further woo GC at a bar.
My President.
Oh,

188
00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:02.350
I ain't gonna want to see if the Yankees beat the fucking Indians tonight.

189
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.120
Yes,
you are.
What else are you going to do?

190
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:10.990
Read a book.
It's a sports network.

191
00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.830
This is some of the dumbest people on the planet.
My self included.

192
00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:19.170
Do you how many times I've tried,
I've gotten so disgusted with the NFL.

193
00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:24.090
I tried to walk away.
Then I just had to admit that I was too weak to do it.

194
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.090
I like how the NFL ratings are down now and they're trying to blame that stupid

195
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.320
Colin Kaepernick thing.
That's what it was.
Oh,
that's what w wasn't what,

196
00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.140
you know what it was is they just got greedy.

197
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:38.990
I think it's the NFL plus it goes in cycles too.
You know what I mean?

198
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:44.660
It's like the NBA where they had bird magic into fucking,
uh,

199
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.190
Jordan and then there was a little bit of a lull there for a minute.
Right.

200
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.770
And then like a,
I dunno.

201
00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:53.023
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

202
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:58.630
<v 0>I guess the spurs weren't fucking exciting enough.
Um,
I dunno.</v>

203
00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:02.920
And then you know,
eventually you other guys came along,
Lebron came along.
Yeah,

204
00:13:02.921 --> 00:13:06.310
the next one.
Right.
I think football goes to the same thing,

205
00:13:06.311 --> 00:13:08.980
but the problem is that these fleet,
these guys in the NFL,

206
00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:13.510
they're trying to go global and they're trying to a p like please,

207
00:13:13.511 --> 00:13:15.460
as many people as humanly possible.

208
00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:19.420
So they kind of abandoned their original family.

209
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.680
And you know where the NBA is right now.

210
00:13:20.681 --> 00:13:25.570
The NBA is where you two was when Bono started wearing those big fly glasses,

211
00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:27.310
the big mosquito glasses

212
00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:32.450
and was saying shit like this is the most surreal night of my life,
man.

213
00:13:32.451 --> 00:13:33.800
He started playing a character,

214
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:35.843
<v 1>you know,</v>

215
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:38.840
<v 0>in eight years they went from in</v>

216
00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.650
carrying a fucking white flag and all,

217
00:13:43.651 --> 00:13:45.300
whatever the fuck it is they were doing back then.

218
00:13:45.301 --> 00:13:48.900
I was never the big youtube guy.
Okay.
As I told you before,

219
00:13:48.901 --> 00:13:51.030
I didn't listen to the right music in the 80s.

220
00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:57.210
I was listening to a crocus and Hellickson.

221
00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:58.740
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

222
00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:00.840
<v 0>How's this in all those fucking beds?
You know what I mean?</v>

223
00:14:00.841 --> 00:14:04.590
And then I was watching sports and I was flunking math and French class.
I mean,

224
00:14:04.591 --> 00:14:06.690
that's basically what you've been listening to all these years.

225
00:14:06.691 --> 00:14:08.800
If you ever wondered,
um,

226
00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.760
I don't need to go to ancestry.com to figure out my mystery.

227
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:16.940
<v 3>Okay.</v>

228
00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:21.920
<v 0>I am a fucking dope.
I am a dopes.
Dope.
When I walk into a room,</v>

229
00:14:21.921 --> 00:14:25.240
dopes shut up just to listen to what your stupid thing I'm gonna say.

230
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.500
Um,
anyways.
Yeah.
They fucking,
they,

231
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.870
they did the pink thing.
Let's have the football players were paying.
I love how,

232
00:14:35.871 --> 00:14:40.871
like for some reason the fact that a football is a really male testosterone

233
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:49.630
aggressive thing that like for some reason guys have to apologize for that and

234
00:14:50.061 --> 00:14:52.700
they just can't,
is that the word?

235
00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:55.430
Feminate they can't make it like,

236
00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.030
like feminine enough all of a sudden

237
00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:04.260
cause all these feminist bitch moaning and complaining has all these

238
00:15:04.261 --> 00:15:08.170
corporations all in a myth like,
oh we don't want to be considered sexist.

239
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:12.120
The next thing you know they're wearing pink for a month is if the NFL gives a

240
00:15:12.121 --> 00:15:13.650
flying fuck

241
00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:20.810
about anything other than making money.
Cancer.

242
00:15:20.811 --> 00:15:24.050
This is what we care about.
Your brain Terman into scrambled eggs.
Yeah,

243
00:15:24.051 --> 00:15:26.360
we don't get,
and you killing yourself by the time you're 50.

244
00:15:26.361 --> 00:15:28.760
We don't give a fuck about that.
Oh,
is that what you did?

245
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:31.370
Here's 40 bucks for everybody who ever played the fucking game.

246
00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.370
They don't give a shit.
Um,
according to reports,

247
00:15:34.371 --> 00:15:37.980
they kept like 95 to $97 for every hundred dollars he made off of that pink shit

248
00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:38.960
.
So give me a fucking break.

249
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.120
They show people in the crowd that are in the military,

250
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:42.890
they charge that branch in the military.

251
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:46.490
They treat like a commercial as they tell you to support the troops.

252
00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:48.740
The Fuck Outta here.
Right?
So now what?

253
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:52.280
So now all these women's groups sit there bitch moaning and complaining.

254
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.790
So now they got,
they got female referees,
they get women calling the games.

255
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.160
They got the guys wearing pink for an entire fucking month.

256
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:01.670
They got lady Gaga singing at the fucking halftime at the super bowl.

257
00:16:02.060 --> 00:16:04.730
They took a total fucking left turn.

258
00:16:04.731 --> 00:16:08.750
And when you do that like you to do is you're going to lose a lot of your

259
00:16:08.751 --> 00:16:13.580
original fan base that are like,
hey man,
I liked him back when the boy,

260
00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.140
I like the first day album,

261
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:19.160
I saw him when there was only 8,000 people at the fucking show.

262
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:23.570
That's basically what they're going through and they're going to survive it and

263
00:16:23.571 --> 00:16:27.380
they're going to transition from,
you know,

264
00:16:27.381 --> 00:16:30.890
the frozen Tundra and all of that fucking,
you know,

265
00:16:30.891 --> 00:16:35.210
making it seem like it was fucking d day.
All of that great shit that I loved.

266
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:40.310
They are going to transition out of all of that.
And um,

267
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:43.740
I think that there's going to be a lot more futures in,

268
00:16:43.741 --> 00:16:48.741
in teals and all that type of stuff coming into the NFL is they try to,

269
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.430
uh,
I dunno.

270
00:16:51.431 --> 00:16:54.190
I think as they try to get ahead of this next generation of people that call

271
00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:59.280
that's coming up that goes out to comedy clubs and literally just stares at the

272
00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:02.000
comedians.
Like that's what I'm experiencing now.

273
00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.880
I was at the comedy store last night.

274
00:17:03.881 --> 00:17:06.100
Granted something fucked up happened before I went on stage.

275
00:17:06.101 --> 00:17:10.570
I guess they should have realized that.
And uh,
they,
yeah,
just uh,

276
00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:14.030
just staring at me
staring at me.

277
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.950
So I dunno.
I Dunno what I have to do.
You know,

278
00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.450
I'm thinking of actually maybe I'll,

279
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.930
I'll start wearing pink on stage and then people will think that I care.

280
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.990
Um,
anyways,
I don't want to get,
I don't want to fucking,

281
00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:37.250
I don't want to call out any fucking specific fucking people.

282
00:17:37.251 --> 00:17:38.750
I don't want to fucking do that cause you know,

283
00:17:38.751 --> 00:17:41.450
I sucked as a comedian eventually.
I got better at it,
but I mean,

284
00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:46.110
Jesus fucking Christ.
If you're going to go down that road,

285
00:17:46.111 --> 00:17:50.160
you still have to pick somebody that's of a fucking certain level of

286
00:17:50.161 --> 00:17:53.910
professionalism though.
If you're going to have a fucking national game,

287
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.330
I mean Jesus Christ,

288
00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:01.020
and I'm not talking about that poor bastard that froze like a deer in a
headlight

289
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.360
that fuck your kid on the side.
I just felt bad for that too.

290
00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.960
You know what I mean?
But I'm just saying,
you know,

291
00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:08.700
if you're going to call a fucking game,

292
00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:14.980
good fuck it Lord.
Good Lord.

293
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.920
Um,
this is actually my dream.

294
00:18:17.921 --> 00:18:22.921
My dream is somebody that like is like a fucking went to broadcasting school and

295
00:18:23.171 --> 00:18:25.000
then you pair them up with someone that played the game.

296
00:18:25.001 --> 00:18:26.560
I know they tried to do that all the time,

297
00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.680
but someone that actually can tell a story that played the fucking gate,

298
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:34.210
that's when it's the best.
Like Collins Worth.
John Madden,

299
00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:37.960
Phil,
I love a lot of people.
Didn't like Phil saying,
I love Phil Simms,

300
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.410
the Guy Fucking,
you won a super bowl.
He's the first guy to say,

301
00:18:41.411 --> 00:18:43.390
I'm going to Disneyland.
I'm not going to listen to this guy.

302
00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.200
All these guys who play fantasy football trying to say the guy doesn't know what

303
00:18:47.201 --> 00:18:49.300
he's talking about.
Yeah.
What would he know about?
Well,
you know,

304
00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:52.000
he only played the game professionally.
You fucking moron.

305
00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.680
<v 1>Um,
I dunno.</v>

306
00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.460
<v 0>Wait a second.
What the fuck is going on here?</v>

307
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.050
All right.
I don't know what the Hell I just did.
I had my recorder on the floor.

308
00:19:09.051 --> 00:19:10.850
I don't know when the hell I just chopped it off,

309
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.250
but I had the thing recording on the wrong speed.

310
00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:20.520
I Dunno what the fuck happened.
Anyways,
I don't fuck,

311
00:19:20.521 --> 00:19:22.530
I don't know what's going on.
What's going on in comedy clubs.

312
00:19:22.531 --> 00:19:25.020
I don't know what's going on.
And in the NFL,

313
00:19:25.021 --> 00:19:26.700
I don't know what the fuck they're doing and this is just,

314
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.320
is just part of becoming old.

315
00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.800
Like why do I got to put their street lights up so bright?

316
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:35.050
Like I'm just an old man.
Don't fucking listen to me.

317
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.113
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

318
00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.370
<v 0>Anyways,
I don't understand how I had a half hour to do this before nine o'clock.</v>

319
00:19:40.371 --> 00:19:41.390
And it's almost nine o'clock,

320
00:19:41.391 --> 00:19:45.740
and I only have fucking 20 minutes done probably because I stepped on the

321
00:19:45.741 --> 00:19:48.770
recorder and I
the fucking worst.

322
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.940
I'm the worst anyways.
So congratulations to the NFL.

323
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:56.840
I know you guys want to go global.
I hope you fucking do it.
Um,

324
00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:58.251
you know,

325
00:19:58.251 --> 00:20:01.700
I'm sure you're jealous of the UFC that started way after you guys and they were

326
00:20:01.701 --> 00:20:06.590
able to do it.
You are sure.
Um,
you know,

327
00:20:06.591 --> 00:20:10.940
I don't know what the fuck to tell you.
I Dunno what the fuck to tell you.

328
00:20:10.941 --> 00:20:15.260
It's just like,
I don't,
I,
uh,
I kind of like college football.

329
00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.290
I'm gonna start watching that and then eventually they're going to get pressure

330
00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:24.490
to fucking make this game a male testosterone game.

331
00:20:25.011 --> 00:20:29.340
For some reason.
We need a bunch of estrogen in it.
You know,

332
00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:32.820
this is what I don't understand about women.
Okay.

333
00:20:32.821 --> 00:20:36.570
Every study says that they're way smarter than men.
Right?

334
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:39.150
They can handle a stronger level of pain.

335
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.680
They're more in touch with their emotions.
They could do all of that shit.

336
00:20:43.681 --> 00:20:47.560
And you know,
for them,
far as my experience goes,
I'd agree with it.

337
00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:52.340
For the most part,
I dunno about the arrogant.
We're smarter than you.

338
00:20:52.341 --> 00:20:55.280
It depends on what the fuck you talking about.
Right?
But I'll give you,

339
00:20:55.281 --> 00:20:58.550
I'll give you all of that,
but at that's all true.
What if fuck kid,

340
00:20:58.551 --> 00:21:01.970
you start your own sports league.
Why don't you do that?

341
00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:03.113
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

342
00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.320
<v 0>What do you constantly have to fucking infiltrate some shit?</v>

343
00:21:06.321 --> 00:21:08.960
A bunch of guys doing some shit that you know,

344
00:21:08.961 --> 00:21:10.820
at the end of the day you think it's fucking stupid.

345
00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:13.670
It's a bunch of guys smashing into each other's scrambling.

346
00:21:13.810 --> 00:21:18.810
They're fucking brains trying to get a ball crossed the fucking line to score

347
00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:23.310
points.
You know,
you don't give a shit about that.

348
00:21:23.311 --> 00:21:28.311
Why can't they come up with their own Goddamn fucking sports league and then

349
00:21:28.951 --> 00:21:31.800
from top to bottom,
fucking can be all women.

350
00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.090
Then you turn that thing into a global billion dollar fucking entity and then

351
00:21:36.091 --> 00:21:38.310
women get all that fucking money.
There's your power,

352
00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:45.980
fucking join a guy's league and then they give you a pink flags to throw holding

353
00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:50.060
off offense.
Like,
why would you do that?
I don't know.

354
00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:54.560
I don't fucking know.
I don't know.
I don't understand these things.

355
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:58.960
All I can,
all I can do is we equate it to my life is I can tell you this.

356
00:21:58.961 --> 00:22:03.590
When I worked for somebody else,
let's see.
I like the fuck overs.

357
00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:05.950
You can't,
you can't keep a,
you can't keep track of them.

358
00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:10.260
That's when you get stolen from the most.

359
00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.420
That's when you dream gets crushed the most.

360
00:22:12.421 --> 00:22:15.120
When you fucking work for somebody else.
If you work for yourself,

361
00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.820
you have more control.
Granted,
you work way more hours,

362
00:22:17.821 --> 00:22:21.570
but that's the price you pay.
We're taking collars.
Um,
all right.

363
00:22:21.571 --> 00:22:26.340
Let me read a little bit of advertising here.
Everybody.
Um,
by the way,

364
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:30.900
a fucking oh Billy,
no fun,
no booze.
28 days,

365
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:36.090
28 days a week.
I don't fucking booze.

366
00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.310
28 days a week.
I stare at the ceiling,

367
00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.700
tried to go to sleep.
Oh,

368
00:22:44.701 --> 00:22:49.620
I loved that whiskey.
It's my Tylenol pm.
Um,

369
00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.440
speaking of which,
this is going to be the biggest test for my air quotes.

370
00:22:55.441 --> 00:22:59.580
Sobriety.
I'm not fucking sober.
I'm just not drinking.
Okay.
All right.

371
00:22:59.581 --> 00:23:03.060
This is the biggest test.
Saucy thoughtfully me.

372
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:04.920
Y'All guys saucy.

373
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:09.240
Everyone at some point has wished they could just have beer,
wine,

374
00:23:09.241 --> 00:23:11.820
or liquor delivered.
Well,

375
00:23:11.821 --> 00:23:15.660
someone finally decided to do something about it.
Oh my God.
I love these people.

376
00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.600
Next,
please mention all the talking points below.
Dude,

377
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:23.310
I'll fucking sing these if you want to.
Want me to.
Introducing thoughts.

378
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.380
See me out.

379
00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:30.400
The alcohol delivering app thought they around or delivers your favorite wine

380
00:23:30.481 --> 00:23:33.780
and beer and liquor right to your door on demand.

381
00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:37.860
It's Uber for alcohol.
This is great.

382
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:42.060
This is fucking great.
Uber's great,
right?

383
00:23:42.061 --> 00:23:45.500
I should say lift cause they fucking advertise on us,
right?
Oh,
I love those.

384
00:23:45.501 --> 00:23:49.460
Those those guys at Lyft and the ladies,
right?
They fucking,

385
00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:52.100
yeah,
they cut down on drinking and driving.

386
00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:56.930
Right now they're going to cut down on fucking ruin in the ozone layer.

387
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.770
Well I guess some stores to drive liquor store,
drive it over to you.
Whatever.

388
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:02.330
All I know is you're not in the street,
dude.

389
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:06.920
You turn your fucking apartment into the club.
You never leave.

390
00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:12.080
They never shut you off.
This is great.
Okay.
Now,
if you're in Los Angeles,

391
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.490
San Francisco,
Chicago,
San Diego,

392
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.720
whale's Vagina or Sacramento,

393
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.070
you're thought the order will arrive at your door in 30 minutes or less.

394
00:24:22.071 --> 00:24:26.840
Ready to drink.
All right guys.

Chicago,
San Diego,
Sacramento,

396
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:34.010
You've got to get these people the money that they need to expand.
All right,

397
00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:39.080
for the right,
this is like the original six except as five cities first,
okay?

398
00:24:39.081 --> 00:24:41.780
For the rest of us thought that will deliver beer,
wine,

399
00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:44.990
and liquor to your door in two days or less nationwide.

400
00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:49.130
There are no minimums,
no order minimums,
no delivery fees,

401
00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:52.760
no running to the store.

You go out,

421
00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:18.320
Draft Kings has organized players into eight tiers.

All you have to do is select one player from each tier.

423
00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:24.620
Choose between the public,

548
00:34:45.841 --> 00:34:48.930
she,
they asked you what's something you always carry around with you?

Like I said it now they're going to like me.
This is how out of touch she is.

563
00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:42.300
She literally thinks that.
She just has to say,

Um,
hot rods.

571
00:36:09.100 --> 00:36:13.240
I've always liked hot rods.
Fucking shameless.
This is the thing about like,

572
00:36:13.241 --> 00:36:16.830
when you're at her level of fucking wealth,
which is really you,

573
00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:19.900
I don't know how you explain it.
You know,
when her husband,
you know,

574
00:36:19.901 --> 00:36:24.640
had the highest office in public office and you will,
he is president,

575
00:36:24.641 --> 00:36:26.080
you only make four,
500 grand a year.

576
00:36:26.081 --> 00:36:28.390
Somehow they through their daughter a $3 million wedding.
I mean,

577
00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.160
how does the math work there?

578
00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:31.780
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

579
00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:36.640
<v 0>They had the fuck she is the fucking devil.
I'm telling you.
You know,</v>

580
00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:41.110
oh my God,
what a fucking selection this year.
Can you fucking believe this shit?

581
00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:43.390
A reality show star.

582
00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:45.280
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

583
00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.080
<v 0>You know who's sitting there with that fucking,</v>

584
00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:48.430
I don't know what the other guy's name is.

585
00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.480
Then talking about the size of their hands.
They haven't had did size.

586
00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:56.490
He addict debate running for office.
You got Hillary.

587
00:36:56.491 --> 00:36:59.280
You fucking write it.
I'll say it.
She doesn't give a fuck.

588
00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:02.540
This is why I gotta be honest with you.

589
00:37:02.541 --> 00:37:06.740
Why I like Republicans better than Democrats because the Republicans at least

590
00:37:06.741 --> 00:37:08.420
have the decency to just show,

591
00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:12.140
to openly show you that they don't give a fuck about you and Democrats,

592
00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.240
they actually try to act like they give a fuck how people,

593
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:18.830
but people that work for a fucking living,
they don't do the same fucking people.

594
00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.860
They just lie about it.
You know?
I swear to God,

595
00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:25.910
if Bernie Sanders would just fucking go the whole way,

596
00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.670
you know what I mean?
Don't stop and Kuwait,

597
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:34.820
you gotta go all the way to Baghdad with these fucking bankers.
Okay?

598
00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.840
That's what you gotta do.

599
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:39.440
You gotta tip over the statute when you got to have all those top level bankers

600
00:37:39.620 --> 00:37:42.260
swinging at the end of a rope.
That's the only way to stay.

601
00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:43.430
You got to start over again.

602
00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:50.000
That's my candidate.
None of them are saying that.
So it,
it's over.

603
00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:52.610
And I know you'd think it built,
you don't know shit.

604
00:37:52.611 --> 00:37:55.250
And you read conspiracy theory and you know what I say to that?

605
00:37:55.290 --> 00:38:00.110
You're absolutely right.
Okay.
All right,
let's move on.

606
00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:05.270
That was,
uh,
that was,
uh,
that was political comedy right there.
A few.

607
00:38:05.271 --> 00:38:09.350
If you're wondering what that was supposed to be,
she goes to little Italy.

608
00:38:09.351 --> 00:38:12.770
What do you always have in your purse?
A jar of Marinara sauce.

609
00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:16.940
Who's your favorite singer?
Dean Martin.

610
00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:23.570
Oh my God.
Did you see the house?
She looked like she rolled her eyes.

611
00:38:23.571 --> 00:38:26.540
I don't want to put like shit on her.
That's what she fucking did.

612
00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:27.803
<v 1>Okay.</v>

613
00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:31.170
<v 0>That's how out of touch she is.
Hillary Clinton thinks black.</v>

614
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:35.230
All black people walk around with hot sauce in their purse because white people

615
00:38:35.231 --> 00:38:38.080
don't know how to season food.
Um,

616
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:41.380
I'm not saying there aren't some black people did do that.
You know what I mean?

617
00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:44.440
But that would also be people who aren't white,

618
00:38:44.441 --> 00:38:48.190
who look at white people and think we're all in the upper 1% standing on a yacht

619
00:38:48.191 --> 00:38:52.240
shooting the shit with one of the Kennedy's and they're fucking weird in Brent

620
00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.950
inbred dentition.
I never understood the Kennedys.
I,
they,

621
00:38:56.170 --> 00:39:00.070
they're from Mike the nose up.
They're really good looking people,
great hair,

622
00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:03.730
you know,
nice fucking big five head,
you know,

623
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:07.210
it looks great on TV,
decent eyes,
you know,

624
00:39:07.211 --> 00:39:09.700
and then you just get to that for you get to those,
those,

625
00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.490
I mean it was getting old.
They look like from the nose down,

626
00:39:12.491 --> 00:39:14.800
they look like Clint Howard.
I don't know what it is.

627
00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:18.190
There's something going on with that family.
You can't,
uh,

628
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:20.680
<v 2>okay.</v>

629
00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:25.000
<v 0>You know what it is,
is they still look ethnic.
They feel,
look at,
um,</v>

630
00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:30.680
if you look at like,
like white people from like,

631
00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:35.510
like look at Joe Dimaggio,
you know,
he's probably considered a good looking guy.

632
00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.070
That guy is fucking deck.

633
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:41.150
I Dunno what happened once everybody got all mixed up.

634
00:39:41.151 --> 00:39:43.790
Like all the fucking national,
I was getting mixed up like,
you know,

635
00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:47.480
started streamlining the looks and people are way better looking now.

636
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:51.530
Don't you think then when you look back in the day,
I mean,
Jesus Christ,

637
00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:55.880
Babe Ruth,
every once in Lou Gehrig was a good looking guy.
You know what I mean?

638
00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.080
But Babe Ruth,
that was a mess.
Joe Dimaggio mess.

639
00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:03.830
I can say what?
Don't bad looking.
I don't know.

640
00:40:03.831 --> 00:40:05.810
I'm just saying when you look at the shit back then,

641
00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:10.990
like an Italian guy looked a hundred percent fucking attack.
I don't want to,

642
00:40:10.991 --> 00:40:12.350
you know something.
And when I went to Italy,

643
00:40:12.351 --> 00:40:14.750
they will better look in the back then,
I don't know what the fuck it was.

644
00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:19.220
We allegedly had better food back then.
People were shorter.

645
00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:21.141
I don't know what it was.

646
00:40:21.141 --> 00:40:23.690
Did you ever notice that when you look back and when you really look at those

647
00:40:23.691 --> 00:40:24.380
old pictures?

648
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.500
I love looking at old pictures and it's like that George Carlin bit,

649
00:40:27.501 --> 00:40:28.760
when you look at it on picture and you're like,

650
00:40:28.761 --> 00:40:32.330
everybody in that picture is dead.
And for some reason in a morbid way,

651
00:40:32.331 --> 00:40:35.900
it's like fascinating.
When I look at those old pictures,
I just,

652
00:40:35.901 --> 00:40:39.380
that's what I think.
Like God damn it.
There was some fucking ugly ass people,

653
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:46.000
you know,
and you know,
it was a game changer was uh,
three things.
Polio,

654
00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:50.830
vaccine,
penicillin and braces.

655
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:56.910
Those three fucking things could just hide so many fucking imperfections.

656
00:40:57.611 --> 00:40:58.444
You know what I mean?

657
00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:00.440
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

658
00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.070
<v 0>And once you get braces,
Jesus Christ,</v>

659
00:41:02.071 --> 00:41:06.150
if you just brush your fucking teeth in remotely,
keep yourself in shape.

660
00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:10.620
You know,
you throw on some nice clothes.
People have no idea where you came from.

661
00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:12.653
<v 2>You know,</v>

662
00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:18.120
<v 0>back in the day,
people,
they saw it on your teeth,
told the whole fucking store.</v>

663
00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:22.810
You just smile and be like,
hi,
I can see you're going to have tuberculosis.

664
00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:26.530
You live in a damp Dag fucking apartment with no fucking windows.

665
00:41:26.531 --> 00:41:30.010
You saw it in their fucking teeth.
Right.
I don't know about,

666
00:41:30.011 --> 00:41:32.590
I heard what's his face?
Jp Morgan had like Rosacea.

667
00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:37.250
Is that how you say it all over his face?
He was just all fucking angry.

668
00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:39.730
Those old school rich guys,
you know,

669
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:42.160
used to walk around with top hats like the Penguin Horn,

670
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:47.020
right when I'm walking down the street.
Um,
is this a podcast anymore?

671
00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:48.440
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Let me,

672
00:41:48.441 --> 00:41:50.600
let me do some advertising here and then I'll uh,

673
00:41:50.601 --> 00:41:53.750
I'll get to more babbling here in a moment.
All right.

674
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:59.990
Hot Sauce.
Ah,
shameless fucking shameless.
She looks in,

675
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:01.041
bred her fucking teeth.

676
00:42:01.041 --> 00:42:03.650
There's something going on with her and the sub go with you see how Bill Clinton

677
00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:08.510
collapse now it's like he's a,
like a marionette puppet.
He has his mouth open.

678
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:13.820
Uh,
that's how he made it.
But that smiling with his mouth open.

679
00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:18.500
Oh,
I've got to fix it.
I'll fix everything.

680
00:42:18.590 --> 00:42:21.020
How are you doing?
Call me later.
Oh

681
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:31.723
<v 4>Huh.</v>

682
00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:54.140
Oh,
friend
[inaudible].
Oh,

683
00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:01.150
<v 6>I'm sick of Obama's wife.</v>

684
00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:09.390
This is some Republican rants either.
It's just kind of first ladies in general,

685
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:14.040
you know,
I don't know what it is all throughout my life with each presidency,

686
00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:17.680
like these first ladies,
they've just gotten more and more like,
like,
uh,

687
00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:21.090
like chatty,
you know,
more.

688
00:43:21.091 --> 00:43:23.940
More chime in in like leaning into the frame,

689
00:43:25.590 --> 00:43:29.310
fitting out their ideas.
It's just like,
well,
why are you talking?

690
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:33.900
Right?
You weren't elected.
Shut up.

691
00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:39.390
Your husband's not running a lemonade stand here.
He's running the country.

692
00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:44.820
You don't just Shyman
let me guess.

693
00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:46.380
Is this considered sexist?

694
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:52.150
Why can you just nodded their leg?
Let me ask you this.
All right.

695
00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.340
Let's say you had a leak in your house.
Okay?
You call a plumber up.

696
00:43:55.370 --> 00:43:59.390
He shows up and he goes,
yeah,
I took the leaks coming from the upstairs bathroom.

697
00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:02.960
We need to shut it off.
Then all of a sudden his wife walks in.
Who is it?

698
00:44:02.961 --> 00:44:06.540
A plumber.
Okay.

699
00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.970
Why don't you be like,
with all due respect,
shut the,

700
00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:14.280
I need a plumber in this moment.

701
00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:20.000
[inaudible] sending all of branch here.
All right.

702
00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:24.310
At some point there's going to be the first female president,
right?

703
00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.210
Exactly.
At that moment.

704
00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:31.320
You're going to have the first male first lady,

705
00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:32.523
<v 4>right?</v>

706
00:44:33.660 --> 00:44:36.810
<v 6>When that happens,
that too needs to shut his trap.</v>

707
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:41.250
I don't want to hear a word out of him.
I want to hear from the president.
You,

708
00:44:41.251 --> 00:44:43.140
sir,
go do some first lady stuff.

709
00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:44.123
<v 4>All right.</v>

710
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:47.130
<v 6>Get yourself some gloves that go up to your elbows.</v>

711
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:50.190
Smile and nod during speeches.

712
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:54.480
Go put your own flair.
Redecorated the White House.

713
00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:56.413
<v 4>Hi,</v>

714
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:58.780
<v 6>I'm Michelle Obama right now.</v>

715
00:44:58.781 --> 00:45:03.280
She's sitting there holding up those hashtags from that Hashtag bring back our

716
00:45:03.281 --> 00:45:07.780
girls.
It's like,
I blew my mind.
It's like,
why are you showing me that?

717
00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:13.840
I'm a stand up comedian,
like what am I going to do to get those curls back?

718
00:45:13.841 --> 00:45:16.420
Why don't you look across the dinner table?
It's like you see that

719
00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:23.120
<v 4>[inaudible] that is the leader of the free world.
Tell them to pick up a phone,</v>

721
00:45:24.490 --> 00:45:28.610

<v 6>I'll tell you what kills me.
Hillary Clinton might run.
She might.</v>

726
00:45:45.511 --> 00:45:48.390
She might run that.
That blows my mind.
I mean on,
she became a senator.

727
00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.570
She went from being the president's wife to be in a senator just like that

728
00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.433
lateral move.

729
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:55.980
That's like Tom Brady's wife become the next quarterback of the ramps.

730
00:45:57.790 --> 00:45:58.530
<v 4>It's like what?</v>

731
00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:01.650
<v 6>Yeah,
hanging out.
You just pick it up.</v>

732
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:06.210
I stopped in sports and then I bank Tom Brady and I don't know what happened.

733
00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:09.330
I just picked up a ball.
I started liking it.

734
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:12.450
I'm leading receivers was incredible.

735
00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:18.510
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

736
00:46:18.510 --> 00:46:19.860
<v 6>I knew it was going to be like this.</v>

737
00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:23.613
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

738
00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:42.083
Hey,

739
00:46:46.810 --> 00:46:47.520
what's going on?

740
00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:50.280
<v 7>Is Bill Burn.
This is the Monday morning podcast on Monday,</v>

741
00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:54.360
September 14th,
2009.
Um,

742
00:46:55.930 --> 00:46:57.420
it's like fucking 10 20 at night.

743
00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:00.120
I finally got some time to do the podcast today.

744
00:47:00.121 --> 00:47:04.860
I was flying back from Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania.
I lost my cell phone.

745
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.340
You know,
once again,
I lost another cell phone.

746
00:47:08.341 --> 00:47:10.170
Every time I get a nice cell phone,
I lose him.

747
00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:13.300
So I just reactivated my little flip phone.

748
00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:17.230
Those of you who go on to bill.com when you listen to my podcast,

749
00:47:17.231 --> 00:47:19.490
you see that picture of me right there.
Okay.

750
00:47:19.690 --> 00:47:24.460
Looking down at the bar and that little 15 year old chicks flip phone that I got

751
00:47:24.461 --> 00:47:27.880
there.
That's what I'm back to.
I went from a blackberry to that thing,

752
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:31.400
you know,
you know,

753
00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:36.420
just once I would like to lose a fucking phone and call it and if someone on the

754
00:47:36.491 --> 00:47:39.910
other end be my savior,
be like,
why?
Yes,
yes.

755
00:47:39.911 --> 00:47:43.600
I have found your phone and I would love to return it to you.

756
00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:48.100
There is nothing more I would like to do.
The return is you now free of charge,

757
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:50.560
free of charge.
That's what happens.
Everybody else,
I know,

758
00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:54.820
he told my girlfriend loses her cell phone.
She calls up,
she just,
you know,

759
00:47:54.910 --> 00:47:58.510
oh my God,
I left my cell phone and then she just picks up Mike.
She goes,

760
00:47:58.511 --> 00:48:00.730
let me use your phone.
And then she just goes,
you know,

761
00:48:00.731 --> 00:48:04.390
rings like twice and it's always the nicest person ever on the other line.

762
00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:09.670
She's like,
Hey,
yeah,
yeah,
it is my thank you.
Oh,

763
00:48:09.671 --> 00:48:11.720
that's awesome.
Okay,
great.

764
00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:15.940
I can write and then I'm driving her somewhere to go pick the fucking thing up.

765
00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:20.500
That never happens for me.
It just rings and rings and rings.

766
00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:23.380
And then I just hear my voicemail,
hey,
this is bill.

767
00:48:23.381 --> 00:48:25.930
You've reached my cell phone that you're never going to fucking see again.

768
00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:30.040
Please leave a message and you might want to call variety,
you know,

769
00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:35.340
call fucking Verizon and have shutoff is for somebody calls Trinidad on this

770
00:48:36.701 --> 00:48:41.530
goddamn thing.
Fuck.
So that was my day.

771
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:45.520
This is how old I am too.
You know what?
When I was flying out here,
there was a,

772
00:48:45.521 --> 00:48:49.990
there was nobody sitting next to me and actually was fell asleep,
you know,

773
00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:52.750
laying down on the row.
And when I woke up,

774
00:48:52.751 --> 00:48:57.010
like I felt like my lower body dislocated from my upper body.

775
00:48:57.011 --> 00:49:01.370
It wasn't even like my back hurt.
It was just like I fell.

776
00:49:01.450 --> 00:49:02.860
He got hit by a fucking car.

777
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:06.400
It's been a brutal day is what I'm trying to say people,

778
00:49:06.401 --> 00:49:08.050
but maybe we can in Philly was awesome.

779
00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:11.260
So many people showed up so people showed up.
We added a show.

780
00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:15.460
That's never happened to me,
you know?
So I want to thank everybody.

781
00:49:15.461 --> 00:49:18.250
Before I get going on this long rambling podcast here,

782
00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:21.250
I want to thank everybody in Philadelphia.
Came out to see me.

783
00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:26.230
I had a great time and I was working there with the Joe to Rosa,

784
00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:28.240
the a teen idol,

785
00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:32.560
the new hot shot teen idol on the opiate Anthony Show was opening up for me.

786
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:34.023
And uh,

787
00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:38.530
all my God did the Raiders just score a fucking touchdown is a no flag.

788
00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:43.240
Holy Shit.
Are they finally going to beat the charges?

789
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:49.330
Okay.
I don't want to ruin you guys.
Who Anybody Tivo the fucking game.

790
00:49:49.331 --> 00:49:52.360
They just went up 1917 with two 34 left.

791
00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:56.050
You know,
it's funny,
I was supposed to have a bet,
you know,

792
00:49:56.051 --> 00:50:00.220
I'm a patriots fan and I was supposed to bet these guys shred and Reagan out in

793
00:50:00.221 --> 00:50:01.090
Buffalo,
right?

794
00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:05.650
I made him a $50 bet last year when Tom Brady went down that they are patriots

795
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:07.960
are going to make the playoffs because they were saying that they were done.

796
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:13.030
So if the Patriots didn't make the playoffs,
I own both 50 bucks.
But if I won,

797
00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:18.180
they had to read a written apology to bill Belicheck that I wrote and they had

798
00:50:18.251 --> 00:50:21.580
to read it on the air.
We went 11 and five but we didn't make it.

799
00:50:21.581 --> 00:50:24.610
So I owed them 50 bucks,
but I never went to buffalo and I can never pay him.

800
00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:29.720
So Lo and behold,
the first game of the season,
we're playing buffalo.
So I go,
hey,

801
00:50:29.721 --> 00:50:32.960
let's go double or nothing,
you know,
and they wouldn't touch it.

802
00:50:33.590 --> 00:50:38.510
They would not touch the fucking game on air.
I was like,
dude,

803
00:50:38.511 --> 00:50:40.880
the worst you could do is break even.
And then they still,

804
00:50:40.881 --> 00:50:43.640
they still wouldn't back their own team and look at the fucking game.

805
00:50:43.641 --> 00:50:46.880
They actually almost won it.
They actually did win it.
They just blew the game.

806
00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:51.860
But uh,
so I'm glad,
I'm glad I saved myself.

807
00:50:51.861 --> 00:50:55.190
50 bucks each shred and Reagan,
if you're listening to this,
you guys pumped out.

808
00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.950
And you know,
it's funny was when I got off the plane,

809
00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:01.940
I actually got a message from one of the guys that works there trying to get me

810
00:51:01.941 --> 00:51:04.490
to call in at the last second.

811
00:51:04.491 --> 00:51:09.170
I bet a lot of their listeners called them punks for not taking the bed.
And uh,

812
00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:12.170
unfortunately I lost my cell phone or I would've called in,

813
00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:16.280
but it worked out for me.
Um,

814
00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:21.710
I'm too fucking frazzled to do this guys.
I really am.
I can't fucking do this,

815
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:26.150
but I got to get this done because I got too much shit to do tomorrow usually.

816
00:51:26.151 --> 00:51:28.400
And I enjoy doing the podcast.
It's usually in the morning.

817
00:51:28.401 --> 00:51:32.330
I'm usually screaming and I'm having a good fucking time,
but now it's late.

818
00:51:32.540 --> 00:51:33.530
My dog's asleep.

819
00:51:33.531 --> 00:51:37.550
My downstairs neighbors asleep downstairs neighbor doesn't like us.

820
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:41.180
We have hardwood floors and my girlfriend has high heel shoes.

821
00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:45.440
So you can do the math on that one.
Let's just get,
let's just cut to the chase.

822
00:51:45.441 --> 00:51:50.230
You guys mind if I do a short one this week?
Yeah.
Well to fucking bed.
Um,

823
00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:53.570
let me,
let me give you some happy shit because this isn't going to be happy.

824
00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:57.470
I'm fucking exhausted.
Let me give you some youtube videos to watch this week.

825
00:51:57.530 --> 00:52:00.650
All right.
This first one,
um,

826
00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:04.850
I stumbled across because someone else showed me something else.

827
00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:11.120
Um,
this video which you want to searches,
it says,

828
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:14.360
try not to laugh or say

829
00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:20.220
WTF.
Basically what the fuck.
But you just write WTF all lowercase.

830
00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:25.270
Try not to laugh or say WTF and I'm have a feeling a lot of women won't find it

831
00:52:27.021 --> 00:52:32.021
funny because it's just really like you'd have to be in the seventh grade or a

832
00:52:33.921 --> 00:52:38.300
mail to find this funny.
I can't even explain while it's why it's funny,

833
00:52:38.301 --> 00:52:41.770
but it just makes me laugh my ass off.
But it's,

834
00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:45.230
it's a great video cause you will either laugh or you will say,
what the fuck?

835
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:51.890
Um,
here's another one.
Somebody sent me a search,
gay top gun.

836
00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:56.150
You guys ever seen the movie top gun and you've seen Tarantino going his rent

837
00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:59.330
that it's actually a homo erotic movie.

838
00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:03.580
The way this person edits it is fucking hilarious and a,

839
00:53:03.590 --> 00:53:06.680
I haven't seen the movie.
Oh my God,

840
00:53:06.681 --> 00:53:09.500
I probably am seeing that movie since the late eighties.
You know,

841
00:53:09.590 --> 00:53:14.150
I remember I did.
I see in the movie theaters now.
I think somebody bought it.

842
00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:18.200
Somebody,
my family bought that movie that was actually considered a good movie.

843
00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:22.220
You know,
and uh,
you know,

844
00:53:22.221 --> 00:53:25.500
we had it on VHS so you know,

845
00:53:25.501 --> 00:53:27.680
the usual life of a VHS tape,

846
00:53:27.690 --> 00:53:32.130
it lasted like a fucking year then it was all screwed up from being rewound,

847
00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:36.870
you know,
so I haven't seen that basically since sort of 89 or 90 and uh,

848
00:53:37.110 --> 00:53:38.910
I got to go with Tarantino on that one.

849
00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:43.770
At least the way this Guy Ed is some movie man.
It's fucking,
it's really funny.

850
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:46.800
All right.
The last youtube video you might want to check out.

851
00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:51.830
And this one and I'm just search a dance kick baby.

852
00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:59.370
All right.
Comedian,
last night while I worked at very funny guy told me to uh,

853
00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:02.550
Jeff and I've already forget his last fucking name.
I'm such a moron.

854
00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:07.320
He was hilarious.
So,
uh,
he told me to check this one out.
Dance kicked baby.

855
00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:13.590
Um,
it's,
it's,
I can't say it's funny.
It,

856
00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:17.160
it'll definitely make you put your hand over your mouth.
Um,

857
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:19.650
cause it's not dance kicked baby.

858
00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:23.850
It's not that it's dancing and then a baby gets kicked.

859
00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:27.270
All right.
You want to have anyone see what happens when a toddler gets fucking,

860
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:29.290
just check it out.
All right.

861
00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:33.330
There's a lot of sick fucks are going to look at that one first.
Um,
like I said,

862
00:54:33.331 --> 00:54:35.430
this is going to be real economical,
economical,

863
00:54:35.431 --> 00:54:38.760
whoever the fuck you say at this week.
Uh,
let's plow ahead.

864
00:54:39.180 --> 00:54:43.290
Here's some advice somebody wants.
Listen to this story.
This one really a,

865
00:54:43.470 --> 00:54:46.830
this one really grabbed me here on a lot of levels.
All right,

866
00:54:46.831 --> 00:54:49.170
bill asked bill a bill.

867
00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:52.380
I was at a family birthday party today when some friends of mine,

868
00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:57.610
friends of my dad's showed up with their smoking hot daughter,
uh,

869
00:54:57.850 --> 00:55:00.030
make after making a few glances at each other.

870
00:55:00.210 --> 00:55:03.240
I figured I had a good chance of getting her number.
I went over to her,

871
00:55:03.241 --> 00:55:05.610
my dad introduced us,
we made a little small talk.

872
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:09.330
Her mom then asked if she wanted a piece of cake or anything.

873
00:55:09.331 --> 00:55:13.230
So I decided to be a fucking gentleman and offered to get her a piece.

874
00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:18.690
So I come back with the slice of cake in hand only to see my brother.

875
00:55:18.750 --> 00:55:20.730
And he's written this in capital letters,
so you know,

876
00:55:20.731 --> 00:55:24.810
this isn't going to go anywhere good.
He goes,
I come back only to see my brother,

877
00:55:25.290 --> 00:55:28.700
capital letters talking to her,
um,

878
00:55:28.750 --> 00:55:33.330
and already getting her number on the guys that she's interested in getting into

879
00:55:33.331 --> 00:55:36.990
law enforcement and he happens to be a cop.
Uh,

880
00:55:36.991 --> 00:55:40.080
that pretty much canceled me out since there's no way I was going to pull the

881
00:55:40.081 --> 00:55:44.040
same shit in which both brothers ask her for her number.
Yeah,

882
00:55:44.041 --> 00:55:46.010
that would've been creepy.
So he goes,
uh,

883
00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:50.610
I handed the cake and the three of us talk some more until her parents decided

884
00:55:50.611 --> 00:55:55.080
to leave since it was towards the end of the party already.
Um,

885
00:55:55.110 --> 00:55:59.460
after that,
after they left,
I immediately told my brother,
you know,

886
00:55:59.461 --> 00:56:02.550
walked up to my brother and I told him what the fuck.

887
00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:05.940
Since everybody could tell I was trying to get our number.

888
00:56:06.210 --> 00:56:08.190
He joked along with my,

889
00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:11.580
what does that u n d e s

890
00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:17.460
I don't know what that word means.
Um,
he drew all my uncles.
I couldn't read that.

891
00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:22.140
Sorry.
This volumes up way too high.
Here.
Let me turn this thing down.
Sorry.
Um,

892
00:56:23.110 --> 00:56:24.430
record level.

893
00:56:28.330 --> 00:56:31.120
I don't know.
I don't know how to fucking do that on the fly to it.

894
00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:36.460
Does that work?
That's better.
Hello?
No,
it's still fucked up.
All right.
Whatever.

895
00:56:36.461 --> 00:56:39.130
I'll hold the mic away from me.
Told you guys,
this one's going to be brutal.

896
00:56:39.131 --> 00:56:43.640
I'm exhausted.
Um,
anyways,
so egos.
Yeah.

897
00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:45.490
So I went up to him.
I said,
what the fuck?

898
00:56:46.450 --> 00:56:48.190
Since everyone could tell I was trying to get her number.

899
00:56:48.191 --> 00:56:53.191
He joked along with my uncles saying she's 26 and uh,

900
00:56:53.620 --> 00:56:57.700
I guess he's 20.
And his brother,
the cop is 21.

901
00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:00.760
So he choked her with his uncle,
said,
come on man,
she's 26.

902
00:57:00.761 --> 00:57:05.500
She's out of your league.
And that he beat me to it.
I figured,
yeah,

903
00:57:05.501 --> 00:57:07.690
I guess he did and didn't.
Uh,

904
00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:13.600
so I did make a big deal or anything after that.

905
00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:15.850
Since I'm not a little bitch,
who's going to cry about it?

906
00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:19.570
I'm going to cry about some torts number.
However,

907
00:57:19.571 --> 00:57:23.380
I still thought it was fucked up.
If it had been the other way around,

908
00:57:23.381 --> 00:57:25.300
I would've just let my brother do his thing.

909
00:57:25.301 --> 00:57:30.040
I guess it comes down to the bar scene where if you step away to get a bitch a

910
00:57:30.041 --> 00:57:34.780
drink,
you're leaving the field pretty much open for anybody else.
I don't know.

911
00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:39.970
Do you think it was a fucked up move or just part of the game?
Uh,

912
00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.660
thanks and hope to see you on stage soon.
Um,

913
00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:48.580
well what do I think about that?
Ah,
all right.

914
00:57:48.581 --> 00:57:50.260
I don't want to blame the victim here,

915
00:57:50.500 --> 00:57:55.500
but what I learned in that letter is that your brother's kind of a dick.

916
00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:58.473
You know,

917
00:57:59.530 --> 00:58:03.880
it's kind of a Dick move and uh,
you know,

918
00:58:03.881 --> 00:58:05.680
I wouldn't have done that to my brother,
but you know,

919
00:58:05.681 --> 00:58:06.720
he's doing it to you that that's,

920
00:58:06.721 --> 00:58:10.990
that's a dick move and you live with the guy so you know he's a Dick.

921
00:58:11.770 --> 00:58:14.950
You know what I mean?
And you kind of answered the question.
Yeah.
You never,

922
00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:20.590
you never leave.
First of all,
even if you know,
even if he didn't come over,

923
00:58:20.591 --> 00:58:22.630
you're already setting up the relationship that you know,

924
00:58:22.631 --> 00:58:27.040
you're just going to be fetching her stuff,
offering her,
you know,
or you call,

925
00:58:27.041 --> 00:58:30.070
do you want me to get you a blanket?
You know,
you don't wanna be that guy.

926
00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:34.300
You know
your brother.
I don't know.

927
00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:37.670
I really want to make fun of the fact that he went to law enforcement a,

928
00:58:37.671 --> 00:58:40.660
let me teach you how to be a cop.
All right?
This is how your Frist,
somebody,

929
00:58:40.690 --> 00:58:44.140
you know,
but believe me,
you use what you got.

930
00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:47.680
You think I have never met her fucking good looking girl.
And I said,
uh,
you know,

931
00:58:47.681 --> 00:58:52.681
worked away in that I was a comedian and an invited her to his show her in one

932
00:58:52.721 --> 00:58:56.710
of her friends hoping desperately she would only show up by herself so I could

933
00:58:56.711 --> 00:59:01.030
try and fucking banger.
So I can't get mad at him for that.
Um,
yeah,

934
00:59:01.031 --> 00:59:04.270
in the future I would just,
I just wouldn't do that shit around your brother.

935
00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:07.990
That's a really asshole thing and I think you need to get them back somehow.

936
00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:12.580
I want to,
I want a story of revenge from you.
That's what I want.

937
00:59:12.581 --> 00:59:16.180
But at the end of the day,
do the chicks fucking 26 years old and you know,

938
00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:20.530
she's got a 21 year old trying to figure out our future,
you know,

939
00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:23.900
she's a loser and plus,
you know,
just the way you were talking about it,
you know,

940
00:59:23.901 --> 00:59:26.540
I learned a,
you know,
you never leave a bitch alone.

941
00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:30.860
He just wanted to fuck her anyways.
Right.
So whatever lesson learned,

942
00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:35.600
lesson learned and to use the top gun analogy,
your brother is now,

943
00:59:35.601 --> 00:59:39.800
he's not a wing man.
He's not a good wing.
So fuck that guy.
And uh,

944
00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:42.590
I dunno,
you know what she could do,

945
00:59:42.591 --> 00:59:46.280
this is something I used to do way back in the day when I was in Boston and I

946
00:59:46.281 --> 00:59:49.490
used to go to this place,
daisy Buchanan's on Newbury street,

947
00:59:49.491 --> 00:59:52.190
which was a total fucking meat market and I'm sure it's still is.

948
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:54.680
I used to go in there with a,

949
00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:59.090
with a couple friends of mine and you know,
going there,
you know,

950
00:59:59.091 --> 01:00:01.730
I have a couple of drinks and just start talking shit to girls or whatever.

951
01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:05.750
Trying to fucking hook up cause God knows that's easy to have three guys.

952
01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:07.400
That's always a nice magic number.

953
01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:13.220
No wonder we never hooked up.
But we used to go in there

954
01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.140
and I forgot what you call it,
dropping bombs.
I can't remember what it was,

955
01:00:18.141 --> 01:00:20.600
but basically you wouldn't cock block,

956
01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:23.510
but she would definitely fuck with your friend.
If he was,

957
01:00:23.511 --> 01:00:25.640
you'd see them hitting on a girl and it was going well.

958
01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:30.650
You'd walk up to them and you would just make up some detail about his life.

959
01:00:30.651 --> 01:00:34.040
That would be embarrassing,
that he would have to somehow play off.

960
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:38.150
Um,
unless she got serious.
And you really got mad.

961
01:00:38.151 --> 01:00:41.780
Like a buddy of mine did one time and mentioned that a friend of mine was still

962
01:00:41.781 --> 01:00:45.680
living in the basement with his mom.
That's what he said.

963
01:00:45.681 --> 01:00:47.630
He had just got done striking out.

964
01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:52.940
So then he came walking up all hammered and he's like,
Oh yeah,
this guy was,

965
01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:54.290
fuck this guy was one of these dudes.

966
01:00:54.291 --> 01:00:58.160
You know all those guys who like who look up at the ceiling when they talk.

967
01:00:58.161 --> 01:01:02.330
And he was one of those guys and he just came walking up and that's what he
said.

968
01:01:02.650 --> 01:01:04.300
He goes,
Oh yeah,
yeah,
you like this guy.

969
01:01:04.510 --> 01:01:06.910
Hey did you mentioned that you still live at home with your parents?

970
01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:14.420
He said it really angry.
You know what else this guy did?
That's a classic story.

971
01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:17.060
I can't believe we never fucking told us we were in days if we can is one night.

972
01:01:17.061 --> 01:01:19.790
Right.
And it was just one of those nights,
you know,

973
01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.630
I dunno what we would talk in.
The women were responding,
we were like,
Holy Shit,

974
01:01:23.631 --> 01:01:28.130
this is going great full once because believe me,
we did not do well.

975
01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:32.330
There's a reason I had to get on a stage and act like a jackass.
Okay.
So,
uh,

976
01:01:32.331 --> 01:01:32.991
I don't know what happened.

977
01:01:32.991 --> 01:01:37.550
Met this group of girls and it was going great and we're all having a good time.

978
01:01:37.551 --> 01:01:41.630
And everybody kind of paired off,
everybody was vibing,
right?
And um,

979
01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:44.090
all of a sudden you just felt the whole energy,

980
01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:48.590
energy of the bar just look towards the front door,
who was like somebody,

981
01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:51.110
you know,
famous or something was going on.
You know,

982
01:01:51.111 --> 01:01:52.970
like when all of a sudden there's like a commotion,

983
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:57.470
everybody just looks in that direction,
right?
So it was weird.

984
01:01:57.471 --> 01:02:00.530
Everybody just sort of collectively looked at the doors like a wave that went

985
01:02:00.531 --> 01:02:01.880
across the room every second.

986
01:02:01.881 --> 01:02:05.150
Everybody felt the energy just looked in the direction you felt the energy

987
01:02:05.151 --> 01:02:07.880
coming from.
And we look over at the door and I swear to God,

988
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:13.490
what the fuck just happened?
San Diego just scored Jesus Christ.

989
01:02:13.491 --> 01:02:18.140
Fucking Raiders.
God Damn fucking guys.

990
01:02:18.141 --> 01:02:23.080
Just can they ever be San Diego?
All right,
let me plow ahead.
So they fucking,
um,

991
01:02:24.850 --> 01:02:28.780
everybody just goes and looks at the door and we look over and there's this guy

992
01:02:28.781 --> 01:02:33.160
dressed like Elvis
fucking Elvis impersonator.

993
01:02:33.730 --> 01:02:37.240
This is the most bizarre cock block I have got this guy standing of course like

994
01:02:37.241 --> 01:02:40.300
fat Elvis,
some comic did that joke.
Nobody,

995
01:02:40.301 --> 01:02:44.680
nobody ever dresses up like the in shape Elvis because no one was ever that good

996
01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:46.840
look.
And they always dress like the fat one or something like that.
Right?

997
01:02:47.110 --> 01:02:49.870
So everyone is it fat Elvis,
he's got the fucking,
you know,

998
01:02:49.871 --> 01:02:52.510
right before he overdosed on pills,
sunglasses on,

999
01:02:53.350 --> 01:02:58.040
and he was doing all these moves to whatever music was on.
Okay.

1000
01:02:58.290 --> 01:03:02.370
And uh,
he fucking like,
every girl in the bar was like,

1001
01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:07.220
oh my God,
they all fucking ran over to the guy.
Right?

1002
01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:09.920
So it was like everything was going great.

1003
01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.610
We're thinking we're going to hook up and next thing you know,
fucking fake.

1004
01:03:13.611 --> 01:03:17.690
Elvis walks in and the girls just runaway and they all run up to the guy because

1005
01:03:17.691 --> 01:03:19.430
they all want to get like their picture taken with them.

1006
01:03:19.431 --> 01:03:22.880
A fucking whatever Chevy guy in the bar were kind of stand like,
I'll duty you.

1007
01:03:22.881 --> 01:03:24.170
Fuck you.
Gotta be kidding me.
Right.

1008
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:29.480
Tell my buddy who looks up at the ceiling he has,
he walks up to the guy,

1009
01:03:30.190 --> 01:03:32.810
you know,
and the guy standing up to and meeting.
Everybody will show up,
man.

1010
01:03:32.811 --> 01:03:35.270
How you doing?
All right.
All right.
Taking care of business.

1011
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:37.490
How are you doing buddy?
He like doing the Elvis sing.

1012
01:03:37.491 --> 01:03:41.330
He's got the fucking leg shaking and everything.
So my buddy goes up there,
right?

1013
01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:44.450
And he starts shaking the guy's hand.
He's like,
what's up man?

1014
01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:48.260
And my buddy's like squeezing his hand,
right?
And he's looking up at the ceiling.

1015
01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:50.890
Yeah,
but the fake Elvis can tell he's pissed.
He's like,
well,

1016
01:03:50.891 --> 01:03:54.130
what's the mind of man?
And my body's just like,
he goes,
hey dude,

1017
01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.100
because like squeeze in his hand.
He goes,
hey buddy,

1018
01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:59.650
why can't you just be yourself?
You know,

1019
01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:03.520
it's like looking up the sale cause why can't you just be yourself?
You know?

1020
01:04:03.850 --> 01:04:04.990
He goes,
I like the red sox.

1021
01:04:04.991 --> 01:04:07.940
I don't come in here dressed like Roger Clemens and the guys that go in,

1022
01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:10.960
he's kind of dropping character going,
all right,
man.
All right,
dude.
All right.

1023
01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:11.410
All right,
look,

1024
01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:14.530
his voice is changing and they start having this fucking handshake fight,

1025
01:04:14.531 --> 01:04:17.950
squeezing each other's hands and they were about ready to go at it.

1026
01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:20.080
And at that point I was like,

1027
01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:23.670
I was going to see the greatest thing ever because my buddy was big.
I was like,

1028
01:04:23.671 --> 01:04:28.530
if he fucking punches this fake Elvis and I see those plastic glasses helicopter

1029
01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:32.520
off of his fucking face,
ah,
please let them be wearing a wig.

1030
01:04:32.521 --> 01:04:35.430
And right before they did it was like you ever see like a Nhl game when the ref

1031
01:04:35.431 --> 01:04:39.030
steps in right before two goons are gonna go at it.
The guy fucking broke it up,

1032
01:04:39.031 --> 01:04:39.960
but it was still good.

1033
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:44.300
My buddy had a fucking handshake fight without Elvis and press Personator.

1034
01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:49.700
It really just broke the guy down.
That's what I loved.
Everyone is like,

1035
01:04:49.701 --> 01:04:53.390
oh my God,
Elvis,
what's going on?
I thought you died.
No,
my end,
I'm always alive.

1036
01:04:53.391 --> 01:04:57.430
He's just playing along.
Oh my God.
Let me get a picture of it.
Okay honey,

1037
01:04:57.980 --> 01:05:00.500
you know he's doing all that shit and then my buddy just comes up.
Hey Dude,

1038
01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:02.750
why can't you just be yourself?

1039
01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:13.300
Ah,
fuck.
Those were some drunk days.
All right,
let's plow ahead.

1040
01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:16.880
What the fuck was I talking about?
Yeah.
You know what,
dude?
MMM.

1041
01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.350
Two things I would tell you when your brother,
first of all,

1042
01:05:20.351 --> 01:05:23.080
don't fucking hit on women.
You're around your fucking country brother.

1043
01:05:23.410 --> 01:05:27.760
And if he does pull some shit like that,
uh,
you know,

1044
01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:29.980
you've got to do something.
This is what you gotta do to that guy.

1045
01:05:29.981 --> 01:05:33.190
What you have to do is the next time he's hitting on a girl,

1046
01:05:33.191 --> 01:05:35.080
you have to deliberately go over and fuck it up.

1047
01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:37.090
You got to figure out some way to fuck it up.

1048
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:42.510
And what you're doing here is you kind of shoot shooting one across the bow just

1049
01:05:43.121 --> 01:05:45.190
to let them know that if he does that shit to you again,

1050
01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:47.530
that there will be like repercussions.
You know what I mean?

1051
01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:51.520
And then just get the fuck away from the guy and continue on.
You know,

1052
01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:54.460
you're doing fine.
Right?
You had no problem walking up to the girl.

1053
01:05:54.570 --> 01:05:59.170
He had a strategy.
You're good.
But yeah,
there's no,
there's no sense.
Dude.

1054
01:05:59.260 --> 01:06:01.720
You're 20 years old,
man,
you're in fucking mint condition.

1055
01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:05.950
He only some fucking 26 year old we need to do with that.
Right?

1056
01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.490
I know you'd fuck her.
Exactly,
but you're not going to marry you,
right?

1057
01:06:09.491 --> 01:06:13.000
You don't have any feelings for so fucking fuck around and fuck your brother

1058
01:06:14.050 --> 01:06:18.850
fucking 20 or 21 year old cop cop were at the mall.
How did he,

1059
01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:23.470
how long do you have to go to school to be a cop?
You know?

1060
01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.080
Anybody else have that like you went to,

1061
01:06:26.290 --> 01:06:30.280
there's a kid in the grade above you and he's like the biggest maniac ever and

1062
01:06:30.281 --> 01:06:32.740
then you become a senior and next thing you know he's coming in,

1063
01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:35.350
he's breaking up keg parties and you're like,
dude,

1064
01:06:35.351 --> 01:06:39.850
I was in shop class with you six months ago.
Now I'm a police officer now.

1065
01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:44.860
Wow.
Well full on.
You've got the gun and everything.

1066
01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:49.690
I think I just missed a fucking unbelievable game doing this God damn podcast.

1067
01:06:49.691 --> 01:06:54.070
It was two scores late in the game.
You know what I hate about football?

1068
01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:59.440
I hate how they always show the Douche bags who dress up like they're going to

1069
01:06:59.441 --> 01:07:04.390
the rocky horror picture show.
You know what I mean?
I went to a Raiders game.

1070
01:07:04.391 --> 01:07:09.391
Not everybody is dressed like a douchebag and make no mistake.

1071
01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.660
Those are douchebags.
Okay.

1072
01:07:13.661 --> 01:07:16.780
Those people who fucking make a hat out of a football,

1073
01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:20.800
you know they did it the Patriots game too.
I was joking with my buddy,
I go,

1074
01:07:20.801 --> 01:07:23.770
can't they just show some regular fan who looks like he has season tickets?

1075
01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:27.880
It could actually talk about the game.
This guy had like a,
you know,

1076
01:07:28.330 --> 01:07:30.820
silver glitter on his face with the Patriots.

1077
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:35.080
Amble people wearing football helmets to the game.
You know,

1078
01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:38.620
it's almost like the guy in the TV truck is just telling the cameraman,

1079
01:07:38.650 --> 01:07:42.430
just find the biggest douche bag you can find.
That's who we're going to show.

1080
01:07:43.690 --> 01:07:46.420
I went to,
I went to a Raiders game uncle a couple of years ago.
Man It was,

1081
01:07:46.421 --> 01:07:49.690
it was great.
You know,
just a legendary place.

1082
01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:51.880
Even though it's been a while since they've had a lot of success.

1083
01:07:51.881 --> 01:07:55.090
They did go to a Superbowl,
gets Tampa Bay a few years ago,

1084
01:07:55.091 --> 01:07:57.490
but I actually met this older guy,
man.

1085
01:07:57.491 --> 01:08:02.170
He had like the Ken Stabler silver and white beard at some booze on his breath.

1086
01:08:02.171 --> 01:08:03.490
You know,
he's a football fan.

1087
01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:08.080
If I wasn't sitting there dressed like Boba Fett is fucking dumb.

1088
01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:11.260
I hate people do that shit.
All right,
let's plow ahead here.
Um,

1089
01:08:13.050 --> 01:08:14.440
all right.
Uh,
Bill,

1090
01:08:14.441 --> 01:08:18.290
I was bored and thought I might give you something to think about.

1091
01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:22.970
I live in Europe and would love to move to the u s but I have no idea how to

1092
01:08:22.971 --> 01:08:26.780
even apply or even if it's a good time to do it.

1093
01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.810
I'm 30 and I've been stalling for years,

1094
01:08:29.811 --> 01:08:33.290
but I don't want to pack a bag and just end up as some homeless guy in the

1095
01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:37.820
corner in America.
I've always loved New York as the idea,

1096
01:08:38.540 --> 01:08:40.310
as the idea of this,
that city.

1097
01:08:41.330 --> 01:08:45.700
What as the idea of a city that never sleeps fits me.
Um,

1098
01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:47.090
as I'm a little older now,

1099
01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:51.440
I've already seen most of my friends friends leave into the domestic lifestyle

1100
01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:53.510
and I just can't fit into that yet.

1101
01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:58.370
I spent a lot of time alone for a few years and it's just like your act,

1102
01:08:58.371 --> 01:09:02.420
you start going a little crazy.
Um,
I feel like an observer in life,

1103
01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:08.320
so I do and say stuff just to see what happens sometimes.

1104
01:09:09.141 --> 01:09:12.830
Would it be,
sorry,
I'm scrolling down here.
It would be a good ground.

1105
01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:17.570
Would that be a good ground for comedy maybe?

1106
01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.850
Or should I have started in my twenties.

1107
01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:24.110
I also play guitar and people have said I might have something musically for

1108
01:09:24.111 --> 01:09:24.920
years,

1109
01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:28.340
but I was always a coward in my youth and couldn't get on stage unless I was

1110
01:09:28.341 --> 01:09:29.810
hammered.
So I never got anywhere.

1111
01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:34.640
Now I'm worried I lost too many screws and as my social network has begun

1112
01:09:34.641 --> 01:09:35.474
failing,

1113
01:09:35.810 --> 01:09:39.950
I just get the bitter alone against the word world feeling.

1114
01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:42.590
It feels like I'm at a crossroads.

1115
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:46.700
Everything I've seen in life seems like a weird dream and I'm surrounded by

1116
01:09:46.701 --> 01:09:51.230
strangers.
What do you think?
I think that's pretty fucking deep.
Um,

1117
01:09:53.210 --> 01:09:54.920
what is,
well,
if you're not married,

1118
01:09:54.921 --> 01:09:57.560
you don't have any kids and you want always wanted to move to New York,

1119
01:09:57.561 --> 01:10:00.590
just fucking do it.
Save up some money and just do it.

1120
01:10:00.710 --> 01:10:05.480
You're never going to regret,
you know?
Or if you live in America and you're like,

1121
01:10:05.481 --> 01:10:06.860
Hey,
I always want to go to Paris,

1122
01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:10.790
what would happen if I just fucking went there and do it?
The very least.

1123
01:10:10.890 --> 01:10:12.890
You just got to get some great stories.
You know,

1124
01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:14.990
you're going to come over wherever you're going to go.

1125
01:10:14.991 --> 01:10:16.760
You're going to have an accent.
You're gonna Hook Up.

1126
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:18.020
It's going to be a good time.

1127
01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:21.950
I would definitely say to go and don't mind fuck yourself into thinking you're

1128
01:10:21.951 --> 01:10:26.030
too old to do shit.
Look failing.

1129
01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.240
The uh,
uh,
how do we put this?

1130
01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:35.450
Failing is like overrated is far as like the pain that people have.

1131
01:10:35.451 --> 01:10:38.810
It's not doing it because I have a lot of fucking regrets in life.

1132
01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:41.600
I got a lot of fun in regrets.
I'm not going to get into them,

1133
01:10:41.930 --> 01:10:46.160
but I got a lot of fucking regrets and I've failed a lot as a comedian,

1134
01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:50.060
but none of them really hurt cause I just kept doing it.
You know?

1135
01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:54.110
Remember that old Michael Jordan commercial where he talks about shooting the

1136
01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:56.780
basketball is all the shots he's missed.
He's like,

1137
01:10:56.781 --> 01:10:59.720
I failed over and over and over and over again and that's why I succeed.

1138
01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:04.760
You've got to take that mentality,
dude.
Failing is fucking hilarious.
Failing is,

1139
01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:09.470
it's the best stories.
It's the funniest fucking stories.
Watch when people,

1140
01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:13.010
when actors go and they do panel on talk shows,

1141
01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:15.990
they never talk about,
you know,
oh I did this.

1142
01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.500
The bad guests go on there and talk.
Oh,
I work with this director.
Oh my God,

1143
01:11:19.501 --> 01:11:20.334
he was so great.

1144
01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:24.630
But the good guests go on there and they talk about bad auditions that they had

1145
01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:27.990
or stupid things that they did in the great movie that they're promoting.

1146
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:32.640
That's what the fuck you do,
you know,
to kill as a guests.
Look at me,

1147
01:11:32.641 --> 01:11:35.520
I'm too little tired.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm making a different point now.

1148
01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:38.940
Now I'm telling you how to kill doing panel even though I've never fucking done

1149
01:11:38.941 --> 01:11:42.990
it.
Um,
yeah,
dude,
move to New York.

1150
01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.520
You're not gonna be homeless.

1151
01:11:44.610 --> 01:11:48.450
It's like a big river and you just jump in and you just start swimming.

1152
01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:51.930
But from the outside it looks impossible.
But once you go there,
you fine.

1153
01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:57.420
You know,
and if you do end up homeless,
fortunately it's a walkable city,

1154
01:11:57.421 --> 01:12:00.720
so there's plenty of people to panhandle.
Although if you're white,

1155
01:12:00.721 --> 01:12:02.450
you might have a rough time.
At least.
I did.

1156
01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:05.280
Did it one day as a joke just to see what people would do.

1157
01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:09.450
I was dressed really nicely and I just had a cup.
Excuse me sir.
Sir,

1158
01:12:09.451 --> 01:12:11.430
could you spare a little change?
Just trying to get home,

1159
01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:13.260
try and make a phone call.

1160
01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:17.910
But I had a shit eating grin so I didn't make any money.
All right,
next question.

1161
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:21.070
I'm plowing ahead this week,
people.
Uh,

1162
01:12:23.370 --> 01:12:26.490
all right.
Hey Bill,
I'm a huge fan.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
All right.

1163
01:12:26.820 --> 01:12:30.330
You won't be after this low energy podcast.
Um,
throughout my life,

1164
01:12:30.331 --> 01:12:34.050
no matter what I've done,
I've,
I am known for being a horrible child.

1165
01:12:34.670 --> 01:12:36.660
All right guys,
let's stop here.
Uh,
just,

1166
01:12:36.661 --> 01:12:41.550
let's just remember that I barely got out of college and I have a communications

1167
01:12:41.551 --> 01:12:42.384
degree.

1168
01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:46.220
So let me communicate with you right now and let you know if you guys are going

1169
01:12:46.221 --> 01:12:48.690
to go real deep.
Cause I had somebody sent me like one,

1170
01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:53.580
they were like suicidal and uh,
I kinda didn't touch it because a,

1171
01:12:53.581 --> 01:12:55.050
I didn't want to give the wrong advice.

1172
01:12:55.110 --> 01:13:00.060
I was going to say go talk to somebody quite qualified,
you know,

1173
01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:05.130
and don't kill yourself.
All right,
so let's try it.
Let's,

1174
01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:08.280
you know,
let's,
let's back off the throttle a little bit here.
People,

1175
01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.400
this is supposed to be a funny podcast.
All right.
The Light Guy,

1176
01:13:12.030 --> 01:13:15.620
just walking around feeling like it's a dream and I'm alone.
You know,
I,

1177
01:13:15.621 --> 01:13:19.960
that's when it starts getting like,
all right,
I've had those thoughts.
Well,

1178
01:13:19.961 --> 01:13:22.560
I guess I've had those thoughts so I can relate.
You know,

1179
01:13:22.561 --> 01:13:25.440
I've thought about killing myself.
A lot of people think that shit,

1180
01:13:25.441 --> 01:13:27.780
you just don't do it.
You know what I mean?

1181
01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:33.510
It's like leg sweep and a chick.
You think about it,
you just don't do it.

1182
01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:37.890
But if someone makes a video of it,
you fucking watch it.
And it's hilarious.
Um,

1183
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:40.500
all right,
let's plow through here.
Throughout my life,
no matter what I've done,

1184
01:13:40.530 --> 01:13:44.010
I've always been known for being a horrible child.
All right?

1185
01:13:44.011 --> 01:13:47.660
This guy has gotten right to the root of his pain no matter what I did.

1186
01:13:47.730 --> 01:13:49.110
It wasn't good enough.
Um,

1187
01:13:49.111 --> 01:13:52.210
I think I'm a pretty and I feel bad cause I'm be making fun of people as they're

1188
01:13:52.211 --> 01:13:55.650
fucking really opening up here.
So let me stop doing that.
All right.
Uh,

1189
01:13:55.651 --> 01:13:58.650
I think I'm a pretty good kid compared to,
uh,
the people.

1190
01:13:58.651 --> 01:14:01.440
I know my grades aren't that good,
but hey,

1191
01:14:01.441 --> 01:14:04.800
I haven't gotten held back as a positive way of looking at it.

1192
01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:09.630
You got a D in math?
Yeah.
Did I stay back?
Well,
I write then shut the fuck up.

1193
01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:14.140
I'm 15 and I have an older brother,
two years older and I have a younger brother,

1194
01:14:14.141 --> 01:14:17.200
two years younger.
Uh,
the younger one is annoying.

1195
01:14:17.201 --> 01:14:22.120
So if he starts bothering me,
I say something to him telling him to stop.

1196
01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:28.390
Uh Oh,
when I do that,
I'm being a dick.
What?

1197
01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:29.081
I'm being a dick.

1198
01:14:29.081 --> 01:14:33.040
When I could just slap him with something and then he does the classic shit and

1199
01:14:33.041 --> 01:14:37.750
screams like clockwork and my parents will come in and punish,
make,
oh yeah,
dude,

1200
01:14:37.751 --> 01:14:41.170
I've been there.
I had three younger brothers.
I've been there.
Um,

1201
01:14:41.171 --> 01:14:43.230
if he was bothering me first or if he,
he,

1202
01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:46.210
they punish you if he was even bothering you first.
Um,

1203
01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:50.470
or what you gotta do is you've got to muffle his voice with a pillow or he can

1204
01:14:50.471 --> 01:14:55.090
go the opposite route is you can torch room by tickling them is basically you

1205
01:14:55.091 --> 01:14:58.660
sit on their arms and you do the typewriter thing.
You know what I mean?

1206
01:14:59.710 --> 01:15:00.820
Does a lot of other ways to make,

1207
01:15:00.850 --> 01:15:04.390
obviously the slap isn't going to work cause he knows he's going to get you in

1208
01:15:04.391 --> 01:15:05.021
trouble that way.

1209
01:15:05.021 --> 01:15:08.500
So you've got to come up with creative ways to torture your younger brother.

1210
01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:12.430
Start with doing it when your parents aren't home.
All right.

1211
01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:17.440
Why am I telling people to do this shit?
All right.
Uh,

1212
01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:20.860
let me go and at some point they need to stop babying him instead of taking his

1213
01:15:20.861 --> 01:15:22.420
side because he's the youngest.

1214
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:25.960
And then there's my somewhat perfect older brother who was always in the

1215
01:15:25.961 --> 01:15:28.150
limelight.
I admit,
I'm jealous.
I mean,

1216
01:15:28.151 --> 01:15:33.151
he makes honor roll plays football and works all at the same time and I'm just

1217
01:15:33.641 --> 01:15:34.870
the fuck up in the middle.

1218
01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:40.270
Why is it middle kid always feel fucking neglected I guess cause you're in the

1219
01:15:40.271 --> 01:15:43.030
middle.
I was,
you know,
second oldest.

1220
01:15:44.230 --> 01:15:48.670
I don't know where the fuck I was.
Um,
he has always been treated better than me.

1221
01:15:48.730 --> 01:15:51.530
I'm his best friend got him in trouble for,

1222
01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:55.930
for lighting trash cans on fire back when he was in the seventh grade and my dad

1223
01:15:55.931 --> 01:15:59.680
cursed him out and told him to never hang ultra cursed out the other kid and

1224
01:15:59.681 --> 01:16:02.560
told him not to hang out with my older brother again.
Uh,

1225
01:16:02.561 --> 01:16:04.120
what happens in the 12th grade?

1226
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:07.720
I'm there hanging out again and my parents don't say shit.

1227
01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:10.270
I have a bad friend and I haven't even gotten in trouble with them,

1228
01:16:10.271 --> 01:16:11.890
but my parents won't let me hang out with them.

1229
01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:15.370
My parents let my older brother learn how to drive when he was 12 and I'm

1230
01:16:15.371 --> 01:16:17.530
turning 16 and they haven't taught me shit.

1231
01:16:18.490 --> 01:16:21.340
I probably won't get it damn license until I'm 25.

1232
01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:27.670
Then they treat me like shit.
Last week I cleaned my bathroom and left,
uh,

1233
01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:30.400
my mini trash cans sitting outside the bathroom.

1234
01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:32.950
And instead of being glad they go,
wait,

1235
01:16:32.951 --> 01:16:35.020
because I leave the trash can outside the bedroom.

1236
01:16:35.021 --> 01:16:39.880
Please tell me what you think about this situation.
Um,
yeah,

1237
01:16:39.881 --> 01:16:41.440
you're getting the middle child treatment.

1238
01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:45.940
You get in the middle child treatment and this is what I would say,

1239
01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:50.920
beat up your younger brother when your parents aren't around or maybe break some

1240
01:16:50.921 --> 01:16:55.750
of his shit when he's not in his room and a,
your older brother,
uh,

1241
01:16:55.751 --> 01:16:59.710
you can cut the brake lines on his car.
Now I'm fucking with you.
Um,

1242
01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:05.440
uh,
you know what?
Fuck them.
Fuck them.
If they don't want to pay attention to you,

1243
01:17:05.770 --> 01:17:08.980
fuck them.
Just keep doing your thing.
And I make a joke out of,

1244
01:17:11.150 --> 01:17:16.100
you know,
you know you left a trash can outside the bathroom.
I know.

1245
01:17:16.101 --> 01:17:19.940
What was I thinking?
I should have been like my older brother and lit it on fire.

1246
01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:24.260
You're absolutely right.
At what point did you realize you were bored with me?

1247
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.990
Huh?
When the newer version of me came along

1248
01:17:29.060 --> 01:17:31.910
and then when she tries to interrupt you speak now dad,
dad,
I get it.

1249
01:17:31.911 --> 01:17:35.630
You don't care.
You don't.
I'm the Middle Kid.
What do you think?

1250
01:17:35.631 --> 01:17:38.240
I don't watch the Brady bunch.
I saw what Jan went through.

1251
01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:39.680
I'm going through the same shit.

1252
01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:46.750
Then bring up that shit about driving.
Huh?

1253
01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:50.870
How bad a driver was my older brother that you just decided not to teach any of

1254
01:17:50.871 --> 01:17:55.010
us,
you know,
I dunno.

1255
01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:59.230
Just go with that route.
But you know [inaudible] don't take it personally.

1256
01:17:59.250 --> 01:18:01.220
Just focus on your own life.
You've got to understand,

1257
01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:04.340
you're probably walking around 15 you know,
you know,

1258
01:18:04.360 --> 01:18:06.620
you're at that age where you kind of think he knows some shit,

1259
01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:09.290
but you kind of know that you don't know a lot of other shit,

1260
01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:12.790
that that feeling never goes away and your parents are walking around thinking

1261
01:18:12.900 --> 01:18:17.090
the same shit,
so don't take them too seriously,
you know,
unless they tell you,

1262
01:18:17.091 --> 01:18:20.090
you know not to do drugs or hang out with that Douche bag,

1263
01:18:20.091 --> 01:18:22.070
you probably shouldn't be hanging out with them.
But you know what I mean?

1264
01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:24.140
I don't,
I don't want it to tell you dude.

1265
01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:26.930
It's like that shit that you're going to get through.

1266
01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:30.680
It gets better when you're in your twenties you know,
and you never know.

1267
01:18:30.681 --> 01:18:34.460
Your brother might have peaked that AMsuite a lot of people,
you know,

1268
01:18:34.461 --> 01:18:37.580
if they get in fucking late in high school,
like do you want to say,

1269
01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:38.720
and how great your life is.

1270
01:18:38.721 --> 01:18:43.310
If you're actually on the football team and you're fucking a cheerleader in high

1271
01:18:43.311 --> 01:18:46.490
school,
I mean,
I don't know how you ever beat that.

1272
01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:49.220
You have to become like a fucking movie star.

1273
01:18:49.221 --> 01:18:52.340
Like there's nowhere for those people to go.
That's why so many of those people,

1274
01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:55.580
they,
when they go out in the real world,
they,
they,
they,

1275
01:18:55.730 --> 01:18:59.600
they fail because they've always been,

1276
01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:05.270
I mean you king of the world,
you're on a football team,

1277
01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:09.410
you're banging a cheerleader,
right?
You both in your teens,

1278
01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:13.370
your bodies are in mint fucking condition and you don't have to pay rent.

1279
01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:16.430
And if you do some dumb shit,
you're still charged as a juvenile.

1280
01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:19.910
I'm going to tell you right now,
it's never going to get better than that.
Okay.

1281
01:19:19.911 --> 01:19:23.120
Are you going to go a long fucking way as an adult to make it better than that?

1282
01:19:23.150 --> 01:19:26.990
Okay,
so you know,

1283
01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:30.000
I don't know if I'm sharing,
you're up here,
but you know,

1284
01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.750
being in the middle of being in that mix is not a bad fucking thing.

1285
01:19:32.751 --> 01:19:34.790
Being in the middle of the herd.
Cause then you can break out,

1286
01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:38.060
you can try to figure out what you want to do and then the fact that people kind

1287
01:19:38.061 --> 01:19:40.970
of Shit on you,
you get a good sense of humor.
You already wrote some funny shit.

1288
01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:44.240
You'll be fine.
You are,
fuck your older brother and your younger brother.

1289
01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:47.120
What do you think about that?
I know what to tell you,
dude.

1290
01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.530
I just don't want to fuck you up,
dude.
I don't,
I don't,

1291
01:19:48.531 --> 01:19:52.160
I don't have the background to give a 15 year old fucking advice.
I really don't.

1292
01:19:52.161 --> 01:19:55.880
But I hope I made some sort of sense,
but don't take it too seriously.
All right.

1293
01:19:56.780 --> 01:19:57.613
You know what I would do?

1294
01:19:57.650 --> 01:20:00.800
I would always clean the bathroom and always leave the trash can out there just

1295
01:20:00.801 --> 01:20:05.801
to deliberately annoy your parents and then act slightly retarded to the point

1296
01:20:06.770 --> 01:20:09.960
that actually think back to some drugs that they did when they were single.

1297
01:20:09.961 --> 01:20:12.540
And that's why you're fucked up now,
you know,
do some shit like that.

1298
01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:13.950
Just passive aggressive stuff.

1299
01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:16.800
Started having fun with the fact that they don't pay attention to you.

1300
01:20:17.130 --> 01:20:21.720
In other words,
act out.
That's what I'm trying to say.
All right,
so let's recap.

1301
01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:26.940
Break a younger brother's shit.
Cut The brake lines and your older brother's car.

1302
01:20:27.330 --> 01:20:31.940
Ignore your parents and act slightly retarded.
All right,

1303
01:20:32.820 --> 01:20:37.590
that's my advice.
Um,
oh,
here's something for you.
I got good.
I wrote a,

1304
01:20:37.591 --> 01:20:42.300
I got good feedback from a woman.
I don't get this very often and said,
hey bill,

1305
01:20:42.301 --> 01:20:45.510
just wanted to comment on your response to the guy who got shot down at the

1306
01:20:45.511 --> 01:20:47.220
sandwich shop a couple of weeks ago.

1307
01:20:47.490 --> 01:20:51.330
That was a loaded question and for what it's worth from a female fan,

1308
01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:54.810
I thought your answer was incredibly fair as well as funny.

1309
01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:59.430
It is bullshit that men generally have the burden of approaching women and I

1310
01:20:59.431 --> 01:21:04.050
know that burned is asked to have her look at him like a disgusting chore,

1311
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:05.880
but just because She's pretty,

1312
01:21:05.881 --> 01:21:10.290
doesn't mean she owes everybody whoever tits on her a fucking thank you card.

1313
01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:11.850
I really appreciate your answer.

1314
01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:16.410
You could have gone a much easier and shittier root.
Thanks.
Yeah,

1315
01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:20.550
you mean like how he did with the 15 year old kids question.
All right.

1316
01:21:20.610 --> 01:21:23.460
Every once in a,
I get positive feedback feedback from a female,

1317
01:21:23.461 --> 01:21:24.960
so I got to read it.
All right,
next one.

1318
01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:27.270
I'm just going to read this like a book this week.
People,

1319
01:21:27.410 --> 01:21:31.080
I'm literally nodding off here,
uh,
asked bill,
hey bill.
Uh,

1320
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:35.220
throughout my life to matter.
What I've done,
and I already read this

1321
01:21:36.810 --> 01:21:41.100
already,
read this one,
right?
Jesus Christ.
All right.
Oh,

1322
01:21:41.101 --> 01:21:44.580
here's some letters from people overseas,
specifically England.

1323
01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:47.550
This section's called English cunts.
Hey,
built.

1324
01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:50.850
So he thought my last email wasn't good enough for your podcast.

1325
01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.350
I hold no grudges.

1326
01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:55.740
It's a recession and you want to keep it all American fair play.

1327
01:21:56.010 --> 01:21:59.430
So let's keep up the theme from your last one in attempt to get a mention,

1328
01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:03.930
a shameless whoring of myself here.
I,
you say baseball jumped the shark.

1329
01:22:04.230 --> 01:22:07.560
Let me tell you something.
Coming from the nation that pretty much invent,

1330
01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:12.240
invented all major sports except the Olympics.
Great Britain.

1331
01:22:13.950 --> 01:22:18.300
You know,
I like to consider myself knowledgeable about sports.
Uh,

1332
01:22:18.301 --> 01:22:20.700
exactly what sports did you create?

1333
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:23.850
What sports did you create?

1334
01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:27.870
You can do the rugby thing and then rugby developed into football.

1335
01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:31.170
I'll give you that one.
That,
that was the spawn of it.

1336
01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:35.670
But you can't take credit for baseball.
What do you say?
That's cricket.

1337
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:39.420
You guys sit there with that fraternity paddle from some horrific night of

1338
01:22:39.421 --> 01:22:39.841
hazing.

1339
01:22:39.841 --> 01:22:42.930
You finally pulled it out of some freshman's ass and now you're trying to hit a

1340
01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:47.550
racket ball over to some guy from fucking India.
Huh?

1341
01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:52.140
What other sports have you guys invented?
Basketball.
You didn't invent that.

1342
01:22:53.400 --> 01:22:56.280
I don't know what you guys invented,
but you're sure suck it all of them.

1343
01:22:57.330 --> 01:23:01.590
You know when was the last time you guys won a World Cup?
You know what?

1344
01:23:01.591 --> 01:23:06.070
That's a great fucking question.
That's what you guys are known for soccer,
right?

1345
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:10.450
And rugby.
Like when those douchebags over in England tried to,

1346
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:14.800
they always try to say that that foot football players are pussies because they

1347
01:23:14.801 --> 01:23:19.210
were like helmets and that type of shit.
And then you watch a rugby game.

1348
01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:22.810
Those guys are tough.
But those guys would be hitting each other a lot.

1349
01:23:22.811 --> 01:23:25.930
Fucking harder if they had pads on and shit.
You know,

1350
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:28.320
I watched the game.
He,

1351
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:31.630
it's a bunch of guys fucking stick in their heads up each other's asses as

1352
01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:34.000
they're kicking out a football.
That's definitely,
and I know,

1353
01:23:34.001 --> 01:23:37.550
you know what's funny is I never disrespect rugby.
I look at it like that.

1354
01:23:37.551 --> 01:23:39.610
That's a tough sport.
And tough guys play that sport.

1355
01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:42.490
I don't know why they always pick on football.
I don't get it.

1356
01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:45.570
You know what I mean?
Dude,

1357
01:23:45.571 --> 01:23:50.520
Ray Lewis would fuck up at least five of your rugby players by himself without

1358
01:23:50.521 --> 01:23:51.354
pads.

1359
01:23:51.880 --> 01:23:56.310
You got nobody in your fucking little pussy ass English rugby league that looks

1360
01:23:56.311 --> 01:23:59.070
anything like Ray Lewis let ray Lewis would destroy him.

1361
01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:02.850
Jack Lambert,
once you bring them,

1362
01:24:02.851 --> 01:24:07.080
bring me your famous fucking rugby guys and show me how those guys are hitting

1363
01:24:07.081 --> 01:24:11.490
any harder than Lawrence Taylor.
You're out of your fucking mind.

1364
01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.790
Out of your fucking minds.
Let's look up England,

1365
01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:18.050
England.

1366
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:23.110
World Cup victory.

1367
01:24:23.210 --> 01:24:25.640
I'm going to make a guess and I'm going to say it's,
it's somewhere.

1368
01:24:25.641 --> 01:24:28.010
It's gotta be the 1960s or before

1369
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:32.710
England World Cup victory.

1370
01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:38.560
The World Cup victory by England.
1966.
There you go.
I fucking knew it.

1371
01:24:39.190 --> 01:24:40.270
I knew it was going to be back then.

1372
01:24:40.271 --> 01:24:43.630
Like when the Celtics were winning all their championships.
Right?

1373
01:24:43.810 --> 01:24:48.730
Was Brazil not allowed in back then?
Fucking pat in your stats.

1374
01:24:50.110 --> 01:24:53.240
Um,
I'm just fucking with you guys.
I respect your sports,
but I ate out.
Oh what?

1375
01:24:53.241 --> 01:24:57.410
What are you pretty much eventually all major sports except the Olympics.

1376
01:24:57.411 --> 01:25:00.320
Go Fuck Yourself.
You guys didn't invent shit.

1377
01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:05.120
You had a half ass idea that we made.
Tremendous.
Is there any,

1378
01:25:05.121 --> 01:25:08.050
you know what I mean?
Like the greatest fucking soccer player of all time.
He's,

1379
01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:09.020
is he from England?

1380
01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:14.610
Palae the Michael Jordan of soccer is not even from England's.

1381
01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:19.540
Why don't you guys dominate something on a world fucking level?
I want what,
what,

1382
01:25:19.541 --> 01:25:21.940
what was the last time you guys had an athlete?

1383
01:25:23.320 --> 01:25:26.300
Cause I'll tell you right now that good looking son of a bitch for the La Galaxy

1384
01:25:26.301 --> 01:25:29.240
is not doing shit and nobody gives a fuck about him over here.

1385
01:25:29.241 --> 01:25:32.600
You can walk up and buy a ticket.
All right.
I,

1386
01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:35.790
Oh to La Galaxy fucking game.
I parked right next to the guy.

1387
01:25:36.450 --> 01:25:37.410
I didn't even recognize him.

1388
01:25:38.490 --> 01:25:38.760
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1389
01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.650
<v 7>I asked him which way the fucking stadium was.</v>

1390
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:43.910
The only reason why I knew he was on the fucking galaxies cause he already had

1391
01:25:43.911 --> 01:25:47.750
his fucking cleats on.
All right.
He can't wait to go back there.

1392
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:53.770
Um,
all right to fuck Bob Beckham.
All right.
Let me,

1393
01:25:53.771 --> 01:25:57.430
let me get back to this fucking thing.
I think I come from some authority.

1394
01:25:57.490 --> 01:25:59.620
Oh yeah.
Once you pat yourself on the back a little more.

1395
01:25:59.770 --> 01:26:03.950
Your English [inaudible] here we go.
Baseball always fucking sucked.
No it didn't.

1396
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:09.290
And I'll tell you why it's a game suited for America like no other hours of time

1397
01:26:09.291 --> 01:26:12.800
to kill between meaningful play.

1398
01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:16.820
Meaningful for some reason is two words.
Meaning full,

1399
01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:20.180
like what is the meaning of the word and IAA.
Too much.
Um,

1400
01:26:20.181 --> 01:26:23.450
full meaningful is one word.
Get Dumb cunt.

1401
01:26:23.690 --> 01:26:27.920
Take the last l off the full and smash them together.
Jesus,

1402
01:26:27.921 --> 01:26:31.640
I hope that's right here.
I just made an ass out of myself.
Uh,
between meaningful,

1403
01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:36.380
um,
play,
allowing for re the required TV,

1404
01:26:36.381 --> 01:26:41.380
advertising and selling of Shit.
Overpriced food and poor beer out.

1405
01:26:41.381 --> 01:26:43.790
Jesus Christ.
Really?
You don't have any advertising there.

1406
01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:48.710
There's advertising all over the fizz advertising on the fucking ball in
England.

1407
01:26:50.210 --> 01:26:54.110
You know what?
Maybe if you guys scored more than once every fucking 90 minutes,

1408
01:26:56.510 --> 01:27:00.470
you know what I mean?
You could stick some commercials in there.
Jesus Christ,

1409
01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:05.740
that soccer is like hockey without the skates and the scoring and the fighting

1410
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:07.970
and everything.
That makes it great.

1411
01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:12.070
You have to see like a little sissy get tripped out and I don't know,

1412
01:27:12.090 --> 01:27:15.320
during recess and he rolls around in the ground.

1413
01:27:15.630 --> 01:27:17.330
It makes such a big fucking deal out of it.

1414
01:27:17.331 --> 01:27:19.070
You want to beat him with his own books.

1415
01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:23.060
That's what like watching soccer is like every five seconds.
These guys,

1416
01:27:23.210 --> 01:27:25.250
they look like if,
if Pau Gasol,

1417
01:27:26.450 --> 01:27:31.040
if you could have like whatever 20 power saws all in the same fucking field,

1418
01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:36.170
just bitch and Moan and with that crybaby fucking face,
that's what soccer is.

1419
01:27:36.530 --> 01:27:38.420
See what you did,
dude.
I actually really enjoy the game,

1420
01:27:38.421 --> 01:27:41.450
but you're attacking my shits and I gotta attack yours.
Um,

1421
01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:44.630
minimal athleticism required.
Yeah,
dude,

1422
01:27:44.631 --> 01:27:47.360
really hitting a baseball is one of the hardest thing you'll ever do.

1423
01:27:48.140 --> 01:27:50.300
Why don't you fucking brush your teeth and give it a chance?

1424
01:27:50.301 --> 01:27:53.300
At some point you guys are swinging with that big fucking paddle

1425
01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:56.540
can.
All right,
let me go.
You know,

1426
01:27:56.620 --> 01:27:59.600
I would never make fun of the bicycle kick and act like that's a simple thing to

1427
01:27:59.601 --> 01:28:02.300
do anyways.
And before you come up with this stock,

1428
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:05.750
we'd like to see you face a hundred mile an hour curve.
I just did that.

1429
01:28:05.751 --> 01:28:06.590
That's hilarious.

1430
01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:11.570
From insert drugged up goon here and then talk that shit.

1431
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:15.710
It's a game.
Not a sport.
Like bowling is a game

1432
01:28:18.530 --> 01:28:22.640
now.
It isn't.
I can see a bowling's a game.
It's just you standing there.

1433
01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:27.710
If somebody was throwing the bowling ball at your head at a hundred miles an

1434
01:28:27.710 --> 01:28:30.380
hour and it was fucking changing speeds,

1435
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:34.820
then that would be a sport.
Okay.

1436
01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:38.960
Or if he just held the ball like tee ball,
you just hit it off the stand.

1437
01:28:41.030 --> 01:28:44.230
Then it would just be,
that would just be a game.
I Dunno.

1438
01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:48.270
Athlete athletes or people who actually move around for the majority of the

1439
01:28:48.271 --> 01:28:51.500
sport cyclists,
rowers,

1440
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:56.030
even soccer players cover around 10 k per game.
Oh God.

1441
01:28:57.170 --> 01:28:59.120
Really?
Is that why they were all built like women,

1442
01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:02.010
you know what your athletes look like and fucking England.

1443
01:29:02.011 --> 01:29:06.930
They look like mannequins at the gap.
You know.
I know we're fat over here,

1444
01:29:06.931 --> 01:29:08.400
but we're more muscular to you.

1445
01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:11.700
Fucking pansies over there with your poor nutrition in your nationwide

1446
01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:14.910
healthcare plan.
Why don't you get some fucking protein in your diets?

1447
01:29:15.570 --> 01:29:19.320
The skinny ass fucking arms and your little legs running around,

1448
01:29:19.321 --> 01:29:22.380
not being able to,
you know why you can't use your fucking hands in soccer?

1449
01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:26.250
Cause you fags would break your wrists.
All right,
that was homophobic.

1450
01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:29.400
Sorry about that.
They mean to say fag.
Sorry.
Just get worked up.
Anyways,

1451
01:29:29.401 --> 01:29:30.720
let's come.
Let's finish this.

1452
01:29:31.020 --> 01:29:33.870
The game comes from an old English game of rounders,

1453
01:29:34.260 --> 01:29:36.480
which was buying larger game of women.

1454
01:29:38.250 --> 01:29:41.640
The fuck is he talking about now?
You know,
I don't even give a shit anymore.

1455
01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:48.390
Whilst me,
we,
me were,
while the real me,

1456
01:29:48.570 --> 01:29:53.520
we're playing rugby and football.
What?
Oh,

1457
01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:56.220
Jesus Christ.
You're trying to say baseball was made up by a woman.

1458
01:29:56.410 --> 01:29:57.870
Is that what you're trying to say?
You know what?
I love?

1459
01:29:57.871 --> 01:30:00.720
Everybody acts like they fucking hate America and they can't stop paying

1460
01:30:00.721 --> 01:30:04.770
attention to us.
I don't listen to any English douchebags podcast.
You know?

1461
01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:09.120
I don't know a fucking thing.
I know Tony Blair,

1462
01:30:10.170 --> 01:30:13.950
Tony Blair bitched up and fucking sent you guys,
you know,

1463
01:30:14.050 --> 01:30:17.070
got you guys into fucking Iraq too.
Cause he didn't have any balls.
You know why?

1464
01:30:17.250 --> 01:30:21.810
Because he plays soccer.
Wow.
That was really fucking mean.
Alright.
Underrated.

1465
01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:24.360
Check out this Scottish comedian Frankie Boyle.

1466
01:30:24.361 --> 01:30:28.020
Very dark but funny Scottish guys are fucking hilarious.

1467
01:30:29.370 --> 01:30:29.610
Um,

1468
01:30:29.610 --> 01:30:34.610
I look forward to your non [inaudible] non reply and if I do get past your

1469
01:30:34.951 --> 01:30:39.330
filtering process,
fucking up reading this out loud.
Well I did all of that.

1470
01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:42.360
I don't have any filtering process.
I read all of these goddamn things.

1471
01:30:42.361 --> 01:30:47.040
I have nothing better to do.
Where are we in this podcast?
44 fucking minutes.

1472
01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:50.400
All right,
let's get to some overrated,
underrated.
Um,

1473
01:30:53.870 --> 01:30:56.760
what the fuck are we going?
All right.
Overrated.
Uh,

1474
01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:03.810
okay.
Overrated drummer Neil Peart.
Now before all the prog rock tech heads,

1475
01:31:03.811 --> 01:31:06.750
start quoting modern drummer here me out.

1476
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:11.700
We've had the technology since the 1960s to program a computer to play poly

1477
01:31:11.701 --> 01:31:12.600
rhythmic beats.

1478
01:31:12.840 --> 01:31:17.040
Try having garage band play Elvin Jones or Rashied Ali.

1479
01:31:17.070 --> 01:31:20.570
I don't know who that is.
Um,
dude,
you can't say that man.

1480
01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:23.700
Those are different kinds of drums.
Although I'm not really into Neil Peart.

1481
01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:28.860
I'm not until,
I think he's,
I don't know.
He's just too fucking on the beat.

1482
01:31:29.100 --> 01:31:33.630
He sounds like a robot.
He's fucking amazing.
But uh,
I like,
I dunno,

1483
01:31:33.780 --> 01:31:36.450
I think people either like John Bonam.
Oh,
you like Neil Peart.

1484
01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.340
You know what I mean?
Nobody gives a fuck.
They're not drummers.
All right.

1485
01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:47.040
Um,
I think that's it.
I think that's going to be it for the podcast.
Um,

1486
01:31:48.270 --> 01:31:49.980
as I'm fucking trying to get a Gig in England.

1487
01:31:49.981 --> 01:31:54.000
I just fucking trashed everybody over there.
I'm just,
you know,

1488
01:31:54.001 --> 01:31:57.450
everybody just fucking trash in American non fucking stop now.

1489
01:31:57.510 --> 01:32:01.780
And then you go to their countries and eno,
you see Fat Fox,
you see losers.

1490
01:32:02.050 --> 01:32:05.320
I don't know what they're bragging about.
I really don't.

1491
01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:10.600
They talk about how amazing their beer is.
I gotta admit I went to Sweden,

1492
01:32:10.601 --> 01:32:13.990
they did some good beers,
man.
A couple of beers from,
uh,

1493
01:32:15.070 --> 01:32:16.720
actually had one from Czechoslovakia,

1494
01:32:16.721 --> 01:32:19.570
some checks assumption that still doesn't even exist anymore.
The Czech Republic,

1495
01:32:19.571 --> 01:32:21.760
whatever the fuck it is.
I don't know.

1496
01:32:21.761 --> 01:32:23.380
That's another thing that bugs me about Europeans.

1497
01:32:23.470 --> 01:32:26.410
They think they're so fucking worldly cause they know all about Europe and shit

1498
01:32:26.411 --> 01:32:31.240
and it's like Europe is like basically the size of half of America.

1499
01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:34.510
So if you know something about the state next to you that's the same as like

1500
01:32:34.511 --> 01:32:36.790
somebody from England,
no one about France.

1501
01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:40.660
I mean you can fucking drive there at this point.
It's really not impressive,

1502
01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:42.340
but it is beautiful over there.

1503
01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:47.170
Whatever Hitler didn't bomp bomb and is still left standing is very nice.

1504
01:32:48.190 --> 01:32:51.430
Um,
all right.
I was a little cunty this week just cause I was tired.
Uh,

1505
01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:54.460
blame it on that.
Um,
and I think that's it.

1506
01:32:54.461 --> 01:32:56.920
I think that's all that I have to say this week.
Uh,

1507
01:32:56.921 --> 01:32:59.140
I just want to thank everybody for the tremendous turnout,

1508
01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:02.710
the tremendous turnout in Philadelphia.

1509
01:33:02.770 --> 01:33:06.550
I actually had to stay an extra day and at a show that was awesome.
Um,

1510
01:33:06.551 --> 01:33:07.031
let me hype,

1511
01:33:07.031 --> 01:33:11.230
my show's coming up and I don't you English costs get all pissed off of what the

1512
01:33:11.231 --> 01:33:15.940
fuck I say because I don't even read half the shit that you guys,
right.
You know,

1513
01:33:16.450 --> 01:33:19.060
calling me up,
telling me if I talk about American sports,

1514
01:33:19.061 --> 01:33:22.900
it's boring as if I give a flying fuck,
you know.

1515
01:33:24.730 --> 01:33:26.740
All right.
Let me get to my website and obviously I can give a fuck.

1516
01:33:26.741 --> 01:33:29.310
I'm bringing it up.
Um,
and I also,
if you,

1517
01:33:29.330 --> 01:33:31.240
if you're just trying to write shit to Piss me off,

1518
01:33:31.241 --> 01:33:34.090
it's going to work because I have to respond to everything because I have that

1519
01:33:34.091 --> 01:33:38.590
disease where I have to make my point.
Um,
all right,
let's get to the,
uh,

1520
01:33:38.591 --> 01:33:42.220
what I got coming up.
Um,
not this weekend.

1521
01:33:42.221 --> 01:33:46.930
Next weekend I'm going to be the Improv in Addison,
Texas.
Uh,

1522
01:33:46.931 --> 01:33:50.320
September 24th,
25th,
26th.

1523
01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:54.940
And I'm also the Sunday.
Is that the 27th?

1524
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:58.240
I think I added the day cause I'm hanging around going to the cowboys game.

1525
01:33:59.140 --> 01:34:01.120
Let me see here.
Uh,

1526
01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:05.890
checking out the calendar.
Yeah.
And the 27th,

1527
01:34:05.891 --> 01:34:08.680
I'll be there Thursday through Sunday,
we added a Sunday show.

1528
01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:09.573
I'm going to be there.

1529
01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:13.300
God damage to bring your friends down and I'll see you at the cowboys' game on

1530
01:34:13.301 --> 01:34:17.950
Monday.
Then on,
um,
October 2nd,
third and fourth,

1531
01:34:17.951 --> 01:34:22.540
I'm going to be at the stress factory in New Brunswick,
New Jersey.
And,
uh,

1532
01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:25.990
the following weekend I'll be at the Improv in Pittsburgh and all the rest of my

1533
01:34:25.991 --> 01:34:29.410
dates are up my website.
I want to thank everybody for a,
all the great support.

1534
01:34:29.411 --> 01:34:33.520
I've really had a tremendous last couple of gigs here,
you know,

1535
01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:37.390
going into Atlanta,
over to Stockholm,
Sweden,
and then down to Philadelphia.

1536
01:34:37.391 --> 01:34:41.040
Really tremendous turnout.
I really appreciate it.
And,
uh,

1537
01:34:41.050 --> 01:34:43.750
all you guys basically out there asking me when I'm going to come to your

1538
01:34:43.751 --> 01:34:48.040
country,
you know,
Australia,
New Zealand,
I'm working on that shit.

1539
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:52.770
I'm going to,
uh,
try to put some,
uh,
youtube videos up on a,

1540
01:34:52.771 --> 01:34:56.740
I discovered when I was in Stockholm,
Sweden,
that youtube,
you know,

1541
01:34:56.741 --> 01:34:59.630
there's like literally just like Wikipedia,
you know what I mean?

1542
01:34:59.630 --> 01:35:01.050
There's all kinds of different youtube,

1543
01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:04.910
I just stuck with the English one because I'm a fucking American surrounded by

1544
01:35:04.911 --> 01:35:08.260
people speaking English and water.
But,
uh,

1545
01:35:08.290 --> 01:35:10.870
I'm going to try and get some shit up on maybe the Australian one.

1546
01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:13.090
The England will English one or whatever.

1547
01:35:13.130 --> 01:35:15.790
I guess evidently that's a way to build a following over there.

1548
01:35:15.791 --> 01:35:19.090
So hopefully I can travel over there and maybe I'll check out some of your

1549
01:35:19.091 --> 01:35:22.210
sporting events and maybe I'll change my opinions,
but you know,
something,

1550
01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:27.360
I would be way more open to enjoying sports from England or someplace else.

1551
01:35:27.460 --> 01:35:31.110
If you could just tell me about them without fucking trash in,

1552
01:35:32.110 --> 01:35:35.490
you know,
American sports first.
If you just want to hear me flip out,

1553
01:35:35.491 --> 01:35:39.920
then by all means continue what you're doing because it's working.
All right?
But,

1554
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:43.010
uh,
you know,
hey,
no disrespect to your troops that went over to Iraq too.

1555
01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:46.060
You know,
I just wanna make sure I didn't get a little out of hand there.

1556
01:35:46.150 --> 01:35:50.290
All right.
This is all jokes,
so don't send me any fucking hate mail.
All right.

1557
01:35:50.291 --> 01:35:52.060
That's the Monday morning podcast for this week.

1558
01:35:52.061 --> 01:35:55.060
Thank you everybody for listening.
And,
uh,

1559
01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:58.420
I know there was one other fucking per thing I didn't get to.

1560
01:35:58.430 --> 01:36:01.990
Maybe I'll get to it next week.
Wow,
that's it.
That's it for the podcast.

1561
01:36:01.991 --> 01:36:02.860
Everybody have a great week.
