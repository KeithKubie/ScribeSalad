00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.175
Hey it's me Destin

00:00:01.175 --> 00:00:02.438
welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.438 --> 00:00:03.763
Depending on where you get your media

00:00:03.763 --> 00:00:06.203
you're probably aware that we just failed for the third time

00:00:06.203 --> 00:00:09.368
in eight months to get cargo vehicles up to the International Space Station,

00:00:09.368 --> 00:00:11.439
which means that cargo didn't make it up there.

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.453
Now the media's really negative about this and I understand that.

00:00:14.453 --> 00:00:15.976
It's never good to blow up rockets.

00:00:15.976 --> 00:00:18.657
However, as a rocket tester, that's my day job,

00:00:18.657 --> 00:00:21.117
I think I'm a little bit more positive about this.

00:00:21.117 --> 00:00:25.684
And the reason is because I've always learned more from rocket failures than from successes.

00:00:25.684 --> 00:00:28.085
Before I show the explosions let's talk about one thing.

00:00:28.085 --> 00:00:29.321
It's called staging.

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:33.770
So imagine you've got this rocket and you've got really big propellant tanks and you've got engines on it right?

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.657
At some point along the way you're gonna have really big empty tanks and that's just a lot of extra weight.

00:00:38.657 --> 00:00:43.196
Rocket engineers figured out a long time ago that if they drop off all that extra weight

00:00:43.196 --> 00:00:46.208
and they switch over to another rocket engine and smaller tanks

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:48.229
that they can get to orbit more efficiently.

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:51.890
This is a beautiful thing and it works because of something called the rocket equation.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.450
OK time to look at the failures.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.087
The first failure was an Orbital Sciences Antares vehicle carrying the Cygnus spacecraft.

00:00:58.087 --> 00:01:03.254
Now this vehicle was interesting because it used Russian engines that were literally 40 years old.

00:01:03.254 --> 00:01:07.027
Now that sounds crazy at first but rocket engines are super expensive

00:01:07.027 --> 00:01:09.265
and these were actually really efficient engines.

00:01:09.265 --> 00:01:13.302
Anyway, they were refurbished but still there was a catastrophic failure.

00:01:13.302 --> 00:01:17.173
Unfortunately a lot of stuff didn't make it to the space station.

00:01:17.173 --> 00:01:20.485
The second failure was a Russian vehicle called Progress 59.

00:01:20.485 --> 00:01:23.253
It launched like normal from Baikonur and it even made it to space

00:01:23.253 --> 00:01:27.086
but somewhere up there there was a failure on the third stage and everything went cattywampus.

00:01:27.086 --> 00:01:31.980
The engineers couldn't regain control and the vehicle eventually burned up in the earth's atmosphere.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.156
Among other things there were a lot of toilet repair parts on that progress vehicle

00:01:35.156 --> 00:01:36.248
which is a pretty big deal.

00:01:36.248 --> 00:01:37.145
You gotta poop somewhere.

00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:40.670
The most recent failure was of a Falcon 9 rocket made by SpaceX.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.439
Again the launch seemed to be normal,

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:43.796
everything seemed to be going well

00:01:43.796 --> 00:01:46.865
and then it seemed to vent something out the side that looked like liquid oxygen

00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:48.835
and then all of a sudden it exploded.

00:01:48.835 --> 00:01:52.254
I'm not gonna speculate on why it exploded because I'm not a system expert.

00:01:52.254 --> 00:01:54.106
Those exist and I'm not one of them.

00:01:54.106 --> 00:01:57.672
In terms of hardware loss there was a lot of normal supplies and scientific gear

00:01:57.672 --> 00:01:59.680
as well as an international docking adaptor,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.054
a HoloLens and a space suit.

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:03.960
Space suits don't really grow on trees.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.989
OK let's talk about what this means for the space station

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:08.093
because there's a lot of chow that didn't make it up there.

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:10.928
There's a person in the front of the control room called the ISO,

00:02:10.928 --> 00:02:12.584
the inventory and stowage officer,

00:02:12.584 --> 00:02:16.656
and their job is to know exactly what is where on the International Space Station.

00:02:16.656 --> 00:02:18.061
For example, food.

00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:20.040
When it comes time to eat on the space station

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.232
astronauts have large bags of food.

00:02:22.232 --> 00:02:24.667
They'll scan it with a scanner. Boop.

00:02:24.667 --> 00:02:27.245
That tells the ISO that that bag is now open.

00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:32.687
They'll open the bag up and they'll start eating food out of that bag and that bag will last them about a week.

00:02:32.687 --> 00:02:36.225
They try to plan at least 60 days ahead of the next cargo vehicle.

00:02:36.225 --> 00:02:37.477
It's called a skip cycle.

00:02:37.477 --> 00:02:43.256
So when Cygnus blew up they took that 60 day window and they compressed it down to about 45 days.

00:02:43.256 --> 00:02:46.963
This is an internal discussion that these guys have to manage their assets.

00:02:46.963 --> 00:02:51.731
The good news is there's no longer 3 astronauts on the American side of the space station

00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:55.071
eating up all the food. There's only one. Scott Kelly.

00:02:55.071 --> 00:02:58.945
And trust me, Scott Kelly can't eat three astronauts worth of food.

00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:01.475
The fact that we've lost three vehicles pretty much in a row

00:03:01.475 --> 00:03:03.600
and we still have plenty of supplies on the space station

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.441
speaks to how awesome these engineers and mission planners are.

00:03:06.441 --> 00:03:08.024
ISOs are pretty awesome.

00:03:08.024 --> 00:03:09.525
Is it OK to keep blowing up rockets?

00:03:09.525 --> 00:03:15.120
No. But I would submit to you that this might be the perfect time for it to happen if it has to.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.030
The cargo vehicle program has been incredibly reliable,

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.626
almost routine in fact.

00:03:19.626 --> 00:03:20.961
I mean look at these numbers.

00:03:20.961 --> 00:03:25.336
These reliability rates are right on par for the non-human-rated rocket business.

00:03:25.336 --> 00:03:26.878
You know why this is impressive to me.

00:03:26.878 --> 00:03:30.104
There are billions of wifi connections all over the world

00:03:30.104 --> 00:03:32.272
and there are absolutely no moving parts

00:03:32.272 --> 00:03:37.088
yet we still don't have it figured out.

00:03:37.088 --> 00:03:38.217
That's crazy.

00:03:38.217 --> 00:03:39.806
Now think about rockets.

00:03:39.806 --> 00:03:44.318
If you had a million moveable parts on this wifi connection would you expect it to work?

00:03:44.318 --> 00:03:47.454
I wouldn't, but somehow rockets work.

00:03:47.454 --> 00:03:48.537
That's amazing.

00:03:48.537 --> 00:03:51.018
Space is hard, but we're doing it.

00:03:51.018 --> 00:03:52.560
Think about staging again.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.575
You compute your guidance and control algorithm based on a huge rocket to hit the right course.

00:03:56.575 --> 00:03:59.462
When you get to altitude you've got to stop one set of rocket engines,

00:03:59.462 --> 00:04:00.796
break the rocket in half,

00:04:00.796 --> 00:04:02.499
safely separate the two parts,

00:04:02.499 --> 00:04:04.883
recalibrate your entire guidance and control scheme,

00:04:04.883 --> 00:04:07.917
start another rocket engine and make sure that one's on the same track.

00:04:07.917 --> 00:04:11.313
Oh by the way your center of gravity just moved half way down your vehicle,

00:04:11.313 --> 00:04:13.751
you're doing this while you're on a collision course with the ground

00:04:13.751 --> 00:04:15.452
and you're going several times the speed of sound

00:04:15.452 --> 00:04:17.659
using materials that were the lightest you had available

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:21.260
and you shaved every single gram you could so you could get more payload to orbit.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.330
That's really hard.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.443
So what do these failures mean for human space flight.

00:04:24.443 --> 00:04:28.606
Well for one thing cargo vehicles are not human rated vehicles.

00:04:28.606 --> 00:04:32.110
Once you put a human on top of that rocket the rules change.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.808
For example a cargo vehicle might have two guidance computers

00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:37.671
but a human rated vehicle might have six.

00:04:37.671 --> 00:04:41.912
Human rated vehicles might have extra valves so you can isolate a problem with propellant.

00:04:41.912 --> 00:04:46.112
Another thing, the very top of a human rated system is often a launch abort system.

00:04:46.112 --> 00:04:49.754
If something goes squirrely with the big rocket you can just punch the launch abort system

00:04:49.754 --> 00:04:52.455
and it'll pull the capsule away, saving the humans.

00:04:52.455 --> 00:04:57.236
OK my words might not be right but I'm a little excited that these failures happened exactly when they did.

00:04:57.236 --> 00:04:58.098
And this is why.

00:04:58.098 --> 00:05:01.770
If you think about it, we are stressing the system in a way we did not anticipate.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.906
Three cargo vessels did not make it, that's a big deal.

00:05:04.906 --> 00:05:08.069
But everything's still working, so we have great mission planning .

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:11.205
We stressed the system in a way we didn't expect and it's working flawlessly.

00:05:11.205 --> 00:05:14.147
Number two, we're gonna uncover something right?

00:05:14.147 --> 00:05:15.682
We did something wrong.

00:05:15.682 --> 00:05:17.914
I don't know what it is but there might have been a weld that was wrong,

00:05:17.914 --> 00:05:19.578
we might have done something wrong procedurally,

00:05:19.578 --> 00:05:21.420
something is wrong.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.192
And we're gonna take a really stinking hard look at it

00:05:24.192 --> 00:05:27.227
right now, just before we transition to human flight

00:05:27.227 --> 00:05:28.993
and we're probably gonna be safer because of it

00:05:28.993 --> 00:05:31.423
because if these rockets had kept working every single time

00:05:31.423 --> 00:05:35.126
that flaw in the system or in that part would still be there

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.034
but it would remain uncovered.

00:05:37.034 --> 00:05:39.341
So it's a really good thing that it happened right now

00:05:39.341 --> 00:05:41.325
before we put humans on these rockets.

00:05:41.325 --> 00:05:45.712
So my grandfather worked on Apollo and my mom found something really cool this week in the basement.

00:05:45.712 --> 00:05:50.915
It is a coin made from materials that flew with Apollo 8 around the moon.

00:05:50.915 --> 00:05:51.656
Really cool.

00:05:51.656 --> 00:05:54.381
It comes with this letter from Frank Borman who was one of the astronauts

00:05:54.381 --> 00:05:57.452
thanking the people that made his rocket for their dedication to safety.

00:05:57.452 --> 00:05:58.658
Really really cool.

00:05:58.658 --> 00:05:59.758
Also there's this.

00:05:59.758 --> 00:06:04.398
It's a lunar landing celebration invitation from Dr Werner von Braun

00:06:04.398 --> 00:06:07.086
and if you zoom in here you can see what he says in closing.

00:06:07.086 --> 00:06:12.141
He says 'My greatest hope is that together we can work on ever greater ventures in the future'.

00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:14.377
That's exactly what the International Space Station is.

00:06:14.377 --> 00:06:15.308
It's a greater thing.

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:19.197
It transcends politics, it transcends language, it's just amazing.

00:06:19.197 --> 00:06:20.383
And so you've gotta ask yourself,

00:06:20.383 --> 00:06:23.636
in this situation, resupply vehicles fail,

00:06:23.636 --> 00:06:25.660
what would von Braun do?

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.208
And I think he would double down.

00:06:27.208 --> 00:06:31.232
I think he would realize that he could learn from mistakes in these resupply vehicles

00:06:31.232 --> 00:06:34.017
and roll that knowledge into the human space flight effort.

00:06:34.017 --> 00:06:35.689
And I'm really excited about that.

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:37.767
I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day.

00:06:37.767 --> 00:06:43.339
It was sponsored by audible.com where you can get a free audio book by going to audible.com/smarter.

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:45.006
I recommend Endurance by Alfred Lansing.

00:06:45.006 --> 00:06:50.640
I read this book because I saw a space station astronaut reading this book on one of the tours I watched online.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.877
Incredible parallels.

00:06:51.877 --> 00:06:54.845
They were stuck trying to cross Antarctica by land,

00:06:54.845 --> 00:06:56.380
they tried to resupply by boat, didn't work,

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.516
they had to survive on what they had.

00:06:58.516 --> 00:07:00.088
There's penguins that they would kill and eat.

00:07:00.088 --> 00:07:04.059
I'm not gonna telly you if they eat the dogs but it's an incredible book.

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:05.162
Anyway check it out.

00:07:05.162 --> 00:07:07.163
It's about Shackleton's incredible voyage.

00:07:07.163 --> 00:07:10.358
audible.com/smarter, Endurance by Alfred Lansing.

00:07:10.358 --> 00:07:12.929
I am Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:14.223
Have a good one.
