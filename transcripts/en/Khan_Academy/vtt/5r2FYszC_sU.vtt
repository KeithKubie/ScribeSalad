00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.150
A common house
spider has 8 eyes.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.070
If a spider is looking at
you with its 2 front eyes

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.849
and 3 of its other eyes,
what fraction of its eyes

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:16.640
are looking at you?

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.848
And just to show that we're
not making this stuff up,

00:00:18.848 --> 00:00:20.540
this is actually
pictures of spiders.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.290
And you see in every
one of these pictures

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:24.456
they have eight eyes, even
this one's got other eyes

00:00:24.456 --> 00:00:27.980
right over here-- 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.140
I never even realized this.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.450
This is actually quite creepy.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.070
But anyway, let's actually
focus on the problem.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.430
So it's looking at you
with 2 of its 8 eyes.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.420
So the 2 front eyes represent
what fraction of the eyes?

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.089
Well, it represents
2 of the 8 eyes.

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:49.630
You could look at
it right over here.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.449
You have 8 eyes.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:51.490
We have the 2 front eyes.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.110
That's 1 and 2 of the 8.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.270
And it says it's also looking
at us with 3 of its other eyes.

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.700
So it's also looking at
us with 3 of the 8 eyes.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.269
And so you can
imagine that might

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.527
be that one, that
one, and that one.

00:01:07.527 --> 00:01:09.235
So this is really
about adding fractions.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:12.460
This is about adding 2/8 of
something to 3/8 of something.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.380
So what fraction of its
eyes are looking at us?

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.770
Well, it's still going
to be a fraction of 8.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:28.120
It's going to be still out
of 8-- 2 plus 3 over 8,

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.280
which is just going to be
equal to 5/8 of the eyes.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.890
5 out of the 8 eyes
are looking at us.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.250
And we see it right over
here-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.770
5 of the total of 8
eyes are looking at us

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.128
in a fairly creepy way.
