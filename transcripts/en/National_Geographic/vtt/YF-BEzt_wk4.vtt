00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.469
Few years ago,
I was called into a meeting

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:03.737
a lunch meeting and

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:05.638
you know,
the Geographic told me

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:08.441
we're gonna do this
whole issue special

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.510 line:0%
on the Greater
Yellowstone Ecosystem.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.713 line:0%
And I was asked to
become one of the team.

00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:16.182
<i> And it's, you know,
 it's 50,000 square miles</i>

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:19.151
<i> Western Wyoming,
Southern Montana, Eastern Idaho.</i>

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:21.654
<i> Some amazing areas,
 Grand Teton,</i>

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:24.823
<i>it's the Wind River range,
 it's Yellowstone.</i>

00:00:24.823 --> 00:00:26.893
<i>It's got incredible wildlife.</i>

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:29.495
<i> Incredible opportunity
 to be asked to do this.</i>

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:31.330
So, I ended up,
as part of the project

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.699
I ended up getting the Tetons.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:34.200
<i> You know,
 if you go to the Tetons</i>

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.870
<i>at six o'clock in the morning
in October, it looks like this.</i>

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.272
<i>You know, it doesn't look like
the first frame of the Tetons</i>

00:00:40.272 --> 00:00:42.709
<i>actually, it's full of people.</i>

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.043
So, we had teams all over.

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:46.346
But, you know, there were
teams in Yellowstone

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:47.546
for the Yellowstone issue.

00:00:47.546 --> 00:00:51.151
But I got the south end of the
ecosystem, I got the Tetons.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.986
Which is great,
and you know

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:57.023
fantastic if you're a landscape
photographer, which I'm not.

00:00:57.023 --> 00:00:58.557
Um, because, you know

00:00:58.557 --> 00:01:00.293
you're basically charged
with photographing

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:01.961
A, the most beautiful
place in the world

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:04.363
B, the most photographed,
most iconic

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:06.732
I mean hell,
you've got the Tetons.

00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:10.336
And Ansel Adams,
the most famous

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:12.672
brilliant landscape
photographer there ever was

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:16.176
photographed one of his
most famous pictures here.

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.411
How the hell am I
gonna top that?

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:19.578
( audience laughter )

00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:21.948
That's easy, you know.
That's what I did.

00:01:21.948 --> 00:01:23.116
( audience laughter )

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:24.583
<i> Get someone else
 do it for me.</i>

00:01:24.583 --> 00:01:26.519
-( audience laughter )
-( Charlie Laughs )

00:01:27.687 --> 00:01:30.122
<i> The thing is right,
as a photographer, right.</i>

00:01:30.122 --> 00:01:31.357
You'll laugh at that.

00:01:31.357 --> 00:01:32.758
We all know what he's doing,
don't we?

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:34.393
We're all just a bit cynical,
it's kind of funny.

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:35.828
As a photographer,
I think

00:01:35.828 --> 00:01:37.864
"Why are you doing
it with a tripod?"

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:39.298
You know what I mean.

00:01:39.632 --> 00:01:43.202
"It's the middle of the day.
What on earth are you thinking?"

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:46.239
And I actually want to
form the tripod police.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:47.339
Because I live in Jackson.

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:50.043
I just wanted to go and batter
people to death with tripods.

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:53.146
Because there, it's like
lunchtime on a sunny day

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:54.681
and there's a man,
it's always a bloke

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:56.216
women are not that stupid.

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:58.284
There's always a
man photographing

00:01:58.284 --> 00:01:59.885
the Tetons with a tripod.

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:01.487
"What are you doing!"

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:02.789
Anyway...

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.890
I could go on about it
all night if you want--

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.627
Okay. So why did they,
so we've answered, yeah--

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:10.062
So, why did they send a
Brit to Yellowstone? Well,

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:11.898
<i> Amongst other things</i>

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:15.134
<i> I am, I guess an aquatic
 species specialist.</i>

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:16.969
<i> I shoot</i>

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:21.273
technically complicated photos
of mainly, fresh water animals.

00:02:21.273 --> 00:02:25.345
And that is such an
incredibly minute niche

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:27.012
that no one else has
bothered to do it.

00:02:27.012 --> 00:02:28.181
So I got it.

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:30.783
As you know, I like

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:32.985
( exaggerated pronunciation )
Otters.

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:34.253
( laughter )

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:37.823
If I say Otters in Wyoming,
everyone just looks at me and

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:40.126
just thinks I'm someone
from Downton Abbey.

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:42.595
So I have to say Otters

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:44.264
( audience laughter )

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:46.466
All the time.

00:02:46.466 --> 00:02:48.768
And then they look at me, "Why
are you taking piss out of us?"

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:51.236
So, I'm stuck between
a rock and a hard--

00:02:51.236 --> 00:02:53.839
First world problems.
Anyway, um...

00:02:54.306 --> 00:02:56.342
I'm an aquatic
species specialist.

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:57.810
I love Otters.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.846
So we do a lot of them,
they're part of the story.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.481
But, I use, sort of

00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.083
taking the techniques I've
learned shooting Otters

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:07.086
and have moved it on
to other animals.

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:09.388
<i>We all had a meeting in DC</i>

00:03:09.388 --> 00:03:12.325
<i>when we were sort of hatching
this Yellowstone article.</i>

00:03:12.325 --> 00:03:15.495
And we, well, one of the
visual mantras, I guess, was

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:19.365
"We want iconic landscapes
with animals in."

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:20.867
Which is great if you are...

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:23.702
Well, if you're an
underwater photographer

00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:24.770
what are you supposed to do?

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.405
( Charlie laughs )

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:29.709
Anyway, basically I turned
the first few weeks

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:30.910
into location scout.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.381
How can I get these animals
in landscapes underwater.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:36.816
And this is what
I ended up with.

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.186
<i>But, one of the reasons I like
this style of photography</i>

00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:43.089
<i>and, you know, this image,
 is because, up here</i>

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:46.192
up top right there, you
can see all the sticks.

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:49.261
That's, that's a beaver dam.
Right.

00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:52.531
And this beaver
and its relatives

00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:54.666
and its ancestors have created,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.436
they built that dam.

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:59.038
They've created this
entire water world

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:00.406
this entire ecosystem.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:02.208
They've engineered
the landscape.

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:04.477
And they've done
it at the foot of the Tetons.

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:07.580
So, for me, a picture like that
tells a much bigger story.
