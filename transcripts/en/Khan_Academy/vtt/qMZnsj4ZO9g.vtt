00:00:00.203 --> 00:00:01.501
- [Voiceover] Let's do some examples

00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:03.182
figuring out the magnitude of a vector

00:00:03.182 --> 00:00:05.472
if we're just given some
information about it.

00:00:05.472 --> 00:00:07.399
So, one of the simplest cases would be

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:09.982
well, if they just told
us the actual components

00:00:09.982 --> 00:00:10.870
of the vector.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.604
So if they said vector a is equal to,

00:00:14.604 --> 00:00:18.695
let's say five comma negative three,

00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:21.443
this means that its
x-component is positive five,

00:00:21.443 --> 00:00:23.970
its y-component is negative three.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.190
Well, if we have this,
then the magnitude of a,

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.281
the magnitude of a is just going to be,

00:00:30.281 --> 00:00:32.966
and this really just comes
from the distance formula

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:35.315
which just comes from
the Pythagorean theorem,

00:00:35.315 --> 00:00:36.991
the magnitude of a is just going to be

00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:38.265
the square root

00:00:38.265 --> 00:00:42.355
of the x-component squared.

00:00:42.355 --> 00:00:44.552
So let me do that in a different color.

00:00:44.552 --> 00:00:47.322
So the square root of
the x-component squared,

00:00:47.322 --> 00:00:49.655
so five squared,

00:00:49.655 --> 00:00:53.315
plus the y-component squared,

00:00:53.315 --> 00:00:56.538
so plus negative three squared.

00:00:56.538 --> 00:00:59.209
And this is going to be equal to

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:04.188
the square root of 25,

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:08.303
25 plus nine,

00:01:08.303 --> 00:01:10.313
plus nine,

00:01:10.313 --> 00:01:13.501
which is equal to the square root of 34,

00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:18.392
which is equal to the square root of 34.

00:01:18.492 --> 00:01:19.998
And if you want to think
about this visually,

00:01:19.998 --> 00:01:21.029
this is very easy to do

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:22.796
just looking at the actual components.

00:01:22.796 --> 00:01:24.072
But if you want to make sense of this,

00:01:24.072 --> 00:01:27.190
why this is essentially just
the Pythagorean theorem,

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.739
we could draw out a quick
coordinate axis right over here.

00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:33.499
So that's our y-axis.

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:35.221
This is our, let's see,

00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:37.051
I have a y-component of negative three.

00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:38.037
So let's see.

00:01:38.037 --> 00:01:41.257
That is our, actually let me
draw it a little bit different.

00:01:41.257 --> 00:01:42.522
Let me draw it like this.

00:01:42.522 --> 00:01:44.718
That is our x-axis.

00:01:44.718 --> 00:01:48.198
And we see its x-component
is positive five,

00:01:48.198 --> 00:01:52.926
so one, two, three, four, five.

00:01:52.926 --> 00:01:54.546
That's five there.

00:01:54.546 --> 00:01:56.884
And its y-component is negative three.

00:01:56.884 --> 00:02:00.254
So one, two, three.

00:02:00.254 --> 00:02:02.454
And so this is negative three.

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:05.915
And so we can draw this
vector with its initial point.

00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:07.588
Remember, we can always
shift around a vector

00:02:07.588 --> 00:02:09.849
as long as we don't change its
magnitude and to direction.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.665
We can start it at the origin,

00:02:11.665 --> 00:02:14.484
and make it go five in the x-direction

00:02:14.484 --> 00:02:17.208
and negative three in the y-direction,

00:02:17.208 --> 00:02:19.439
and so its terminal point
will be right over there

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.027
at the point five comma negative three.

00:02:22.027 --> 00:02:24.883
And so the vector, the vector,

00:02:24.883 --> 00:02:27.874
will look like this.

00:02:27.874 --> 00:02:29.353
And if we want to figure
out the magnitude,

00:02:29.353 --> 00:02:31.719
that's just the length of this line.

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:34.817
And what we can do is just
set up a right triangle

00:02:34.817 --> 00:02:38.960
where our change, our change in y

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.015
is this negative three right over here.

00:02:43.015 --> 00:02:44.422
That is our change in y.

00:02:44.422 --> 00:02:48.881
And our change in x is this positive five,

00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:50.366
is that positive five.

00:02:50.366 --> 00:02:51.941
And so this is a right triangle.

00:02:51.941 --> 00:02:54.035
Five squared plus,

00:02:54.035 --> 00:02:55.403
you could just view the absolute value

00:02:55.403 --> 00:02:56.473
of this side as three,

00:02:56.473 --> 00:02:58.544
so five squared plus three squared

00:02:58.544 --> 00:03:00.826
is going to be the hypotenuse squared.

00:03:00.826 --> 00:03:04.153
Comes straight out of
the Pythagorean theorem.
