David? &gt;&gt; So our initial state, is that each block is on top of the other.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.860
D is on B. B is on A. A is on C. And C is on the table. Our goal state,

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:11.750
is each block on top of the other in a different order,

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.290
an alphabetic order. So, A is on B. B is on C. And C is on the table. So

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.580
our initial state is that the blocks are all stacked up, D is on B, B is on A,

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.480
A is on C. C is on the table. And our goal state, is that the blocks are stacked

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.490
up in alphabetical order, so A is on B, B is on C, C is on D and D is on table.
