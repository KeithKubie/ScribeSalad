00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.870
We're asked to graph this
function, finding the roots

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.660
and the vertex of
this parabola.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.150
So to find the roots, when
people talk about roots,

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.870
they're talking about the points
of intersection of this

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.470
function and the x-axis.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.740
So this is the x-axis here,
and this is the y-axis.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.110
And you're going to intersect
the x-axis when

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.480
y is equal to 0.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.730
So to find the roots, we said
y is equal to 0, so we solve

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.230
the equation, x squared plus
4x minus 12 is equal to 0.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.750
All I did is I said y is equal
to 0, and I swapped the left-

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.270
and right-hand sides.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.080
Now, to factor this, we have a 1
as a leading coefficient, so

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.760
we don't have to do the
all out grouping.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.610
We can just think, are there two
numbers whose products are

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.850
negative 12, and if I
add them I get 4?

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:50.960
So let's think about it.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.060
It looks like 2, positive 6, and
negative 2 would work, if

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.600
I go through all of negative
12's factors.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.540
So this can be factored as x
plus 6, times x minus 2.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.310
6 minus 2 is 4.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.500
6 times negative 2 is negative
12, so that's going to be

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.520
equal to 0.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.840
And if we have two numbers,
and if, when you multiply

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.290
them, they equal 0, that means
that either x plus 6 is equal

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.490
to 0, or x minus 2
is equal to 0.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.600
Subtract 6 from both sides of
this equation, you get x is

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.430
equal to negative 6.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.790
Add 2 to both sides of this
equation, and you get x is

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.140
equal to 2.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.010
So y is equal to 0 when x is
equal to negative 6, or x is

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.910
equal to 2.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.680
So let's graph both
of those points.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.130
x is equal to negative 6,
y will be equal to 0.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.600
So x is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.600
So negative 6 comma 0.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.940
That will be on the graph of
this function, or the graph of

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.380
this parabola.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.360
And also the point,
x is equal to 2.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.680
So 1, 2.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.840
Just like that. x
is equal to 2.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.580
So this is the point 2, 0.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.360
Now to find the x value of the
vertex, there's actually

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.960
several ways of doing it.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.810
There is a formula that
gives it to you.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.480
But actually, the easiest way
to figure it out is it's

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.240
actually going to be the
midpoint between the two 0's.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.280
If you already figured out the
0's, the x value where the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.840
vertex was going to lie--
because the two 0's are always

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.630
symmetric around the axis of
symmetry, which is the same x

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.340
value as the vertex.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.760
You can just find the midpoint
of these two points, and that

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.500
will be the x value
of the vertex.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.900
So let's just do that.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.280
So if we take the midpoint, we
can literally just average

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.100
these two numbers.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.265
So negative 6 plus 2, over 2 is
negative 4 over 2, which is

00:02:44.265 --> 00:02:45.720
equal to negative 2.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.680
So the vertex is x is
equal to negative 2.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.780
And when x is equal to negative
2, what is y?

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.020
So x is the vertex, and then y
will be equal to negative 2

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.560
squared, is positive 4.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.570
4 times negative 2
is negative 8.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.840
And then we have a
minus 12 there.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.280
So 4 minus 8 gets us to negative
4, minus another 12

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.940
is negative 16.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.760
So the point negative
2, negative 16 is

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.500
going to be our vertex.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.330
So let me graph that.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.060
I think it's going to fall off
of this graph a little bit.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.470
So negative 2, and then we're
going to go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:34.750
7, 8, 9, 10 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.210
So it's going to be
right around here.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:37.830
We went off the graph paper.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:47.020
But negative 2 all the way
down to negative 16.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.630
So that right there
is the vertex.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.580
Negative 2, negative 16.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:52.550
All the way down here.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.540
We can even lower the y-axis.

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.250
And so if I were going to graph
the parabola, it would

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.690
look something like this.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.900
It would look something
like that.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.470
Just like that and obviously
it would keep going.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.980
Now, I figured out the vertex
in this problem just by

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.530
averaging the x values
of the two routes.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.700
That gave me the x value of the
axis of symmetry, which is

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.459
this right here. x is
equal to negative 2.

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.399
That's the axis around which
the parabola is symmetric.

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:21.860
The other way to figure out the
x value of the vertex, is

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.555
to use the formula, negative
b over 2a.

00:04:25.555 --> 00:04:29.800
So the x value of the vertex
is equal to negative b--

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.230
negative 4-- over 2 times a.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.860
a is 1, so over 2, which is also
going to give you x is

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.150
equal to negative 2.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.380
Now, the last way to solve for
the vertex is to complete the

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.790
square on this parabola
right here.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.710
So what we can do is
we can rewrite it.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.910
We can say this is y is equal
to x squared plus 4x.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.955
I'm going to put the
minus 12 out here.

00:04:57.955 --> 00:05:00.680
And what we want to do is add
and subtract the same number,

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.890
so I can express this
as a perfect square.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.230
So if I take 1/2 of 4x, or if I
take 1/2 of 4, I get 2 if I

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:08.440
square that.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.810
I could add a 4 here, and
then subtract a 4.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:18.110
And then what that does is it
turns this into x plus 2

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.940
squared, right? x plus 2
squared is x squared

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:21.570
plus 4x, plus 4.

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.160
We've seen that multiple
times.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.870
So you have x plus 2 squared.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.740
And then you have the minus
4 minus 12, minus 16.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.540
So this is just another
way of writing

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:31.910
this exact same function.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.790
But when you write it this way
you see that the lowest point,

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.300
this part of the function right
here is always positive.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.650
It's a quantity squared.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.100
The lowest value that
it can be is 0.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.040
But then it can only
go up from 0.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.840
So the lowest point, the lowest
y value we can take on,

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.650
is when this expression
right here is 0.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.990
And when that happens, the
y value is negative 16.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.070
Now, what x makes
this value 0?

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.580
Well, x equals negative
2 will make this 0.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:12.310
If you wanted to say, x plus 2
is equal to 0, this expression

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.170
right here is going to be 0 when
x plus 2 is equal to 0.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.460
Subtract 2 from both sides,
x is equal to negative 2.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.730
So that's another way to find
the vertex, all of them

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.380
equally valid.
