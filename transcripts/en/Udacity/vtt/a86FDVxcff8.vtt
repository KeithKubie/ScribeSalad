00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.732
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So when we see the word and, it means that both of these inequalities must be

00:00:03.732 --> 00:00:07.594
satisfied for the value of x. What I'm curious about is what changing this word

00:00:07.594 --> 00:00:11.306
to or does to the relationship between these two inequalities and how that's

00:00:11.306 --> 00:00:14.844
going to affect our number line, or our range of values that x is allowed to

00:00:14.844 --> 00:00:18.659
equal? Does it mean that neither of these inequalities needs to be satisfied?

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.412
Does it mean that only one of them at a time is allowed to be satisfied, not

00:00:22.412 --> 00:00:26.239
both? Does it mean that at least one of them needs to be satisfied, but that

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:29.827
both could be? Or does it mean that both of these inequalities need to be

00:00:29.827 --> 00:00:30.480
satisfied?
