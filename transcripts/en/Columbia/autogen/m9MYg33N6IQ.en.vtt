I said I'm on this one on the side of
the people that supported and continue

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:12.310
the people that supported and continue
 

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:15.180
the people that supported and continue
to support the project it certainly was

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:15.190
to support the project it certainly was

not meant to deter Palestinian

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:16.990
not meant to deter Palestinian
 

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:19.650
not meant to deter Palestinian
terrorists you don't exactly deter

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:19.660
terrorists you don't exactly deter

Palestinian terrorists with nuclear

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:21.730
Palestinian terrorists with nuclear
 

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:23.819
Palestinian terrorists with nuclear
bombs it's also more problematic to

00:11:23.819 --> 00:11:23.829
bombs it's also more problematic to
 

00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:28.259
bombs it's also more problematic to
deter proximate neighbors because of the

00:11:28.259 --> 00:11:28.269
deter proximate neighbors because of the
 

00:11:28.269 --> 00:11:32.490
deter proximate neighbors because of the
physical properties of nuclear of

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:32.500
physical properties of nuclear of
 

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.460
physical properties of nuclear of
nuclear weapons so if nuclear deterrence

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:35.470
nuclear weapons so if nuclear deterrence
 

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:37.889
nuclear weapons so if nuclear deterrence
is credible against anyone it's actually

00:11:37.889 --> 00:11:37.899
is credible against anyone it's actually
 

00:11:37.899 --> 00:11:40.590

credible more credible against the more

credible more credible against the more
 

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:44.040
credible more credible against the more
distant adversaries so the problem is

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:44.050
distant adversaries so the problem is
 

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:48.360
distant adversaries so the problem is
that you can't argue both sides of the

that you can't argue both sides of the
argument at the same time and I think

argument at the same time and I think
 

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.470
argument at the same time and I think
that equal caution should be exercised

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:55.480
that equal caution should be exercised
 

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.319
that equal caution should be exercised

in the region and hence now as we
 

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.310

us then is and we really don't know
 

00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:32.799
us then is and we really don't know
because for the longest time well I mean

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:32.809
because for the longest time well I mean
 

00:20:32.809 --> 00:20:34.090
because for the longest time well I mean
I guess the big question is well where

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:34.100
I guess the big question is well where
 

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.950

one of our closest allies in the region
 

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.389
one of our closest allies in the region
would not allow us even to conduct a

00:20:43.389 --> 00:20:43.399
would not allow us even to conduct a
 

00:20:43.399 --> 00:20:46.149

public opinion survey in Egypt right for
 

00:20:46.159 --> 00:20:49.680
public opinion survey in Egypt right for
over a decade we have tried to basically

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:49.690
over a decade we have tried to basically
 

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.909
over a decade we have tried to basically
test the pulse of the Egyptian

00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919
test the pulse of the Egyptian
 

00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:53.739
test the pulse of the Egyptian
population and year in and year out they

00:20:53.739 --> 00:20:53.749
population and year in and year out they
 

00:20:53.749 --> 00:20:55.899
population and year in and year out they
have kicked us out of the country and

00:20:55.899 --> 00:20:55.909
have kicked us out of the country and
 

00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:57.609
have kicked us out of the country and
allowed us to ask basic questions like

00:20:57.609 --> 00:20:57.619
allowed us to ask basic questions like
 

00:20:57.619 --> 00:21:00.009
allowed us to ask basic questions like
your age education basic demographics

your age education basic demographics
 

00:21:00.019 --> 00:21:01.810
your age education basic demographics
but you could not happen to public

is that in addition to our models of
 

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:30.909
is that in addition to our models of
democratization in addition to the

democratization in addition to the
 

00:21:30.919 --> 00:21:33.330
democratization in addition to the
variables that we have used to examine

these societies and those we've often
 

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.539
these societies and those we've often
focused at these domestic level factors

00:21:43.539 --> 00:21:43.549
focused at these domestic level factors
 

00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:46.450
focused at these domestic level factors
right how educated is the population how

into the argument that Islam and
democracy are incompatible where are the

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:02.990

these societies the

00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:06.279
these societies the
 

00:22:06.279 --> 00:22:08.190
these societies the
are all domestic level models of

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:08.200
are all domestic level models of
 

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:10.200
are all domestic level models of
democratization but there's another

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:10.210
democratization but there's another
 

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:11.639
democratization but there's another
layer that I argue that is very

00:22:11.639 --> 00:22:11.649
layer that I argue that is very
 

00:22:11.649 --> 00:22:13.409
layer that I argue that is very
important is that citizens themselves

00:22:13.409 --> 00:22:13.419
important is that citizens themselves
 

00:22:13.419 --> 00:22:17.159

evidence for this is comparing public
 

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.700
evidence for this is comparing public
opinion to help comparing the positions

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:22.710

more multilateral positions now that's
penetrated and that also is we find that

00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:53.760
penetrated and that also is we find that
 

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.220
penetrated and that also is we find that

at the elite level is most clear during
 

00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:57.170
at the elite level is most clear during
the Bush administration and we now find

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:57.180
the Bush administration and we now find
 

00:48:57.180 --> 00:48:59.030
the Bush administration and we now find
that that's this is penetrated to the

of the work that I've been doing so big
 

00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:10.520
of the work that I've been doing so big
the big question for me is is that has

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:04.210
on the Israeli side of this issue I
actually think that as I said I think

01:00:04.210 --> 01:00:04.220
actually think that as I said I think
 

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:06.700
actually think that as I said I think
that Israel right now is experiencing a

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:06.710
that Israel right now is experiencing a
 

01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:11.220
that Israel right now is experiencing a
period of of paralysis at the top and

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:11.230
period of of paralysis at the top and
 

01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:14.710
period of of paralysis at the top and
and I think that that also percolates

01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720
and I think that that also percolates
 

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:18.370
and I think that that also percolates
down on the level of creativity I think

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:18.380
down on the level of creativity I think
 

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:21.370
down on the level of creativity I think
that there are some areas where Israelis

01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:21.380
that there are some areas where Israelis
 

01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:23.640
that there are some areas where Israelis
the Israeli system continues to be very

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:23.650
the Israeli system continues to be very
 

01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:25.870
the Israeli system continues to be very
creative especially on the issue of

01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:25.880
creative especially on the issue of
 

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:29.380
creative especially on the issue of
prevention of the worst consequences but

01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:29.390
prevention of the worst consequences but
 

01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:32.800
prevention of the worst consequences but
whether it today remains as proactive as

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:32.810
whether it today remains as proactive as
 

01:00:32.810 --> 01:00:34.990
whether it today remains as proactive as
creative as it was for example in the

01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:35.000
creative as it was for example in the
 

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.460
creative as it was for example in the
1960s when Israel had an extraordinarily

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:38.470
1960s when Israel had an extraordinarily
 

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:41.710
1960s when Israel had an extraordinarily
extraordinary sophisticated diplomacy of

01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:41.720
extraordinary sophisticated diplomacy of
 

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:45.100
extraordinary sophisticated diplomacy of
forging alliances with the minorities in

questions as they were asked on the
 

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.220
questions as they were asked on the
institutionalization i think that's a

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:36.230
institutionalization i think that's a
 

01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:38.260

really good question i mean what i mean

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:38.270
really good question i mean what i mean
 

01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:39.520

Parliament and a parliamentary system I

01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:44.540
Parliament and a parliamentary system I
 

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:46.720
Parliament and a parliamentary system I
think in many ways actually in terms of

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:46.730
think in many ways actually in terms of
 

01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:48.910
think in many ways actually in terms of
diffusion or creativity whatnot of the

01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:48.920
diffusion or creativity whatnot of the
 

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.890
diffusion or creativity whatnot of the

as the most widely democratic although

01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:56.030
as the most widely democratic although
 

01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:58.150
as the most widely democratic although
probably this creates some of its own

01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160
probably this creates some of its own
 

01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.770
probably this creates some of its own
headaches but people do see that as a

01:01:59.770 --> 01:01:59.780
headaches but people do see that as a
 

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:02.830
headaches but people do see that as a

you see these debates in the Arab world
as well so that's so it's still not not

as well so that's so it's still not not
 

01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:12.880
as well so that's so it's still not not
clear exactly what's going to happen in

terms of how the institutionalization
 

01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:16.840
terms of how the institutionalization
will evolve but what we do know is that

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:16.850
will evolve but what we do know is that
 

01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:18.010
will evolve but what we do know is that
it's going to be some combination of

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:18.020
it's going to be some combination of
 

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:21.480
it's going to be some combination of

the the issue of the Muslim Brotherhood
 

01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:27.040
the the issue of the Muslim Brotherhood
I think is also an interesting one and I

01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:27.050
I think is also an interesting one and I
 

01:02:27.050 --> 01:02:28.900
I think is also an interesting one and I
think there's two issues going on here

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:28.910
think there's two issues going on here
 

01:02:28.910 --> 01:02:29.980
think there's two issues going on here
in addition to what should I just said

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:29.990
in addition to what should I just said
 

01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:31.480
in addition to what should I just said
about the pragmatics or the tactics of

about the pragmatics or the tactics of
 

01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:32.500
about the pragmatics or the tactics of
the Muslim Brotherhood I think we need

01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:32.510
the Muslim Brotherhood I think we need
 

01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:34.780
the Muslim Brotherhood I think we need
to be very careful here on the one hand

to be very careful here on the one hand
 

01:02:34.790 --> 01:02:37.510
to be very careful here on the one hand
we hypothesize a lot about what will a

we need to ask ourselves the alternative

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:38.690
we need to ask ourselves the alternative
 

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:40.540
we need to ask ourselves the alternative
question what is the alternative you're

01:03:40.540 --> 01:03:40.550
question what is the alternative you're
 

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:42.280
question what is the alternative you're
going to push them back underground and

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:42.290
going to push them back underground and
 

01:03:42.290 --> 01:03:44.410
going to push them back underground and
we already know that the factors that

01:03:44.410 --> 01:03:44.420
we already know that the factors that
 

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:46.390
we already know that the factors that
have radicalized these movements or push

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400
have radicalized these movements or push
 

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:50.140
have radicalized these movements or push
them to the radicalization tendency are

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:50.150
them to the radicalization tendency are
 

01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:52.059
them to the radicalization tendency are
the same factors that are going to block

01:03:52.059 --> 01:03:52.069
the same factors that are going to block
 

01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:54.460
the same factors that are going to block
them from power so this is this is the

01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:54.470
them from power so this is this is the
 

01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:55.900
them from power so this is this is the
dilemma right and so there's this

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:55.910
dilemma right and so there's this
 

01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:58.030
dilemma right and so there's this
assumption or this operating hypothesis

01:03:58.030 --> 01:03:58.040
assumption or this operating hypothesis
 

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.339

but if we ignore the Islamist problem or

01:04:00.339 --> 01:04:00.349
but if we ignore the Islamist problem or
 

01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:01.870
but if we ignore the Islamist problem or

it hasn't it's a bigger problem today

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:04.490
it hasn't it's a bigger problem today
 

01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:07.150
it hasn't it's a bigger problem today
than it was ten years ago and if you

01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:07.160
than it was ten years ago and if you
 

01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:09.250
than it was ten years ago and if you
continue to apply policies that are

01:04:09.250 --> 01:04:09.260

feeding into the problem I mean so so

01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240
feeding into the problem I mean so so
 

01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.059
feeding into the problem I mean so so
this is that this is the big dilemma or

01:04:16.059 --> 01:04:16.069
this is that this is the big dilemma or
 

01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:20.410
this is that this is the big dilemma or
the 800-pound gorilla in the room and so

01:04:20.410 --> 01:04:20.420
the 800-pound gorilla in the room and so
 

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:22.120
the 800-pound gorilla in the room and so
the question is you have to basically

01:04:22.120 --> 01:04:22.130

01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:24.880
the question is you have to basically
