00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 align:start position:0%
the consequence of that would be I mean
 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.970 align:start position:0%
the consequence of that would be I mean
that's<00:00:21.840><c> most</c><00:00:22.109><c> of</c><00:00:22.289><c> what</c><00:00:22.320><c> he</c><00:00:22.500><c> wrote</c><00:00:22.650><c> about</c><00:00:22.710><c> you</c>

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
that's most of what he wrote about you
 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.460 align:start position:0%
that's most of what he wrote about you
know<00:00:23.310><c> and</c><00:00:23.670><c> so</c><00:00:24.210><c> you'd</c><00:00:24.420><c> say</c><00:00:24.660><c> well</c><00:00:24.900><c> the</c><00:00:25.050><c> divine</c>

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 align:start position:0%
know and so you'd say well the divine
 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.349 align:start position:0%
know and so you'd say well the divine
symbol<00:00:26.010><c> of</c><00:00:26.130><c> masculinity</c><00:00:26.670><c> has</c><00:00:26.939><c> been</c>

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
symbol of masculinity has been
 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.359 align:start position:0%
symbol of masculinity has been
obliterated<00:00:27.710><c> well</c><00:00:28.710><c> so</c><00:00:28.920><c> then</c><00:00:29.070><c> what</c><00:00:29.250><c> do</c><00:00:29.310><c> you</c>

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 align:start position:0%
obliterated well so then what do you
 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.990 align:start position:0%
obliterated well so then what do you
expect<00:00:29.570><c> what</c><00:00:30.570><c> it</c><00:00:30.689><c> what's</c><00:00:31.260><c> gonna</c><00:00:31.470><c> happen</c><00:00:32.000><c> it's</c>

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
expect what it what's gonna happen it's
 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.940 align:start position:0%
expect what it what's gonna happen it's
gonna<00:00:33.210><c> that</c><00:00:33.630><c> means</c><00:00:33.809><c> masculinity</c><00:00:34.440><c> is</c><00:00:34.620><c> going</c><00:00:34.860><c> to</c>

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 align:start position:0%
gonna that means masculinity is going to
 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.869 align:start position:0%
gonna that means masculinity is going to
become<00:00:35.219><c> weak</c><00:00:35.460><c> and</c><00:00:37.219><c> especially</c><00:00:38.219><c> if</c><00:00:38.460><c> the</c><00:00:38.550><c> symbol</c>

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 align:start position:0%
become weak and especially if the symbol
 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.330 align:start position:0%
become weak and especially if the symbol
has<00:00:38.969><c> also</c><00:00:39.239><c> denigrated</c><00:00:40.050><c> right</c><00:00:40.379><c> which</c><00:00:40.770><c> it</c>

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
has also denigrated right which it
 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.750 align:start position:0%
has also denigrated right which it
definitely<00:00:41.850><c> is</c><00:00:42.290><c> so</c><00:00:43.290><c> what</c><00:00:44.129><c> that</c><00:00:44.250><c> means</c><00:00:44.520><c> is</c><00:00:44.730><c> that</c>

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
definitely is so what that means is that
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.819 align:start position:0%
definitely is so what that means is that
the<00:00:45.180><c> ideal</c><00:00:45.719><c> that</c><00:00:46.649><c> man</c><00:00:47.010><c> could</c><00:00:47.309><c> aspire</c><00:00:47.700><c> to</c><00:00:48.059><c> is</c>

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 align:start position:0%
the ideal that man could aspire to is
 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
the ideal that man could aspire to is
denigrated<00:00:49.829><c> and</c><00:00:50.629><c> well</c><00:00:51.629><c> then</c><00:00:52.550><c> with</c><00:00:53.550><c> your</c><00:00:53.760><c> ideal</c>

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 align:start position:0%
denigrated and well then with your ideal
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.139 align:start position:0%
denigrated and well then with your ideal
in<00:00:54.390><c> tatters</c><00:00:55.079><c> you're</c><00:00:55.949><c> weak</c><00:00:56.250><c> that's</c><00:00:56.820><c> that's</c>

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 align:start position:0%
in tatters you're weak that's that's
 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.270 align:start position:0%
in tatters you're weak that's that's
definitional<00:00:58.820><c> so</c><00:00:59.820><c> I</c><00:01:00.559><c> think</c><00:01:01.559><c> the</c><00:01:01.920><c> reason</c><00:01:02.250><c> that</c>

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
definitional so I think the reason that
 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.060 align:start position:0%
definitional so I think the reason that
men<00:01:03.090><c> have</c><00:01:03.300><c> been</c><00:01:03.480><c> responding</c><00:01:03.989><c> positively</c><00:01:04.439><c> to</c>
