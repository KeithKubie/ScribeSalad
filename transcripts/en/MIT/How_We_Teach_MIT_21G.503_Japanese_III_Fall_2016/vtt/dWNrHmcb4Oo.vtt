[NO SPEECH]

00:00:06.396 --> 00:00:10.280
TAKAKO AIKAWA: So we have
the daily grade system.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.840
This is so students are
supposed to practice, you know,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.770
online exercises by
themselves before the class.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.250
And then-- so we grade their
performance in class based--

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.490
and then based on
their performance,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.190
like the best performance is
going to be graded like 10.10.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.770
And then if students
just come to class

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.660
without any preparation, they
may get either six or seven

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.850
depending on the instructor.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.600
So daily grade system
is a great incentive

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.020
for students to practice
outside of the class

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.300
or before the class.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.420
So we had so-called interview
test twice for each semester.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.800
And what we do is actually
one to one kind of interview

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.000
setting, usually, like, five
to seven minutes, again,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.310
depending on the level.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.200
That-- what we do as teachers
kind of elicit some questions

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.330
so that student can
answer, you know,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.370
particular forms and
grammar patterns.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:27.320
So, the interview test, we
do like five to seven minutes

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.110
for each student.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.730
If you have like 50 students,
having interview test

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.460
itself is actually
a lot of work.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.570
We usually spend one day,
sometimes two days, actually.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.510
We like to give individually
feedback on their performance,

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.810
but that itself, again,
additional, like,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.240
two to three days,
we cannot afford it.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.370
So we usually get
just a point, not--

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.910
and then if there are some,
you know, specific issues,

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.640
say, like, you know,
some students are not

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.520
good at pronouncing
particular words,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.979
and then we provide
specific feedback.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.590
Otherwise, usually
we just spend--

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.190
we just give the point.
