00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.711
English folklore is filled with green people
– the Green Knight, green fairies, the Green

00:00:08.711 --> 00:00:10.770
Man and Jack-in-the-Green.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.339
Two of the smallest were the Green Children
of Woolpit.

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:18.300
It’s not precisely known when they first
appeared, but it seems to have been around

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:26.620
the reign of Stephen (1135-1154) or that of
Henry II (1154-1189).

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.960
One year during the harvest in the village
of Woolpit in Suffolk, England (about 10 miles

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.556
from Bury St. Edmunds), reapers working near
old wolf pits (deep ditches dug to trap wolves)

00:00:34.556 --> 00:00:38.170
discovered two apparently lost young children
– a girl and boy.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.570
The children had green-tinged skin, wore strange
clothes, spoke an unfamiliar language, were

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.040
siblings, the boy was younger, and both refused
to eat regular food like bread (at least at

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.040
first).

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.730
The children were eventually taken to the
local bigwig, Sir Richard de Calne, who was

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.890
equally baffled by them, though took them
into his household.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.699
Attempts were made to feed them for apparently
a couple days, but none were successful until

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.170
bean plants were introduced, which seemed
to be a familiar food to the children and

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.780
something they readily ate.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.470
However, the boy eventually became sick and
died.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.960
His older sister had no such problem and eventually
even lost the green tinge to her skin as her

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.920
diet became more diverse and time went on.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.070
She eventually learned English, was baptized,
and at some point took the name of Agnes Barre,

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.460
allegedly having married a diplomat, Richard
Barre.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.659
So once she learned English, what did she
have to say about where she came from?

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.549
There are two contemporary accounts, though
neither are first hand accounts and, unsurprisingly

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.940
from this, differ slightly in the telling.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.399
But the general story is that the people she
came lived in a place with no sun, but had,

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:44.710
to quote, “a degree of light like what is
after sunset…”

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.899
She and her brother wandered off one day when
they were tending their father’s cattle.

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.759
It was during this time that they discovered
a cavern that they subsequently became lost

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.119
in, finding their way out via following the
sound of bells.

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.680
When they emerged, they were mystified by
the extreme light from the sun and quickly

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.560
became lost and could not find the cavern
again.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.969
In their search, they were found as previously
described.

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.209
She also supposedly stated that a land of
light was apparently to be seen at a great

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.380
distance off from her home, which apparently
was called “St. Martin’s Land”.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.949
She also supposedly stated that a great river
separated her home from the land of light.

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:25.130
So is there any truth to any of this?

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.440
Two contemporary scholars recorded the story:
a Benedictine abbot, Ralph of Coggeshall,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.350
contributor to Chronicon Anglicanum, and William
of Newburgh, author of Historia rerum Anglicarum.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.639
Abbot Coggeshall named Sir Richard de Calne
himself as his source, noting “that he had

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.720
frequently heard the story” from him, while
the historian from Newburgh noted that he

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.010
believed the story because of “the weight
of so many and such competent witnesses.”

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.590
Assuming the story was true, many have hypothesized
as to the origin of the children and their

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.670
green color, most fancifully some conjecturing
that the children were aliens or that they

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.570
came from another dimension.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.820
Less far fetched, some have posited that arsenic
poisoning could account for the children’s

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.490
green coloring (as well as their lack of appetite
and the boy’s poor health).

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.820
Arsenic has been used in the production of
green dyes, and it will discolor the skin

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.590
in a green-dotted rash.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.250
However, if the children presented with a
rash, it seems unlikely the villagers would

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.810
so eagerly take them in rather than fear deadly
diseases like leprosy, measels and smallpox.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.150
A more likely cause of the tinge could be
chlorosis, a form of anemia characterized

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.650
by a greenish tint to the skin.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:37.120
Well-known in centuries past (even named by
16th century German doctor Johannes Lange

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.350
as “the disease of virgins”, with the
remedy according to him to have sex).

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.820
Fast-forwarding to the turn of the 20th century,
this was apparently not unheard of in poorly

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.530
nourished, overworked girls, with the treatment
eventually iron supplements.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.470
Going back to the green children, given the
tinge to their skin seems to have faded as

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.810
the girl began eating a more diverse diet,
this is commonly put forth as a reasonably

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.130
enough explanation for the odd coloring.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.350
But what about the girl’s supposed description
of where she came from?

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.190
As for the more fantastical elements, like
being from a “land with no sun”, this

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.160
is generally discounted given her young age
and likely vague memories later in life when

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.540
she was recounting the tale.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:22.200
It’s entirely possible she was simply remembering
a particularly cloudy time, not exactly uncommon

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.470
in England.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:26.880
As for the initial language barrier, it has
been proposed that the children were Flemish

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.810
immigrants and lived in Fornham, which was
also known as Fornham St. Martin and is only

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.820
two miles from Bury St. Edmunds.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.440
The church in St. Edumunds, in the 12th and
13th centuries, also had bells that were regularly

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.350
wrung.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.750
In addition, the River Lark runs near Fornham
St. Martin, and the area around Bury St. Edmunds

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.510
is riven with underground passages from flint
mines that had been in the area.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.150
That said, it is noteworthy that the Flemish
had been in the country and nearbye for a

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.980
while, and so some think it unlikely that
no one in Sir Richard’s household would

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:57.980
have recognized the children’s language.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:58.980
Furthermore, although there may be passages
nearer Woolpit, the major flint mines, Grime’s

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:59.980
Graves, are located 20 miles north of Bury
St. Edmunds.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:03.440
In rebuttal to the potential issues with them
being Flemish, proponents assert that the

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.980
children could have even been English but,
like many at the time, only spoke their village’s

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:11.380
unique dialect, many of which were unintelligible
to outsiders.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.370
Thus, perhaps most sensibly of all, historian
Derek Brewer in his 1998 book, The Colour

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.560
Green, states “The likely core of the matter
is that these very small children, herding

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.290
or following flocks, strayed from their forest
village, spoke little, and (in modern terms)

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.590
did not know their own home address.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.730
They were probably suffering from chlorosis,
a deficiency disease which gives the skin

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.950
a greenish tint, hence the term ‘green sickness’.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.530
With a better diet it disappears.”
