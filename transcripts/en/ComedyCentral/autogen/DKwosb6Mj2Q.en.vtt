00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380
and they slip out they reveal something
 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.190
and they slip out they reveal something
about myself but you'll never get inside

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200
 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.240
so I think we're running out of time and

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250
so I think we're running out of time and
 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.979
so I think we're running out of time and
I got to go clear some space in my

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989
I got to go clear some space in my
 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:16.470

bathroom to hang this guy but I think
 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.060
bathroom to hang this guy but I think
it's coming along pretty well

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070
 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:28.199
