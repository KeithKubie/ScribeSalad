00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.180
Recalling in something we have talked about before.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.000
We've always thought about images as being functions.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.450
Now the one of the best ways to visualize that this kind of

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.140
thing is looking into this height map that we've looked at before.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:17.440
Here of course you can see in the 3D height map edges appear as ridges.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.760
So if you look at it when it comes around, you can see the information that

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.480
basically let's you differentiate between this part of the image and that.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.150
Something we will come back, and again, hopefully connect up to what we have

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.360
looked at in the past to what we are talking about now.
