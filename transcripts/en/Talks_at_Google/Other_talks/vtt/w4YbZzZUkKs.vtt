00:00:02.265 --> 00:00:05.820
EVA KOR: Thank you very much
for those of you who have come.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.860
Thank you, Emily,
May, [INAUDIBLE],

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.930
and May's boyfriend--
what's his name?

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.070
AUDIENCE: Nam.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.760
EVA KOR: Nam.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.260
OK.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.540
All of you who helped
organize this event,

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.220
I am very pleased to be here.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.385
I can tell you, before
I begin my presentation,

00:00:28.385 --> 00:00:34.380
that I probably use Google
a minimum of 10 to 20 times

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.070
a day.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.060
Whatever I don't
know, I go to Google.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.250
If I don't know how to spell
it, I start spelling it,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.920
Google is going to
spell it for me right.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.900
But I have to be close to a
computer, because my iPhone

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.860
I use for writing and sending
messages-- emails, or tweets,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.785
or whatever-- but Google helps
me with all the information.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.540
I usually like to
start my presentation

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.720
with the following statement.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.060
My name is Eva Kor.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.060
I am a survivor of Auschwitz, a
survivor of medical experiments

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.200
conducted by Doctor Mengele,
and now that I am 81 years old,

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.390
I am trying to survive old age.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.460
And I am finding it a bigger
challenge than I realized.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.850
I was born in a tiny village in
1934 in Transylvania, Romania.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.500
Being born in the 1930s
or '40s a Jewish child,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.100
my destiny was decided
already, because Hitler already

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.750
was in power in 1933.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.810
Our village had 100
families, all Christian,

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.750
except the Mozes
family was Jewish.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.640
And from the time that I
was six years old, when

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.290
the war started, and the village
was occupied by the Hungarians,

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.720
persecution against
Jews began immediately.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.930
And I learned that children can
be very mean to one another,

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.080
particularly if they are taught
to do so, and rewarded for it.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.610
By first grade when we entered,
we were called dirty Jews,

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.380
and the kids beat my
twin sister, Miriam, up.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.760
And when we complained
to the teacher,

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.940
the teachers punished us.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.550
So we learned within the
first few days in school

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.500
that there was no help for us.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.710
When we went home, I expected
my mother to march to school

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.090
and straighten it all out.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.480
But even though she was
a wonderful human being--

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.860
she hugged us, kissed
us, and cried with us--

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.420
but said, children,
I am very sorry.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.670
There is nothing I can do.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.530
You have to learn
that we are Jews,

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.810
and you have to
learn to take it.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.200
My father's attitude was
a little bit different.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.530
He told us since we
were going to school,

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.750
to be the best students in
that one room schoolhouse,

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.380
and we were.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.590
When we got home,
he said we needed

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.780
to help with the work
around the big pig farm.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.080
And at night, he said
you say your prayers.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.730
And he was very
strict about that,

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.290
because we were Orthodox Jews.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.950
And he said God is going to help
us, and everything will be OK,

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.790
and do not worry.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.040
And, of course, I believed
it, but as time went on,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.760
things changed.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.920
Every six months or
so, new rules, new laws

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.110
were passed against us.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.790
And in 1942, when I
was eight years old,

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.240
is that new laws that year
were that Jews could not

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.560
hire anybody but Jewish people.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.230
And in our Christian village,
that was not possible.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.770
My mother got sick.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.430
We tried to help--
the four girls--

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.110
but we couldn't handle all the
work on an old fashioned farm.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.500
My father asked for a permit
to travel to the big city

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.380
to try to hire a Jewish
lady, but that was denied.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.880
So here I was eight years old,
and our life was very, very

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.410
difficult. And so
I told my father,

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.520
daddy, I think time
has come that we

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.770
should escape to Romania.

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.210
The Romanian border was just
one hour by foot from our house,

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.530
and the rumor was that
life for Jews in Romania

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.490
was much better.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.320
And it turned out
it was correct.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.465
Romania refused to let
Germany pick up the Jews.

00:04:48.465 --> 00:04:51.820
They said, oh, we will take care
of them in our ghettos here,

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.910
but you cannot take them away.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.470
So all of the Jews
of Romania survived.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.435
But my father said
to me, you are just

00:04:59.435 --> 00:05:01.150
a little girl, eight years old.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.890
What on earth do you understand
about the big issues in life?

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:13.580
I have a theory that children
between the ages of six and 13,

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:18.610
or 12, are a lot smarter than
parents give them credit.

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.180
After 13, the
hormones set in, and I

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.360
don't know what happens to
all of these smart, wonderful

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.110
children.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.360
But I can explain it to you why.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.970
Children between six and
12 function by instinct.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.090
They do not
rationalize everything

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.120
that's going around-- do not
try to figure it out rationally.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.540
And I could sense it in
every ounce of my being

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.790
that things were
getting very bad.

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:52.630
But my father said to me,
you are just a little girl.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:53.880
You don't understand it.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.050
We have a nice home.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.790
We have plenty of food.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.340
You children go to school.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.880
And then he
rationalized, I think,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.450
and the Nazis won't come.

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.750
The Germans won't come
to this tiny village

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.295
to pick up six Jews.

00:06:09.295 --> 00:06:15.500
Well, daddy, I am eternally
sorry that you were 100% wrong,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.780
and I, as a eight-year-old
kid, was 100% right.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.560
I sure wish it was
the other way around.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.980
So in March of 1944, we were
taken to a regional ghetto.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.740
Two and a half months
later-- last week of May--

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.670
we were herded into cattle cars,
traveling for about four days

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.670
without food, without water.

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.650
It was very hot in
those cattle cars.

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.790
And we arrived in Auschwitz.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:48.220
Of course, we didn't know
where we were being taken.

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.590
The cattle car doors opened.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.380
Thousands of people poured out
onto a little strip of land

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.560
called the selection platform.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.690
In my opinion, there
is no other strip

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.780
of land like the selection
platform-- measuring

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.270
85 feet long by 35
feet wide-- that

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.310
witnessed as many millions
of people being ripped apart

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.760
from their families forever.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.530
So as we were standing there,
my mother grabbed my twin sister

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.470
and me by the hand.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.040
We were her youngest
children, and she

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.480
hoped that as long as she could
hold onto us, that somehow

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.240
she could protect us.

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.800
Everything was moving very fast.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.640
And I-- my childish
curiosity-- I looked around,

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.520
trying to figure
out what on earth

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.670
is this place, when I realized
that my father and two older

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:53.910
sisters disappeared
in the crowd.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.500
Never ever did I see them again.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.220
As we were holding onto
Mother for dear life,

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:03.540
a Nazi was running, yelling
in German, twins, twins.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.360
We did not volunteer
any information.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.840
He noticed us.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.700
Miriam and I looked alike,
and we were dressed alike,

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.790
and he demanded to know from
my mother if we were twins.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.190
And my mother didn't
know what to say.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.970
She asked, is that good?

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.730
And the Nazi nodded yes,
and my mother said yes.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:26.410
At that moment, we were
pulled in one direction,

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.710
my mother was pulled in
the opposite direction.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.730
We were crying, she was crying.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.600
And that was the
last time I saw her.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.694
I didn't even understand
that that would happen,

00:08:38.694 --> 00:08:42.850
because I might have done
something to run back

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:45.640
to my mother and say goodbye.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.410
We became part of a group
of little girls, all twins.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:53.620
In our group, there were
13 sets of little girls

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.730
between the ages of two and 16.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:01.540
And one mother, who had
seven-year-old twins-- and she

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.810
was my mother's friend.

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:04.975
Her name was Mrs. [? Jangary ?].

00:09:04.975 --> 00:09:09.360
We were taken to a big
building for processing,

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.590
which took the whole
day-- basically,

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:15.540
sitting naked, and not knowing
what would happen to us.

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.960
Finally the processing began.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.550
We were given short haircuts.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:25.840
Our dresses were returned with
a huge red cross on the back,

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:30.100
and we were tattooed
by heating a needle

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.780
over the flame of a lamp.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.500
And when the needle got hot,
they dipped it into ink,

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.520
and they burned
into my left arm,

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:44.450
dot by dot, the
capital letter A-7063.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:49.160
Miriam became capital A-7064.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.620
Auschwitz was the only Nazi
camp that tattooed its inmates.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.380
My husband is a survivor of
four years in Buchenwald.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.540
He does not have a tattoo.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.420
Once we were processed, we
were taken to our barrack.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:10.550
Crude and filthy
modular horse barns.

00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:12.570
There were no windows.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:16.760
We were given bunk beds on
the bottom that were covered

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.240
with a thin straw mattress.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.750
And we finally thought, after
four days in the cattle car,

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:26.120
that we could stretch
out and maybe sleep.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:31.380
But human beings cannot function
after such a traumatic day.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:33.920
So I kept tossing and
turning, and as I did,

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.480
I noticed something big and
dark moving on the floor.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:41.260
And I counted them, and when I
got to five, I said to myself,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:44.780
these are the biggest mice
I have ever seen, and began

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.190
screaming, "Mice."

00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:50.600
A girl from the top bunk said,
silly kid, these are not mice,

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.210
they are rats.

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:54.670
You better get used to them,
because they are everywhere.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:56.390
And they were.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.940
So now I couldn't even
try to go back to sleep.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.190
I went to the latrine.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.560
And as I entered
the place, there

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.580
on the filthy latrine floor
were the scattered corpses

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.650
of three children.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:15.430
I have never ever seen
anybody dead before.

00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:20.060
But the message to me was
clear that in this place,

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.430
children were dying.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:26.560
So right then and there
I made a silent pledge,

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.480
that I will do anything and
everything within my power

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.180
to make sure that Miriam
and I shall not end up

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:35.930
on that filthy latrine floor.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:40.145
That we will somehow survive,
and walk out of this camp

00:11:40.145 --> 00:11:41.580
alive.

00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:44.620
And I even had an
image in my mind

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:49.120
of how Miriam and I might
look when we walked out

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.030
of this camp alive.

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:56.600
Our daily routine-- we would
be awakened every morning

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.640
at 5:00 AM.

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.670
By 6:00 AM we were
outside for roll call.

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:02.430
And I can tell you
that by the time

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:07.880
it was winter of 1944,
'45, [INAUDIBLE],

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:11.960
my dress was filled with
holes, and so were my shoes.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.930
We did not get any
winter clothes.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.180
I have no idea how
we survived it.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:25.020
Just for the sake of getting
through my lecture faster,

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:29.570
I will just give you a
description of our experience

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:30.480
in the barrack.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.830
We were mostly little girls.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:38.520
At one time 200,
300, 400, depending

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.120
on how many [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:46.060
We were little girls between
the age of two and 16,

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:52.105
huddled in our filthy bunk beds,
crawling with lice and rats.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.910
We were starved for food.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:58.640
We were starved
for human kindness.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.820
And we were starved for
the love of the mothers

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:04.300
and fathers we once had.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:09.620
We had no rights, but we
had a fierce determination

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.450
to live one more day.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.770
To survive one more experiment.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.870
The experiments were
run six days a week,

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.780
and I was used in two
types of experiments.

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:25.230
Three days a week, we
would be placed naked

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.750
in a room for up to eight hours.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:31.320
And they would measure just
about every part of my body,

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.210
and compare it to
my twin sister,

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.690
and compare it to charts.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:40.310
These were not dangerous,
but even in Auschwitz I

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.010
had difficulty
coping with the fact

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:47.530
that I was reduced to the lowest
form of humanity in existence,

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.606
just a mass of breathing cells.

00:13:50.606 --> 00:13:54.400
On alternate days-- on Tuesday,
Thursday, and Saturday--

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:58.360
we would be taken to another
lab that I call the blood lab.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.120
There they would
tie both of my arms

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:04.440
to restrict the blood
flow, take a lot of blood

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:08.330
from my left arm, and give me
a minimum of five injections

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.180
into my right arm.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:12.910
Those were the deadly ones.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:18.730
The rumor was, in Auschwitz,
that these contained

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.660
drugs, diseases, and germs.

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.460
And that is probably a
pretty good assumption.

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.350
But we do not know
up to today what

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.960
was the content of
those injections,

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.160
nor what was the scope
of the experiments.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.682
After one of those
injections I became very ill

00:14:38.682 --> 00:14:44.380
with a very high fever, a fact
I desperately tried to hide.

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:47.070
My next visit to the
blood lab, instead

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:50.880
of tying my arms for blood
taking and injections,

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.240
they measured my fever, and
I knew I was in trouble.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.140
I had a very high fever.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.670
I was trembling
in the August sun.

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:04.200
My arms and legs were very
swollen, and very painful,

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:09.340
and I had huge red spots
throughout my body.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.690
The hospital was
another barrack,

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:16.590
but filled with people who
looked more dead than alive.

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:20.430
Next morning, Mengele came
in with four other doctors.

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:22.660
He never ever examined me.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:25.000
Just looked at my fever
chart, and then he

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.400
declared, laughing
sarcastically, saying,

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.160
too bad, she's so young, she
has only two weeks to live.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.500
I knew he was right,
but I refused to die.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.900
So I made a second
silent pledge that I

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.390
will prove Mengele wrong.

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:45.850
I will survive, and be
reunited with my twin sister.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:50.410
For the following two weeks,
I have only one clear memory.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:53.330
I remember crawling
on the barrack floor,

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.530
because I no longer could walk.

00:15:55.530 --> 00:15:59.330
And I was crawling to reach the
other end of the barrack, where

00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:04.140
there was one faucet with water,
because this barrack was not

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.190
even allocated water.

00:16:06.190 --> 00:16:08.600
People were brought
there to die.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.920
And as I was crawling,
I would fade in and out

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.400
of consciousness, and I
kept telling myself-- even

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:21.930
in a semiconscious state
of mind-- I must survive.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:23.500
I must survive.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.400
After two weeks, my fever
broke, and I immediately

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.390
felt a lot stronger
and a lot better.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:34.420
It took me another three weeks
before my fever chart showed

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:39.360
normal, and, amazingly, I
was released and reunited

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.680
with my twin sister,
and the other twins.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:48.120
But Miriam looked very sick,
and I could not understand that.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:55.290
In Auschwitz, as I often
say, dying was very easy.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.960
All around us was deaths.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:01.600
Surviving was a full time job.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:06.170
And the way that became
dangerous-- the dangerous sign

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:13.540
was-- if somebody would sit
and stare into space aimlessly,

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.880
that was a sign that
they have given up

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.650
their struggle,
because everybody

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.380
struggled to live one more day.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.720
And that is the
way Miriam looked,

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.190
and I was very surprised.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.700
And I said, what on
earth happened to you

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.070
in the five weeks that
I was in the hospital?

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.460
She said, I cannot
talk about it.

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.470
I will not talk about it.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:39.620
And Miriam and I never talked
about Auschwitz until 1985.

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:43.550
The word Auschwitz never
came up in our conversation.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:50.970
And my opinion is that children
who struggle for their life,

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:55.020
they cannot go back
to the experience,

00:17:55.020 --> 00:18:00.570
because they have to feel
safe even as grownups.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:04.990
And that feeling of
safety is very important,

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.480
and it's very
difficult to come by,

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:11.620
if their safety was
violated as children.

00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:16.690
And second thing is that
most survivors of atrocities

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:20.520
are afraid if they talk about
it, they will fall apart.

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.740
My experience has been
that I have only remembered

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.400
as much as I could cope with.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.520
So I said to Miriam, when
we talked about it in 1985,

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.160
I said, do you remember when
I was taken to the hospital?

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.720
She said, yes.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.320
I said, what happened to you
while I was in the hospital?

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:44.430
Because there are no books
written about our experiments.

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:47.270
She said, well, for
the first two weeks,

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:51.560
I was kept in isolation, and
they were waiting for something

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.080
to happen.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.710
I don't know what that was,
because they didn't tell me.

00:18:55.710 --> 00:18:58.880
And I don't know if it
happened, or it didn't happen.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.880
But it was the same two weeks
that Mengele said I would die.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.390
I told Miriam, I
spoiled the experiment.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:08.640
I survived.

00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.840
Would I have died,
Miriam would have

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:13.675
been rushed to Mengele's
lab, killed with an injection

00:19:13.675 --> 00:19:16.390
to the heart, and then
Mengele would have

00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:18.780
done the comparative autopsies.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:22.920
That information comes to me
from the Auschwitz Museum,

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:25.560
where they also
told me that Mengele

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:32.540
used 1,500 sets of twins-- 3,000
individuals in the experiments.

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:36.490
The estimated number of
survivors is 250 individuals.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.800
Then I asked her
what happened to her

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.230
after the two weeks were up.

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:46.180
She said she was injected
with many injections that

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.386
made her feel very sick.

00:19:48.386 --> 00:19:54.480
After the war, Miriam was always
weaker and sicker than I was.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.070
She got married
in 1958 in Israel.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.950
Expected her first
baby in 1960, and she

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:04.260
developed severe kidney
infections that did not

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.780
respond to any antibiotic.

00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:10.290
Second pregnancy
in '63 got worse,

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:13.180
and this time the Israeli
doctors studied her,

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:16.000
and they found out that
Miriam's kidneys never

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.290
grew larger than the size
of a 10-year-old child.

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:24.670
I begged Miriam not to
have any more children.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:27.760
And I said, you have two
children, that's pretty good.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.430
But she had a third one, and
after her third child was born,

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:33.240
her kidneys were deteriorating.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:39.080
And by 1987 she needed
to go on dialysis,

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.180
or have a kidney transplant.

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.930
Well, she didn't want
to live on dialysis.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:45.320
I had a simple choice.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.680
I had two kidneys, one sister.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:50.550
Of course I donated
one of my kidneys,

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:52.870
and we were a perfect match.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.870
At that hospital
near Tel Aviv, they

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:59.170
had been doing kidney
transplants for 10 years,

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:06.050
and they had 200
survivors-- 2,000 survivors.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:11.000
And all of them were given
anti-rejection medication.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.610
None of them developed
cancerous polyps like Miriam

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.140
did a year after the transplant.

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:19.830
And the doctors told
me that I should

00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:23.070
try to find our files from
Auschwitz, because there

00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:26.770
had to be something in
her body that was injected

00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.630
in the camp that combined with
the anti-rejection medication

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.730
to create the cancer.

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:35.100
We never found our files.

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:42.010
Miriam's cancer metastasized,
and she died June 6, 1993.

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:43.660
I will take you
back to the camp,

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.490
because it's important
for me to describe

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:52.040
to you my state of mind as
a 10-year-old in Auschwitz.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:57.910
I thought that the whole world
was one big concentration camp.

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.380
That everybody is
the world lived

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:03.230
like I lived, in
miserable conditions,

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:06.080
without famillies,
starving to death,

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:09.080
and guarded by
guards day and night.

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:13.430
Until end of August,
there was an airplane

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.270
that appeared over the
skies of Auschwitz.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:21.320
It was flying really low, and
I could see the American flag

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.550
on one of the wings.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:28.930
That gave me hope that
somebody was trying to free us.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:33.656
And hope in Auschwitz
was in very short supply.

00:22:33.656 --> 00:22:37.000
The air raids continued
and increased.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.840
And by November of 1944,
it felt like a full fledged

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:47.100
battlefield-- continuous
air raids, artillery,

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.535
all the experiments stopped.

00:22:48.535 --> 00:22:52.580
Anyways, the children
developed a daily slogan

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:56.810
that someday soon we will be
free, and we will go home.

00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:02.160
Except we had no idea
how that would happen.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.610
In early January,
the Nazis told us,

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:07.395
everybody out of the barracks.

00:23:07.395 --> 00:23:09.920
We are taking you
deep into Germany

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.380
to protect you
from the fighting.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.340
In my childish mind, I
didn't like the Nazi guards

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:18.260
when they were winning
the war, so I really

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:21.030
didn't want to be near them
when they were losing it,

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:24.370
and we decided to
stay in the barrack.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:27.550
And I think-- as I
talked a few months ago--

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.890
a few years ago to
a survivor-- I said,

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:33.370
why did you go out
on the death marches?

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:37.590
And they came in with their
guns, and pointed at our heads.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.220
Well, no one came
in to our barracks,

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.890
so I guess I had
a guardian angel.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:47.630
Next morning we woke up,
opened the barrack doors.

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:49.730
All the Nazis were gone.

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:55.020
We were on our
own-- about 8,500,

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.280
according to the
Auschwitz Museum.

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:04.730
And then the Nazis came
back on January 18, 1945,

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:10.360
to march us to Auschwitz,
and try to eliminate as much

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.820
of the evidence as they could.

00:24:13.820 --> 00:24:20.350
What I learned that they were
also killing without any rhyme

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:24.410
or reason, because there
was a group of us-- 200

00:24:24.410 --> 00:24:28.440
in the kitchen-- and
when we went outside,

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:32.350
the machine guns
were just killing

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:33.995
without any rhyme or reason.

00:24:33.995 --> 00:24:37.530
And what I remember
was a barrel of the gun

00:24:37.530 --> 00:24:39.320
about three feet from my head.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:42.730
And I think that when I
woke up, I looked around

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:45.450
and I was surrounded
by dead bodies.

00:24:45.450 --> 00:24:47.250
And when I reached
out and touched

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:50.305
one of the girls next
to me, she was ice cold.

00:24:50.305 --> 00:24:54.120
And this is when I realized
that I was still alive.

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:58.250
They marched us from
Birkenau Auschwitz II

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:01.550
to Auschwitz I in the
middle of the night.

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:06.260
When we arrived there, the Nazis
were not willing to give up,

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.530
and the Allies were right
outside the city limits,

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:12.350
so they couldn't
take us any further.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:15.270
Heavy fighting was raging
for the next nine days.

00:25:15.270 --> 00:25:18.200
My biggest problem in
Auschwitz I was there

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.000
was nothing to drink.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.220
And we were very
smart survivors.

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.520
There was no snow on the ground.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.350
We would have melted the
snow and boiled the water.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:32.670
So in sheer despair one day,
I went to the nearby river.

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:36.580
I broke the ice, lowering a
container tied to a string,

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.750
and when I looked up,
I saw a little girl

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:43.310
with braided hair, dressed
in beautiful, clean clothes,

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:45.450
and she was carrying
a school bag.

00:25:45.450 --> 00:25:48.750
That was my first
realization that there

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:51.390
was a world beyond
the camp where

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:56.290
children looked like
children, and went to school.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.560
A few days later,
it was very quiet.

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.480
Eerily quiet.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:05.450
I thought, well, maybe this
will be the day we will be free.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:07.125
We didn't know how.

00:26:07.125 --> 00:26:12.550
It was late in the afternoon
of January 27, 1945.

00:26:12.550 --> 00:26:15.180
A woman ran into
the barrack yelling

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.150
at the top of her
voice, "We are free.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:19.582
We are free.

00:26:19.582 --> 00:26:21.910
We are free."

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:25.862
It was a wonderful
event to hear,

00:26:25.862 --> 00:26:27.570
but I didn't know
whether or not she knew

00:26:27.570 --> 00:26:29.290
what she was talking about.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.850
Because when I looked down
from the second story,

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:33.990
I couldn't see anything.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:36.970
I said, does she really
know what she is saying?

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:39.650
So we went downstairs.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:43.830
It was snowing heavily,
and it took me 30 minutes

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:48.775
to get my eyes and vision
adjusted to the falling snow.

00:26:48.775 --> 00:26:53.220
Where at a distance I
could see lots of people.

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:57.220
They were all wrapped in
white camouflage raincoats.

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.300
They were smiling
from ear to ear.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.150
And the most important
thing, for me,

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:05.020
was that they didn't
look like the Nazis.

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.550
So we ran up to them.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:09.990
They gave us chocolate,
cookie, and hugs.

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:12.390
And this was my first
taste of freedom.

00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:16.610
For me to realize that
Miriam and I were alive.

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:22.230
That my little promise to myself
that first night in the latrine

00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:24.230
became a reality.

00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:28.330
And that was an
unbelievable experience.

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:33.230
I want to say thank you
all for listening to me.

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:40.470
And today's lecture
is 134 this year.

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:42.210
Which means,
basically, the reason

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:44.740
I'm telling you
that I talk a lot.

00:27:44.740 --> 00:27:45.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.260
And why do I talk so much?

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:52.030
Because I have learned some very
important lessons in my life

00:27:52.030 --> 00:27:54.310
that I call them
life lessons, and I

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:56.110
want to share them with you.

00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:58.430
Life lesson number one.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:02.720
Never ever give up on
yourself, or on your dreams.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:06.430
If you give up,
nothing will happen.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:10.560
And as I look at many
of your young faces,

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:16.490
I realize I remember
growing up is very hard.

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:21.580
And it's very hard even if
you live in the United States,

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:24.130
and even if you
have loving parents.

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:26.520
And what a thought that is.

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:29.450
That every child
in the world would

00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:31.440
be born to loving parents.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.470
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:36.800
And even if your loving
parents have enough money

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:40.550
to buy you jeans
with holes in them--

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:42.360
I don't know why
that is so important,

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:49.190
but I know it's more expensive--
and even if they can buy you

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:52.740
all the modern
gadgets, even then,

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.510
every single one if you
wonders how on earth

00:28:56.510 --> 00:29:00.680
do I fit into this big,
big mixed up world.

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:05.630
Will I be able to accomplish
in life what I set out to do?

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:09.600
And I can tell you that
if you keep hammering away

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.710
at your wonderful
minds-- and you

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:18.460
have lots of wonderful minds
working here at Google--

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:19.870
will give you an answer.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:23.880
I had no idea how to
survive Auschwitz.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:30.050
And here I am 70 years later,
very happy that I am alive.

00:29:30.050 --> 00:29:33.890
Life lesson number two
deals with prejudice.

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:37.460
One of the reasons that
Adolf Hitler and the Nazis

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.780
rose to power, it
was a bad economy.

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:43.870
And once Hitler convinced
his fellow Germans

00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:48.340
to vote for him-- and he
had only 1/3 of the vote,

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:53.450
but somehow he became
chancellor of Germany.

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:57.510
Instead of taking care
of the economic problems,

00:29:57.510 --> 00:30:02.270
he decided it would be a lot
faster to blame it on somebody,

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:08.720
and Jews were always a good
group of people to blame it on.

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.790
And many of the Germans
accepted the fact,

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:17.100
because for centuries--
generations--

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:21.410
Jews were always used as
the scapegoats for all

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:23.330
the problems in the world.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:25.580
And they are used again.

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:30.590
Just yesterday I got on Twitter
a piece of information that

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:35.260
Angela Merkel asked
many Jews in Germany--

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:40.140
as Rosh Hashanah and the high
holy days are approaching--

00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:43.030
not to go to the synagogue,
because they might be

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:47.290
firebombed, and they
cannot protect them all.

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:51.730
So in 70 years, I don't
see how much has changed.

00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:57.390
And in many countries in
Europe that is a problem.

00:30:57.390 --> 00:31:03.340
Prejudice-- I call prejudice
a cancer of the human soul.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.980
It destroys the people
who practice it,

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:10.090
and it destroys
everything in its sight.

00:31:10.090 --> 00:31:11.750
But that's what Hitler used.

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:16.870
And prejudice, as we look around
in the world today, is rampant.

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:19.190
Now I will tell
you, I will confess

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:21.370
to the fact that
I am prejudiced,

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:25.450
but not against any race,
religion, or ethnic group.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:28.420
I basically don't like
the torn-- the jeans

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.935
with the holes in them.

00:31:29.935 --> 00:31:31.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:34.460
And I don't like the sloppy
appearances of people.

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:40.100
And I know that here at
Googleland, or Reddit,

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.970
or wherever we
visited yesterday--

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:49.480
Facebook and tweet-- everybody's
dressing very casually.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.680
Very casually.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:55.270
I am a much more
formal person, and I

00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:59.040
feel comfortable
wearing a jacket,

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:03.080
because I don't want anybody
to see all my bulges.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:07.700
If I had a gorgeous body, maybe
I would not wear the jacket.

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:13.590
But what I am really concerned
about is for schools.

00:32:13.590 --> 00:32:19.000
Children from age six to 18--
and even little 11-year-old

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.490
girls-- want to look
sexy, because, of course,

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:26.210
they learn from the movie
stars, and from the movies,

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.890
and the media that
that is a way to look.

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:34.400
And they flaunt their little
bodies with low cut blouses.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:37.480
And they flaunt what they
have, or they wish they had.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.450
I don't know.

00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:39.670
So I don't like that.

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:42.010
I think that students
in school should

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:44.970
look like students in
school, and concentrate

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:46.250
on improving their minds.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:50.740
They have enough time
to look sexy and sloppy.

00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.150
I will tell you one thing.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:56.620
When I dress up-- we
used to be younger,

00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.340
went swimming in
a bathing suit--

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:03.840
I acted a little bit less
formal than I act in my suit.

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:10.270
So the way we dress does have
an effect on the way we behave.

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:11.860
That's my opinion.

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.590
So I see when I
talk to teachers--

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:18.580
and see some of the little girls
with shorts that their tush is

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:21.280
sticking out from
it-- I said, is that

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.720
appropriate for your dress code?

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.260
They said, not exactly,
but it's too much work

00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:28.890
to check it all
out and control it.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.225
I don't like guys
with pony tails,

00:33:33.225 --> 00:33:35.750
and I'm sure there
are many here.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:39.680
Body piercings, tattoos,
and any of that.

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.800
I don't know why
it's so important

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:44.920
to make holes in your body when
you don't really need them.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:45.530
I don't know.

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:46.780
Anyway.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:50.260
Obviously I have none,
even the traditional holes

00:33:50.260 --> 00:33:53.130
that women have, I don't have.

00:33:53.130 --> 00:33:55.410
I don't like-- and tattoos.

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:58.660
I didn't know that that much ink
in the body make you healthier,

00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:59.925
I don't know.

00:33:59.925 --> 00:34:03.410
But that is what the style
and the tradition is now--

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:06.980
or the people use it a lot.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:12.179
So about 16 years
ago, I was invited

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:14.590
to lecture at a
local high school.

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:16.100
And I'm heading
to the auditorium,

00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:20.159
and in front of me are
three young 16-year-old boys

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:21.360
with baggy pants.

00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:26.110
Now there is a style of
clothing that makes no sense.

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:29.630
If they had to run for their
lives, do you think they could?

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:32.630
They would have to pull
those pants up, or take them

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:34.650
up-- one of the two.

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:37.560
So they were walking
in front of me.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.159
The crotch was the
height of the knee.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:43.920
They were holding the
pants up with a hand,

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.870
and the bottoms were
cleaning the hallway,

00:34:46.870 --> 00:34:50.120
as I was walking behind them.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:54.044
When one of them accidentally
dropped the book, and then

00:34:54.044 --> 00:34:58.286
he has the audacity to
bend down and pick it up.

00:34:58.286 --> 00:35:03.200
I can tell you I saw places
where the sun never shined.

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.670
I was so embarrassed
I had to turn away.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:12.230
Then I got mad,
because this school

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:16.570
was in my tax district-- was
supported by my tax money.

00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:19.420
So I went up to the teacher
who invited me, and told him

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:20.035
what happened.

00:35:20.035 --> 00:35:25.320
And I said to him, these
three boys look like bums.

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:28.500
Because people with baggy
pants don't look very sharp,

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.090
in my opinion.

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:33.370
And why would anybody
want to look like a bum?

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:38.690
They probably are on
drugs, or drug addicts.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:42.790
And he told me immediately
that these three young boys

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:46.720
are very good students, and
they have never used any drugs.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:47.530
I was shocked.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:55.690
But I realized that even
I have to take the time,

00:35:55.690 --> 00:35:58.730
and get to know the
person, and judge

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:00.450
each person on their merits.

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:04.900
So in the last 16 years,
I haven't changed my mind

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.200
about liking these
styles of clothing,

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:12.140
but I have made an effort
not to jump to any conclusion

00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:15.700
without getting to
know the person.

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:18.640
Life lesson number three.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.100
I forgave the Nazis.

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:22.470
I forgave everybody.

00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:26.850
And if anybody would have
asked me 22 years ago today,

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:29.680
if I forgave the Nazis,
I would've told you,

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.950
please find a really
good psychiatrist.

00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:37.290
I had no intention
of forgiving anybody.

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:42.090
I was angry with the world,
and I hated everybody.

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:46.516
And I can tell you people
have difficulty today

00:36:46.516 --> 00:36:49.640
to really believe that.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:55.400
But I have written a
poem in 1985-- 10 years

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:59.860
before I forgave the Nazis--
and when you see that poem,

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:03.360
it's a child's ABC
from Auschwitz.

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.530
A is for Auschwitz, a
place close to hell.

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:09.990
B is for Birkenau, where
brave children were.

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:13.780
C is for children,
standing [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:17.010
D is for dead people,
bodies everywhere.

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:20.190
E is for experiments--
you get-- it's

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:23.110
a poor me, the poor victim,
all those things that

00:37:23.110 --> 00:37:24.200
were done to me.

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:28.610
There was nothing
that I could do.

00:37:28.610 --> 00:37:30.520
So when people read
that poem, they

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:33.550
realize that I have
come a long way.

00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:37.090
And nothing really happened
to me until my sister died,

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:43.750
and I was asked to a few-- more
than a month after her death,

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:47.570
unrelated to her death, I
received a telephone call

00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:49.870
from a professor at
Boston College who

00:37:49.870 --> 00:37:57.800
said to me, Eva Kor, I have
heard your presentation

00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.550
at Boston School of Medicine.

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:03.080
I am doing one of
those conferences,

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.920
and I would like you
to come to Boston,

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:09.000
and lecture to some doctors.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.120
And he said, by the way,
when you come to Boston,

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.700
it would be really
nice if you could

00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:16.730
bring with you a Nazi doctor.

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:19.170
Stunned at the
request, I immediately

00:38:19.170 --> 00:38:22.890
blurted out, where
on earth do you think

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:25.970
I can find one of those guys?

00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:29.060
They are not advertising
in the Yellow Pages.

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:31.460
They are not advertising
in Google either.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.940
So he told me, think about it.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:38.850
Maybe you'll come up with
some kind of an idea.

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:39.650
And I did.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.930
I remembered that
the last project

00:38:41.930 --> 00:38:45.740
that Miriam and I worked
on was a documentary

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:50.000
on the Mengele twins done by
German television, finished

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.070
in March of 1992.

00:38:52.070 --> 00:38:57.500
And there was a Nazi doctor from
Auschwitz in that documentary,

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:01.680
who was not my doctor, but
he was a friend of Mengele's.

00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:06.510
So I immediately contacted
in Frankfurt, Germany,

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:09.930
the television network,
ZDF, and told them

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:14.530
Miriam died, would they please
give me Dr. Munch's telephone

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:18.015
number in the memory of
Miriam, and they did.

00:39:18.015 --> 00:39:21.460
We contacted Dr. Munch,
invited him to Boston.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:24.060
He said, no, I'm not
coming to Boston,

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:27.600
but I'm willing to meet
with you, Eva, at my house.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:31.240
So August of 1993, I
am heading to Germany

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.880
to meet a Nazi doctor.

00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.580
I was so scared.

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:38.740
What I remembered
about Nazi doctors,

00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.690
I did not want to
experience again.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:44.290
But I was curious,
maybe he knew something

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:46.330
about our experiments.

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:49.640
And I was curious, why
was this Nazi doctor

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.280
willing to meet with me?

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.540
I arrived at his house.

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:56.280
He treated me with the
utmost respect, kindness,

00:39:56.280 --> 00:40:00.000
consideration, telling me
he didn't know anything

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.430
about our experiments
because Mengele always

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:07.280
said the twins experiments
are top secret.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:11.860
He gave me a good interview
for my Boston conference.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.600
Then out of the blue-- I never
planned to ask him anything--

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:19.370
I heard myself say, Dr.
Munch, by any chance,

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:23.110
do you know anything about
the operation of the gas

00:40:23.110 --> 00:40:25.640
chambers in Auschwitz?

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:30.150
And he immediately blurted
out, this is my problem.

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:33.810
This is the nightmare that
I live with every single day

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:34.530
of my life.

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:40.470
And he went on describing the
operation of the gas chamber.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:42.110
People would be
told that they're

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:46.290
going to take a shower
after the long journey.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:48.820
The shower rooms were
cleaned, polished,

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:52.420
and they would even spread
perfume in the rooms.

00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:56.210
Once the shower room
was packed with people,

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:58.220
the doors would
close hermetically.

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:02.760
Dr. Munch was stationed outside
looking through a peephole.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:09.900
And he said that the gas did
not come from the shower heads.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:17.100
They came-- Zyklon B looks
like pallets of white gravel.

00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:19.640
They were packed in canisters.

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:23.020
The canisters were
opened outside the roof,

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:26.680
and dropped through vent-like
openings in the roof.

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:31.500
So they came from the
roof, fell to the floor,

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.480
operated like dry ice.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:38.110
So the gas was actually
rising from the floor.

00:41:38.110 --> 00:41:41.370
And as people were
suffocating, often

00:41:41.370 --> 00:41:45.850
taking their last
breath of air, they

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:48.790
would try to climb
on other people

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:54.120
to get away from the rising
gas, forming a little mountain

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:57.250
of intermingled bodies.

00:41:57.250 --> 00:42:00.660
Dr. Munch knew that
the strongest people

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.850
were on the top of the pile.

00:42:02.850 --> 00:42:05.470
And when the strongest
people stopped moving,

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:08.930
he knew that everybody
was dead, and he would

00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:12.050
sign one death certificate.

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:15.240
Of course, no names,
just the number of people

00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.610
that were murdered.

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:19.170
I told him immediately
that this was

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:23.020
very important
information-- I have never

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:26.660
heard about it before, never
read it in any book, never seen

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:29.080
it in any documentary--
and that I

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:32.340
was going to Auschwitz in 1995.

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:36.330
I wanted him to go with
me, and sign a document

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:38.540
at the ruins of
the gas chambers,

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:42.310
in the company of
witnesses, so years later,

00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:45.310
people could not say
that he didn't sign it.

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:49.540
And he immediately told
me that he would love to.

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.730
I did not know it was
going to be that easy.

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:55.890
But I got back to
Terre Haute, Indiana,

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:59.650
and I was very excited
that I will have,

00:42:59.650 --> 00:43:02.730
actually, a Nazi
who witnessed it,

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:06.740
testify to the operation
of the gas chamber.

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:09.710
I wanted to thank him.

00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:12.340
I didn't know how to
thank a Nazi doctor.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.300
I didn't even know
where does one look

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:17.910
for a gift for a Nazi doctor.

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:20.590
So I went to the
local Hallmark shop,

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:23.655
and went to the section
of thank you cards,

00:43:23.655 --> 00:43:28.350
and I started reading card after
card for two and a half hours.

00:43:28.350 --> 00:43:30.860
And I was very serious.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:32.787
Two ladies came up
to me, telling me,

00:43:32.787 --> 00:43:36.270
you know, you've been reading
those cards for a long time.

00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:37.520
I said, yes.

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.790
Are you finding what
you're looking for?

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:41.610
Not really.

00:43:41.610 --> 00:43:43.170
Well, what are you looking for?

00:43:43.170 --> 00:43:45.506
Tell us, maybe we can help you.

00:43:45.506 --> 00:43:46.720
Said, no, thank you.

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:49.310
I left the card shop,
but, of course, I

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:52.490
couldn't give up my idea.

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:55.570
And I went back to my own
life lesson number one.

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:59.150
For the next 10 months, while
I was cooking, cleaning,

00:43:59.150 --> 00:44:02.810
doing the laundry, or driving
the car for my real estate

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:05.260
functions, when
my mind wasn't too

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:09.650
busy, I kept asking
myself and brainstorming,

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:11.630
what can I give
this Nazi doctor?

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:13.630
How can I thank him?

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:16.110
Lots of ideas
popped into my head.

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:19.610
None of them seemed appropriate
until 10 months later,

00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:23.670
with a simple idea-- how about
a letter of forgiveness from me

00:44:23.670 --> 00:44:24.990
to Dr. Munch.

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:29.270
I immediately knew that this
was a meaningful gift for Dr.

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:34.580
Munch, but what I discovered
for myself was life changing.

00:44:34.580 --> 00:44:38.250
I discovered that I had
the power to forgive.

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:40.530
No one could give me that power.

00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:41.725
No one could take it away.

00:44:41.725 --> 00:44:46.220
It was all mine to use
it in any way I wished.

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:47.640
So I began writing my letter.

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:50.790
It took me another four
months, and finally I

00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:52.600
liked what I wrote.

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.640
But then it occurred
to me that somebody

00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:57.720
might to read my letter,
and my spelling in English

00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:02.400
is terrible, so I contacted
my former English professor

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.280
to correct my spelling.

00:45:04.280 --> 00:45:06.350
And she got very enthusiastic.

00:45:06.350 --> 00:45:08.580
We met three times.

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:11.590
And the third time we
met, she said, well,

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:15.110
Eva, that's nice that
you forgive Dr. Munch,

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:19.020
but your problem is with
Dr. Mengele, not with Munch.

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:20.120
I tried to debate that.

00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:23.150
She said, just do me a favor.

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:26.480
She said, when you
go home tonight,

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:29.740
pretend that you are
talking to Mengele,

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:31.990
and telling him that
you forgive him,

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:35.805
because what I want you to
find out for yourself, how

00:45:35.805 --> 00:45:40.500
does it make you feel
to be able to do that?

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:43.370
It sounded like a good idea.

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:45.510
And that day I went home.

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:46.800
I closed the bedroom door.

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:50.430
I looked up as many nasty
words in the dictionary--

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:52.940
now I would use
Google, they didn't

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:58.930
have Google then-- as I could
find, and wrote them down.

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:02.780
I read them out clear and loud.

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:07.440
And then at the end I
said, in spite of all that,

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:09.320
I forgive you.

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:11.850
That felt very interesting.

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:15.620
That I, the little guinea
pig from Auschwitz,

00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.430
had the power even over Mengele.

00:46:18.430 --> 00:46:22.750
And my relationship
with Mengele would end

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:24.900
with my letter of forgiveness.

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:29.080
There was nothing that
he could do to change it.

00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:33.200
I wasn't hurting anybody,
so why couldn't I do it?

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.410
And if I forgave Mengele--
the worst of them--

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:40.940
I decided to forgive everybody
who has ever hurt me.

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.920
And that is the way we
arrived at Auschwitz.

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:46.410
Dr. Munch came with his family.

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:47.820
I took my family.

00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:50.840
Dr. Munch signed his document.

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:54.780
I read mine, and signed
it, and gave the copies

00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:57.220
that I had there to Dr. Munch.

00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:00.465
I immediately felt
that all the pain

00:47:00.465 --> 00:47:05.980
I carried around for 50 years
was lifted from my shoulder.

00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:08.650
I was no longer a
victim of Auschwitz,

00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:11.900
nor was I a prisoner
of my tragic past.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:16.200
I was free of Auschwitz,
and free of Mengele.

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:21.340
I believe, from my
understanding and research,

00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:24.660
that anger is a seed for war.

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:31.800
Happy children do not grow
up to be mass murderers,

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:36.460
but angry children might
like to have revenge.

00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:40.190
And Hitler himself
was a very angry man,

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:43.570
and felt like a victim.

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:50.170
And so he-- I call therefore
anger-- is a seed for war.

00:47:50.170 --> 00:47:52.460
On the other hand,
people who forgive

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.270
are at peace with
themselves and the world.

00:47:55.270 --> 00:48:00.630
So I call forgiveness
a seed for peace.

00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:06.480
If any of you in this wonderful
group of Google people

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:10.230
is angry, all you will really
need is a piece of paper

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:14.175
and a pen, and start writing
a letter to the person,

00:48:14.175 --> 00:48:17.650
or persons, who hurt you.

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:23.430
At the end, you must write
the words, "I forgive you,"

00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:25.970
and you must mean them.

00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:28.410
And if it not going
to make you, I

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:32.390
believe you will feel
liberated, elated.

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:36.180
I would describe the
experience like Maria

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:40.160
in "The Sound of Music,"
being at the top of the hill,

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:45.080
and fresh air breezing
all around her.

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:47.860
And if it works for
you, I hope you pass it

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:54.900
on to other people who need
it, because I need everybody

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:59.130
to help me sow those
seeds for peace.

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:00.725
Congratulations.

00:49:00.725 --> 00:49:03.250
You survived my lecture.

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:08.510
I'm ready for your questions,
and answers, and pictures,

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:11.650
and then you can
Google everybody,

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:13.480
everything you want to.

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:15.099
Thank you very much.

00:49:15.099 --> 00:49:22.699
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:22.699 --> 00:49:23.240
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.880
Thank you for your lecture.

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:29.860
You mentioned having been
raised in an Orthodox household.

00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:33.220
Did you maintain a religious
identity and religious practice

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:34.100
through adulthood?

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:35.420
EVA KOR: I am Jewish.

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:40.940
I paid too much price for it
to become any other religion.

00:49:40.940 --> 00:49:45.530
I am not a very
religious person today.

00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:51.240
And the reason that is-- I know
some people have challenged me,

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:53.510
how can you not be religious?

00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:56.680
And I will tell you an
interesting observation

00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:59.030
that you-- none of
you-- even if you

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:04.100
plan it-- will know
how you will cope

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:06.800
when your life is on the line.

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.430
I arrived in Auschwitz.

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:11.840
The first night, I
didn't eat the bread,

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:16.350
because it was not
kosher, even though we

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:19.250
were in the cattle car for
four days without any food.

00:50:21.820 --> 00:50:30.330
When I saw the dead children
in the latrine, at age 10,

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:33.870
I could not figure
out what to do.

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:36.170
I decided that I
was going to live.

00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:41.550
And for that it meant that I had
to do-- eat everything-- and do

00:50:41.550 --> 00:50:44.740
everything to survive.

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:49.180
That is the way I coped
with life and death.

00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:52.610
So I discarded that
little religious girl,

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:55.720
and instead of being a
little religious Jewish girl,

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.740
I became a survivor.

00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:01.370
I never went back
to the religion,

00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:07.350
but that doesn't mean that every
person coped the way I coped.

00:51:07.350 --> 00:51:10.790
I have met twins
who survived, who

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:13.930
said they survived
because they were praying.

00:51:13.930 --> 00:51:16.590
That was not what
happened to me.

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:18.800
And if anybody
thinks, among you,

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:23.930
that you know how
you will cope when

00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:27.280
you're facing life and
death, I'm telling you,

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:29.400
you're very naive.

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:31.940
AUDIENCE: So when you
were in Auschwitz,

00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:34.540
like you said before,
death was all around you--

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:38.650
what was so different
about your experience?

00:51:38.650 --> 00:51:41.700
Do you think it really was
your strong desire to live?

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:42.950
Was there sort of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:50.530
EVA KOR: How come
that I didn't give up?

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:55.060
That has to do with
my early childhood.

00:51:55.060 --> 00:52:00.330
We had two older sisters,
and my mother was expecting,

00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:03.200
and my father
desperately wanted a boy.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:06.490
So when he died,
well, he was worried

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:09.890
about somebody saying the
prayer of the dead-- Kaddish--

00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:11.600
for him.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:16.590
Well, the midwife told my father
that there was a little girl,

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:19.730
but he said, don't despair,
another one is coming.

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:23.290
Of course, his hope was that
this was going to be a boy.

00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:28.480
So I arrived as the greatest
disappointment to my father.

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:31.980
And when I was five
and a half years old,

00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:33.780
one day he said to me, "Eva."

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:34.920
I said, "Yes, Daddy."

00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:38.180
He said, "You
should've been a boy."

00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:41.270
I knew nothing
about reproduction.

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:45.820
I thought the storks
brought the babies.

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:49.170
I said that I don't
think it's my fault,

00:52:49.170 --> 00:52:50.790
and he got very mad at me.

00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:55.230
So from that time on, I
was set up to failure just

00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:56.440
about every day.

00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:00.450
And I remember he would find
some excuse to punish me.

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:03.320
And I remember
talking to Miriam,

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:06.720
comparing notes about
daddy after the war,

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:09.790
and Miriam said daddy
was a wonderful guy.

00:53:09.790 --> 00:53:13.540
He would put me on his lap and
tell me stories about his visit

00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:14.990
to Palestine.

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:19.670
I said, Miriam, did we
have the same father?

00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:23.490
I saw his lap when he pulled
out his belt to belt me.

00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:27.090
These were our two
different experiences.

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:33.610
I learned in those four and a
half years to defy my father,

00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:36.010
and outsmart him.

00:53:36.010 --> 00:53:39.540
So when I arrived in
Auschwitz, I already

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:43.300
had four and a half
years of experience

00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:45.180
of outsmarting authority.

00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:47.170
Of course, authority
in Auschwitz

00:53:47.170 --> 00:53:50.750
was bigger and more dangerous,
but I was not as scared.

00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:54.830
Miriam always looked at me,
what I was doing-- like I really

00:53:54.830 --> 00:54:01.820
knew what I was doing--
but I did not let fear rule

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:03.280
and ruin my life.

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:09.430
And that is the way I became
so different from the others.

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:10.340
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:13.585
And my second
question is, when you

00:54:13.585 --> 00:54:17.420
were talking about your process
for forgiving the doctors,

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:20.600
and how you would write a letter
to them and then at the end

00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:22.220
write "I forgive you."

00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:25.990
And you said the key is
that you have to mean it.

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:30.840
So there are people that I would
like to forgive in my life--

00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:32.912
EVA KOR: Do not mail it to them.

00:54:32.912 --> 00:54:33.972
AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:54:33.972 --> 00:54:34.680
I'm not going to.

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:38.630
EVA KOR: Because I had a bad
experience with a friend who

00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:42.440
wrote a guy who molested her.

00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:45.265
And then he wrote
back to her, and said,

00:54:45.265 --> 00:54:47.490
well, I have to forgive
you too, because I

00:54:47.490 --> 00:54:49.980
spent five years in jail.

00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:52.850
And that's a toxic relationship.

00:54:52.850 --> 00:54:55.790
And I don't think
that you can really

00:54:55.790 --> 00:55:01.640
repair it, because they live
with their own venomous life.

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:02.970
I don't know.

00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:10.250
However, I think that if you can
forgive-- truly forgive, like I

00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:13.320
have forgiven the
Nazis-- you open up

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:17.240
a lot of other experiences
to enter in your life

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:22.790
instead of cluttering your
life with pain and anger.

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:24.790
And that is the
reason that I feel

00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:27.570
it's so important for
people to forgive.

00:55:27.570 --> 00:55:33.500
I also talked yesterday
and other times to lawyers.

00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:38.910
And the judicial system
talks about justice.

00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:41.920
Well, what on earth is justice?

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:45.780
When I asked very
well educated people,

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.820
they have difficulties
in defining it.

00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:54.150
And I don't think that
justice really exists,

00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:58.490
but the judicial system is
trying to accomplish that.

00:55:58.490 --> 00:56:02.530
At the same time,
if every Nazi would

00:56:02.530 --> 00:56:07.730
have been hanged after
World War II, I, the victim,

00:56:07.730 --> 00:56:10.970
would have still been an
11-year-old orphan who

00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:15.860
was used in experiments and
survived unbelievable things.

00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:19.360
So how on earth
would it help me?

00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:24.980
If the judicial system
would pay as much attention

00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:29.070
in healing the
victims as they pay

00:56:29.070 --> 00:56:34.130
in punishing the perpetrators,
the judicial system

00:56:34.130 --> 00:56:35.390
would work very well.

00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:43.130
Because, in my humble
opinion, every unhealed victim

00:56:43.130 --> 00:56:45.680
is a potential perpetrator.

00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:49.430
Look at the prisons
are filled with people

00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:51.900
who were not born
to be criminals,

00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:54.900
but something happened
in their lives,

00:56:54.900 --> 00:57:00.050
and they are lashing out at
society and whoever they can.

00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:02.690
AUDIENCE: I want to thank
you so much for speaking

00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:07.870
to us about your experiences,
and what you've learned.

00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:11.560
I'm wondering if you could tell
the story of how you started

00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:14.030
to speak to groups
like this, and how

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:16.790
that has evolved over time.

00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:20.780
EVA KOR: That is a
very interesting thing.

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:24.120
First of all, I
used to be scared.

00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:28.530
I was a member of a Jewish
woman's organization,

00:57:28.530 --> 00:57:32.780
and they made me vice
president of one branch.

00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:35.480
And I remember getting
ready for those reports,

00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:40.630
my stomach was in knots and
I could hardly hear my voice.

00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:43.400
But after two,
three years of that,

00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:46.490
I became president
of that organization.

00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:48.860
And I voiced my opinion clearly.

00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:57.300
Now I did not speak about
my experiences until 1978.

00:57:57.300 --> 00:57:59.880
I never made a secret out of it.

00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:02.180
I never covered my
number, and if people

00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:07.530
asked about where did the number
come from, I would tell them.

00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:10.730
And I have a cute
little story about that.

00:58:10.730 --> 00:58:14.670
So you would understand
how children's minds work.

00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:17.660
My daughter, whose name is--
oh, I cannot give out her name.

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.450
She doesn't like to be famous.

00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:22.770
She lives in San Francisco.

00:58:22.770 --> 00:58:27.340
But she was three years old and
she had a little friend, Jill.

00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:32.080
And she went for a slumber
party with her friend Jill.

00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:38.330
And Mrs. Baker-- Jill's
mother-- fixed breakfast,

00:58:38.330 --> 00:58:42.060
my daughter said, Mrs.
Baker, where is your number?

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.370
She said, what number?

00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:48.930
She said, well, my
mommy has a number.

00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:52.730
I thought all
mommies had numbers.

00:58:52.730 --> 00:58:56.360
So that is the way children
understand the world.

00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:58.490
So Mrs. Baker said
to my daughter,

00:58:58.490 --> 00:59:00.550
no, not all mothers
have numbers.

00:59:00.550 --> 00:59:02.410
So why does my
mommy have a number?

00:59:02.410 --> 00:59:04.560
She says, you better
go home and ask her.

00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:06.760
So she came home
skipping and hopping.

00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:10.690
She said, mommy, you know Mrs.
Baker doesn't have a number.

00:59:10.690 --> 00:59:12.490
I said, I know that.

00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:13.580
Well, how come you do?

00:59:13.580 --> 00:59:17.030
I said, well, you know those
bad guys-- Nazis-- killed

00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:18.160
your grandparents?

00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:20.600
They also put a
number on my arm.

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:22.200
Oh.

00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:25.266
And she wanted a simple
answer, I gave her the answer,

00:59:25.266 --> 00:59:27.160
and she was happy with it.

00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:29.820
But children always
feel whatever

00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:32.420
happens to them, that
is the way the world is.

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:35.180
So I didn't lecture.

00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:43.410
The Holocaust show was shown
in the United States in 1978.

00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:48.414
I was contacted by Jewish
organizations in New York

00:59:48.414 --> 00:59:52.430
to make sure that our
local affiliate would

00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:57.020
carry the docudrama.

00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:00.600
I didn't know what
a docudrama was.

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:04.130
And so I contacted
the local NBC station,

01:00:04.130 --> 01:00:09.080
and I told them that I was
wondering, in that docudrama,

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.130
if they had documentary footage.

01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:13.950
And they asked me why.

01:00:13.950 --> 01:00:18.090
I said, because I want to
know if I can recognize it.

01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:19.150
What do you mean?

01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:20.070
You were there?

01:00:20.070 --> 01:00:23.940
I said, well, want do
you think this accent is?

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:25.860
And I said, yes.

01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:32.830
They said, no, it's based on
the actual documentary footage,

01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:35.660
but it's not
documentary footage.

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:37.920
It will look similar.

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.420
So because they realized
that I was a survivor,

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:46.000
they asked me to appear
on the nightly news

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.060
the first night
that the show aired.

01:00:49.060 --> 01:00:52.220
And they got such
a strong response,

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:55.850
they wanted me back
the last night.

01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:59.550
And local junior high
school students--

01:00:59.550 --> 01:01:03.530
first was a junior high
school student-- contacted me,

01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:07.960
and said, would I be willing
to lecture at the school.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:08.650
I said, sure.

01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:11.030
I didn't know exactly
what I was going to say,

01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:13.600
and I think I talked
for three hours.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.840
The school was shut down.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:20.630
And then other schools asked
me, and civic groups asked me,

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:24.390
and after maybe
10 or 15 lectures,

01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:29.660
I realized that everybody was
interested in how I survived.

01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:33.830
So then I decided to write
down, because the mind that

01:01:33.830 --> 01:01:35.630
has an interesting thing.

01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:38.260
You start talking
about a topic, and it's

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:40.370
like branches of a tree.

01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:44.670
Grow-- other memories
keep running into it.

01:01:44.670 --> 01:01:48.290
So you have to focus on
what I needed to say.

01:01:48.290 --> 01:01:50.500
And so I designed my lecture.

01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.280
I wrote it out.

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:57.200
And I write it out, how
I survived Auschwitz.

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.950
And I started to add
lessons much, much later.

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:03.200
But an interesting thing.

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:08.430
I was always very cool,
calm, and collected.

01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:12.110
I never had any emotion,
and I was very proud of it.

01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:19.250
But from 1978 until 1985,
I finished every lecture

01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:21.670
with a very strange statement.

01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:24.410
I said, I know it
happened to me,

01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:26.890
but I always feel
like I'm looking down

01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:29.940
at that little girl,
and telling her story.

01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:32.680
And nobody said, that's
a strange statement.

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.530
Why are you saying it?

01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:38.000
They think that survivors
are very fragile.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.430
I am not.

01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:46.230
Anyway, in 1985, I was lecturing
at a local university-- Indiana

01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:52.870
State University-- and it
was September of 1985--

01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:57.870
and I described the
separation from my mother,

01:02:57.870 --> 01:03:00.630
and I began sobbing
uncontrollably.

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:04.170
I did not have a
hanky in my pocket,

01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:05.795
because I never needed one.

01:03:05.795 --> 01:03:09.050
I'm sure I have one now.

01:03:09.050 --> 01:03:15.310
And I was wiping my nose, it was
embarrassing, it was terrible.

01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:20.420
And every lecture after
that, similar experiences

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:24.680
I had until maybe
50 lectures later,

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:30.940
I realized that something
changed in my relationship

01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:33.050
to my story.

01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:36.560
And I realized that
never again did

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:41.820
I say, at the end of my lecture,
that I'm standing up here

01:03:41.820 --> 01:03:46.210
looking down at that little
girl, and telling her story.

01:03:46.210 --> 01:03:49.900
Because that little
girl and me became one.

01:03:49.900 --> 01:03:52.380
And I could feel
all of the horrors

01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:55.930
that I have experienced
in the camp.

01:03:55.930 --> 01:03:59.250
My lectures have
evolved tremendously.

01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:02.950
And some people have heard
my lectures 25 years ago,

01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:06.750
because I've been
lecturing now 37 years.

01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:10.320
And they say they liked it
then, but they like it more now.

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:12.410
So I don't know.

01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:17.240
And I don't have any
recorded lectures

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:21.020
from those early times.

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:23.500
AUDIENCE: As time goes
by, just unfortunately,

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.860
we will have fewer
opportunities to hear

01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:29.560
from people, such as yourself,
who experienced all of this

01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:30.870
firsthand.

01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:34.200
And documentaries, and letters,
and so on are helpful--

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.170
or recordings of
lectures are helpful--

01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:39.300
but there's something
to be said for hearing

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:40.555
from someone themselves.

01:04:40.555 --> 01:04:43.030
EVA KOR: Well, I decided I
was going to live forever.

01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:45.970
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:45.970 --> 01:04:48.090
AUDIENCE: But my
question is what

01:04:48.090 --> 01:04:50.610
is the best way in
which we can allow

01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:54.770
these stories and these lives
to live on 50 years from now,

01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:56.640
100 years from now?

01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:00.760
EVA KOR: Well, I have
visited the Shoah Foundation

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:08.370
in Southern California
University with Stephen Smith,

01:05:08.370 --> 01:05:16.380
and they are willing to
produce a hologram of my life.

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:19.300
We are trying to raise the
money for it, because it's not

01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:22.160
any kind of money that I have.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:26.810
And I have interacted
with the hologram

01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:29.840
they have created of Pinchas.

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:32.620
So I don't know if that
is going to be the answer

01:05:32.620 --> 01:05:36.020
to your particular question.

01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:40.822
Would you like to say
anything, Kiel, regarding that?

01:05:40.822 --> 01:05:42.030
KIEL MAJEWSKI: Hey, everyone.

01:05:42.030 --> 01:05:42.830
My name's Kiel.

01:05:42.830 --> 01:05:45.800
So I'm the director
of Eva's museum.

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.550
But basically I'm
just a guy-- I'm

01:05:47.550 --> 01:05:51.040
not Jewish-- I'm just a regular
guy who thought this lady's

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:54.880
story is powerful, and needs to
be preserved and shared widely,

01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:56.550
both now and in the future.

01:05:56.550 --> 01:05:58.180
And I want to take
your question,

01:05:58.180 --> 01:05:59.720
and turn it back on you guys.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:02.540
Because this is Google,
and if something

01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:05.460
can be done that's crazy
and futuristic anywhere

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:08.650
in the world, it's right
here on this campus.

01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:12.030
So maybe people don't have
answers or ideas right now,

01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:13.730
but let that germinate.

01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:16.400
How can we take
this lady's story

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:19.430
and elevate her
platform both now

01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:22.970
and for generations to come?

01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:24.620
EVA KOR: Boy, that's
a big assignment.

01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:26.700
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:28.490
You thought I was tough.

01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:29.850
Look at that.

01:06:29.850 --> 01:06:31.350
AUDIENCE: I've
wanted to know-- I've

01:06:31.350 --> 01:06:33.910
read in accounts
from other survivors

01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:38.080
that Mengele, at times,
gave treats to the children,

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.770
or treating them
almost as described

01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:41.430
as like a kindly father.

01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:45.170
I want to know is that really
true in your experience?

01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:48.270
EVA KOR: I have heard from
twins who have received candy

01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:50.290
from Mengele.

01:06:50.290 --> 01:06:53.960
You have to understand the
relationship between us

01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:57.400
and Mengele was one of
the most complicated

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.420
human relationships.

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:03.960
We knew, within the first
month, that he probably

01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:07.420
was responsible for the
deaths of our families.

01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:12.870
Yet he was willing to do-- as
long as he wanted us alive--

01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:16.550
he was willing to do
anything to keep us alive.

01:07:16.550 --> 01:07:19.900
And in the eyes of
many of the children,

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:24.510
he replaced the father
that they no longer had.

01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:30.740
And so therefore, I
was a very angry child

01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:32.780
when I arrived in Auschwitz.

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:37.520
And I am sure that my instincts,
and my vibrations, Mengele

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:41.050
got that I didn't want to
have anything to do with him.

01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:43.910
So he never gave me any
candy, nor I don't think

01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:45.660
that I would have taken it.

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:47.390
I don't know.

01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:48.950
Because we were
starving to death.

01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:51.770
But I definitely
was not one of those

01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:58.480
that Mengele would treat like
his sweet little children.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.200
I was angry.

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:02.700
And I don't really
know how people--

01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:06.360
but I know that if
I enter into a room,

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:09.770
I can sense it if this
is a friendly group

01:08:09.770 --> 01:08:12.380
or a dangerous group, and
I head out even though

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:14.510
without knowing anything.

01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:18.390
So I am sure that
being ever close to me,

01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:20.710
he did not get any
good vibrations.

01:08:20.710 --> 01:08:24.052
And I was a tough cookie.

01:08:24.052 --> 01:08:24.979
Yep.

01:08:24.979 --> 01:08:29.412
But I heard about it, and I
believe it definitely happened.

01:08:29.412 --> 01:08:31.870
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much
for the little team, who kind

01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:32.994
of brought us all out here.

01:08:32.994 --> 01:08:36.210
It has been an honor for me to
spend an hour in your presence,

01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:39.770
and I think I probably speak
on behalf of everyone here.

01:08:39.770 --> 01:08:41.230
So thank you.

01:08:41.230 --> 01:08:43.330
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:43.330 --> 01:08:45.480
EVA KOR: Thank you very much.
