00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.570
These days, you’d be a fool to leave a movie
theatre as soon as the credits started to

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.619
roll, because you’re more than likely to
end up missing out on something important

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:14.700
or fun if you do.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.650
The days when credits were nothing more than
a list of the names of the people involved

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:19.700
in the making a movie are long gone.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.419
Now, audiences are treated to mid-credits
scenes and post-credits scenes, as well as

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.930
interesting messages and funny jokes that
are hidden within the credits themselves.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.489
Of course, the key word there is “hidden”.

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.649
Often, it’s hard to spot these fun inclusions
with the naked eye – the mass of text included

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.130
in any given movie’s credits can make it
almost impossible to see them – but they’re

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.750
definitely there and we’re going to show
you a selection of the funniest.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.600
Here are 10 hilarious jokes hidden in the
credits of popular movies (in chronological

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.600
order).

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.059
Frozen
In Disney’s insanely popular 2013 animated

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.274
movie Frozen, Kristoff – an iceman and one
of the movie’s main characters – unashamedly

00:00:50.274 --> 00:00:54.010
claims that all men pick their nose and eat
the contents, grossing Anna out in the process.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.190
Rather hilariously, Disney opted to avoid
any booger-related lawsuits by placing the

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.920
following message in the movie’s credits:
"The views and opinions expressed by Kristoff

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.790
in the film that all men eat their own boogers
are solely his own and do not necessarily

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.409
reflect the views and opinions of The Walt
Disney Company or the filmmakers."

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.920
Carry On Abroad
The Carry On movies are some of the most iconic

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.270
in British comedy history.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.790
Focusing on the very British comic tradition
of the music hall and indecent seaside postcards,

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.030
they tickled audiences over the course of
no less than five decades.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.049
1972’s Carry On Abroad – a movie about
vacationing in the sunny Mediterranean - is

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.060
proof that jokes have actually been appearing
in movie credits for a very long time, as

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:41.810
the movie’s “Technical Director” is
listed as being “Sun Tan Lo Tion”.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.560
Airplane II: The Sequel
The Airplane movies are some of the funniest

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.299
spoof movies ever produced and the people
behind them ensured that the laughs continued

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.020
after the credits started to roll.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.870
1982’s Airplane II: The Sequel poked fun
at the job titles of some of the people who

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.000
worked on the movie in a very humorous way.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.401
Every movie has a “Best Boy”, but Airplane
II listed the movie’s “Worst Boy” as

00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:01.401
being “Adolf Hitler”.

00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:04.789
And the job title of “Gaffer” was followed
by the question “What’s a Gaffer??”

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:11.090
which, come to think of it, is actually a
genuinely intriguing question!

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.190
RoboCop
Although it did include a lot of satirical

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.110
material, 1987’s RoboCop could hardly be
described as a comedy.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.150
However, there was certainly a funny little
inclusion within the movie’s credits.

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.209
In place of the usual piracy warning, there
was a terrifying but undoubtedly very humorous

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.239
threat to any people who might be considering
unlawfully copying, selling or showing the

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.239
movie.

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.330
The warning made reference to the robotic
creations in the movie itself and read “This

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.840
motion picture is protected under the laws
of the United States and other countries and

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.319
its unauthorized duplication, distribution
or exhibition may result in civil liability

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:48.980
and criminal prosecution by enforcement droids.”

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.569
Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult
Like the aforementioned Airplane movies before

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.590
them, the Naked Gun series of movies are some
of the greatest spoof comedies ever produced.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.290
All of the Naked Gun offerings provided laughs
in the credits, but none more so than 1994’s

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.670
Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.420
There’s no way we could cover them all,
but some examples included a message telling

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.909
the owner of a Honda Accord to report to the
parking lot because they’d left their lights

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.189
on, a list of people who were cut from the
movie in spite of the fact that it wasn’t

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:22.260
their fault, and a very demanding message
telling the audience “DON’T LEAVE YET!”

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.170
Pulp Fiction
Quentin Tarantino’s 1994 cult classic Pulp

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.280
Fiction follows the exploits of a plethora
of Los Angeles mobsters and criminals, and

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.709
includes a memorable scene in which Tim Roth’s
Ringo holds up a restaurant with a gun.

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.489
In the scene, Ringo asks the restaurant’s
coffee shop manager – played by Robert Ruth

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.880
– if he’s going to be a hero.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.180
Ruth’s character tries to respond by saying
“I am not a hero.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.790
I’m just a coffee shop manager”, but is
cut off before he gets the word “manager”

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:48.370
out and ends up saying “I am not a hero.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.430
I’m just a coffee shop”.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:53.860
As a result, he is hilariously listed in the
credits with the character name “Coffee

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.010
Shop”.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.629
Mallrats
Mallrats is another cult movie, from 1995

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.409
and directed by Kevin Smith, which follows
two best friends as they seek refuge in a

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.500
local mall after their girlfriends dump them.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.909
Smith likes to mention his parents in the
credits of the movies he directs and Mallrats

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.390
provides the best and funniest example of
him doing that.

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.879
In the credits, he simply thanks his Mom and
Dad “for having sex all those years ago.”

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:21.079
It’s simple, straight to the point and pretty
damn funny.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.560
Mr. Popper’s Penguins
2011’s Mr. Poppper’s Penguins sees Thomas

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.150
Popper – played by Jim Carrey – inheriting
a group of penguins from his father.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.120
Although some of the penguin scenes used seamless
CGI, there were also some real trained penguins

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.120
used in the movie.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.530
As a result, a message was included in the
credits to clarify that none of them came

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.280
to any harm in the movie – but it also included
a humorous add-on about Carrey.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.520
Specifically, the message said that “No
penguins were harmed in the making of this

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.520
film.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.190
Jim Carrey, on the other hand, was bitten
mercilessly.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:52.120
But he had it coming.”

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.350
Guardians of the Galaxy
2104’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a superhero

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.260
movie that brings together a group of space
misfits in the Marvel Cinematic Universe;

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.880
The outlaw Star-Lord, the assassin Gamora,
the vengeful Drax, and the endearing and unlikely

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.669
pairing of the talking raccoon known as Rocket
and the tree-like humanoid Groot.

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.229
Rocket and Groot were, of course, created
using CGI, but Marvel Studios still opted

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:17.139
to include a humorous message in the credits
that stated "No raccoons or tree creatures

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.950
were harmed during the making of this film."

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:27.750
Deadpool
Although these particular jokes in 2016’s

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.240
Deadpool movie credits can hardly be described
as “hidden”, audience members still had

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.030
to be paying attention in order to see them.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.080
Occurring at the start of the movie, rather
than at the end like the other entries in

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.690
this list, Deadpool’s opening credits didn’t
list any of the names of the people who worked

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.919
on the movie, but simply listed a load of
stereotypes instead – these credits are

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.360
basically a roasting of every Hollywood film
studio in existence.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.800
For example, the producers are listed as “asshats”,
the director is named as “an overpaid tool”

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.570
and the writers are labelled “the real heroes
here”.

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.570
Brilliant.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.420
