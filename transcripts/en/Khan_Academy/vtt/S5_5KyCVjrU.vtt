00:00:00.497 --> 00:00:02.811
- [Instructor] The distribution
of resting pulse rates

00:00:02.811 --> 00:00:05.600
of all students at Santa Maria High School

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.969
was approximately normal with
mean of 80 beats per minute

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.492
and standard deviation
of nine beats per minute.

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:15.742
The school nurse plans
to provide additional

00:00:15.742 --> 00:00:18.737
screening to students
whose resting pulse rates

00:00:18.737 --> 00:00:22.892
are in the top 30% of the
students who were tested.

00:00:22.892 --> 00:00:26.574
What is the minimum resting
pulse rate at that school

00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:30.348
for students who will
receive additional screening?

00:00:30.348 --> 00:00:32.642
Round to the nearest whole number.

00:00:32.642 --> 00:00:34.287
If you feel like you
know how to tackle this,

00:00:34.287 --> 00:00:38.102
I encourage you to pause this
video and try to work it out.

00:00:38.102 --> 00:00:41.242
All right, now let's
work this out together.

00:00:41.242 --> 00:00:43.444
They're telling us that the distribution

00:00:43.444 --> 00:00:47.079
of resting pulse rates
are approximately normal.

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.948
So we could use a normal distribution.

00:00:49.948 --> 00:00:51.187
And they tell us several things

00:00:51.187 --> 00:00:53.407
about this normal distribution.

00:00:53.407 --> 00:00:56.567
They tell us that the mean
is 80 beats per minute.

00:00:56.567 --> 00:00:59.281
So that is the mean right over there.

00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:00.661
And they tell us that
the standard deviation

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:02.934
is nine beats per minute.

00:01:02.934 --> 00:01:05.027
So on this normal distribution,

00:01:05.027 --> 00:01:07.830
we have one standard
deviation above the mean,

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.594
two standard deviations above the mean,

00:01:09.594 --> 00:01:12.070
so this distance right over here is nine.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.718
So this would be 89.

00:01:13.718 --> 00:01:16.083
This one right over here would be 98.

00:01:16.083 --> 00:01:18.010
And you could also go standard
deviations below the mean,

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.975
this right over here would
be 71, this would be 62,

00:01:21.975 --> 00:01:25.527
but what we're concerned
about is the top 30%

00:01:25.527 --> 00:01:28.867
because that is who is going to be tested.

00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:32.370
So there's gonna be some
value here, some threshold.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.623
Let's say it is right over here,

00:01:35.623 --> 00:01:38.123
that if you are at that score,

00:01:39.489 --> 00:01:41.729
you have reached the minimum threshold

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.379
to get an additional screening.

00:01:43.379 --> 00:01:46.430
You are in the top 30%.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.633
So that means that this
area right over here

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:52.216
is going to be 30% or 0.3.

00:01:56.454 --> 00:01:59.164
So what we can do, we can use a z-table

00:01:59.164 --> 00:02:02.395
to say for what z-score is 70%

00:02:02.395 --> 00:02:05.081
of the distribution less than that.

00:02:05.081 --> 00:02:06.941
And then we can take that z-score

00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:09.729
and use the mean and
the standard deviation

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.143
to come up with an actual value.

00:02:13.143 --> 00:02:15.396
In previous examples, we
started with the z-score

00:02:15.396 --> 00:02:17.258
and were looking for the percentage.

00:02:17.258 --> 00:02:19.946
This time we're looking
for the percentage.

00:02:19.946 --> 00:02:22.687
We want it to be at least 70%

00:02:22.687 --> 00:02:25.649
and then come up with the
corresponding z-score.

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:27.765
So let's see, immediately
when we look at this,

00:02:27.765 --> 00:02:30.358
and we are to the right of the mean,

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:32.197
and so we're gonna have
a positive z-score.

00:02:32.197 --> 00:02:34.126
So we're starting at 50% here.

00:02:34.126 --> 00:02:38.293
We definitely want to
get to the 67%, 68, 69,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.448
we're getting close and on our table

00:02:41.448 --> 00:02:44.402
this is the lowest z-score

00:02:44.402 --> 00:02:48.893
that gets us across that 70% threshold.

00:02:48.893 --> 00:02:50.143
It's at 0.7019.

00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:55.663
So it definitely crosses the threshold.

00:02:55.663 --> 00:02:58.413
And so that is a z-score of 0.53.

00:03:00.817 --> 00:03:02.400
0.52 is too little.

00:03:04.448 --> 00:03:06.865
So we need a z-score of 0.53.

00:03:08.744 --> 00:03:10.577
Let's write that down.

00:03:11.612 --> 00:03:13.529
0.53, right over there,

00:03:15.992 --> 00:03:17.198
and we just now have to figure out

00:03:17.198 --> 00:03:20.935
what value gives us a z-score of 0.53.

00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:22.881
Well, this just means 0.53

00:03:22.881 --> 00:03:25.950
standard deviations above the mean.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:26.992
So to get the value,

00:03:26.992 --> 00:03:30.161
we would take our mean and we would add

00:03:30.161 --> 00:03:32.161
0.53 standard deviation.

00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:35.746
So 0.53 times nine.

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:40.017
And this will get us 0.53

00:03:43.167 --> 00:03:45.417
times nine is equal to 4.77

00:03:46.906 --> 00:03:49.073
plus 80 is equal to 84.77.

00:03:53.102 --> 00:03:54.935
84.77 and they want us

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:58.818
to round to the nearest whole number.

00:03:58.818 --> 00:04:02.501
So we will just round
to 85 beats per minute.

00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:03.859
So that's the threshold.

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.989
If you have that resting heartbeat,

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.897
then the school nurse is going

00:04:07.897 --> 00:04:09.585
to give you some additional screening.

00:04:09.585 --> 00:04:13.752
You are in the top 30% of
students who are tested.
