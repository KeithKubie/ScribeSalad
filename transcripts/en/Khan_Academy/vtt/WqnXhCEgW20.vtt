00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.720
The probability of winning
the Powerball lottery

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.550
is 1 in 175,223,511.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.710
I'm assuming this is when you
buy a Powerball lottery ticket.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:12.686
This is a probability.

00:00:12.686 --> 00:00:14.560
Then they tell us the
probability of becoming

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:20.560
a billionaire in the
United States is 0.000001.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.620
Which is more likely?

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.200
And I assume this
is like saying,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.060
if you were to randomly
select a person at birth, what

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.980
is the probability
that that person is

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.530
going to become a billionaire?

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.490
And that's this number
right over here.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.170
And just looking at this,
it's kind of hard to compare.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.550
So let me try to write the
second number, this decimal,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.134
as a fraction.

00:00:38.134 --> 00:00:39.508
And then we might
be able to make

00:00:39.508 --> 00:00:40.970
more of a direct comparison.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.140
So 0 point-- and let's
see, we have five 0's.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.650
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.300
And then we have a 1.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.110
And so let's just think about
what place that 1 is in.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.940
This is in the tenths place.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.710
That's the tenths place, that's
the hundredths place, that's

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.220
the thousandths place, that's
the ten thousandths place,

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.470
and that's the hundred
thousandths place.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.890
And this right over here
is the millionths place.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.300
So this 1 literally
represents 1/1,000,000.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.630
So this is the exact same thing.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.660
This is equivalent
to 1 over 1 million.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.100
This is 1/1,000,000.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.030
This is 1/775,223,511.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.860
So this whole thing,
this whole expression

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.337
here is a much smaller value.

00:01:36.337 --> 00:01:37.420
We had the same numerator.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.200
We have a 1 in both cases.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.960
This denominator is much larger.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.640
So this entire fraction
is much, much smaller,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.620
actually, by roughly a
factor of 175-- much smaller.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.430
This is roughly 1
over 175 million.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.520
This is 1 over 1 million.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.210
So which is more likely?

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.310
Which is more likely if you
were to pick a random person who

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.230
bought a lottery ticket, and
the probability of them winning

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.130
the Powerball lottery, or if
you were to pick a random person

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.940
and you'd say the probability
of them becoming a billionaire?

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.080
It's actually far more likely--
roughly 175 times more likely--

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.590
that that person could
become a billionaire.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.472
So much more likely
becoming a billionaire.
