- True Blood is halfway
through its final season,

00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:04.871
and I'm really bummed
because where else

00:00:04.871 --> 00:00:06.306
on HBO are you gonna be able

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:08.274
to see graphic violence and sex?

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:11.277
(audience whoops and cheers)

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:12.779
Here to, did you just cheer that

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:14.447
because I said violence and sex?

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:15.281
You didn't even hear any--

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:16.649
(audience cheers)

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.852 align:start size:94% position:6%
You're not even listening
to anything else

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.320
other than violence and sex.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.154
(audience cheers)

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:21.988
