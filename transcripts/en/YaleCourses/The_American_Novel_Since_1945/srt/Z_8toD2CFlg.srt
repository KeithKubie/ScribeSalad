1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,380
Last time I finished up my lectures on
wise blood by trying to draw together

2
00:00:09,091 --> 00:00:14,040
three different ways of reading the
novel into one interpretive framework.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,760
And what I ultimately argued was that the
new critical formal unity of the novel

4
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,650
that is epitomized, I
think in a somewhat, uh,

5
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,730
perhaps heavy handed way in chapter seven
of the novel that's bookended by the,

6
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,790
the symbol of the blinding white cloud.

7
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,210
That it's that unity in
a sense that replaces the
bodily unity's that are always

8
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:46,050
blown apart in O'connor's fiction.
And in a certain way,

9
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,200
what you see is a fiction
that is personified in that
way that it takes on the

10
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:59,340
qualities and the values of the person.
And for O'connor,

11
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:03,900
that means the person understood in a
religious framework as something with

12
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:08,490
transcendent meaning and transcendent
value and indeed a transcendent life.

13
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,100
There's a very different image of
the personified word in Lolita.

14
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,300
And I'm going to refer now to an essay
in 1992 essay by the British novelist

15
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,500
Martin Amos,
he compares the [inaudible],

16
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,460
the prose style in Lolita
with a muscle bound man,

17
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:38,570
a man whose body is bulked up
purely for aesthetic reasons,

18
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,990
for only the purpose of looking a certain
way that the body builder is not that

19
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,620
person who's going to go out and
use their muscles to do some job.

20
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,800
It is simply there to be looked at,
to be oiled,

21
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:58,590
up and presented and displayed.

22
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:03,870
That's how Amos describes
the pro style of Lolita.

23
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,600
So I want you to keep
that image in your mind.

24
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,750
The question of the relationship between
the person and the aesthetic in the

25
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:16,771
Lita is going to be at the heart of my
overarching argument about the novel

26
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,690
today. You're not going to see much
of that. What I want to do today. Um,

27
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,120
since we have three lectures on Lolita,

28
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:30,350
what I want to do today is simply to
begin to open the text for you to give you

29
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:35,430
some ways of reading it, to alert
you to certain kinds of questions,

30
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:40,820
to ask you some overarching questions and
also to just get you thinking and into

31
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:44,640
the texture of the novel.
Um,

32
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,170
first I want to ask you though, uh,
what do you think of this so far?

33
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,930
I just want to hear from you.
What are your responses?

34
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:00,460
Who, who, who really hates this
novel so far? Anybody? Yes. Okay.

35
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:01,570
Why do you hate this novel?

36
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,560
I guess just because of the fact that
he's doing something that's really that

37
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:08,960
good and it almost seems
like it's trivializing it.

38
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,920
What about it trivializes that crime?

39
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,120
Um, I'm going to guess just that there's
no moral lens that we're looking at it

40
00:03:20,121 --> 00:03:22,760
through.
It's just his deal with the world.

41
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:24,401
Okay.

42
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:29,401
So Humberto lack of a moral vocabulary
to understand what he's doing makes it

43
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:33,700
seem like it's true. Realized.
Okay. Other thoughts on this?

44
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:37,600
Who else is really put off by this subject
matter? Even if you like the novel,

45
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:40,690
who else was really put off by this?
Yes,

46
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,500
I agree with that.

47
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,790
I like it's disturbing how much you can
identify with her up like we're made to

48
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:51,791
see the world through his eyes and kind
of like even like I grew to like him,

49
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,343
like

50
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,110
presented.

51
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:00,060
He's a very likable character designs
and then it's kind of like good things

52
00:04:00,061 --> 00:04:02,390
that you do.
He does are kind of on the side.

53
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,430
It's just like when you think
about it in like a very,

54
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,500
like the whole telling of the story,
it's like not objective at all.

55
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:10,320
And when you think of it in
an objective sort of way,

56
00:04:10,321 --> 00:04:11,700
it's completely different story.

57
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,990
Okay, so, so you're,

58
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,360
you're suggesting is that what's so
disturbing about this is that we actually

59
00:04:18,361 --> 00:04:22,640
like the sky, we actually come to
like Humbert. How many of you know,

60
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,960
I asked you this question
about a O'connor's characters.

61
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:26,880
Would you like to sit down
to dinner with any of them?

62
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,700
Would you like to sit down
to dinner with Humbard?

63
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:33,660
And I would say this knowing that all
of us are outside the Nim fat age range.

64
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,730
So given that who would like to
sit down with Humbert and why?

65
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,440
Okay. Yes. You why?

66
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,180
Um, well, uh, simply because
I would argue that, um,

67
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:52,560
Humber in fact does have a
moral vocabulary and held
those terrible the things

68
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:53,410
he's doing are,

69
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,190
and yet we like him anyway and I think
that's the power of your novel and that's

70
00:04:57,191 --> 00:04:58,690
why I making such a persuasive character.

71
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,590
Okay.

72
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,590
Do you think that Humbert really
believes that his actions are terrible?

73
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:11,470
Do you believe him when he
says, oh, I was so ashamed,

74
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:16,360
I was so awful. Do you believe
him? No. Oh, you don't?

75
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,930
Okay. All right. Does
anyone believe it? Yes.

76
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:20,770
Well,

77
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,770
sometimes he brings up these
classic failures that he
argues would have the same

78
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:28,130
interest.
And it seems like this dad,

79
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,200
you mentioned Virgil Dante,
it seems like this,

80
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,700
the desperation of bringing
up such like grand figures.

81
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,560
So makes me think that you guys have down

82
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,390
about what he's doing. Uh
Huh. Uh Huh. So, so the,

83
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:47,420
the authority of the Canon that he
invokes to defend himself in fact suggest

84
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,550
perhaps that he has some
doubts. Yeah. Hmm. Yes.

85
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:51,481
That's interesting.

86
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:54,870
I took this camera to the exact opposite
way [inaudible] is I thought that

87
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,630
essentially referred to the temporality
of our moral structure and how it's just

88
00:05:59,631 --> 00:06:04,300
this arbitrary, um, coach our
societies and decided apartment.

89
00:06:04,301 --> 00:06:06,330
Have you at one point in
time you've got Mansfield,

90
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,250
the end of the old Latin world
in the BC world, when, you know,

91
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,260
people can have these child slaves.

92
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,600
Right, right. Yeah. So, okay.

93
00:06:16,601 --> 00:06:20,800
So this evidence is
very possible to see in,

94
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,540
in diametrically opposed ways,

95
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,450
and you're certainly not the first
two students that I've seen have,

96
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,680
have those two different reactions to
the same thing. What else do you, uh,

97
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,590
what else does this novel bring
out in you? What other thoughts?

98
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:33,850
What other responses

99
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:42,020
does anyone absolutely love this novel?
Okay.

100
00:06:42,021 --> 00:06:45,320
Lots of you good. Why?
Who was a, tell me why.

101
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,280
Yes. Uh, the beauty of the
language and the imagery. I mean,

102
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:53,920
just the sentence structure,
the in choice,

103
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,900
I guess going away from perhaps the
theme. Um, more of just the language.

104
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,360
Okay. The language. Yeah, absolutely.

105
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,410
Even more about the way in which
it's not just that it's beautiful.

106
00:07:04,411 --> 00:07:09,240
It's sort of like draws attention to the
power of words because of like you've

107
00:07:09,241 --> 00:07:12,780
been sort of trying to ask us whether
or not we find him sympathetic.

108
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:15,270
And I think, um, in
this book we're sort of,

109
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,630
I'm reminded of how
words can make us feel.

110
00:07:18,631 --> 00:07:23,450
Things can make us believe things that
are repugnant to us and sort of masks and

111
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,870
it's sort of like takes the mask off
literature and shows us the way we are

112
00:07:27,871 --> 00:07:28,704
convinced.

113
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,140
Okay.
Takes the mask off literature.

114
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:34,050
Actually want to change that around if
I might. And play with that cause I,

115
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,610
that's a really useful image for us.

116
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:40,320
Takes the mask off literature and reminds
us how we come to be sympathetic or

117
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:42,750
how we come to think something.
Um,

118
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,010
think back to Richard Wright
who wants words to disappear,

119
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,280
to be completely transparent and to
leave you just with your response in a

120
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:55,230
certain way.
I would want to flip your image around.

121
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,820
It's as if Nabar cough allows us to see
the mask of literature to actually see

122
00:07:59,821 --> 00:07:59,941
it.

123
00:07:59,941 --> 00:08:04,941
They're probably doing its work so we
can become self aware of how we respond.

124
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,200
But how many of you didn't experience
it as understanding why you were having

125
00:08:14,101 --> 00:08:16,650
that response to Humbert
but just having it,

126
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,210
were any of you sort of
experiencing this more like right?

127
00:08:21,211 --> 00:08:24,390
Wants us to experience literature
to just have the response?

128
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,060
Anyone really seduced?
Yeah,

129
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,250
well I found that like wow,

130
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:34,620
I might have found that the pros
more or less like relentless,

131
00:08:34,621 --> 00:08:37,950
like going back and forth in between
really trusting you these words and

132
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:38,910
banishing through that.

133
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:42,430
They were also points where I was
very aware of how they are, we feel,

134
00:08:42,431 --> 00:08:45,000
but I think what I never really,

135
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,430
it was very difficult to escape to my
own like ration and you were very much

136
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:54,960
cemented inside with you. Like there
wasn't much of an escape from his,

137
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,213
which I thought was

138
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,480
okay. Yes. Do we ever
escape from his head?

139
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:04,590
You're saying that you don't,
you didn't feel like you ever could in,

140
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,120
in the world of this prose.

141
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,990
This is going to be an important question
for us as we think about what happens

142
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:11,970
to Lolita over the course of the novel.

143
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:17,100
Do we ever escape from the
subjectivity of Humbard?

144
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:22,020
Is there any way to access the
subjectivity of Lolita herself?

145
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,320
So this is one question you want to ask
yourself and if there are moments when

146
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,410
something like Nepal coughs,

147
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:36,420
voice or point of view shades into
hummingbirds, what are those moments,

148
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:41,280
if you think there are some, what are
the moments when that subjectivity,

149
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:45,000
this sort of prison of
that subjectivity waivers?

150
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,650
Where do you see those? I'll, I'll
leave that as a question for you. Well,

151
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:52,350
let me give you a little bit
of background. It's, it's, uh,

152
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:55,750
it's very helpful for me as I
address you to think about, um,

153
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,600
what you're seeing in the text and that,

154
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,500
that helps me to think about
what I want to say to you. Um,

155
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,380
so before I get into that,
let me just give you some background.

156
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:07,050
Some of you probably know a little
bit about in a back office life.

157
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:12,290
He was born in 1899 and his life to me
is fascinating because he was one of the

158
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:18,621
last generation raised in the old
aristocratic chateau life of Russia.

159
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:29,010
And it wasn't just a
Russian, uh, aristocracy.

160
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:33,930
It was really a very cosmopolitan
European aristocracy. Um,

161
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,200
he lived in,
uh,

162
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,640
in the summers on a country estate
outside St Petersburg and a beautiful

163
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,601
chateau.

164
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:46,860
And his uncle owned the chateau down the
road and actually left it to him when

165
00:10:46,861 --> 00:10:49,080
he was a very young man.
Um,

166
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,170
so he actually owned
for a short time this,

167
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,700
this huge chateau and other relatives
and friends lived in the states

168
00:10:56,701 --> 00:11:01,010
surrounding there is, it had huge
parks as part of its land, um,

169
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,100
where he first learned to hunt
butterflies and mount them,

170
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,000
and he became a serious
Lepadopa tourist. Um, as he,

171
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,150
as he grew older and was
very early in his life,

172
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:16,290
passionate about collecting
and classifying a butterflies,

173
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,280
um, in the winters, he lived
in the city in a, in a,

174
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,120
in a beautiful townhouse
in Saint Petersburg.

175
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,680
And he attended school,
uh,

176
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,670
only later in his life when he was
young, as was the custom. He had tutors.

177
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,370
So he had a French tutor
who lived with him, um,

178
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:39,300
lived with the family for a long time.
Uh,

179
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:42,660
he had Russian and English
tutors that came in succession.

180
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,010
He had drawing masters,
um,

181
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,940
and so on to cover the range of education,

182
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:51,180
thought to be appropriate to young man,
a young man of his station.

183
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,720
His father was a Democrat in czarist,
Russia,

184
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,020
and he was quite a reformer,
um,

185
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:03,920
at the time that the Bolsheviks
took over in 1919. Um,

186
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:08,500
there was a brief window of time,
um,

187
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,700
prior to the family's flight in
the family left Russia in 1919.

188
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:17,700
So the revolution I think starts in 1917
and things are quite complex in those

189
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:21,580
early days. So there's more than
one auntie czarist, uh, factor.

190
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,060
And his father was a Democrat,
but not a Bolshevik,

191
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,340
so he was Auntie's ours, but
he was not a Bolshevik. Um, he,

192
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:35,370
his father wrote for revolutionary
newspapers and he continued to write and

193
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:38,290
publish a newspaper even as an emigre.

194
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,860
He was assassinated in 1922 in Europe,
um,

195
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:48,160
on, on account of his publishing
activities. Uh, Novakof was very,

196
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:52,960
very fond of his parents.
Um, he has these luminous,

197
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,580
luminous essays about his
life as a child in, in this,

198
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,810
um, sort of perfectly
intact aristocratic world.

199
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,700
And in that picture,

200
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:07,960
his mother and father loom very
large and in a very fond light,

201
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,680
nearly invisible are
his, uh, or his siblings.

202
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:13,990
He had two brothers and two sisters.

203
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:19,240
And it's amazing when you read his
memoirs, um, how invisible they are.

204
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,950
Uh, this is one thing I find
striking about those memoirs. Um,

205
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:28,480
but it's an interesting thing to
ponder as we think about Lolita. Uh,

206
00:13:28,481 --> 00:13:31,570
it's the image of a
person who is profoundly,

207
00:13:31,571 --> 00:13:33,730
at least in his representation of himself,

208
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,200
profoundly occupied with what's
going on in his own mind.

209
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:42,610
His parents were very much
absent from his growing up life.

210
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:46,780
He spent a lot of time with his nannies
and tutors and nurses when he was

211
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,860
younger, his parents would travel. Um,

212
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:55,510
and his father was often away in the
city on political business when they were

213
00:13:55,511 --> 00:14:00,460
in the country. So his parents loom large,
but not so much as physical figures,

214
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,060
uh, people he would interact
with in a daily sense,

215
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:09,040
but almost as icons or as or as
figures of the imagination for him.

216
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,810
Um, the real people he was sort of
with, certainly his brother's Sergei,

217
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:18,640
who he was educated with. His sisters
were educated in a different way. Um,

218
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,260
and we're somewhat younger than him.

219
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,980
Even Sergey is sort of invisible to him.

220
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,280
He wrote literature in Russian novels
in Russian when he was in Europe.

221
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:35,710
And then when he moved
to the United States,

222
00:14:35,711 --> 00:14:40,711
he began to write in English and took
America as his adopted land and his,

223
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,260
uh,
English as his adopted language.

224
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:48,910
English was a native language in a certain
way because English was spoken in his

225
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:53,900
household all the time and he was by
an English governess as a young child.

226
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,490
So it, it's a deep, it's a language that
goes deep in his, in his upbringing.

227
00:14:58,491 --> 00:15:02,180
It's not, um, it's not
really analogous. Um,

228
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,690
well I'm not gonna I, I'm not
going to get into that. Um,

229
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,620
it's not analogous to say Conrad who is
Polish and learned English and you can

230
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:17,810
see the marks and Conrad's fiction
of his having learned English.

231
00:15:17,811 --> 00:15:22,010
And then as he's writing in it, it
comes across as a sort of clotted style.

232
00:15:22,011 --> 00:15:25,790
And Conrad, some of the difficulty of
Conrad's style is the difficulty of,

233
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,750
of writing in this acquired language.
Novakof has none of that.

234
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:32,943
MMM.

235
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,950
So what I want to do now is
with that background in mind,

236
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:44,090
I want to take this up and just open up
the first few pages and I urge you not

237
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:45,804
to neglect.

238
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,833
Okay.

239
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:54,740
The forward by John Ray Jr.
So I hope you read it.

240
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,670
The little I tell size
forward and I want to focus,

241
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,480
especially on pages four and five.

242
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:08,030
Now forward is of course
supposed to suggest how you
should read the text that's

243
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:09,800
coming.
Um,

244
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:14,960
and so if we take it on in that role,
um,

245
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:18,500
let's see what we see.
I'm going to read a little bit of this.

246
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,920
This is on page four and five.

247
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,133
Okay.

248
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:29,560
For the benefit of old fashioned readers
who wished to follow the destinies of

249
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:32,140
the real people beyond the true story,

250
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:37,030
a few details may be given
as received from Mr Wind,

251
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:42,040
Mueller Ramsdale who desires his identity
suppressed so that the long shadow of

252
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:42,761
this,
sorry,

253
00:16:42,761 --> 00:16:47,080
and sorted business should not reach
the community to which he is proud to

254
00:16:47,081 --> 00:16:50,980
belong. His daughter, Louise
is by now a college sophomore.

255
00:16:50,981 --> 00:16:53,560
Moana doll is a student in Paris.

256
00:16:53,561 --> 00:16:57,910
Rita has recently married the
proprietor of a hotel in Florida.

257
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:03,330
Mrs. Richard F Schiller died in childbirth
giving birth to a stillborn girl on

258
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:06,820
Christmas Day 1952 in gray star,

259
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,490
a settlement in the remotest northwest.

260
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,980
Vivian dark bloom has written a biography,
my cue to be published shortly.

261
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:17,980
And critics who have perused the
manuscript call it her best book,

262
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:23,200
the caretakers of the various cemeteries
involved report that no ghosts walk

263
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:27,160
first. Let me point to you, uh,

264
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:30,880
you to this notation about
Mrs. Richard F Schiller.

265
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:36,040
I'm not going to tell you who that is,
but I want you to figure it out. Okay?

266
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,370
So make a note in your notebook
by the end of the novel,

267
00:17:39,371 --> 00:17:40,930
I would like you to know who this is.

268
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,470
Vivian dark bloom,
Vivian dark bloom.

269
00:17:47,471 --> 00:17:52,230
If you take those letters,
you can spell Vladimir Nabokov.

270
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,670
Vivian dark bloom is one of
Nepal coughs, um, Palindromic,

271
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,520
uh,
versions of his name.

272
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,700
He inserts these even in his
autobiography, by the way, he,

273
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,270
he attribute certain things to,
to uh,

274
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,340
Vivian dark bloomin' and other kinds
of characters have such names. Um,

275
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:16,550
so here you can't avoid the sense that
even though this is attributed to John

276
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,080
Ray,
in fact,

277
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:27,081
there is some other voice here and it's
a voice that can't help but drop the

278
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:32,070
name of lot of mirror in
Dubach off into the pros.

279
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,373
Okay.

280
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:39,470
So right away in this moment of layered
narratives and narrow a frame narrative

281
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,380
around another narrative,

282
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,720
there's a sort of instability
in the layers where is,

283
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,510
where is Nebach off here?

284
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,110
Yeah.

285
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,620
There's also the question of
what kind of reader we are,

286
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,700
that this preface brings up and
sort of puts in front of us.

287
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,170
Are we the kind of reader who is
interested in the real persons?

288
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,840
Well, it has this, uh,
it gives the, the, um,

289
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:17,200
the story that's to follow that sense
of being true because it suggests it's

290
00:19:19,221 --> 00:19:21,830
fictional city as a thin veneer.

291
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,450
And that the real is something
that we can know about.

292
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,860
And I would suggest to you
that we can connect this

293
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,463
with

294
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,120
Humberto moment of wondering what happens
to the little girls whose images he,

295
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,190
uh, is excited by. This is on page 21.

296
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,620
I have often wondered,
beginning of chapter six,

297
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:59,070
what became of those Nim phets later in
this wrought iron world of criss cross

298
00:19:59,561 --> 00:20:00,700
cause and effect.

299
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:06,150
Could it be that the hidden throb I stole
from them did not affect their future?

300
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,180
I had possessed her and she never knew it.
All right,

301
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,570
but would did not tell sometime later
had I not somehow tampered with her fate

302
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,960
by involving her image
in my velocity toss. Oh,

303
00:20:19,961 --> 00:20:24,220
it was and remains a source
of great and terrible wonder.

304
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:32,250
Both Humbert and John Ray suggest
that the tissue between the fictional,

305
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:38,410
between the imagination
and the Rio is very light,

306
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,500
that it can be pierced somehow that one
can affect the other and I want to point

307
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:49,540
you to a a kind of language.

308
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:51,490
Yeah.

309
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:56,320
That also permeates between the
preface and the story proper.

310
00:20:56,321 --> 00:20:58,000
And this is on page five.

311
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,710
This is the middle paragraph.

312
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:08,670
This commentator may be excused for
repeating what he has stressed in his own

313
00:21:08,951 --> 00:21:09,940
books and lectures,

314
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:15,180
namely that offensive is frequently a
synonym for unusual and a great work of

315
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:17,200
art is of course always original.

316
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,000
And thus by its very nature should come
as a more or less shocking surprise.

317
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,830
I have no intention to glorify
h h no doubt. He is horrible.

318
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,910
He is abject.
He is a shining example of moral leprosy,

319
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,560
a mixture of ferocity in jocularity
that betrays do pre misery perhaps,

320
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,960
but is not conducive to attractiveness.

321
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,780
He is ponderously capricious.

322
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,440
Many of his casual opinions on the
people and scenery of this country are

323
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:45,274
ludicrous.

324
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:50,080
A desperate honesty that throbs through
his confession does not absolve him from

325
00:21:50,081 --> 00:21:53,350
sins of diabolical cunning.
He is abnormal.

326
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,390
He's not a gentleman,

327
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:00,610
but how magically he's singing
violin can conjure up a tone dress.

328
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,020
How a compassion for lowly to that
makes us entranced with the book while a

329
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:06,550
pouring it's author,

330
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,780
you see that word throbs the desperate
honesty that throbs through his

331
00:22:12,821 --> 00:22:16,180
confession. Throbs is a book, is a book,

332
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,280
is a word that Nebach off

333
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:24,070
brings out over and over
again in multiple contexts.

334
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,850
Always connected somehow with this novel.

335
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:29,660
Yeah.

336
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:34,580
So I'm going to ask you to read the
afterword on a book entitled Lolita.

337
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:39,290
Um,
when you read that,

338
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:42,680
you'll notice that the
word throbs comes back.

339
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:48,020
The first impulse to write this
novel is described as a throb.

340
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,180
The throb is of course,

341
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,360
undeniably associated with Humberto
rising desire in that physical way.

342
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,110
And there's that emotional
ISED version of that.

343
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,560
The throbbing heart of Romantic cliche.

344
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:05,350
Yeah.

345
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:09,790
It comes back and forth in his
memoirs to and speak memory.

346
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,890
That word appears. It's interesting
as the essays move chronologically,

347
00:23:14,891 --> 00:23:19,360
they were written over a period of time
as the essays that were written near

348
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:20,950
Lolita come into the book.

349
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:25,420
That word appears also
describing various things.

350
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:30,570
It's as if that word really
embodies the feel of this novel.

351
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:36,880
And so like Vivian dark bloom,
that word suggest the permeability,

352
00:23:36,881 --> 00:23:41,620
not just of fiction and the
real but these narrative layers.

353
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,650
Where is Nabar cough?

354
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,340
And I think he's there in that
throng is there in that throb.

355
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:55,120
Now I want to ask a question that
we're going to need to think about and

356
00:23:55,161 --> 00:23:59,390
addresses the response of actually the
two of you sitting up front here. Um,

357
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,790
when I was asking you
how you responded to it,

358
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,840
can we have a moral response to this
novel and what would that look like?

359
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:09,870
Yeah.

360
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,710
Well John Ray asks us
to, and I want to, um,

361
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:19,070
just read part of that language
of morality that he uses.

362
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:23,940
I'm going to start on four and then I'm
going to skip down to the bottom of five.

363
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:26,730
Yeah.

364
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:31,730
Viewed simply as a novel Lolita deals
with situations and emotions that would

365
00:24:31,891 --> 00:24:36,180
remain IX exasperatingly vague to the
reader had their expression been ETLA

366
00:24:36,181 --> 00:24:39,750
aided by means of platitudinous
avail evasions true,

367
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,370
not a single obscene term is to be
found in the whole work. Indeed,

368
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:49,500
the robust Philistine who is conditioned
by modern conventions into accepting

369
00:24:49,501 --> 00:24:53,850
without qualms a lavish array of four
letter words in a banal novel will be

370
00:24:53,851 --> 00:24:56,610
quite shocked by their absence here.
If however,

371
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:01,500
for this paradoxical prudes comfort and
editor or attempted to dilute or omit

372
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:06,360
scenes that a certain type of mind
might call Aphrodisiac and then he makes

373
00:25:06,361 --> 00:25:11,361
reference to the court case in which you
Lucy's was was ruled not to be obscene

374
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:17,540
in 1933 one would have to forego the
publication of Lolita altogether.

375
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:22,440
Since those very scenes that one might
ineptly accuse of sensuous existence of

376
00:25:22,441 --> 00:25:26,610
their own are the most strictly functional
ones in the development of a tragic

377
00:25:26,611 --> 00:25:31,440
tale tending unswervingly to nothing
less than a moral apotheosis.

378
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,910
The cynic may say that commercial
pornography makes the same claim.

379
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,120
The learned may counter by
asserting that h h is in passion.

380
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:44,121
Confession is a tempest in a test tube
that at least 12% of American adult

381
00:25:44,131 --> 00:25:44,551
males,

382
00:25:44,551 --> 00:25:49,551
a conservative estimate according to Dr.
Bland Schwartzman verbal communication

383
00:25:49,741 --> 00:25:51,510
enjoy yearly in one way or another.

384
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:56,630
The special experience of h h that h h
describes with such despair that had our

385
00:25:57,121 --> 00:26:01,620
demented direst gone in the fateful
summer of 1947 to a competent

386
00:26:01,621 --> 00:26:04,440
psychopathology just there
would've been no disaster,

387
00:26:04,441 --> 00:26:06,900
but then neither would
there have been this book.

388
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,570
In this part,

389
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:15,200
he suggests the possibility of
the tale ending in a moral tale,

390
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,850
a moral apotheosis,

391
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,520
but that's grounded also or hedged around
by the sense of psychiatry offering

392
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,350
other ways of understanding
what we think of as deviance.

393
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,390
But this is hard to take
seriously for a number of reasons.

394
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,950
Not least.

395
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:42,160
The Doctor Blanche Schwarzman
who is referred to here
it is of course Dr. White,

396
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,430
black man.
And it's referring to the Kinsey report,

397
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,640
the famous Kinsey Report on the
sexual habits of Americans. Um,

398
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,100
that came out in the 1950s,
um, Dr. Black white men.

399
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:00,480
It suggests that these are matters of
the heart that have been reduced to a

400
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:02,790
black and white set of statistics.

401
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:07,140
And you feel the absurdity of that 12%,

402
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,030
that number appearing in that,
in that sentence right here,

403
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:18,030
and I'm just going to skip down to the
bottom of five. Now, as a case history,

404
00:27:18,031 --> 00:27:22,890
Lolita will become no doubt a classic
in psychiatric circles as a work of art.

405
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,670
It transcends its Xva, Xva tree, uh,

406
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:30,000
aspects and still more important
to us than scientific significance.

407
00:27:30,001 --> 00:27:34,440
And literary worth is the ethical impact
the book should have on this serious

408
00:27:34,441 --> 00:27:37,230
reader.
For in this poignant personal study,

409
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:41,910
there alerts a general lesson the way
we're child, the egotistic mother,

410
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:46,110
the panting maniac. These are not
only vivid characters in unique story,

411
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,840
they warn us of dangerous trends.

412
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,480
They point out potent evils,

413
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:55,560
Lolita should make all of us parents,
social workers,

414
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,080
educators apply ourselves,

415
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:02,730
was still greater vigilance and vision
to the task of bringing up a better

416
00:28:02,731 --> 00:28:05,370
generation in a safer world.
Well,

417
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:07,760
aren't those ringing words from John Ray?

418
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,520
Nabar cough ensures that the very idea
of taking a moral lesson from this novel

419
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:22,340
is unavailable to us because
it's already been ridiculed.

420
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:29,520
He not only makes us see the psychiatric
evasion of morality as ridiculous as

421
00:28:32,921 --> 00:28:37,480
Banal, as reductive reductive
to the black and white.

422
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:42,810
He ensures too that the language of
morality is the language of Cliche.

423
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:47,940
Yeah.

424
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,940
The status of cliche in this model is
one with which we're going to have to

425
00:28:53,251 --> 00:28:57,990
struggle and I want to,
uh, move in that direction.

426
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:03,660
Now by turning to our first
hearing of Humberto voice.

427
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:07,110
What can we say about Humbert style?

428
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:12,320
If John Ray's style is full of certain
kinds of cliches that we can classify in

429
00:29:13,441 --> 00:29:16,650
the ways that I have just done,
what about Humbert style?

430
00:29:16,651 --> 00:29:20,040
Where does it come from and
why is it so enchanting?

431
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:27,000
So let's just begin with that first
chapter, the tiny chapter, chapter one,

432
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:33,120
Lolita. Light of my
life, fire of my loins,

433
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:36,870
my sin, my soul. Low lead top,

434
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,610
the tip of the tongue,

435
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,700
taking a trip of three steps down the
Palette to tap at three on the teeth.

436
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,460
Low Lee ta,

437
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:52,710
the first thing he does is make us feel
words in our bodies and especially in

438
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:59,140
the mouth and in the tongue
in that very sensuous way.

439
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,860
So that's the first thing
that his style does for us.

440
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:08,250
It makes us align ourselves in the way
that some of you were talking about

441
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,203
earlier,

442
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:15,630
not just to identify our minds with the
point of view of this particular person,

443
00:30:16,091 --> 00:30:17,440
this particular character,

444
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:22,710
but actually to move your body and to
feel something bodily that he wants you to

445
00:30:24,881 --> 00:30:28,600
feel, to share that sensuous
experience with him.

446
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:34,560
It's just the first little temptation
he wants to draw us in to the special

447
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:41,200
experience that he,
that he documents in his story.

448
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:46,180
She was low plane, low in the
morning, standing four feet,

449
00:30:46,181 --> 00:30:50,680
10 in one sock. She was Lola in
slacks, she was Dolly at school.

450
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,990
She was Dolores on the dotted line,

451
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,080
but in my arms she was always Lolita.

452
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:02,270
Did she have a precursor? She did
indeed. She did. In point of fact,

453
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,590
there might've been no Lolita at
all had I not loved one summer,

454
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,750
a certain initial girl child
in a Princeton by the sea.

455
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:17,150
Oh, when about as many years
before Lolita was born,

456
00:31:17,151 --> 00:31:18,620
as my age was that summer,

457
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,160
you can always count on a
murderer for a fancy pro style.

458
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,720
Ladies and gentleman of the jury,
Exhibit Number One is what?

459
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:27,530
The Sarah [inaudible],

460
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:31,580
the misinformed simple Nobel
winged Sarah [inaudible] envied.

461
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:36,770
Look at this tangle of thorns.
I'm seduced or you,

462
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,210
he's feeding us questions.
This is another thing to notice.

463
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,200
He's not just making us experience
Lolita's name the way he does.

464
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,780
He's assuming that there are certain
kinds of questions that we will ask.

465
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:55,030
Did she have a precursor?

466
00:31:55,150 --> 00:32:00,150
Why is this the first question that you
would ask if someone was telling you

467
00:32:00,281 --> 00:32:04,990
this story? Is that the first question you
would ask? So did she have a precursor?

468
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:08,500
No, probably not. Okay. Why?

469
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:13,120
Why does he want to plant
this question with us? Well,

470
00:32:13,121 --> 00:32:17,470
he's working towards
something that he will also,

471
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,320
in some ways,
backhandedly does credit.

472
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:25,980
He's counting on us to analyze
him in somewhat Freudian terms.

473
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
So even though he will make a habit
later on of playing with psychiatrists,

474
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,240
staying at clinics extra weeks just to
bother the newcomers by giving them made

475
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:42,800
up dreams and primal scenes
to read and interpret.

476
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,030
Even though he's going to do that,

477
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:51,060
he still manipulating us because he knows
how deeply those kinds of exculpatory

478
00:32:53,411 --> 00:32:57,280
narratives run with his audience.

479
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:58,670
Yeah.

480
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:01,970
So she had a precursor.
So what does that make any difference?

481
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,870
Does that make any difference to how
we're to judge him and we are the judges,

482
00:33:05,871 --> 00:33:07,850
ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

483
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,540
we are in a way invited to judge

484
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:17,720
even though he's begging
us not to at every moment.

485
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:23,890
So it's a choice on Nabar coughs part
to foreground the question of judgement

486
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,640
from moment one.

487
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:27,330
Yeah.

488
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:32,310
And then for him to invoke
multiple kinds of exculpatory x,

489
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:35,100
I can't say that word.
Exculpatory narratives.

490
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:38,490
He's planting them in
there for us to find.

491
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:39,990
Okay.

492
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:42,810
Oh,
when in childhood.

493
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:48,410
By safely locating that precursor in
his own childhood when as he says he was

494
00:33:51,181 --> 00:33:54,750
her equal,
where there was no crime.

495
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:59,780
Only a kind of infant tile passion
that nobody would blame him for.

496
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:06,230
He invites us to think of

497
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:12,870
Humbert as somehow still retaining a
kind of innocent purity that that passion

498
00:34:14,651 --> 00:34:19,651
itself is the innocent purity that
flames at the heart of childhood.

499
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:28,020
Then we get these illusions and if you
have the annotated and little Leto,

500
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,270
or if you already know Po,

501
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:37,650
Annabel Lee is a famous poem by Edgar
Allan Poe and the Princeton by the sea is

502
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:40,743
a feature of it.

503
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:44,710
And so I'm going to read this to you and
there's a reason why I want to read the

504
00:34:44,711 --> 00:34:49,090
whole thing. So, um, it'll just
take a minute. But here we go.

505
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,380
This is Annabel Lee.

506
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,160
Yeah,

507
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,150
it was many in many a year
ago in a kingdom by the sea.

508
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:02,660
That maiden they're lived whom you may
know by the name of Annabel Lee and this

509
00:35:03,751 --> 00:35:08,640
maiden she lived with no other thought
than to love and be loved by me.

510
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,280
She was a child and I was a
child in this kingdom by the sea.

511
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,580
But we loved with a love
that was more than love.

512
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:22,320
I and my Annabel Lee with a love that
the wing and Sarah [inaudible] of heaven

513
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:24,390
coveted her and me.

514
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:30,090
And this was the reason that long
ago in this kingdom by the sea,

515
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:35,350
a wind blew out of a cloud by night
chilling my Annabel Lee so that her high

516
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:40,701
born kinsmen came bore her away from me
to shut her up in a separate occur in

517
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:42,840
this kingdom by the sea.

518
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:44,370
Okay.

519
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:49,170
The angels, not half. So happy
in heaven went envying her in me.

520
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:53,550
Yes, that was the reason as all
men, no in this kingdom by the sea,

521
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,860
that the wind came out of a cloud
chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.

522
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,870
But our love,

523
00:36:00,871 --> 00:36:05,400
it was stronger by far than the love
of those who were older than we have,

524
00:36:05,401 --> 00:36:09,840
many far wiser than we had.
Neither the angels in heaven above,

525
00:36:09,841 --> 00:36:14,841
nor the demons down under the sea can
ever discover my soul from the soul of the

526
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:18,030
beautiful Annabel Lee for the moon.

527
00:36:18,031 --> 00:36:23,031
Never beams without bringing me dreams
of the beautiful Annabel Lee and the

528
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:25,020
stars never arise.

529
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:28,770
But I see the bright eyes of
the beautiful Annabel Lee.

530
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,810
And so all the night tide,
I lie down by the side of my darling,

531
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:37,730
my darling, my life, and my
bride in her separate Kirk,

532
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:42,030
thereby the C in her tomb
by the side of the sea.

533
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,980
So that's the whole poem.

534
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,020
Humbert is drawing on

535
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:58,470
a 19th century romantic tradition
that still has a certain power.

536
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:05,100
You can hear that in cantilatory voice
of Poe's speaker in the poem making this

537
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,890
doomed love into something aesthetic.

538
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:22,100
But it's also a kind of cliche.

539
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:23,580
Okay,

540
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,020
if John Ray

541
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,230
okay

542
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:32,230
works with the cliches of
psychiatry and of social work

543
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,760
and in a way of politics,

544
00:37:37,761 --> 00:37:41,630
progressive politics bring up a
better generation for the future.

545
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:48,070
Hummingbird has truck with
the cliches of the literary.

546
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,620
So he,

547
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:56,030
his is a vocabulary of
very high born cliches.

548
00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:01,820
It's interesting when you read speak
memory in Dubach offs, autobiography.

549
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:06,821
He talks about his own experiments with
this kind of poetry when he was young

550
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:11,520
and especially when he was beginning
to fall in love with girls, uh,

551
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,600
that he would meet around
a Saint Petersburg.

552
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:20,830
He represents them as overheated attempts
at literature as dripping with a kind

553
00:38:23,661 --> 00:38:24,710
of access,

554
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:29,860
romantic excess as essentially unable
to do more than repeat a tradition.

555
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,880
What Humbard has,

556
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,250
and I guess in a back off
has given him in the Po,

557
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:45,090
is not only that kind of overheated
romantic poetic reference,

558
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:53,260
he's also chosen of course
someone who married a very,

559
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:55,930
very young bride.
So Po,

560
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:01,060
I think at the age of about 2021
married his 14 year old cousin.

561
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:08,230
So for that reason po becomes a kind of
marble and he's the model in both ways,

562
00:39:10,701 --> 00:39:15,701
both as a both as a pedophile and as
someone who imagined himself and his young

563
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:26,651
love fully clothed in
the language of romance.

564
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,420
So it's a kind of fairy tale,

565
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,870
the fairy tale language

566
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:38,450
that is invoked here.

567
00:39:38,451 --> 00:39:40,790
The Princeton by the sea

568
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:50,140
is brought back for us
vividly in the scene where,

569
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:51,903
okay

570
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:56,320
Humbert first sees Lolita.

571
00:39:58,060 --> 00:39:59,800
This is on page 39

572
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,243
great.

573
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,490
So He's walking through the house.

574
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:12,510
The haze woman is giving
him his tour of the house.

575
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:14,810
Okay.

576
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:18,350
I was still walking behind Mrs. Hayes
through the dining room. When beyond it,

577
00:40:18,351 --> 00:40:20,210
there came a sudden burst of greenery.

578
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:25,070
The piatsa saying out my leader
and then without the least warning,

579
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,550
a see a blue seaweeds swells, sorry. Yeah.

580
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:33,840
A blue sea wave swelled under my
heart and from a mat in a pool of sun,

581
00:40:33,921 --> 00:40:36,500
half naked, kneeling,
turning about on her knees.

582
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:40,760
There was my Riviera love peering
at me over dark sunglasses.

583
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:45,530
It was the same child, the same
frail honey, huge shoulders,

584
00:40:45,531 --> 00:40:49,580
the same silky, supple, bare back,
the same chestnut head of hair,

585
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,060
a polka dot or the black current
chief tied around her chest.

586
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:57,170
He had from my aging eyes,
but not from the gaze of young memory,

587
00:40:57,171 --> 00:40:58,370
the juvenile breasts.

588
00:40:58,371 --> 00:41:03,371
I had fondled one immortal day and as
if I were the fairy tale nurse of some

589
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:06,170
little princess lost,
kidnapped,

590
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:09,380
discovered in Gypsy rags
through which her naked does.

591
00:41:09,381 --> 00:41:12,980
Smiled at the king and his hounds.
I recognize the tiny,

592
00:41:12,981 --> 00:41:17,981
dark brown mole on her side with all
and delight the king crying for joy.

593
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,300
The trumpets blaring the nurse drunk.

594
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:25,250
I saw again her lovely in drawn abdomen
where my southbound mouth had briefly

595
00:41:25,251 --> 00:41:29,510
paused and those pure aisle hips on
which I had kissed the crenelated imprint

596
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,640
left by the band of her shorts.

597
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:35,720
That last mad day behind the rush rose,

598
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:39,860
the 25 years I have lived since then.

599
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:43,550
Tapered to a palpitating
point and vanished.

600
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:45,530
Yeah.

601
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,450
This is a remarkable passage to me.

602
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,130
He occupies in this passage,

603
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:57,140
every subject position of the fairy tale,
the nurse,

604
00:41:57,141 --> 00:42:00,290
the hounds and the king.
She,

605
00:42:00,291 --> 00:42:03,470
he's the nurse recognizing
the beloved child.

606
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:07,970
He's the king after her and
the hounds really after her.

607
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,320
At the same time,

608
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:17,321
I think we feel the freshmen freshness
of this pros and we feel the humor of it,

609
00:42:18,171 --> 00:42:19,340
the self parody.

610
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:25,450
So even though he's counting on us to be
seduced by the romantic language that,

611
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:32,240
uh,
that incantatory trance of Annabel Lee,

612
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:37,340
there's a certain way in
which it's refreshed for us.

613
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:42,210
Like when he says the 25 years I've
lived since then taper to a pout,

614
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,870
Tate palpitating point and vanished.

615
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:49,340
That is not from the fairy tale.
That's his own voice.

616
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,380
One thing that Nabar cough does,

617
00:42:51,381 --> 00:42:56,381
and I think this is related to the
way words like throb and the layers of

618
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,850
fiction and reality,

619
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:03,950
how these things permeate into different
texts and different layers of the story.

620
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:09,850
He always mixes originality with cliche.

621
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:13,550
He mixes the bad with the good.

622
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,600
He has a real disdain for
the black and the white,

623
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,910
that sense of simplicity

624
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:26,480
and so you're going to find
even at moments where I
think we're meant understand

625
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:30,440
Humberto pros as overwrought.

626
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,220
That muscle bound man
that aim is talks about,

627
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:39,980
you're also going to find
in those passages while
you're being just brought to

628
00:43:39,981 --> 00:43:44,981
the sense of parody just to the edge
of what you can tolerate in that vein,

629
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,450
you're going to get a sharp sentence.

630
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,930
You're going to get a sharp
piece of very original pro style.

631
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,790
This is part of Nebach offs.
Talent is to manipulate you.

632
00:43:55,791 --> 00:44:00,791
This is another way of manipulating you
is to make you see the cliche and then

633
00:44:01,941 --> 00:44:05,030
to draw back from it to
something that surprises you.

634
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,360
So this is part of

635
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:11,170
part of

636
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:14,490
the strategy

637
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:21,070
and then watch what happens to the
pro style. And the difference in tone.

638
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:27,190
I find it most difficult to express with
adequate force that Flash, that shipper,

639
00:44:27,191 --> 00:44:32,191
that impact of passionate recognition
in the course of the sunshot moment that

640
00:44:33,391 --> 00:44:35,670
my glance slithered
over the kneeling child,

641
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:39,060
her eyes blinking over
those stern dark spectacles,

642
00:44:39,061 --> 00:44:43,890
the little hair doctor who was to cure
me of all my aches while I passed by her

643
00:44:43,891 --> 00:44:48,870
in my adult disguise, a great big
handsome hunk of movie land manhood.

644
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:53,070
The vacuum of my soul managed to suck
in every detail of her bright beauty and

645
00:44:53,071 --> 00:44:57,810
these, I checked against the features
of my dead bride a little later.

646
00:44:57,811 --> 00:45:00,270
Of course she this new val,
this Lolita,

647
00:45:00,271 --> 00:45:03,810
my Lolita was to eclipse
completely her prototype.

648
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:08,670
All I want to stress is that my discovery
of her was a fatal consequence of that

649
00:45:08,671 --> 00:45:11,430
Princeton by the sea in my tortured past.

650
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:16,500
And I think there's a reason why there
are quotations around that Princeton by

651
00:45:16,501 --> 00:45:19,650
the sea and why it's
Po a fatal consequence,

652
00:45:19,651 --> 00:45:24,150
not just of his early
love for Annabel Lee,

653
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:26,340
but a consequence of that poetry.

654
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:32,030
This is another kind of defense.
The poetry made me do it.

655
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:39,580
It's the romance that's
being offered in the poetry,

656
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,520
that lens his life,
it's course.

657
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:45,660
Okay.

658
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,580
So here the rationales

659
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:53,700
for his guilt and our forgiveness
of it begin to multiply.

660
00:45:55,170 --> 00:46:00,170
Now I want to draw back from just being
immersed in those details of the text

661
00:46:01,051 --> 00:46:04,110
for a minute to suggest to you that

662
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:10,820
this question of morality is something
that Nebach off deliberately.

663
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:18,590
Courts when to back off
was an exile in Europe.

664
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:23,100
He spent a lot of time
composing chest problems.

665
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,000
These are set setups of pieces on the
chessboard that have particular solutions

666
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:34,740
and they're very complex and they have
a kind of aesthetic form to them and he

667
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:39,630
would aim for certain kinds
of, uh, of elegance in them.

668
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,300
He never wanted to have
an alternate solution.

669
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:45,660
He always wanted to have
a single kind of solution.

670
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:49,040
There are certain themes in chess,
uh,

671
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:54,140
that refer to different kinds of strategic
movements that he would bring out

672
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,900
through these little arrangements and he
would spend inordinate amounts of time

673
00:46:57,901 --> 00:46:58,950
organizing them.

674
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:06,040
Let me read to you how he describes the
action of setting one of these things

675
00:47:06,041 --> 00:47:06,874
up.

676
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:14,150
It should be understood that competition
in chest problems is not really between

677
00:47:14,151 --> 00:47:19,040
white and black, but between the
composer and the hypothetical solver.

678
00:47:19,250 --> 00:47:21,500
Just as in a first rate work of fiction,

679
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:26,270
the real clash is not between the
characters but between the author and the

680
00:47:26,271 --> 00:47:27,104
world.

681
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:32,200
So that a great part of the problem's
is due to the number of tries delusive

682
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:34,510
opening moves,
false sense,

683
00:47:34,511 --> 00:47:39,511
specious lines of play
astutely in lovingly prepared
to lead the would be solver

684
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:40,703
astray.

685
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,950
But whatever I can say about
this matter of problem composing,

686
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:50,130
I do not seem to convey sufficiently
the ecstatic core of the process and its

687
00:47:50,681 --> 00:47:55,180
points of connection with various other
more overt and fruitful operations of

688
00:47:55,181 --> 00:47:59,650
the creative mind from the charging of
dangerous seas to the writing of one of

689
00:47:59,651 --> 00:48:04,651
those incredible novels where the
author in a fit of lucid madness has set

690
00:48:04,871 --> 00:48:09,871
himself certain unique rules that he
observes certain nightmare obstacles that

691
00:48:10,031 --> 00:48:14,560
he surmounts with the zest of a day at
t building a live world from the most

692
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:15,940
unlikely ingredients,

693
00:48:15,941 --> 00:48:20,290
rocks and carbon and blind throbbings

694
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:28,530
Lolita is, I think for an a back
off a kind of chest problem.

695
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:32,880
The chest problem is how can,

696
00:48:34,030 --> 00:48:34,350
okay

697
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:39,020
Navarro cough make us
identify with a pedophile.

698
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:45,530
How can he produce from
these debased ingredients?

699
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,640
What Lionel trilling called it and you
have this blurb on your back cover the

700
00:48:52,881 --> 00:48:55,310
greatest love story of our time.

701
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,613
Oh,

702
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,190
that's a question for you.

703
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,260
Is it the greatest love story
of our time was Lionel trilling,

704
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:09,880
a great mid century literary critic
was he used to do just by Humbert.

705
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,810
What would it mean to be the
greatest love story of our time?

706
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:19,530
But certainly nebach off has in
mind the rhetoric of love stories,

707
00:49:19,931 --> 00:49:21,640
the shape of love stories.

708
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:27,600
And he's using those with all the skill
he can muster to try to make us enter

709
00:49:30,641 --> 00:49:35,641
into the ecstasy that he describes at the
heart of this kind of logical problem,

710
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:43,360
the setting up of this logical problem.
So in a way,

711
00:49:43,361 --> 00:49:46,780
we are the solvers of
this problem for him.

712
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:51,790
We are the other half that
completes the aesthetic experience.

713
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:56,170
We are there to
participate in it with him.

714
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,750
And on the handout that I've given you,

715
00:49:58,751 --> 00:50:01,400
I'm not going to read it now because
we're running out of time. Um,

716
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:05,590
I'd like you to read that at home and
I'm going to refer to it later. Um,

717
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:11,420
the world of imagination on of
the aesthetic is very much, um,

718
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:15,940
on the surface of this text. And, and
you can see it in lots of ways, um,

719
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,870
to just in that little bit of the
first chapter that I read to you,

720
00:50:20,530 --> 00:50:23,890
that sense of fancy, uh, fancy pro style.

721
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:25,810
So you want to think of fancy,

722
00:50:25,811 --> 00:50:29,510
not just as a sort a
feminine ornamentation,

723
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:34,550
but as that older fashioned
sense of the word, the fancy,

724
00:50:34,551 --> 00:50:35,660
the imagination.

725
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,360
So imagination is a
privileged realm for Novakof,

726
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,880
and it is around, that,
always has about it,

727
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:48,140
that golden glow. And if as you read, um,

728
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:49,490
as you read Lolita,

729
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,760
try to notice how much light imagery
there is for Nobach off sunlight,

730
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:59,920
golden Anness, all those
midges, the golden midges,

731
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:04,280
the downy golden hair on the Litas limbs,
her Tawney skin,

732
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:09,490
all that golden menace is very much of
a piece with the world of imagination.

733
00:51:10,191 --> 00:51:14,960
So it's as if imagination makes everything
glitter and its color is that have

734
00:51:14,961 --> 00:51:18,290
the most aesthetic of metals of gold.

735
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:22,130
So keep these things in mind as you read.

736
00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:27,320
And in the next couple of lectures
you'll see more of the development of,

737
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:29,990
of argument about the book.
But I hope this gets you started.
