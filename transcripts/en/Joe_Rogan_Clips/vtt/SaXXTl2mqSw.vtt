1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.940
Is it our community that don't have healthcare?
I know I've,
I've,

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.460
I didn't have healthcare forever.
Go.
Yeah,

3
00:00:07.461 --> 00:00:10.670
I got it a week ago and I booked all the appointments.
Did you?
Everything.

4
00:00:10.671 --> 00:00:12.980
I got the kitty cat checked,
got the teeth checked.

5
00:00:12.981 --> 00:00:15.350
[inaudible] eyes were you worry about the TT.
You ever,

6
00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:18.710
if you have the feeling like you have a cavity,
like a phantom cavity,
like shit,

7
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.550
I lost my tooth hurt.
Talk about fucking cavity.
I definitely did.

8
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.610
My teeth were like crevasses.
O j a bunch of cab.
Yeah,

9
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:29.490
she filled me like four times cause I haven't been because healthcare is

10
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:33.510
ridiculous.
No,
I wasn't eating candy.
You got all these holes in your face.

11
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.150
I don't know.
I think like,
you know,
changes in my life.

12
00:00:36.151 --> 00:00:39.030
Maybe I got ringworm from you change

13
00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.470
two changes.
Yeah.
Little kids get it all the time.

14
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.410
They do.
Oh dude to they're rolling in dirt.
I'm going to blow you away.

15
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.610
Blow your mind away.
Okay.

16
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.880
Hookworm is super common in the south and it literally diminishes your capacity

17
00:00:57.511 --> 00:00:58.344
for thinking.

18
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.590
So like the idea of like to slack jawed southern dumb person Theo.

19
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.150
No,
no,
I'm sorry.
I didn't know she was going to do that.

20
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.570
I would never have her on Joe.
You know,
I love you.
I love you feel no not,

21
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.450
but maybe people feel knows relative.

22
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.540
If you had to say the field gone voice like maybe a few people that I know.
Yes.

23
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.950
Yeah.
There were all hookworm uh,
victims.
What,

24
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:30.030
so how do you get hookworm walking around barefoot?
I mean,

25
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.110
there's just too many opportunities to get these worms in your body.
Oh,
for sure.

26
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.370
That's so gross.

27
00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:39.210
When you see dudes who go to like some foreign country and they get scratched

28
00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:41.880
and they come back in a Bot,
flies clone other ED and their belly.

29
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.420
Yeah.

30
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.570
A kid just died recently in India,

31
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.890
I think it was India.
He got a infection.

32
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.950
He was having headaches and it turns out worms from pig feces had,

33
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.300
they made it all the way up into his brain and they were making cysts all

34
00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:05.720
throughout his brain.
Yeah.

35
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.170
Shortly thereafter it they said there was so bad they couldn't even give him

36
00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:13.020
deworming medication because if they did,

37
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:15.270
they were worried his brain would start bleeding.

38
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.140
And then you know it would suffer from a stroke.
What?

39
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.260
I am not going to sleep tonight all as warm talk.

40
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.600
What is the [inaudible] to cirrhosis?

41
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.170
Pull those pictures out to find the pictures.
Yeah,
pictures of the dudes brain.

42
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.400
It's just like filled with sis.
Oh God.
Why are we looking at,

43
00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.550
cause we're high and it's like 10 in the morning.

44
00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.810
Oh you know what I was saying before I forgot to bring my fanny pack.
You.

45
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.120
You gave me one of your fanny packs and I travel with it everywhere.

46
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.090
Thank you very much.
I'm glad you enjoy it.
Trying to spread the word source.

47
00:02:46.091 --> 00:02:49.730
Whole thing ever.
This is my fanny pack.
I know I can wear this for middle.

48
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.810
Same One.
A couple people have talked some shit and I was like,

49
00:02:52.811 --> 00:02:57.190
you better step back,
step back,
step back.
I've got my pharmacy in there.

50
00:02:57.191 --> 00:03:01.030
I've got my whole thing so I can be a doctor.
The road,
you have a stethoscope.

51
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.580
I got a scalpel.
What's up?

52
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.780
<v 1>He,
he complained of having pain in his groin and swelling in his eye,</v>

53
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.240
and then they found out he had cysts all over his brain.

54
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.640
<v 0>I mean,
I have pain in my groin every week,
but</v>

55
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.830
look at his brain on the right,
I'm assuming as a result,

56
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.170
both of them as different views of both different views.

57
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:24.200
Those little holes are all cysts inside of bronc.
Yeah.

58
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.080
He's brain is literally imploding.
Although those little spots,

59
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.650
those little white spots,
those are all little cysts inside his brain.

60
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.520
That must've been painful.
Fucking pure agony.
It must be pure agony.

61
00:03:37.521 --> 00:03:41.680
This was in India,
you said?
What country,
man?
Most of India.
Yeah.

62
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.170
Yeah.
Aw,
fuck that in.
Just imagine like people having,

63
00:03:47.171 --> 00:03:49.300
not the access to healthcare in this country,

64
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.720
but at least we're a little bit modernized.

65
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.020
Being in one of those countries and being poor.
You're fucked.

66
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.090
You're so fucked.

67
00:03:58.091 --> 00:04:01.870
By swallowing microscopic eggs passed in the feces of a person who has

68
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:06.610
intestinal pork.
Tapeworm I never go to brunch again,
but think about that.

69
00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:09.280
It's not even just pork tapeworm.

70
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.260
It's the eggs in the shit of a person who has the tape.

71
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:16.000
Did you see what God,

72
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.360
Jesus Christ Holy Hell is get in your mouth and shit.

73
00:04:19.361 --> 00:04:22.850
I smoked a joint before this shit.
I am in a pure panic attack.

74
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.860
Don't eat ass in India unless that person is not anti tape worm medication.

75
00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.850
Also never eat ass again.
I mean this is a PSA for antiacid eating.
It is.

76
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.750
I told you I had a cool I a few weeks ago.
That was my life will be Saint Jamie

77
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.650
<v 1>the,
there's been a change in the way that the pork industry is going to be doing</v>

78
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:44.620
inspections that the government's going to stop doing it apparently as of like

79
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:47.530
early May and the industry is now taking over.

80
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.030
<v 0>Oh,
that'll be,
that's a terrible idea here.</v>

81
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.300
It's just that's exactly what you want.

82
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.560
This is one of those things where people that are all in favor of deregulating

83
00:04:56.561 --> 00:05:01.240
everything.
You need to understand this shit like this happens.

84
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.810
If these people cut corners and we know people have cut corners before and maybe

85
00:05:04.811 --> 00:05:07.000
it's not all of them.
Maybe most of them are going to be great.

86
00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.840
People are going to die or get sick.
They're going to get ECO law.

87
00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:12.460
They're going to get all sorts of fucked up things,

88
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:15.730
40% and replacing them with employees,

89
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.690
cutting the number of federal inspectors by about 40% that is such a bad idea.

90
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.400
It looks like America and everywhere is going to get a whole bunch of hookworms.

91
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.710
This is like having the mafia police,
the streets taking away.

92
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.630
There'll be no limits on slaughter line speeds.
Oh,
that is so gross.

93
00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.890
No one's trying to make it quick.
