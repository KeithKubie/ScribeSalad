00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:04.513
Being in a hospital, that fact alone, increases your

00:00:04.513 --> 00:00:08.713
probability of dying by a factor 40 is a causal

00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:12.782
statement. It says the hospital causes you to die.

00:00:12.782 --> 00:00:15.954
Not just it coincides with the fact that you die

00:00:15.954 --> 00:00:19.059
and very frequently people in the public get

00:00:19.059 --> 00:00:22.167
this wrong. People observe there is a correlation

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:25.359
but they suggest the correlation is causal in

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.530
attempting to make you understand the statistic

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.686
as a call of action. Now, to understand why

00:00:31.686 --> 00:00:33.781
this could be wrong letâ€™s dive in a little bit

00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:36.000
deeper into the same example
