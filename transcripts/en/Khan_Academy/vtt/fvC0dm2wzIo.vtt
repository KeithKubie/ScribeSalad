00:00:00.653 --> 00:00:01.433
Voiceover:Right over here,

00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:03.833
I have the graph of f of x,

00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:05.633
and what I want to think
about in this video

00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:08.233
is whether we could
have sketched this graph

00:00:08.233 --> 00:00:11.703
just by looking at the
definition of our function,

00:00:11.703 --> 00:00:15.566
which is defined as a rational expression.

00:00:15.566 --> 00:00:20.566
We have 2x plus 10 over 5x minus 15.

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.900
There is a couple of ways to do this.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.433
First, you might just want to pick out

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:26.700
any numbers that are
really easy to calculate.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.567
For example, what happens
when X is equal to 0?

00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:33.684
We could say f of 0 is
going to be equal to,

00:00:33.684 --> 00:00:35.689
well, all the x term is going to be 0,

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:38.367
so you're going to be left
with 10 over negative 15,

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:40.366
which is negative 10/15,

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:42.971
which is negative 2/3.

00:00:42.971 --> 00:00:44.100
You can plot that one.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.433
x equals 0.

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:49.166
f of x or y equals f of x is negative 2/3,

00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:50.833
and we see that point,

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:52.501
let me do that in a darker color,

00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:53.967
you see that point right over there,

00:00:53.967 --> 00:00:55.766
so we could have plotted that point.

00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:58.634
We could also say, "When
does this function equal 0?"

00:00:58.634 --> 00:01:01.302
Well, the function is equal to 0 when ...

00:01:01.302 --> 00:01:02.633
The only way to get
the function equal to 0

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:04.845
is if you get this numerator equal to 0,

00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:09.366
so you could try to solve
2x plus 10 is equal to 0.

00:01:09.366 --> 00:01:12.166
That's going to happen when
2x is equal to negative 10.

00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:14.300
I just subtracted 10 from both sides.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.233
If I divide both sides by 2,

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:19.366
that's going to happen when
x is equal to negative 5.

00:01:19.366 --> 00:01:23.300
You see that, you see
this right over here.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.966
When x is equal to negative 5,

00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:28.102
the function intersects the x-axis.

00:01:28.102 --> 00:01:28.902
That's just two points,

00:01:28.902 --> 00:01:30.300
but that still doesn't give us enough

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.241
to really form this
interesting shape over here.

00:01:33.241 --> 00:01:34.434
You could think about what other functions

00:01:34.434 --> 00:01:37.433
have this type of shape.

00:01:37.433 --> 00:01:39.711
Now what I want to think
about is the behavior

00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:42.492
of the function at different points.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.967
First, I want to think
about when this function

00:01:45.967 --> 00:01:49.509
is undefined and what type
of behavior we might expect

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.033
for that function when it's undefined.

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:53.966
This function is going to be undefined.

00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:55.433
The only way I can think
of to make this undefined

00:01:55.433 --> 00:01:57.500
is if I make the denominator equal to 0.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.100
We don't know what it
means to divide by 0.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.833
That is undefined.

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:02.300
The function is going to be undefined

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.503
when 5x,

00:02:04.042 --> 00:02:05.434
let me do this in blue,

00:02:05.434 --> 00:02:08.900
when 5x minus 15 is equal to 0,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.437
or adding 15 to both sides,

00:02:10.437 --> 00:02:12.034
when 5x is equal to 15,

00:02:12.034 --> 00:02:13.974
or dividing both sides by 5,

00:02:13.974 --> 00:02:16.039
when x is equal to 3,

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:20.066
f is undefined.

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.966
Now, there is a couple of ways

00:02:21.966 --> 00:02:24.834
for a function to be undefined at a point.

00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:26.700
You could have something like this.

00:02:27.023 --> 00:02:29.761
Let me draw some axes right over here.

00:02:29.976 --> 00:02:32.100
Let's say that this is 3.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.033
You could have your function,
it could look like this.

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:35.633
It could be defined.

00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:38.833
It might approach something
but just not be defined

00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:41.700
right at 3 and then just
keep on going like that,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.700
or the other possibility is it might have

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.840
a vertical asymptote there.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.900
If it has a vertical asymptote,

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.700
it's going to look something like this.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.567
It might be approach, it
might just pop up to infinity,

00:02:55.567 --> 00:02:57.968
and it might pop down from
infinity on this side,

00:02:57.968 --> 00:03:02.368
or it might go from negative
infinity right over here.

00:03:02.368 --> 00:03:05.233
That's what a vertical
asymptote would look like,

00:03:05.233 --> 00:03:06.767
that as we approach from the left,

00:03:06.767 --> 00:03:09.700
the graph is approaching a vertical,

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.833
but it never quite gets to x equals 3,

00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:13.767
I guess one way we could say it,

00:03:13.767 --> 00:03:16.501
or the function is not
defined at x equals 3.

00:03:16.501 --> 00:03:18.167
As you approach from the
right, the same thing,

00:03:18.167 --> 00:03:20.500
the function just, in
this case, drops down.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.372
It almost becomes vertical.

00:03:22.372 --> 00:03:24.501
It's approaching negative infinity

00:03:24.501 --> 00:03:27.567
as x approaches 3 from
the positive direction.

00:03:27.567 --> 00:03:28.767
So how would we know?

00:03:28.767 --> 00:03:30.300
Obviously, when you look at here,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.033
when we know the graph ahead of time,

00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:33.300
and if you say, "OK, this is easy."

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.369
This is x equals 10.

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:36.033
Let's see how many.

00:03:36.033 --> 00:03:38.767
This is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,

00:03:38.767 --> 00:03:39.833
so each of these are 2,

00:03:39.833 --> 00:03:42.185
so x equals 3 is right over here.

00:03:42.185 --> 00:03:43.100
When you look at the graph,

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.433
if you had the graph in front of you,

00:03:44.433 --> 00:03:45.233
you would see,

00:03:45.233 --> 00:03:48.769
"Oh, look, this is indeed
a vertical asymptote."

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:49.767
Just looking at the graph,

00:03:49.767 --> 00:03:53.567
you see that you have a vertical
asymptote at x equals 3,

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:55.100
and let me write that down,

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.669
vertical asymptote,

00:03:57.084 --> 00:04:00.758
vertical asymptote,

00:04:00.994 --> 00:04:04.017
asymptote at x equals 3,

00:04:04.017 --> 00:04:05.569
at x equals 3,

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.711
but how would you have known that?

00:04:07.711 --> 00:04:09.167
How would you have known that

00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:11.166
if you didn't have the graph here,

00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:12.500
if you just had this?

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.700
We know it's not defined at 3,

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.992
but how do we know it's
not a point discontinuity

00:04:15.992 --> 00:04:19.553
and not instead a vertical asymptote?

00:04:20.034 --> 00:04:21.900
There's a couple of ways to do it.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.233
One way is you could try values near 3

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:26.434
and see what happens.

00:04:26.434 --> 00:04:28.833
For example, you could
get your calculator out,

00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:33.833
and you could try, let's say, 3.01.

00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:40.033
If you say 2 times 3.01 plus 10,

00:04:40.033 --> 00:04:41.700
actually, oh, that's the numerator,

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.433
and then I'm going to divide that,

00:04:43.433 --> 00:04:49.967
the numerator, by 5 times 3.01 minus 15.

00:04:49.967 --> 00:04:53.033
It gets us a fairly large number.

00:04:53.033 --> 00:04:54.967
It's exploding on us.

00:04:54.967 --> 00:05:02.434
If we got even closer, so
if we did 2 times 3.001,

00:05:02.434 --> 00:05:12.241
plus 10 divided by 5 times 3.001,

00:05:12.241 --> 00:05:18.800
now I'm trying x is
equal to 3.001 minus 15,

00:05:21.033 --> 00:05:23.366
we see we get even a larger number.

00:05:23.366 --> 00:05:25.834
As x gets closer and closer to 3,

00:05:25.834 --> 00:05:27.900
f of x seems to be exploding.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.371
It seems to be approaching
positive infinity.

00:05:30.371 --> 00:05:33.100
That's one way to say,
OK, this looks like,

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.307
at least from this side,
we are approaching,

00:05:35.307 --> 00:05:37.034
we are approaching positive infinity,

00:05:37.034 --> 00:05:41.033
so we would have been able
to draw something like that,

00:05:41.033 --> 00:05:43.100
and then you could have
tried values below.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.567
You could have tried values below,

00:05:44.567 --> 00:05:46.167
so you could have said ...

00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:50.500
Actually, let me just
put the last entry here,

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.100
and let me just change
the 3.001s to 2.999,

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:57.566
2.999,

00:05:57.566 --> 00:06:01.438
and whoops, let me go over here.

00:06:01.438 --> 00:06:06.300
We have 2.999, and we get ...

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.166
We're going really negative now.

00:06:08.166 --> 00:06:09.833
We're approaching negative infinity.

00:06:09.833 --> 00:06:10.900
If you just tried that out,

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.703
that would give you a
pretty good indication

00:06:12.703 --> 00:06:14.530
that the graph is looking
something like that

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:15.635
right over here,

00:06:15.635 --> 00:06:17.966
which also seems to match
connecting these two points

00:06:17.966 --> 00:06:20.035
that we've already thought about.

00:06:20.035 --> 00:06:21.379
But now let's see what's going on

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:23.523
as x approaches really large values

00:06:23.523 --> 00:06:26.886
or really positive values
or really negative values.

00:06:27.004 --> 00:06:30.700
It looks like there is a
horizontal asymptote here.

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.807
Just looking at the graph,

00:06:33.653 --> 00:06:34.967
it seems like there is some value

00:06:34.967 --> 00:06:37.263
that as x approaches really large values,

00:06:37.263 --> 00:06:38.566
really positive values,

00:06:38.566 --> 00:06:40.900
f of x is going to be
approaching that value,

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.833
that asymptote from above.

00:06:42.833 --> 00:06:44.166
As x becomes really negative,

00:06:44.166 --> 00:06:47.033
it looks like f of x is
approaching that from below.

00:06:47.033 --> 00:06:48.700
But how would we be
able to figure that out

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.566
just by looking at this?

00:06:50.566 --> 00:06:52.433
One thought experiment is just to say

00:06:52.433 --> 00:06:56.174
what happens to f of x
as x approaches infinity?

00:06:56.174 --> 00:06:57.633
Let me write that down.

00:06:57.633 --> 00:07:01.702
As x approaches infinity,

00:07:01.702 --> 00:07:06.433
then f of x is going to approach what?

00:07:06.433 --> 00:07:09.501
As x approaches larger and larger values,

00:07:09.501 --> 00:07:11.648
the positive 10 and the negative 15

00:07:11.648 --> 00:07:13.033
start to matter a lot less.

00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:14.101
At the highest degree term,

00:07:14.101 --> 00:07:16.708
the numerator and denominator
start to dominate.

00:07:16.708 --> 00:07:18.966
We could say as x approaches infinity,

00:07:18.966 --> 00:07:25.033
f of x is getting closer
and closer to 2x over 5x,

00:07:25.033 --> 00:07:28.566
which is 2/5,

00:07:28.566 --> 00:07:30.300
which is equal to 2/5.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.437
You could say f of x is approaching 2/5.

00:07:33.437 --> 00:07:38.542
If you really want to see that
a little bit more concretely,

00:07:38.612 --> 00:07:42.100
let's imagine different values for x,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.766
as x gets larger and larger and larger.

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:47.133
If we have,

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.032
so x, f of x.

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:54.934
If x is 1, then f of x is
just going to be 2 plus 10

00:07:54.934 --> 00:07:57.767
over 5 minus 15.

00:07:57.767 --> 00:08:01.212
Here, the 10 and the
subtracting the 15 matter a lot.

00:08:01.367 --> 00:08:03.908
But if x were 1,000,

00:08:03.908 --> 00:08:10.903
then f of x would be 2,000
plus 10 over 5,000 minus 15.

00:08:10.903 --> 00:08:15.100
Now, the 2,000 and 5,000 are
really setting the agenda.

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.302
Then if x were, let's say, 1 million,

00:08:19.649 --> 00:08:21.034
1 million,

00:08:21.233 --> 00:08:23.527
and I just use blue for more contrast,

00:08:23.527 --> 00:08:25.600
then f of x would be 2 million,

00:08:26.036 --> 00:08:28.033
2 million plus 10,

00:08:28.033 --> 00:08:29.710
let me move over to
the right a little bit,

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:36.166
2 million plus 10 over 5 million minus 15.

00:08:36.166 --> 00:08:38.900
Here, the 10 and the 15
are almost inconsequential.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.700
You can imagine if x were a
billion or a trillion or a google,

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.436
then the 10 and the
negative 15 start to matter

00:08:45.436 --> 00:08:47.300
a lot and lot less.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.169
As x approaches infinity,
these matter less.

00:08:51.169 --> 00:08:54.633
The highest degree terms matter,

00:08:54.633 --> 00:08:57.366
so f of x is going to approach 2x over 5x,

00:08:57.366 --> 00:08:58.766
which is 2/5.

00:08:58.766 --> 00:09:01.119
So f of x is approaching 2/5,

00:09:01.119 --> 00:09:02.566
and that's what this line looks like.

00:09:02.566 --> 00:09:05.494
2/5 is same thing as 0.4, so f of x,

00:09:05.494 --> 00:09:07.504
and we see that in the graph.

00:09:07.504 --> 00:09:09.367
f of x is approaching that,

00:09:09.367 --> 00:09:11.367
but it's not quite getting close to it.

00:09:11.367 --> 00:09:12.967
It's not quite getting there.

00:09:12.967 --> 00:09:15.167
It's getting closer and closer
to it as x goes to infinity,

00:09:15.167 --> 00:09:16.633
but it's not quite getting there

00:09:16.633 --> 00:09:18.100
because you're always going to have

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.699
that plus 10 and that minus 15 there,

00:09:20.699 --> 00:09:23.267
so you're never going
to be exactly at 2/5.

00:09:23.503 --> 00:09:24.566
The same thing is happening

00:09:24.566 --> 00:09:27.900
as x gets more and more and more negative.

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.267
You can make all of these negative values.

00:09:30.371 --> 00:09:33.108
If this were negative 1,

00:09:33.108 --> 00:09:34.766
that would be negative 2, negative 5.

00:09:34.766 --> 00:09:35.787
If this were negative 1,000,

00:09:35.787 --> 00:09:37.924
it would be negative
2,000 over negative 5,000.

00:09:37.924 --> 00:09:38.901
If it's negative 1 million,

00:09:38.901 --> 00:09:42.181
it would be negative 2 million
over negative 5 million.

00:09:42.181 --> 00:09:43.968
But you see, even in this case,

00:09:43.968 --> 00:09:49.101
f of x is approaching 2x over
5x, which is approaching 2/5,

00:09:49.101 --> 00:09:51.433
or you could say it's approaching
negative 2 over negative 5

00:09:51.433 --> 00:09:55.804
which is still 2/5, and you
see that right over here.

00:09:55.962 --> 00:09:59.734
We would say that this function
has a horizontal asymptote,

00:10:00.022 --> 00:10:05.466
horizontal asymptote,

00:10:07.972 --> 00:10:11.576
at y equals a horizontal
line right over here,

00:10:11.576 --> 00:10:14.600
y is equal to 2/5.

00:10:15.007 --> 00:10:16.968
Hopefully, this graph here
is helping us appreciate

00:10:16.968 --> 00:10:19.166
what these vertical and
horizontal asymptotes

00:10:19.166 --> 00:10:20.500
actually are.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.700
But if we didn't have the graph,

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.652
we could have said, OK, we're undefined

00:10:23.652 --> 00:10:24.700
at x equals 3.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.377
We could test some values around it,

00:10:26.377 --> 00:10:27.272
and so we could say, OK, look,

00:10:27.272 --> 00:10:29.501
it does look like we're
approaching negative infinity

00:10:29.501 --> 00:10:32.967
as x approaches negative 3 from the left.

00:10:32.967 --> 00:10:34.833
It looks like we're
approaching positive infinity

00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:36.969
as x approaches negative 3 from the right,

00:10:36.969 --> 00:10:40.633
so we could draw that
blue point right there.

00:10:40.633 --> 00:10:41.966
We could graph these two points,

00:10:41.966 --> 00:10:43.264
when does f equal 0,

00:10:43.264 --> 00:10:45.713
What happens to f when x equals 0,

00:10:45.713 --> 00:10:47.655
and then we could think about the behavior

00:10:47.655 --> 00:10:50.834
as x approaches infinity
or negative infinity,

00:10:50.834 --> 00:10:54.700
as x approaches infinity
or negative infinity,

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:56.667
and draw this horizontal asymptote.

00:10:56.766 --> 00:10:58.101
Between all of those,

00:10:58.101 --> 00:11:00.033
that would have been a pretty good way

00:11:00.033 --> 23:59:59.999
to be able to sketch this actual graph.
