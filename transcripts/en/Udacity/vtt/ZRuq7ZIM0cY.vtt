00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Norvig] The answer is no, I didn't try to confuse you.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In fact, I'm trying to show you a very useful tool in generator expressions.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Yes, I thought the indentation was important.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
With all those fors and ifs, I would have run out of space across the page.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Yes, I wanted to stop early, and so a list comprehension would have been a bad idea

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
because a list comprehension would have had to do all the work,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
whereas a generator expression can stop as soon as it's done.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Having statements rather than expressions also would allow me to stop early.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And yes, it's easier to edit.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If I wanted to move around the order of the clauses,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
instead of having the indented structure that I would have with statements

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I have a flat structure and it's easy for me to pick out 1 of the constraints

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and move it somewhere else in the list

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
without having to worry about getting the indentation right.

00:00:50.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So editing expressions is easier than editing statements in Python.
