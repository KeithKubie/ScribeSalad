00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.569
Ladies, have you ever felt tired, easily frustrated,
and prone to feeling low?

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:07.119
Maybe it’s just your birth control.

00:00:07.119 --> 00:00:12.730
Hey guys, Julia here for DNews

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.470
The pill is over 60 years old!

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.369
It was a revolution, it allowed women to take
full control of their reproductive health.

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.320
And since then, it’s been studied a whole
bunch, and we’ve talked about it before

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.320
on the show.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.449
Check some links for those episodes down below.

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.599
Some women suffer from a form of PMS so severe
it affects work, family, life, etc, called

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.730
PreMenstrual Dysphoric Disorder or PMDD.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.150
For some of these women a prescription of
birth control makes symptoms easier to manage.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.320
On the other hand, birth control gets a bad
rap.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.460
While many women report no adverse side effects,
some say the pill makes them MORE moody and

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.460
depressed.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.460
So who is right?

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.290
Well, a recent study published in the Journal
of Human Brain Mapping found that oral birth

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.720
control has a strange way of affect a woman’s
brain.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.620
Neuroscientists from UCLA compared some women
who take oral contraceptives, or OC, and some

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.610
“naturally-cycling” women who don’t.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.690
They found that women who take OC had lower
cortical thickness in the lateral orbitofrontal

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.510
cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.970
The researchers say that these parts of the
brain are related to processing rewards and

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.620
other things like incoming stimuli.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.380
But more research is needed to see if these
changes are related to a change in behavior.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.380
Although, the lead author of that study told
the Huffington Post that those changes in

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.090
the brain might be responsible for some of
the negative feelings some women get when

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.460
starting the pill, like anxiety and depression.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.010
But these results are a stark contrast to
some found in a 2010 study.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:36.550
That study published in the journal Brain
Research also compared women on the pill and

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.940
“naturally-cycling” women.

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.890
The researchers found that some women on birth
control had more grey matter in some areas

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.310
of the brain responsible for emotional regulation,
memory and learning.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.750
You’d think that would make women less moody,
right?

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.080
What’s going on?

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.400
One review published in the journal Frontiers
of Neuroscience, found that there are at least

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.830
two groups of women who respond differently
to birth control pills.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.909
Some really do seem to be more emotionally
stable on the pill while others have increased

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.479
rates of depression, anxiety, fatigue, neurotic
symptoms, compulsion and anger.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.569
The researchers found that in some studies
elevated levels of estradiol, a derivative

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.959
of which is a major component in OC,
might have antidepressant properties.

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.680
But they also found that it can lower the
body’s production of estradiol, which might

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.810
lower moods.

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.900
That same review also found that progesterone
-- the other major component of combination

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.060
OC -- might elevate moods at low concentrations
but maybe lower moods at higher concentrations.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.040
It really depends on what kind of birth control
you’re on and what levels of hormones those

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.240
pills contain.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.620
One meta-analysis published in the Journal
of Affective Disorders found that for most

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.880
women, OC affect on mood is a positive one.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.270
Yet there is a sub-group who may experience
the opposite.

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.920
So while birth control does allow women to
take control over their reproductive choices,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.220
it’s also a very personal decision and seems
the effects are personal too.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.400
In fact, the pill can even affect who you
fancy too.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:18.240
