00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.120
Now if you want to build a use case diagram for

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.520
our example, we have to add the use cases for

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.710
these different actors. For instance, if we consider the student

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.810
and the registrar, they might be both interacting with the maintain

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.950
schedule system, the registrar by updating the schedule and the

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.125
students by using the schedule that has been updated by the

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:20.860
registrar. As you can see, different roles for the same

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.962
use case. Another possible use case is the request course roster.

00:00:24.962 --> 00:00:28.520
And on this case, the professor will request the roster

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.960
by interacting with the system. We will continue in this way

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.270
by further refining and by further adding use cases as we

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.240
identify possible interactions of the actors that we identified with our

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.380
system. So in summary, what the use case diagram is doing

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.370
is to show the actors and their interaction with the system

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.680
through a set of use cases. At this point, it should

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.990
be pretty clear that sure, this gives us an idea of

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.630
the interactions but we don't really know how these interactions occur.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.870
So there is one piece that is missing, which is how

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.850
do we document the use cases, how do we describe what

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.010
happens and what these interactions actually are. And that's exactly what

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.410
we're going to discuss now, how to document use cases. So the

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.000
behavior of a use case can be specified by describing its

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.650
flow of events. And it is important to note that the

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.190
flow of events should be described from an actor's point of view,

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.690
so from the point of view of the external entity that

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.070
is interacting with my system. So the description should detail what

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.480
the system must provide to the actor when the use case

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.170
is executed. In particular, it should describe how the use case

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.670
starts and ends. It should describe the normal flow of events,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.280
what is the normal interaction. And in addition to the normal

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.720
flow of events, it should also describe possibly alternative flows of

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.240
events. For example, in the case in which there are multiple

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.450
ways of accomplishing one action or performing a task. And finally,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.880
it should also describe exceptional flow of events. For example, assume that

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.910
you are describing a use case for withdrawing money from an

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.230
ATM. You may want to describe the normal flow of events in which

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.590
I insert my card, I provide my pin and so on.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.750
An alternative one in which, in addition to withdrawing cash, maybe I'll

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.550
also first ask for some information about how much money is

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.390
in my account. And finally, I may want to also describe an exceptional

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.900
flow of events in which I get my pin wrong and,

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.140
therefore, I'm not able to perform the operation. One more thing I

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.140
want to mention, when we talk about documenting use cases, is

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.770
the fact that the description of this information can be provided in

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.650
two main ways, in an informal way or in a formal

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.330
way. In the case of an informal description, we could just have

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.540
a textual description of the flow of events in natural language.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.250
In the case of a formal or structured description, we may use,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.610
for example, pre and post conditions, pseudo

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.680
code to indicate the steps. We could

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.010
also use the sequence diagrams, which is something that we will see in a minute.
