morning, good morning.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.546
Welcome, welcome to the
National Book Festival.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.270
I'm John Cole.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.026
I'm the director of the Center for
the Book in the Library of Congress.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.580
And it's my -- thank you, thank you.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:22.750
[ Applause ]

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.350
&gt;&gt; John Cole: It is my
pleasure to scream at you.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.510
[ Ringing ]

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.130
&gt;&gt; John Cole: That was a joke.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.463
You can hear me now.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.530
We're very pleased to have you here.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.440
This is the 10th year of
the National Book Festival.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.296
We know you're going to have
a wonderful day here today.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.076
I want you to know that today,
that our one-hour performance here

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.670
about the Exquisite Corpse
Adventure is being filmed

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.183
for the Library's Web
site and for the archives,

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.313
and you'll have a chance to I hope,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.800
ask some questions
and also participate.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:06.776
And we want you to be mindful of
the fact that we have camera risers

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:09.690
in the back that cannot be tampered
with, or please don't sit on them.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.610
And also, be careful when you speak,

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.740
you are going to be
recorded as well.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.660
But we think you'll enjoy it
and you'll enjoy the experience.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.780
What I have here to demonstrate is
the Exquisite Corpse new poster,

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.956
which is available in the back.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:32.193
We hope everyone will
take it and remember

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.253
that this is a very
wonderful adventure story

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.746
that graphically is
going to be demonstrated

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.516
by our two artists today.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.973
And also you're in for a real treat,
because towards the end of this,

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.106
you're going to see episode
number 27, which was written

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.696
by our Young People's National
Ambassador, Katherine Paterson,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.543
and it will be a very
special treat for all of you.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.510
[ Applause ]

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.106
&gt;&gt; John Cole: I want
to begin by recognizing

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.653
that this is the 10th
year of the partnership

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.030
between the National Children's
Book and Literacy Alliance

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.636
and the Center for the Book.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:18.286
And it has been a fruitful
10-year partnership,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.830
which has brought us not only
the Exquisite Corpse Adventure,

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.320
but this wonderful group of writers
that are going to be introduced

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.166
to you by Mary Brigid Barrett, who
is the President and the Founder,

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.470
and with Katherine
Paterson, a leading life

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:35.313
in the National Children's
Book and Literacy Alliance.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.533
I'm pleased to turn this
over to Mary Brigid.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.560
Mary Brigid?

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.253
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: Thank you, John.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000


00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.060
[ Applause ]

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.716
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: Good
morning, Washington.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.716
I am Mary Brigid Barrett,
and I'm the President

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.133
of the National Children's
Book and Literacy Alliance.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.960
And on behalf of the NCBLA Board
of Authors and Illustrators,

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.873
I welcome you to the
Exquisite Corpse Adventure.

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.773
And we'd like to thank
Dr. Billington, Dr. Cole,

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.530
and the incredibly dedicated
staff of the Library of Congress

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.470
for inviting us to be here today.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.556
Yeah, that's great.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.740
I have a little housekeeping detail.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.013
Everybody should have a program.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:31.113
If you don't have a
program, raise your hand.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:34.816
And there's going to be a reason
that you need the program,

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.383
so volunteers are going to --

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.760
keep your hands up 'til a
volunteer gets you a program.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.753
And in this program, you're going
to find all kinds of information

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.320
about the Exquisite
Corpse Adventure,

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.066
what a progressive story is.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.890
And there's information
about our amazing cast

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.456
of authors and illustrators.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.190
And also there is a schedule
in the back that tells you

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.290
when our authors will be doing
their individual presentations

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:05.330
later today.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.596
As John -- I don't know,
John didn't mention this,

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.463
but the Exquisite Corpse Adventure
has been read all year round

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.240
by literally thousands
of students and kids

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.540
around the United States
and around the world.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.516
We have readers from
South Africa and Japan.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:26.130
We have readers for
the Exquisite Corpse

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.050
that are reading the story
on Read.gov in Europe.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.356
So it's been very exciting for us.

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.920
And on top of that,
teachers and librarians

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.593
and parents are using the
Exquisite Corpse with all

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.863
of the educational materials, and
they're getting the young people

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.443
in their lives reading more
and writing themselves,

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.363
which we think is really important.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:51.363
So it's our deepest hope today
that this presentation inspires all

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.303
of you -- kids, moms,
dads and teachers --

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.526
to read the Exquisite Corpse if you
haven't read it on Read.gov yet,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.733
and play the progressive
story game yourself.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.163
You know, at home when you're
all wrapped up in the blankets

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:06.346
in winter, you can
share stories together

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.450
on those really long car trips when
you're about to kill each other

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.930
in the car -- that's when you want
to share those stories together.

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.536
And it's important to
write your own stories

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.830
and share them with people you love.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.256
And I am really pleased
to announce today

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.080
that the Exquisite Corps Adventure
is going to be made into a book.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.693
And it will be published
next fall by Candle of Press,

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.606
right in time for next
year's book festival.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.850


00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.623
And all of our authors
on stage, coincidentally,

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.896
are also contributors to
this incredible anthology

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.870
that the NCBLA put together

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.386
about our White House connecting
literacy to historical literacy.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.220
It's won every award
imaginable in the last year,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.496
and it has a brand new piece
at the end of it written

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.703
by poet Nikki Grimes about
her experience coming

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:00.093
to the historic inauguration
of President Obama,

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:03.896
which is the new edition
that updates the book,

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.290
the new piece that updates the book.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.553
So make sure that you find this.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.306
And when our authors are
illustrating between noon

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.066
and 1 o'clock, they have
also very graciously said

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:16.703
that they will sign copies of
our White House, if you want them

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.250
to sign that besides
their own terrific books.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.956
Now, those programs that you all
have, open them up to the inside

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.836
and if you have a red
star inside your program,

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.273
you have just won your own
copy of our White House,

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.826
Looking in Looking out,
and where are the books --

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.133
are over there in the corner.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.390
If you will take your program.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.923
At the end of the presentation,
you take your program,

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.120
and you will get a free book with --

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.546
thank you Candle of Press

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.390
for providing free books
for our guests today.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.013
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Mary Brigid?

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.613
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: Yes?

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:08.946
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Whenever
you have a chance,

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.413
I need to acknowledge the
kids while we're here.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.346
Can I do it now?

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.680
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: Okay.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.213
John wants to talk about some

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.146
of the wonderful kids
in the audience today.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.413
&gt;&gt; John Cole: I want to give a
special welcome to four classes,

00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:29.660
schools who are with us today.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.296
They're brought here by the Old
Dominion Chapter of the Links.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.843
We are very pleased to welcome
kids, and I want to hear from them.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.583
When I mention your school, West
Gate Elementary from Manassas.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.643
Okay. One more item of business.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:11.176
Later on in the program
as John told you,

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.110
we are going to have a
wonderful dramatic presentation.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:15.976
But we need your help.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:16.800
Gerry, our wonderful assistant here,
is going to be holding up two signs.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.553
Can you show the signs?

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:24.820
And you can read the signs.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:26.553
You don't have to react now,
but when she holds up one

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:28.820
of these signs, make sure you
do what it says on the sign.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:29.620
It's your cue to help
us with the drama.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:32.886
Okay. Finally, it's the time

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.420
to introduce our wonderful
authors and illustrators.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:35.486

of Massachusetts,

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:51.806

we realize that many

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.473
of you have not had the opportunity

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.750
to discover the Exquisite
Corpse Adventure on Read.gov.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.906
And so we didn't want to just
jump into the last episode

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.963
without a little bit of a
summary to get you warmed

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.243
up for the dramatic performance.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.663
So Mr. Anderson, would
you help me out?

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:13.273
&gt;&gt; M.T. Anderson: Is my mike on?

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:15.226
Okay. For those of you who have
not yet tasted the delights

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:19.120
of the Exquisite Corpse Adventure

Roberta grabbed the hand
of the headless woman

paw that grabbed the hand

of the bearded woman who
grabbed a string of chimps

rosie about the startled whites

of air by the moment.

off by the giant meringue.

There wasn't even a

and dancing and shouting

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:33.203
I've always longed to ride
a bareback on elephants.

00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:35.536
And I'm a terrible cook."

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:37.070
&gt;&gt; "Yeah, why not?

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:40.936
The villains are gone
and our parents are here.

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:42.030
That was all that was wrong with
the Sick and Tired Circus --

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.343
villains here and parents missing."

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:48.313
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: Nancy
stroked the place on her arm

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:50.940
where the wolf had scratched her.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:51.743
The house with a picket
fence and two parents

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:56.576
with their twins no
longer seemed so desirable.

00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:00.410
Wasn't a circus the perfect
home for a girl who was,

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:03.450
at least for the present, part wolf?

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.913
And besides, she had promised
the wolves to speak out for them.

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:09.690
&gt;&gt; "Why not?"

00:37:10.690 --> 00:37:12.156
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:

00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:13.606
Hathi encircled the four
Sloppys with her warm trunk.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.773
&gt;&gt; "Then it's settled."

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:20.210
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: I
won't say it was the end

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:21.276
of all their adventures, for Nancy
and Joe were an adventurous pair,

00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:25.420
but it brings to a close the
Exquisite Corpse Adventure

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:29.600
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.000
&gt;&gt; -- evil conquered, family united,

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:35.000
and friends who lived,
I'm quite sure

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.306
&gt;&gt; Happily ever after.

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:40.510
[ Applause ]

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:47.440
&gt;&gt; Good job, my boys.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:48.280
&gt;&gt; Thank you, sir.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000

[ Laughter ]

00:37:56.350 --> 00:37:57.616
&gt;&gt; Yo, Mary Brigid.

00:37:58.350 --> 00:37:59.350
Nice job.

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:02.216
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: Thanks, Tim.

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:03.606
We actually finished before
we thought we were going to,

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:08.226
and it's so rare that kids
have so many distinguished

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:12.876
and talented authors and
illustrators on stage at one time.

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.380
Are there any questions
you would like to ask any

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.186
of our authors or illustrators?

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:19.790
Anybody? Yes.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.160
Okay, this is the question.

00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:28.860
And what's your name?

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:30.726
This is from Annie.

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.593
How did we get the story online?

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:38.716
Anybody want to answer that?

00:38:39.070 --> 00:38:40.536
Oh, I can answer that.

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:42.536
&gt;&gt; John Cole: Perfect.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:45.003
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: We got the story
online because as Mr. Cole,

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:46.240
Dr. Cole had mentioned, the
National Children's Book

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:47.833
and Literacy Alliance has
been working with the Center

00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:50.366
for the Book for over 10 years.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.566
We actually were the 10
o'clock event 10 years ago

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:59.993
at the very first National Book
Festival, so it's wonderful.

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:02.823
And we wanted to come
up with a great idea

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:04.370
that would get kids reading
and get kids writing,

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:08.100
and we thought the best way to do
that would be to create a wonderful,

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.573
whacky, entertaining story
that would last all year long.

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:15.796
And it's worked.

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:18.183
It's been quite successful, and
it's been a wonderful partnership.

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:21.810
So make sure you get to Read.gov.

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:25.876
And if you haven't read the
episodes, they are there for free.

00:39:27.230 --> 00:39:27.563
&gt;&gt; How did we get the story online?

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:30.040
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: Oh, how did
we get the story online?

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:32.286
&gt;&gt; John Cole: We got
the story online.

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:35.620
It was through Mary Brigid.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:37.553
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: Literally,

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:38.886
like literally how did
we get the story online?

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:40.820
Oh, my God.

00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:41.953
Well, I guess that's a technical

00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:44.820
&gt;&gt; Jeremy?

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:46.953
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: Yeah,
it's a technical question.

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:47.926
They wrote the episodes, and
then every two weeks we sent them

00:39:51.780 --> 00:39:54.313
by computer to the
Library of Congress,

00:39:57.550 --> 00:40:02.350
and the magical technology people at
the Library of Congress typed it all

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:08.450
up and got it right onto
the computer, like that.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.126
We woke up every second
Friday morning

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:15.533
and there was a whole new episode
and a whole new illustration.

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:17.360
&gt;&gt; M.T. Anderson: People who haven't
seen it, it actually looks like a --

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:21.833
you can read it as a book.

00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:25.063
It looks like a virtual
book on the Internet,

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:26.473
so you can actually read
it in sort of book format.

00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:27.980
&gt;&gt; Timothy Basil Ering: When
you first get to that home page,

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:33.246
you'll see all the episodes listed

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.100
and who wrote them
and illustrated them.

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:44.063
And there's actually a part
where you can click onto hear it

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:49.456
and a part to click on to read it.

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:53.570
And when you do, you'll end
up at that virtual book,

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:02.590
and there's an arrow
where you can click

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:05.326
to go back and forth in the pages.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.306
It's really well done.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:12.506
And all the readers who read
the episodes are excellent,

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:15.483
beautifully read.

00:41:16.350 --> 00:41:16.750
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: That was great, Tim.

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:20.216
You did much better than me.

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:21.616
All right, any, any

00:41:22.350 --> 00:41:25.483
&gt;&gt; Timothy Basil Ering:
I was impressed with it.

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:27.346
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: Any other kids
have questions, you can walk right

00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:29.626
up to one of the two
microphones in the aisles.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.733
Be brave. Your mom and
dad are going to be

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:37.856
so proud if you ask a question.

00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:39.263
Here comes somebody.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:41.463
What's your first name?

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:43.530
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth: Elizabeth.

00:41:43.930 --> 00:41:45.196
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: And where
are you from, Elizabeth?

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:47.463
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth: Virginia.

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:49.596
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: Virginia.

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:51.663
Elizabeth's from Virginia.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:53.330
What's your question?

00:41:53.930 --> 00:41:54.730
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth: I wondered
when we'll be able

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:56.530
to get the book of
the Exquisite Corpse.

00:41:57.930 --> 00:42:01.263
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: When you'll
be able to get the book

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:04.136
for the Exquisite Corpse?

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:05.526
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth: Yeah,
when are you getting it?

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.003
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: I think
you'll be able to get the book

00:42:09.930 --> 00:42:12.863
for the Exquisite Corpse
right here next year

00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:16.250
at the National Book Festival.

00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:17.390
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
So come back next year.

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:18.813
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: And just think,
we'll have all kinds of authors

00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:24.966
and illustrators again,
and you can get tons

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:28.340
of their signatures all at one time.

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:30.793
&gt;&gt; It will also be in stores.

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:32.346
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: It will
also be in stores, yes.

00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.486
&gt;&gt; And online as well.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:36.353
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: And online as well,

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:38.620
and also if you don't
have it this year,

00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:40.886
make sure you get those
posters at the back.

00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:42.086
And you could take two posters.

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:45.886
Any of the kids can take two
posters -- one for their home,

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:46.486
and one to take to
school and show off

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:48.420
to their teacher when
they get there.

00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:50.420
Any more? Oh, there's one over here.

00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.020

00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:57.420

00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.020
&gt;&gt; Nell: Yeah.

00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:01.620
I live in Massachusetts?

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:04.486
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: We
love Massachusetts.

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:06.153
&gt;&gt; Nell: My mom works in Boston.

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:09.020
&gt;&gt; Pardon?

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:10.153
&gt;&gt; Nell: My mom works in Boston.

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:12.820

Cradle of Democracy.

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:15.020
&gt;&gt; Nell: Yeah.

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.153
But why didn't you just release
it as a book to start off with?

00:43:18.020 --> 00:43:18.620
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: Why
didn't we release it

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:21.886
as a book to start off with?

00:43:22.020 --> 00:43:22.953
Well, actually, a little
bit of history here.

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:25.886
There's a real famous author

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.286
that you'll be reading
soon named Charles Dickens,

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:30.553
and over 100 years ago, he got all
kinds of people reading by putting

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:30.286
up a book one episode at the time,

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:33.753
in what in those days was high
technology -- a newspaper.

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:34.086
And now, we did the same thing.

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:38.553
We put one episode up at a time,
and we've been building the audience

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:39.886
and building the audience 'til
I think Library of Congress,

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.820
we are averaging in some months
over 120,000 hits a month.

00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:44.086
And that's just -- we figure
that a lot of those were teachers

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:46.620
and librarians who were going back
and sharing the book with the kids.

00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:47.020
So our low-ball estimate
is that over 500,000,

00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:49.953
possibly up to a million kids

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.620
around the world have been reading
the Exquisite Corpse episodes every

00:43:52.020 --> 00:44:32.040
two weeks.

Oh, right over here.

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:00.353
&gt;&gt; Which episode was your favorite?

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:02.886
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: I'll
let the authors answer.

00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:06.086
Which episode, other than your
own episode, was your favorite?

00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:06.153

make it a little harder.

Tobin, did you have
a favorite episode?

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:14.220
&gt;&gt; M.T. Anderson: I loved the way

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:16.686
that John Scieszka
began the whole thing.

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:19.886
He just did a wonderful job.

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:21.020
He's

&gt;&gt; M.T. Anderson: Yeah.

00:44:26.020 --> 00:44:28.553
He's not here, but yeah, he deserves
-- there was so much like energy

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:30.420
and enthusiasm in his episode that
we all were very inspired by it.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.220
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson: I immediately
volunteered to do Chapter 2

00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:33.953
because I thought, well, I know
John's first chapter's going

00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:35.553
to be crazy and it's going
to get crazier and crazier,

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.286
so I want to get in fast
before it gets too crazy.

00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.353
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: Linda Sue,
did you have a favorite?

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.153
&gt;&gt; Linda Sue: Well, I think that
Katherine had the hardest job.

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:43.686
It was a pretty unwieldy
package with lots of tentacles.

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:45.953
And she either wrapped them
neatly or just chopped them off.

00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:47.486
And I so admire the way that
she got the last chapter

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:49.886
to pull everything together.

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:51.686
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: And Tim, Tim
and James both did a number

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:52.286
of illustrations for the episodes.

00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.020
Which was your favorite episode
to illustrate, Tim and James?

00:44:56.020 --> 00:44:58.220
&gt;&gt; Timothy Basil Ering: I think
the Cradle of Time was really --

00:44:58.020 --> 00:44:59.620
the Cradle of Time was just
like -- that was written --

00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.753
I loved every one of them.

00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:04.353
And the Gingerbread House, the
door -- all of them were super fun,

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.753
but the Cradle of Time was
something just crazy and wild.

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:06.486
That was one of my
favorites, I think.

00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:08.753
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: And
what about you, James?

00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:12.553
&gt;&gt; James Ransome: I'm going to say
that first, it was just a pleasure

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:12.953
to work on all the
episodes that I worked on.

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:15.620
But I think the Lemony Snicket
episode was my favorite.

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:18.420
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: Yes, Lemony Snicket
wrote two of the episodes, too.

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:20.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah, which is really a lot
of fun, with the train crashes

00:45:20.020 --> 00:45:21.753
and all the different things
that he put in that episode.

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:22.220
And it was just fun illustrating.

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:25.753
But they're all wonderful.

00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:26.476
I still don't understand how the
writers can just sort of pick

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:34.163
up where someone else left off and
create these crazy -- it's insane.

00:45:36.130 --> 00:45:39.263
A pig with a one eye
patch, the baby, the robot.

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:42.780
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: The pirate.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:43.980
&gt;&gt; Arm-wrestling squid
or something like that.

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:45.980
I mean.

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.380
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: And I should say
that the reason we did this was --

00:45:48.980 --> 00:45:50.846
the way we did it with, we want
us to repeat that kind of game

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.913
that you all play at home.

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:54.846
You've played it at camp.

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:55.513
You've played it on a stormy night.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:59.426
You've played it when the lights
have gone out, if you live up north

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.186
and you get a winter
blackout, where one member

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:05.946
of the family starts a story and
stops at a cliff-hanging moment,

00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:06.253
and then Aunt Margaret takes
up the next step, the next one,

00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:10.020
and then Cousin Tommy does the next,

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:12.043
and then four-year-old
Benita does the next one.

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:17.196
And we wanted to keep
that spontaneity to it

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:18.060
so that pigs would feel free
to think, hey, this is a game

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:24.560
that we play, and we can
write like this, too.

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.853
That was a fabulous question.

00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:28.120
Thank you so much.

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:30.186
We'll go over here.

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:32.053
What's your name?

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:33.986
&gt;&gt; Linda: Linda.

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:35.786
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: Linda,
what's your question?

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:39.053
&gt;&gt; Linda: How come you gather up
here to start a huge festival?

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.986
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: I'm sorry; Linda,
could you repeat that again?

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:41.586
&gt;&gt; Linda: How come
you come to Washington

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.853
and start up a huge festival?

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:45.320
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: How
come you all come

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:47.253
to Washington to this big festival?

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.186
Why do you do that?

00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:52.053
&gt;&gt; Katherine Paterson:
Because it's so much fun.

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.053
&gt;&gt; Fun, fun, fun.

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:55.853
But did you ask how the
festival was started?

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:57.043
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: How the
festival was started.

00:46:59.730 --> 00:47:01.123
I think John Cole, we'd have
to bring John Cole up to answer

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:05.136
that question, how the
festival got started?

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:08.810
Mr. Cole will be the expert
to give you that answer.

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:14.183
&gt;&gt; John Cole: The festival
was started,

00:47:14.830 --> 00:47:19.163
came to us when Mrs. Laura Bush,
who was a reader and a librarian,

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:19.956
helped us start the first
book festival and had the idea

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:25.296
of bringing people together.

00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:29.096
And we are now able, after
ten years, to keep this going

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.836
with the help of wonderful
groups like the ones

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:32.360
and performers that
you've just seen.

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:34.743
And we're very pleased to have
you all here, and let's close

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:38.383
with one final round of applause
for my friends, the performers

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:44.623
and the Exquisite Corpse Adventure.

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:46.960
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:48.960
Thanks a lot.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:50.360
&gt;&gt; John Cole: You were
all wonderful,

00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.130
and we will have one more
session a year from now

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.730
at the next book festival, when
we not only will bring back some

00:47:57.450 --> 00:47:58.236
of the authors who have not
been part of the book festival,

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:00.863
but we will have the book for sale.

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:03.060
And as Mary Brigid said,
we can get it signed.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:05.533
Thank you all very
much, and thank you.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
[Applause]

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:09.400
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: Okay,
one more thing.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.600
&gt;&gt; Thank you, thank you.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:13.200
&gt;&gt; Mary Brigid: Those of you guys

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:15.600
that didn't get your
questions answered,

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.333
the autographing session
is from noon to 1 o'clock,

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.333
and if you have further questions,
I'm sure authors would be happy

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
to answer your questions then.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.400
And also, if you want to have a
winning program, make sure you head

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:25.083
in that direction to
get your free copy

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:30.183
of our White House
Looking In Looking Out.

00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.000
And it's also for sale
in the bookstore.

00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:37.883
And lastly, get your Exquisite
Corpse poster and share it

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:44.126
with your friends at school and
your cousins and all your relatives,

00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:49.743
and get grandma and grandpa reading
the Exquisite Corpse Adventure

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:54.000
with you, too.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:55.066
Bye-bye. Have a great festival.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.866
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:48:59.333
Visit us at LOC.gov.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000
