00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.790
Our discussion of knowledge-based
agents in this CS7637 class is

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.670
organized around seven principals.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.570
Be on the lookout for the seven
principals, they'll occur again and

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.580
again throughout the course.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.684
Principal number one, agents use
knowledge to guide reasoning and

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:22.151
they represent and organize this
knowledge into knowledge structures.

00:00:22.151 --> 00:00:25.472
Principle number two,
learning is often incremental.

00:00:25.472 --> 00:00:29.464
This connects back to one of
the characteristics of problems,

00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:32.946
where data and
experience was coming incrementally.

00:00:32.946 --> 00:00:36.629
Number three, reasoning is
top down not just bottom up.

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.400
We just don't reason from data,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.120
we also use data to pull
out knowledge from memory,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.070
then we use this knowledge to generate
expectations to make sense of the world.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.120
Principle number four, knowledge-based
AI agents match methods to tasks.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.254
We'll discuss a number
of different methods.

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:56.727
We'll also discuss several tasks.

00:00:56.727 --> 00:00:59.254
Later, we'll discuss how AI agents

00:00:59.254 --> 00:01:03.412
can select specific methods to
address particular tasks and

00:01:03.412 --> 00:01:07.662
even integrate different methods
to address complex tasks.

00:01:07.662 --> 00:01:09.061
Principle number five,

00:01:09.061 --> 00:01:12.600
agents use heuristics to find
solutions that are good enough.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.890
They do not necessarily
find optimal solutions.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.415
This is because of a trade off
between computer efficiency and

00:01:19.415 --> 00:01:21.188
the optimality of solutions.

00:01:21.188 --> 00:01:24.666
Our focus will be on using
bounded rationality and yet,

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:29.627
giving near real-time time performance
on [INAUDIBLE] intractable problems.

00:01:29.627 --> 00:01:30.537
This happens,

00:01:30.537 --> 00:01:35.020
because agents use heuristics to find
solutions that are just good enough.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.707
Principle number six,

00:01:38.707 --> 00:01:42.729
agents make use of recurring
patterns of problems in the world.

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.725
Of course,
there are a number of problems.

00:01:44.725 --> 00:01:49.362
But even this number of problems are
characterized the patterns that occur

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:50.472
again and again.

00:01:50.472 --> 00:01:55.625
Number seven, reasoning, learning and
memory constrain and support each other.

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:59.222
We'll build theories that are not
just theories of reasoning or

00:01:59.222 --> 00:02:03.485
theories of learning or theories of
memory, but we'll build theories that

00:02:03.485 --> 00:02:06.760
unify the three of them into
one single cognitive system.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.150
These principles will come again and
again in this particular class.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.120
So we highly recommend that you
take a moment, pause the video and

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.730
read over the principles once again.
