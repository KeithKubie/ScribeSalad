00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.669
&gt;&gt; Hello YouTube. I'm Ann Cotton. I'm a [inaudible]
entrepeneur here at Davos, the World Economic

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:16.080
Forum. There's a big economic issue being
discussed here which is really about exclusion

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.109
of women and girls for so many opportunities
and of course the likelihood of economic downturns.

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:25.429
That situation will actually get worse. So
we will undermine the real opportunity that

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:31.390
exists for change. My work is in Africa. I
lead an orgainization camp there, The Campaign

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.460
for Female Education that is supporting education,
leadership and enterprise of young girls and

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.570
women. And I came to Davos via Zambia in fact.
This time last week I was in a village down

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.770
there and they certainly not heard of the
national economic crisis, but they will feel

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.780
it, there's no doubt about that. There was
a report published by the World Bank in 2007

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.600
that showed that in the time between 1980
to 2004 and over other economic downturns,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.570
that over one million babies died which otherwise
would have survived, and that's the reality.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:15.360
It's a crisis of immense proportions. Not
only that, but what would also happen is that

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.490
girls would leave school prematurely. There
are currently 600 million children outside

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.380
education, 75% of them girls. And if they
do leave school, age 10, 11 and 12, they will

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.800
marry young. They will start having babies
when they are very young and their babies

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:39.400
will be born into poverty. The whole inter-generative
cycle of poverty will start all over again

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.700
and that will resonate down through the years.
That's an issue for all of us. An issue for

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.700
the global economic community. Because of
course, it effects everything, it effects

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.760
population growth, it effects the environment,
it effects child health and child mortality.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.530
So there's a real opportunity to address this.
To recognize the enormous impact that the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.240
crisis will have on the poorest of nations
and on the poorest in those nations. If you

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:14.890
take a look at conference website www.amfa.org
and get involved, and change and support the

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.640
opportunities that we must create for everybody
in the world. Thanks.
