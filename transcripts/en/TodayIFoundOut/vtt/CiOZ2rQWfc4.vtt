00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.559
Why Do Clocks Run Clockwise?

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.320
Pretty much everyone knows that if you’re
asked to pass something clockwise around a

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.840
table, you hand it to the person on your left
because that is the same direction that the

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.150
hands of a clock move.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.029
But what you may not know is that this standard
direction is a function not only of timekeeping,

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.980
but the Earth’s rotation and the happy accident
that much of human civilization evolved in

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.490
the Northern Hemisphere.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.060
If you could look directly at the North Pole
from space, it would appear to spin counterclockwise.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.380
Given that spin, when a stick is placed in
the ground parallel to the Earth’s axis

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.910
in, say, Egypt, the shadow cast by the stick
as the Sun moves across the sky will move

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.179
in a clockwise direction (notably, a similarly
placed stick in Australia would cast a shadow

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:54.300
that moves counterclockwise).

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.859
As far back as when the ancient Egyptians
and Babylonians were fashioning their first

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.030
shadow clocks (~3,500 BC), the measurement
of time moved in a clockwise direction.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.910
Even as more precise timekeeping methods came
about, sundials (which began in earnest around

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:15.860
1,500 BC) remained popular throughout the
middle ages and beyond, given their simplicity

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.360
of construction and relative reliability.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:32.520
(In fact, early mechanical clocks were often
regularly calibrated 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.170
to nearby sundials.)

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.500
So, when mechanical clocks were introduced
in Europe in the 14th century, their inventors

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.720
were quite familiar with sundials and the
clockwise direction that their shadows moved

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.210
and marked time.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.310
Accordingly, by the end of that century when
even cathedral clocks were sporting clock

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.820
faces, they were made in imitation of their
sundial forbears, which included hands that

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.340
moved in a clockwise direction.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.840
Notably, the word clockwise with its present
meaning did not appear in English until the

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.150
1870s, with counterclockwise also dating to
that decade.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.390
The use of wise to mean a way of proceeding
dates back to Old English.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.209
Clock isn’t nearly so old, and dates to
the invention of our modern mechanical clocks

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.609
(14th century).

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:27.740
It is thought to come from either clokke (Middle
Dutch), cloque (Old North French) or clocca

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.799
(Medieval Latin) which all meant bell.

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.420
Some of the earliest mechanical clocks were
simply designed to strike a bell at set intervals,

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.269
perhaps to announce prayer times or the like,
or simply ring on the hour, with these early

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.319
clocks not necessarily having any faces.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.430
And if you’re curious, before they were
called “clocks,” these early mechanical

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.911
clocks were called horologia, from the Greek
for “hour” (ὡρα) and “to tell”

00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:51.911
(λέγειν).

00:02:51.911 --> 00:02:52.959
Ever wonder what a.m. and p.m. stand for?

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.780
Well, wonder no more: a.m. stands for “ante
meridiem”, which is Latin for “Before

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:07.769
Midday”; p.m. stands for “Post Meridiem”,
which is Latin 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:23.379
for “After Midday”.
