00:00:00.424 --> 00:00:02.840
Let's review a little bit of
everything we learned so far.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.350
And hopefully make
everything fit together

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:04.920
a little bit better.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.480
And then we'll do a bunch of
calculations with real numbers.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.590
And I think it'll really
hit the point home.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.760
So first of all, let
me make some columns.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.720
So if we're dealing
with-- let's see.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.310
We could call it the concept.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.810
And then we'll call
it the-- whether we're

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:34.470
dealing with a
population or a sample.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.060
So the first statistical
concept we came up with

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.310
was the notion of the mean
or the central tendency.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.010
And we learned that
that was one way

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.630
to measure the average or
central tendency of a data set.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.160
The other ways were the
median and the mode.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.660
But the mean tends to show up
a lot more, especially when we

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.470
start talking about
variances, and we'll

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.440
do in this video, the
standard deviation.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.210
But the mean of a
population, we learned--

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.630
we use the Greek letter mu--
is equal to the sum of each

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.780
of the data points
in the population.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.290
That's an I. Let me make
sure it looks like an I.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.240
So you're going to sum up
each of those data points.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.647
You're going to start
with the first one.

00:01:15.647 --> 00:01:17.230
And you're going to
go to the Nth one.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.070
We're assuming that there are n
data points in the population.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.924
And then you divide by the
total number that you have.

00:01:22.924 --> 00:01:24.590
And this is like the
average that you're

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.080
used to taking before you
learned any of the statistic

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.580
stuff.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.871
You add up all the data points.

00:01:28.871 --> 00:01:30.780
And you divide by
the number there are.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.380
The sample is the same thing.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.170
We just use a slightly
different terminology.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.100
The mean of a sample-- and I'll
do it in a different color.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.940
Just write it as x
with a line on top.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.780
And that's equal to
the sum of all the data

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.900
points in the sample.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.962
So each of the x
sine in the sample.

00:01:49.962 --> 00:01:51.920
But we're assuming the
sample is something less

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:52.930
than a population.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:55.490
So you start with
the first one still.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.840
And then you go to
the lowercase n,

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.040
where we assume that lowercase
n is less than the big N.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.960
If this was the same thing,
then we're just actually taking

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.850
the average, or we're taking the
mean, of the entire population.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.850
And then you divide by
the number of data points

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.710
you added.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.990
You get to n.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.572
Then we said, OK, this gives
us the central tendency.

00:02:15.572 --> 00:02:17.280
It's one measure of
the central tendency.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.630
But what if we wanted to
know how good of an indicator

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.810
this is for the population
or for the sample.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.690
Or on average, how far are the
data points from this mean?

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.490
And that's where we came up
with the concept of variance.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.390
And I'll arbitrarily
switch colors again.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.040
And in a population,
the variable,

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.220
or the notation for variance,
is the sigma squared.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.510
This means variance.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.760
And that is equal to-- you
take each of the data points.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.040
You find the difference
between that and the mean

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.180
that you calculate up there.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.060
You square it.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.820
So you get the
squared difference.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.400
And then you essentially take
the average of all of these.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.760
You take the average of all
of these squared distances.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.960
So that's if you take the sum
from i is equal to one to N.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.535
And you divide it by
N. That's the variance.

00:03:13.535 --> 00:03:14.910
And then the
variance of a sample

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.180
mean, and this was a little
bit more interesting.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.500
And we talked a little bit
about it in the last video.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.680
You actually want
to provide a, you

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.137
want to estimate the
variance of the population

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:25.970
when you're taking the
variance of a sample.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.030
And in order to provide
an unbiased estimate,

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.830
you do something
very similar to here.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.800
But you end up
dividing by n minus 1.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.460
So let me write that down.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.930
So the variance of a
population-- sorry.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.310
The variance of a sample,
or sample variance,

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.150
or unbiased sample
variance-- and that's

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.570
why we're going to
divide by n minus 1.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.315
That's denoted by s squared.

00:03:46.315 --> 00:03:48.440
What you do is you take
the difference between each

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:53.810
of the data points in the
sample minus the sample mean.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.110
We assume that we don't
know the population mean.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.800
Maybe we did.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.369
If we knew the population
mean, we actually

00:03:59.369 --> 00:04:01.410
wouldn't have to do the
unbiased thing that we're

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.910
going to do here
in the denominator.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.442
But when you have a sample,
the only way to kind of figure

00:04:05.442 --> 00:04:07.150
out the population
mean is to estimate it

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.250
with the sample mean.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.060
So we assume that we only
have the sample mean.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.080
And you're going
to square those.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.140
And then you're
going to sum them up.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.420
Sum them up from i is equal
to one to i is equal to n.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.029
Because you have n data points.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:23.990
And if you want an
unbiased estimator,

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.999
you divide by n minus 1.

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:28.790
And we talked a little
bit before about why

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.970
you want this to be n
minus 1 instead of an n.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.630
And actually, in a
couple of videos,

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.320
I'll actually prove this to you.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.181
One I'll prove, maybe
experimentally, using Excel.

00:04:37.181 --> 00:04:38.930
And then I'll-- which
wouldn't be a proof.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.600
But it'll just give you a
little bit of intuition.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.230
And then I'll actually prove
it a little bit more formally

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:43.000
later on.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.070
But you don't have to
worry about it right now.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.995
Now, the next thing
we'll learn is something

00:04:46.995 --> 00:04:49.274
that you've probably
heard a lot of.

00:04:49.274 --> 00:04:50.940
Especially, sometimes,
in class teachers

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.800
talk about the standard
deviation of a test,

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.220
or it's actually, probably,
one of the most used words

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.410
in statistics.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.680
I think a lot of
people, unfortunately,

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:06.410
maybe use it or maybe use it
without fully appreciating

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:08.330
everything that it involves.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.050
But the goal-- well,
we'll eventually,

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.140
hopefully, appreciate all
that it involves soon.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.620
But the standard deviation.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.430
And once you know variance, it's
actually quite straightforward.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.830
It's the square root
of the variance.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.170
So the standard
deviation of a population

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:33.630
is written as sigma which
is equal to the square root

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.690
of the variance.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.260
And now, I think,
you understand why

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.100
variance is written
as sigma squared.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.720
And that is equal to just
the square root of all that.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.040
It's equal to the square
root-- I'll probably

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.590
run out of space--
of all of that.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.497
So I won't write the
top at the bottom.

00:05:49.497 --> 00:05:50.330
That makes it messy.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:56.280
If xi minus mu squared.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.570
Everything over N.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.240
And then, if you wanted the
standard deviation of a sample,

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.780
and it actually gets a
little bit interesting.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.180
Because the standard
deviation of a sample,

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.100
which is equal to
the square root

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.467
of the variance of a sample.

00:06:09.467 --> 00:06:11.050
It actually turns
out that this is not

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.920
an unbiased estimator for this.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.220
And I don't want to get too
technical for it right now.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.930
But this is actually a
very good estimate of this.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.520
The expected value of
this is going to be this.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:26.540
And I'll go into more depth on
expected values in the future.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.860
But it turns out that
this is not quite

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.990
the same expected value as this.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.220
But you don't have to
worry about it for now.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.870
So why even talk about
the standard deviation?

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.870
Well, one, the units
work out a little better.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.860
If, let's say, all
of our data points

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.230
we're measured in meters, right?

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.720
If we were taking a bunch
of measurements of length,

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.400
then the units of the variance
would be meter squared, right?

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.350
Because we're taking
meters minus meters.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.870
This would be a meter.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.036
And then you're squaring it.

00:06:51.036 --> 00:06:52.340
You're getting meters squared.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.340
And that's kind of a
strange concept if you say,

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:57.534
the average dispersion from the
center has been meter squared.

00:06:57.534 --> 00:06:59.700
So well, first, when you
take the square root of it,

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.762
you get something
that's, again, in meters.

00:07:02.762 --> 00:07:04.220
So you're kind of
saying, oh, well,

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.045
the standard deviation
is x or y meters.

00:07:07.045 --> 00:07:08.420
And then we'll
learn a little bit

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:12.020
that If you can actually model
your data as a bell curve,

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.727
or if you assume that your data
has a distribution of a bell

00:07:14.727 --> 00:07:16.810
curve, then this tells you
some interesting things

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.930
about where all of the
probability of finding someone

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.957
within one or two standard
deviations of the mean.

00:07:23.957 --> 00:07:26.290
But, anyway, I don't want to
go too technical right now.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.920
Let's just calculate a bunch.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:37.000
Let's calculate, let's say, if
I had numbers 1, 2, 3, 8, and 7.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.990
And let's say that
this is a population.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.870
So what would its mean be?

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.340
So I have 1 plus 2 plus 3.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.570
So it's 3 plus 3 is 6.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:49.241
6 plus 8 is 14.

00:07:49.241 --> 00:07:51.640
14 plus 7 is 21.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.490
So the mean of this population,
you sum up all the data points.

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:59.250
You get 21 divided by the
total number of data points.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.250
One, two, three, four, five.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.480
21 divided by 5 which
is equal to what?

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.020
4.20.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.350
Fair enough.

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:09.860
Now, we want to figure
out the variance.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:12.720
And we're assuming that this
is the entire population.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.390
So the variance of this
population is going to be equal

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:18.800
to the sum of the squared
differences of each of these

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.060
numbers from 4.20

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.260
I'm going to have to
get my calculator out.

00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:27.180
So it's going to be
1 minus 4.20 squared,

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:37.380
plus 2 minus 4.20 squared,
plus 3 minus 4.20 squared,

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:47.370
plus 8 minus 4.20 squared,
plus 7 minus 4.20 squared.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.994
And it's going to
be all of that--

00:08:48.994 --> 00:08:50.660
and I know it looks
a little bit funny--

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:55.680
divided by the number of data
points we have, divided by 5.

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.470
So let me take the
calculator out.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.180
All right.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:03.084
Here we go.

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:05.500
Actually, maybe I should have
used the graphing calculator

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.300
that I have.

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:11.920
Let me see if I
can get this thing,

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.683
if I could get this-- Oh.

00:09:19.599 --> 00:09:20.140
There you go.

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.890
Yeah, I think the graphing
one will be better.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.122
Because I can see
everything that I'm writing.

00:09:25.122 --> 00:09:27.170
OK, so let me clear this.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:35.360
So I want to take 1 minus
4.20 squared, plus--

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:44.640
let me write it down--
plus 2 minus 4.20 squared,

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:59.460
plus 3 minus 4.20 squared, plus
8 minus 4.20 squared, right?

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.990
I'm just taking the sum
of the squared distances

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:04.370
from the mean.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:10.640
One more, plus 7
minus 4.20 squared.

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.330
So that's the sum.

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:14.340
The sum is 38.80,
so the numerator.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:18.950
So this is going to be
equal to 38.80 divided by 5.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.530
So this is the sum of the
square distances, right?

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:23.340
Each of these, just
so you can relate

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:28.710
to the formula, each of that
is xi minus the mean squared.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:31.650
And so if we take the sum
of all of them, right?

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:34.310
This numerator is
the sum of each

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:42.850
of the xi minus the mean
squared from i equals 1 to N.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:45.222
And that ended up to be 38.80.

00:10:45.222 --> 00:10:46.680
And I just calculated
it like that.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.450
I just took each of the data
points minus the mean squared,

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:50.300
added them all up.

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:51.810
And I got 38.80.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.990
And I want to divide
it by N which is 5.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:57.440
So this N up here is
actually, also, 5.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.040
Right?

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:08.480
And so 38.80 divided
by 5 is 7.76.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:14.160
So let me scroll
down a little bit.

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:19.180
The variance is equal to 7.76.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:24.330
Now, if this was a sample
of a larger distribution,

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.460
if the 1, 2, 3, 8, and 7
weren't the population,

00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:30.950
if it was a sample from
a larger population,

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:33.510
instead of dividing by 5,
we would have divided by 4.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:37.080
And we would have gotten
the variance as 38.80.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.630
Sorry.

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:45.190
38.80 divided by N minus
1 which is divided by 4.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:49.740
So then we would have gotten
the sample variance at 9.70.

00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:52.110
If you would have divided
by N minus 1 instead of n.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.410
But, anyway, don't worry
about that right now.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:54.960
That's just a change
of N. But once

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.876
you have the variance,
very easy to figure out

00:11:56.876 --> 00:11:58.140
the standard deviation.

00:11:58.140 --> 00:11:59.890
You just take the
square root of it.

00:11:59.890 --> 00:12:09.750
The square root of 7.76, 2.78.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:13.060
Let's say 2.79 is the
standard deviation.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:15.830
So this gives us some
measure of, on average,

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:21.130
how far the numbers are away
from the mean which was 4.20.

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:23.200
And it gives it in
kind of the units

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.520
of the original measurement.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.999
Anyway, I'm all out of time.

00:12:25.999 --> 00:12:27.290
I'll see you in the next video.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:28.665
Well, actually,
let's figure out.

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:33.960
We said if this was a sample,
if those numbers were a sample

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.100
and not the population, then
we figured out that the sample

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.670
variance was 9.70.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:43.430
And so then the sample
standard deviation

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.000
is just going to be the
square root of that.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:53.932
The square root of 9.70
which would be 3.13, 3.11.

00:12:53.932 --> 00:12:56.390
Anyway, hopefully that makes
it a little bit more concrete.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:58.590
We've been dealing with
these sigma notation

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:00.090
variables and all that so far.

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:01.715
So when you actually
do it with numbers

00:13:01.715 --> 00:13:03.920
you see it's, hopefully,
not that difficult.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.028
Anyway, see you
in the next video.
