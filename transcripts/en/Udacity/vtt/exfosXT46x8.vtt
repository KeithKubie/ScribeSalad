00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now we've got this great property.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We've got two things that are significantly different from 1/2.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Can we use that to break the cipher?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now the question is assuming that the probability of ΔK is 0 is still 1/2,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
does knowing that these probabilities for ΔM and ΔS being greater than 1/2 help us?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Remember that our ciphertext values that we're intercepting

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
are the XOR of ΔM, ΔK, and ΔS.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The choices are, yes, that it definitely helps us.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It doesn't necessarily help us, but if we knew something more about K

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
maybe it would help us.

00:00:37.000 --> 99:59:59.000
It doesn't necessarily help us, but if we knew something more about M maybe it would help us.
