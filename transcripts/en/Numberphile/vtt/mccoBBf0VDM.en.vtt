00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.480
The theorem implies that there will be an infinite number of undecidable sentences,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.860
sentences which are true which cannot be proved.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.300
So, because then, you might hope, well, we could just add those finite number as axioms

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.040
and then we will have a complete.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:25.260
This is, the incompleteness is referring to the fact that there's this kind of gap between truth and proof.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.700
We'd love a complete system where we've got a set of axioms, and all truths can be proved.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.500
So incompleteness refers to the fact that you can never kind of

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.420
complete it.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:44.800
Brady: "How will a mathematician ever know if what they're working on is truly undecidable, or falls into the Gödel basket?

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.460
"It seems like you could have things in your too hard basket, and you would say, ah, this must be a Gödel problem."

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.360
I think that's one of the real challenges for mathematicians.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.820
And I think most of us, actually, kind of, slightly stick our head in the sand, and go, "lalalalala! you know, I don't really want to know about that" because,

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.140
and I think it's important when you're going in to try to prove a theorem, that you believe you can prove it.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.700
I mean, there are other issues, actually, about provability which are complexity issues.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.940
We know that there are some proofs that will be of a complexity that our human mind

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.000
will never be able to navigate.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.780
We sort of feel like number theory throws up statements which are easy to write down,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.480
but the complexity, look at Fermat's last theorem,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.120
that, the complexity of that is immense compared to the statement of

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.420
there being no solutions to these equations.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.300
And we know, just for mathematical reasons, there will be statements which, whose proofs are of a length that

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.560
even the universe, as a, consider the universe as a computer,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.280
it will not be able to crunch out before time ends.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:59.660
I think that Gödel's revelation did change people's kind of conception about mathematics.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.900
Because I think there was a feeling, like, we should be able to prove anything that's true.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.440
So I think there was a kind of shift.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.500
But, you know, that's just something we have to, have to deal with.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.400
It gives mathematics an interesting sort of complexity to it that wasn't there before.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.660
So, and there's something intriguing about the way that we, as humans, can pull ourselves outside a system.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.920
And this, actually, has been used by some to suggest that this is why human consciousness

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.020
is actually much more than just an analog computer.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.880
Because how can an analog computer pull itself out of the system that it's stuck within?

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.640
Yet we seem to be able to shift from outside the system to see meaning

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.460
of that sentence, go inside the system, prove that it can't be proved.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.660
But, you know, so someone like Roger Penrose has used Gödel as a kind of challenge to whether

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.240
human consciousness can ever be captured by something like a, like a conventional computer.

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.140
There is a challenge to that kind of idea of saying, well, humans are better than machines.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:19.080
Because the challenge is that even when we're working outside the system, we are ourselves still working within another system,

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.640
which we're assuming is consistent, doesn't have contradictions, but we're having to make that assumption.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.280
So I think this feeling like, well, we're better than the machine, well, we have to remember that

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.100
we're also limiting ourselves within our own system of logical thought.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:42.740
There's a lovely sentence. Because we can't prove, one of Gödel's conclusions is that

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:49.560
we cannot prove that mathematics does not have contradictions in it.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.180
And that's also very unsettling.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.080
I mean, it's amazing. We've been doing mathematics for several thousand years,

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.820
and nobody's come up with any contradictions.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:02.340
So that's a good evidence that it does work.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.920
But that's not to say that there might not be some really subtle thing which will crash it.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.880
And I think that we really had to think about this very carefully

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.980
when Russell was coming up with paradoxes about set theory.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.800
We had to have a new conception about sets

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.560
because of his challenge of paradoxes which seemed to be things which were quite mathematical in nature.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:30.140
But there's a lovely quote by one of my heroes, André Weil, a French mathematician, number theorist, who says, you know,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.360
God exists because mathematics is consistent. The devil exists because we cannot prove that it is consistent.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:45.180
Brady: "When you look at what Gödel did, what was it about his theorem that was brilliant, or a leap or clever?

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.060
"Like, what, what was the new thing he came up with that all the, all the people before hadn't thought of?

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.020
"What was the brilliance of it?"

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.140
Gödel's brilliance was this idea of allowing mathematics to talk about itself.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:04.220
And at its heart is this idea of being able to code every statement in mathematics

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.380
with its own unique code number.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.160
And, I mean, I like it because one of my obsessions, as people might know, is prime numbers,

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:18.380
and Gödel uses the primes very cleverly to produce this coding.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:25.140
So, essentially, every logical symbol gets its own sort of prime number, and the number of times it's used,

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:29.560
where it's used, is kind of coded in the power of that prime.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.280
And I think this was, really, the extraordinary revelation.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.560
That mathematics could be self-referential.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:40.680
How could you talk about proving things in mathematics mathematically?

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.980
But using this coding, there was a way to do it.

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.780
So for me, that was the brilliance of Gödel.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:53.480
Brady: "All statements, all symbols, everything can be coded using these numbers.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.300
"Can you give me some idea how big these numbers are? It's not like, a plus sign is a 7,

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.120
"and a divide sign is a 13, are we, these are like mega-numbers?"

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:08.020
No, no, no. They start really small. You don't need to, so the first logical symbol

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.860
will have the prime 2, the second one 3, 5, 7, so,

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.060
but the point is that when you're actually taking a statement of mathematics

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.640
and looking at its code number, that will be a product of all of these primes,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:27.540
the power of the prime will be also indicating something about the structure of that sentence,

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:33.020
so once you start multiplying all of these primes together, you get incredibly huge numbers.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.560
But you're right. The ingredients are really the first few prime numbers. So yeah.

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:44.720
Brady: "So if I was to go and get Andrew Wiles' famous proof, and strip it back to its barest of bare bones,

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.020
"which is still pretty massive, I could, it would, I could spit out a number at the end,

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.480
"that could be printed out on a piece of paper."

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.860
Yes. It means that the statement of Fermat's last theorem itself will have a code number,

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:03.520
that every single logical step in that proof will have its own code number,

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:11.200
and so you can write down the proof of Fermat's last theorem as one whacking great number.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.740
Brady: "Has it changed the subject? Has it changed mathematics? Or is it just this

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.920
"land mine that's out there that you all hope you're not stepping on?"

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:25.800
I think that we kind of have to have this arrogant belief that the thing we're working on we can prove.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:31.000
It's almost part of the makeup of being a mathematician is that, I mean, you know,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.080
it's not just Gödel, it's about saying, well, maybe this is so complex my brain isn't going to manage to prove it.

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:46.260
I think it's amazing how much mathematics we are able to capture with our, the finite equipment in our heads.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:52.720
So I don't think it really has changed too fundamentally the mindset of the mathematician.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.620
But we all have to be wary of that.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:02.060
There's a lovely novel by Apostolos Doxiadis called Uncle Petros &amp; The Goldbach Conjecture.

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:08.200
And this is about a Greek mathematician who's been working on the Goldbach Conjecture

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:14.100
and he then suddenly discovers, it's set in the 1930s, he suddenly comes across this work of Gödel,

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:16.520
and it completely undermines his work.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:21.680
What if!? What if this is a statement which is true which doesn't have a proof?

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:27.500
And I tell you, Goldbach has a kind of feel of that. Because it's sort of combining two things

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:31.860
that probably shouldn't have anything to do with each other: addition and

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:37.340
the atoms of multiplication, the primes. So it might just be something which happens to be true,

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.940
but doesn't really have a good proof from the axioms.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:46.360
Gödel's incompleteness theorem really captured the public imagination

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:51.140
because it sort of seemed to show a limitations of knowledge,

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.320
and people kind of like that idea.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.700
And it seemed to show that mathematics wasn't as all-powerful as people thought.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:03.420
But I think you have to be cautious here. Because the weird thing is that we can prove that

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.900
that statement is true, it's just working outside the system.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.980
It's, so, you know, we're still pretty powerful, mathematicians.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:16.860
But I think it does show that within any system there will be limitations.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:22.060
So I think, you know, I spent the last three years on this kind of journey, inspired by Gödel,

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:28.020
to look at the other sciences to see whether they have their own statements

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:33.300
which, by their very nature, may be unknowable.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.960
I think there's a kind of feeling, maybe science can know it all,

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.600
but, so are there any kind of other sciences which have similar, sort of, limitations

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.640
on what they could possibly know?

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:50.920
Lots of things we don't know now, but maybe there are questions that by their nature, we can never know.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:57.420
There's a lovely story that Hilbert goes to become an honorary citizen of his home town of Königsberg.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:02.420
He's given this great honor, and he makes his declaration:

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:06.580
Wir müssen werden wir werden werden

00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.280
My German isn't good enough. We must know we shall know.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.120
This belief that there is no what he called ignorabimus.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.620
No ignorance.

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:19.960
What he didn't realize it that Kurt Gödel, in the same town of Königsberg, a few days earlier,

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.780
had given his talk about this great new theorem, the incompleteness theorem

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.760
showing that ignorabimus is actually part of mathematics.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.600
Brady: "And also it seems like that should have been Hilbert's number one. It seems so fundamental

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.560
"it should have been at the top of his list."

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:41.800
Well, it's interesting. Because Hilbert's first problem does relate to something that Gödel was also interested in,

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:47.180
which is the nature of infinity. So, it's something called the continuum hypothesis, which asks,

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:53.880
is there an infinite set between the countable numbers and the continuum, the set,

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.160
the size of the continuum, the size of all the real numbers?

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.620
Maybe there's an infinite set between those.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:04.900
Now here's an interesting example of a challenge,

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.340
mathematically, surely we should be able to work that out.

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:14.100
It turned out, thanks to Gödel, and Cohen, as well, that you can choose your answer.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:19.180
So you can't prove within mathematics that either this is true, or its negation is true

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.780
so much so that you can actually put either in as an axiom,

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.780
and if mathematics was consistent before, it's still consistent.

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:33.360
Gödel did have make some other interesting contributions, not just to mathematics, to physics.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:40.580
He took, he was a great friend of Einstein, in Princeton, they used to walk to the Institute for Advanced Study

00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:43.640
together in the morning.

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:50.040
And he looked at Einstein's equations for general relativity

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:55.280
and he showed that there's a solution of those equations where time is circular.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.380
So you get these loops happening. Now, we presume that that can't physically happen

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:03.740
because that would imply certain paradoxes like the grandfather paradox,

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.280
you'd be able to go back and kill your grandfather.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:12.240
But it's fascinating that Gödel, again, was able to prove these slightly paradoxical solutions

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.200
to the theory of general relativity.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:22.400
The other intriguing thing he did was he took the American constitution and he discovered a logical inconsistency in that,

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.780
which completely invalidated any statement that you would make.

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:30.960
And so, when he became an American citizen, I think he was going to raise this,

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:37.480
and say, well, actually you realize that there's a logical inconsistency which completely invalidates any statement that's here.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:43.780
And I think he was encouraged not to bring that up at his kind of ceremony to become a citizen.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.520
Gödel had a really tragic end, because he became very paranoid when he was in America

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.320
that people were trying to poison him.

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.600
And he essentially starved himself to death because he was so terrified that

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.180
any food was, was actually gonna kill him.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:06.960
So it's a kind of sad ending to an extraordinary life.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.560
...a truth value to it. But then when I went up to University I realized that in mathematics you can't have those.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:21.160
Yet when I took this course on mathematical logic, and we learned about Gödel's incompleteness theorem,
