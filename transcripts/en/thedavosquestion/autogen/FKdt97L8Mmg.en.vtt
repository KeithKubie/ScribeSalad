Belize of the governments were so you

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920
Belize of the governments were so you

Belize of the governments were so you
spend beyond your income then you

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840
spend beyond your income then you
 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.380
spend beyond your income then you
accumulate debt and you're incurring in

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390
accumulate debt and you're incurring in
 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.729
accumulate debt and you're incurring in
higher deficits because you need to pay

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739
higher deficits because you need to pay
 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.709
higher deficits because you need to pay
interest on your debt and that's like a

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719
interest on your debt and that's like a
 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.350
interest on your debt and that's like a
like a snowball that keeps growing and

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360
like a snowball that keeps growing and
 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.720
like a snowball that keeps growing and
in some cases several countries arrive

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
in some cases several countries arrive

two levels of government deficits of ten

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309
two levels of government deficits of ten

two levels of government deficits of ten
percent of gross domestic product and

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140
percent of gross domestic product and
 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.860
percent of gross domestic product and
that is was clearly unsustainable so

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870
that is was clearly unsustainable so
 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.139
that is was clearly unsustainable so
countries needed to implement fiscal

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149
countries needed to implement fiscal
 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.279
countries needed to implement fiscal
adjustments and fiscal adjustments are

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289
adjustments and fiscal adjustments are
 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.619
adjustments and fiscal adjustments are
costly and in the short term they are

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629
costly and in the short term they are
 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.590
costly and in the short term they are
probably contractionary so you have the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600
probably contractionary so you have the
 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.230
probably contractionary so you have the
need to adjust fiscally it does

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240
need to adjust fiscally it does
 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.240
need to adjust fiscally it does
adjustment means cutting spending

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250
adjustment means cutting spending
 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.580
adjustment means cutting spending
raising taxes at a moment when the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590
raising taxes at a moment when the
 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.410
raising taxes at a moment when the
economy is weak and there is a problem

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420
economy is weak and there is a problem
 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.670
economy is weak and there is a problem
that is the economic reason and part of

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680
that is the economic reason and part of
 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.450
that is the economic reason and part of
this may be a response to the crisis of

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460
this may be a response to the crisis of
 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.190
this may be a response to the crisis of
2008-2009 when governments tried to

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
2008-2009 when governments tried to
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.899
2008-2009 when governments tried to
stimulate their economies but then the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909
stimulate their economies but then the
 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.480
stimulate their economies but then the
stimulate the stimulus package needs to

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490
stimulate the stimulus package needs to
 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.670
stimulate the stimulus package needs to
be phased out and when you face that

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680
be phased out and when you face that
 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.770
be phased out and when you face that
you're left with a higher level of

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780
you're left with a higher level of
 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.210
you're left with a higher level of
government debt that is the economic

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220
government debt that is the economic
 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.429
government debt that is the economic
reason but there's a different reason we

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439
reason but there's a different reason we
 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.010
reason but there's a different reason we
know or pretty much know when we have to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
know or pretty much know when we have to
 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.190
know or pretty much know when we have to
do in terms or what needs to be done in

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
do in terms or what needs to be done in
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.080
do in terms or what needs to be done in
terms of solving the economic problem

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090
terms of solving the economic problem
 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.819
terms of solving the economic problem
but then the second issue is political

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829
but then the second issue is political
 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.819
but then the second issue is political
and it's the political agreement and the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829
and it's the political agreement and the
 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.670
and it's the political agreement and the
ability of the countries of the EU and

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680
ability of the countries of the EU and
 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.460
ability of the countries of the EU and
mainly the European the eurozone because

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470
mainly the European the eurozone because
 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.499
mainly the European the eurozone because
those are 17 members of the eurozone to

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509
those are 17 members of the eurozone to
 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.620
those are 17 members of the eurozone to
act together and to act decisively in a

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
act together and to act decisively in a
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.569
act together and to act decisively in a
timely manner and that is what has been

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579
timely manner and that is what has been
 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.459
timely manner and that is what has been
lacking so I think the very important

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469
lacking so I think the very important
 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.260
lacking so I think the very important
part in the solution to this problem

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270
part in the solution to this problem
 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.660
part in the solution to this problem
having laid out where the problem is is

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
having laid out where the problem is is
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.089
having laid out where the problem is is
the decision and to act together and to

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099
the decision and to act together and to
 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.800
the decision and to act together and to

act decisively in the
or term otherwise if we don't act I

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150
or term otherwise if we don't act I
 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.089
or term otherwise if we don't act I
never countries don't act in a

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099
never countries don't act in a
 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.770
never countries don't act in a
reasonable period of time what we're

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780
reasonable period of time what we're
 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.780
reasonable period of time what we're
gonna have is a much bigger problem in

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790
gonna have is a much bigger problem in
 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:21.530
gonna have is a much bigger problem in

the solution is costlier by the moment

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180
the solution is costlier by the moment
 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.050
the solution is costlier by the moment
if you fail to act what you can act on

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060
if you fail to act what you can act on
 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.319
if you fail to act what you can act on
is a bigger problem
