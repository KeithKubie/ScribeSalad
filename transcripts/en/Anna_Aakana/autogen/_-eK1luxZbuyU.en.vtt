00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:05.969
Depression is the only illness where people want to know your qualifications. I'm asked all the time:

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.700
"Like… what do you have to be depressed about?"

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.920
- "Well, I–"
- "You're like, I don't know, in a loving relationship"

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.360
- "Yeah, but–"
- "…and your career is going well. So like, why then?"

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.820
-"Well, I mean, there's no good like reason for it.
That's why it's called clinical depression,"

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.480
"because if there was the reason I would just be justifiably sad."

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.480
- "Oh"

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.360
"I still don't get it"

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.620
And people are always offering me unsolicited advice like:

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.960
"Have you tried… positive thinking?"

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.840
"I have one word for you:"

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:42.900
"probiotics"

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.620
"Meditation is the answer because depression can't exist in the zen zone."

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.580
Mental illness is its own unique  conundrum because if you have a physical ailment people are immediately sympathetic

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.700
"Oh, no, I'll make you some soup."

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.720
- "Hey, let me know if there's anything that I could do for you."

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.360
- "Oh, you poor baby. Do you want me to bring  you some healing crystals?"

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.980
But if that illness is mental? Yeah, they kind of have a different attitude about it

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.640
"EWWWWWWWWWWWWWW"

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.160
I think that's the best way to talk to someone with depression is actually not talking at all but listening with

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.960
compassion and not trying to provide solutions.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.800
I mean unless that solution is encouraging someone to go to therapy

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.159
which is great to therapy is awesome everyone should do it.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.560
But not necessarily trying to fix somebody's illness.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.320
And I know that our instinct when someone is sad is to try to cheer them up or try to help them

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.200
But depression isn't personal and it's not going to go away with a pep talk.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.620
You can say supportive things like:

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.760
- "I'm here for you"

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.880
- "Is there anything that I can do right now?"

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.680
- "Look, you may not believe it right now, but the way that you're feeling is totally going to change"

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.900
But maybe stay away from:

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.300
- "Look on the bright side!"

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.580
- "We all go through times like this."

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.100
- "Like depression is just all in your head. You can totally overcome it, it's just mind over matter."

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.420
And I think it's also really important to note that you should try to protect yourself too when dealing with a depressed person

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.680
If you're naturally an empath or susceptible to other people's emotions,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.600
it can be really difficult to separate yourself from it.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.540
I mean, I've definitely been guilty of trying to be there for a depressed person,

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.760
and letting their illness affect my mental state which isn't good for either of us.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.540
So setting your own boundaries to protect your emotions is so important.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.280
And if you're talking to a depressed person or depressed yourself

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.080
I think a good rule of thumb, for that and for life in general, is just that:

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.000
Everybody wants to be heard.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.260
So listening with compassion can make a huge difference in somebody's life

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.340
I know it sounds like so simple and obvious, but you would be surprised and how rarely it actually happens.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.239
I'm Anna Akana, good luck
