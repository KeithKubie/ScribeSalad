00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.100
As you can see here, QRDA statistics

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.930
can be reported at one of three
levels of detail called categories.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.620
These are all reported in
a CDA-compliant XML format.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.680
As you can see here, the categories
are the individual patient level,

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.190
which could be a list of encounter dates
for that patient, patient lists, which

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.270
could be all the diabetic patients in a
provider's practice, or aggregated data,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.500
which could be the average hemoglobin
A1c for all the diabetics in a practice.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.880
We'll discuss QRDA and
other related standards,

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.420
such as the format for
the queries themselves, in Lesson 9.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.960
For now it's just a standard vehicle for
reporting the results of population or

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.290
public health queries.
