&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Hi I'm Heather with the
Cinema Club here at Google LA.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:08.280
And we're real excited to welcome Jerry Zucker.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.179
Of course, we're gonna have the other two
directors come but they couldn't make it at

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:12.179
the last minute.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.480
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Ahhh
&gt;&gt;audience member: Yay Jerry!

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.689
[applause and cheers]

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:19.339
&gt;&gt; presenter: We're really grateful and honored
to have him.

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:21.400
&gt;&gt;Jerry: They don't really like you.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.400
[laughter]

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.730
&gt;&gt; presenter: And some of the movies that
all three of them did.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.730
Obviously "Airplane."

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.730
But "Top Secret."

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.119
They did the "Naked Gun" series.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.820
And "Ruthless People."

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.860
Jerry's films that he's directed include "Ghost",
"First Night" and "Rat Race" and maybe you

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.840
have others that you wanna talk about as well.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.800
And so please join me in welcoming Jerry Zucker.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.680
[applause and cheers]

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.539
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Ah.

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.800
Thank you it's a pleasure to, pleasure to
be here.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.570
This is an amazing, I this is an amazing workspace.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.760
I don't know how any of you get anything done.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.760
[laughter]

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.050
I mean, it's like, it's every ten feed it's
either an exercise place or an eating place

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.130
or a you know, gathering place.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.130
But anyway.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.130
So.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.130
What?

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.940
&gt;&gt;male audience member: We gotta put it on
and work it off.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.940
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Exactly.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.670
No, no, but it's pretty amazing.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.020
You all probably know how lucky you are, to
have a place like that.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.020
I mean, I don't know how.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.920
They might beat the crap out of you while
you're working.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.420
[laughing] You know.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.230
But the building is great.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.740
Actually, we were all supposed to be here
today.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:39.820
I apologize for Jim.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.070
He had to go to a conference.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:49.790
He's, Jim is very involved with pediatric
epilepsy and he went to a, he left, he had

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.630
an emergency meeting in Chicago I think.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.130
Or somewhere.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.280
About this conference that they're holding.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.520
Anyway, and I talked to my brother David today
and he was "Ah, Jerry" [imitating brother].

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.130
So that didn't work out.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.549
I guess I'll really mostly wanna answer your
questions.

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:20.040
I'll just, I guess, talk a little bit about
this film.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.159
It started when we were doing this thing called
Kentucky Fried Theater.

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:33.549
And Kentucky Fried Theater was live skits
and also we had a video monitor.

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:39.969
This was really in the early days of video
with reel-to-reel video in this big machine.

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.189
It's like this big.

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:47.940
And it is amazing 'cause the machine was like
this big, and half inch reel-to-reel and really

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.940
heavy.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.150
And a big cord tethered to a camera.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.409
And it was black and white and not nearly
as good as my iPhone.

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:56.409
You know.

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:57.609
In terms of picture quality.

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.989
[laughter] So it's hard to imagine how they,
how you do that.

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:08.950
But the, so we used to set the video tape
machine to go on in the middle of the night

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.060
where some of the corniest commercials were.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.909
'Cause we would do spoofs on them.

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:20.040
And one night we caught this movie called
"Zero Hour" which is this 1957 flying movie

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.840
with Dana Andrews, Sterling Hayden, Elroy
Hirsch, being some fairly well known names

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.840
at the time.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.299
They probably don't mean a lot to you now
but--.

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:36.489
And we were looking at the commercials but
then we kinda got engrossed in the movie.

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:45.659
And the interesting thing about this movie
and the whole genre, it kind of was that we

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.299
made fun of it.

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:48.780
But we also loved it.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.780
You know?

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.090
And that sort of, everything we did in terms
of satire, we had to have both.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.629
We had to find it laughable and we also had
to have some affection for it.

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:04.040
And I think you can kind of see that in "Airplane."

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:10.530
And a lot, you know, for us it was this really
tough, hard-hitting style of drama that we

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.920
grew up with.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.169
Both on TV and in the movies.

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:18.570
The B movies in particular.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.230
And the Charlton Heston school, whatever.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.230
Anyway.

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.390
And so we said "Gee, maybe we should make,
this would make a funny movie."

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:32.320
And so we didn't really know a lot about writing
movies.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:40.410
But we took, the three of us, while we were
doing the show, or, were working on it.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.450
And then we put it down for a while 'cause
we couldn't.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.220
We finished it but we couldn't get it going.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.010
Interestingly enough, someone offered to buy
it.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.880
But we didn't wanna sell it 'cause we didn't
trust anybody to do it right.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.750
And even when we were nothing, we had, we
didn't have anything.

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.952
And I think someone was offering us a couple
hundred thousand dollars or something if it

00:05:00.952 --> 00:05:03.040
got made, and that may have been a lot of
money.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.670
But we grew to love it and we didn't want
anybody to mess it up.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.500
Particularly the casting which was probably
the most important thing to us.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.820
Well, two things.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.010
They're part of the same thing.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.280
The casting and the tone.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:22.460
To play it totally straight.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:28.120
When we were on the set we used to, and when
we spoke with the actors before we hired them,

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.790
we told them "We don't want you to play it
straight.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.980
We want you to pretend that you don't know
you're in a comedy."

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:35.980
And there's a difference.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.060
'Cause when you say "play it straight", a
lot of people kinda think they're playing

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.170
it straight.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:46.450
But really they're, it's for the actor it's
about still about them being funny.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.420
And them making people laugh.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.640
And we really, that's what we really wanted
to reign in.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:55.500
You act like you have no idea that this is
funny.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.500
[laughter]

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.280
That you think you're doing a serious movie.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.570
And that's kinda why we just didn't trust
anybody.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.450
And insisted on directing it when we finally
did get to Paramount.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.410
And they said "OK."

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.440
They said they liked the script.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:16.790
They tried to, they brought up names of current
movie directors that were established successful

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:20.490
directors and wanted someone else to direct
it.

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:25.800
And we kind of said, no, we need to do that.

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.810
It was really for that reason, not that we
thought we were gonna be great directors.

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:37.430
But we just, this was our baby and even the--.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.200
Every studio in town turned it down until
we got to Paramount.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:47.760
And Michael Eisner was having dinner with
a woman named Susan Baerwald, who was a reader

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.450
at United Artists.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:55.740
And he said "What have you read recently that
you like?"

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.190
And she said "Well, there's this one script,
'Airplane'."

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:06.710
And she described the film to him and said
"I sent it through with high recommendations

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.630
and they passed on it."

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:14.290
And Eisner got up from the table, called Jeff
Katzenberg and said "Track this thing down."

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:19.790
'Cause he just thought that sounded, a comedy
on an airplane, was a great idea.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:24.080
And the idea that it was low budget.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.530
[laughter]

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.670
And so they were great.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:31.990
And they were helpful.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.020
And there's another interesting thing.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.970
Eisner insisted, we had written it to be done
on a prop plane.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:40.140
Because that's what "Zero Hour" was.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.790
And in fact I think we wanted to do it black
and white, even.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.810
Because we were so, we were too into that
whole thing.

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:51.760
And Eisner, to his credit, said "No."

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:59.610
Well what he said was, he said "You can do
it in black and white and with a prop plane

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:02.400
but not at this studio."

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.200
[laughter]

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:12.290
But I always, I've talked to him recently
and I always thank him.

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.430
He was absolutely right about that.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:20.550
And, but what they never really quite, the
casting.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:25.840
They said "OK, OK, you can have Nielsen and
Bridges and Stack."

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.890
'Cause we were very insistent about that.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.890
But they wanted to put a lot of comedy cameos
in it.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:39.079
People from, actors that were on TV shows
at the time, on the lot Robin Williams, and

00:08:39.079 --> 00:08:48.009
Penny Marshall, and all the Paramount TV show
people, and others.

00:08:48.009 --> 00:08:51.000
And, which we didn't really wanna do.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.209
But we went through this process and fortunately
we had this great, one of the producers Howard

00:08:55.209 --> 00:08:56.209
W. Koch.

00:08:56.209 --> 00:08:57.959
He's not with us anymore.

00:08:57.959 --> 00:08:59.540
Wonderful, great guy.

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:04.759
Who at first we thought "Gee, the studio put
him on" and we thought "Ah, do we really want

00:09:04.759 --> 00:09:06.959
this old guy on this movie."

00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:11.350
And, of course, at the time he was the age
I am now.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:12.949
[laughter]

00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:14.529
But he was terrific.

00:09:14.529 --> 00:09:16.699
And he would call--.

00:09:16.699 --> 00:09:20.230
He got what we wanted to do.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:25.120
And so he would call agents and say "You know
what, I'm offering your client this script.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.910
But it's not really gonna be any good."

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.410
[laughter]

00:09:30.410 --> 00:09:31.410
And they would pass.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.540
And the only one that we ended up with out
of those is Jimmy Walker.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.139
Who is, you know, with the big thing.

00:09:36.139 --> 00:09:37.629
Which was fine.

00:09:37.629 --> 00:09:43.280
But it wasn't until the first day of dailies
that we got a call from the studio and they

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:50.399
said, and that was the first day of shooting
was Leslie Neilsen in the cockpit saying "I

00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:51.399
am serious.

00:09:51.399 --> 00:09:52.399
And don't call me Shirley."

00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:55.220
Among other things.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.269
And they said "Oh, now we get it."

00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:58.269
[laughter]

00:09:58.269 --> 00:10:03.200
They really, and I have to say, I don't call
anybody.

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:09.870
Most people really didn't get that and I don't
think, I don't you know ridicule people for

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:14.630
that because it was a difficult concept to
catch, to understand.

00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:17.389
Until you really saw how it played.

00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:22.550
And for us, this was something we had done
in our videos.

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:25.559
Even with younger actors, just playing it.

00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:27.110
Not famous of course.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.120
Just playing it straight.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.709
So it, we were, we had a great experience.

00:10:33.709 --> 00:10:38.360
It was helpful for us that we were this little
three million dollar movie.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:44.209
And at the same time, they were dealing with
the first Star Trek movie.

00:10:44.209 --> 00:10:45.670
Which was going way over budget.

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:48.649
So they didn't pay any attention to us.

00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:49.649
[laughter]

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:52.490
Which is great and we got the movie made.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:54.379
The first screening was a disaster.

00:10:54.379 --> 00:10:58.460
I mean, they brought in, we, it was longer.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:01.329
This movie now is 97 minutes.

00:11:01.329 --> 00:11:08.009
And I think, and the first one was probably
an hour and 50 minutes.

00:11:08.009 --> 00:11:14.069
We just sort of, you know, your first screenings
generally are long and then you.

00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:20.420
With satires we go into every movie hoping
that we have 90 minutes that are funny.

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:25.040
But you're always surprised.

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.449
And that first screening is always the scariest.

00:11:28.449 --> 00:11:29.490
You know?

00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:34.589
But in this case, and we hadn't had, it was
the first film we directed, so we hadn't had

00:11:34.589 --> 00:11:35.920
a lot of experience with that.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:43.529
But the guy whose job it was to recruit, they
insisted on doing it on the lot.

00:11:43.529 --> 00:11:47.939
The guy didn't do a great job of recruiting.

00:11:47.939 --> 00:11:54.600
It, to his defense, it's not that easy to
recruit an audience of people for a comedy

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.920
starring Robert Stack.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.760
[laughter] And Leslie Neilsen and Jeffrey
Green.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.240
Lloyd Bridges and Peter Graves.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:08.660
So they ended up dragging people off the line
from "Mork and Mindy" and "Happy Days" and

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.170
all of whatever they were shooting.

00:12:10.170 --> 00:12:14.420
And they just, they were, they just weren't
laughing.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:15.899
Except for one guy.

00:12:15.899 --> 00:12:23.410
It was one guy in the audience that "Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha"
He just loved it.

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:24.790
He just kept laughing.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:28.910
And bless him on beyond, you know a lot of
times people don't like to laugh if everybody

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:29.910
else isn't.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:30.910
But this guy didn't care.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:34.759
He's just "Wah-ha-haaaa".

00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:37.139
And we edited off of one guy.

00:12:37.139 --> 00:12:38.199
[laughter]

00:12:38.199 --> 00:12:45.749
You know, you really, you usually try to figure
you want a representative.

00:12:45.749 --> 00:12:47.430
You want 300 people.

00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:49.009
500 to get a sense.

00:12:49.009 --> 00:12:50.910
'Cause everybody doesn't laugh and.

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.369
One guy.

00:12:52.369 --> 00:12:53.720
[laughter]

00:12:53.720 --> 00:13:00.459
So then, the, afterwards, people were coming,
studio people.

00:13:00.459 --> 00:13:02.009
And "Well, now, I guess you got a lot of work
here."

00:13:02.009 --> 00:13:07.610
And we could see the "Failure!" in their eyes.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.820
[laughter] Actually I should say there was
a screening before that.

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:17.949
That was a funny, the first time we showed
it to the studio, we showed it to Eisner and

00:13:17.949 --> 00:13:20.290
I think Katzenberg, too.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.100
And we showed it at Eisner's house, in his
screening room.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.910
Of course you're not looking for big laughs.

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:30.160
'Cause it's just a couple of guys who've read
the script, seen the dailies, etcetera, etcetera.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:37.449
But his kids who were younger at the time,
were, I don't know, 8 and 10 or 12, whatever.

00:13:37.449 --> 00:13:41.300
They were in the projection booth and you
could hear them laughing through the projection

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.300
booth.

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.850
And Eisner, to his credit, he always had faith.

00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:47.850
You know?

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:58.170
And even when all these people said what some
of the other studio executives came out and

00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.170
said.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:00.170
More.

00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:01.170
You know.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:02.170
Negative things.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:06.019
And some who never liked the script and whatever,
were kind of saying, "I was right."

00:14:06.019 --> 00:14:10.220
Eisner and Katzenberg always had faith in
it.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:20.019
And so we've always, you know, had a debt
of gratitude towards them.

00:14:20.019 --> 00:14:22.720
No matter how much they tried to fuck us in
the future.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.720
[laughter]

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.890
No, no I'm kidding.

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.390
It's, you know.

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:30.390
[laughter]

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:34.319
Well, they're our studio executives, you know
what I mean?

00:14:34.319 --> 00:14:35.319
[laughter]

00:14:35.319 --> 00:14:39.350
Lemme just tell you right now, Paramount didn't
have a masseuse on duty.

00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:47.050
It's not like Google where "We want the employees
to be happy."

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.279
[laughter]

00:14:48.279 --> 00:14:51.310
"A happy worker is a productive worker."

00:14:51.310 --> 00:15:00.430
That wasn't the, you could be, what Paramount,
the studios are more the 'you could be fired

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:03.139
tomorrow' method of encouragement.

00:15:03.139 --> 00:15:04.179
[laughter]

00:15:04.179 --> 00:15:13.029
Anyway, so we finally decided we would, we
need to edit this.

00:15:13.029 --> 00:15:17.589
our next screening would be on a college campus.

00:15:17.589 --> 00:15:21.809
And we went, where was the first screening?

00:15:21.809 --> 00:15:28.629
I think it was, oh gee, somewhere, a UC campus.

00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:30.380
And forgive me, I can't think.

00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.649
Davis, maybe it was.

00:15:32.649 --> 00:15:36.230
And that was like, exhilarating.

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.019
Because they just loved it.

00:15:38.019 --> 00:15:39.230
We, it was better edited, too.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.980
Because thanks to that one guy.

00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.199
[laughter] I should have gotten his name.

00:15:44.199 --> 00:15:45.670
I should really.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:48.009
Still I'd like to call him and thank him.

00:15:48.009 --> 00:15:52.569
But then we did a bunch of college campus
screenings.

00:15:52.569 --> 00:15:56.160
And those were just great.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:02.350
And then, there's just nothing worse than
spending years of your life on a movie and

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.759
feeling like it's bombing.

00:16:03.759 --> 00:16:12.209
And it's really, it's, we all have a lot of,
I don't know if it's the same in your business

00:16:12.209 --> 00:16:13.209
exactly.

00:16:13.209 --> 00:16:20.220
But for filmmakers, we have so much of our
own personal whatever tied up in it.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:25.550
And own egos and worth and all of that kind
of stuff.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.220
That it really, it's hard.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.230
You have to learn not to "zzzz-zzzz-zzzz"
you know.

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:36.239
Because that's the way the business is for
most people.

00:16:36.239 --> 00:16:40.749
But it, you know, those screenings were great.

00:16:40.749 --> 00:16:46.220
And then pretty much from there it was fairly
smooth.

00:16:46.220 --> 00:16:50.220
And then it came one, it was a hit.

00:16:50.220 --> 00:17:00.449
But oddly enough, it's funny, I don't think
when we made it then, we ever thought it would

00:17:00.449 --> 00:17:02.850
still be around 30 years later.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:03.850
[laughter]

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.319
And people would still, you know what I mean.

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:08.480
And of course we didn't know about, that was
before video.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:13.189
In those days, a movie had a second release.

00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:15.920
Or a re-release.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:20.370
And so they would like six months later, if
a movie was successful enough, they'd put

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:22.760
it out in theaters again for people who'd
missed it.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:30.970
And then it was just the television, a few
networks that would periodically maybe show

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:32.179
a movie.

00:17:32.179 --> 00:17:37.809
But there was some movies kind of died off
unless they were like "Wizard of Oz" or some,

00:17:37.809 --> 00:17:41.029
"Gone with the Wind" the big movies.

00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:48.830
But thanks to video, and DVD now, these things
live.

00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:52.169
And so it's amazing.

00:17:52.169 --> 00:18:00.890
That this thing that we did when we were kids
with, you know.

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:06.919
Sort of carried this, it's almost become more
now than it was then.

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:07.919
In a way.

00:18:07.919 --> 00:18:08.919
It's hard for me to gauge.

00:18:08.919 --> 00:18:09.919
'Cause I'm inside it.

00:18:09.919 --> 00:18:13.210
But it feels like, I mean, people liked it
then.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:14.779
And it was like "Oh, that was cool."

00:18:14.779 --> 00:18:21.170
But I just, I didn't feel then quite like
the god I do know.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:26.120
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;male #1: We're not worthy, we're not worthy

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.970
[laughs]
&gt;&gt;Jerry: [laughing] Thank you, thank you.

00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:33.620
No, it has taken on a, I think a different
aura.

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:36.990
But anyway, so that's like a quick overview.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.010
But I'll, so I'd love to answer questions.

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:41.010
Any questions you have.

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:42.010
Go ahead.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:45.070
&gt;&gt;male #1: My roommate and I are great fans
of all your movies of course.

00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:46.789
And also of "Police Squad".

00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:47.789
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Ah.

00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:51.600
&gt;&gt;male #1: And I gotta ask, "Police Squad"
obviously led into "Naked Gun."

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.670
But I wonder what happened that we only have
what?

00:18:54.670 --> 00:19:00.870
Half a dozen of this absolutely among the
funniest television ever.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:01.870
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Thank you.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:07.440
You know it was a funny thing about "Police
Squad."

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:16.840
We had this, we insisted right off the bat
that there not be a laugh track.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:20.240
And so ABC said "OK", you know.

00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.350
They wanted to do the show.

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:28.850
And we got into it and when it was done they
begged us to put a laugh track on it.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:34.110
We had contractually, we had "You can't do
this without our permission."

00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:38.500
And so because the thing is, about that kinda
humor, the whole thing is you're pretending

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.730
it's not funny.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:47.799
And so when we finished the first show, they
wanted us to, they put a laugh track on.

00:19:47.799 --> 00:19:52.370
Not that they thought they'd sneak something
by, but they asked us, "Please just look at

00:19:52.370 --> 00:19:53.370
it.

00:19:53.370 --> 00:19:54.980
Because we think it plays much better."

00:19:54.980 --> 00:20:00.429
And we said "No, this is not our humor."

00:20:00.429 --> 00:20:02.790
But you know, for television they may have
been right.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:05.760
For our show, we were right.

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:08.130
And so we never regretted the decision.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:13.500
But I think the real telling thing was that
Tony Thermopolis when he canceled it, said

00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.890
it didn't work because you had to watch it.

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:16.890
[laughter]

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:19.360
&gt;&gt;audience member: You had to focus.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:20.360
&gt;&gt;Jerry: You had to focus.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.510
And it's true, we made it like a film.

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:27.600
Like, people sit in a darkened room facing
the screen and paying attention.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:35.019
And with television, kind of, you're doing
other, but now you're texting on your phone,

00:20:35.019 --> 00:20:36.230
you're doing all kinds of things.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:40.720
In those days it was, still you're getting
up to get something to eat or you've got a

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:42.850
newspaper or you're talking to some people.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:43.850
Whatever.

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:50.679
You're just not, and I actually heard you
know, at the time people would tell me when

00:20:50.679 --> 00:20:55.190
college students would say, they would all
get together in the dorm at the, in the lounge

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:56.480
or whatever.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:00.690
And 50 or more would watch it together and
it would play great.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.090
Because then it played like a movie in a way.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:09.500
And it also is the kinda thing that it always
helps to have an audience for something like

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.500
that.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:14.990
So watching at home without a laugh track,
I don't know.

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:24.760
But for us, we had mixed feelings about it
being canceled because on the one hand, you

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.150
don't like to fail at anything.

00:21:27.150 --> 00:21:32.070
But on the other hand, we didn't, it was tough
to keep the quality up.

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:34.830
And I don't think we really quite did through
the whole thing.

00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:39.529
I mean, I thought was, from our perspective
it was a bit sporadic.

00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:42.130
Some great great stuff in it, but a little
bit sporadic.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:51.230
But when you consider you'd spend, we'd spend
a year to write a movie, and a year between

00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:53.990
preproduction and shooting and editing.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:57.010
So it's at least a two year process.

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:58.010
Making the thing.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:01.909
And here we're doing 24 minutes a week.

00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:05.860
And you have a little more than that 'cause
you start a little earlier and stuff.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:13.639
But it's still really, and you're shooting
and doing preproduction shooting, editing,

00:22:13.639 --> 00:22:15.100
all at once.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.570
It's a three ring circus.

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.799
Plus the fact that we couldnít direct them
all ourselves.

00:22:19.799 --> 00:22:25.130
We hired other people to direct it and that
was always kind of a mess because it's once

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:29.630
again, our sense of humor.

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:32.360
That kind of satire is just very specific.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:36.679
So it was hard to just find someone else who
could go in and do that.

00:22:36.679 --> 00:22:41.500
And we were not good producers for directors,
in that case.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.200
'Cause we would be saying "No, no, no."

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:46.570
We would be stepping in all the time.

00:22:46.570 --> 00:22:49.460
And sort of directing.

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:50.730
And anyway.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:54.870
&gt;&gt;male #2: First of all, "Airplane."

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:58.980
&gt;&gt;Jerry: I'll repeat it: First of all, "Airplane."

00:22:58.980 --> 00:22:59.980
[laughter]

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:04.580
&gt;&gt;male#2: Repeat after me, was one of the
greatest, is one of the greatest comic films

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:05.580
ever made.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:06.580
Repeat that.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.580
[applause]

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:08.580
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Well, thank you.

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:12.340
&gt;&gt;male #2: Without a doubt, absolutely one
of the greatest comedy films ever made.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.620
&gt;&gt;Jerry: What you mean, "One of?"

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.370
&gt;&gt;male #2: Well, it is, it is, it is in its
own category

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:17.370
&gt;&gt;Jerry: One of how many?

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:18.370
A thousand?

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:19.370
No, I'm kidding, go ahead.

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:20.370
[laughter]

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:23.380
&gt;&gt;male #2: It is in its own category and was
followed by many unfunny films.

00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.380
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Yeah.

00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:25.380
&gt;&gt;male #2: That have tried to follow in that
footstep that are not even close.

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:31.230
You go there and you look at them and you
say "Why are these even funny and why do people

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:36.000
think they're funny because they're not and
they're not even the same category with Airplane."

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Bless you.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.860
&gt;&gt;male #2: So yes, it's wonderful to have
all these years later to sit down with you,

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.820
and say that this is where you belong for
another hundred years.

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:44.820
&gt;&gt;Jerry: You're so smart.

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:45.820
I didn't

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:46.820
[laughter]

00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.240
&gt;&gt;male #2: Well, it's in such great company.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.240
One of the

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.850
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Well, I mean I knew Google was kind
of a bright company.

00:23:52.850 --> 00:23:53.850
It had to be.

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:55.740
But this is beyond what I ever imagined.

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:57.480
&gt;&gt;male #2: Wait until later.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.279
You'll be "Google, what are you talking about?"

00:24:00.279 --> 00:24:02.600
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Particularly the way you're dressed,
I didn't expect.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.600
Anyway.

00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:04.600
[laughter]

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:09.730
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Google people don't worry about
it, but anyway.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.799
Three million dollars you say was the budget.

00:24:12.799 --> 00:24:17.769
It absolutely, I'm sure, held you back from
having complete and total control to do anything

00:24:17.769 --> 00:24:19.790
in the world that you'd wanna do.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:23.410
And it looked like that came across as more
ingenuity.

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:30.340
Do you feel that you were more creative under
the limitations that you had at that time?

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:35.472
Versus today where 50 million would be what
you'd put on the screen there and it would

00:24:35.472 --> 00:24:40.170
look incredibly polished but probably not
be a tenth as good of a film.

00:24:40.170 --> 00:24:43.750
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Well, that's a good point, you're
exactly right.

00:24:43.750 --> 00:24:51.571
There is sometimes, you know, I never want
to say this to a studio, but there is some

00:24:51.571 --> 00:24:55.750
creativity gained to a lower budget.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:57.970
Having to do things for less money.

00:24:57.970 --> 00:25:03.070
And by the way, it depends upon the kind of
movie you're making.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:12.769
I mean, if you're making one of these special
effects movies with a huge landscape, then

00:25:12.769 --> 00:25:16.870
I don't know if Avatar would have been helped
by a smaller budget.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:18.130
[laughter]

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:25.040
But, the, for us, first of all, we kinda,
at that point, I mean we've always had, you

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.250
always have budget arguments with studios.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:32.169
And hopefully you arrive at something that
you can work with.

00:25:32.169 --> 00:25:35.049
At the time, for us, we didn't even get--.

00:25:35.049 --> 00:25:36.679
The number meant nothing to us.

00:25:36.679 --> 00:25:38.549
I mean three million dollars seemed like a
lot.

00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:43.600
That's a lot of money.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.750
And we were just thrilled to get out there
and make the movie.

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:52.320
And we, Jon Davison, who is one of the producers
who is, and Howard Koch.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:57.480
We just trust that they kind of, they would
just say "OK, you've gotta do this.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:01.640
Shoot this scene in a half a day and this
scene and do you think you can do this and

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.640
that.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.410
And if not, then how can we switch around?"

00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:10.780
And so, you know, we didn't know in those
days, we were too naive to know that you could

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.520
actually just go over budget.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.159
[laughter]

00:26:15.159 --> 00:26:17.480
And so we were actually stupid fools.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.580
We were actually hustling trying to make our
days.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:20.580
Pshh.

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:21.580
Anyway.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.580
So.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.240
No, we, of course, still do that.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:29.799
But there is, you know, there's another element.

00:26:29.799 --> 00:26:37.250
And one thing, there is a certain creativity
to, an energy to moving fast.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:43.020
But also that's also actually one great thing
about shooting digitally.

00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:45.760
Because you can shoot endlessly.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.340
You don't need to yell "Cut!"

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:52.009
You can just, and the actors love it because
it keeps up that energy.

00:26:52.009 --> 00:26:56.659
So you know, just moving fast I think kinda
sometimes does the same thing.

00:26:56.659 --> 00:27:03.190
But there's another aspect to this particular
film in that, I mean, there's, we like the

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:04.190
cheesiness.

00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:05.190
You know?

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:11.620
It wouldn't have been, I don't think, certainly
not any better and probably not as good if

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.620
it had been too slick.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:16.900
I mean, we liked the, we were imitating a
certain style.

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:21.410
So we liked the fact that you could almost
see the strings on the plane.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:22.410
[laughter]

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:25.029
You know, it's just kinda hanging there.

00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:35.270
And it so that, and I think you're also right,
there's on some level, there's actually an

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:38.679
appreciation to doing that.

00:27:38.679 --> 00:27:39.679
So anyway.

00:27:39.679 --> 00:27:42.909
&gt;&gt;male #3: So the other night I was watching
" Enter the Dragon" with my teenage son.

00:27:42.909 --> 00:27:44.929
And couldn't keep a straight face.

00:27:44.929 --> 00:27:50.220
Because my parents ill-advisedly took me to
see "Kentucky Fried Movie" when it came out.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.289
And I was just hoping

00:27:51.289 --> 00:27:53.820
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Your face isn't that straight anyway
right now.

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:54.820
If I can comment.

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:55.820
No, sorry, go ahead.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:58.500
&gt;&gt;male #3: So I was hoping you could talk
a little about "Kentucky Fried Theater" and

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.360
the origin of that film.

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:06.710
&gt;&gt;Jerry: OK, well, "Kentucky Fried Theater",
we were all at the university in Madison,

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:07.860
University of Wisconsin.

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.419
My brother, and Jim Abrams and I.

00:28:11.419 --> 00:28:14.309
And we started this theater.

00:28:14.309 --> 00:28:20.090
Actually we had seen this thing called "Groove
Tube" which was this guy named Ken Shapiro

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:22.970
got a hold of, had some video tape equipment.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:27.000
And he made some, a bunch of funny videos.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.669
And what he would do is rent a theater.

00:28:30.669 --> 00:28:37.289
And do some advertising, and you'd come in
and there'd be you know, these bunch of chairs

00:28:37.289 --> 00:28:39.470
in front of a television monitor.

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:41.809
Or a few monitors around.

00:28:41.809 --> 00:28:47.379
And he'd actually put a couple refrigerators
in there where you could go up and get a soda

00:28:47.379 --> 00:28:48.379
or something.

00:28:48.379 --> 00:28:54.190
And the idea though was that it was stuff
that you couldn't, it was TV but that you

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:55.399
couldn't see on TV.

00:28:55.399 --> 00:28:58.580
'Cause this was before cable.

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.960
And so television was pretty chaste.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:07.620
But this, these were all spoofs and some of
them were pretty scatological.

00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:11.149
And R-rated and whatever.

00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:16.980
And you know, we thought, "Well just, we can
do this."

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:27.450
Actually, my, the story prior to this, a family
friend, a friend of my parents, worked, there

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:31.129
was a, had a sickroom service company.

00:29:31.129 --> 00:29:35.450
Where they rented out wheelchairs and that
kinda thing.

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:44.120
And he had this video tape machine that he
would use to demonstrate some of the stuff.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.820
And my father thought.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:52.450
He said "I talked to Bill and he said he would
let you use this" He's talking to my brother

00:29:52.450 --> 00:29:56.720
now who was older and already had graduated
and at the time was working for my dad as

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.269
a construction expediter.

00:29:58.269 --> 00:30:03.789
Anyway, he said "You know, you can use this
and you can make industrial videos."

00:30:03.789 --> 00:30:07.710
'Cause he knew David wanted to get into something
with, you know film.

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:11.610
And industrial videos were not exactly what
David had in mind.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:22.049
[chuckles] But then when David saw this "Groove
Tube" thing, he drove all the way from Chicago.

00:30:22.049 --> 00:30:23.789
He saw it in Chicago.

00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:25.750
Drove up to Madison.

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:27.179
And started talking a mile a minute.

00:30:27.179 --> 00:30:28.220
"Jerry, we gotta do this.

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:29.220
Da da dad a da.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.470
This we can do."

00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:38.429
So we got a hold of the video tape equipment
and actually David just ran into Jim Abrams

00:30:38.429 --> 00:30:39.710
in Milwaukee.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:44.529
And Jim at the time was working as a private
investigator for a law firm.

00:30:44.529 --> 00:30:45.559
[laughter]

00:30:45.559 --> 00:30:53.629
And he, and the three of us found ourselves
in the basement of our house with this video

00:30:53.629 --> 00:30:55.700
tape equipment.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:56.929
And just having a blast.

00:30:56.929 --> 00:31:01.210
And it was the greatest thing because, you
know, you could even though it was that machine

00:31:01.210 --> 00:31:04.080
I described earlier, in black and white then.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.470
But you could play it back right away.

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:07.420
You didn't have to send it out to be developed.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:12.639
And there was no cost to it, you know, unless
you bought another reel of tape.

00:31:12.639 --> 00:31:14.110
But even that wasn't very much.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:15.110
And you could erase it.

00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:19.080
And it was just like, we had a, we just had
a blast.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.100
And we laughed and it was the most fun thing.

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:28.470
And then at some point we said, well, "We
gotta show this to people."

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:32.389
We did show, we collected a reel of these
funny things we'd done.

00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:33.860
We showed the people and they laughed.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.940
We said "OK, we gotta do something, we gotta
put this."

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:40.139
It's like Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland "Hey,
let's do a show!"

00:31:40.139 --> 00:31:45.630
So anyway, it's a long story but finally we
got it all together.

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:46.929
We opened at University of Wisconsin.

00:31:46.929 --> 00:31:52.020
There were a bunch of live skits and then
a bunch of video tape and a little bit of

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.120
film stuff.

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.700
And it was just anything goes, this was 1970.

00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:02.720
And it was just at the time that it was OK
to laugh again.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.730
Because this is just post-Vietnam.

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:10.700
Protests and everything at that time was very
political.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:11.700
The Committee.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:12.700
The Second City.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.620
These groups would do a lot of political material.

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.919
And we were just, you know, zany.

00:32:18.919 --> 00:32:22.899
We didn't do any political material, really.

00:32:22.899 --> 00:32:27.370
And got skewered for that occasionally in
reviews.

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:33.960
You know, but basically the show was a success
We weren't making a lot of money on it, but

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.450
enough to buy more equipment.

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:37.360
But we all had other, I was in school.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:44.429
And Jim and David had jobs and stuff, and
so for, we, at some point it became not just

00:32:44.429 --> 00:32:45.429
a lark.

00:32:45.429 --> 00:32:48.570
But like, you know, we're really into this.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:49.570
You know?

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:50.889
And we gotta, we don't wanna stop this.

00:32:50.889 --> 00:32:52.590
But we can't make a living from it here.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:55.039
So let's go to Los Angeles.

00:32:55.039 --> 00:32:57.779
So we packed up everything in a big U-Haul
truck.

00:32:57.779 --> 00:33:01.450
The boards from the stage, the costumes, the
wiring.

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:04.059
And we moved out to Los Angeles.

00:33:04.059 --> 00:33:05.520
And did the show there.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:11.149
And so now to skip to the movie.

00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:12.929
Actually when we first came to Los Angeles.

00:33:12.929 --> 00:33:14.120
We didn't know what we wanted to be.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:16.529
I mean, a performing group.

00:33:16.529 --> 00:33:17.529
Television.

00:33:17.529 --> 00:33:18.529
Writers.

00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:22.749
I don't think we ever thought of ourselves
really so much as directors.

00:33:22.749 --> 00:33:26.950
We turned to that sort of because we wanted
control of our material.

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:32.350
But not because we were like born to do that.

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:35.210
Which is pretty obvious if you look at any
of our movies.

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:36.260
[laughter]

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:44.419
But we you know, at some point we said "OK,
film really is our media.

00:33:44.419 --> 00:33:50.799
It's where we can take time and I don't know,
it's just, you know we're not that prolific.

00:33:50.799 --> 00:33:54.289
We really like to take time to get.

00:33:54.289 --> 00:33:57.620
We wanna be able to take the time to get it
right and have something that would last and

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:00.909
not just, you know.

00:34:00.909 --> 00:34:02.450
Disappear after a week."

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:03.450
Or whatever.

00:34:03.450 --> 00:34:13.329
So we, David saw John Landis, who directed
"Animal House" and "The Blues brothers", those

00:34:13.329 --> 00:34:14.329
films.

00:34:14.329 --> 00:34:17.169
But this was just after his first movie "Schlock"
and he was on the Tonight Show because he

00:34:17.169 --> 00:34:21.720
was a 21 year old kid who had directed a film.

00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:25.179
And David thought, geez, 21, maybe he'll talk
to us.

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:28.200
I mean, because we didn't know anybody still.

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:33.900
And we had done this all but we didn't, we
had, we didn't know anybody in the movie business.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:40.070
And so David called him and he was nice enough,
he invited him to the show.

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:42.550
He came to the show and we took him out to
lunch.

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:46.190
And I remember he gave us a, we said "How
do you write a movie script?"

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:52.819
And he gave us the script to "American Werewolf
in London" [laughter] which happened much

00:34:52.819 --> 00:34:54.089
later, you know.

00:34:54.089 --> 00:35:01.830
But we, so we used the form and that's when
we stared to write the first draft of "Airplane"

00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:09.701
and then when we couldn't get that going,
we decided that maybe a way to get a movie

00:35:09.701 --> 00:35:16.890
going was to do a really low budget film of
different bits.

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:20.380
And there had already, "Groove Tube" had done
that and been successful.

00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:24.300
So again we followed in the steps of "Groove
Tube."

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:27.510
Does that answer your question?

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:28.510
More than you ever wanted.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:29.510
Yeah, go ahead.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:30.510
[laughter]

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:35.050
&gt;&gt;male #4: I was gonna ask you since you directed
with the trio and by yourself.

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:36.309
Kind of, the differences.

00:35:36.309 --> 00:35:42.570
And what it's like to have three, directing
with two other people with you.

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:47.030
&gt;&gt;Jerry: When you direct by yourself you get
all of the credit and all of the blame.

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:48.030
[laughs]

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:52.059
But, and it actually is really good to share
both.

00:35:52.059 --> 00:35:53.230
Ironically.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:55.450
It's great.

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:57.400
In the days of success.

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.339
It was great to go "Alright!

00:36:00.339 --> 00:36:03.890
Guys!" because you can't just go out in public
and say "Hey!

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:06.110
I made that movie!" you know.

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:09.310
So it's just sort of, we had a, Dave and Jim
and I grew up together.

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:10.950
We were, Dave and I are brothers.

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:14.380
It was, you know, we had a, it was a great
trio.

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:18.180
Not that we didn't argue and you know, beat
each other up a little bit.

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.700
But we really, we loved each other.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:24.580
And we needed each other and it was great.

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:29.339
I think what happened is eventually, particularly
when we stopped doing satire.

00:36:29.339 --> 00:36:33.420
I mean "Ruthless People" was a little harder
'cause it was a comedy but it wasn't a satire.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:39.250
So there were more arguments 'cause that movie
could've gone in different directions.

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:41.520
Different filmmakers could've made different
films.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:50.670
Whereas "Airplane" or "Naked Gun", there was
really only one film to be made of that.

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:59.300
Anyway, so it, we, and also I think that when
we started we really didn't have the courage.

00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:04.119
I don't think we would have, I don't think
if either of us, any of us, had come out here

00:37:04.119 --> 00:37:09.220
alone we would have ever had the nerve to
direct a film on our own.

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:10.450
So it just took a while for us.

00:37:10.450 --> 00:37:13.930
Because like I said, we didn't come out like,
with, you know.

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:19.010
We, directing really takes sort of a lot of
kind of nerve.

00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:22.099
Or it takes some bravado.

00:37:22.099 --> 00:37:24.080
It takes some confidence.

00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.670
It, which we didn't have.

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:29.240
You know, individually, I don't think.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:33.809
And so but we did collectively.

00:37:33.809 --> 00:37:36.700
And so, but yeah.

00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:41.589
Directing alone, at some point, you kind of,
it is nice to make all the decisions.

00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:44.690
It is nice to make the film you wanna make.

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.941
And it's, you know it's a mixed thing.

00:37:46.941 --> 00:37:48.700
I mean, I do, I enjoy that.

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:55.840
And I've liked that experience but on the
other hand, I don't know, the three of us

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.130
was great.

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:58.160
You know?

00:37:58.160 --> 00:37:59.160
So.

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.589
It's they're both, it's both good.

00:38:02.589 --> 00:38:03.660
You have the mic, so go ahead.

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:07.490
&gt;&gt;male #5: One of the things I was struck
by watching you tonight was how well a lot,

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:09.030
so many of the jokes have held up.

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:11.990
And you were saying you didn't expect that
it would be around for decades.

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.990
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Yeah.

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:16.109
&gt;&gt;male #5: But did you consciously do this
mix of jokes?

00:38:16.109 --> 00:38:20.540
To really try to balance it between these
very period, very specific that you have to

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:23.240
get the reference versus, it seems incredibly
balanced.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.240
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Uh.

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.240
Yeah.

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.490
I don't think we did that purposefully.

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:29.619
I mean, 'cause we weren't t thinking.

00:38:29.619 --> 00:38:32.890
We just wanted people now to laugh.

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:37.230
[laughing] We weren't thinking about years
from now, you know.

00:38:37.230 --> 00:38:46.890
And, but I think that one of the reasons it
holds up is it's really a lot of it is just,

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:50.450
as I mentioned before, it's a satire on a
style of acting.

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:53.070
And so that kind of thing, holds up.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:58.349
The stuff that doesn't is, are the lines that
are specific to a commercial.

00:38:58.349 --> 00:39:00.359
Or a television show.

00:39:00.359 --> 00:39:01.490
Or a movie.

00:39:01.490 --> 00:39:02.490
You know.

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:06.500
And even some of the movies like the Saturday
Night Fever, you know.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.500
People.

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.579
That movie has held up.

00:39:09.579 --> 00:39:11.710
Is still with us on DVD.

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:16.809
So to the extent that we pick those movies,
we're alright.

00:39:16.809 --> 00:39:23.220
And I think a lot of times certain things
skirt by that even if you don't know the reference

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.820
it's, it passes.

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:26.820
You know.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.480
That joke is going along to the next.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:33.770
So but no, we, it wasn't something, it was
something that happened.

00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:37.059
But, and I agree with you, but it wasn't,
it was not purposeful.

00:39:37.059 --> 00:39:38.059
[laughter]

00:39:38.059 --> 00:39:43.450
&gt;&gt;male #6: Not to be over repetitive, but
I want to thank you very much for

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:44.450
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Over.

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:45.450
[chuckles]

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:46.710
&gt;&gt;male #6: "Airplane" and "Naked Gun" and
all, everything.

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:48.470
They were all depressingly formative for me.

00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:49.470
[laughter]

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:50.470
So.

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:51.470
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Yeah.

00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:52.470
I apologize, yes.

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:57.700
&gt;&gt;male #6: One thing that struck me when I
was watching was that you know, me and my

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:01.150
friends used to goof around because we watched
"Airplane" a lot.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:04.760
And make kind of spoofy home videos.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:08.480
And there were a lot of gags that seemed like
they were the kind of things we would have

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.480
added on the spot.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:12.990
Like, the mayo in the back of the Mayo Clinic,
was the kind of thing that some of us would

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:13.990
think of.

00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:16.349
Like, we're setting up the set "Well, why
don't we get as many jars of mayo as we can?"

00:40:16.349 --> 00:40:17.349
Or like, Johnny.

00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:18.349
And all his kind of antics.

00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:23.960
And I wanna know, how much of the humor was
there on the paper before you even got other

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:24.960
people involved?

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.200
And how much of it was just kind of spur of
the moment and "Oh, we can do this with what

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.200
we have."

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:33.309
&gt;&gt;Jerry: About 99 percent was scripted.

00:40:33.309 --> 00:40:38.880
It looks, it's nice that it looks like it's
and that's kind of the loose style of it in

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:39.880
a sense.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:41.109
Although it really isn't loose.

00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:51.120
But it, most of the script, even the stuff
that Johnny said.

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.430
But it's interesting.

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:59.569
That was a guy named Stephen Stucker who used
to be in our show in Kentucky Fried Theater

00:40:59.569 --> 00:41:01.230
in Los Angeles.

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:07.460
And he has his own particular style of humor
and we really couldn't write for him.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:14.370
And so [laughter] what we would do is, we
would call him up and we'd read him the setup

00:41:14.370 --> 00:41:15.370
line.

00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:17.220
And he'd just come up with the punch line.

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:18.220
[laughter]

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.770
You know.

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:23.170
And he was just really, is a very, he's just
like that.

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:24.170
I mean, that's Steve.

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:28.270
He's not this really serious guy who says
"Yes, I can play that character."

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:31.240
He's, this was kind of was him.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:38.060
So we'd say, "OK" say, "Well what does the
plane look like?" and he goes "Oh, it's like

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:39.070
a big Tylenol."

00:41:39.070 --> 00:41:41.540
And he'd say, you know.

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.280
And a couple lines were things from the show.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.670
"What can you make outta this?"

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:47.810
"Oh, I can make a hat or a brooch or a pin."

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:48.810
You know.

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:49.810
[laughter]

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:54.370
And so, it's you know, but yeah, it was scripted.

00:41:54.370 --> 00:41:59.549
In other words, when he said it, we liked
it because our feeling was, the things that

00:41:59.549 --> 00:42:06.640
would work were generally things that were,
had been in the script and stood the test

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:07.810
of time.

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:09.670
Because a lot of times the problem with improve.

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:15.320
Ach, it seems so funny at the moment, but
then, is it really funny the next day or the

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.320
next day?

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:19.400
And it's, a lot of times the answer is no.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:22.819
There was one thing I remember that was added.

00:42:22.819 --> 00:42:28.090
Was, we had the written in the script was
the slapping of the woman.

00:42:28.090 --> 00:42:30.099
Of this hysterical woman.

00:42:30.099 --> 00:42:31.520
But I think that was it.

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:35.630
He just slaps her and leaves her, maybe, and
then Leslie slaps her.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:41.160
But we added on the set, we added the thing
of all the other people waiting in line with

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:43.920
a gun and the whip and the whatever.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:49.750
So that's, that was, there were a couple things.

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:55.880
But really in all our films, particularly
the satires, were very.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:00.480
And we really were, wanted people to stick
to the script.

00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:04.440
We didn't, I think as long as you said that
no more questions I'll just keep talking,

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.440
OK.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.030
Because I didn't wanna.

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:08.809
You can, this is like, anyway.

00:43:08.809 --> 00:43:09.809
We can take one more.

00:43:09.809 --> 00:43:11.920
He had a question that he was just dying to
ask here.

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:12.920
OK, go ahead.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:13.920
[audience chattering]

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:17.480
I mean, I'm fine, if you're, I, don't wanna.

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:18.480
I don't know.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:20.900
You guys probably sleep here anyway right?

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:21.900
[laughter]

00:43:21.900 --> 00:43:24.510
&gt;&gt;male #7: It's kind of a half repeat of the
directing question

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:25.510
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Oh.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:27.150
&gt;&gt;male #7: about doing your first movie directing.

00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:30.890
But first I wanna say, I appreciate the many
levels of humor in "Airplane."

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:34.589
And, moving from silly to absolutely completely
silly.

00:43:34.589 --> 00:43:35.589
Probably

00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:36.589
[laughter]

00:43:36.589 --> 00:43:37.589
&gt;&gt;Jerry: A wide range.

00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:42.730
&gt;&gt;male #7: Probably a year or two ago on TCM,
they had a day of those airport movies.

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:44.260
They had "Zero Hour."

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:45.950
And there was one with John Wayne and Robert
Stack.

00:43:45.950 --> 00:43:48.580
I think it was called "House in the Sky" or
something.

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:49.580
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Uh.

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:50.580
"The High and the Mighty?"

00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:51.580
Or

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:52.580
&gt;&gt;male #7: Maybe.

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.099
It was all, it was like so "Airplane" as I
was watching it I realized.

00:43:55.099 --> 00:43:56.099
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Yeah, yeah.

00:43:56.099 --> 00:43:57.910
"The Crowded Sky."
&gt;&gt;male #7: Oh my God, Robert Stack!

00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:58.910
&gt;&gt;Jerry: There's a ton.

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:00.070
We watched all of them.

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:01.070
&gt;&gt;male #7: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:05.349
So I went back and I rewatched "Airplane"
after that and I just, I so appreciate the

00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:06.349
levels of it.

00:44:06.349 --> 00:44:08.589
'Cause when I first saw it I was like, eight.

00:44:08.589 --> 00:44:10.290
And had no idea there was this genre.

00:44:10.290 --> 00:44:11.790
The other thing I was just curious about

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:13.520
&gt;&gt;Jerry: You weren't into genres at eight?

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.520
[laughter]

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:15.520
&gt;&gt;male #7: Movie-lover for life.

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.810
But yeah, "The High and the Mighty."

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:19.609
It was amazing, it was hilarious.

00:44:19.609 --> 00:44:22.510
I went back and rented because of that.

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:23.510
But.

00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:24.510
&gt;&gt;female audience member: [inaudible]

00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:25.510
&gt;&gt;male #7: Oh, well, if you

00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:29.280
&gt;&gt;Jerry: If you look, if you ever have a chance
to go back and look, to watch "Zero Hour",

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.609
it's pretty shameless.

00:44:30.609 --> 00:44:33.410
Because there actually is a line where the.

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:39.359
I mean, the story, we bought the rights because
we took the story.

00:44:39.359 --> 00:44:40.579
We didn't know anything about plot.

00:44:40.579 --> 00:44:41.579
You know.

00:44:41.579 --> 00:44:42.579
[laughter]

00:44:42.579 --> 00:44:44.559
And so it actually, it has the same plot.

00:44:44.559 --> 00:44:50.290
It's a guy, in this case, in "Zero Hour" he's
chasing his wife who's leaving him because

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:54.290
he can't make a go of it because of what happened
during "The War".

00:44:54.290 --> 00:45:00.060
[laughter] Of course, in that movie there
actually was a war, that was, that he was

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:01.060
referring to.

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:08.569
But he, and there was, and then there's food
poisoning and the whole deal.

00:45:08.569 --> 00:45:13.130
But there actually is that line in that, in
"Zero Hour".

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:19.119
We took verbatim where he says "The life of
everybody on board this plane depends on just

00:45:19.119 --> 00:45:20.119
two things.

00:45:20.119 --> 00:45:24.069
Finding someone back there who not only can
fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for

00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:25.069
dinner."

00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:26.069
[laughter]

00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:29.869
You know, stole that verbatim.

00:45:29.869 --> 00:45:32.540
[laughter] Not a line changed.

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:38.020
And we, and it's just must be funny if I don't
know if Hall Bartlett who wrote that ever

00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:40.580
saw "Airplane".

00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:43.900
But it gets a big laugh in "Airplane" and
you know.

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:44.900
[laughter]

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:47.569
&gt;&gt;male #7: I was curious, too, about it being
your first time directing and the three of

00:45:47.569 --> 00:45:49.770
you, all three of you, your first time.

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:52.359
How much, if any, that you rehearsed?

00:45:52.359 --> 00:45:57.730
How did you approach the actors like Robert
Stack and Lloyd Bridges and said "Hey, we

00:45:57.730 --> 00:45:59.460
loved you in this" you know, that kind a thing?

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:04.030
And how was it, if what you remember of your
impressions directing it when you were actually

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:05.030
shooting.

00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:07.190
Were you guys crazy nervous or were you confident
by then?

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:08.520
Or was it a fun set?

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.130
Or was it really serious, or?

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:13.380
&gt;&gt;Jerry: I don't remember sleeping a lot the
night before the first day.

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:19.750
But it was, but we were, it was, I look at,
look back at it as one of the most fun experiences

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:22.020
in my career.

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:25.110
It was a, just exciting and a blast.

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:28.742
And not that any movie, you're always like,
"Oh my God, what are we gonna do.

00:46:28.742 --> 00:46:36.390
This isn't working" [inaudible] but you know,
but, the actors in terms of how we got them.

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:47.280
We, some, Howard Koch was helpful because
he sort of, you know, was respected.

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.270
And told these guys that we were OK.

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:51.480
A lot of them like Peter Graves really didn't.

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:58.940
He actually thought the script was atrocious
[laughter] And he, you know, but how I got

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:03.180
all these guys to meet, it was actually Peter
Graves' wife loved it.

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:05.790
And his kids thought it was great.

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:07.100
And they were sort of encouraging them.

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:09.010
And he said "Why do you want me?

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:10.319
Don't you want one of the big?

00:47:10.319 --> 00:47:11.319
Like Dom Delouise?

00:47:11.319 --> 00:47:15.480
Or one of the big comó" Well, you know, at
the time, he was a bit.

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:19.320
I don't know if that's the right name, but
whoever was in the Jack Lemmon.

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:20.320
I don't know.

00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:21.460
Walter Matthau.

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:22.460
Whatever.

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:27.670
But we said, we said "No, we think you'll
be funnier."

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:31.810
[laughs] And we explained that we just wanted
to play it straight.

00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:37.050
We wanted him to be just like he was in Mission
Impossible or Fury or any of these shows that

00:47:37.050 --> 00:47:39.049
he'd ever done.

00:47:39.049 --> 00:47:41.069
And they were all kinda different.

00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:42.890
Peter Graves is a lovely guy.

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:44.299
Wonderful, wonderful guy.

00:47:44.299 --> 00:47:48.380
And he just, he didn't really completely get
it.

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:49.380
But he loved it later.

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:50.700
When he saw it.

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:51.700
[laughter]

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:57.480
And his wife was just hysterical in the first
screening for after the movie was finished

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:58.480
for everybody.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:06.329
And, but he just, he kind of was just totally
cooperative.

00:48:06.329 --> 00:48:07.329
You know.

00:48:07.329 --> 00:48:08.660
So we would tell him a lot.

00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.470
"OK say the line.

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:13.140
Then say this line.

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:14.140
Look up.

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:16.130
Say that line, then look down, then look back."

00:48:16.130 --> 00:48:18.390
Like particularly with the little boy.

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:21.809
That's kinda tricky stuff.

00:48:21.809 --> 00:48:24.010
[laughter]

00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:30.400
So, we really explained to him when he could
look at him, 'cause if he looks at him and

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.880
says "Have you ever seen a grown man naked?"
it's not gonna work.

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:38.261
[laughter] You know so he has to say "Joey,
have you ever seen a grown man na--?"

00:48:38.261 --> 00:48:44.481
So, you know we, but he was totally cooperative
and played it just like, you know, and it

00:48:44.481 --> 00:48:46.660
was great.

00:48:46.660 --> 00:48:50.040
Lloyd Bridges was a little different.

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:55.980
He was the one and Lloyd, I think, is fantastic
in the film.

00:48:55.980 --> 00:49:00.630
But you can kinda see that he was the one
that wanted to be funny a little bit.

00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:01.630
You know?

00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:09.550
He was the one who is, who I think, I felt
was the, had the most trouble controlling.

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:12.030
But in the end, it kind of worked.

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:15.420
And it was fine and it gave us different levels.

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:22.319
And so I like, in a lot of situations, it
just, it we had some argument but it worked

00:49:22.319 --> 00:49:23.319
out great.

00:49:23.319 --> 00:49:25.049
And he was also a great guy.

00:49:25.049 --> 00:49:27.089
He was a great guy, Lloyd.

00:49:27.089 --> 00:49:29.720
So that was already great.

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.720
That was good.

00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:37.380
Robert Stack was a good, Robert Stack is not
really a comedian, but he got it.

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:44.020
He got it and he looked and there was one
moment actually in rehearsals where Lloyd

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:50.010
Bridges was asking "Why would my character
say this line?"

00:49:50.010 --> 00:49:52.520
You know, it's like, trying to think about
it really.

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:53.520
Think it through.

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:54.520
[laughter]

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:55.520
Like an actor's role.

00:49:55.520 --> 00:50:00.390
You know, this is not, Stanislavsky will not
help you here.

00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:02.180
[laughter]

00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:07.110
So he, so but Stack just, you know and we're
kind a still young.

00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:08.110
Rehearsal is--.

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:09.110
Young kids.

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:12.010
So for us, you have to understand these guys
were major stars and heroes for us.

00:50:12.010 --> 00:50:14.490
Because we grew up with all of them.

00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:20.349
But Stack just said, he said "Lloyd, who cares,
there's a spear going in the wall behind you

00:50:20.349 --> 00:50:22.640
and a watermelon falling in front of me.

00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:23.930
Just keep talking Lloyd.

00:50:23.930 --> 00:50:26.650
Nobody's lookin' at us."

00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:28.380
You know?

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:29.380
[laughter]

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:34.650
Which was great 'cause he really, Stack was
just, he kind of, he knew.

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:37.089
He said "We're the Stooges."

00:50:37.089 --> 00:50:38.640
But he was willing to do that.

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:41.521
And thought it was appropriate and all.

00:50:41.521 --> 00:50:43.270
And it, lovely, lovely guy.

00:50:43.270 --> 00:50:44.790
Robert Stack.

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:47.340
And then, Leslie Neilsen.

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:52.430
Who then, I remember the casting agent was
couldn't understand why we wanted Leslie Neilsen.

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:58.760
He kept saying "Leslie Neilsen is the guy
you go to the night before, when you can't

00:50:58.760 --> 00:50:59.760
get anyone else."

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:02.119
And we said "No, no, he's got that thing.

00:51:02.119 --> 00:51:05.220
Really, he'll be perfect for the doctor."

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:11.180
And Leslie Neilsen was the one that was a
fish in water.

00:51:11.180 --> 00:51:13.890
Leslie said later "I would have paid you guys
to do this."

00:51:13.890 --> 00:51:14.890
Would he?

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:15.890
[laughter]

00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:16.950
Yeah, no, but I think he meant it.

00:51:16.950 --> 00:51:22.270
And Leslie, it's interesting, people always
ask "were you surprised that he was so good

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:23.619
at comedy?"

00:51:23.619 --> 00:51:30.930
And my reaction is really, "No, I was more
surprised that he did drama all those years."

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:32.640
Because he really is an nutty guy.

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:37.030
It's not like he's a serious guy but he turns
on a thing and he can do comedy.

00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:41.670
It was, he's a nutty guy who can get into
that serious mode and be the captain of the

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:43.109
titanic.

00:51:43.109 --> 00:51:47.980
Or the, what's that movie, the, anyway.

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:49.089
[laughter]

00:51:49.089 --> 00:51:51.420
The movie where he says "Oh my God."

00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:53.420
When the tidal wave comes.

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:54.420
Anyway.

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:59.099
So, the, before we're done someone has to
think of the name of that.

00:51:59.099 --> 00:52:00.390
"Poseidon Adventure."

00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:01.690
Thank you.

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:04.510
So, but he was, Leslie was a joy.

00:52:04.510 --> 00:52:06.690
And he was an anarchist like we were.

00:52:06.690 --> 00:52:08.311
&gt;&gt;male audience member: What about Kareem
Abdul Jabar?

00:52:08.311 --> 00:52:09.311
Do you remember?

00:52:09.311 --> 00:52:10.311
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Well, Kareem was great too.

00:52:10.311 --> 00:52:13.470
We actually wrote the role for Pete Rose but
it was during baseball season so we couldn't

00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:15.289
get Pete Rose.

00:52:15.289 --> 00:52:22.300
[laughter] So we decided to cast, we decided
Kareem would be good, we'd go after Kareem.

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:27.059
So we went Kareem and I think we offered him
$25,000.

00:52:27.059 --> 00:52:31.880
And his agent called back and says "It's gotta
be, he wants 30.

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:35.000
Because he wants to buy an oriental rug and
it costs 30."

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:41.700
And that's the only reason he'll do it.

00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:43.230
[laughter]

00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:48.039
And I thought to myself, this is the greatest
line I've ever heard from an agent.

00:52:48.039 --> 00:52:49.180
[laughter]

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:51.640
I want this guy to represent me.

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:52.750
[laughter]

00:52:52.750 --> 00:52:55.610
And so, but we really, really wanted him.

00:52:55.610 --> 00:53:02.530
And of course even $5,000 on a three million
dollar movie was really, is a lot.

00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:04.880
So we said "Yes."

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.660
So excited to have Kareem.

00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:14.520
And like two weeks later, there's an article
in a little blurb in TIME Magazine featuring,

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:20.290
that shows Kareem in front of a big oriental
rug that he'd just bought.

00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:21.290
[laugher]

00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:22.710
For $30,000.

00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:24.829
At some auction.

00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:25.829
So who knew?

00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:26.829
But Kareem was great.

00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:36.099
Kareem was, it's funny, I was, Kareem was
not, you know, the, a skilled actor.

00:53:36.099 --> 00:53:38.160
But he was also lovely.

00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:39.240
Really a good guy.

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:43.089
Kind, of, you know, took a bit to get to know,
you know.

00:53:43.089 --> 00:53:46.420
He's not like gregarious a bit.

00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:49.369
He's a little more shy around people.

00:53:49.369 --> 00:53:52.630
And of course, your neck, I mean, he's so
tall.

00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:58.800
But he's really, but I grew very fond of Kareem
and I actually just saw him a year ago.

00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:01.539
And it was funny.

00:54:01.539 --> 00:54:09.730
He's, he says he that he always every time
he goes on an airplane, people, like the pilots

00:54:09.730 --> 00:54:12.000
invite him up to the cockpit or whatever.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000
[laughter]

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:20.130
Stuff like that, and I thought, that's movie
must be really powerful if they're inviting

00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:23.210
a guy named Kareem up to the cockpit.

00:54:23.210 --> 00:54:24.820
[laughter]

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:25.820
In this day and age.

00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.339
But no, no, no.

00:54:27.339 --> 00:54:28.940
He was great.

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:34.910
And you know, really lucky to have had him
in the movie.

00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:37.530
It's hard to imagine it without him.

00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:38.530
Yeah.

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:42.140
&gt;&gt;audience member: Can you tell us about Auto?

00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:43.160
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Auto?

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.190
Yeah, auto.

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:46.750
Actually there were two Autos.

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:48.910
One of which is I think rotting in my basement.

00:54:48.910 --> 00:54:50.589
But anyway, the.

00:54:50.589 --> 00:54:53.790
I don't know how much you think it'd be worth
on eBay.

00:54:53.790 --> 00:54:55.590
&gt;&gt;audience member: [inaudible]

00:54:55.590 --> 00:54:57.910
&gt;&gt;Jerry: Actually mine is the female one.

00:54:57.910 --> 00:55:01.320
Because what they did is, we didn't, once
again low budget.

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:06.339
There really was only one that did the main
one that was used.

00:55:06.339 --> 00:55:13.130
The second one was only for, it was like a
more of a balloon.

00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:15.809
Like a little bit more like this kind of thing.

00:55:15.809 --> 00:55:22.680
Where when she, when it takes it out, when
it's released from its seat, and it's sort

00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:25.809
of grabbing her and stuff like that.

00:55:25.809 --> 00:55:35.809
That, but, the one that I have was the Auto,
but at the, it's repainted to the female face

00:55:35.809 --> 00:55:38.550
for the end of the film.

00:55:38.550 --> 00:55:44.160
But that was a clever deal that they, I mean,
they made the head swivel, and they figured

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:47.420
out how to make it bounce up and down and
all that stuff.

00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:50.830
So that was, Auto was fun.

00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:52.470
So I guess on that note.

00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:53.550
&gt;&gt;presenter: Yeah.

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:54.829
&gt;&gt;Jerry: But thank you.

00:55:54.829 --> 00:55:57.440
You guys have been, I actually ended up loving
you.

00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:58.440
Thank you.

00:55:58.440 --> 00:55:59.440
Thank you very much.

00:55:59.440 --> 00:55:59.441
[applause]
