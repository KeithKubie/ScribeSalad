00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.160
Here I'm showing a simple 256 by 256 sample image.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:09.424
And what we will do now is look at how we can apply various types of Gaussian,

00:00:09.424 --> 00:00:10.649
kernels to it.

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:12.414
Let's start off with the most simplest one.

00:00:12.414 --> 00:00:18.568
Now here I'm using sigma of 1 pointed, kernel, round, and

00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:25.251
as you go away from the center, 0 0, it gets closer to, to being 0 values.

00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:30.240
The resulting image here is blurred, but not extremely blurred.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.380
It's got a little bit of defocusing going on.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.470
But as I increase the variance to sigma 3, you can start noticing more blurring.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.110
Similarly as I move to sigma 6, even more blurring is visible.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.772
And, finally moving all the way up here, we can basically sigma 9, and

00:00:46.772 --> 00:00:50.603
it's the most blurred image there is of the sequence here.

00:00:50.603 --> 00:00:54.909
And that's an important part for us to remember, that basically now by changing

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.407
sigma, which is basically the variance, we've basically increased the extent of

00:00:59.407 --> 00:01:02.450
the smoothing from one point across the whole image.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.607
And again the kernel here was different sizes.

00:01:04.607 --> 00:01:08.760
And we can play around with, of course, the neighborhood size of the kernel too.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.740
So this basically now shows us we can use Gaussian Filters for smoothing.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.010
It's something we will actually play around with a lot in the rest of

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.270
the lecture as we start getting into things like kernel filters and

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.870
stuff like that
