00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.969
So now that we have seen how function inlining works,

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:08.420
let's do function inlining quiz. So let's say we have a load into A 0,

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.220
which would be the first argument of a function. And then we call a function,

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:15.350
and then we store the result of the function somewhere else. Let's say

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.130
that what the function is doing is it's computing the square of this value, and

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.150
then adding the second parameter to it, and that's what it returns. So it's

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.810
simply returning the, you know, square of the first parameter plus the second

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.810
parameter. Let's say we have a processor where load takes 2 cycles to do,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.050
CALL takes 2 cycles to do, RET takes 2 cycles to do, and Store Word and

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.210
ADD are one cycle per instruction. And the multiply instruction takes 3 cycles

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.200
before we can use the result. The question for you is, after scheduling this and

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.310
this together will take how many cycles? So how many cycles from the point we

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.490
start to load, until we are done with the store. And after inlining and

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.740
then scheduling, how many cycles does this take?
