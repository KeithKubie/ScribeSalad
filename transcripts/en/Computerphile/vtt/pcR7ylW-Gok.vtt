00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.200
This is my main cabinet,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.100
which I, uh, I built some years ago

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.940
and it now lives permanently here

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:07.920
at the hack space.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.040
We don't accept money, everything is free

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.560
*laughs*

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.200
Um, so in order to insert coins, I just provide a button

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.400
You can have as many credits as you like.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.060
When people see it for the first time

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.180
They, they're always looking for the game that they played when they were kids.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.300
It's a custom carpentry cabinet that was built around a 17 inch monitor at the time

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:39.020
The reason why it has the, uh, all of the shape that it has was so that I could play the game Defender

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.900
in as realistic a manner as possible.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.340
*game noises*

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:55.340
Inside we have an old Pentium 4. It just happens to be the most recent free PC I got hold of

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.480
MAME is an acronym for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.600
just emulates different, um, arcade machine hardware.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.300
They were just computers

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.560
There were quite a lot of popular processors

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.520
Uh, Z80s, 6800s, 68000s

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.720
It's basically just a PC and the only fancy stuff is the controls

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.300
[offscreen] Can we have a look?

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.660
Well, the joysticks and buttons are just microswitches.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.880
All of the  microswitches come out and come into a keyboard matrix.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.400
Whilst this one is based on a keyboard matrix breakout that I managed to get as part of my job,

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.040
previous incarnations I've had, I've just ripped out the keyboard matrix from a keyboard

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.540
but when you press a button on a keyboard, there's a two-dimensional matrix of contacts

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:58.000
You join up, uh, a row and a column, uh, that sends a signal to a small, very small PIC

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.120
Programmable Interrupt Controller, PIC

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:08.300
Which interprets that and sends out a keyboard scan code to the PC.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.040
You get a means of inputting 150 different buttons or something like that.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:23.100
In practice you can't really use all of those button presses because keyboard controllers tend to think that if you press more than four buttons at once

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.620
that the cat's sat on the keyboard or something like that, and it disables those keys.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:36.400
The various keypresses that result from joystick movements come into what is broken out as a keyboard matrix here

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.520
and just goes down into the PC

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.180
I've also got an external keyboard

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.920
for convenient typing of commands and what-have-you.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.100
These joysticks are either 8-way or 4-way

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.820
If you were playing a maze-type game, say pacman,

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.100
you definitely don't want diagonals because they register, say, up and left at the same time

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.980
and it's entirely up to the game whether you're gonna go left or up when you get to a junction.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.100
These joysticks have a built-in template that's selectable from above

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.520
which is one of the reasons why I spent the massive 50 pounds on these joysticks

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.100
which limits the angles at which the joystick can go, it basically cuts out the corners

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.600
so that you can only go up, down, left, or right

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.440
and that's selected by lifting the joystick, and giving it a twist

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.340
Currently runs a version of Ubuntu, a very lightweight Ubuntu called Xubuntu, spelled with an X

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.180
Linux is free, you're free to make it do just what you want, so that you retain control of your computing experience.

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.720
It's not the most recent Ubuntu release. Each upgrade require a bit more, uh, computing power.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.140
So I'm going for the low-end Ubuntu, lightweight distribution.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:55.220
And every time I change it, there are things to fix, so I'm sticking with what I've got right now.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.800
Okay, right so

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.820
[offscreen] so this comes out in a drawer, very handy

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.840
Yes, please excuse the mess. It's basically running the XFCE desktop

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.420
The Cholesterol Free Computing Environment

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:17.940
I'm using a frontend called wahcade, which is basically a python frontend that will give us a nice keyboard-based user interface

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.780
through which we can select which game we want to play, launch the game

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.400
and it starts the MAME application for us,

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.080
hiding all the computing business.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.800
We're free to select from the different games that I happen to have

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.240
The cabinet design is based on the genuine Defender arcade machine

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.540
developed by Williams in 1980.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.680
*game noise*

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.840
In fact, the code for this was written over a weekend

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.980
in time for a trade fair. And it turned out to be one of the most popular games of the early 1980s

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.620
Defender is a strange game in that it has an up and down joystick and seven additional buttons

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.720
It does mean that I use both player 1 and player 2 controls

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.460
And so, although I'm not playing very well at the moment, because I'm trying to multitask - *laughs*

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:11.340
My intention is to - *screams* - become as good as the heroes I had when I was a teenager

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.260
Who would play Defender all day in the arcade

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:16.500
for just 10p

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.920
I only really work with stuff that I get for nothing

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.200
Stuff that would otherwise be thrown away

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:33.800
This is an old monitor from a railway destination indicator. I get to pick up things like this due to my job

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.060
when we do refurbishments of railway stations.

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:43.640
It will have displayed departures, how late your train is, that sort of thing.

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.500
There's a certain amount of screen burn which is hard to see right now

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.960
but, there's a, yeah
