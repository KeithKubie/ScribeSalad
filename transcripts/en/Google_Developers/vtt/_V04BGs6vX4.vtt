00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.378
SRIKANTH: Good afternoon folks.

00:00:13.378 --> 00:00:14.180
Welcome to IO.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.758
Hope you've had an
eventful day already.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.440
It's an action packed agenda
the next couple of days.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.178
My name is Srikanth
Rajagopalan.

00:00:23.558 --> 00:00:28.558
I'm the product manager for
Google Power Meter and over the

00:00:28.558 --> 00:00:33.700
next hour, I and, Rus Heywood,
the lead engineer, will give

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.180
you a sense for what Google is
trying to do in the energy

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.020
information space with
Google Power Meter.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.120
Where we are and what's ahead
of us in terms of where we

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.120
want to take the product.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.960
We're gonna focus largely
on the API side of things.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.240
Hopefully, you'll get a good
sense for where the product

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.540
is and with what's ahead.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.300
I've been on PowerMeter
for the last year, in

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.180
Google about 5 years.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.040
Been largely helping build the
partnerships and developer

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.300
community around
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.998
with Google Power Meter and
will be glad to talk to you all

00:01:11.998 --> 00:01:14.280
post this discussion also.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.100
Just a reminder, we have a live
wave that goes with the session

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.460
so there will be notes but
also, more importantly, there's

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.640
a Q&amp;A and questions that
we're collecting on there.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.518
If you have any points that
you want to bring up,

00:01:29.518 --> 00:01:30.540
just bring it up there.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.438
And also at the end of the talk
we'll also have mics here that

00:01:33.438 --> 00:01:36.280
we can use for any questions.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.320
So over the next 30, 35
minutes, we're gonna

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.858
essentially give you a sense
of where the product is,

00:01:42.858 --> 00:01:43.620
what it actually does.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.998
We're then gonna have Rus walk,
do a little bit more of a

00:01:47.998 --> 00:01:52.800
deeper drill down into the
design elements of how we build

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.520
the product and how it
influences the API.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.760
And then, how do we actually
go about using the API.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.800
Then we'll end
with the Q&amp;A.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.320
So let me start by giving
a quick overview of

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.500
what Power Meter is.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.080
As I said, it's a relatively
new offering from Google.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.620
We've been at it for about 18
months and we've been public

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.800
about it for the last 12
months or so at this point.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.698
The essential premise that we
started the project on, and it

00:02:23.698 --> 00:02:24.138
started off as [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:24.138 --> 00:02:28.318
project internally, was that we
should have the same level of

00:02:28.318 --> 00:02:33.208
access to energy information
for users as they have to

00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:35.058
anything else online.

00:02:35.318 --> 00:02:39.398
And we found as we got into the
space there is some things that

00:02:39.398 --> 00:02:41.538
are happening which are moving
in the general direction.

00:02:41.538 --> 00:02:43.858
But there is, in general, not
been the level of access

00:02:43.858 --> 00:02:46.918
and transparency and more
importantly, how users can get

00:02:46.918 --> 00:02:52.440
to this information and use it
and how they manage their

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.718
household and their usage
and energy consumption.

00:02:57.718 --> 00:03:01.878
The essential premise is that
when you show something to

00:03:01.878 --> 00:03:05.518
somebody, that it makes them
think about it and we directly

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:08.558
want to influence their
behavior with it.

00:03:09.918 --> 00:03:12.378
So our goal is to really track
and allow people to track

00:03:12.378 --> 00:03:14.378
how much they're using.

00:03:14.378 --> 00:03:20.138
Use that to gain some insights
and take action around how you

00:03:20.138 --> 00:03:22.838
can get better at energy.

00:03:22.518 --> 00:03:25.638
This is initially focused on
electricity but the platform

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:28.778
and the capabilities allow us
to also experience other

00:03:28.778 --> 00:03:32.670
aspects of energy
as we go forward.

00:03:33.638 --> 00:03:35.898
It's a completely
online based system.

00:03:35.818 --> 00:03:40.458
It's something that we want to
be able to provide to the users

00:03:40.458 --> 00:03:41.578
anytime, anywhere they want.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.738
And most importantly, it's a
project of Google dot org.

00:03:45.738 --> 00:03:51.980
And like other philantrophic
initiatives, Google dot org is

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.338
unique in not just looking at
projects from a funding and

00:03:56.338 --> 00:03:59.178
grant making perspective but
really trying to figure out

00:03:59.178 --> 00:04:04.618
ways we can use Google's assets
whether it be infrastructure or

00:04:04.618 --> 00:04:08.218
engineering or RIP that we have
internally, and build

00:04:08.218 --> 00:04:11.618
interesting products that add
value to the society.

00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:16.638
Being part of Google dot org,
it's also the case that we're

00:04:16.638 --> 00:04:21.578
not really measuring the sucess
of Power Meter in dollar terms

00:04:21.578 --> 00:04:24.278
or monitorization metrics.

00:04:24.618 --> 00:04:27.298
But it's really being measured
more in terms of the

00:04:27.298 --> 00:04:28.800
impact it's having.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.660
For us, the success of the
project is measured on how many

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.100
users are we able to get on.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.060
How much are they
saving in energy?

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.398
Through energy savings,
how much are they able

00:04:37.398 --> 00:04:38.838
to save in dollar terms.

00:04:38.838 --> 00:04:41.278
So the success of the project
is more in terms of the impact

00:04:41.278 --> 00:04:45.578
of what the product makes
people do as opposed

00:04:45.578 --> 00:04:47.920
to any other metrics.

00:04:48.578 --> 00:04:52.618
We want to, very obviously, use
that as a way to kind of drive

00:04:52.618 --> 00:04:57.598
some innovation in the space.

00:04:57.598 --> 00:04:59.858
As I mentioned, one of the
fundamental premises:

00:04:59.858 --> 00:05:01.378
awareness drives action.

00:05:02.338 --> 00:05:04.678
Some of you may be aware
of this and it's also

00:05:04.678 --> 00:05:08.240
been commonly cited,
especially recently.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.238
There's this notion of a Prius
effect which is, if you show

00:05:14.238 --> 00:05:19.618
information and the data to
a user, it makes them think

00:05:19.618 --> 00:05:21.318
about how they're using it.

00:05:21.678 --> 00:05:26.618
Using the system or using the
resource and actively learn

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:29.720
and manage it better.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.990
This is just an example of a
recent user who got on Power

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.118
Meter about 9 months back and
since then, has dramatically

00:05:40.118 --> 00:05:42.778
reduced their consumption
in their house by

00:05:42.778 --> 00:05:43.800
almost about 50%.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:47.620
On a more personal note, I had
almost no idea about what

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.458
I was using in my house.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:53.458
I was, I would say a very
average consumer of

00:05:53.458 --> 00:05:56.398
a single family home
of a couple of kids.

00:05:56.838 --> 00:06:01.720
And we really don't have a
good sense for we do at home.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.758
And since I've used Power Meter
and understood how I'm

00:06:06.758 --> 00:06:09.720
consuming energy in the house,
I've actively learned to

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.800
manage what I'm doing.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.680
I've updated my appliances as
part of a recent remodeling and

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.760
I'm, at this point, saving
about $500 dollars a year

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.500
purely just on the basis of
reduced electricity bills.

00:06:21.938 --> 00:06:26.418
We do see and we do feel
that there is very easy

00:06:26.418 --> 00:06:27.720
gains to be made here.

00:06:27.378 --> 00:06:31.698
It's really important for us to
get the data at a very high

00:06:31.698 --> 00:06:34.758
granularity with a lot of
resolution and with low

00:06:34.758 --> 00:06:35.118
latency to the user.

00:06:35.118 --> 00:06:38.338
And that's what makes
the information

00:06:38.338 --> 00:06:39.458
sticky and impactful.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.638
Giving a sense for how Power
Meter works today; it's a

00:06:46.638 --> 00:06:49.138
resedential solution
at this point.

00:06:49.138 --> 00:06:51.860
It's largely focused on
resedential users because we

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:55.920
also felt there are lots of
solutions for commercial and

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.558
industrial applications but
there is not really a

00:06:58.558 --> 00:06:59.618
good solution for the
resedential space.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.480
And in the resedential context
there is a need to really

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:12.278
drive more of through
this information.

00:07:14.918 --> 00:07:17.978
Google's focus in providing
Power Meter has been largely to

00:07:17.978 --> 00:07:22.758
build a softer platform and the
framework to allow data to be

00:07:22.758 --> 00:07:27.100
sent in and be able to
visualize with the user.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.740
But we can't do this
without good sensors.

00:07:31.198 --> 00:07:34.486
We are not directly buidling
the sensors but we are really

00:07:34.486 --> 00:07:38.718
workling very closely with 2
main consituents who are

00:07:38.718 --> 00:07:40.600
responsible and who are
required, in a way, to

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.200
get to this information.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:47.280
The first route is what we
are referring to here as the

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.120
energy management devices.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:51.540
There is a slew of partners
that we're working with now,

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.980
some are public and some that
you'll start hearing about in

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.018
the coming days and weeks.

00:07:57.858 --> 00:08:02.618
They're really providing easy
to install sensors typically

00:08:02.618 --> 00:08:05.698
to measure the electricity
consumption for

00:08:05.698 --> 00:08:06.998
the entire house.

00:08:06.918 --> 00:08:11.318
But also starting to look at
ways to give you more localized

00:08:11.318 --> 00:08:15.680
sensors for pluggable data and
appliance leveled information.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.360
So these devices can be
installed easily by the user,

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:25.578
usually on their own, and
sometimes with some assistance.

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:28.898
Once the device is in the house
and its measuring, it can

00:08:28.898 --> 00:08:32.898
transfer the data to Google
Power Meter through a simple

00:08:32.898 --> 00:08:33.420
G databased rest API.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.400
That assumes that the
house has some basic

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:38.940
broadband connectivity.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.540
The solution itself and
the integration itself

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:42.220
is lightweight enough.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.720
We're not talking of
sending gobloads of data.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:48.000
It's not high bandwidth
requirements but it at least

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.298
assumes that there is
persistent connectivity so that

00:08:50.298 --> 00:08:54.558
we are able to get the data out
to the data store that

00:08:54.558 --> 00:08:56.380
Power Meter provides.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.840
The second route and thus
probably as important, and

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.780
probably a way for us to
acclerate how we drive

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.680
an option is through
the utility route.

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.820
Some of you may be familiar
with the smartBridge rollout

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.300
which is happening now in many,
many parts of the country

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:12.020
as well as internationally.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.700
It's all around deploying or
having utilizites rolling out

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.600
what are known as smart meters
which are better and more

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.760
sophisticated meters with
usually some form of wireless

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.520
and or radio connectvity.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:33.040
A major premise of smart meters
has been to drive the roll out

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.960
largely from the transmission
and distribution requirments

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.880
perspective which is to allow
the utilities to manage the

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.360
transmission and monitoring
of power consumption better.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.500
It has really not focused
so much on how do you make

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.340
that informatoin also be
availalbe to the user.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:53.660
We feel that we can help access
or provide that access.

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.960
We have been working very
closely with a range of

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.800
partners globablly to allow
them to take that information

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.180
that is coming to them anywhere
for billing and also transfer

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.820
it to Google Power Meter.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.900
They do this again, through the
same G databased rest API.

00:10:11.398 --> 00:10:13.678
We essentially have a similar
setup where you typically have

00:10:13.678 --> 00:10:16.798
a broadband or using the back
haul network from the utility,

00:10:16.798 --> 00:10:20.920
they can provide the
information at the user's

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.020
behest and then make it
available to the user.

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:28.388
Once it's in the data store,
the primary access to

00:10:28.388 --> 00:10:29.278
the information is
through a browser.

00:10:30.398 --> 00:10:32.678
I'll give a quick view
of how we make that

00:10:32.678 --> 00:10:33.978
information availalbe.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.578
But today it's an iGoogle
solution and also a standalone

00:10:38.578 --> 00:10:40.828
site which you can access
through a browser, whether it

00:10:40.828 --> 00:10:45.140
be at your house or on your
phone and or devices and make

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:51.120
that available to the user
at no cost or at no charge.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:56.120
The third major participant in
this picture are application

00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:00.060
developers and proably a lot
of people that are

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.560
in this audience.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.240
We feel that we really need
to drive a lot more creative

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.620
ways to make people
understand the data.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.180
There's obviously lots of
information coming in but it

00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:13.420
can also be used in creative
and innovative ways.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.720
We feel we have some approaches
that we want to try out

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.300
ourselves but more importantly,
we want to make it possible and

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.840
feasible for third party
application developers to be

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.920
able to use information and do
interesting things with it.

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.260
Again, we are hoping to be able
to expose some of the API's and

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.660
overtime, expand
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.120
of these API's.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:37.040
The goal is really how do we
make users understand the

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.180
information and do
something with it.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.560
Let me give you a quick
sense for the product.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:48.500
This is more a static slide
but this is my information

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.280
coming from my house.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:51.120
I woke up pretty early today.

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:57.120
This is running today
as an iGoogle gadget.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.940
You can click through it and
it goes through a more full

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:04.480
fleshed site where you can get
more starter information.

00:12:07.198 --> 00:12:11.038
At a summary level, essentially
you can navigate over time, you

00:12:11.038 --> 00:12:14.740
can view the information
at multiple granularity.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.360
I have a home energy management
device that I installed in my

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:22.520
house so it's transferring data
in this case with about 15

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.520
minute latency and once
every 15 minutes.

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:30.470
Its very high resolution and
low latency so it allows me

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:35.300
to see what I'm doing with
almost no delay and lags.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.580
I can obviously navigate the
data back and forth in time.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.740
I can also customize it.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.900
We feel that it's not just
showing energy information but

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.020
you also need to make it
visible to the user in terms

00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.338
that they can understand
and relate to.

00:12:50.338 --> 00:12:54.440
You can set an approximate
cost per unit of consumption.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.620
We show the information in
terms of approximately how much

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:04.020
we anticipate you using based
on the measurements

00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:06.600
that they're getting
from the device.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.420
We also allow for some basic
features around letting the

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:13.420
user set targets for themselves
and be able to say something

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:16.304
like: I want to set a budget
for myself in terms of how much

00:13:16.304 --> 00:13:19.460
I wanna use and use that
to drive the behavior.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.460
And recently, about a couple of
months back, we launched a

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:24.040
social feature where we can now
share this information with

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.520
your friends and family.

00:13:27.918 --> 00:13:30.798
I'm the primary owner of
the data in this case.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.800
I see it on my iGoogle page but
I can obviously share it with

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.500
and easily share it with
anybody on my contacts list and

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.120
they get to see the same
information but in a more

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:48.760
readerly basis on their iGoogle
pages and the standalone site.

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.300
That's primarily what I had in
terms of a quick introduction.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:55.880
I'm gonna hand it over to Rus
now to give us the next level

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.160
of detail, the product, and
what we're trying

00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.460
to do with API.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.880
RUS: Can everybody
hear me okay?

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.380
I sound microphoned, very good.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:09.320
What I wanted to talk to you
about is sort of, how we

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.418
decided to build the system.

00:14:10.418 --> 00:14:14.958
So we have an API but
underneath the API is the

00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.740
core storage system, the
presentation layer,

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:17.780
security system.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.260
I just wanted to walk you
through what we were

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.420
thinking about when
we built the product.

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:26.100
I've been working on the
product since the beginning.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:28.000
I checked in the
first line of code.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.740
That was probably 18
months ago I guess.

00:14:31.158 --> 00:14:35.158
We've been adding partners,
adding data, adding devices,

00:14:35.158 --> 00:14:38.340
adding users ever since.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:41.220
So the first couple of major
bullet points that were

00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:45.440
important to us was that
the system needed to have

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.058
flexible data acquisition.

00:14:46.058 --> 00:14:50.740
So we wanted it to be really
easy for a wide variety of data

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:54.158
providers like a device your
house, or smart appliance or

00:14:54.158 --> 00:14:56.780
a smart meter at a utility.

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.600
They'll all have data in
wildly different formats.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.940
They'll all have different kind
of latency characteristics.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:07.940
Utilities sometimes send us
a chirp as soon as they

00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:08.218
have a piece of data.

00:15:08.218 --> 00:15:11.078
Other times they want to
backhaul it and archive it

00:15:11.078 --> 00:15:13.378
and refine it and then
send it in nightly.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.960
Sometimes they want to send in
back dated historical data.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.558
Devices might also kind of,
have network drop outs and

00:15:20.558 --> 00:15:22.340
then need to recover
and retry later.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:27.080
So it was important to us to
allow the system to handle data

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:29.600
in kind of random access.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:34.240
You can write historical
data, you can forward data,

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.612
you can back date data.

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.100
And of course we wanted the
service to always be available

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:42.800
which is why we built it on the
same Google infrastructure that

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.318
keeps Gmail working
and search working.

00:15:45.058 --> 00:15:47.118
Those are the same
systems that we use.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.960
Another key principal, I guess,
that we built in from the

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.240
very beginning was privacy.

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.140
So we recognize that the smart
grid -- you've probably seen a

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:04.420
lot of press if you follow this
industry -- the smart grid is,

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:08.620
this is a new world of, how
important is this data?

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:09.260
How sensitive is this data?

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:11.258
Whose is the data?

00:16:11.258 --> 00:16:14.300
It was important for us to make
sure that the data kind of

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.660
really belonged to the user and
they had as much control over

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:20.860
it, that they had ultimate
control over it.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:24.140
So one of the things that Power
Meter does is it makes sure

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:27.738
that it always has your
explicit consent before it

00:16:27.738 --> 00:16:30.460
accepts data about you, even if
you're not sending us the data.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:34.058
For example, if you have a
utility, they know how much

00:16:34.058 --> 00:16:35.138
power you've been using.

00:16:35.138 --> 00:16:37.940
They could send it to us
but we won't let them.

00:16:38.198 --> 00:16:43.266
We won't store the data until
you agree that we should store

00:16:43.266 --> 00:16:44.140
the data on your behalf.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:47.580
So that was an important part
of our designing the system.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.780
You'll see that in the kind
of activation process that

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:51.020
I'll talk about later.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.120
And of course then it
goes the other way.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:57.638
You can sort of easily punch a
button and say please purge all

00:16:57.638 --> 00:17:00.380
this data; I don't want Google
to keep track of it anymore.

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.180
So we want to make sure
everyone feels comfortable with

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:05.132
this state and how we store it.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.760
Everything is authenticated.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.800
Everything is audited.

00:17:08.178 --> 00:17:14.500
There's no kind of anonymous or
published or publicly published

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.880
individual data feeds so even
though you can't tell whose

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.738
data it is, we don't let anyone
have your data whether they

00:17:23.738 --> 00:17:24.380
know that its yours or not.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:26.260
It just kind of an important
part of keeping that

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.018
data private and secure.

00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:35.140
Yay!

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.280
That worked.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:40.960
Security, of course, goes
hand and hand with privacy.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:43.480
Our API is secured with Auth
sub, which if you're familiar

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:47.480
with other Google API's, its a
kind of token scheme that

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:52.060
allows you to tie access to
an API to a Google account.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:56.760
Its sort of just as if you're
looking into a web page except

00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.180
for that you delegate that
authorization to a computer so

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:02.200
that it can use the
API on your behalf.

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.118
We secure everything with
Google accounts so the same

00:18:05.118 --> 00:18:07.338
account information that you
might have set up for Gmail

00:18:07.338 --> 00:18:12.160
or for search preferences or
for iGoogle, Power Meter has

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.580
that same account system.

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:19.260
There's no separate
system to use.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.900
And when we integrate with a
data provider like a device or

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.598
like a utility that's got your
data and is sending it on

00:18:25.598 --> 00:18:28.560
your behalf, they can't
find out who you are.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.700
They can't find out your email
address that Google knows.

00:18:31.558 --> 00:18:32.618
They can't get your
search history.

00:18:32.618 --> 00:18:36.420
They can't get
anything about you.

00:18:36.078 --> 00:18:41.578
We obfuscate your ID with this
kind of crytographic key that

00:18:41.578 --> 00:18:46.420
we give them and they tie it to
your account on their side but

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.688
they can't then use it to get
any other information that

00:18:48.688 --> 00:18:49.920
Google has about you.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.120
That's a kind of key part
of keeping your personal

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.760
identifiable information
yours and private.

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:03.940
I'm gonna talk in a little
more detail about personal

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.540
identifying information
in a second.

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:10.440
This works, yes, ok.

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.640
The storage model -- it's more
than just storage it's really

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.480
the kind of concepts that you
can access with API and the

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.640
concepts that Power Meter
manages in stores for you -- at

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.300
the simplest level,
you have users.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:29.298
Everything is about the user
and the user's data that gets

00:19:29.298 --> 00:19:33.820
uploaded from a variety of
sources on your behalf.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.920
I'm gonna use my fancy
new laser pointer here.

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:37.420
You like the color?

00:19:38.858 --> 00:19:40.200
I ordered a smoke machine
for this presentation but

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.440
it didn't come through.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.940
Anyway so all of the data
is stored associated

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:46.920
with a particular user.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:50.880
Power Meter cannot and will not
receive any data unless it's

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.300
marked for a particular person.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.400
So that way we can tell
immediately when we receive the

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.740
data, whether or not that
person has agreed to let us

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.540
receive it and we reject it
right away if it's data that we

00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.300
don't have explicit
consent for.

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:08.920
So we have something called a
zone which you can think of as

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:14.800
a writeable silo inside of the
user's kind of, space

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:15.800
within Power Meter.

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.600
There's several different
flavors of zone, which I'll

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.280
go through in a second.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.860
The first one is the
users own zone.

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:26.600
We call it a user zone
or the personal zone.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.380
And if they have a device such
as an energy monitor that they

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.140
installed themselves that's
monitoring their whole house,

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.938
or if they have a plug sensor
that's monitoring their

00:20:35.938 --> 00:20:38.520
entertainment system, or if
they have a smart appliance

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.940
that's sending in data about
how much energy it's using.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.220
Then all of those things kind
of get authorized to operate

00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.440
on behalf of the user.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:50.340
Then they use the kind of token
I talked about before -- which

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.960
they get using the activation
process, which I"ll talk

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:55.720
about in just a second --
and they send the data into

00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:59.580
the user's kind of zone.

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:02.720
And we store data in kind
of data streams which

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.320
we call variables.

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:06.320
It's just a kind of time
ordered list of measurements.

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:11.520
You can think of a variable
as, at noon 1 kilowatt

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.586
hours were used.

00:21:12.618 --> 00:21:14.460
At 1 o'clock 1 kilowatt
hours were used.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.520
At 2 o'clock 2 kilowatt
hours were used.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:19.680
It's just a kind of very simple
stream measurement and we put

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.260
each of them in a variable and
users can have as many

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:25.060
of those as they like.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:28.040
The other sort of major way
that data can come into the

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.078
system, again always on behalf
of the user, but within the

00:21:31.078 --> 00:21:35.240
user, into a different zone,
which might be created on

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.380
behalf of the utility company,
rather than for the

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:40.180
user's own devices.

00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:43.240
What's the same about the
utilities zone is that the user

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:46.928
can still access it and the
data's still theirs and if the

00:21:46.928 --> 00:21:50.640
user ever wants to cancel their
account or of course, if they

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.858
want to download the data.

00:21:51.858 --> 00:21:55.598
They can download or delete
anything that's kind of part

00:21:55.598 --> 00:21:57.260
of their Power Meter account.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.608
But if it's uploaded to the
utility company's zone then

00:22:01.608 --> 00:22:03.718
it's not modifiable in place.

00:22:03.718 --> 00:22:06.498
The user can only choose to
kind of wipe it out wholesale

00:22:06.498 --> 00:22:07.660
but they can't kind
of twiddle it.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:11.618
So that keeps the data that was
sent to us from a third party

00:22:11.618 --> 00:22:15.078
that already has a secure meter
data management system, it

00:22:15.078 --> 00:22:17.220
keeps the integrity
of the data.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.338
Even though that belongs to the
user, it also kind of is, in

00:22:21.338 --> 00:22:25.680
some sense, valued
by the utility.

00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.880
The utility can send in
data to these variables.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.600
These variables look almost the
same to the user but they're

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.840
secured very differently.

00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.940
One important sort of feature
of zones is that the user can

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:42.680
read across all of them but the
data providers can only read or

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.800
write the zone that matches
their own kind of idenity.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:50.900
So the zone in this case is
called the domain name of

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.750
the company which would
be example, utility dot

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:53.400
com, in this example.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.480
Not actually a real utility.

00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:56.780
Don't be fooled.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.120
This company can read and write
that zone but nothing else.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.220
Then you can have more,
you can have an unlimited

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.360
number of zones.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.640
So if you have one utility
company that aggregates and

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.380
provides your data for
electricity and another one for

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:14.720
solar and another one for gas,
you can just sort of stack all

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.578
these guys up into
your account.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.920
They go into different zones.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.640
They can't interfere
with each other.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.400
They can't read each
other's zones.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.740
They can't write
each other's data.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:28.998
So all the data integrity is
preserved even though it's

00:23:28.998 --> 00:23:30.420
kind of all joined together.

00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.712
And the Power Meter's security
layer takes care of all

00:23:33.712 --> 00:23:37.260
of that, which I made.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:39.600
So now I'll go into a little
detail about the API.

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.820
We'll just kind of zing through
this and we're gonna have time

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:42.160
for questions at the end.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.900
So if you have specific
questions I can go back or

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.820
answer questions for you.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:50.160
This is the API at a glance.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:50.560
It's a rest API.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:55.880
So like a lot of Goggle API's
or Google data API's, it's

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.740
based on Adam, which is kind
of a concept of, you have

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.980
feeds which ar URIs.

00:24:00.358 --> 00:24:04.760
like a sort of a
normal HTTP request.

00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:05.358
Always secured in our case.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.440
As I said security and privacy
is very important to us.

00:24:09.578 --> 00:24:12.320
It's pretty silly to allow
data to be transferred

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.160
and clear over the wire.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.538
Everything secured, HTTPS.

00:24:18.538 --> 00:24:23.480
Underneath the top-level Power
Meter feed there are feeds for

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:28.380
a particular user, feeds for
the user's variables, and then,

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:32.160
-- which I mentioned are those
kind of data streams of -- then

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.140
within each one of those, of
course, the measurements

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:34.280
themselves.

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:40.660
You can write to measurement by
doing an HDP put or post to a

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.240
particular measurement feed.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.320
Or you can -- I don't have it
on this slide -- or you can

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.900
use the batch feed, which
essentially is a single URI.

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:55.320
And you post a large number of
XML blocks that describe 20

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.040
measurements or a thousand
measurements all at once.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:03.520
We process those as if you
had hit this URL a hundred

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:04.560
times or a thousand times.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.840
We just do it more efficiently
so you don't have to

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.052
keep tearing down that
connection over and over.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:18.798
These 2 parts of the API are
the same system but there's

00:25:18.798 --> 00:25:20.220
a slightly different
naming scheme here.

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:24.890
When you are acting on behalf
of the user, using their Auth

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:26.080
subtoken that they've given
you, that they authorized you

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.900
to use because you're a smart
appliance or you're a

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.018
thermostat or you're a home
energy monitor; then you

00:25:33.018 --> 00:25:34.498
always work with the zone.

00:25:34.498 --> 00:25:38.220
Which you see here is the
third term of this URL path.

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.780
And the zone for the user is
just the user's own kind

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.838
of obfuscated ID repeated.

00:25:44.838 --> 00:25:47.318
So you identify the personal
zone by, it's just

00:25:47.318 --> 00:25:50.200
the user's ID again.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.160
But if you're a utility, you
upload to a different zone,

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.038
which, it matches
your domain name.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:59.718
When you hit the API as a
utility you use your own token.

00:25:59.718 --> 00:26:02.778
We can tell who you are and if
you try to access a zone that's

00:26:02.778 --> 00:26:04.920
not yours, we give
you the hand.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:07.280
And you can't access these
kind of user zones either.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.420
That's kind of how we maintain
segmentation very efficiently.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.400
But otherwise the
API's the same.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.612
You still get variables
inside the zone.

00:26:15.612 --> 00:26:20.900
You still post measurements
using this kind of familiar

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.840
rest, post, put, get API.

00:26:23.058 --> 00:26:26.538
I should say that you can get
anything out of the API that

00:26:26.538 --> 00:26:28.738
you put into it as
a data provider.

00:26:28.738 --> 00:26:30.140
So all of these feeds that
you can post to, you

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:31.680
can also get to.

00:26:31.698 --> 00:26:34.040
There's query parameters
which are described

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.598
in our documentation.

00:26:36.598 --> 00:26:38.838
And there's two flavors of
measurements that we support

00:26:38.838 --> 00:26:43.858
and I will go into more detail
about those in a moment.

00:26:43.858 --> 00:26:48.140
But before that I want to
talk about how you get

00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:50.880
authorized to use the API.

00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.040
We have a kind of
handshake process.

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.240
As I mentioned, a core design
principal of Power Meter

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.120
is that there's explicit
consent at every step.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:03.700
So that means that if you say
that you have some data on

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:07.900
behalf of Joe user and you want
to send it to us; well we're

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.060
not going to take it until we
are convinced that Joe user

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:12.960
actually wants you to send
it to us on your behalf.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.000
So the way that happens is that
there's a handshaking process

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.858
which is done online.

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:23.198
It starts with Joe user using
his web browser to go to either

00:27:23.198 --> 00:27:27.640
a utilitiy company's web
site or devices can have

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.160
their own web server.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.140
Or if you buy a device that's
web enabled you can go to the

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.740
device's manufacturer to begin
the process - the device

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.720
manufactuer's web site
to begin the process.

00:27:37.338 --> 00:27:40.318
Essentially you say:
begin enrolling.

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:45.318
Then you come to Power Meter
where you see an access cross

00:27:45.318 --> 00:27:48.598
site attack proof web page that
says: you are about to give

00:27:48.598 --> 00:27:52.278
your consent to receive data
for Power Meter, are you

00:27:52.278 --> 00:27:54.180
sure this is what you want?

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:55.778
And then when you say: yes.

00:27:57.138 --> 00:27:59.778
Joe user's browser will
redirect back to whoever it is

00:27:59.778 --> 00:28:01.220
that's trying to get access.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:04.400
That redirect is carrying
the token that they need.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:07.660
So that's how that
handshake begins.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.220
The user can break that
connection anytime.

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.238
There's a settings page in
Power Meter so they can see

00:28:12.238 --> 00:28:15.538
everyone they've given access
to and they can't say: nope,

00:28:15.538 --> 00:28:18.078
delete all my data or keep my
data but deauthroize

00:28:18.078 --> 00:28:19.760
future uplaods.

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.094
There's a lot of different
options that we suport.

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:27.880
We have kind of separate but
similar handshakes for three

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:29.620
different users of the API.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.180
Oh can I go back?

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.080
Oh I can go back.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:37.528
So there's one type of
handshake for if you are a

00:28:37.528 --> 00:28:40.040
utility company and you want
to get permission to write

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.260
to this separate zone.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:44.840
There's another type of
handshake for if you are a

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.400
device and you'd like to act
on behalf of the user and

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.280
write into their own zone.

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:51.340
Then there's a third type of
handshake which we're working

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:55.078
on now, coming soon, which will
be if you want to read the

00:28:55.078 --> 00:28:57.800
API on behalf of the user.

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:05.660
That handshake will support
things like getting

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:06.480
read-only access.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:11.118
So if you'd like to make a cool
visualization App, the user

00:29:11.118 --> 00:29:14.100
shouldn't give you permission
to write their data,

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.680
you don't need that.

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:22.680
There's a separate process for
getting read-only access.

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.058
The other thing I want to
go over really quickly

00:29:24.058 --> 00:29:25.358
is abuse measures.

00:29:25.358 --> 00:29:29.118
If you use the API the way kind
of our documentation describes,

00:29:29.118 --> 00:29:31.758
d you'll never find out that
the system has quota and

00:29:31.758 --> 00:29:33.338
throttling, but it does.

00:29:33.338 --> 00:29:38.420
So we recommend that you kind
of stay under our data rates

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:40.180
which are 6 data
points per hour.

00:29:40.858 --> 00:29:43.680
So every 10 minutes you
take a measurement and

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:44.420
you can send it to us.

00:29:44.618 --> 00:29:45.618
You can send it immediately.

00:29:45.618 --> 00:29:46.598
You don't have to delay it.

00:29:46.598 --> 00:29:51.424
You can do an immediate
HDP request to us as soon

00:29:51.424 --> 00:29:52.818
as you have the data.

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.118
We also have a storage quota.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.118
Right now at that data rate, we
give everybody years of space.

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.338
We're raising it all the time
just so that we make sure

00:30:01.338 --> 00:30:03.760
that we can stay ahead
of that data need.

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.460
As people send in more data,
we want to be able to

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.118
receive historical data.

00:30:08.118 --> 00:30:11.000
Not fifty years of historical
data but three years would be a

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.520
fine amount of historical data
to send us at maximum

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.818
data resolution.

00:30:15.818 --> 00:30:17.960
Which basically no
one actually has.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.058
Utility companies are still
kind of trying to get smart

00:30:21.058 --> 00:30:23.020
meters in place and they've
only had them for a while.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.498
There's very little, very old
high-resolution data out there.

00:30:29.498 --> 00:30:32.880
You can always send in low
resolution data and of course

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.940
that goes back many years.

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:37.480
We can receive that too.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.260
All the way back
to 1970 I think.

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:41.198
I can't imagine that it
actually works if you send

00:30:41.198 --> 00:30:43.480
us data older than 1970.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:47.980
Anyway, the beginning
of time as it were.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.920
As promised, I was going to
mention, in a little more

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:52.600
detail, the two flavors of
measurement that Power

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.660
Meter can receive.

00:30:55.300 --> 00:31:00.040
We supported both of these
flavors because different data

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.080
providers have this data
in different formats.

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:08.678
The two major ones are, first,
you may not know how a Power

00:31:08.678 --> 00:31:11.798
Meter, an electricity meter
works, like a really old

00:31:11.798 --> 00:31:12.098
one, it's kind of esoteric.

00:31:12.838 --> 00:31:16.720
Basically all its doing is its
just counting up at some rate.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.018
There's a single number,
there's just kind of kilowatt

00:31:19.018 --> 00:31:23.700
hours consumed since it was
installed or since it last

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:26.058
rolled over to ten thousand
or something like that.

00:31:26.058 --> 00:31:27.558
It's just a single number
and it gets bigger and

00:31:27.558 --> 00:31:28.140
bigger and bigger.

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.278
What that number is
doesn't matter.

00:31:30.278 --> 00:31:32.900
It's just the difference
between that number and then

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:35.298
the last time you measured
it, is what matters.

00:31:35.298 --> 00:31:39.858
So we can accept measurements
that are in this format.

00:31:39.858 --> 00:31:45.618
The way that works is, you send
us a time at which you got a

00:31:45.618 --> 00:31:48.700
reading -- we call that the
occur time -- and then a value,

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:50.140
which is the reading
that you took.

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:55.958
So the reading might be
236.24 kilowatt hours.

00:31:55.958 --> 00:31:58.318
That number doesn't mean
anything until you compare it

00:31:58.318 --> 00:32:01.420
to the measurement that
happened like one hour later,

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:05.680
and that one hour later might
be 237.4 kilowatt hours.

00:32:06.058 --> 00:32:10.498
That's how we deduce over that
hour you used about 1 kilowatt

00:32:10.498 --> 00:32:11.440
hour, so subtract them.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:16.320
So as you send us more and
more occur time value tuples.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.180
We just kind of notice the
difference between them and

00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:21.560
that's what we infer the
real measurement to be.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.000
And of course as I said,
the actually accumulated

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:25.440
number dosn't matter.

00:32:26.538 --> 00:32:29.818
But if you ever need to reset
it: like it goes back to zero

00:32:29.818 --> 00:32:33.940
or if you had a device that had
an accumulator and it lost

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.460
power and now you're
starting over.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.880
You can send us a little
marker, his initial.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:43.400
Which just indicates this is a
new accumulator value that

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.200
doesn't have any relationship
to the old one so please don't

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.800
think of it as a measurement
from the last one.

00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:55.000
So this data format is better
for if you're already going to

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.740
build an accmulator or if you
already have a smart meter that

00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.280
sends data in this format.

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:02.740
It's actually relatively
fragile for a

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.220
number of reasons.

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:06.800
The measures are all
kind of interdependent.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:12.040
If you end up mishandling this
little is initial marker, then

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:17.500
you accidentally create huge
spurious negative 2 million

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:22.078
kilowatt spikes in your data,
which you don't want to do.

00:33:22.038 --> 00:33:28.480
A more robust data format,
given that were using HTTPS

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:30.900
to communicate with Power
Meter, that's over TCP.

00:33:33.798 --> 00:33:34.900
There's not packet loss.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.260
The data either always comes
through or it always doesn't

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.460
and when it doesn't, you
know that it doesn't.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:44.660
So this style of measurement is
kind of designed to work with

00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.038
the lossy network which
utilities have but that

00:33:47.038 --> 00:33:49.480
you don't have with us.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.480
So a better form is this one.

00:33:53.758 --> 00:33:56.140
We call them durational
reads or interval reads.

00:33:56.958 --> 00:34:01.980
You basically just send when
you measured some time range.

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.500
It's not a moment,
its a range of time.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:10.558
For one measurement you might
say, from noon until one we

00:34:10.558 --> 00:34:12.920
measured 0.5 kilowatt hours.

00:34:13.558 --> 00:34:16.260
That measurement is
self-contained, and then we

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:21.338
register that as a rate of
usage over a period of time.

00:34:21.878 --> 00:34:23.158
Then you just send us
more and more of those.

00:34:23.158 --> 00:34:24.138
You can send them out of order.

00:34:24.138 --> 00:34:25.078
You can backdate them.

00:34:25.078 --> 00:34:28.158
You can overwrite
them if you want.

00:34:28.078 --> 00:34:32.880
That's how you express
what you measured to us.

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.278
And as I mentioned in the last
line we have a batch upload

00:34:35.278 --> 00:34:36.438
feed which you can see
in our documentation.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.660
If you don't want to just send
us one measurement every 10

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:46.018
minutes; utilities send us many
measurements across many users

00:34:46.018 --> 00:34:49.278
each 10 mintues so they will
use our batch feed for that.

00:34:49.218 --> 00:34:53.418
Its simply the same XML format
except instead of closing the

00:34:53.418 --> 00:34:56.298
connection, you just
send more of them.

00:34:56.298 --> 00:34:59.142
You can send up to a
thousand I think.

00:34:59.098 --> 00:35:03.320
And then of course we have
feeds that give access to

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.218
information about the user,
information about the variable,

00:35:06.218 --> 00:35:07.818
information about providers.

00:35:08.578 --> 00:35:13.038
Then coming soon, we sort of
call this raw API which is,

00:35:13.038 --> 00:35:15.320
these are the measurements
that you send us and then

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.360
you can get them back
by querying that API.

00:35:17.618 --> 00:35:21.378
You get back exactly
those measurments.

00:35:21.378 --> 00:35:23.478
But a very common thing is you
might send us measurements that

00:35:23.478 --> 00:35:25.158
are disjoint so they
might have gaps.

00:35:25.958 --> 00:35:27.860
You might send us
measurements that aren't

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:28.680
all the same length.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:33.478
A really common one is if
you send measurements for

00:35:33.478 --> 00:35:36.718
every day, well days don't
always have 24 hours.

00:35:36.718 --> 00:35:40.978
There's daylight savings time
and so you can have, kind of,

00:35:40.978 --> 00:35:41.760
varying length measurements.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.720
And if you want to build
something like charting, which

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:47.820
it turns out, we did, you
don't really want that.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:48.818
It's kind of clumsy.

00:35:48.818 --> 00:35:53.580
So what you need instead is
something that would smooth the

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:58.958
data into a kind of a fixed
interval measurement.

00:35:59.958 --> 00:36:01.318
You'd resample or
reinterpolate the data.

00:36:01.318 --> 00:36:04.318
You might want to pull out
features in the data.

00:36:04.978 --> 00:36:08.720
Notice the kind of always on
or base load rate of usage.

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:14.640
If you see a chart that's
spikey, the level of usage that

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:17.638
it never goes below, that's
the kind of always on rate.

00:36:17.638 --> 00:36:19.958
You might want to pull out
features like, me all

00:36:19.958 --> 00:36:21.738
the spikes in this data.

00:36:21.618 --> 00:36:25.138
So those are all examples of
things that the Power Meter

00:36:25.138 --> 00:36:27.160
computation engine is doing.

00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:30.790
We're looking at exposing those
back to you as an API so that

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:33.406
you can use some of the
calculations the Power

00:36:33.406 --> 00:36:35.276
Meter is doing anyway.

00:36:38.178 --> 00:36:42.280
When you go to read data from
Power Meter, as I mentioned we

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.480
have read only tokens which
make it possible for users to

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:48.718
authorize an application to
visualize the data or read the

00:36:48.718 --> 00:36:50.760
data but not to write the data.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.518
That's not an access level
that they want to give you.

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.680
It's a nice feature of the
system that they can give you

00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.760
a partial read-only access.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:05.260
Another type of partial access
is what were called scopes.

00:37:06.058 --> 00:37:12.678
This is a kind of an Auth sub
or oAuth concept which is that

00:37:12.678 --> 00:37:16.718
you can say: this token
represents my access but not to

00:37:16.718 --> 00:37:20.420
my entire account, only to this
variable or to this

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:21.780
list of variables.

00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:23.874
So that's what you use token
scopes for and there's kind

00:37:23.874 --> 00:37:27.078
of details on that in
our documentation.

00:37:27.078 --> 00:37:31.278
As I mentioned, we have this
sort of G Data API that gives

00:37:31.278 --> 00:37:34.260
raw access to the data.

00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.498
We have some python programs
that demonstrate how to use

00:37:36.498 --> 00:37:39.678
that raw API, both to write
to it and to read from it.

00:37:39.678 --> 00:37:43.020
So we have a little python
program -- if you check out co

00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:47.220
dot Google dot com -- that
pretends to be a device

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:50.818
measuring electricity
and sending data to us.

00:37:50.818 --> 00:37:53.198
And then sort of future API's
might have some of the things

00:37:53.198 --> 00:37:58.958
that I mentioned like
smoothing, charting,

00:37:58.958 --> 00:38:00.198
interesting feature
analysis center.

00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:05.658
Those are all things
that are coming.

00:38:05.658 --> 00:38:09.718
Documentation links up for your
reference: we're on co dot

00:38:09.718 --> 00:38:11.178
Goggle dot com under
the API's section.

00:38:14.518 --> 00:38:17.380
We're a little bit different
from other API's in that,

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:21.420
oftentimes our API partners
like potentially you, are

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:25.900
device manufacturers or utility
companies or utility data

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:27.520
aggregators or smart meter
providers so we have kind of a

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:32.600
separate set of guidelines for
how partners can work with us.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.260
We have kind of a
different package of

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:33.960
documentation for that.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.518
That's what you'll find
here at this second link.

00:38:37.958 --> 00:38:38.060
That's all I had.

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.460
If you have questions we've got
microphones -- I won't blind

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.400
you with this -- we've
got microphones in the

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.178
center of the asile.

00:38:44.178 --> 00:38:46.618
You can come on up
and ask questions.

00:38:46.618 --> 00:38:48.558
And if not -- oh
you do, alright.

00:38:48.558 --> 00:38:51.808
SRIKANTH: Go to the wave.

00:38:54.018 --> 00:38:56.562
RUS: Srikanth knows how
to work that wave, so

00:38:56.562 --> 00:38:58.078
I will let him do it.

00:38:58.078 --> 00:39:00.498
SRIKANTH: Let's go to
live questions first.

00:39:00.498 --> 00:39:02.718
AUDIENCE: Sorry, doing it
the old fashioned way.

00:39:02.998 --> 00:39:03.318
Thank you very much.

00:39:03.318 --> 00:39:06.718
I actually have several
questions and possibly

00:39:06.718 --> 00:39:07.718
even an offer.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.518
You mentioned a lot
about individual users.

00:39:11.518 --> 00:39:14.518
What about taking a community
or a pool of users and being

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:18.158
able to do work for
energy reduction?

00:39:18.158 --> 00:39:23.038
For instance, in climate
change calculations?

00:39:23.038 --> 00:39:26.100
RUS: So there are a few
different dimensions to

00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:26.340
how that could work.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:32.360
One feature that we have today
for example, is a user who's

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:36.260
got data on their behalf in
the system already can

00:39:36.260 --> 00:39:37.400
sort of make friends.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:39.240
They can share their
data with other users.

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.480
You can have a community of
people that all have individual

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.498
data and they're all
sharing it with each other.

00:39:45.498 --> 00:39:49.398
If you have a data stream
that represents, not

00:39:49.398 --> 00:39:52.878
for a particular user,
data for an aggregate?

00:39:52.878 --> 00:39:54.878
Like a whole town
or like a school?

00:39:54.878 --> 00:39:55.864
Is that what you're
talking about?

00:39:56.778 --> 00:39:58.498
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:39:56.658 --> 00:40:00.018
RUS: You could send that
data to like a shared

00:40:00.018 --> 00:40:01.280
Power Meter account.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:06.078
It would be analyzed as if it
was for a particular person.

00:40:07.418 --> 00:40:10.300
Some of the visualizations
we have would be less

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:10.938
appropriate for that.

00:40:11.958 --> 00:40:14.860
We have other ideas for
how communities can

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:15.180
use Power Meters.

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:19.958
For example, something that's
coming soon is, all the data

00:40:19.958 --> 00:40:21.298
that comes into Power
Meter is geo tagged.

00:40:21.298 --> 00:40:25.118
So we know, not exactly, but
sort of to the city, state

00:40:25.118 --> 00:40:27.418
regularity, we know where
its all coming from.

00:40:27.418 --> 00:40:31.378
It'll be easy for us to build
visualizations of this group

00:40:31.378 --> 00:40:34.998
of people or this community
that's near each other.

00:40:34.998 --> 00:40:37.698
Kind of here's their data
in total or how much

00:40:37.698 --> 00:40:37.898
they're saving.

00:40:37.898 --> 00:40:39.998
That kind of thing.

00:40:39.998 --> 00:40:41.958
AUDIENCE: I guess I'll just
broaden this since no

00:40:41.958 --> 00:40:42.498
one's else in line.

00:40:43.678 --> 00:40:44.638
My name's Scott [? Viskah ?].

00:40:44.978 --> 00:40:47.238
I live in Bozeman, Montana
and work with the climate

00:40:47.238 --> 00:40:49.198
change task force there.

00:40:50.098 --> 00:40:53.718
We have people on the task
force that include public

00:40:53.718 --> 00:40:54.760
utility commissions
from the state.

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:59.860
We have commissioner from
the county, city staff.

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:00.738
We have developers.

00:41:00.738 --> 00:41:03.198
We are the perfect test
model for you guys.

00:41:05.678 --> 00:41:08.400
We also have deployment
of our climate change

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.120
plan in about a year.

00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.840
We would love to be test bid if
we could come up with money to

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.918
get smart meters into
different places.

00:41:17.558 --> 00:41:19.860
This may be a
question for after.

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:21.538
Can I talk with you afterwards?

00:41:21.118 --> 00:41:22.480
RUS: Yeah, please.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:23.380
We're gonna stay around
a little bit after.

00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:27.860
Why don't you come on up and
give us you card at the end.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.060
We have business development
guys who would love

00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:30.920
to talk to you.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:34.058
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:34.058 --> 00:41:34.300
RUS: Sure, thank you.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.098
AUDIENCE: I'd like to thank
the previous questioner.

00:41:36.098 --> 00:41:39.660
I represent another
community in the building.

00:41:41.658 --> 00:41:42.030
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:41:42.030 --> 00:41:42.558
[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:42.558 --> 00:41:44.578
SRIKANTH: We can work
with all of you.

00:41:44.578 --> 00:41:46.518
AUDIENCE: I think there's
great synergy here.

00:41:46.518 --> 00:41:49.418
We're actually located, it's a
co-housing community being

00:41:49.418 --> 00:41:52.458
developed in downtown Mountain
View, just at Calderon.

00:41:52.458 --> 00:41:54.938
I'd like to talk to
you about that.

00:41:54.938 --> 00:41:55.798
RUS: Great.

00:41:55.078 --> 00:41:57.578
AUDIENCE: But drilling down
into the technicalities.

00:41:59.418 --> 00:42:02.108
There's a long history of
distributive measurement and

00:42:02.108 --> 00:42:05.818
process control in heterogenus
systems like this

00:42:05.818 --> 00:42:07.238
of various extents.

00:42:07.818 --> 00:42:14.458
One of the issues is in being
able to handle a large enough

00:42:14.458 --> 00:42:21.818
number of devices with a
tractable device taxonomy to be

00:42:21.818 --> 00:42:25.340
useful, but not burdensome.

00:42:26.138 --> 00:42:29.078
To capture the essence
of the devices that are

00:42:29.078 --> 00:42:30.538
within the use cases.

00:42:30.538 --> 00:42:35.018
Maybe you could comment on your
notion of device taxonomy.

00:42:35.018 --> 00:42:39.578
And then, dropping down to
issues that do relate to

00:42:39.578 --> 00:42:44.638
aggregation, namely issues of
dimensionality of the

00:42:44.638 --> 00:42:48.278
measurements, units, precision,
calibration; this kind of

00:42:48.278 --> 00:42:51.218
stuff that looks nice.

00:42:51.218 --> 00:42:53.418
The charts can look nice but
when you put error bars

00:42:53.418 --> 00:42:55.798
on them, these things
kind of go to hell.

00:42:56.098 --> 00:42:56.258
RUS: Sure.

00:42:56.858 --> 00:43:00.118
So the first part of your
question was about --

00:43:00.118 --> 00:43:00.418
SRIKANTH: Taxonomy.

00:43:01.618 --> 00:43:01.858
RUS: -- taxonomy.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:07.358
At a high level, we have a
couple of different fields

00:43:07.358 --> 00:43:11.300
in the API that you can use
that people are mostly not

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:12.078
taking advantage of now.

00:43:13.678 --> 00:43:16.818
The first thing that we
care about is, is it

00:43:16.818 --> 00:43:17.578
consumption or isn't it?

00:43:17.578 --> 00:43:19.910
So there's kind of the notion
of like, is it electricity

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:21.138
in kilowatt hours?

00:43:21.138 --> 00:43:24.138
Is it solar generated
in kilowatt hours?

00:43:24.138 --> 00:43:25.460
Is it gas?

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:26.158
Is it water?

00:43:26.158 --> 00:43:26.658
Those sorts of things.

00:43:26.658 --> 00:43:29.478
That's what's kind of
top-level segmentation.

00:43:29.478 --> 00:43:32.578
Right now we only accept
electricity data but it's

00:43:32.578 --> 00:43:34.938
trivial for us to extend
the platform to accept

00:43:34.938 --> 00:43:36.038
other kind of data.

00:43:36.038 --> 00:43:38.660
Within electricity -
sorry trivial for us

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:39.080
to accept and store.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.260
I should clarify that one the
reasons why we haven't is

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:46.980
because the way that you define
the user experience and the way

00:43:46.980 --> 00:43:49.420
you do the analysis around
something that's not

00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:50.920
electricity is very different.

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.000
So it's like yes it's all
measurement so that's easy to

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.260
store but if you want to show
it an interesting way -- show

00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:59.118
gas in an interesting way -- we
should think more carefully

00:43:59.118 --> 00:44:01.718
about that than just like slap
it on a chart and say: this is

00:44:01.718 --> 00:44:03.718
just like electricity
but in therms.

00:44:05.238 --> 00:44:07.578
That's not the right
way to show it.

00:44:07.578 --> 00:44:09.678
So drilling down into, once
we know that it's kind

00:44:09.678 --> 00:44:12.100
of electricity, is it
consumption is it not?

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:16.338
Then the other main kind of
pivot point is, is this

00:44:16.338 --> 00:44:17.018
kind of whole home?

00:44:17.018 --> 00:44:20.298
Or is this kind of a particular
device giving us only a

00:44:20.298 --> 00:44:24.340
portion of a narrowly
disaggregated read?

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.358
So that's the next kind of
major piece of the taxonomy

00:44:27.358 --> 00:44:28.438
that we care about.

00:44:29.018 --> 00:44:31.878
If it's whole home then we know
that it's a very noisy data

00:44:31.878 --> 00:44:34.300
stream that's got lots of
interesting stuff in it.

00:44:35.718 --> 00:44:39.420
It's worth applying
computational heuristics to try

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.018
to pull artifacts out of that.

00:44:42.478 --> 00:44:46.578
If we know that it's just one
device data stream: it's just a

00:44:46.578 --> 00:44:49.778
TV or just a air conditioner or
just a washing machine or

00:44:49.778 --> 00:44:52.238
something, then we treat
that data very differently.

00:44:53.378 --> 00:45:00.160
Beyond that you can imagine the
taxomony of appliances or smart

00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:06.218
cars or thermostat uploads
or something like that.

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:09.738
We have kind of a
first crack at that.

00:45:10.518 --> 00:45:12.978
We're planning to offer kind
of a user definable field.

00:45:12.978 --> 00:45:14.978
That's not available yet
in the API but that'll be

00:45:14.978 --> 00:45:17.078
kind of an extra level.

00:45:19.118 --> 00:45:23.178
At that level of detail the
API's still kind of forming.

00:45:23.178 --> 00:45:24.578
Does that speak to
your question?

00:45:24.578 --> 00:45:24.778
AUDIENCE: Yeah

00:45:24.778 --> 00:45:26.738
RUS: The second thing
you asked was.

00:45:28.438 --> 00:45:30.298
SRIKANTH: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:45:30.298 --> 00:45:31.458
RUS: Aggregation right.

00:45:31.458 --> 00:45:33.018
AUDIENCE: Or disaggregation.

00:45:33.018 --> 00:45:36.158
RUS: The API supports an
uncertainty field for

00:45:36.158 --> 00:45:37.738
every value you send.

00:45:37.738 --> 00:45:41.718
You, can, also send
an error bar.

00:45:41.718 --> 00:45:44.918
It's not defined what that
means but it's not a

00:45:44.918 --> 00:45:45.778
standard deviation.

00:45:45.778 --> 00:45:49.198
It's like min-max variance.

00:45:53.098 --> 00:45:57.540
You uplaod the unit with every
measurement and then the unit

00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:00.920
is always an SI unit in the
specific way that you express

00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:04.418
it so its like, kilowatt hours
is like, lowercase k big w

00:46:04.418 --> 00:46:08.498
space h and that's like
how we parce the unit.

00:46:08.498 --> 00:46:12.158
We carefully track the units
and if you send us different

00:46:12.158 --> 00:46:16.238
units then we convert them if
they're convertible and give

00:46:16.238 --> 00:46:18.088
you an error if they're
not convertible.

00:46:18.088 --> 00:46:18.948
That kind of thing.

00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:23.478
AUDIENCE: So what we're doing
is we're going to have a very

00:46:23.478 --> 00:46:25.438
sustainable community and
we're going to take on

00:46:25.438 --> 00:46:26.038
the automible as well.

00:46:26.518 --> 00:46:31.338
RUS: Thanks.

00:46:31.698 --> 00:46:37.958
AUDIENCE: I had a question
about when everyone in the

00:46:37.958 --> 00:46:40.098
world is hooked up to Google
Power Meter, how are you

00:46:40.098 --> 00:46:42.918
going to handle the
network bandwidths?

00:46:43.458 --> 00:46:45.138
Every fifteen minutes,
that's a lot of data and

00:46:45.138 --> 00:46:46.418
it comes very rapidly?

00:46:46.638 --> 00:46:51.280
Then the other thing is, when
people want to change their

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:55.318
behavior, it's more effective
if you give them the data, the

00:46:55.318 --> 00:46:57.718
feed back in real time, like
you turn the light switch on

00:46:57.718 --> 00:46:59.098
and you see the curve going up.

00:46:59.098 --> 00:47:02.498
But you have quite
a delay in there.

00:47:02.552 --> 00:47:02.658
It's not real time.

00:47:02.658 --> 00:47:04.218
It's just graphing what
exists from the past.

00:47:04.218 --> 00:47:05.138
RUS: Right.

00:47:06.498 --> 00:47:07.418
So those are both good points.

00:47:09.378 --> 00:47:12.040
First, about bandwidth
as we get more users.

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.198
Something we say internally in
the team is that we're excited

00:47:16.198 --> 00:47:18.458
to have that problem.

00:47:18.458 --> 00:47:23.518
There are a lot more efficient
ways to handle a lot of kind of

00:47:23.518 --> 00:47:29.538
near real time data than doing
HTDP, open TCP connection, OPEN

00:47:29.538 --> 00:47:34.698
SSL connection, send a verbose
thing of XML, close start over.

00:47:35.018 --> 00:47:36.338
It's really wasteful.

00:47:37.038 --> 00:47:40.638
XMPP is a way that
you can stream data.

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:46.160
Its more efficient on the
wire in exchange for more

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.400
state on either end.

00:47:48.458 --> 00:47:50.058
That's a tradeoff that we
could make where we could

00:47:50.058 --> 00:47:53.378
buy network using CPU.

00:47:56.038 --> 00:47:58.538
One of the reasons why the data
rate is as slow as it is which

00:47:58.538 --> 00:48:03.878
is, measurements every 10
minutes, is that with that

00:48:03.878 --> 00:48:09.140
measurement we can easily scale
up a couple million people.

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:14.460
Then the plan is to kind of
move to a higher bandwidth API

00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:19.398
that's more efficient and not
XML based, when we

00:48:19.398 --> 00:48:20.678
get to that level.

00:48:20.898 --> 00:48:24.778
The smart grid data is
ramping up pretty slowly

00:48:24.778 --> 00:48:27.538
so we had some runway.

00:48:27.538 --> 00:48:30.238
The second part of your
question was real time.

00:48:30.238 --> 00:48:33.860
So as I mentioned you could use
other alternative data formats

00:48:33.860 --> 00:48:38.480
like XMPP -- sorry transport
mechanisms -- like XMPP to make

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.300
real time data much
more efficient.

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:45.138
The other thing that I think is
important is, it is true that

00:48:45.138 --> 00:48:48.840
the Prius effect research
that's been to date is about

00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:52.038
real-time feedback but that's
not the only way you can save.

00:48:52.038 --> 00:48:54.340
One of the things we've noticed
with Power Meter for example,

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:58.898
is its common for devices to
have a little panel in your

00:48:58.898 --> 00:49:01.880
house where like, if you're in
your house and if you're

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:06.958
looking at it and if you do
some action and then that

00:49:06.958 --> 00:49:09.820
action has some obvious effect
on the panel, then you get

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:10.580
that real time feedback.

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.320
Power Meter is a
historical store right?

00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:17.138
So we are storing all this
historical data and we

00:49:17.138 --> 00:49:20.638
can analyze it over
a longer term trend.

00:49:21.658 --> 00:49:26.580
Not every savings opportunity
only comes from real-time.

00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:28.120
There are a lot of savings
opportunities that come from

00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.190
noticing patterns over time
and Power Meter does that.

00:49:34.818 --> 00:49:37.918
AUDIENCE: My utility does not
partner with you currently but

00:49:37.918 --> 00:49:41.758
they do provide their own
little web site and you can

00:49:41.758 --> 00:49:43.018
download the CSV files.

00:49:43.018 --> 00:49:44.258
So I'd like to --

00:49:44.258 --> 00:49:44.438
RUS: Sorry, what was
the name again?

00:49:44.438 --> 00:49:45.880
AUDIENCE: -- my name is Andrew.

00:49:46.420 --> 00:49:46.458
RUS: Oh.

00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:49.780
AUDIENCE: And my electric
company is [? Fijini. ?]

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:52.820
RUS: Oh right.

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:54.918
AUDIENCE: What I'd like to do
is just parce the CSV file and

00:49:54.918 --> 00:49:58.260
then upload it to you and then
I can view it from iGoogle.

00:49:58.818 --> 00:50:01.718
What are the barriers to that?

00:50:01.718 --> 00:50:03.158
Can I do that?

00:50:01.278 --> 00:50:01.838
SRIKANTH: None.

00:50:01.838 --> 00:50:05.398
In fact if you downlaod our
client library you'll see an

00:50:05.398 --> 00:50:08.378
example of, in fact even in the
developer forum that we have,

00:50:08.378 --> 00:50:09.878
there are people who are
starting to play with

00:50:09.878 --> 00:50:10.018
things like that.

00:50:12.018 --> 00:50:15.738
We do have a very simple
API example in the python

00:50:15.738 --> 00:50:20.320
script that is a pretty
easy to use thing.

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.658
The one thing you have to
be careful about is you

00:50:22.658 --> 00:50:24.638
will have to do this
authentication process.

00:50:24.638 --> 00:50:27.838
That is something that you may
have to build a simple web App

00:50:27.838 --> 00:50:30.618
for it where you essentially
gender the token.

00:50:32.178 --> 00:50:34.358
That should be not
that complicated.

00:50:34.058 --> 00:50:36.958
But it is technically feasible.

00:50:36.958 --> 00:50:37.158
The developer forum
has examples.

00:50:38.498 --> 00:50:39.558
There are a couple of
people who have built

00:50:39.558 --> 00:50:40.938
like a C Sharp library.

00:50:42.978 --> 00:50:45.058
But they are storing data
locally now in a MySQL

00:50:45.058 --> 00:50:49.178
database and then sending it
through a [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:50:49.178 --> 00:50:53.258
and sending it to us and that's
working, I would say well.

00:50:53.538 --> 00:50:57.458
RUS: It'd probalby be cleaner
if you worked with the python

00:50:57.458 --> 00:50:59.978
library but you could actually
use the sample python code.

00:50:59.978 --> 00:51:02.318
Just set and pipe and
then it would work.

00:51:02.318 --> 00:51:04.138
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:04.138 --> 00:51:04.838
RUS: Sure.

00:51:04.838 --> 00:51:05.098
Thank you.

00:51:05.578 --> 00:51:07.558
AUDIENCE: I came in a little
late but I gather you have

00:51:07.558 --> 00:51:12.038
general power use measurements
and power production

00:51:12.038 --> 00:51:14.158
case for solar panels.

00:51:14.158 --> 00:51:19.998
You also allow, for the future,
anyway, just devices, specific

00:51:19.998 --> 00:51:20.838
devices to upload data?

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:26.178
OK, so just an idea would be
also, a type of measurement to

00:51:26.178 --> 00:51:28.058
take would be the amount of
sun hitting solar panels.

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.060
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:34.438
You can't tell by the amount of
power they're producing whether

00:51:34.438 --> 00:51:36.618
they're dirty because you don't
know what the weather's like.

00:51:36.618 --> 00:51:37.438
You'd have to measure
the sunlight.

00:51:37.438 --> 00:51:37.698
RUS: Yeah

00:51:37.698 --> 00:51:39.678
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:51:39.678 --> 00:51:42.538
A kind of data to upload.

00:51:42.778 --> 00:51:46.640
RUS: There's a set of ancillary
data streams like when you do

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:52.378
measurements using inductive CT
clamps or if you are assessing

00:51:52.378 --> 00:51:54.158
the efficacy of your
solar insulation.

00:51:55.458 --> 00:51:58.658
You want to look at voltage and
then another metric which would

00:51:58.658 --> 00:52:01.040
be, you wanna look at
temperature or you wanna

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:01.080
look at sunglight.

00:52:04.458 --> 00:52:07.664
We do not currently accept
measurement types other

00:52:07.664 --> 00:52:08.822
than electricity,
but we easily could.

00:52:09.486 --> 00:52:12.554
That's something that
we'll be looking at as

00:52:12.554 --> 00:52:12.840
we integrate solar.

00:52:13.158 --> 00:52:15.198
AUDIENCE: Cause you look at the
weather map but that doesn't

00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:18.980
account for the trees in a
particular place or something.

00:52:18.718 --> 00:52:19.500
SRIKANTH: Just an example.

00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:24.218
This is not my data but one
of our team members has a

00:52:24.218 --> 00:52:26.258
solar panel in the house.

00:52:26.258 --> 00:52:27.558
We recently allowed
people to send us data.

00:52:27.738 --> 00:52:31.558
This is generation data and its
very useful for people who have

00:52:31.558 --> 00:52:34.146
solar panels to understand, a I
producing the electricty as

00:52:34.146 --> 00:52:34.920
I'm expected to produce?

00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:38.338
Its starting to give a good
sense for, is something

00:52:38.338 --> 00:52:38.698
occluding it.

00:52:39.418 --> 00:52:44.638
It's definitely starting to
help diagnose and get that.

00:52:44.638 --> 00:52:47.858
Last one and then we have to
get to the wave build also.

00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:51.280
AUDIENCE: I'm actually
on the wave.

00:52:51.280 --> 00:52:54.000
My name is Ray Ortiz,
I'm from UC Berkeley.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:54.420
RUS: Oh great! 2 birds
with one stone.

00:52:56.478 --> 00:52:58.800
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
if there's a way to

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.760
create a virtual meter.

00:53:02.378 --> 00:53:05.698
You collect the data, I have a
bunch of meters in my house

00:53:05.698 --> 00:53:09.178
that are all publishing to
Google and then I can create a

00:53:09.178 --> 00:53:14.158
process that collects that data
and makes that available, a

00:53:14.158 --> 00:53:17.518
digest of it available, to
someone that I can share

00:53:17.518 --> 00:53:18.458
it with or something.

00:53:19.938 --> 00:53:21.718
Effectively a virtual meter.

00:53:21.718 --> 00:53:22.978
SRIKANTH: So you'll have you do
the aggregation externally for

00:53:22.978 --> 00:53:27.518
now, but we're trying to, kind
as we're exploring ways to go

00:53:27.518 --> 00:53:29.958
beyond just like whole house
or device appliances.

00:53:31.058 --> 00:53:32.498
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:53:32.498 --> 00:53:34.918
within, we also have ways to do
the aggregation but for now

00:53:34.918 --> 00:53:37.820
you'll do the aggregation
outside and send it as one

00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:38.480
variable or data stream.

00:53:41.358 --> 00:53:43.598
AUDIENCE: Would the virtual
meter then look like any

00:53:43.598 --> 00:53:44.838
other one of my meters?

00:53:44.198 --> 00:53:45.558
SRIKANTH: It'll be an
aggregated view of

00:53:45.558 --> 00:53:46.918
all the meters.

00:53:47.118 --> 00:53:48.418
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:53:48.418 --> 00:53:54.018
In fact we have a device
partner that sells individual

00:53:54.018 --> 00:53:55.218
plug level devices.

00:53:55.300 --> 00:53:59.358
What they do is, they have
individual plugs all streaming

00:53:59.358 --> 00:54:00.978
data to their service first
where they aggregate

00:54:00.978 --> 00:54:03.418
it and they send one
consolidated stream.

00:54:04.138 --> 00:54:06.438
They also have the individual
streams in addition to that,

00:54:06.438 --> 00:54:08.702
so if they want to diagnose,
that's also feasible.

00:54:09.658 --> 00:54:11.998
Let's quickly jump into some of
the questisons on the wave.

00:54:11.998 --> 00:54:13.078
What incentives do
utilities have?

00:54:13.078 --> 00:54:16.498
That's an excellent question
and we're trying very very hard

00:54:16.498 --> 00:54:19.318
to make utlitites understand
what value we provide.

00:54:19.318 --> 00:54:21.118
I think the biggest
value proposition is

00:54:21.118 --> 00:54:22.618
cusotomer engagement.

00:54:23.578 --> 00:54:28.598
I have almost never gone to the
website that I think one of the

00:54:28.598 --> 00:54:31.758
audience members mentioned on
looking at how much I'm using.

00:54:32.658 --> 00:54:34.418
I would love to be able
to get to this data

00:54:34.418 --> 00:54:35.958
without any effort.

00:54:35.098 --> 00:54:37.638
I'm not going to make
the effort to go to

00:54:37.638 --> 00:54:38.498
another website.

00:54:38.878 --> 00:54:41.018
If it is something that I can
get to have as part of my

00:54:41.018 --> 00:54:42.138
doing research or doing
other [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:54:42.138 --> 00:54:45.158
calucations on a day to day
basis, that's useful to me.

00:54:46.058 --> 00:54:48.798
Utilities do need this way to
connect to the customers.

00:54:48.798 --> 00:54:53.580
We feel like this is an easy
low cost almost no cost effort

00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:56.760
on their part to be able
to connect with the user.

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:59.160
We think that's the high value
propositon and especially

00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:01.880
as the smartBridge
roll out goes out.

00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:05.100
There's a lot of complexity
that is on the horizon like

00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:06.260
we're talking about
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:06.560
pricing.

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:09.980
We're talking about more
sophisticated controls.

00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:14.092
A lot of it can be made more
user friendly if you're able to

00:55:14.092 --> 00:55:16.760
show the people the data before
they start seeing

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:17.000
the impact of it.

00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:21.220
We feel education and
engagement is probably a

00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:21.698
key value propostion.

00:55:22.658 --> 00:55:28.478
How have utilities imposed
restrictions on data sharing?

00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:32.940
Our fundamental philosophy
is data is the users data.

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:35.980
While the utility is collecting
it, once the user has given

00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:38.140
permission to give it into
Power Meter, it is the users

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:41.998
data and they control
who has access to it.

00:55:41.238 --> 00:55:44.378
When I'm sharing my
data, I'm not taking

00:55:44.378 --> 00:55:46.118
anybody's permission.

00:55:46.478 --> 00:55:50.958
I'm essentially exposing
it from my perspective.

00:55:51.238 --> 00:55:54.758
At this point there are no
restrictions but clearly this

00:55:54.758 --> 00:55:55.838
is a pretty delicate topic.

00:55:55.838 --> 00:55:58.220
And especially as some of the
discussions on how does

00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:00.598
smartBridge roll outs go out,
it might obviously

00:56:00.598 --> 00:56:01.358
be influenced.

00:56:01.358 --> 00:56:03.038
We are very very active on
the policy front also.

00:56:03.038 --> 00:56:05.678
In addition to obviously
building the product, I would

00:56:05.678 --> 00:56:09.658
say a third of energy goes in
just working with the policy

00:56:09.658 --> 00:56:13.498
and the federal programs which
are trying to lay the standards

00:56:13.498 --> 00:56:13.760
and the ground rules on this.

00:56:15.578 --> 00:56:18.798
Things will change and we'll
stay up with it but we do at

00:56:18.798 --> 00:56:21.408
this point, very strongly
believe in our permanent

00:56:21.408 --> 00:56:23.240
philosophy as, the user should
decide what happens with

00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:26.658
the data and they should
drive it going forward.

00:56:26.658 --> 00:56:30.878
How much control does the API
give you with granularity

00:56:30.878 --> 00:56:32.078
of data sharing?

00:56:32.158 --> 00:56:33.800
Right now its all or nothing.

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.660
When Rus shared, he shared
all of his data with me.

00:56:39.660 --> 00:56:42.380
Likewise when I share my
data, all of my data, so all

00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:43.898
my variables get shared.

00:56:44.958 --> 00:56:47.598
We are trying to see whether
people find it more interesting

00:56:47.598 --> 00:56:48.110
if we will share parts of it.

00:56:49.298 --> 00:56:51.930
Again, it should be a filtering
process which should not be

00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:54.806
that hard to implement but
its not currently supported.

00:56:54.822 --> 00:56:57.578
Feed requesters
in the Bay Area.

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.660
Unfortunately, the options in
the Bay Area are to kind of

00:57:01.660 --> 00:57:04.000
look at home energy
management devices.

00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.860
There are a slew of those
coming in the market.

00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:08.960
A lot of very innovative
start-ups in the space

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:11.558
which are trying to do
creative applications.

00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:16.138
Some of you, if you're
interested, just about a couple

00:57:16.138 --> 00:57:18.238
of days back, Tweetawatt which
is a variation of kilowatt.

00:57:21.178 --> 00:57:24.718
A couple of developers have
built out a very easy

00:57:24.718 --> 00:57:26.330
integration so if you have a
Tweetawatt device you can

00:57:26.330 --> 00:57:29.698
pretty much get a $50, $60
device and get it to

00:57:29.698 --> 00:57:30.338
talk to Power Meter.

00:57:30.878 --> 00:57:34.038
And there are more
coming on the horizon.

00:57:34.238 --> 00:57:39.118
In terms of utilities we are
actively pursuing having more

00:57:39.118 --> 00:57:41.478
utilities work with us but
clearly its a complex space

00:57:41.478 --> 00:57:43.878
to navigate and work with.

00:57:43.878 --> 00:57:48.378
We're hoping we'll get more
utilities with us but it'll

00:57:48.378 --> 00:57:49.782
take time to get there.

00:57:49.938 --> 00:57:54.840
RUS: And PG&amp;E specifically,
we're always talking to them.

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.860
We're continuing to learn
about the barriers on

00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:58.800
their side to adapting.

00:57:58.800 --> 00:57:59.800
SRIKANTH: We're trying hard.

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:04.958
I think we already answered the
last one so, if there are no

00:58:04.958 --> 00:58:07.578
other questions, we'll be
around to continue chatting

00:58:07.578 --> 00:58:10.598
and take it from there.

00:58:10.598 --> 00:58:11.922
Thanks everyone.

00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:10.840
