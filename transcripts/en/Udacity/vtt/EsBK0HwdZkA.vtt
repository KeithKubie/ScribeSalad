00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.410
You should have a better grasp on how to
use the material design guidelines to

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.360
make your app designs more immersive,
more bold, and more graphic.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.310
&gt;&gt; We began the lesson with
a brief discussion of the Gestalt

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.950
principle of grouping.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.320
We used it to add space to our designs,
and make them more easily scannable and

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.370
more quickly comprehensible.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.940
&gt;&gt; Next was a discussion of color,
and how to create a color palette for

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.790
a brand and apply it to an app.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:27.310
Then we discussed typography, and

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.530
how a clear hierarchy in type imbues
meaning into your user interface.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.930
&gt;&gt; Last, we talked about imagery,
and learned how to pick photos and

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.440
illustrations that
are relevant to our users,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.170
provided important information,
and were a delight to see.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.820
&gt;&gt; Stay tuned for the next lesson,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.770
where we'll talk about choreographing
the movement of digital paper and

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.060
ink through this concept
we call meaningful motion.
