(dramatic music)

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.049
(sobs)

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.056
- You're awake from your coma

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:26.559
Hallelujah , it's a miracle!

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:27.394
- Baby.

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:29.228
What's this book?

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:31.063
- Oh, I pray now.

00:00:31.063 --> 00:00:33.098
Oh yes, and I saw my rosary.

00:00:33.098 --> 00:00:36.402
Since you were in this
coma, a lot has changed.

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:37.237
Sign this.

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:40.539
Is this divorce papers?

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.408
- How do you expect me to
marry the love of my life

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:44.043
without a divorce from you?

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:44.978
- Hey, babe. Look.

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:46.045
I'm trending on Snapchat.

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:47.580
- Ah, that's great, baby.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.583
Because we'll be chattin'
about my snatch tonight.

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:51.417
Oh yeah.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:52.919
- What is Snapchat?

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:54.553
How old is that kid?

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:55.754
- Don't you worry about it.

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:57.089
He gave me three
beautiful children.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:58.658
More than what you could do.

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:00.092
- He gave you children?

00:01:00.092 --> 00:01:02.295
That seems very quick.

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:03.562
(sighs)

00:01:03.562 --> 00:01:05.498
Baby, we're supposed to
stay together forever,

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:06.966
like Brad and Angie.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:09.235
- Oh shit, honey,
they even split up.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.069
- No they didn't!

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:11.304
- Yes they did.

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:11.837
- [Man] No they didn't!
- [Woman] Yes they did.

00:01:11.837 --> 00:01:13.172
- Why?

00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:14.606
Well, at least they're gonna be

00:01:14.606 --> 00:01:15.741
sharing custody of those kids.

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:16.976
I know that for a fact,

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:18.945
'cause there is a lot
of love in that house.

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.946
- Actually, Angelina
wants full custody

00:01:20.946 --> 00:01:21.781
(shouts)

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.149
- You're killing me!

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:24.149
Why?

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.353
Brad Pitt is the perfect human.

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:28.787
- Would you grow up?

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:31.457
Breakups happen. Now
sign the damn papers.

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:33.793
- Yeah, I'll sign
these damn papers.

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:36.095
But it is gonna take a lot

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:38.497
of One Direction ballads

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:41.134
to get over these two breakups.

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:43.302 align:start size:88% position:13%
- No it ain't, One
Direction broke up too.

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:45.472
(beeping)

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:49.508 align:start size:84% position:16%
Ah, hell to the
no. Wake yo ass up.

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:50.476
You, no.

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:51.611
- Stand back, are you his wife?

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:52.645
- Yes, still!

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:56.015
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:57.116
Go, go to the light.

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:58.218
Go to the light!
