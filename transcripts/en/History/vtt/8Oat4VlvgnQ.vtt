00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:04.629
- This is Woodhenge.

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:08.383
This was a smaller
monument consisting

00:00:08.383 --> 00:00:13.179
of six concentric
rings of wooden posts

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:19.519
that pointed up towards the
sky as much as 4,000 years ago.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.565
And this monument itself
being circular in the same way

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:28.069
that Stonehenge was
suggests to us that the 19

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:32.323
stones around the
edge of Durrington

00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:36.453
was a huge great circle
in itself, the largest

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:39.205
ring of stones
anywhere in Europe,

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:40.415
perhaps even in the world.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.589
NARRATOR: Incredibly, the newly
discovered Superhenge hedge

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:50.467
is not all that has been
uncovered beneath the earth

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:52.010
here.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.473
Since July 2010, an
international team of experts,

00:00:56.473 --> 00:01:00.518
as part of the Stonehenge
Hidden Landscapes Project,

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:04.939
has been mapping the entire area
using the latest technology.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.903
More than 15 underground
sites have been found.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.946
The landscape
around Stonehenge

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:15.575
is actually archeologically
very, very rich.

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:18.578
Rather than Stonehenge
being this monument that

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:22.749
sits by itself in Salisbury
Plain, what has been revealed

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:27.587
is that it is part of a
vast sacred landscape that

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:30.590
once covered Salisbury
Plain and went all

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.803
the way down to the river Avon.

00:01:34.803 --> 00:01:37.847
MAN: There's no doubt that
these finds will cause

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:40.642
English archeologists to
have to revisit everything

00:01:40.642 --> 00:01:42.143
we know about Stonehenge.

00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:44.312
Because Stonehenge is not
going to be considered

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:47.190
an isolator, something
that's curious.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.401
NARRATOR: While mainstream
scientists believe Stonehenge

00:01:50.401 --> 00:01:53.988
and its surrounding sites
were ancient ritual and burial

00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:56.407
grounds, there is
no written record

00:01:56.407 --> 00:02:00.662
to explain why ancient people
chose to move and erect

00:02:00.662 --> 00:02:05.291
massive blocks that weigh
up to 50 tons, some of which

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:09.754
were transported from
over 100 miles away.

00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:12.882
And now that a second
Stonehenge has been found,

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:16.678
the theory that these sites
were simply burial grounds

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:20.306
has been thrown into
greater question.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:21.808
DAVID WHITEHEAD:
These ancient people

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.810
had a great deal of
knowledge about how to align

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.271
these structures perfectly.

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:29.315
So we're dealing with an
advanced civilization,

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.067
to say the least.

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:33.027
Where they had that knowledge,
where they got that knowledge,

00:02:33.027 --> 00:02:35.405
where they developed
the ability to put these

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.949
incredible monuments together--

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.535
it boggles the mind.

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:44.080
NARRATOR: Archeologists believe
that Stonehenge's two rings

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.251
of standing stones may be simply
the remains of a much larger

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:51.379
structure, based on the
presence of the earthen

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.589
hedge that surrounds it.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.679
This has led to speculation
that Superhenge also contained

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:03.016
additional rings, and that
these structures might

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:07.395
even have had walls and roofs.

00:03:07.395 --> 00:03:11.774
But if true, was this area of
England much more than simply

00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:14.861
a site of religious ceremony?

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.238
When we look to these
extraordinary structures

00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:20.575
on Earth, it makes you
wonder, did extraterrestrials

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:24.120
have a hand in creating
these massive monuments,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.666
or did they teach humans how
to build these monuments?

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:32.420
So you have to wonder what
the purpose of these giant stone

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.590
circles are around the world?

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.258
It's impossible
they were some kind

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:39.761
of spaceport or conceived city.

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:47.310
NARRATOR: Is it
possible that Stonehenge

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.854
and the many structures
that surround it

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:54.150
are the remnants of an
extraterrestrial spaceport?
