00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:22.590
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.150
I now have the pleasure

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.370
of introducing our
next keynote speaker,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.740
Professor Jane Ginsburg.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.340
She will be talking about
the most moral of rights,

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.330
the right to be recognized
as the author of the work.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.900
Jane really needs
no introduction

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.390
but I will give you a brief one.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.230
She is the Morton L.
Janklow Professor of Literary

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.450
and Artistic Property Law at
Columbia University School

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.130
of Law and Faculty Director
of its Kernochan Center

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.310
for Law, Media and the Arts.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.300
I think she's been extensively
quoted on moral rights

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.470
so we are very, very pleased
to have her here today.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.310
She's also my former
copyright professor

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.460
so I'm really excited
to have her as well.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.800
Thank you.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.510
With that I'll turn
it over to Jane.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:10.510
[ Applause ]

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.530
[ Silence ]

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.560
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much Karyn
and I'm honored to be introduced

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.640
by a former student
and thank you very much

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.060
to the Copyright Office
and to George Mason

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.340
for having invited
me to give this talk.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.890
The French revolutionary
legislator, Le Chapelier,

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.560
famously declared of all
properties the most sacred,

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.260
the most legitimate,
the least attackable

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.670
and if I may say the most
personal is the right the author

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.060
has in the fruits of his labor.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.140
Descending from those rhetorical
and foreign heights I can affirm

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.670
that the most moral, the most
intuitive author's right is the

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.530
right to be recognized as
the creator of her works.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.970
In fact most non-copyright
experts,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.770
in other words ordinary folk,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.990
think that authors
do enjoy the right

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.380
to be credited for their works.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.900
Of all the many counterintuitive
features of U.S. copyright law,

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.540
and they abound, the lack

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.040
of an attribution right may
present the greatest gap

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.940
between perceived
justice and reality.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.360
Even entities whose relationship
to copyright is ambivalent

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.190
for example Creative Commons,
make attribution a default

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.410
in their parallel
copyright universe.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.010
Another example, many who lack
enthusiasm for paying authors

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.560
such as many online
platforms, pick your favorite,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.510
query who needs money when
free distribution gives authors

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.070
great exposure.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.450
Exposure however implies
credit for the work

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.160
and of course we have assumed
an international obligation

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.350
to credit authors.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.740
The United States I believe is
the only country including among

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.970
common law countries not

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.680
to include attribution
rights in its copyright law.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.970
Whether or not we can get
away with non-implementation

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.410
of Berne obligations
it is not a good thing

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.910
to be an international scofflaw.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.600
Before I address the positive
law and future prospects

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.240
for moral rights in the United
States let's consider some

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.870
arguments for why our
copyright law should not include

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.190
enforceable attribution
rights and I will say

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.770
that I'll invoke three reasons,

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.400
one theoretical and
two practical.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.870
The theoretical one one
might put under the rubric

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.270
of post-modernism

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:21.060
that attribution rights
overvalue authorship,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.710
that they are a vestige
of the romantic conception

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.220
of authorship and
since we don't believe

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.280
in that anymore we
shouldn't believe

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.450
in attribution rights either
and there are variations

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:37.490
on that theme with which
I imagine you're familiar.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.550
The second argument I'll call
the slippery slope argument,

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.210
that is attribution rights might
be okay but they will lead us

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.100
to integrity rights and we
don't want integrity rights

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.550
because among other things they
limit other authors' creativity

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.490
or for that matter the leeway

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.820
that producers enjoy
to revise works.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.350
Now how do we get from
that slippery slope?

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.380
It's actually not the right
of attribution, it's the right

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.270
to prevent false attribution

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.450
that can lead to
integrity rights.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.440
Think of the Monty Python case

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.550
that Peter Yu evoked
earlier this morning.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.010
There the right to prevent
association of the name

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:33.080
with a work that Monty Python
didn't create because it was

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:40.480
so very much altered was
rendered enforceable briefly

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.510
under 43(a) -

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.010
[ Background Noise ]

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:47.040
[ Laughter ]

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.490
&gt;&gt; All right, of course we
have a little Dastar problem

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.050
that we'll evoke
later but I think

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.460
that analytically the right
to prevent false attributes,

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.830
not actually a moral right even
though many common law countries

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.310
include that in their
moral rights provision

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.840
because the right to prevent
false attribution is the right

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.630
to prevent the association
of your name

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.680
with the work you didn't create.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.900
What moral rights are about is
the association of your name

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.390
with the work you did create.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.470
Nonetheless if you're
going to have both sides

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.210
of the coin then you can see how
the argument towards integrity

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.460
rights gets constructed.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.970
The third argument is
the most practical of all

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.430
which is it's simply
too difficult

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:42.130
to implement an attribution
right in practice.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.740
Think of the mess in our current
case law about who is an author

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.590
and that's even without
the prospect

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:56.380
of having an attribution right
for actual creators regardless

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.860
of whether or not
the work is for hire

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.010
so you have the multiplicity
of potential authors,

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.120
how are you supposed to
recognize all of them,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.280
how are you going to decide

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.840
which ones should be recognized
even if you could recognize all

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.960
of them that would end
up meaning tiny print

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.760
or endless film credits
that nobody looks at anyway

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.020
so it's not going to
do authors any good.

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.250
Now I think that
there are some answers

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:30.810
to the practical objections
that I will address in the rest

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:37.540
of this talk so let me
first start with the sources

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.550
of attribution rights.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.370
Some of these have
been already evoked.

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.450
There are international norms.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:48.380
There is the current state
of U.S. copyright law,

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:52.140
VARA and copyright
management information.

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:56.440
I've put in brackets various
private ordering solutions.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.180
Can everybody see the slides?

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.900
And I believe there will be a
panel this afternoon talking

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.960
about private ordering
solutions and then I'll talk

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:11.070
about potential sources
in the U.S. copyright law

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.630
for the attribution right.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.260
Starting with international
norms.

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:22.160
Daniel and others have already
evoked Berne Article 6bis

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:29.110
and that includes the right to
claim authorship of the work.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.570
Now for reasons that will
become apparent I think

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:36.730
that there is a more important
source from U.S. point of view

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:40.690
of attribution rights and that's
Berne Convention Article 10.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.720
This is the quotation
right that provides

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.520
that it shall be permissible.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.220
So this is not an
option to states to allow

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:54.480
for quotation rights, this
is a direction to allow

00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:01.560
for quotation rights subject to
a variety of conditions provided

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.990
that they're making these
compatible with fair practice

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:07.800
so their extent does not exceed
that justified by the purpose.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:12.330
This text precedes Article
9(2) in the three-step test

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.850
which echoes some of
these considerations.

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.040
Most importantly
however where use is made

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.330
of the works mention shall
be made of the source

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:26.990
and of the name of the
author if it appears thereon.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:32.000
So if you're copyright law
includes quotation rights

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.940
which it is supposed to
then there is an obligation

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.810
to include the name of the
author if the author appears

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.230
on the source of the quotation.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:45.910
So a couple of questions.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:51.210
First of all the three-step test
doesn't say anything explicit

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.580
about attribution rights.

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:58.050
What's the relationship
between 10(3) and 9(2)?

00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:02.490
I would say that 9(2)
does not override 10(3).

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:07.850
10(3) is more specific and
it's apparent when one goes

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:13.520
through the drafting history
of the various iterations

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:19.560
of the Berne Convention that the
three-step test was not intended

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:24.880
to override the obligation to
mention the name of the author

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.450
in the quotation right.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:33.690
I could also point out that the
third step does not unreasonably

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:36.210
prejudice the legitimate
interests of the author.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:40.750
It's fully compatible with
an attribution obligation.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:43.780
Of course one could say that
not crediting the author

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:47.770
unreasonably prejudices the
author's legitimate interest

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:53.410
but there's still a problem
within the Berne Convention

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:57.720
which is Berne does not
define who is an author

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.190
and in fact there are reasonable
arguments although there is

00:11:02.190 --> 00:11:05.310
reasonable disagreement
that the question

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:10.320
of who is an author is left to
national legislation and so work

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.680
for hire is not necessarily
incompatible

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.280
with the Berne Convention.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:21.490
If that is true then that could
mean that the beneficiaries

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:26.230
of these mandatory attribution
rights would be limited

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:29.910
to nonemployee authors.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:35.380
Now, TRIPS has been
mentioned a couple of times

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:38.510
that are the moral rights

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.840
in the Berne Convention not
enforceable through TRIPS.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:47.420
Here's the text that says so and
that's how come we have managed

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:52.700
to get away with not actually
implementing article 6bis

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:59.520
but I would like to argue that
the attribution obligation

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:06.020
through article 10(3) is not
a right derived from 6bis

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:10.460
and since the carveout is 6bis
and rights derived therefrom

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:13.240
if the attribution obligation

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.720
that accompanies the
quotation right is not derived

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.310
from 6bis it's enforceable

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:22.970
through a WTO dispute
resolution proceeding

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:25.840
and so takeaway number
one from this talk,

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:29.410
the attribution right is
enforceable in the context

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:33.330
of the quotation right
and I would be delighted

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.820
if some government,
France or otherwise,

00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:37.480
would like to bring an action

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:41.750
against the United States
[laughter] for nonenforcement

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.810
of that enforceable obligation.

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:48.890
&gt;&gt; We are not encouraging
that however [laughter].

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:51.910
&gt;&gt; Yes, Karyn and I had
a few back and forths

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:53.820
about the description
of this talk.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:57.410
The version that is

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:02.800
in the brochure is a little
more vigorous than the original,

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:06.040
well not my original but the
Copyright Office's original

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:09.050
description and Karyn
wanted to make sure

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:11.620
that the Copyright
Office was not tarred

00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:14.050
with my attribution
radicalism [laughter].

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:15.020
&gt;&gt; We are in full compliance

00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:17.510
with our international
obligations.

00:13:17.510 --> 00:13:21.220
[ Laughter ]

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:26.490
&gt;&gt; Okay, now as I mentioned
United States is an outlier not

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:30.360
only with respect to those
suspect civil law countries

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.590
but also with respect
to common law countries.

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:39.450
Every common law country has
an attribution obligation

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:44.370
in connection with copyright
exceptions such as fair dealing

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.880
which is not quite fair use
but there's some similarities

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.260
and some other copyright
exceptions as well subject

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.970
to a reasonableness proviso

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:58.510
but nonetheless everybody
else has such an obligation.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:03.340
I'll also point out that
the European Union has not

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:05.380
harmonized moral rights

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:10.640
but in the Orphan Works
Directive there is a provision,

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:15.310
Article 6(3) that
requires the name --

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.360
, including the name
of an identified author

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.090
if the work is disseminated

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.540
under the EU orphan
works regime.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:27.250
So that's the international
landscape,

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.440
how about in the United States?

00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.110
As you can see I don't think
much of VARA and I'm going

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:37.710
to explain why I don't think
much of VARA for this purpose.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:42.030
Now Section 409(b) is
interesting because it does say

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:45.280
that the author's
name shall appear

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.680
on the registration
information however

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.810
that probably means
the statutory author

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:54.240
and therefore this
is not a source

00:14:54.240 --> 00:15:00.710
of attribution information
for nonemployee authors

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.340
and then the other
possible locust

00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.460
for attribution rights is
copyright management information

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:13.860
so let me talk about both
VARA and section 1202.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:19.550
So the definition of a work of
visual art is extremely narrow.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:23.940
There are very, very few
works that actually qualify

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:26.150
for attribution rights

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:33.050
and probably the most
significant limitation for works

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:38.550
that potentially qualify is
the requirement with respect

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:42.370
to photographs that they be
a still photographic image

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:45.140
produced for exhibition
purposes only.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:47.640
I don't think that
such a category exists.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.330
It didn't exist in 1990.

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:53.310
Maybe that has been created
for purposes of compliance

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.100
or qualifying under
VARA but it's a sort

00:15:56.100 --> 00:16:01.630
of a strange category and
in any event would be --

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:06.010
, the image would be
protected only to the extent

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.130
that it fell within
this category.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:13.980
Any additional images if they
didn't disqualify the photograph

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:19.200
entirely would in any event
not be covered by VARA

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.550
and this becomes clear
when you then look

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.750
at the scope of protection.

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:29.820
You have the right to claim
authorship of that work

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:32.040
but it has to be a work
of visual art, a very,

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.300
very narrow category, to prevent
the use of his or her name

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.710
as the author of any work
of visual art which he

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:43.940
or she did not create but that's
not a general false attribution

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.750
provision because
it only applies

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:50.510
to putting the author's name
on another "work of visual art"

00:16:50.510 --> 00:16:58.600
so very narrow in application
and with respect to the tie-in

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.860
between attribution and
integrity again it's limited

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:06.280
to that very small
category of works

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.780
so this plays out as follows.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:12.850
There's no attribution right
for any work that doesn't come

00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:16.580
under the narrow
definition of VARA.

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:21.910
If the author's name
is put on an artwork

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.450
that she didn't create
but it doesn't fall

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:30.340
within the narrow category so
it's not a photograph produced

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:35.190
for exhibition purposes only
for example there's no right

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:37.830
and of course there's no claim

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:43.350
for the reputation harming
distortions of the work

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:47.720
if the work doesn't qualify
as a work of visual art

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.730
so it's a tiny, tiny universe.

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:52.000
Is there -

00:17:56.010 --> 00:17:59.920
It's a tiny universe that
might have bad ripple effects

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:01.920
as a result of the
Dastar decision.

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:06.370
This is the case that all moral
rights advocates love to hate

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:10.030
for reasons that I think Peter
Yu has already made clear

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.790
but let me add one more.

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:15.880
There is a suggestion in
Justice Scalia's opinion

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:23.750
of a preemptive effect that the
only affirmative attribution

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:28.970
rights that we have in the
copyright law are in VARA

00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:32.800
and well if Congress had
intended to have anything more

00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:38.530
than that anywhere else in the
law that would be superfluous

00:18:38.530 --> 00:18:40.690
so a law should not
be interpreted

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:44.290
as being superfluous even
though if you thought of this

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:52.770
as a Venn diagram you would have
what VARA covers is like a pea

00:18:52.770 --> 00:18:59.100
in a watermelon so the ripple --

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.270
, to argue that the
fact that there are --

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.700
, that there's a tiny
shred of attribution rights

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:07.750
in VARA somehow that means

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:10.620
that there can't be
attribution rights anywhere else

00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:16.060
in any other law is I
think sort of pernicious

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:21.080
so that's another reason to
deplore the Dastar decision.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.430
All right, let's turn now

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.920
to copyright management
information.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:30.630
The locust for this is
another international treaty

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:33.980
but the WIPO copyright
treaties post-date TRIPS

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.620
so their norms are
not enforceable

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:42.230
through TRIPS our compliance
is a matter of goodwill,

00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:46.550
of course we totally
comply but there's no --

00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:51.580
, we can't be hit over the
head if we don't comply

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:57.380
and indeed one could argue that
we don't comply because the text

00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:03.040
of the WIPO Copyright Treaty
Article 12 and the equivalent

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:06.860
in the WPPT, well actually
never mind the WPPT,

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.460
just stick with Article 12,

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:13.330
the standard is this
double knowledge standard

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:19.850
which as we will see is
problematic but if one knows

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:24.770
that the removal or alteration
will enable facilitator, conceal

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:28.690
and infringement of any
right covered by this treaty

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:34.520
so the new rights in the
WCT or the Berne Convention.

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:37.970
The rights in the Berne
Convention include the right

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:42.370
of attribution so
under the WPPT removal

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:45.940
of copyright management
information that leads

00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:50.340
to a violation of the
attribution right is actionable

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.010
but if you look at our text --

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:57.100
, I'll just move ahead
for a moment, the standard

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.550
for our text is having
reasonable grounds to know

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:02.560
that it will induce,
enable, facilitate

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:06.960
or conceal an infringement
of any right under this title

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.490
but we don't have an attribution
right under this title apart

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:17.250
from tiny, tiny VARA so that
means that there is a disparity

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.440
between the scope
of the obligation

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:24.320
in the WIPO Copyright Treaty
and the way we have implemented

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:28.530
that obligation in
U.S. copyright law.

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:34.040
The mere fact of denying
attribution through removal

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.710
of copyright management
information does not suffice

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.160
to make out a violation
of our provision.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:45.730
So what does make out a
violation of our provision?

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:48.750
A few questions that the
courts have grappled with,

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:51.610
what is copyright
management information,

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:55.710
where must it appear and
the knowledge problem.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:22:01.060
There had been some dispute

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:08.410
about whether copyright
management information includes

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:11.050
-- , is only digital information

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:14.590
or is any identifying
information

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:17.250
as set out in the statute.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.480
I think the majority trend,

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:22.930
the overwhelming majority trend
today is that it's not limited

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:26.090
to digital information.

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:29.010
The text after all says
including in digital form,

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:34.630
well including implies that it
also covers not in digital form.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:41.250
What's helpful here is that the
statute lists among elements

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:44.820
of copyright management
information the name of

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.550
and other identifying
information

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:49.280
about the author of the work.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:55.570
However is that a
statutory author or is

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:56.940
that an actual creator?

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.640
We're back to that problem.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:03.870
We've narrowed the zone of
beneficiaries of some CMI claim

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:07.330
if it's limited to
statutory authors,

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:09.740
however I think there
is a means,

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:12.280
if the Copyright
Office were so willing,

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:17.790
to include more actual creators
not just statutory authors

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:23.350
because the statute in number
eight gives the Copyright Office

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:26.580
the power to prescribe
other information

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:30.860
so the Copyright Office
could say creators regardless

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:32.940
of work for hire status.

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:39.810
The problem is that copyright
management information is

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.190
not obligatory.

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:43.020
Copyright management
information is applied

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.180
by the copyright owner
who may not be the author

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:51.050
and therefore there may not be
a total alignment of interests

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:54.040
and I think the way the
statute is written which says --

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.160
lists a whole bunch of
elements and says any of these,

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:01.140
that to me implies that
there is no obligation,

00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:04.640
that you can't really read the
statute to say if you're going

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.170
to -- , you don't have to apply
copyright management information

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:11.070
but if you are going to imply
copyright management information

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:13.310
you must include
all eight of these.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:16.120
I don't think, much as I
would like, I don't think

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.970
that that's an appropriate
reading of the statute.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:27.750
Other questions that Section
1202 has given rise to which is

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:31.450
where is the copyright
management information?

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:35.850
Does it have to be embedded
in the copies themselves?

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:37.380
The statute doesn't say that.

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:40.900
Conveyed in connection
with is pretty broad and so

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:46.220
if for example as was mentioned
earlier the Creative Commons

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:49.280
licenses are explained

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:54.900
on the Creative Commons
website you could argue

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:59.480
that the combination of those
icons plus the explanation

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.990
together satisfies
the requirements

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:06.170
for copyright management
information.

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:10.560
Case law is divided on whether
just having a copyright notice

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.590
constitutes copyright
management information.

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:15.050
There's also questions

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:18.310
about where this
information should be placed.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:22.370
In some respects it harks
back to the bad old days

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:26.190
of mandatory formalities and
where you place the notice.

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:28.720
You might lose your copyright
if you placed the notice

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.520
in the wrong place for
some decisions seem to lead

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:36.940
to a conclusion that if
you don't place the notice

00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.360
in sufficient proximity
to the element

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.980
that you are claiming
copyright management information

00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:45.660
for then it's invalid.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:50.180
Now the hardest part
is the intense standard

00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:53.710
because as I mentioned it's
a double intent standard.

00:25:53.710 --> 00:26:00.740
Let's look at 1202(b)
although the reasonable grounds

00:26:00.740 --> 00:26:06.240
to know the last part qualifies
both 1202(a) and 1202(b)

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:11.430
so you intentionally remove,

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:14.020
so there's a knowledge
element there,

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:18.420
or you know that
somebody else has removed

00:26:18.420 --> 00:26:22.190
that copyright management
information

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:25.110
but that's not enough.

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:28.800
Then if the first knowledge
standard is met it is also

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:36.530
necessary to show that if you
distribute or publicly perform

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:40.390
and so forth the
altered or removed copies

00:26:40.390 --> 00:26:45.380
of the works you're doing
that knowing that not only

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:50.710
that the management information
has been removed but also

00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:54.790
that you have reasonable grounds
to know that that removal

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:57.960
or alteration will
induce, enable, facilitate

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.890
or conceal an infringement
of any right

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:03.190
and it can't conceal
an infringement

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.450
of an attribution right because
we don't have an attribution

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:10.310
right and that's where the
cases, many of the cases fail,

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:17.570
the attempts of authors
to invoke 1202 as a means

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:22.820
of protecting their-- ,
identifying them with the work

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.390
that it would have to be shown

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:28.030
that the distributor
not only knew

00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:30.960
that the information had
been removed or changed

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.120
but that the distributor had
reasonable grounds to know

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:39.730
that that removal would
facilitate the infringement

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:43.490
of other -- , violation
of rights, other rights,

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:45.700
other economic rights.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:47.510
Sometimes that can
be made out as

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.370
in the Agence France
Presse case against Morel

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:54.770
but there are a lot of cases
where it has not been possible

00:27:54.770 --> 00:28:00.120
to make the link between knowing
removal or knowledge of removal

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.800
and reasonable grounds to know

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:07.000
that that will facilitate
a downstream infringement

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.600
of an economic right.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:14.790
So that is a problem but I
have to say that we didn't make

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:16.200
up the double knowledge
standard.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.320
That comes from the
WIPO Copyright Treaty

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:24.400
but what doesn't come from the
WIPO Copyright Treaty is the

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.130
linking to the violation of
an economic right as opposed

00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:31.060
to the violation of
an attribution right

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:39.540
which is why I contend that as
enacted 1202(b) is of some help

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:44.140
but it could be better and
moreover it's not consistent

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:46.450
with the international text.

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:49.000
I don't know if Karyn wants
to say anything about that.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.340
All right, so let's turn to
the more positive aspects.

00:28:53.340 --> 00:29:19.520
What are the prospects for
moral rights in the U.S.?

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:00.380
And I've divided this
into without legislation

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.070
and then what if we
actually had a statute.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:05.390
So without legislation, I think
that one strong possibility is

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:07.870
that the inclusion of
attribution should be --

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:11.670
, can already and should be
taken into account as part

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:14.430
of the first fair use factor.

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:19.550
It's not necessary to rewrite
107 to add an additional factor

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:22.130
but as part of the
nature and the purpose

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:25.640
of the use attribution
could be taken account of.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.190
Now I have to acknowledge
that there is very,

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:30.500
very little case law on this.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:35.510
There may be two cases
that consider that failing

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:40.750
to attribute cuts against fair
use but fair use is dynamic

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:45.100
and perhaps some
courts, particularly

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.380
if they were sensitive

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:50.920
to my slam dunk international
obligation argument might

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:56.230
interpolate an attribution
element into the consideration

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:57.650
of the first fair use factor.

00:30:57.650 --> 00:31:02.740
I think there are things that
the Copyright Office could do

00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:08.030
to make Section 1202
more effective.

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:09.780
I mentioned including
authors regardless

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:13.460
of their work for hire status.

00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:17.630
I also think that the Copyright
Cffice could sponsor the

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:20.520
development of best practices
for identifying authors

00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:23.180
and perhaps the next panel
will talk more about that,

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:26.780
that as mentioned earlier many
common law countries include a

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:32.630
reasonableness condition
as part of fair dealing

00:31:32.630 --> 00:31:37.350
so what's reasonable could
be subject to development

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.840
through best practices or other

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:42.390
out of multiple stakeholder
forms of consultation.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:44.770
That's the way Australia
does it.

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:49.710
Australia's statute delegates
to best practices so I think

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:54.600
that as part of an accompaniment
to a fair use inclusion

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:57.270
of attribution as part

00:31:57.270 --> 00:32:02.950
of the first factor there
could be parallel development

00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:06.910
of reasonableness standards
and also development

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:12.750
as a practical matter of
how are you actually going

00:32:12.750 --> 00:32:15.250
to implement the information

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:18.000
about who is an author
to be credited.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.510
And then there's the
question of waivers.

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:23.130
Although I've said
very bad things

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:25.950
about VARA there is one respect

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:30.800
in which I think VARA is
pretty good and that's

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:36.880
on the waiver standard and I'll
return to that when we look

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.710
at what a statute might include

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:42.750
but I think the Copyright
Office could also develop the

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:43.650
waiver issue.

00:32:43.650 --> 00:32:48.970
There was a study that the
Congress directed the Copyright

00:32:48.970 --> 00:32:50.930
Office to prepare in
connection with VARA

00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:56.900
for how the waiver practice
was actually happening

00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.860
but the study concluded that
there was almost no information

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:04.340
out there at the time that that
study was undertaken but perhaps

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:06.970
that could be revisited.

00:33:06.970 --> 00:33:13.310
Okay, now let's call
this let's dream.

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:16.610
What if we had moral
rights legislation?

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:20.320
I think it has to answer
the following questions,

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.860
who are the beneficiaries,

00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:25.930
what violates the right
and the waiver issue.

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:30.470
So in my world a human
creator regardless

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:34.280
of employment status
should be the beneficiary

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.970
of an attribution right.

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:41.500
I think that the monkey in
Borneo does not have copyright

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:46.810
or attribution rights but
human creators as opposed

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:51.490
to [inaudible] authors should
have attribution rights.

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:55.940
That doesn't tell you who
is a creator who is entitled

00:33:55.940 --> 00:34:00.580
to attribution rights
but we do have case law.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.600
It's not always coherent
and it's subject to lots

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:07.680
of criticism but there has
been an attempt in the courts

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:15.190
to develop the concept of who is
an author usually in the context

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:19.640
of joint works because somebody
comes out of the woodwork

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:20.950
and says I'm an author
too and not all

00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:26.840
of that case law is laudable,
I'm thinking particularly

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:30.890
of [inaudible] but there is work
percolating from the courts.

00:34:30.890 --> 00:34:35.370
Perhaps we could continue
to develop the concept

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:39.010
of who is an author
and then import that to

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:41.230
who gets attribution rights.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:45.740
All right, scope, I think that
the duration should be the same

00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:49.190
as for economic rights.

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:55.180
I do not think that attribution
rights should be perpetual even

00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:59.600
though from a kind of consumer
protection point of view I think

00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.620
that there's a consumer interest

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:08.480
in accurate attribution whether
the work is in the public domain

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:13.050
or not but as a matter
of copyright law I think

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:15.840
that the right should
be coterminous

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.570
with the economic rights.

00:35:17.570 --> 00:35:19.420
The right would be infringed

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:20.930
by omitting the author's
name subject

00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:22.170
to reasonableness requirements

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:26.900
and as mentioned earlier I think
those reasonable requirements

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:30.790
could be developed
through a multi-stakeholder

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:32.640
consultative process.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.200
The last suggestion
I'm ambivalent about,

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:36.190
false attribution.

00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:38.770
I said earlier that I think

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.870
that false attribution is
actually not a moral rights

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:45.080
issue and that common
law countries have

00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.990
to some extent conflated
unfair competition issues

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:49.650
with moral rights.

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:52.020
The only reason I
would put it in his

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.720
because of the Dastar problem.

00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:58.960
Peter Yu mentioned that
there's the broad reading

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.900
and there's the narrow reading
under the broad reading.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:06.940
There may not be a 43(a)
claim for false attribution.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:09.880
Lower courts have by and large
been taking a broader reading.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.210
I think that while we're
dreaming the better approach

00:36:13.210 --> 00:36:16.260
would be what Justin Hughes
has suggested which is

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:21.220
to "fix the Dastar gap by
amending 43(a)" to deal

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:24.140
with false attribution and then
I would take false attribution

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:27.680
out of a copyright
attribution provision,

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:32.190
but if we can't fix the Dastar
problem then this is better

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:35.620
than nothing but I acknowledge

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:38.930
that analytically it's a
different set of concerns.

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:40.110
And then waiver.

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:43.420
I said that I thought
that VARA was not bad

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:48.730
on the waiver provision
except for the very last part.

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:50.500
The very last part of VARA says

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.760
that one author's rights
waives everybody's.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.600
That is very bad.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:37:00.000
So I have rewritten this in
red to provide that a waiver

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.020
of rights made by one author
binds only that author

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:04.340
so the other -- ,
the co-authors,

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:08.130
do not lose their
attribution rights

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:14.200
but in other words I think
that that text is pretty good

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:16.760
and in our imaginary
statute could go in as such.

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:18.140
Finally remedies.

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:23.440
Again from VARA, VARA does not
make registration a prerequisite

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:29.410
either to bringing a claim or
to damages, statutory damages

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:30.810
for a violation of VARA.

00:37:30.810 --> 00:37:34.330
I would import that into our
attribution right statute.

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:38.260
I think that the primary relief
would be injunctive relief.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:43.610
The author wants her name
associated with the work and by

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:47.270
and large this would be
prospective but to the extent

00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:49.480
that there might be
outstanding inventory

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:59.120
to the extent we still have hard
copies I think an appropriate

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.730
remedy would include
adding the author's name

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:06.700
to those already produced but
not yet distributed copies

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.080
and as for damages I think
it might be difficult

00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.250
to prove actual damages

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:15.800
but statutory damages might
be an appropriate component.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:21.380
How much those statutory damages
should be is another discussion

00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:26.200
but I would be I think
favorable to having some element

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:31.160
of statutory damages and
I think we have some time

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.600
for discussion.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:35.180
&gt;&gt; Yes, I want to start off
with just a quick question

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.830
about the Dastar case because
I think that's something

00:38:37.830 --> 00:38:41.140
that people have
mentioned as the linchpin

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.650
of U.S. compliance
in some sense.

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:43.820
What would your view be

00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:47.270
of whether the Dastar case
actually is a linchpin

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:50.060
so at the time that
we actually complied

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:53.350
with the Berne Convention
or said that we complied

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:57.090
with the Berne Convention Dastar
had not actually come down.

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:58.220
Would you agree that at

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:01.110
that time our moral rights
protections were strong

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:04.950
or would you believe that
they were actually still

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:05.730
somewhat weak?

00:39:05.730 --> 00:39:09.780
&gt;&gt; I think when we ratified the
Berne Convention it was possible

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.720
to make a barely plausible
argument that our patchwork

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:17.120
which importantly included
43(a) suffice and I will say

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:20.330
that Jack Kernochan and I wrote
an article taking the position

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:22.090
that the patchwork
could be sufficient.

00:39:22.090 --> 00:39:26.760
Now I will also point out that
we wrote that before the UK

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:31.560
and other common law countries
added explicit moral rights.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:35.510
One of the arguments was the
United States doesn't need

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:37.200
to have moral rights
in the copyright law.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:41.000
What counts is whether you
have a moral rights protecting

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.520
result, it doesn't matter what
the label is and I'm sympathetic

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.160
to that point of
view but a corollary

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.590
to that was just
look at the Brits.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:55.740
They don't have any kind
of explicit moral rights.

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:58.220
They barely have any moral
rights at all and they're

00:39:58.220 --> 00:39:59.420
in the Berne Convention

00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:03.290
so if they can do it surely
the United States can do it.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:05.400
That largely unspoken argument
then became somewhat less

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:06.840
persuasive when common law
countries did start enacting

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.430
explicit moral rights provisions
so that's another element

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:09.990
that perhaps has changed the
way one evaluates the question

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:12.310
between 1988 and
1989 and post Dastar.

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:13.720
&gt;&gt; And then just to follow

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.350
up on the post Dastar
points you had mentioned

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:19.310
that some district courts
are taking a broader reading

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:21.250
of the Dastar decision.

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:23.230
There is a debate in academics

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:26.300
as to whether you should
construe it broadly or narrowly.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.720
Can you kind of give a
little bit more detail

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.540
as to how lower courts are
interpreting Dastar and whether

00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:35.100
that affects how we
may use the Lanham Act

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:37.160
for compliance with
moral rights?

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:43.910
&gt;&gt; Okay well the first line of
defense which crumbled quickly

00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:49.390
and Peter Yu alluded to it is
that DayStar concerned a work

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:54.150
in the public domain and you may
recall Justice Scalia's colorful

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:56.920
language about a
mutant copyright law

00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:01.230
that the plaintiffs
here were end running,

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:04.920
the fact that they failed
to renew the copyright

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:09.570
in the motion picture and
they shouldn't be allowed

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:14.580
to get themselves a kind of
de facto extended copyright

00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.500
by bringing the Lanham
Act into service

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:24.500
so the narrowest reading
would be regardless

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:28.820
of what the court said on
its facts this was a case

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:33.000
about a work in the public
domain and it doesn't prejudge

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.440
or determine the assessment
of a false attribution

00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:44.750
or maybe even a non-attribution
claim with respect to a work

00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:47.390
that is still under copyright.

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:51.330
Now that didn't fly at all
and I think it's pretty clear

00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:52.550
that it didn't fly at all

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:56.280
because of what the
court said about origin.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:42:01.060
A false designation of origin
does not mean the intellectual

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:02.170
origin of the work.

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:04.380
The court was very
clear about that.

00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:08.970
It means that as Peter
said, I think it was Peter,

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:13.940
that it means the physical
origin, the producer,

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:19.760
distributor of the physical
goods, that's all that origin

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.450
in the Lanham Act means.

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:25.360
Well under that approach it
doesn't matter whether it's a

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.650
false designation of origin or
a non-designation of origin.

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:33.320
If origin doesn't mean
intellectual origin then

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:39.270
that kind of knocks the
Lanham Act out as a source

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:41.190
of attribution rights.

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:43.770
The broader reading still is

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:46.990
that some lower courts have
attributed rather broad

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:53.560
preemptive effect to Dastar
to conclude that you can't try

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:58.550
to work in attribution rights
or false attribution claims

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:03.350
under other theories
of law so that part,

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:07.360
the very broad interpretation
of Dastar means

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:10.140
that we don't have the
Lanham Act as a source

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.600
of attribution rights anymore

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:15.000
and we might not have some other
common law theories as a source

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.060
of attribution rights and
that wonderful patchwork

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:24.940
that was evoked in 1988 and
1989 is looking like maybe two

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:27.470
or three very ragged strips.

00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:31.260
&gt;&gt; And with that I want to turn
it over to the audience to see

00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:35.190
if we have any specific
questions to Professor Ginsburg

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:39.610
about how we might strengthen
moral rights of attribution

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:40.000
or whether we need to.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.420
&gt;&gt; What I didn't
hear in your talk

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:50.620
about legislation was why
we should have legislation

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:55.270
implementing a right
of attribution.

00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:59.110
Is it strictly because we agreed
to in the Berne Convention

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:03.620
or are there other reasons
affecting the public interest,

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:10.390
why the general public would
be benefited by adopting this?

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:16.590
&gt;&gt; I suppose the first answer is
we did assume an international

00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:24.730
obligation and in so doing
Congress supposedly took the

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:26.690
public interest into account.

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:29.630
When we ratified the Berne
Convention we thought

00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:34.030
that that was a good thing
for the United States

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:37.570
and the Berne Convention
doesn't allow reservations

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:40.700
so you can't say well the Berne
Convention is a good thing

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:45.350
except for Article 6bis or
for that matter Article 18

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:48.470
which we did not
initially implement either.

00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:53.830
That was the provision that
requires states when they join

00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:59.680
to restore the copyright
in works of foreign origin

00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:03.420
that are still in copyright
in their countries of origin

00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.790
than if they are
out of copyright

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:10.060
in the United States
they have to be --

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:11.530
, their copyrights
have to be restored

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:15.790
and of course there were a
certain number of works that fit

00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:19.060
that bill because they were
published without a notice

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:21.630
of copyright, they went
straight into the public domain

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:24.470
or their copyrights weren't
renewed and so they went

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:27.870
into the public domain after 28
years which is much too short

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:32.970
under the Berne minimum period
of protection or in some cases,

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:37.630
in fact the Golan case
itself concerned works

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:41.430
which one they were
published their country

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:44.570
of origin was a country
that was not a member

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:49.720
of a copyright treaty with
us but Article 18 says

00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:55.160
that when another country joins
the Berne Union then their works

00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:58.580
have to get protected, so we
had an international obligation

00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:02.460
enforceable through TRIPS
to restore the copyright

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:04.750
in Soviet works that had fallen

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:07.710
into the public domain
in the United States.

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:11.250
Now Congress made
the determination

00:46:11.250 --> 00:46:13.680
that passing the burden,

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:18.340
ratifying the Berne Convention
was a good thing not just

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:21.030
for authors but for
the public and also

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:28.490
for the American economy as
a whole because even back

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:34.580
in the 1980s the ways we used
to make money by making cars

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.680
and steel and electronics
we weren't doing

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.690
that so much anymore but
we were certainly creating

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:43.520
and exporting an awful lot
of intellectual content

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:49.190
and so we had an interest beyond
the perhaps parochial interest

00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:54.220
of authors in having very
good international protection

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:59.490
so I guess that would be my
first answer to the question

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:03.410
about whether attribution rights
are in the public interest,

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:05.590
I'd say at that highest level.

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:08.580
I would say also that
attribution rights are

00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:12.730
in the public interest in part
for what some might consider

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:15.340
to be consumer protection
interests

00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:19.970
that the public has an interest
in knowing who created this work

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:25.120
and that the author obviously
has an interest and that

00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:30.560
that interest is not
simply a vanity interest.

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:35.760
I think that the Constitution
conceives of copyright

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:42.090
as creating an environment
that will encourage creativity

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:47.190
and being recognized for your
creation I think is very much

00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:52.110
part of that environment
and so I would say

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:57.970
that public interest is one
that should be considered

00:47:57.970 --> 00:48:00.680
to be deeply rooted not only

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:05.930
in our economic interest
but in our polity.

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:07.760
&gt;&gt; Any other questions?

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:11.050
&gt;&gt; Hi, Carrie Devorah, Center
for Copyright Integrity.

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:12.820
I was very excited
when you were speaking.

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:16.480
I'm thinking oh awesome how is
it nobody has gone after Google

00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:19.120
for doing exactly the
violations you were talking

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.990
about should not be done?

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:23.730
I also wanted to raise a
point about David Slater,

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:24.870
the monkey photographer.

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:26.360
I've gotten to know him.

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:28.250
I would consider what David did

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:31.050
in what he's explained
to me as set design.

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:35.500
He worked for weeks with a
monkey to encourage the monkey

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:40.330
to become familiar so just
keep points on, a fact on point

00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:42.490
but Google, look
what they've done.

00:48:42.490 --> 00:48:45.890
They have walked away
with all of our works.

00:48:45.890 --> 00:48:48.080
I took a picture of
a picture I just did,

00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:50.440
sent it out to a
colleague of mine

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:52.920
but that picture has
now been taken from me.

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:56.270
I'm not dead yet, I'm
not life +70 so how is it

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:59.880
that Google has escaped the
liability of what you just

00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:03.590
so wonderfully described
a liability existing for?

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:08.120
&gt;&gt; I think that question we
go to economic rights as much

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.650
as to attribution rights.

00:49:10.650 --> 00:49:11.510
On -

00:49:11.510 --> 00:49:16.530
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:21.290
Let me -- , get back to that
on the monkey [laughter].

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:25.200
I think there have been -- ,
I didn't mean to be flippant.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:29.190
There have been a number
of variations of the story.

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:35.460
Some have given the monkey
more agency than others.

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:38.800
Under the maximal monkey
agency approach [laughter],

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:46.960
up there with the
Zika virus I think

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.290
that that does not qualify.

00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:55.690
However in the variations
on the story

00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:58.350
where the photographer
set the scene

00:49:58.350 --> 00:50:02.840
and all the monkey did was click
the shutter there are a lot

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:06.770
of cases actually not only in
the U.S. but in other countries

00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:09.000
where it's exactly
that scenario.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.360
The photographer has set the
scene and somebody comes along

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.020
and pushes the button and
courts generally consider,

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:15.930
that is the person

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:20.250
who structured the image not
the person who pushed the button

00:50:20.250 --> 00:50:24.180
who is the author of
the work but this gets

00:50:24.180 --> 00:50:27.380
to the question fairly
raised if we're going

00:50:27.380 --> 00:50:32.570
to have an attribution right we
had better know who is an author

00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:38.300
and in many instances that's
not going to be too difficult

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:40.350
to figure out and in lots

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:44.810
of instances there are indeed
conventions about giving credit

00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:47.940
if one thinks about the Writers
Guild agreements in such.

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:52.900
The fact that at the margins
it may be difficult to identify

00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:55.360
who is an author is
not for me a reason

00:50:55.360 --> 00:50:57.860
to deny attribution
rights altogether.

00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:01.060
On the contrary I think
we need to work on coming

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:08.590
up with a reasonable
and implementable notion

00:51:08.590 --> 00:51:12.970
of authorship and I do
think that digital media,

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:15.690
CMI is not limited to digital
media but digital media

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:18.880
in fact offer a lot
of opportunities

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:24.220
for robust author
identifying information.

00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:27.300
&gt;&gt; Any other questions?

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:32.120
&gt;&gt; I was going to circle back
to this in RMI but I'm curious

00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:38.730
when you were talking
about the AFP v. Morel case

00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:44.090
and in connection with
the CMI information there,

00:51:44.090 --> 00:51:47.180
do you favor a more
broad interpretation

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:49.040
or a more narrow one?

00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:54.200
&gt;&gt; I think that the claim could
be made out in the Morel case

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:58.340
because what Agence
France Presse did was

00:51:58.340 --> 00:52:03.040
to make the picture available
for other news entities

00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:07.050
to then reproduce
and communicate it

00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:10.640
so there you could show that
they had reasonable grounds

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:14.590
to know that there would be
a downstream infringement

00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:17.430
but the facts don't always work

00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:21.750
out with the downstream
infringement.

00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:26.720
You wouldn't have to worry
about that if the removal

00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:31.520
of the attribution were
itself an infringement

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:36.030
which is what the WIPO
copyright act says

00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:42.890
but then the question
becomes can you fix that gap

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:44.800
between the international norm

00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:46.820
and our implementation
of that norm.

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:50.680
Is it possible to fix
that without legislation

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:54.390
or would it be necessary
to somehow work

00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:59.670
in the words attribution
in order to close the gap?

00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:05.230
And I think it would be
nice if one could come

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:12.020
up with a creative way to close
the gap without legislation

00:53:12.020 --> 00:53:16.490
because I'm not so
sanguine about legislation

00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:21.420
but if we are going to have
legislation that's a clear

00:53:21.420 --> 00:53:25.930
candidate and I invite people
to be creative in thinking

00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:34.470
about how you can somehow
interpret section 1202

00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:41.450
to make it consistent with
our international obligations

00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:45.690
and of course there
there is no WTO action

00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:47.860
because the TRIPS
Accord doesn't apply

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:50.000
to the WIPO copyright
treaties which came later.

00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.770
&gt;&gt; I argued for AFP
in the Morel case

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:03.010
and my take is a little
different on the case.

00:54:03.010 --> 00:54:05.350
First of all it was fascinating

00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:08.100
but the jury had no
understanding at all

00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:12.350
about the DMCA and I
mean that was very clear.

00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:17.500
At the early part of it
there was no Morel name

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:19.110
on any of the artworks.

00:54:19.110 --> 00:54:23.200
By way of background he posted
these, initially it was thought

00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:24.820
that he was a citizen
journalist.

00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:27.230
Somebody stole them,
a guy named Suero

00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:30.870
so AFP initially takes
them off Suero's site

00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:33.620
and lists it giving
Suero credit.

00:54:33.620 --> 00:54:35.770
A few hours later they
find out it was Morel

00:54:35.770 --> 00:54:38.090
and they always gave
Morel credit.

00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:40.060
He was always in the tag.

00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:42.830
It said AFP Morel or AFP Getty,

00:54:42.830 --> 00:54:45.410
Morel as part of
the distribution.

00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:49.340
There was never any time
that his name was removed

00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:50.820
because his name
wasn't on anything.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:52.030
It wasn't on the website.

00:54:52.030 --> 00:54:56.330
It wasn't on his website either
so there was never any removal.

00:54:56.330 --> 00:55:00.350
There was never any distribution
by AFP or its subscribers

00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:03.210
or Getty without
attribution to Morel.

00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:05.750
What the jury seemed
to have found

00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:08.270
and again it was
convoluted because --

00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:10.170
, well we don't have
to get that into it,

00:55:10.170 --> 00:55:14.610
but it was that they
associated, it said AFP, Getty,

00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:18.520
Morel which is standard
media information

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:23.500
for a source distributor
and photographer

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:27.490
and since he wasn't
affiliated it seemed it was

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:32.360
that misassociation
that was the basis

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:39.460
of the very small DMCA award
which was kind of odd for us

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:43.400
because there was
never any distribution

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:46.440
and the court also
specifically did not --

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:47.760
, they ruled against
the argument

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:48.530
that they originally made

00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:49.670
because they originally
said this was going

00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:51.660
to be a $180 million
dollar case.

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:53.410
We could see the
DMCA going downstream

00:55:53.410 --> 00:55:55.190
and the court ruled not,

00:55:55.190 --> 00:55:58.200
that the downstream users
were not going to be counted

00:55:58.200 --> 00:56:01.780
as part of the DMCA damages.

00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:04.920
&gt;&gt; I think that your account

00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:10.020
of the facts illustrates why
it would be a really good idea

00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:15.350
to develop standards
or best practices

00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:20.050
that the Copyright
Office might endorse

00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:24.160
for what is copyright
management information.

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:29.910
&gt;&gt; I think we have time for one
last question if we have any.

00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:31.630
Well I think we're
just one minute out.

00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:34.820
I guess my last question is
do you have any predictions?

00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:37.070
You said you weren't
that sanguine

00:56:37.070 --> 00:56:41.370
about the possibility
of legislation.

00:56:41.370 --> 00:56:44.170
&gt;&gt; Well I think some of this
is in your hands [laughter]

00:56:44.170 --> 00:56:47.520
and so I want to be sanguine

00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:49.770
about what the Copyright
Office can do

00:56:49.770 --> 00:56:51.590
because I think actually
there's quite a lot

00:56:51.590 --> 00:56:58.260
that the Copyright Office
can do both enforcibly

00:56:58.260 --> 00:57:03.600
and certainly morally
and I'm quite serious --

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:06.260
, I think I said there
were two takeaways,

00:57:06.260 --> 00:57:09.870
one is that Article 10(3)

00:57:09.870 --> 00:57:16.120
of the Berne Convention
imposes an enforceable

00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:21.480
through the WTO obligation to
credit the author in the case

00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:26.650
of the quotation
right and that many,

00:57:26.650 --> 00:57:29.790
much of what we consider
fair use would fit

00:57:29.790 --> 00:57:31.870
within the quotation right.

00:57:31.870 --> 00:57:33.840
And therefore take
away number two

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:39.400
that court should start
developing as part of 107(1)

00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:47.130
to take into account the
attribution to the author

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:53.050
if it was reasonable to
attribute to the author

00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:56.510
and then the copyright office
can tell us what's reasonable

00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:59.500
when it comes to
author attribution.

00:57:59.500 --> 00:58:01.320
&gt;&gt; Well I want to take
this time once again

00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:04.510
to thank Professor Jane
Ginsburg for her talk.

00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:09.010
[ Applause ]

00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:12.720
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
