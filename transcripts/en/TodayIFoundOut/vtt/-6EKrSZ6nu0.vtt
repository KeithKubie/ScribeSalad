00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:25.030
“The Queen’s Guard” comprise of various
soldiers tasked with guarding the residences

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.280
of the Queen and, by extension, the Queen
herself.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.579
Consisting of soldiers (mostly) hand picked
from five elite regiments within the British

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.649
military, the Queen’s Guard are internationally
renowned for their stoic dedication to duty.

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.069
However, contrary to popular belief, these
soldiers are permitted to move (and do so

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:47.120
regularly, even when just on guard duty and
not on parade) and in certain circumstances

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.730
do react to hecklers or the like.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.999
That said, while on duty outside one of the
Queen’s residences, these sentries are trained

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:59.129
to remain unflinching in the face of everything
from extreme weather to screaming abuse a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.170
few inches from their faces.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.049
In fact, if they end up having to relieve
themselves during their two hour shifts (generally

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:09.390
two hours on, four hours off), they remain
just as outwardly unflappable, instructed

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.490
to simply perform their necessaries in their
thick woolen trousers which, according to

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.189
Guardsman Shaun Marsden, “are sufficiently
dark to cover their embarrassment”.

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:22.340
(While this might seem a short span of time
to ever have this occur, it should be noted

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.619
that on hot summer days, Guardsmen are instructed
to drink very large amounts of water before

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.380
going on duty to attempt to prevent heatstroke
and dehydration.)

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.770
But despite these bastions of British stoicism’s
reputations, they do move regularly- at least

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.960
every 10 minutes they will turn and patrol
their post, which usually involves taking

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.280
about 10-20 paces one way and then back before
once again resuming their vigil.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.630
Occasionally a guard may also perform such
a march to approach an individual within their

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.130
vicinity who is being a particular nuisance
or the like, but the more common purpose of

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.340
these little jaunts is usually just to get
the blood flowing again to keep it from pooling

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.840
too much in their legs, potentially causing
the soldier to faint.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.391
Speaking of fainting, if a soldier begins
to feel themselves succumbing to such, they

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:06.960
are taught to “faint to attention”.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.120
This basically means that they must faint
while maintaining their standing at attention

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.120
pose.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.000
In practice when achieved, this tends to result
in them falling rigidly over like a toy soldier,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.490
which is why pictures of guardsman laying
face down, rather than more or less crumpled,

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.990
on the ground abound on the web.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.510
Fellow Queen’s Guard members around said
individual are forbidden from deviating from

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.280
their duty if this occurs and will in fact
march straight over their fallen comrade if

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.280
necessary.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.240
(Medical personal will, of course, be sent
out to attend to the individual when this

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.240
is observed.)

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.380
While not a common occurrence, this does happen
every now and then.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.900
For instance, during the 2017 Trooping the
Colour, in which temperatures sat around 27°C

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.530
(80°F), five of the Queen’s Guard, baking
in their many layered, thick uniforms and

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.570
bearskin hats, passed out.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.950
Beyond fainting and marching, the guards also
may move about in a variety of other ways-

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.730
they are guards after all.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.670
However, given that their roll has largely
been reduced to a symbolic one, with local

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.350
law enforcement generally taking care of any
problems that arise around the Queen’s residences,

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.950
today one of these elite soldiers breaking
their normal stoic stance is generally simply

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.590
due to tourists, rather than a real threat
or need for them to perform as actual guards.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.230
That said, members of the Queen’s Guard
will rarely openly react to tourists taking

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.700
photos or telling them jokes to try and make
them laugh and are, in fact, specifically

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.980
instructed to ignore stuff like this.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.480
However, if a particular group of tourists
is being especially annoying, the guard may

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.200
make their best effort to ruin a picture or
the like, for instance by suddenly turning

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.400
and marching right when the tourists are all
posing for a photograph with the guard.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.540
In one instance we came across, a guardsman
noted he’d just continuing to march while

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.230
such tourists are around, passive aggressively
getting them back for their disrespect- somewhat

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.570
akin to the Seinfeld Soup Nazi, “No picture
for you!”

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.620
Speaking of marching, should you get in the
way of a member of the Queen’s Guard who

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.730
is doing this, you’ll likely find yourself
having said soldier shout something to the

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.780
effect of “Make way for the Queen’s Guard!”

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.510
Failure to move out of their way will result
in you being knocked over, as one hapless

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.570
man found out in 2015.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.590
(Although to be fair to said man, no one in
the Guard chose to yell “Make way!” until

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.440
after they ran into him, and he clearly was
oblivious to their presence before the collision,

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.459
so wasn’t trying to disrespect them.)

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.440
One guardsman also noted that, while exceptionally
rare, occasionally a tourist will tell a particularly

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.350
good joke which may elicit a smile or even
laughter from him, though if a soldier is

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.900
caught in such a slip in composure, they get
docked pay (a few days to a week’s worth

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.700
depending on the severity of infraction) and
may endure other punishments, including in

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.790
extreme cases being kicked off the guard.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.420
Thus, while trying to get the guard to lose
their composure may seem all fun and games

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.981
to tourists, if one is successful and the
guard’s superiors find out, that person

00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:52.430
may have just screwed with the livelihood
of said soldier, who in the first place aren’t

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.760
exactly getting rich as a member of the Guard.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.320
(They are generally paid somewhere between
about £1200-£2000 per month, which is about

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.930
$1,500-$2600.)

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.880
As for sanctioned interactions with people,
should the guard deem someone enough of a

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.660
nuisance (though not necessarily a real threat,
with in that case guards free to react however

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.740
they see fit to deal with the situation),
they are instructed to do the following:

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.180
Come to attention sharply, involving a very
loud stamp, which is all the more startling

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.260
when said soldier was otherwise motionless
before.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.210
Shouting sharp instructions at the individual
being a nuisance.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.590
This might be something like “Step back
from the Queen’s Guard!” with the guards

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.030
required to keep their warnings and ultimatums
brief and to the point.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.730
Marching towards the individual.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.450
Pointing the bayoneted rifle directly at the
person being a nuisance.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.360
If all else fails, doing whatever is necessary
to detain the person causing the disturbance

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.460
or pressing a button in the sentry box to
alert police to come deal with the situation.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.371
One potential almost surefire way of eliciting
such a strong reaction is to touch the guard

00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:56.080
or otherwise exhibit extremely disrespectful
behavior, such as marching along beside the

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.860
soldier in a mocking fashion while insulting
the guard verbally.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.971
And if you’re wondering whether said rifles
that may be pointed at your face in such a

00:06:02.971 --> 00:06:06.250
scenario are loaded are not, they are usually
not.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.580
(Though one imagines having a sharpened bayonet
wielded by a highly trained soldier shoved

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.690
in your face is intimidating enough, even
if you know the gun it’s attached to is

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:16.690
not loaded.)

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.590
Occasionally the Guard do carry ammunition
with them though, particularly when there’s

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.780
knowledge of a credible threat to the safety
of the Queen or nation or otherwise when a

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.740
heightened state of security is ordered.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.550
In these cases, if necessary, the soldier
can load the rifle in a blink by simply ejecting

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.100
the empty magazine and popping in a full one.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:38.000
And, yes, as actual guards- even if their
duties today are mostly ceremonial in practice-

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.571
said individuals are authorised to use deadly
force when appropriate, most notably if they

00:06:42.571 --> 00:06:47.160
feel their own lives, members of the royal
family, or the general public near their guard

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.500
post are endangered.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.860
As an idea of just what the Queen’s Guard
have long had to deal with from people, former

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:57.510
guardsman Ronald Tibbets notes, “Some march
up and down with us and others pull our bearskins.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.860
Some people put fag ends down the rifle butts.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.090
Some stick oranges on the end of the bayonet…”

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.610
It’s also noted that having banana peels
or other such items placed along a soldier’s

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.350
marching route is occasionally a thing.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:11.570
People also sometimes attempt to untie the
guard’s shoelaces.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.590
One member of the Guard even noted it wasn’t
uncommon for people to “stick pins in you”

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:17.240
to try to make guardsmen flinch.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:21.090
It’s not all bad, though, and guardsmen
have noted that some people are quite respectful

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.130
when approaching for photographs and the like.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.900
Further, one guardsman noted in an interview
there was a general “perk” of frequently

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:31.620
having women flash guards to get a reaction
and also sometimes having phone numbers and

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.800
addresses slipped into their pockets by those
women no doubt wanting to see whether the

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.000
ability to stand at attention for hours at
a time translates to the bedroom.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.060
Today, many problems the Queen’s Guard have
long had with the general public has been

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:45.430
mitigated somewhat.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:49.580
To get around the fact that the public seemingly
can’t be trusted to act respectfully around

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:54.780
said soldiers, the guards in many, but not
all, cases now stand behind fences or roped

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:55.840
off areas.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.990
They still have to deal with the heckling,
of course, but at least can now in many posts

00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:04.040
avoid being stuck with pins.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.790
Given the mostly ceremonial nature of the
posting these days, you might be wondering

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:11.120
what the guards actually think about while
standing for so long.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.340
One guardsman noted, “sometimes I just people
watch” (that, after all, being partially

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.970
what they are supposed to be doing- keeping
alert for any threats), but at other times,

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:23.280
“I tend to sing songs in my head or try
to remember as much of a movie from start

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.420
to finish in my head…

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.180
I’ve gotten pretty good at that.”

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.430
Before a parade, the iconic bear skin hats
of the Queen’s Guard are shampooed and conditioned

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:35.029
to make them look as glossy and full as possible.

00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:38.620
Individual soldiers are also expected to comb
their hats on a daily basis.

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:43.389
These bearskin hats are made from Canadian
brown bear and generally weigh around 1 kg,

00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:47.330
though get significantly heavier when it’s
raining.

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:52.199
The practice of the Guard wearing large bearskin
hats dates back to the early 19th century,

00:08:52.199 --> 00:08:56.279
with the hats’ purpose primarily meant to
intimidate by making the soldier wearing it

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:59.279
look much taller.

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:02.820
In some ways, the Queen’s Guard are comparable
to the soldiers who guard the Tomb of the

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.110
Unknowns in the US.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:08.709
Both are famed for their discipline and commitment
to duty and both can, contrary to popular

00:09:08.709 --> 00:09:13.110
opinion, deviate from the strict, regimented
routine should a member of the public act

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.291
in a disrespectful manner.

00:09:14.291 --> 00:09:15.291
For more about these soldiers you can read
our article about them here: Standing in a

00:09:15.291 --> 00:09:16.410
Hurricane- Watching Over the Tomb of the Unknowns.

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:20.029
Although the soldiers who serve in the Queen’s
Guard are invariably “a member from one

00:09:20.029 --> 00:09:24.649
of five regiments of the Foot Guard from the
British Army’s Household Division”, specifically

00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:28.470
the Grenadier Guards, the Coldstream Guards,
the Scots Guards, the Irish Guards and the

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.279
Welsh Guards, (meaning the Queen is being
protected by soldiers from the four countries

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:36.829
that make up the United Kingdom) they can,
in theory, hail from any regiment serving

00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:37.920
in the commonwealth.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.180
Because of this, the duties of the Queen’s
Guard have, on occasion, been assumed by everyone

00:09:42.180 --> 00:12:15.290
from the Royal Marines to the Canadian Expeditionary
Force over 

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:16.800
the years.
