00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.120
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic...

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.120
...I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.500
The best villains come from the most unlikely places, don't they?

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.600
Who would've thought such a seemingly kind, magical, and enchanting enterprise

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.600
could turn out so many diabolical geniuses?

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.380
Oh, they also made some good movie villains too.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.440
Still, Disney is known for having some of the best movie villains in cinematic history.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.200
Maleficent, Frolo, Gaston, Scar, Lady Tremaine,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.600
the list goes on.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.800
All of these baddies stay with us

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.600
as some of the most deliciously despicable

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.600
characters that we love to hate.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.600
They range in appearance and personality,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.600
yet they're always distinctly despicable,

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.600
which makes them distinctly enjoyable.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.600
These are villains that have, and will, be remembered for years.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.000
So um... What Happened?

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.360
Don't get me wrong, Disney villains in today's animated films are perfectly serviceable.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.900
They're mean, developed, and further the story.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.700
But is there anyone saying "Hey!  You know who the next Maleficent is?

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.700
That old guy from Up!

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.700
You know who gave me the chills as much as Frolo? Lots O Hugging Bear!"

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.700
These are not necessarily bad villains,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.700
but they're not ones who are really talked about much either.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.200
They do their job, but don't go beyond the call of duty.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.400
It's safe to say, they're not gonna be in that many villain lineups when Disney tries to sell their merchandise.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.400
That's also not to say that all the past Disney villains are perfection either.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.620
I doubt Edgar is gonna be on any top ten lists,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.100
Or the Horned Kings, Sykes and...

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.200
Asshole deer.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.760
But there's no doubt that people can name a lot more villains from the older days of Disney than the more recent days.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.480
Shere Khan, The Queen of Hearts,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.320
Cruella De Vil, Jafar.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.560
Whether for comedy, misery or both,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.660
they just have more personalities that stick with us.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.020
So...why is this happening?

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.100
Were there just more memorable bad guys in the old days

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.400
or is there a distinct difference between how Disney does villains now

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.040
compared to how they used to do them before?

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.600
The villains of nowadays just don't leave their mark as strongly as their predecessors.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.360
I guess we should clarify what qualifies as a that.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.320
Well, I guess it means being a villain that people love to watch.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.940
Whether humorous or scary

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.160
they're the characters you can see starring in their own movie.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.900
In fact, some of them even did.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.660
Not well, but they did.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.840
In my opinion, the last really great Disney villain

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.220
that people love to quote is Hades.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.520
He was energized, funny, menacing, and considered by many to be the best part of the movie.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.860
This was the last real scene-stealer.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.460
So, how come the majority that came after him don't stand out as much,

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.920
even though they do their jobs perfectly fine?

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.680
Well, first let's look at the numbers.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.720
There's just a lot more Disney films.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.760
Technology has stepped up, business has boomed

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.560
and Disney has pushed out a lot more flicks.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.460
Because of this, it's more likely that we overlook some films that had good antagonists.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.620
The Rescuers Down Under had George C. Scott voicing an evil poacher

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.700
and having the time of his life.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.540
But it got lost in the winter rush, thus few remember him or have even seen the movie.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.720
Treasure Planet had a pretty complex villain

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.860
one of the best known in literary history and portrayed pretty strong.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.160
But because hand-drawn films were on the way out,

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.920
few people saw this one too.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.100
On top of that, with more movies coming out

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.540
there's more of a rush to meet deadlines.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.720
Not that there isn't tons of time devoted to these villains and that it doesn't clearly show

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.040
but big-budget animated films used to produce a film roughly every three to four years.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.940
Now it's a minimum of one a year

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:29.520
meaning the time they had to develop villains was also expanded.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.520
But even when more films started to come out, there were still some pretty cool nemeses seeseeseesees...

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.560
Ursula, Jafar, Gaston and so forth.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.140
However as time went on, a new focus was starting to take center stage.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.280
You see, when animated films first came out

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.860
they were so mindblowing that you didn't always need the best story.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.820
Snow White is a simple fairytale with simple characters

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.640
and the story ran on a more emotional logic than...logical logic.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.980
Therefore, there was more focus on how to get feelings from the visuals rather than what they were saying

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.360
So the nasty imagery was very nasty

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.140
to make the pleasant imagery seem all the more rewarding.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.540
So, back then it more made sense to have the villains

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.360
and their surroundings to be more creative, design-focused and as terrifying as possible.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.800
Just look at Sleeping Beauty.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.040
Nobody really remembers the personalities of the prince and the princess

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.880
but they all remember the personality of the villain.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.560
Cinderella is nice enough to want to root for

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.740
but it's more out of the fear of how controlling and dominating her Stepmother is.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.660
That's what made the happily-ever-after seem all the more happy.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.460
Because it harnessed the emotion of fear.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.040
Bottom line, making the villains more interesting was not only more fun for the animators to draw

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.540
think about it, they're not usually allowed to depict this kind of imagery in something for kids,

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.280
but it also made the cheerful moments all the more cheerful.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.220
Going through your everyday life is fine

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.960
but if you survive a horrible threat, that same day can feel pretty amazing.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.280
This was the tactic that was cleverly used by Disney.

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.620
But the problem is, it did it too well.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.940
Some of the main characters were coming across as

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:01.920
too dull without enough traits to make them unique,

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.240
an element mocked later by Disney themselves in movies like Enchanted.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.780
So Disney had to focus on what you could argue they should have been focusing on the whole time:

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.360
the main characters.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.380
Princes went from having almost no lines to being charming, likable guys

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:21.000
and princesses went from elegant blandness to expressive and energized personalities.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.820
More time was being put to making them more relatable and updated.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.480
taking time away from making the villain more nasty.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.200
Mother Gothel and the Shadow Man are not bad villains

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.800
but more time is on our leads than them,

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.400
not allowing as much time to shine as there was in the past.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.980
But maybe that's for the best.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.360
The villains at least seemed on par with their heroes rather than upstaging them.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.440
They still got attention and we love to fear and jeer them

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.420
However, the classic fairytale good vs. evil was starting to be challenged by more modern audiences.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.120
If characters were going to be more three-dimensional and complex

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.320
the heroes needed more flaws and the villains needed more humanity.

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.460
Great character-writing often acknowledges people aren't just born good or bad

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.280
they're made by their surroundings, which are often addressed in good stories to understand them better.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.920
People were evolving beyond the basic good vs evil story.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.300
They wanted something more interesting, more challenging, more...human.

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.140
Thus began Disney's latest craze: The Unknown Villain.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.440
What do I mean by this?

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.760
I mean, I'm gonna go into spoilers for all of these movies

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.220
just to talk about their villains.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.620
You all remember when the Sixth Sense came out

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.000
and suddenly every movie needed to have a twist at the end?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.780
Well, not only did Disney catch onto that craze,

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.380
but it often made sense to use to get their massage across.

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:45.480
Movies like Zootopia, Frozen, Atlantis, Tarzan,

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:50.780
Treasure Planet, Wall-E, Wreck-It-Ralph, Up, Monsters Inc., Big Hero 6,

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.720
and Toy Story 2 and 3 all have surprise villains.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.520
They're people made to look like average characters

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.600
but are either halfway or even at the end revealed to be the bad guys.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.960
This takes time away from focusing on them being evil

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.360
and thus are not given enough time to usually be developed

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.520
at least...as they were in the past.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.740
Now, don't get me wrong,

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.420
this has been used before and very cleverly.

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.400
Two of my favorite villains are Gaston from Beauty and the Beast

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.060
and Sid from Toy Story.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.500
But both of villains work in a very organic way.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.540
Gaston is the same throughout the entire film.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.120
He's egotistical, funny, intimidating and wants nothing but Belle.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.480
By the end, he's exactly the same but

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:36.260
the circumstances have pushed him to fight harder for what he wants

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.900
and we as the audience members see him for the threat that he is.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.540
Sid in many respects is similar but works a little differently.

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.840
You know he's not a good kid, but you also know he's just a kid.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.600
Nothing he's doing is illegal or evil, he's just a trouble-maker being a trouble-maker.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.940
By the end, his motivation is still the same

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:57.860
but he's pushed it to a point where the toys fight back

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:00.500
forcing him to see more of his childish humanity.

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:04.340
Both of these characters seem well defined from beginning to end

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:07.800
despite a change of them going from annoying nuisance to main threat.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:12.240
This allows them to feel more distinct, memorable, and in many ways, relatable.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.240
We either know people like this or have been people like this.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.240
Compare these to two modern Disney villains:

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.220
Hans from Frozen and Pete from Toy Story 2.

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.820
They start off as seemingly well-defined characters

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:29.300
until the rug is pulled out from under us and we discover that they were villains the whole time.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.000
But the problem is because they do it as a twist

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
they become completely different people we have to be reintroduced to

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.720
making them less distinct, less memorable and less relatable.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.920
Gaston and Sid from beginning to end sound like the same character.

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.900
"It's not right for a woman to read.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.820
Soon she starts getting ideas and thinking..."

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.560
"One little word, Belle. That's all it takes."

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.780
Belle: "Never!"
-"Have it your way!"

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.900
"Well, we have ways of making you talk."

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.440
"And counting..."

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.500
"Ten...nine..."

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.220
Nostalgia Critic: Compare how these two sound from beginning to end

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:04.980
when their evil roots are revealed

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.340
"I was thinking the same thing, cause like

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.180
[Sings]
I've been searching my whole life to find my own place.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.000
"No, you're no match for Elsa.

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.980
I, on the other hand, am the hero--"

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.720
"Why, the prodigal son has returned."

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:23.920
"Fair!? I'll tell you what's not fair!

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:28.040
Nostalgia Critic: 
Their tone, mannerisms, and even personalities seem very different

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:31.020
meaning we can't get a handle on their character as well.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.760
These characters are done a lot with Disney films recently

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:39.480
which is not bad, often times they work out fine and help serve the story or message

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.500
but when it's done this many times and with this many villains

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.080
not only does it start to get old

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.200
but we're kind of losing that connection to...well...

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:49.860
enjoying our dark side.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:55.660
Nobody finds Hans, Bellwether, AUTO, or
Henry J. Waternoose cool villains

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.400
we don't enjoy watching them be evil, we just see them

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.080
as nuisances that get in the way of our hero.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.000
Now, they're good at being in the way and being roadblocks

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.120
but they're not charming, fun or charismatic like these villains are.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:12.720
And that's because they weren't allowed to be villains throughout the majority of the film

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.580
so you can't enjoy them as much in that role.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.780
We don't get to see the devilish smirk of Frollo,

00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.920
the gratifying laugh of Jafar,

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:24.560
the evil just enjoying being evil of 
Night on Bald Mountain

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.540
that's what makes these villains so much fun.

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:31.880
But the fact remains these are stories that aren't supposed to belong to the villains

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.420
they're supposed to belong to heroes.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.640
While the villains have to take a step backwards,

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.860
though, granted, a small step to be sure,

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:43.220
The heroes in Disney films are much more interesting and engaging than ever.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:49.420
Truthfully, these are the people we're supposed to learn from, supposed to look up to, supposed to want to be.

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.820
Their message and characteristics are 
much more interesting and complex

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.680
than that of dozens of older Disney films.

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.840
While these older movies are still classics,

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.080
and using both simplicity 
and complexity in the right places

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.300
Disney knows they need to evolve.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.360
People change, rules change,

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.880
and people find different ways 
of getting those rules across.

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:11.160
One of the more interesting recent developments is that

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.320
Disney doesn't always need villains.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:17.860
Sometimes it can just be a series of circumstances and conflicts that have to be overcome

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.600
And they don't always tie into 
just one individual causing it.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.100
The older villains used to be 
about battling the grand evil

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.320
and that not matter how threatening the danger

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.300
undying hope and strength can result in beating it.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.000
Modern day stories focus on 
a different kind of struggle.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:36.580
Struggles about identity, belonging,

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:39.860
seeing that things are not always as 
black and white as they seem.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.180
These are relevant issues and messages 
to get across today

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:47.360
and their antagonists have to reflect 
that in a way that best fits the story.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.120
It's not meaning to tone down the fun of the villains,

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.900
it's just it's seen as what's needed at the moment.

00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.400
So, are Disney's animated villains 
as great as they used to be?

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.040
No.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.560
But there's a good and even admirable reason why.

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.140
The same way Disney is trying to distance themselves from all their characters being too similar,

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:08.560
the same can be said for changes 
that are needed for their villains.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.880
The important lessons and creative ways 
they're trying to get across those lessons

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.960
don't always call for villains like in the old days.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.520
Would it be nice if some did?

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.320
Yes! And I hope they look into that
if for any other reason just variety.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.760
But Disney is on a hot streak because 
they know how to relate to people

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:28.340
and they know how to challenge and evolve.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.420
Disney wants to be relevant and it wants to be helpful

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.940
and it will do so in the way that each time period needs.

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.000
While the evilest of the evil seem old school now

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.540
maybe they'll come back in the near future.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:45.660
Because we always live in changing times and
people's focus and dilemmas change with those times.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.860
Disney is always going to do it's best to 
follow the dreams and problems of people

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.900
and reflect them cinematically for all ages.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.820
So, who knows what the future holds?

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.600
Maybe villains will get better, 
maybe heroes will get better,

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.000
maybe they'll both get better.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.960
Whatever happens, we still have a long line of 
badies who we'll look back on and smile

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.080
on how they always did their best to give us their worst.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:14.240
I'm the Nostalgia Critic.
I remember it, so you don't have to.
