00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
If you imagine quite far back you started off [with] midi files.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.860
[It] was one of the ways of transmitting music initially over the internet, then you added things called mod files,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.949
these were midi files with a very small amount of audio -- normally 8-bit audio added to it.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.579
You're talking about 1980s video games [of] the territory so [it] was slightly better sounding the Midi was but

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.150
considerably worse than audio was, and then

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.689
compression techniques started to come in, with sort of a ten-to-one, twenty-to-one compression rates and you could get a

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.890
mono audio track down to something you could easily download off the internet.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.440
So, we're talking about digital audio,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.750
fascinating topic,

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.040
I think you've done a piece on it before, just to recap taking in a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.420
analog Audio Stream

00:00:53.480 --> 00:01:00.180
and then sampling it both that way over time and in that way over amplitude -- slightly less relevant today,

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.540
but obviously when the internet first got it going you didn't have much speed so he wanted to have these files very much reduced.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.849
You know so take an audio file

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.869
that was quite massive, squeezed it down so you can pull over a small connection that led onto the field of audio compression being studied

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.710
One of the studies was our understanding of how we hear,

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.579
so clearly we don't want to encode information [that] is irrelevant to the way we hear.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.050
[It] requires us to understand the human ear, so let's have a look at that.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.800
So if you imagine in your ear itself this one will be pretty apt you've got

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.610
a bunch of little bones, and then you've got what's called a "basilar membrane" so a piece

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.020
of

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.020
skin that's rolled up,

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.070
very much like that, and then alongside of it, you've got these little hairs

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.399
They're called "cilia" and what happens is all the sound comes in different bits, if you imagine this basilar membrane

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.369
unrolled vibrate at different points -- if it's a low frequency it vibrates at one end, if it's a high

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.849
frequency it vibrates to the other -- that with the little nerves

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.259
hairs underneath they make a little nerve firing up the brain which enables you to perceive pitch in another higher level sort of

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.870
concepts of sound.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.820
Because of that rather limited nature of hearing, what happens is if -- if there's a loud sound

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:27.389
in a certain area, because [it is a] physical membrane this bit vibrates, but makes us desensitized to other

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.150
frequencies around it yeah

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.170
and that -- that's the basis by which we get to do some aspects of compression that particular bit is called the

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.760
psychoacoustic effects which is how we perceive sound

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.960
(Off camera:) Is it like the louder sounds kind of, like, obscure the lower sounds

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.440
and then we kind of hide the different frequencies?

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.220
The loud sounds obscure the less loud sounds around a certain frequency,

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.120
because of that physical membrane representation of the frequencies.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.709
And then there's been huge amounts of studies to understand how much it affects it to what degree.

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.920
What you do is then you take your digital audio

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.500
and you can imagine doing this yourself if you were -- and if you have a done an audio multitrack

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.790
system, you know sort of --

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.269
all of them,  there's Cubase -- whatever

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.769
pro tools --

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:25.499
take your audio track which would be a constant audio stream -- you can imagine filtering out into all its frequency bands let's say from

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.140
20 Hertz to

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.319
100 Hertz, 100 Hertz [to] 500 Hertz and so on and so on and then you can imagine

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.549
sampling them at different rates, so this one might be 8-bit, this one might be 16-bit, this one might be 24-bit

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:47.869
and you know by sampling things at different rates you effectively add a bit of noise to it, but you reduce the overall amount of

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.599
bits you need to represent it.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.960
(Off camera:) So you lower the quality but obviously you're lowering the file size.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:01.160
Yes but you're lowering the quality in such a way that because of the other sounds are going on you -- you can't perceive it,

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.049
and if you plotted that out, this would be called a psychoacoustic mask,

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.250
and that means you can reduce the amount of bits you need to describe something.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.299
But,

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:14.299
you can make very small,

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:20.329
perceptible differences to the overall sound, and that -- that's one of the core tenants, so it's sort of using the -- the rather

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.389
oddities of the way our hearing system has evolved -- which is, you know, far from perfect obviously --

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.769
to take advantage of that and then reduce the amount of data, and then you can do your normal sort of

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:40.999
compression tricks which work for any type of data stream, like, I keep seeing this string of digits come up,

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.000
so I'm going to put those up in a lookup table and encode it more efficiently than just encoding those bits each time.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.760
No different than, say, morse code does by saying we use certain letters more than you do others,

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.419
so I'm going to attribute a short key length to those and there's actually a whole

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.200
technique around that, called "Huffman trees" for anybody who wants to look that up --

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.450
fascinating things -- so you get, you know all of the other aspects information coding come into play,

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.139
but that sort of psychoacoustic bit is the bit that's very audio centric

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.410
So it's a bit that has quite a lot of relevancy.

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:17.719
So then there's other tricks, like if you've got stereo channels for comparing them in some way or

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.789
taking information out that way, but that's the sort of basic tenants of compression now that

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.820
absolutely, then opened up the internet music.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.979
(Off camera:) Since compression is still working the same way now, if you -- somebody is, you know, listening to spotify and

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.020
streaming audio is it there, or are there any other tricks they use...

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.679
Well there are lots more tricks...

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.909
For me, sort of compare this to any sort of innovation, so -- so it's slightly obscure

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.670
but if you take the -- something like the steam engine revolution, there was major innovations, and then people filled in all the gaps.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.189
In steam engine it was the notion that there was a steam engine, you drive a piston off and then you can

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.689
pump water out of mine, and then people put wheels on it and turned it into a train and all the other sorts of things,

00:05:58.689 --> 00:06:01.140
but the -- the fundamentals of it stay the same

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:05.920
(hesitation)

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.859
People have then done significant innovations inside of that,

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.740
but the notion, there is an understanding of how you hear, that clearly gets better over time so that bit [has]

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.050
improved, then there's a notion of

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:24.219
all of the encoding tricks you can go do on information sources, so this is like encoding it as better

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:32.619
Huffman trees, or whatever the modern equivalents thereof, so you get those pieces, but I think the fundamental tenants stayed the same,

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:40.719
just the overall increases have got better -- interesting also obviously bandwidth constraint to come down,

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:45.400
so the pressure has come off it a little bit as well in terms of an overall need.
