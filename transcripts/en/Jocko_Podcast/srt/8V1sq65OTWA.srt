1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,810
What is the difference between
an excuse and a reason? Hmm.

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,490
Kind of a good question, right? Sure.

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,970
Okay. And the reason it's a
good question because there's,

4
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:18,930
there can be legitimate reasons
why things happen. Yeah. Right.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,670
And so for instance, you're in a,

6
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,950
in a sailing race,
right?

7
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:29,820
In a sailboat and the mast snaps in half.

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,820
Now you don't win the race. Yeah.
But I mean you didn't, you know,

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,200
the mass snapped.
What can you do about that?

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:40,330
Or the weather's horrible
weather rolls in.

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,450
You can't launch your aircraft
so you can't go on your mission.

12
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,980
Well you can't control the weather. So
you know like what's up, how could that,

13
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:51,270
that's a reason. Or you get really sick
so you can't compete in a competition.

14
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,450
That's a reason you know you were sick.

15
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,890
Oh you do bad because you were sick and
yet there's a reason could be called

16
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:03,390
now. Now you could look
at the situation and say,

17
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:05,730
okay,
if I'm going to take ownership of this,

18
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,590
did I properly test the mast? Sure. Did I,

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,383
let me ask you this.

20
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,660
Did we have a ground based plan for the
operation in case the weather came in,

21
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:22,620
we were going to take vehicles instead.
Hmm. Right. Yeah. That would work.

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,060
If you get sick before the competition,
maybe you ask yourself,

23
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,220
were you resting properly?

24
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:33,000
Where you eating properly going into the
competition so you wouldn't get sick.

25
00:01:34,930 --> 00:01:37,140
You could address that.
Correct.

26
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,370
So you can still take ownership of things.

27
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:44,580
Even if the initial reaction is like,
oh there's, you can't control that.

28
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,380
Well then you can influence it.
You can mitigate it right now.

29
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,960
Can there still be legitimate
reasons? Yes, there can. And for me,

30
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,910
the difference,

31
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,240
the line between an excuse and a reason
is a reason you have zero control over,

32
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,900
right? You have zero. You just have
zero control over something happening.

33
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:10,734
Well that's a reason.

34
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:16,790
Did I tell you I was almost late
the other day for something? Uh,

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,970
cause this is borderline.
This is borderline.

36
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,800
I had an appointment at 10 o'clock.

37
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,410
I left is a 20 minute drive.
I left

38
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,880
an hour. I left at all.
I left about nine 10.

39
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:35,790
I left 50 minutes to drive 20 minutes.

40
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:38,750
Just so gonna make it on time. Yeah. Yeah.

41
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,520
I get on the road basically a couple of
roads out of my house and the one entry

42
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,210
way to get on the freeway is locked down.

43
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,690
Locked down,
like incident,

44
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:56,310
like isolate some incident incident on a
guy trying to kill himself on a bridge.

45
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,940
Shut the road down. Yeah. So no one's
going on the highway. So what is it?

46
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:05,620
Everyone's being channelized into
marginal, what are they called?

47
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,850
Back side streets rerouted.

48
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,100
The clock is ticking and,

49
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:17,470
and I made it right. I made
it. I was four minutes.

50
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:20,890
I had four minutes to spare. So instead
of it taking 20 minutes, it took whatever,

51
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:23,500
46 minutes,
took more than twice as long

52
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,990
that that could be,
you know,

53
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,130
fairly legitimate reason.

54
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,710
Now Luckily I had, I always, you know,

55
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,480
I had planned that there could
be something out of my control.

56
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,940
It might take even longer and that's why
I leave early to go to an appointment

57
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,590
or a situation like that.

58
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:51,030
So I could have also checked the
traffic prior to leaving and taking a

59
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:56,020
completely different route. That
would have been, I blame myself.

60
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,900
So even in that situation I'm kind of,
I was thinking the whole time, what?

61
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:01,570
Why did, why didn't I check
the traffic before I left?

62
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:04,270
I knew this could have happened.
So anyways,

63
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:09,640
in my opinion and excuses when you
blame something that you could have

64
00:04:09,641 --> 00:04:14,470
controlled in a reason is something
that you have absolutely no control over

65
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,330
whatsoever. You think like a legit
disease. I mean sometimes people have,

66
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,920
they just don't, you can't control
that. It happens. But I think,

67
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,450
and I think this is the important part,
I think that what you will find,

68
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,510
especially when you approach the world
with an attitude of extreme ownership and

69
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:35,530
that's that you're not
going to make any excuses,

70
00:04:35,531 --> 00:04:36,370
you're not going to name him routes,

71
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,640
is that you actually have a lot more
control over things then you think you do.

72
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:49,030
We've talked about this before.
When I go to the airport,

73
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:53,830
I get there really early because it's
something that you have no control over.

74
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:57,250
You're going to stand in that TSA line
and those people are going to take

75
00:04:57,251 --> 00:05:00,430
forever and that's the way it is.
And if you want to get mad at them,

76
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,410
it doesn't matter. You can't, you can't
control, you cannot control it in any way.

77
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,860
You can stand at the back of my flight's
leaving in 30 minutes and they'll be

78
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:11,620
like, whatever. You should have showed
up earlier. You can't control it.

79
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:14,290
So in those situations, how do
you control it? You show up early,

80
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:17,590
you take ownership of it, you
show up early. You don't just, Oh,

81
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:20,230
I don't know what happened. The
traffic was bad. I mean it's,

82
00:05:20,231 --> 00:05:21,640
there's a million excuses you can give.

83
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,380
If you get that attitude where
you're not going to make excuses,

84
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,070
you'll actually take ownership of the
things and then you'll actually solve

85
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:31,300
problems before they even happen.

86
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,650
If I'm going to an appointment and I have
the excuse of my back of my head that,

87
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:37,660
you know what, if I'm late, I'll
just say it was the traffic.

88
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,620
I have much more increased
chance of being late.

89
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,880
All right, so what's what, that's,

90
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,290
that's one of the things
that makes extreme ownership
hard is it hurts your ego.

91
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,390
It hurts your ego.

92
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:57,350
It hurts your ego to admit that you have
control over things that went wrong.

93
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:57,980
That's

94
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,350
that there.
It's your fault that hurts your ego.

95
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,540
It's also effective because of that.
It's effective because you solve problems.

96
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:08,630
Like I said before, they even happen. You
solve them because you take ownership.

97
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,620
Your man.

98
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:14,780
Isn't this just a bunch
of semantics though,

99
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:19,100
like excuses and reasons re cause
really when it comes down to it,

100
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,660
excuse is like an excuse.
Like you're excused.

101
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,610
Like the reason is a reason for sure.

102
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,580
But it's like well that's
what this whole conversation,

103
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:31,130
yes it is about semantics
and the semantics are for me.

104
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,430
And excuse is something that you could
have controlled and a reason is something

105
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:38,330
that you could not control. Aren't
they all reasons. So it's up to,

106
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:42,380
I mean again look, you say
tomato, I say to I get it,

107
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:47,350
but come on. Hey you brought it up so
you get, okay. So I remember when I,

108
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,920
when I was in elementary school,
you get, you come late to school,

109
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:56,480
you get in trouble unless
you have an excuse.

110
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,790
Now with it's, there's a
difference between, and I'm
saying in the, in the field,

111
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:06,620
in, in class, right? You come,
you come into class if you
have just your own excuse,

112
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:11,120
like oh my, you know, dog ate it or
know that's for homework, but whatever.

113
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:15,560
That's different than if
you have an excuse slip,

114
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,140
which is an official slip,
you know,

115
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:21,080
your parents or your whatever you
into the office and all this stuff.

116
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:25,920
Your movement to get excuse, slips,
change to reason slips. Cause that's what,

117
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,000
it's still legitimate reason. Exactly.
Kid had chicken pox can't come to school.

118
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,630
Yeah. So you can't come. Yeah, there's
nothing. You got chicken pox. That's what,

119
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,690
that's what, that's how, yeah.

120
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,860
That's how so but now given that now
aren't we just talking about a very split,

121
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:43,610
like a standard from case to case. So
like let's go back to La to school. Bret,

122
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,790
bear with me. You want to get to the
bottom of this. I'm telling you if you,

123
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,560
if you're paired by the thread by thread,
if your parents had car trouble, right?

124
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,770
Yeah.
Is that an excuse for a

125
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:58,850
nine year old for a nine
year old? Yeah, it is.

126
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:03,350
It is a reason for a nine year old that
falls on the hierarchy of standards,

127
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:08,351
but within the standards of being
a quote unquote legitimate excuse.

128
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:13,620
Right. Cause that's really what it
is. So a reason in your case, I mean,

129
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,310
you're a reason,
is language a legitimate excuse?

130
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,910
That's a reason as far as this
question goes. Absolutely. In fact,

131
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:24,200
I think I use the word
legitimate and yeah, in this
one, let's talk about it. Yeah.

132
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:28,400
Yeah. And so using the word reasons
rather than excuse is just like, okay,

133
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:32,480
let's make the language more simple rather
than, because if you have an excuse,

134
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:37,640
if you have an excuse that's an by its
very nature, by its very definition,

135
00:08:37,641 --> 00:08:41,360
you're excused. It's an excuse.
You're excused from for me,

136
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:45,110
late or being linked to your
blog, whatever. But if it's,

137
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,360
it's weird because if someone else
gives it to you, gives you the EC,

138
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,730
like you're excused, Da, hey, the guy was
about to commit suicide. I get it, man.

139
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,550
You're excused kind of thing.
It's like that's an excuse in this case,

140
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:59,220
a legitimate one,
but if you give it to yourself,

141
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,720
that's the excuse that nobody
likes. Right. Like, hey man,

142
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:08,580
traffic, all you should have prepared
for that. Hey Man, my, you know,

143
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,390
whatever was going on and this and that.
Aw Man, you got to prepare for that.

144
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,060
See what I'm saying? Yeah. I guess
they're off of, there you go.

145
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:21,210
So reasons and legitimate excuses.
Same thing. Yeah. I'll give you that.

146
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,640
You could have said that
like four minutes going.

147
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:27,750
I'm just saying you got to explain these
things because sometimes the hard to

148
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,710
understand. I'm telling you no.
See, the more you talked about it,

149
00:09:31,711 --> 00:09:36,040
the less I understand. [inaudible] said
the last thing I had to sum it up. Okay.

150
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,930
What I'm saying, the summary was great.
I'll give you a a B plus on the summary.

151
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,880
All right, pat, thanks.
I'll take it. Thank you.
