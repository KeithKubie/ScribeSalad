00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.030
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.620
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.
What's going on?

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.220
How I uh,
I am,
uh,
once again,

4
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:14.400
this is like all of a sudden I never have fucking guests and then all of a

5
00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:18.810
sudden they all come out of the woodwork almost at the same time on all

6
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.800
musicians.
And once again,
we have a very special guest.

7
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.950
Ms Tal Wilkenfeld how are you?
I'm good.
You got a new album coming out.
Yup.
Right.

8
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.033
It just can't,
you know,

9
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.420
I didn't even want to start with that because I know you've fucking been talking

10
00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:36.690
about all kinds of music I had asked you,
cause we over your place right now.

11
00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:38.220
Well,
how are you liking the Vitamix?

12
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.240
I love the Vitamix because I got into like the,
I'm an old man now.

13
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.290
I don't know if he can tell.
I use a lot of lotion,
right?

14
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.200
They can still in my twenties,
but I'm about to turn 51 here in June.
And uh,
I,

15
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.090
I've started to do like for breakfast.
I like to just have like a smoothie.
Yeah.

16
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.250
His phone.
He's,
that sounds to everybody doesn't live in,

17
00:00:56.251 --> 00:01:00.360
it's the fucking greatest thing ever,
right?
You just drink it.
You full.
Yeah.

18
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.630
You know,
rather than doing the Denny's grand slam breakfast,

19
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:06.450
you feel like a tub of shit,
which makes you eat something else bad.

20
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.200
So people been telling me about the [inaudible] mix and this is where I am in my

21
00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:12.720
life right now.
I'm like,
like that was the thing.

22
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.790
You have all these amazing instruments and shit.

23
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:16.890
And the thing that stuck out was like,
Ooh,
if Vitamix,

24
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.940
I wonder if that one mashes up the fucking spinach and Kale a little bit better.

25
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.320
The best recipe to you do cause I got it.

26
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.690
I got two really good ones that I stand by.
What are they,
are they trade?
Uh,

27
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.830
I got one that uh,
I substitute the Kale for spinach.
Spinach tastes better.

28
00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:35.160
All of this.
This is just,
it's a substitute for Dandelion Greens.

29
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.060
Just Fyi you with,
I use the landline Greens now.

30
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:41.130
What do you do to sweeten that up so it's not bitter as shit?

31
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.610
I used some honey just a little bit.
Just a little bit.
Yeah.

32
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.190
My one time my wife took me to some restaurant.

33
00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:50.580
We ended up eating like Dan the lines like a downline.
We both try not like,

34
00:01:50.581 --> 00:01:53.610
hey man,
let's be healthy.
We both looked at each other.
It's like,
oh,

35
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.270
it was one of the worst things I ever tasted.
So when you grind that up,

36
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.340
what do you have almond milk in there too?
Or Center?

37
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.080
It's actually a juice really.
It's not like a smoothie.
Um,
but it's quite thick,

38
00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:07.380
which is why I still call it a smoothie,
but mine has Dandelion Greens,

39
00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:11.520
Salon trow,
a little bit of black pepper.
Oh my God.

40
00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.870
Tumeric.
Um,
ginger like fresh ginger,
which,
which you call me.

41
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.970
What you stand by that it's this sounds,
it sounds honey.

42
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.160
What else do I put it in their water?

43
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.060
There's obviously water and then I get hungry an hour and a half later.

44
00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:28.310
Where do you buy Danny?

45
00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.830
Go in your backyard and yanked them out of the fucking grass.
What do you,

46
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:34.830
what do you get your dental lint?
Any health food store?

47
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.510
Wholefoods or I've never said,
I gotta be honest with you.

48
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.140
And I've been to a few of those little health food places.
I've never,

49
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.890
I've never seen that.
But,
uh,
all right.
Mine.
Mine is just simple.

50
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:45.150
It's just the almond,

51
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.580
it's a almond milk with some almonds just in case there's not enough almond in

52
00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:53.640
there that some spinach,
uh,
to fuck is a banana.

53
00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.570
A little bit of ice.
Um,
I know I'm forgetting something.

54
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.850
So cinnamon or blueberries,
do you ever use blueberries?
No.

55
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:03.730
I gotta get a couple of goals because I basically have to go to smoothies and

56
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:04.481
I'm getting sick of them.

57
00:03:04.481 --> 00:03:07.720
And then I have like this Greek yogurt parfait and I just sort of rotate that on

58
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:10.390
a three then I'm just,
I've had it,
you know,
you know,

59
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.460
like when you've been jamming with people too long,
you're like,

60
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:13.750
we need some new blood or something.

61
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:16.450
That's where I am with assuming me trying to steer it back to the music here.

62
00:03:16.451 --> 00:03:19.600
So let's at least say the name of your incredible album that I only heard three

63
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:22.450
tracks of,
cause I couldn't figure out how to download it.
Um,

64
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:24.910
for those of you not familiar with Tal,
she's,
uh,

65
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.540
she's basically played with everybody and I promised her I wasn't going to bring

66
00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:32.770
up all the past like,
hey man,
what was it like playing with this person?

67
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:33.604
But she's,
you know,

68
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.130
I MDB or she's played with literally everybody and you've basically been known

69
00:03:39.131 --> 00:03:43.510
as this monster Bass player that can just play with anybody.
And,
uh,

70
00:03:43.511 --> 00:03:47.830
your hidden talent of an unbelievable singing voice is finally displayed.

71
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:49.830
That that's what killed me when I listened to you.

72
00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.590
Just played those three tracks for me,
aside from a course,
how up front,
you know,

73
00:03:53.591 --> 00:03:57.220
the basis and all the mics,
which I'm loving.
Um,
I,
yeah,

74
00:03:57.221 --> 00:03:58.510
I had no idea you could sing like that.

75
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.870
<v 1>I kind of,
um,
I,
I've kept it quiet for awhile.</v>

76
00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.160
Like I started as a singer songwriter when I first picked up guitar and then,

77
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.390
um,

78
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.800
sort of started focusing just on guitar when I moved to America because I left

79
00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:15.880
home when I was 16 and I moved to America and I went to this music school for a

80
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:18.640
little while and,
uh,
I went from like

81
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.780
<v 0>help you went to a nice place,</v>

82
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.870
all this crap about the Michael Jackson documentary,

83
00:04:23.871 --> 00:04:27.230
which I refuse to fucking watch.
Why would you do that?

84
00:04:27.231 --> 00:04:30.680
Why would you put all those that those horrible stories in your head?
It's like,

85
00:04:30.681 --> 00:04:33.560
I get it.
All right.
The guy was a creep,
but now he's dead.
So

86
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:38.780
what are we doing?
I guess you got to list somebody going,

87
00:04:38.781 --> 00:04:42.610
someone was telling me going,
you,
how will you have to watch it?
So then you,

88
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:44.120
you as a parent,
it's like,

89
00:04:44.121 --> 00:04:49.121
I'm not gonna let some fucking guys sleep with my kid behind nine doors anyways,

90
00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:53.890
so you've got this album coming out.
So I went to,
um,

91
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.060
<v 1>I went to this,</v>

92
00:04:56.061 --> 00:05:01.061
this school and I went from being allowed to play like half an hour a day to

93
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.500
wanting to practice for like six hours a day.

94
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.480
<v 0>Was that torture for you,
considering the way you took?
I remember hearing,
yeah,</v>

95
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.530
I watched that interview.
You said the first time you actually played a chord,

96
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.450
you got emotional,
you cried.
Yeah.

97
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.200
So you love something that much and then all of a sudden you go into,

98
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.210
you're going to school in Australia.
Yeah.

99
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.700
So they would teach you about Columbus and all the great stuff that happened

100
00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:24.450
here in America of course.
Right.
Um,
whatever it was,
how you guys,

101
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.460
you got dropped off by the English and that what happened?

102
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.550
Something like that where a bunch of convicts apparently.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah,

103
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.170
exactly.
So then all of a sudden,
was that torture for you in school?
It was just,

104
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.250
yeah,

105
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.750
<v 1>it was hard because,
um,
you know,
academia was the focus,</v>

106
00:05:38.751 --> 00:05:43.460
especially like,
um,
where I like with who I grew up with.
Yeah.
Um,

107
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.180
my mom just like really wanted me to,
uh,
you know,

108
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.360
[inaudible] yeah,
I do all my schoolwork and stuff.
I mean,

109
00:05:50.361 --> 00:05:52.430
she's probably just being a responsible parent,

110
00:05:52.431 --> 00:05:57.170
but like I just was not into geography and history.
I was

111
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.890
<v 0>so,
did you ever just like to pick up the bass and be like,
mom,
listen to this.</v>

112
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.870
I mean,
I went to this and then look at my grades in math and you tell me which

113
00:06:06.871 --> 00:06:08.160
direction I'm supposed to go in.

114
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.390
<v 1>I mean,
uh,
I was just,
I was a guitarist at that point.</v>

115
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:13.400
Like I only switched to bass when I was 17,
which,

116
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.570
and I already moved to America at that point.
But yeah,
I mean,
she heard me play.

117
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:21.110
I just,
I think that like,
you know,
uh,

118
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.150
the music business is a tough place and she probably just thought like,
oh,
maybe,

119
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.030
maybe that's not the best thing for you to do,
to be in the music industry.

120
00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.360
It's so uncertain.
Um,
so,

121
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:34.910
but I wasn't going to listen to what anyone was going to say.
Like,

122
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.290
that's all I knew that I had to be a musician and I didn't care if I was going

123
00:06:39.291 --> 00:06:41.600
to be homeless and right and be a musician.
I just,

124
00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.610
I knew that that's what I had to do.
So

125
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.300
<v 0>have you ever wonder how many this,
how many musicians are out there?</v>

126
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.190
Because that story is like,

127
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:52.760
you had that inner drive and like I always wondered like,

128
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:57.470
how many like Jimi Hendrix or like working at home depot because their parents

129
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.130
or,
or some something,
you know,
they just didn't have that thing to be like,
no,
no,

130
00:07:01.131 --> 00:07:03.790
no,
fuck that.
I'm doing it.
Right.
Um,

131
00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:08.390
when really important people that basically taught you how to walk and talk and

132
00:07:08.391 --> 00:07:12.230
all of that stuff,
start telling you,
you know,
you shouldn't go in that direction.

133
00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.500
Is,
that's just something that you,
is,
was that something that developed?

134
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.280
Was it the love that you had when you started playing guitar that you will like,

135
00:07:19.281 --> 00:07:22.880
no,
I literally have to do this?
Or do you feel you always had sort of that,
that,

136
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.390
uh,
that drive?
Yeah.

137
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:28.920
<v 1>Well,
I actually think,
um,
as a kid,</v>

138
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.120
especially as a teenager,
like if your parents tell you not to do something,

139
00:07:33.121 --> 00:07:37.200
you're going to want to do it more like 99% of teenagers I dread those days.

140
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:41.320
Oh my God.
Okay.
Yeah.
So it probably worked,
uh,
uh,

141
00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:46.020
out in the right way that she didn't really want me to focus on music because

142
00:07:46.021 --> 00:07:50.520
that just made me want to do it more.
Oh,
okay.
Yeah.
I mean,
I'm kind of,
I mean,

143
00:07:50.521 --> 00:07:52.860
I wouldn't even say I was necessarily rebellious,

144
00:07:52.861 --> 00:07:56.250
but if you want something in that bad and someone's telling you no,
you're like,

145
00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.720
well,
I'll prove to you that I really deserve this and I'm gonna work my ass off.

146
00:08:00.721 --> 00:08:02.820
And I did,
like,
I was so focused,

147
00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:08.090
like my rebellion as a teenager was to succeed as a musician.

148
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.970
It wasn't like to go off and do drugs or whatever else.

149
00:08:11.971 --> 00:08:13.510
Like that was my rebellion was

150
00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.870
<v 0>who is success.
You know,
I went to,</v>

151
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.610
I was looking at schools to see which one to take,
you know,
put my daughter in,

152
00:08:20.611 --> 00:08:22.230
you know,
all the public schools and shit out here.

153
00:08:22.231 --> 00:08:25.200
I guess so you got to send them to private school and spend like a zillion

154
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.720
dollars by the time in like eight.
It's so fucking stupid.

155
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.930
So he went to this one and it was like a French speaking one,
right?

156
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:36.240
So all the kids was amazing.
The kids were super smart as a great score and,
and,

157
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:40.650
but the lady given like the tour,
right?
She goes,
uh,
the hell did she say?

158
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.870
I asked her,
I said,
hey,
you know,
uh,

159
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.470
did the parents kind of learned French along the way?
She's like,
no,
we,

160
00:08:46.471 --> 00:08:51.230
we encourage you to speak the perfect English at home and blah,
blah.
I said,
well,

161
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.610
what if I bought,
if I want to learn it too?
And she looked at me,
she goes,
yes,

162
00:08:53.611 --> 00:08:57.210
it's too late.
I was just like,
God damn,

163
00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.760
I actually respected it,
but you know what?

164
00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:03.610
I'm so happy she said that to me because now I've got this thing.
Like,
all right,

165
00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.930
I'll show you.
Yeah.
And I got flashcards.

166
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.560
I would have flash cards and I'm like looking at,

167
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.490
and I'm trying to put together phrases and stuff.
I listened the back of my head,

168
00:09:11.491 --> 00:09:16.491
I know she's probably right and I loved the school and I'm actually excited that

169
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:21.600
the potential to go there.
But like I do relate to that as far as,
um,

170
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:23.070
when somebody says that,

171
00:09:23.071 --> 00:09:25.110
but there was a period in my life where I wasn't that guy.

172
00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.610
Like if somebody said that to me,
I'd be like,
okay,
forget it.
Oh really?
So yeah,

173
00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:33.420
I've probably had that since I was really young.
Like,

174
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.980
like just determination to do whatever I want to do.

175
00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:40.520
Cause like I remember being super focused on,
um,

176
00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.910
running before I was a guitar player and I was like obsessed with long distance

177
00:09:44.911 --> 00:09:48.330
running.
Like,
and,
and in my head I'm like,
I have to be the best.

178
00:09:48.331 --> 00:09:50.550
I have to be the best runner,
gold from Australia.

179
00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.990
One girl that was better than me and it pissed me off so much.

180
00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:58.940
And I remember like,
there was this one race that was,
I dunno,

181
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.370
it was like a 10 mile race.
It was really long and,
and I just,

182
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.390
I just had to beat this,
go.
And I did beat the girl.
You did.

183
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:08.130
But I did this like,
um,

184
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.210
like still liberatory dance afterwards because I was so excited and I threw my

185
00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:15.720
back out and um,
yeah.
So then I,

186
00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:20.310
I kind of was like hobbling around for a little while and couldn't run a couple

187
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:23.850
of weeks and then that's actually when I walked past that guitar and started

188
00:10:23.851 --> 00:10:28.530
playing,
get this out.
Right.
Yeah.
Wow.
She get mad when you did that dance.

189
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:33.120
I mean,
I don't think she saw it.
She was that far behind me.
Wow.

190
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.710
That's like a feel good movie.
Except they,

191
00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.830
they always run credits before you blow out your back.

192
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.040
Then you became like a musician.
So,
you know,
the,

193
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.630
the few tracks that I heard in the three,

194
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.880
the three that I listened to is definitely,
you know,

195
00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.020
this is really like a very personal album as far as like,
you know,

196
00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.940
talking about yourself to that one you just played.

197
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:54.300
What was the name of the haunted heart?
I wanted love haunted love.

198
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.480
The one that's just the base and voice with the orchestra.
Yeah.

199
00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:59.710
That was some pretty,
uh,

200
00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.700
heavy lyrics that made me start thinking about my parents.

201
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:05.610
I went on a little trip there.
One of those.
Yeah.
Yeah.

202
00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.030
Thinking about my whole life and um,
I fo people listening here,

203
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:13.650
I can't recommend like the level of quality of,
of the music that you've,

204
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.660
you've done with other people now to actually hear,

205
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.350
hey these are my ideas with your voice on top of it.
Uh,

206
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.690
the second I heard you a few of these,
I was like,
oh this is one of these,

207
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:25.020
these albums I'm just going to put in back in the day when he had a CD.

208
00:11:25.021 --> 00:11:29.730
Just stick it in there until the thing just uh,
started skipping on you.
But um,

209
00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.920
you mean how your iTunes that skipping on you right now?
He like,

210
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.410
I know I am the worst.
I'm the worst before all you can download it.

211
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.040
You got Spotify.
It's like I don't have Spotify.
I,
I'm,

212
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:44.800
I'm this idiot who I still buy music and then it fills up your computer and now,

213
00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:49.240
cause right now I need a new,
I need a new laptop.
I need a new phone and an Ipod,

214
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.740
iPad,
the whole thing,
shit in the bed on me at the same time.
And uh,
yeah,
I miss,

215
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:57.950
can I buy it on vinyl?
I,
yeah,
I have a record player.
Yes.

216
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.280
I'll even give it to you on vine.
They don't need to do that.

217
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:03.150
You already got me a Burrito here from coming over,
so I'll,
I'll,
I'll,

218
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:07.150
I'll throw some money towards that,
but um,
wasn't gonna say.

219
00:12:07.151 --> 00:12:09.550
So you also mentioned that you're actually going to be doing a whole tour in

220
00:12:09.551 --> 00:12:13.240
this thing too,
Huh?
Yeah.
Now headlining tour.
You open and what are you doing?

221
00:12:13.241 --> 00:12:17.230
Headlining headline in.
Nice.
I'm excited.
And I got to Boston.

222
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:19.330
Is this your first like big headlining tour?

223
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.870
Cause you've always been like the hired gun.
Um,
as far as I know,

224
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:26.830
this is your first like,
um,
well I,
I actually,

225
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.920
I was opening for the who with my band and we played the Boston Garden and some

226
00:12:33.911 --> 00:12:35.770
really cool,
is it called the bus and garden?

227
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:41.050
They called the TD bank north garden keyed.
How'd you like that?
That was fun.

228
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:43.400
Then you do that recently?
Uh,
yeah,

229
00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:47.800
I did some stand up there and I did jam before with my brothers.
So cool.

230
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:52.570
Uh,
we had a good,
yeah,
we definitely heard a
[inaudible] ever.

231
00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:54.940
No one was paying attention at all and we were playing or whatever.

232
00:12:54.941 --> 00:12:58.070
They thought it was kind of funny that we were doing it.
And this is comedian,

233
00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:01.630
not Jim brewer who does this amazing pit on slayer fans,

234
00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:05.050
like how dedicated and crazy they are or we actually play it.

235
00:13:05.051 --> 00:13:05.930
I forget what song we played.

236
00:13:05.931 --> 00:13:09.250
We played a slayer song and literally it was like no one was reacting to

237
00:13:09.251 --> 00:13:12.670
anything we were doing.
We sucked right.
The second we started playing slayer,

238
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.790
some fucking security guide like you know,

239
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.900
halfway up the renewed just goes slayer.

240
00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:21.760
It was hilarious.
So,
um,

241
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:24.880
now your style of music like going,
no,

242
00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:26.410
you're going to ask me something that was going to say like,

243
00:13:26.411 --> 00:13:30.910
like what does playing before a standup set do for you?

244
00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.240
It makes the,
the venue not as intimidating.

245
00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:37.900
I've only done it at like what?
Because you know,

246
00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:42.520
it stand up in a place that big doesn't make sense.
You like highlight,
you know,

247
00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:46.810
I,
I had all these feelings of like,
why am I a,

248
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:49.750
like how did I get here?
What am I doing here?

249
00:13:49.751 --> 00:13:53.080
What the fuck do I have to say that justifies all these people showing up,

250
00:13:53.081 --> 00:13:57.730
you know,
the normal,
if you're any sort of like human being,
that's what you have.

251
00:13:57.731 --> 00:14:00.260
If you're a psychopath,
you just like,
yeah,

252
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:02.620
how come I'm not playing the football stadium or whatever,
you know,

253
00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:06.660
I've ever playing the Roman Colosseum.
But I,
yeah,
I was sitting there and uh,

254
00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:09.310
that's that what was,
what was going through my head.
But,
um,

255
00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.370
the first time I ever did one I did for the New York comedy festival and I did

256
00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:14.590
Madison Square Garden and,
uh,

257
00:14:14.591 --> 00:14:18.400
we got together and jammed in there and I just did that because I love led

258
00:14:18.401 --> 00:14:20.330
Zeppelin and they did song remains the same.
I,

259
00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:23.710
if I could just play some drums there and make a little bit of noise.

260
00:14:23.711 --> 00:14:27.760
And what happened was we were having so much fun and I invited so many people

261
00:14:27.761 --> 00:14:32.080
down there,
they,
I,
you know,
I didn't ever fully forget where I was,

262
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.520
but next thing you know,
you know,
I was yelling,
Hey Josh,

263
00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.510
John is at that Motley crew thing and you just,

264
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.300
you just yelling and you just kind of made it yours.
Yeah.

265
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:43.980
So that night it just didn't,
it didn't feel,
um,

266
00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.060
I was able to kind of just like,

267
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:50.260
I had already made a bunch of noise in there and nothing bad happened.
You know,

268
00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:51.620
we didn't enough the roof collapse.

269
00:14:51.621 --> 00:14:54.740
So I think that that's kind of like what it did for me.

270
00:14:54.741 --> 00:14:57.440
Although I fucked up at the form cause I played it like three hours.

271
00:14:57.441 --> 00:14:59.120
I almost fucked up cause I was just like,

272
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.020
I got off stage and I was like wiped out.
I was just like,
oh no.
Oh No.

273
00:15:03.021 --> 00:15:04.700
But then like the adrenaline is like,
oh my God,

274
00:15:04.701 --> 00:15:06.800
what if I bombing from all these fucking people?
You know,

275
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.420
that that'll get you through a good 90 [inaudible].

276
00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.690
<v 1>But why do you not like play on stage for your audience?
Because I respect them.</v>

277
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:17.130
Ah,
you're a great drummer.
I didn't know why you say that.

278
00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.240
<v 0>Uh,
I'm good for a comedian.
I'll give you that.
But I am not a,
you know what I,</v>

279
00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.480
I like,
uh,

280
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:28.400
like one of my favorite things to do is to watch a pro play cause it's just,

281
00:15:28.401 --> 00:15:30.350
you know,
when they're just doing like a sound check,

282
00:15:30.351 --> 00:15:33.440
a lot of times there'll be physically playing something that I could play,

283
00:15:33.441 --> 00:15:36.970
but I could never make it sound like that.
And there's always like a personnel,

284
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:38.150
you know,
if you listen to a really good drama,

285
00:15:38.151 --> 00:15:42.470
you can hear like you can hear them in the plane,
which,
um,

286
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.700
you know,
took me a while to be able to hear that.
But,
uh,
now I'm able to do,

287
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:50.840
and I've,
I've,
I've seen,
I don't know,
there's just something cool about it.

288
00:15:50.841 --> 00:15:55.010
It's like watching a professional hockey player,
like taping up the stick.

289
00:15:55.011 --> 00:15:58.790
There's just something,
when you see a pro doing something,

290
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:04.820
um,
it's,
and your into it,
especially if it's your hobby,
it's fucking mesmerizing.

291
00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:08.990
So that's,
that's why when a few times I've come over here,

292
00:16:08.991 --> 00:16:12.590
like I'm always in there cause I'm like sitting back and just watching all of

293
00:16:12.591 --> 00:16:15.410
you guys play.
And um,

294
00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:20.600
my favorite thing about watching a live band is watching a band that doesn't

295
00:16:20.601 --> 00:16:22.800
play it the same way every night and you,

296
00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:25.580
and even if you've never seen the band you can tell cause they like looking at

297
00:16:25.581 --> 00:16:28.280
each other and everything.
So that's when I get into like,
Oh man,

298
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.390
they're in the moment right now.

299
00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:32.810
This is like watching a comic riff and somebody's going to do something to make

300
00:16:32.811 --> 00:16:34.910
somebody smile and then he adds something else tonight.

301
00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:39.500
And just as an audience member and a fan of music trying to pick up like that

302
00:16:39.501 --> 00:16:42.830
thing going on and um,
and like my,
I in turn,

303
00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:45.200
like I'm the bands I listened to growing up.

304
00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:48.740
Like I remember Stevie Ray Vaughan whenever he was playing a solo,

305
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.130
it was like Chris Layton and Tommy Shannon and Reese will always looking right

306
00:16:52.131 --> 00:16:55.220
at him.
Like,
is he going to go back in again?
All we go and we going back to the,

307
00:16:55.221 --> 00:16:58.340
you know,
him singing and he just would fucking be wailing.

308
00:16:58.341 --> 00:16:59.900
And he had this little thing.
You just look at him,

309
00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:03.220
he gives him a little nod and how they all were like,
okay.
And,
and,

310
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:05.330
and they wouldn't fuck that up.

311
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.780
I'm just having attempted to Gino get together with friends and play and

312
00:17:08.781 --> 00:17:13.640
everything.
I just,
I've,
I have such an admiration for it.
So,
um,

313
00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:17.300
<v 1>I mean that's how I feel about comedy in great comedy.</v>

314
00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:19.400
And that's why I like watching you perform.
Oh yeah.

315
00:17:19.401 --> 00:17:23.000
When I do a great shit joke and I not over to somebody who just did a dick joke

316
00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:27.950
and it's amazing.
It's right on the same level.
No,

317
00:17:27.951 --> 00:17:29.990
but like,
cause I just started as,
you know,

318
00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:33.860
like getting really heavily into comedy to pass like a year or so.
Yeah.

319
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:38.540
And like the reason it appeals to me so much is because it like speaks to both

320
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.560
parts of me as a musician.
There's the,
uh,

321
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:46.670
the jazz musician in me,
which is like the improvisational musician,
which like,

322
00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:51.670
like really enjoys watching you ref like,
and,
and just,
and then there's like,

323
00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:56.700
then there's like the composer,
like the person that's like,
you know,

324
00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:01.720
into writing songs and like,
and then watching you create this amazing materials.

325
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.850
So it's,
it's very satisfying a requirement for people in your band.
Cause I mean,

326
00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:09.080
when you work,
when you go and do this tour,
like,
uh,
I,

327
00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.210
I just know doing the same jokes over and over and over again.

328
00:18:12.211 --> 00:18:16.740
It's like you have to like,
do something to break out of it.
Do you,
um,

329
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.910
on this tour,
I mean,
you sell on the album,
you got to go out and,
and,
and,

330
00:18:20.911 --> 00:18:25.740
you know,
play it and sell the music to them.
Like how,
how much,

331
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.270
like messing around do you do?

332
00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:32.670
I do a lot and then is a requirement and that's why it's been really tricky to

333
00:18:32.671 --> 00:18:37.440
find band members.
And I have found like the perfect,
um,

334
00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:41.250
guitarist and a drummer to play with me because,
you know,

335
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.660
my music is a composition.
Lee.
Um,

336
00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:47.010
like lyrically for instance,

337
00:18:47.011 --> 00:18:51.180
very influenced by folk music or just songwriter music.

338
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.390
But then musically it's,
um,

339
00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:59.560
it's influenced from anything from rock to folk to jazz to whatever.

340
00:19:00.121 --> 00:19:03.080
It just goes all over the place.
That's what I was loving.
But this,

341
00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:05.100
there's some sort of through line.
Maybe it's you,

342
00:19:05.101 --> 00:19:08.460
I don't know what it is on because I was just listening to that song was so

343
00:19:08.461 --> 00:19:11.550
great and then I really started listening to the mix of it.
I'm like,
wow,

344
00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:14.820
she's the whole bottom end of this song.
And then it felt like,

345
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:15.960
I don't know how to say technically,

346
00:19:15.961 --> 00:19:19.140
but it felt like the guitars and keys were like up here and,

347
00:19:19.141 --> 00:19:22.500
but you were the sort of the meat and potatoes of the whole thing driving the

348
00:19:22.501 --> 00:19:26.160
whole song,
but like the,
uh,
the different tones and stuff.
Um,

349
00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.540
there was why I'm,
I'm,
I'm the worst.
I don't know the names of the,
the one,
yeah.

350
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.750
When you went into that bridge that was [inaudible] is that with sections called

351
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.520
at Middlesex was just like,
what the fuck is that?

352
00:19:35.521 --> 00:19:38.700
And then you go right back to that part that really rocks.
When I looked at you,

353
00:19:38.701 --> 00:19:40.390
I was just like,
that's when the crowd's going to go nuts.

354
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.770
Cause you take them on this ride where you coming out and you just,
you know,

355
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:47.010
blowing their wig back in the beginning and then it goes to this other places

356
00:19:47.011 --> 00:19:49.710
like,
Whoa,
what the fuck is this?
This is this mood thing.

357
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:52.860
Well that's where it's like,
hey,
people start taking the drugs in the crowd.

358
00:19:52.861 --> 00:19:57.420
I would feel,
and
look,
and I went,
I went to what you'll be doing.

359
00:19:57.780 --> 00:20:00.690
That's what I do.
I grew up going to heavy metal cards.
That was a time,

360
00:20:00.691 --> 00:20:04.460
all of a sudden somebody like sparked up a fucking J is we used to say and uh,

361
00:20:04.461 --> 00:20:06.270
and then all of a sudden like out of nowhere,

362
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.260
you just punch him in the face again and then the fucking song is over.

363
00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.290
It's just like,
yeah.
Um,
I think that the cohesiveness,
um,

364
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.440
on the record comes from like having the same band play all of these songs,

365
00:20:18.691 --> 00:20:22.970
even though they've,
they're very different.
Like,
some are,
you know,

366
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:28.100
just vocal and base and some of our acoustic guitar and,
and very,
uh,

367
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.670
little,
uh,
behind me.

368
00:20:29.671 --> 00:20:33.360
And then there's like these full rockers but it's the same band and I just think

369
00:20:33.361 --> 00:20:34.740
that that's really important.

370
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:37.920
Like for how long does it take you to put that together?
Well,

371
00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:43.010
it took me a few years to sort of search for the sound of the record and like

372
00:20:43.591 --> 00:20:48.310
figure out who was going to play on it and who,
who like what was the,

373
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.460
the best sound for these songs.

374
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:56.820
And then I finally went into the studio with the Blake mills and Jeremy and

375
00:20:57.110 --> 00:21:00.130
polls Stacy and uh,
we cut corner painter,

376
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.650
which is the first song I played you in as the first song on the record.

377
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:07.630
And that when I heard that back on the speakers,
and this was no base,

378
00:21:07.631 --> 00:21:10.150
it was just,
I was playing acoustic baritone guitar.

379
00:21:10.151 --> 00:21:14.560
Blake was playing guitar and Jeremy was playing drums and the sound was so full,

380
00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:18.610
I didn't even want to play bass on it.
There's no bass on that song at all.

381
00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.620
I just played it on an organ.
And then Ben Montench overdubbed a organ as well,

382
00:21:23.621 --> 00:21:24.460
like a pump organ.

383
00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:27.790
But I heard that song was like this is the lynch pin for the record.

384
00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.330
And so then I went home and I like wrote a bunch of other songs that I felt

385
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.300
would fit with that vibe or compliment it.

386
00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:38.560
And then once I'd done that,
we went back in the studio for,

387
00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:42.580
it was like anywhere from like eight to 10 days and cut the whole thing at once.

388
00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:46.150
And so I think that that's part of the cohesiveness is that we just,

389
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.380
we cut it all together.

390
00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.230
<v 0>All right.
When you've put together a band,
have you ever had been like,
okay,</v>

391
00:21:50.231 --> 00:21:55.231
I know these two people are right and then a third person comes in and so takes

392
00:21:55.271 --> 00:21:56.350
it into another direction.

393
00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.050
You got to fire one of those other two people that just cause,

394
00:21:59.051 --> 00:22:00.880
but the other kids,
the other person's such a beast.

395
00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:05.920
<v 1>I mean it's all,
it's all about Canada pointed at the drums when I said that.</v>

396
00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:10.820
Right now it's all about chemistry.
It's like casting for a movie too.
Like,

397
00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:14.020
sometimes it's the most important thing is the casting.
All right.

398
00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:17.930
How do you like your lay by the way?
I Miss Australia.
Um,

399
00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:22.100
I don't Miss Australia.
Um,
some of my best friends are there.

400
00:22:22.101 --> 00:22:25.430
I definitely miss them,
you know,
but,
and I miss the beach.

401
00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:28.310
I didn't really think that the beach in La is that cool?

402
00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:32.200
<v 0>No,
I gotta be,
I'm terrified of the ocean and,
but every time I go to Australia,</v>

403
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:36.790
it's like I,
if I was ever,
you know,
there's a place to get eaten by a shark.

404
00:22:36.791 --> 00:22:39.940
It is definitely the coasts of your country.
It's so beautiful.

405
00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.660
You'd beat me as well.
At least I was,
you know,
at least you dive beautifully.

406
00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:48.370
Yeah,
I remember we were there in like a,
I don't know when we were,

407
00:22:48.371 --> 00:22:51.670
was your,
your weird winter down there,
which is just the different time.

408
00:22:51.671 --> 00:22:55.660
And it was too,
it was too cold and windy.
Um,
it's not weird.

409
00:22:55.661 --> 00:22:57.520
It's just weird to me cause I'm in the northern hemisphere,

410
00:22:57.521 --> 00:23:00.430
but so we were down there and I was expecting it to be fucking hot and all of a

411
00:23:00.431 --> 00:23:02.640
sudden it was like freezing and uh,

412
00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:04.420
but even then I was looking at and I was like,

413
00:23:04.421 --> 00:23:06.310
if it wasn't so rough and it wasn't so cold,

414
00:23:06.311 --> 00:23:10.810
I think I would add maybe I did actually go into the water when I was in Perth

415
00:23:10.811 --> 00:23:13.120
because I just wanted to say that I stood in the Indian Ocean.

416
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.770
I literally went up to my ankles and I got back in and then I got in the car and

417
00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:21.490
I was listening to the radio and there was a helicopter following and like an 18

418
00:23:21.491 --> 00:23:25.630
foot tiger shark along the beach just to let the surfers and everybody know that

419
00:23:25.631 --> 00:23:26.464
the thing was there.

420
00:23:26.770 --> 00:23:31.770
And you guys had the creepiest terminology ever for when someone gets eaten by a

421
00:23:31.841 --> 00:23:36.780
shark,
you say he was taken.
That's what I heard.
Oh yeah,
it was a something blah,

422
00:23:36.781 --> 00:23:39.010
blah,
blah.
He got taken.
I'm like,
Oh my God,

423
00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:45.410
I'd rather be eaten than taken.
Eaten to me is,
it's over.

424
00:23:45.411 --> 00:23:49.340
I mean it's fucking horrific and that you bleed out and it's over.
Taken means I,

425
00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:51.110
you took me somewhere.

426
00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:54.710
I just started thinking a chainsaw massacre when that fucking guy just grabbed

427
00:23:54.711 --> 00:23:56.840
that woman a yanked her and slammed the door.

428
00:23:57.530 --> 00:24:00.020
So taking almost sounds slightly more polite though.

429
00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:06.650
Not taken well I guess what the next word is taken to the movies.

430
00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:07.923
Right,
exactly.

431
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:15.530
Taken into the fucking movies by some sharks.
Oh yeah,

432
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.780
I was going to say,
you know,
it seems a,
you know what,
I liked it.

433
00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:22.450
This fair play on this album.
Yeah.
As far as a,

434
00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:25.400
there was a few where it was the other person and that was a few.
There was you.

435
00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:27.590
All right.
So that's a a,
that's a,

436
00:24:27.591 --> 00:24:31.720
that's an important milestone in your life when you,
the,

437
00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.570
at least for me it was when I was able to be like,
alright,
you know,

438
00:24:35.571 --> 00:24:38.540
I was going through that dude chicks a fucking Psychos,
you know,

439
00:24:38.541 --> 00:24:42.500
I did that till I was about 35 and I was just like,
all right Phil,
you know,

440
00:24:42.501 --> 00:24:44.240
at what point are you going to fucking is,

441
00:24:44.241 --> 00:24:48.410
it may be you maybe who you're picking maybe what you're bringing to the table.

442
00:24:48.411 --> 00:24:52.400
And then once I was able to do that,
I finally ended up meeting Nia.
I,

443
00:24:52.401 --> 00:24:57.401
that's kind of why I called the album love remains because love remains as in

444
00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.840
the remanence of love.
Like the aftermath of,

445
00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:08.240
of a love gone bad or love remains,
I love still exists.

446
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:12.260
Oh I thought you went,
there was still pieces of other relationships in you.

447
00:25:12.650 --> 00:25:17.120
It's both.
It's like the remnants and then love still,
you know,
continues.

448
00:25:17.121 --> 00:25:18.590
There's always love.
Well,

449
00:25:18.591 --> 00:25:23.120
this is theory among my guy friends that women are able to cry it out cause

450
00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:24.140
you're allowed to cry,

451
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:28.580
that you're able to get passionate and then it's just like fucking gone.

452
00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.420
Where guys like hang on to shit.
I mean,

453
00:25:32.421 --> 00:25:35.090
I was reading this book on Bob Cousy,

454
00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:37.610
he was one of the Great Celtics and Bill Russell,
right?

455
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.010
One of the greatest players of all time.
And Bob Cousy,

456
00:25:40.011 --> 00:25:44.810
his wife passed away and he still has a picture on the wall and he still talks

457
00:25:44.811 --> 00:25:48.560
to her.
I guess they didn't break up.
So maybe it was that.
But like,
you know,

458
00:25:48.561 --> 00:25:52.850
I used to always joke with my wife going,
you know,
if I died within three weeks,

459
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:54.470
should have all my clothes down at goodwill,

460
00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:01.760
you keep me having a DVD in the back of a fucking closet where she's like,
no,

461
00:26:01.761 --> 00:26:06.090
I would never do though.
But I just feel like women are better at,
uh,

462
00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:10.730
e how you're wired.
And then I also think it's more,
it's,
uh,

463
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:15.470
one of the great emotions crying when the great healing emotions is not

464
00:26:15.471 --> 00:26:19.070
acceptable for guys and you just shut it off.

465
00:26:19.071 --> 00:26:22.070
So not only do not get to heal,
you actually make yourself,

466
00:26:22.071 --> 00:26:26.960
I think worse by fucking,
uh,
holding it in.
It's bad enough.
You know?

467
00:26:26.961 --> 00:26:31.220
I don't know.
It's,
it's a really a weird thing.
So,
uh,
that's a,
that's actually,

468
00:26:31.221 --> 00:26:34.200
I don't,
I don't know what the word is,
but to hear you say that,
that,

469
00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.340
that you actually,
uh,
some of it stays in there.

470
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:41.560
I don't know if that makes me feel not as fucked up.
Nah.
We'll also,
like,
I,

471
00:26:41.650 --> 00:26:44.130
I feel like when

472
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.640
<v 1>when you're in love or when you love someone,
like</v>

473
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:53.520
people often like projected outwards as if it's the other person that's making

474
00:26:53.521 --> 00:26:54.390
you in love,

475
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:58.680
whereas like love is actually just always in you and that that person is,

476
00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.670
is maybe igniting it or oh,
is showing you that it's there,

477
00:27:02.671 --> 00:27:07.380
but it is always there.
And knowing that keeps me centered.

478
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:11.730
<v 0>Yeah.
It's,
it's,
it's not something that you can,
it's hard to remember that,</v>

479
00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.460
you know,
I would,
I would say,
I don't know,

480
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:17.110
I'm actually literally getting uncomfortable just even talking about it.

481
00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:20.753
It helps me.

482
00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:25.820
I was walled off for a long fucking time and then I,

483
00:27:26.371 --> 00:27:30.630
I had like this massive amount of love in me and he would just come out in these

484
00:27:30.631 --> 00:27:33.990
weird ways like about like,
like,
uh,

485
00:27:33.991 --> 00:27:38.160
animals being abused or any sort of person being hurt.

486
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:39.390
I could feel it,

487
00:27:39.391 --> 00:27:42.360
but like if I was just with somebody and we're going to the movies,

488
00:27:42.361 --> 00:27:43.950
like I didn't even know what the fuck to do.

489
00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:48.390
I just be sitting there like this fucking robot.
Like,
did you enjoy that?

490
00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:53.700
Now we're getting on the subway.
And it was just like,
and I was meeting people.
I,

491
00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:54.910
I just,
uh,
I know you,

492
00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:59.730
I'm embarrassed at where the kind of person I was back in the day as far as like

493
00:27:59.731 --> 00:28:02.160
trying to get through stuff like that.
But how did you break through that?

494
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.110
I met somebody I couldn't break up with.

495
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:10.400
I would in my head fantasize during tough times of breaking up with my now wife

496
00:28:12.391 --> 00:28:14.580
and in my head we were living in this place where there was,

497
00:28:14.610 --> 00:28:16.200
there was the first place was an elevating.

498
00:28:16.201 --> 00:28:18.690
They'll twice had stairs and when she was going to get on the elevator,

499
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:22.200
even in the fantasy of being single again before the door close,

500
00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:25.530
I would run out and go get her or when she would walk down the stairs at all

501
00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:29.730
right.
I come back in like I couldn't eat.
I couldn't even an a for years.

502
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:35.030
I did that and it never dawned on me like I've always been so fucking like not

503
00:28:35.821 --> 00:28:38.640
in touched with like,
hey bill,
you know,

504
00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:43.050
this is the 20,000 fucking signal.
Like I used to ride around.

505
00:28:43.051 --> 00:28:47.760
I had a paper back in the day and I used to ride around in the morning and I had

506
00:28:47.761 --> 00:28:51.840
memorized comedy routines of my favorite comedians and I would fantasize that I

507
00:28:51.841 --> 00:28:55.470
was doing them in front of the school and it didn't dawn on me at that point.

508
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.800
They hit bill.
Maybe you want to be a comedian.
It didn't.
It was just,

509
00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:03.030
I had no connection to it whatsoever.
Huh.
It was just me.

510
00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.550
I think at that point it was all about,
you know,

511
00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:10.110
getting people to like me so I wouldn't get the shit kicked out of me or I

512
00:29:10.111 --> 00:29:13.230
wouldn't have to deal with some,
you know,
you know,
was,
you know,
it was,

513
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:18.190
it was before all this carrying on social media is just like,
they'll,

514
00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:21.410
the host every day at school was just like,
am I going to get it today or is,

515
00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.040
or how can I get it off of me and get it onto the next week?

516
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:28.980
His kid who was a very weird,
um,
I dunno,
some of it was good,

517
00:29:28.981 --> 00:29:31.500
but a lot of it wasn't a necessarily,

518
00:29:31.501 --> 00:29:35.730
probably the way kids should grow up now.
We're probably like overly doing it.

519
00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:37.440
I don't know.
You don't make me feel good when you came,

520
00:29:37.441 --> 00:29:40.870
when I came into place here and you were like,
oh,
there's my phone.
If,

521
00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:42.010
if I lose my phone all the

522
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.460
<v 1>time,
oh my gosh,
you have massive add.</v>

523
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:49.030
I also unfortunately get phone anxiety,

524
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:54.220
which I hate.
Like,
Oh,
you don't have it,
right.
Yeah.
If I don't have it,

525
00:29:54.221 --> 00:29:57.340
I start to like feel like,
oh shit,
where's the phone?

526
00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.970
Or like if I don't look at it for,
for,

527
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.160
for too long I started to feel that and so I have to work really hard at like

528
00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:09.040
disciplining myself so that I can like keep it away from me for a certain amount

529
00:30:09.041 --> 00:30:13.070
of hours to be like creative and productive.
Cause it's just PR.

530
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:17.560
Like I feel so sorry for like for kids that are like teenagers right now.

531
00:30:17.561 --> 00:30:22.561
Like they just like so attached to their phones and I see what it does to my

532
00:30:23.201 --> 00:30:25.930
brain.
Teenager I am.
That was brutal.
Yeah.

533
00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:30.490
Not like gives you the shortest attention span it like everything's just

534
00:30:30.491 --> 00:30:35.140
immediate.
And so I'm just so glad that like,

535
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:37.240
uh,
it kind of came a little bit later.

536
00:30:37.241 --> 00:30:41.260
You realize we're like lab rats cause we're like sort of the first wave of like,

537
00:30:41.261 --> 00:30:43.690
well let's see what this does to people.
I actually saw,
you know,

538
00:30:43.691 --> 00:30:48.480
I went and I got gas today and I saw this to the Burrito or no,

539
00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:50.920
well that's going to be later.
That's what,

540
00:30:50.921 --> 00:30:54.640
this podcast will not be a full hour whenever you'll know what's hitting me,

541
00:30:54.641 --> 00:30:58.240
what the fuck is on the microphones that are here in fucking nuts,
piece of fuzz.

542
00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:03.070
Um,
so I went up to that still there.
See this is the podcast.

543
00:31:03.071 --> 00:31:07.990
People are used to ghetto.
Um,
so I pulled up to get,

544
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.240
I was getting pumping gas and you know,

545
00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:12.850
this la couple pulls up la meaning beautiful.

546
00:31:12.851 --> 00:31:15.550
I'm not judging them like they're assholes to fucking beautiful rope.

547
00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:18.410
So they pull up and the guy gets out to pump the gas.

548
00:31:18.411 --> 00:31:22.480
The woman's driving the second she barely prospect park,
you know,

549
00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:27.190
the immediately the phone and was just sitting there and I was watching her and

550
00:31:27.191 --> 00:31:30.640
I was just like,
that's me.
That is literally me.

551
00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:35.020
I do that when I'm driving like a lot.
I know.
Fucking terrible.
It's,
yeah,

552
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:37.960
I called a friend up one time,

553
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.530
this is maybe about three months ago.

554
00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:43.630
I was trying to do like an intense period of writing and I said,
hey,

555
00:31:43.631 --> 00:31:45.520
could you just cause I'm,
you know,
it takes like,

556
00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:49.660
I think apparently 28 days to break a habit.
I said,
can you come over for,

557
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:53.230
you know,
28 days apparently as a kid,

558
00:31:53.231 --> 00:31:56.920
you can I give you my phone and then just go away and then I'll meet you back

559
00:31:56.921 --> 00:31:57.754
here.

560
00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:02.460
And I did that for a few days and actually like helped me like reprogram myself.

561
00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:05.110
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
And like once you do that,
then it's like,
ah,

562
00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:08.170
you feel like you can finally relax.
It's weird.

563
00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:12.460
This is something that I learned going overseas and I can't get texts from

564
00:32:12.461 --> 00:32:16.960
anybody.
This is what happens if you don't text anybody.
Nobody texts you.

565
00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:19.570
Like I would come back thinking,
oh my God,

566
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.700
I haven't checked my text messages in 10 days.

567
00:32:21.910 --> 00:32:26.040
I'm going to have 5 million fucking texts.
And I had like maybe six,

568
00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:30.550
seven.
Yeah.
I don't want,
am I a loser?
Nobody like I don't text people.

569
00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:33.520
You're like,
no,
I come back to a zillion of them now.
I feel like an asshole.
No,

570
00:32:33.521 --> 00:32:37.840
I came back and it's like you,
uh,
it's,
it's like,
you know,

571
00:32:37.841 --> 00:32:40.010
like ones do you want something in your life not to happen

572
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.280
<v 0>and you don't realize how much of it you're creating.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well,</v>

573
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:44.960
so much of the phone shit,

574
00:32:45.170 --> 00:32:49.970
I realize I am creating all of the texting that I'm doing.
Like I'm in traffic.

575
00:32:50.150 --> 00:32:54.740
Traffic sucks.
I just start calling people.
Right.
I'm just like,
hey man,

576
00:32:54.741 --> 00:32:56.430
what's going on?
I'm stuck on the fuck.

577
00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.560
I literally have a friend of mine that we like we our friendship cause she's

578
00:33:00.561 --> 00:33:02.270
married with kids.
I'm married,
didn't have a kid.

579
00:33:02.271 --> 00:33:04.820
It was just like our whole relationship.

580
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:06.330
I don't think I've seen her in a year and a half.

581
00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.870
Our relationship that we have the deal,
the,

582
00:33:08.871 --> 00:33:12.560
an unwritten deal is that we call each other when we're stuck in traffic.
Yeah.

583
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:17.210
Then the big joke is,
hey,
I'm on the one 35.
Hey,
I'm on the one on one.
Yup.

584
00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:20.090
And then that's in the or the other person picks up.
All right,
where are you?

585
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.010
How long a drive do you have?
And it's just like,

586
00:33:22.011 --> 00:33:25.760
you're sort of almost like a suicide hotline,
talking them to get home.

587
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:30.320
<v 1>I do like all of my phone calls in the car to or um,</v>

588
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:34.420
really,
really late at night.
Like while I'm getting ready for bed.
Like,

589
00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:39.140
like my friends in Australia just know that I'm going to call it like 3:00 AM my

590
00:33:39.141 --> 00:33:42.110
time.
Like facetiming them while I'm like brushing my teeth and shit.

591
00:33:42.111 --> 00:33:45.270
And now it's like a ritual.
Like,
oh,
are you ready for teeth brushing time

592
00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:49.570
<v 0>and what is it like seven the next day they're right.
Seven at night,</v>

593
00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:52.850
14 year olds or even slightly.
Yeah,
something like that.
Yeah,
around,

594
00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:54.370
around about then it's great that guy,

595
00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.570
I always call Australia at that time when I'm getting ready for bed time.

596
00:33:58.571 --> 00:34:02.470
That was the last time you heard some music that that made you?
Uh,

597
00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.600
like whenever I listened to like amazing music,

598
00:34:04.601 --> 00:34:07.480
I always fantasize that it's me doing it.
Oh yeah,
yeah,

599
00:34:07.481 --> 00:34:09.850
I do that on all the way through the song.
If the drums are awesome,

600
00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:12.730
I'm playing drums,
someone singing great,
then all of a sudden I'm doing that.

601
00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:14.230
I'm very self involved.

602
00:34:14.390 --> 00:34:18.850
When was the last time you as a musician listened to something and you were just

603
00:34:18.851 --> 00:34:20.590
like,
ah fuck,
I wish that was me.

604
00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:23.920
<v 1>Does that happen?
I don't know.</v>

605
00:34:23.921 --> 00:34:28.270
It doesn't happen but strike too with the texting and now fantasy,

606
00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:33.000
the fantasizing.
I don't do that but I,

607
00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:37.180
I listened to admire a lot of people.
Who Do you listen to coming up?

608
00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.980
I didn't want to ask you any of these questions.

609
00:34:38.981 --> 00:34:40.840
I know you've been asked this man.
Fuck.

610
00:34:40.841 --> 00:34:44.350
I listened to miles Davis and then of course there was the bgs,

611
00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.580
jazz disco.
I just,

612
00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:50.620
you know what I'm really obsessed with is his Indian classical music.

613
00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:51.640
Do you remember that time?

614
00:34:51.641 --> 00:34:55.750
We were like driving back from one of your shows and I played you some Indian

615
00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.170
Indian classical music.
I played you,

616
00:34:59.171 --> 00:35:02.770
I remember we were meeting and me and Josh were singing some Song Bob Dylan Song

617
00:35:02.771 --> 00:35:06.100
to you,
which you really didn't like or you are making fun of.

618
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.250
But Bob Dylan is like one of my favorites of all time.
I love Bob doing okay.

619
00:35:09.251 --> 00:35:12.370
But like you were like joking around like changing the lyrics and stuff.

620
00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.880
I was just being an ass.
I was fine with me if we do that all the time.

621
00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.320
But you made me laugh so much and then I played you in Indian classical piece

622
00:35:20.380 --> 00:35:21.460
but maybe you don't remember that.

623
00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:25.320
But what I remember you playing that Blues Song.
Yeah,

624
00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:29.590
that was blind Willie Johnson.
Yes.
Also one of my faves.
Yes.
Okay.
Yeah,

625
00:35:29.650 --> 00:35:34.210
that I remember.
Yeah.
I love old blues.
Like it's so raw and real.
Right.

626
00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:38.820
And I also like,
like,
cause if you,
you'll notice like on my album,

627
00:35:38.821 --> 00:35:42.930
like I switch in and out of like time signatures a lot and,

628
00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.090
but it doesn't sound like I'm switching time secrets.

629
00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:47.810
She's at least that's what I do tell us the things that I yeah,

630
00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:50.850
I didn't really notice that,
but that's what I'm saying.
Like because I kind of,

631
00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:54.360
I let the music,
um,

632
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:58.890
like the melody or the story guide the time as opposed to like the other way

633
00:35:58.891 --> 00:35:59.610
around.
Like,

634
00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:04.200
sometimes people will write the music first and then that lay the melody and

635
00:36:04.201 --> 00:36:05.100
stuff on top.
Oh,

636
00:36:05.101 --> 00:36:07.770
I saw an interview with somebody said that said every time I come up with the

637
00:36:07.771 --> 00:36:11.340
riff,
it's in a weird time signature and then the drummer fixes it.

638
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:15.390
And I remember thinking like,
this should've fucking kept it.
Right.
Getting that.

639
00:36:15.391 --> 00:36:18.210
Yeah,
but like fuck do I know.
But I'm just saying that that's what I,

640
00:36:18.211 --> 00:36:21.010
that's what I would think.
Yeah.
Like I was joking around like with uh,

641
00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:25.700
with Bob Weir because like basically he,
he played with Lightening Hopkins.

642
00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:31.230
Bob,
we're here shooting grateful dead right now.
He played with lightening.

643
00:36:31.231 --> 00:36:35.240
Hopkins is one of my favorite like blues players.
And um,

644
00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:38.440
I know when he started,
like those guys were all like in their forties,
right?

645
00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:39.593
Yeah.
Guys at me.

646
00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:43.710
And he was joking around like saying that like lightening played like the 12 and

647
00:36:43.711 --> 00:36:46.350
a half bar blues because you know,

648
00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:49.590
if he has to add a beat to finish the story,

649
00:36:49.591 --> 00:36:51.180
he's telling me he's going to add a beat.

650
00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:55.830
Like it's not about like just this rigid thing.
And like I was,

651
00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:57.600
I've been composing like that too.

652
00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:01.560
Like if the melody wants to go on a few beats longer or you know,

653
00:37:01.561 --> 00:37:03.450
then make it a buyer seven like,

654
00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:06.780
and it will feel natural if it goes with the melody.

655
00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:10.140
But if you try to fit a melody over the top of the time signature than sometimes

656
00:37:10.141 --> 00:37:13.920
it can feel a little bit more um,
choppy.
Yeah,
I get that.
Yeah,

657
00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:16.560
because then it's the cause to the lay person.

658
00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.380
They're not listening what time it says no,

659
00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:20.400
they're just following the melody and the story.

660
00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:23.070
And it's the same with that old folk music too.

661
00:37:23.071 --> 00:37:26.850
Like you listen to some of the old folk like you hear like bars of five and

662
00:37:26.851 --> 00:37:30.210
seven cause it just adding beats to like finish the phrase.

663
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:34.110
I know I never noticed and that's sometimes why like you know,

664
00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:36.760
they won't be drums on it.
Like if there was drums it,

665
00:37:36.761 --> 00:37:38.760
it probably would sound kind of strange,

666
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:41.160
but it's just like an acoustic guitar and a voice.

667
00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:44.100
Like that song I played for you,
that Bob Dylan Song,
it's called,

668
00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:45.600
it's all right mom,
any bleeding.

669
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.570
Like there's some bars have like five and shit in that.

670
00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:52.350
He just like add some beets and as you were you wouldn't know it but if you

671
00:37:52.351 --> 00:37:57.150
counted it,
it's odd because he's just trying to fit the lyric in.
Ah,
yeah,

672
00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:02.100
it's genius.
I love it.
How hello can be so talented in that area.
Like when,

673
00:38:02.101 --> 00:38:05.040
when did,
when did you notice that shit?
Like I would just be like,

674
00:38:05.041 --> 00:38:08.220
I'm just psyched if I listen to a song,
I know all the words.
I wouldn't be like,

675
00:38:08.221 --> 00:38:09.570
oh that was just in seven

676
00:38:12.090 --> 00:38:16.890
when I first moved to America and I was playing guitar.

677
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:21.420
I and I was like starting to play like six hours a day and I like gave myself a

678
00:38:21.421 --> 00:38:24.770
tendinitis and I had to stop playing for a minute and then I started like,

679
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:29.490
like messing around like with drums with one hand or like base with one hand.

680
00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:33.990
And people started coming up to me being like,
yeah,
mini Vinny,
Vinny,
Vinny.

681
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:38.860
And I'm like,
what the fuck is many Vinny,
you know,
of any color Uda.
Uh,

682
00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.920
okay.
So I went and like listened to Vinnie Khalida,

683
00:38:42.250 --> 00:38:46.390
this is me at I guess like 17 now and uh,

684
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.830
and everyone was passing around tapes of,

685
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:53.540
of Vinny color you'd like all like the stuff with charisma and um,

686
00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:56.490
just a bunch of other stuff.
And uh,

687
00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.590
and actually Vinnie was then one of the first people I met when,

688
00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:03.850
when I moved to America because he came to my school and I'd been playing for

689
00:39:03.851 --> 00:39:06.370
two and a half months at the time.
And like one of the,

690
00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:10.090
the these drum clinicians was friends with him.
Wait a minute,

691
00:39:10.091 --> 00:39:13.920
you don't even play in two and a half months if somebody told you to move to no

692
00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:18.730
base space.
Cause I'd been playing guitar for a couple of years.
Yeah.
Yeah.

693
00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:23.320
What was that like?
And he was like,
oh,
we should play some time.
I said,
yeah.

694
00:39:23.321 --> 00:39:27.580
And I was so shy,
like,
because I listened to all this stuff and obviously his,

695
00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:31.720
he's one of the best in the world and I was,
but I kept it in my head.
I'm like,

696
00:39:31.721 --> 00:39:34.870
okay,
okay.
But then I moved to New York and I was like,

697
00:39:34.871 --> 00:39:36.790
I just want to be a jazz musician.

698
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:40.150
I want to like play in clubs like five times a night.

699
00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:44.090
And like Charlie Parker and monk and the guys did.
And,

700
00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:48.230
and I did that for a few years.
And then that's when like,
I,
I,
uh,

701
00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.720
played with the Allman brothers and like made a record,

702
00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:53.770
played with the almond brothers.
That was my first Gig when I was a teenager.

703
00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:57.880
Jesus.
Yeah.
Christ.
Yeah.
Like that's where it all started.

704
00:39:58.090 --> 00:40:01.570
And then I came back to La and I like played Vinnie this stuff with the Allman

705
00:40:01.571 --> 00:40:05.560
brothers and my,
um,
my solo project.
And,
uh,

706
00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:09.820
and then the weeks later he got the call from Jeff Beck that like,
Oh,

707
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:12.880
hit Jeff Beck's management that they needed a bass player.
And then he,

708
00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:16.900
he told them about me and then they called me and they asked me to send in
tapes.

709
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:20.710
I sending in the tapes and the next thing I knew I was flying to England to

710
00:40:20.711 --> 00:40:25.430
audition for Jeff.
So,
and then everything like,
you know,
prince and her whole,
you,

711
00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:31.080
um,
I think I was 21 when I started playing with Jeff.
Yeah,
he's correct.

712
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:34.870
That's the first time I saw you live at Ronnie Scott's,

713
00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.720
which I've still never been in.
Another couple of times I've gone to London.

714
00:40:37.721 --> 00:40:39.880
I always assumed it's always like packed.
I'm like,
Oh fuck,

715
00:40:39.881 --> 00:40:42.900
I want to go in there and just,
yeah,
have a drink,
an extra,

716
00:40:42.901 --> 00:40:45.250
listen to some music for like two sites the first time I saw you.

717
00:40:45.251 --> 00:40:49.090
So were you nervous when you went into the audition?
Um,

718
00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:54.040
well I was food poisoned.
I just got enough of plain like where the,

719
00:40:54.330 --> 00:40:58.930
and Vinnie went to the airport and I ate some barbecue chicken pizza and I got

720
00:40:58.931 --> 00:41:02.170
on the plane and Vinnie is like raving on about politics because he's obsessed

721
00:41:02.171 --> 00:41:06.040
with politics and I'm like,
hey Vinny,
I'm feeling kind of sick.

722
00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:11.200
And uh,
he's like,
yeah,
yeah.
Um,
so then this happened and you know,
I mean,

723
00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:14.830
he kind of reminds me of you and you're writing me of him.
He was from,
uh,

724
00:41:14.831 --> 00:41:19.720
he's from like Pennsylvania.
Oh,
is he?
Yeah.
Oh No.
Yeah,
Pittsburgh.
Oh,

725
00:41:19.721 --> 00:41:22.360
he's from Pittsburgh as a Pittsburgh guy.
Oh,
you went to Berkeley.

726
00:41:22.361 --> 00:41:25.690
That's why I knew there was some sort of Massachusetts from there.
Yeah.

727
00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:27.490
But anyway,
he's going on about politics.

728
00:41:27.491 --> 00:41:30.910
And then meanwhile I just like throw up in a bag and I'm like,
there it is.

729
00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:33.380
He's like,
yeah,
what is,
I'm like,
I'll see you in 10 hours.

730
00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:35.090
And I was so sick that like,

731
00:41:35.091 --> 00:41:39.380
then I had to let get rushed to the hospital and we landed and like be on a
drip.

732
00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:44.120
And then the next day I auditioned for Jeff and so I was feeling really

733
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:49.440
<v 0>weird.
But um,
talk about the worst fucking place to get food poisoning.</v>

734
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:50.550
Oh my God.

735
00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:51.140
<v 1>Did they?
Oh,</v>

736
00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:54.230
but the audition went well because at that point I was so like woozy that I was

737
00:41:54.231 --> 00:41:56.720
just like,
okay,
let's get through this.
Yeah.

738
00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:00.770
And then that was the point where like Jeff pointed to me and said,
solo on,

739
00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:05.390
cause we've ended his lovers and like he ended up loving that so much that he

740
00:42:05.391 --> 00:42:08.690
like kept it in the set.
And that's how he was like featuring me every night.

741
00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.050
Oh Wow.
How that

742
00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:15.760
<v 0>like a cool of him totally sharing who he is and all of that stuff too,</v>

743
00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:19.560
to like,
uh,
I love when people do stuff like that.

744
00:42:19.561 --> 00:42:24.210
There's a lot of comedians that I,
you know,
um,
that I'm a fan of.

745
00:42:24.211 --> 00:42:25.950
But what really makes me,
you know,

746
00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:30.480
over the top is when I see them like encouraging and helping out,

747
00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:36.000
you know,
pick comics that are coming up.
Cause I,
I hate that fucking thing of,
uh,

748
00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:39.480
you know,
that behavior people will get to a certain level,

749
00:42:39.490 --> 00:42:42.870
then they start treating,
you know,
I don't know.
I'm here and you're there.

750
00:42:42.871 --> 00:42:46.350
It's all stupid.
It's just like,
it's,
you know,
you're great like that.

751
00:42:46.351 --> 00:42:50.050
Like the way that you kind of mentor younger comedians by,
I mean,
I,

752
00:42:50.051 --> 00:42:54.600
I try not to be in it.
I mean,
I remember most people were nice,

753
00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:58.770
but I definitely remember who the people who weren't necessarily the names,

754
00:42:58.771 --> 00:43:01.900
but I just remember what,
how that made me feel.
So it's,

755
00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:04.350
it's sorta the same thing too.
Um,

756
00:43:05.610 --> 00:43:07.320
both being like a parent and stuff.

757
00:43:07.830 --> 00:43:10.680
I remember the good days at school and I remember the bad day,

758
00:43:10.681 --> 00:43:14.160
so I remember how much fun it was playing with the other kids at school.

759
00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:18.960
And then I also remember how bad it was if you know you wore the wrong shirt or

760
00:43:18.961 --> 00:43:19.651
whatever and it's just,

761
00:43:19.651 --> 00:43:22.560
it was just your day to take the pounding and just like how you could just

762
00:43:22.561 --> 00:43:24.750
literally beginning that was literally like your world.

763
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.290
And that's something that I'm hoping I'm going to be able to remember.
Um,

764
00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:32.130
which I think I Willis as Mike,
my kids going through school as far as uh,

765
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.550
knowing that though,
I mean those days,

766
00:43:35.551 --> 00:43:38.040
I mean who the hell knows with all the fucking cameras out there,

767
00:43:38.041 --> 00:43:40.800
I don't know if you get a little gift,
anything.
My buddy was just telling me,

768
00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:41.881
you know,

769
00:43:41.881 --> 00:43:46.290
some key told this story where there was some kid everybody picked on that day

770
00:43:46.291 --> 00:43:47.790
and then the kids who picked on him,

771
00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:50.220
they found out who all of them were and they had to go see the fucking

772
00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:54.030
psychologists and shit.
And I was really thinking about that.
It's just like,

773
00:43:54.031 --> 00:43:57.390
wow man.
Like nobody,
like there was none of that at all.

774
00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.370
Like the guidance counselor was just some Weirdo down the hall and he would
just,

775
00:44:02.430 --> 00:44:03.640
he just would talk to,

776
00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:08.400
he would only really talk to kids who had no hope of going to college.
Right.

777
00:44:08.970 --> 00:44:12.300
And he'd just be down.
They're like,
well,
hey man,
you know,
like maybe a,

778
00:44:12.301 --> 00:44:16.650
you get into construction,
you know?
I mean,
I never even talked to him.
I just,

779
00:44:16.651 --> 00:44:19.980
I don't know what he talked to them about maybe their home lives and shit.

780
00:44:19.981 --> 00:44:24.000
Maybe it was like a therapy thing,
but like,
only the fucked up kids,

781
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:28.080
God guidance.
Right.
It was weird.
Everybody else was just like,
all right,
you're,

782
00:44:28.090 --> 00:44:31.920
you're following the cattle right over the fucking cliff to school.

783
00:44:31.921 --> 00:44:35.730
Two years of language.
Get into college,
pick a major,

784
00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:39.390
decide what the fuck you want to do at 18 and then it,
yeah,

785
00:44:39.391 --> 00:44:40.770
it was one of those things.
And,
um,

786
00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.340
<v 1>I remember when I was 15,
um,</v>

787
00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.760
there was like this like woman that came to the school that was supposedly like

788
00:44:46.761 --> 00:44:51.761
a career counselor and she came up with this huge book that looked like yellow

789
00:44:52.941 --> 00:44:57.420
pages or something.
Right?
And everyone had to have an appointment and,

790
00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:00.890
and you'd go in and she'd be like,
okay,
so now what do you want to do?

791
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:04.240
And like someone to be like,
I want to be a
[inaudible],

792
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:09.500
open up the book.
And she looked on the doctor and so I walked in,
she's like,

793
00:45:09.501 --> 00:45:13.400
so what do you want to do?
I'm like,
that would be a musician.
And she's like,

794
00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:18.650
sorry,
there's no musician here.
What else would you like to do?
I just walked out.

795
00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:23.210
Oh,
you walked down.
What does she do?
I don't know.
That was it.

796
00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:26.900
I would have,
yeah.
I want to have like an epiphany being like,
wow,
I made,

797
00:45:26.901 --> 00:45:29.630
how many of these fucking kids wanted to do something that's not in this book,

798
00:45:29.631 --> 00:45:31.610
right?
Yeah.
But then you have to look at her.

799
00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.950
It's just like there's no way that was her dream in life.

800
00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:38.210
To have a yellow book and talk to people half your age.
What do you want to do?

801
00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:42.530
I want to be a zookeeper.
All right,
let's get to the disease.
All right.

802
00:45:43.010 --> 00:45:44.510
Do you have any khaki shorts?

803
00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000
So you literally have somebody who didn't follow a dream talking you out of

804
00:45:52.101 --> 00:45:55.880
yours and you had the strength to fucking walk away from that.
That's very,

805
00:45:55.881 --> 00:45:58.360
very commendable.
So that's the,
those are the

806
00:45:59.530 --> 00:46:03.400
<v 0>moments in life there to haunt me that I think that into my life when somebody</v>

807
00:46:03.401 --> 00:46:06.470
said something negative and thank God,
you know,
I,

808
00:46:06.471 --> 00:46:10.270
I didn't latch onto a totally and somebody else like,
cause I have like,

809
00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:15.370
I have like this like three Mike moments in my life,
you know,

810
00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:20.820
like climbing up a fucking cliff that if I went to go this way I would have fell

811
00:46:21.521 --> 00:46:25.930
back down and,
and just the luck of it sometimes when I think of it like,
God,

812
00:46:25.931 --> 00:46:30.640
what if I didn't meet this person?
You know,
and why?
Reading my,

813
00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:33.880
I worked with this guy in a warehouse and I finally found somebody that was into

814
00:46:33.881 --> 00:46:38.290
comedy the way I was and he understood that you could become it.

815
00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:41.080
You know what I mean?
Like he was going like,
dude,

816
00:46:41.081 --> 00:46:42.700
these guys on TV and not funny man,

817
00:46:42.701 --> 00:46:45.730
one of these days I'm going to take a shot of Jack Daniels and just go on stage

818
00:46:45.731 --> 00:46:49.180
and do it.
And all of a sudden like,
cause it just,
you know,

819
00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:51.670
it was on TV that was like a million miles away.

820
00:46:51.671 --> 00:46:54.490
There was no fucking internet or anything.
And uh,
we had,

821
00:46:54.491 --> 00:46:58.530
nobody had video cameras,
nothing.
So it just seemed impossible to me.

822
00:46:58.550 --> 00:47:01.450
It was so impossible.
It didn't even seem impossible.
Didn't even,

823
00:47:01.451 --> 00:47:04.570
I didn't even enter my brain be like fucking going to the moon and all of a

824
00:47:04.571 --> 00:47:06.850
sudden he was just next to me going,
I'm going to fucking do it.

825
00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:11.140
I was just thinking like,
well shit,
if he can try it,
I'm going to try it.
So,
uh,

826
00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:14.850
if I don't run into him and if he doesn't have the balls to Sam,

827
00:47:14.851 --> 00:47:15.491
I'm going to try it.

828
00:47:15.491 --> 00:47:20.491
Then I'm just fucking hanging out with other knuckleheads like me drinking then,

829
00:47:21.550 --> 00:47:24.190
then all of a sudden I'm 30 and where the fuck am I?
You know?
So

830
00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:26.900
<v 1>do you believe like in like a destiny,</v>

831
00:47:26.901 --> 00:47:28.430
like do you believe that if that wouldn't have happened,

832
00:47:28.431 --> 00:47:29.980
something else would have happened?
Or do you

833
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.210
<v 0>believe like,
I don't believe in destiny because of tragedy,
right?</v>

834
00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:37.150
I don't think that anybody's destiny is there.
The Hey,

835
00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:41.470
thank God you're not this person.
I just think you get lucky.
You get lucky.

836
00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:44.170
It's,
it's like a half court shot,

837
00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:49.130
I would say in a lot of weight.
Well,
maybe it's not that it's,

838
00:47:49.131 --> 00:47:53.950
it's don't you think it's like partly luck and partly manifestation.

839
00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:55.960
Like if you really want something,

840
00:47:55.961 --> 00:47:58.810
you're going to create the path forward and it can,

841
00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:03.820
and it can go in many directions.
Yeah.
But I also feel like,

842
00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:07.950
and there's also tragedy,
which is unavoidable and,
um,

843
00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:12.760
unpredictable.
The tragedy of where you're born,
right?
What you'll look like,

844
00:48:12.761 --> 00:48:15.310
what race you are.
We're part of the world.
You're in.

845
00:48:15.311 --> 00:48:20.150
Like how lucky I was to be a white guy born in USA,
you know what I mean?
And,

846
00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:22.810
and how lucky I was to be born outside of Boston and had this crazy,

847
00:48:22.811 --> 00:48:26.860
insane seeing this like a lot of like,

848
00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:31.420
you know,
hurdles that were like this big for.
And even then,
even then,

849
00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:36.010
because of all the bullshit,
uh,

850
00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.340
that even just,
even if you get that much of a head start,

851
00:48:39.341 --> 00:48:43.750
all of this other shit that can emotionally fuck you up can,

852
00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:49.600
um,
you know,
I mean,
I think by the time I was like nine,
uh,

853
00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:53.890
I,
I,
I had already just sort of like,
I had that,
yeah,

854
00:48:53.891 --> 00:48:56.460
I don't give a fuck.
I don't give a fuck.
I don't,
yeah,

855
00:48:56.500 --> 00:49:00.490
I just didn't give a shit like,
and,
but,
and,
but I did,
you know what I mean?

856
00:49:00.491 --> 00:49:04.420
And then that's all your work to get back to that person who did care and did

857
00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:07.210
want stuff.
You just,
as a defense mechanism,
you just like,
yeah,

858
00:49:07.211 --> 00:49:10.000
I don't give a fuck.
Oh,
really?
Is that going to happen?
No.

859
00:49:10.001 --> 00:49:13.380
And then then when that's supposed to,
what make me cry.
Fuck you.
Like I,

860
00:49:13.381 --> 00:49:17.530
I became that person,
which is,
uh,
it's,

861
00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:21.640
it works as far as to get through that shit.

862
00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.540
But as far as getting anything that you fucking want in life,

863
00:49:25.541 --> 00:49:30.010
we have to be open and warm and attract stuff to you that you want and you're

864
00:49:30.011 --> 00:49:32.740
over there with you.
Oh yeah.
I don't give a fuck.
Fuck you really,

865
00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:37.630
400 pounds and my chest put 500.
I don't give a fuck to in that dumb guy.
Shit.

866
00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:43.630
Um,
yeah,
there's like,
yeah,
it's just,
yeah,
that's the,

867
00:49:43.631 --> 00:49:46.780
that's the thing when you're sitting there and at fucking Boston Garden going,

868
00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:51.310
how to fuck if I didn't meet this guy,
if that guy didn't say that,

869
00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:54.310
if I went out that night and went with those people and did that,

870
00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:57.070
you just think of all of that fucking what if shit.

871
00:49:57.550 --> 00:50:00.490
And there's somebody who went out that night and went with those people and then

872
00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:04.450
the fucking sitting in a cubicle or a jail cell or in a fucking loveless

873
00:50:04.451 --> 00:50:05.260
marriage or something.

874
00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:09.280
And then just like why the f that that's somebody's destiny to be in a loveless

875
00:50:09.281 --> 00:50:12.490
marriage?
Is that like I just,
I don't,
um,
yeah,

876
00:50:12.491 --> 00:50:16.390
and Karmas and other one I don't buy into,
I think calmer works.
If you,
if you,

877
00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:19.750
if you believe in it,
what do you,
how do you define Karma?

878
00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:22.960
That basically if you're a good person,
good things happen to you,

879
00:50:22.961 --> 00:50:25.300
but if you're a bad person,
that's not what comment is though.

880
00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:29.240
But in my world it is,
but common,
just like if you like,

881
00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:33.530
comment simply means cause and effect.
So,
okay,

882
00:50:33.531 --> 00:50:36.260
well if you do good things then no,
it's not a bad,
good or bad.

883
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:39.020
It's just you feel like I'm in school again.
No,
no,
but you do it.
You do.

884
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:41.780
Can you just give me the F fund?
Although summer school this f

885
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:49.150
not like you,
you,
you,
you do an action and it causes a result.
Right?

886
00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:53.210
It's as simple as that.
That's all Karma means.

887
00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.240
That's like being a safeness.

888
00:50:56.241 --> 00:50:59.170
People thinks that you believe in the devil and people were just like,
ah,

889
00:50:59.270 --> 00:51:03.410
satanism or whatever.
They don't even believe in a heaven or hell or a devil,

890
00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:06.680
but it's just they just living for themselves and everybody's like,
oh,

891
00:51:06.681 --> 00:51:08.600
they were into the devil.
So I was so calm.
I was like,

892
00:51:08.601 --> 00:51:11.580
if you're a fucking nurse or the bad should help us here.

893
00:51:11.581 --> 00:51:15.680
And then in my much business I'd watched these fucking people stealing and doing

894
00:51:15.681 --> 00:51:20.120
all this shit and just look at them and be like,
well,
you know,
you know,

895
00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:23.030
nothing's bad is happening to them and I've done a bunch of bad shit and like

896
00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:24.920
overall my life is good.
But I,
you know,

897
00:51:24.921 --> 00:51:29.540
I've heard a lot of people and shit so and so what is it that it just,

898
00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:34.310
it just simply means that you do an action and it creates a result.

899
00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:39.320
So all these people are using that term incorrectly.
Yes.

900
00:51:39.590 --> 00:51:41.840
I just put it in a script incorrectly.

901
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:45.110
Well for sold eight F F is for family.
Well,

902
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.410
it's correct in that because a lot of people think that that's what it,

903
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:52.730
what it is.
But like when you go to the root of what Karma is,

904
00:51:52.731 --> 00:51:56.150
it just simply means like you do an action and it's cause and effect.

905
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:59.120
I saw somebody,
uh,
somebody I follow on Instagram,

906
00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.690
they had a picture of a boomerang and it said Karma on it.

907
00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:06.770
So that's actually wrong.
Oh my God,

908
00:52:06.771 --> 00:52:09.770
I wish I knew the real definition than I could have been that pompous ass on the

909
00:52:09.771 --> 00:52:11.840
Internet feeding like actually none of you guys,

910
00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:15.950
that's like one time I saw this guy talking about how he didn't have white

911
00:52:15.951 --> 00:52:19.970
privilege and his idea that he didn't have white privileges because he wasn't

912
00:52:19.971 --> 00:52:23.780
born rich and he had to work for the things that he had.

913
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:28.250
So his idea is that white privilege is means you're born on a yacht and all of

914
00:52:28.251 --> 00:52:30.260
this fucking shit.
It's like,
no,
that's not what that means.

915
00:52:30.830 --> 00:52:34.310
That means that no point where you with because of your seat and just get pulled

916
00:52:34.311 --> 00:52:38.690
over for being white,
get the shit kicked out of you,
you know,
and all,

917
00:52:38.691 --> 00:52:41.330
all of these other things that would have happened to you.
You just,

918
00:52:41.331 --> 00:52:45.050
you basically because you had to work for things,
you feel you're not privileged.

919
00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:48.650
So literally his definition was privileged.

920
00:52:51.050 --> 00:52:54.020
I always,
I can't give you any more details of it,

921
00:52:54.021 --> 00:52:58.850
I'll tell you afterwards because it's,
how do you deal with like,
um,

922
00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:01.850
Internet trolley type people?
Like,

923
00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:06.170
have you ever struggled with that or wanted to interact with people like that?

924
00:53:06.171 --> 00:53:09.740
Early on I did,
but now it has nothing to do with me.
Yeah.
Yeah.

925
00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:10.490
It has nothing to do.

926
00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:13.520
The amount of shit that I hate that really just has to do with me and my day.

927
00:53:13.740 --> 00:53:16.700
Right.
That I do.
And I let people do that too.
I don't think,
um,

928
00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:21.110
you know any different than they are.
But like,
um,
yeah,

929
00:53:21.111 --> 00:53:22.920
I don't give a fuck.
I don't know.

930
00:53:23.090 --> 00:53:26.460
It'd have to be a specific thing that I did and I thought it was bad too.

931
00:53:26.461 --> 00:53:28.870
And then everybody said you shouldn't have done that,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

932
00:53:28.920 --> 00:53:33.810
I don't know if I,
I dunno what I,
but if it's just like a,
you know,
you know,

933
00:53:33.811 --> 00:53:36.840
so much of whatever you post isn't about what you posted.

934
00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:39.080
It's about what's in the background.
Wait,

935
00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:41.940
so you gotta be so you could do some gravy.
Oh my God,
that's fucking great.

936
00:53:41.941 --> 00:53:46.350
But what's up with that fucking picture on the wall?
Laughing my ass off.

937
00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:48.730
Like that's like,
but what I learned after a while,

938
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:51.990
it's like that's their moment right on the thread,
right?

939
00:53:51.991 --> 00:53:54.900
Like I'm going to be the guy that notices the thing that starts and then

940
00:53:54.901 --> 00:53:57.420
everybody's talking about what I wanted to talk about.

941
00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:01.680
And then it's this weird thing where you feel good,
but like I,
I,

942
00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:03.180
I do the same thing.

943
00:54:03.181 --> 00:54:06.080
If I send out a tweet and it gets a bunch of retweets and likes,
I'm like,

944
00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:09.480
all right,
people thought that was funny.
So I'm just on the other end of it.

945
00:54:09.481 --> 00:54:14.160
So I just learned like I can't get upset that somebody is noticing something in

946
00:54:14.161 --> 00:54:16.770
this and now they're doing their little show.
Like who the fuck am I?
It's like,

947
00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:19.620
you don't want someone to do that.
Don't post something on there.

948
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.240
And I just look at like,
listen,

949
00:54:21.241 --> 00:54:24.420
you don't want people saying a bunch of bad shit about you.

950
00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:27.240
Don't put your face on the Internet.
It's like you're literally asking for it.

951
00:54:27.241 --> 00:54:28.760
You're sticking your chin out.
Yeah.

952
00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:31.860
And they're winding up and punching you and then you're acting like a victim.

953
00:54:31.861 --> 00:54:35.220
It's like,
well you fucking don't post shit.

954
00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:39.270
Just sit there like this or you know,
post it,

955
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:42.600
take a few shots and uh,
continue on.
I guess

956
00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:47.440
<v 1>as a musician like I'm a little firstly like as an instrumental musician,</v>

957
00:54:47.650 --> 00:54:52.180
there's nothing anybody can say about like what I'm saying,

958
00:54:52.181 --> 00:54:55.660
I'm not expressing an opinion,
I'm just playing.
No.
Right.

959
00:54:55.930 --> 00:55:00.930
But then now I've just put out an album of songs with lyrics and there's only

960
00:55:01.061 --> 00:55:02.590
been out there for a right know.

961
00:55:02.591 --> 00:55:05.650
What I'm saying is that in the context of the song,

962
00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:10.330
and I'm very much expressing like stories that are personal but like to go out

963
00:55:10.331 --> 00:55:13.780
there as a comedian and like express really strong opinions.

964
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:17.980
Like I can't imagine like the difference in like the kind of feedback that you

965
00:55:17.981 --> 00:55:18.814
get.
And

966
00:55:18.830 --> 00:55:22.880
<v 0>I guess I'm curious what people do is you have to understand that what they do</v>

967
00:55:22.881 --> 00:55:25.240
is they don't,
like I've always said,
he's like,

968
00:55:25.241 --> 00:55:28.790
you can do 80 jokes in a row and someone will sit there laughing and enjoying

969
00:55:28.791 --> 00:55:32.060
your set,
and then the 81st one has to do something about them.

970
00:55:32.061 --> 00:55:33.860
If it's a fat joke in their fat,

971
00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:38.120
if it's about women and they are a woman or it's about this state and there from

972
00:55:38.121 --> 00:55:40.820
there,
and then all of a sudden,
yeah,
it's funny you say that,
then they go,

973
00:55:40.821 --> 00:55:45.810
that statement you made about Arkansas and it's just like,
no,

974
00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:49.400
no,
no,
no.
They were all so they all,
all jokes except for the one.
Right.

975
00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:54.140
You know what I mean?
So there's this,
this,
that,
um,
you know,
there's just that,

976
00:55:54.141 --> 00:55:57.710
that thing,
I just,
I don't pay it any mind.

977
00:55:58.460 --> 00:55:59.630
And um,

978
00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:00.980
<v 2>yeah,</v>

979
00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:05.920
<v 0>yeah.
If there was ever any sort of big dust up about something,
I said,</v>

980
00:56:05.921 --> 00:56:08.800
if I actually looked at it and thought I said something wrong,
I'd be like,

981
00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:11.480
alright,
well maybe I'll phrase it a different way.
But like I,

982
00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:15.220
I do think it's absolutely ridiculous that people get offended about a joke that

983
00:56:15.221 --> 00:56:19.840
was told that a show that they weren't at and that was taken so out of context

984
00:56:19.841 --> 00:56:21.400
and no,
you want it to show.
Yeah.

985
00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:24.700
And you chose to click on that thing and the tears.
And another thing too,

986
00:56:24.701 --> 00:56:27.370
if the comedian didn't film it and post it,

987
00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:30.580
if just some fucking asshole in the crowd,
they'd get mad at them.

988
00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:31.631
And it's just like,
well,

989
00:56:31.631 --> 00:56:35.440
what the fuck are you doing if you're this easily offended about standup comedy,

990
00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:40.120
what are you doing watching,
watching standup comedy?
The whole thing is,
so like,

991
00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:41.950
I just saw,
I think it was in Australia,

992
00:56:41.951 --> 00:56:46.750
like the first mammal went extinct due to glue a human global warming and

993
00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:51.640
barely,
barely a word about it.
But like all of this shit,

994
00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:54.550
you know,
fucking,
you know,

995
00:56:54.551 --> 00:56:57.640
it's more difficult to be a comedian if you're a woman.

996
00:56:57.641 --> 00:57:00.550
A fucking me too.
Uh,

997
00:57:00.551 --> 00:57:04.740
it's all about us and what we're going through and Llama,
Llama,
blonde,

998
00:57:04.750 --> 00:57:06.310
all of this shit.
And just meanwhile,

999
00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:10.690
all of that pales in comparison to,
you know,
if,

1000
00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:12.670
if this fucking places in here,

1001
00:57:12.671 --> 00:57:14.590
you're not going to have to worry about any of that.
Right.

1002
00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:17.530
That's why I think that the cell phones are super destructive.

1003
00:57:17.590 --> 00:57:22.120
Like because they are making everything about me,
me,
me,
look what I'm doing,

1004
00:57:22.210 --> 00:57:25.180
look like where I am,
look what I'm eating.
It's,
and,

1005
00:57:25.330 --> 00:57:30.070
and were on it constantly.
And it's like,
well the Jesse Chris Delea you follow?

1006
00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:34.060
Did you see his thing that he did the uh,
the unfollowing no.
Oh my God.

1007
00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:35.830
It's one of my favorite things ever.

1008
00:57:35.831 --> 00:57:40.090
He's talking about just making fun of Instagram models.

1009
00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:43.420
Uh,
I mean,
I can do it.

1010
00:57:43.421 --> 00:57:46.090
I don't feel like I'm doing this joke because he put it out there.
He goes,
look,

1011
00:57:46.091 --> 00:57:49.840
he goes,
if you're on Instagram,
it goes in your posts and stuff.

1012
00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:53.890
You've just taken a picture of your booty and your titties.
He goes,

1013
00:57:53.891 --> 00:57:58.670
make no mistake.
You Hook hooking.
And he just starts calling them hookers and,

1014
00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:01.420
and you know,
and then he just starts really like something.

1015
00:58:01.421 --> 00:58:03.120
Some of these people I didn't even know fucking exists.

1016
00:58:03.210 --> 00:58:04.930
And I guess this is thing that pretty girls still,

1017
00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:08.460
when they bite into a sandwich and they kind of look up like that saying like,

1018
00:58:08.810 --> 00:58:12.010
yeah,
yeah I'm going to start this thing called the unfollowing.

1019
00:58:12.730 --> 00:58:17.730
And what I love about it is first of all I'm seeing him turning the corner as a

1020
00:58:17.741 --> 00:58:18.940
comedian because he was always just,

1021
00:58:18.941 --> 00:58:22.810
he just had that this guy is a club like a fucking closer,
you know,

1022
00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:26.960
and now he's getting,
he's like fine in his like,

1023
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:32.170
like this razor because he was always kind of fun and energetic and stuff and,

1024
00:58:32.771 --> 00:58:36.260
but now it's,
it's like,
it's like it's becoming this,

1025
00:58:36.550 --> 00:58:38.830
you seeing this force going in this direction.

1026
00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:43.090
Like I was fucking cry and laugh for like I'm not afraid to do things along

1027
00:58:43.091 --> 00:58:46.870
those lines make me laugh and it's just really fucking was making me laugh.

1028
00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:52.260
But the funniest thing about that is that would really bother somebody like

1029
00:58:53.291 --> 00:58:56.200
that.
Like cause cause they're living,

1030
00:58:56.530 --> 00:58:59.410
not that I would want to hurt those people cause it's very easy to hate

1031
00:58:59.411 --> 00:59:02.140
beautiful people.
You know what I mean?
It's just,
it's,

1032
00:59:02.290 --> 00:59:05.290
they're very hateable as you're staring at them because you hate yourself.
Like,

1033
00:59:05.291 --> 00:59:10.250
why am I this fucking just with like this beauty in all of this stuff.
Like,

1034
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:11.560
like,
look at that.
You've got like,

1035
00:59:12.010 --> 00:59:16.270
I got to fucking do nine hours of fucking specials to get half as many followers

1036
00:59:16.271 --> 00:59:19.690
as you do because you were a fucking half shirt,
you know?
So I just,

1037
00:59:19.691 --> 00:59:23.020
there was just something funny,
just finally see a,

1038
00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:27.650
a movement to make their numbers go down.
I don't know.

1039
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:29.120
The more I'm saying this out loud,

1040
00:59:29.121 --> 00:59:32.450
I'm actually realizing that it's kind of says more about me than about those

1041
00:59:32.451 --> 00:59:35.680
people that take those pictures.
But I don't know.
I just thought it was at,

1042
00:59:36.770 --> 00:59:40.280
that shit is funny.
So I'm actually watching that girl at the gas station.

1043
00:59:40.281 --> 00:59:43.610
I'm going to try to take,
uh,
uh,
like this morning I didn't have my phone,

1044
00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:46.040
you know,
when I spent the entire,

1045
00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:49.700
like two and a half hours ahead with my daughter this morning,
chased her around,

1046
00:59:49.701 --> 00:59:52.820
we play with the puzzles,
I read the books.
Uh,

1047
00:59:52.850 --> 00:59:57.620
what else did we do was teach her how to play catch and uh,

1048
00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:59.960
I think she's going to throw at the left hand,
which would be really cool,

1049
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.890
although she's really big.

1050
01:00:00.891 --> 01:00:04.070
But the Darryl Dawkins over the top sort of two handed slam,

1051
01:00:04.071 --> 01:00:05.180
I know you're not going to know that reference.

1052
01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:08.300
He played for the 76 years before you were born.
Um,

1053
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:12.290
so I'm trying to get her not to,
uh,

1054
01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:15.500
be into stuff like that.
But the weird thing is,

1055
01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:18.320
is because they're so hyper with their energy and all you want to do is just

1056
01:00:18.321 --> 01:00:19.154
hold them and hug them.

1057
01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:23.720
The best way to do that is if you put on their favorite cartoon and then they

1058
01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.730
just totally snuggle up next to you,

1059
01:00:26.060 --> 01:00:29.850
but then there's no interaction other than the physical because then you just

1060
01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:33.920
literally say saying like,
Hey,
hey,
hey,
he like,
give me a kiss,
give me kiss.

1061
01:00:33.921 --> 01:00:37.640
And they'll go like,
we'll just sort of lean into you and not even look at you,

1062
01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:42.260
just give you the chicken.
They just sorta lasered into that.
And I'm like,
uh,

1063
01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:46.550
I dunno.
I Dunno.
I watched a lot of TV.

1064
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:51.670
I did all right in life.
The fuck are you going to do?
So to watch TV and,

1065
01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:55.310
and look at your fucking talented you are.
And I'm up there just screaming,

1066
01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:59.740
yelling like a lunatic.
Um,
where can people get this album?
Um,
anyway.
Yeah.

1067
01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:04.640
Listen to music.
Um,
can they download it on iTunes?
Yeah.
Spotify.

1068
01:01:09.130 --> 01:01:13.760
I don't think it's true to things going to be said on this podcast than that.

1069
01:01:13.761 --> 01:01:14.001
Yeah.

1070
01:01:14.001 --> 01:01:18.320
I can't because my fucking computers filled up and I forget my password all the

1071
01:01:18.321 --> 01:01:20.630
time.
Well,
I just want to,
uh,

1072
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:25.160
congratulate you because I know you worked so hard on this jet,
just assembling,

1073
01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.600
abandon,
all of that type of stuff.

1074
01:01:26.601 --> 01:01:28.550
Like there's so much more work to this where I just like,

1075
01:01:28.551 --> 01:01:29.720
I need to know or to new hour,

1076
01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:33.080
I don't have to find a Mike stand guy and all of this shit.

1077
01:01:33.081 --> 01:01:36.740
I just have to go out and just go do it.
But,
um,
uh,
whatever you did,

1078
01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.830
the three songs that I listened to,
I mean,
it is just,

1079
01:01:40.310 --> 01:01:44.330
it's on such a high level creativity and everything.

1080
01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:47.400
Um,
I'm,
I'm really happy for you and,
uh,

1081
01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:50.920
everybody watching listening cause they're always gonna be some clips of this on

1082
01:01:51.010 --> 01:01:55.970
video.
Please download and it is called love Romaine.
Love remains.

1083
01:01:56.050 --> 01:01:59.900
All right.
Thank you for coming on.
I was going to ask you,
um,

1084
01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:05.140
how do you stop doing ums and uhs and you knows and shit like that.

1085
01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:09.860
How do I,
yeah,
no I don't.
I do it all the time.
All the time.
Why?

1086
01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:13.000
Because I get something that,
cause you do it.
I do it so much.
Oh,

1087
01:02:13.001 --> 01:02:17.180
I do it to how you do and you're in care now I didn't know if I don't give a

1088
01:02:17.181 --> 01:02:21.240
fuck.
He,
you listen to a
Keith Richards,

1089
01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:24.510
ca Jag.
People can't understand him.
He doesn't give a shit.

1090
01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.730
But like what about when you're doing material?

1091
01:02:27.030 --> 01:02:29.410
I guess because you've written the material that's going to be less of that

1092
01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:31.620
because you know what you're about to say as opposed to if you're just doing a

1093
01:02:31.621 --> 01:02:34.980
podcast.
If I was to actually try to work on something like that,

1094
01:02:34.981 --> 01:02:38.220
then I would be up here,
which is not where I want to like yeah,
I want to be,

1095
01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:43.980
it's just calming down the rain spout and out my fucking be like considered

1096
01:02:43.981 --> 01:02:47.730
technique for a comedian to like at some point work on that.

1097
01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:51.510
Yes it would.
Whereas like with like,
um,

1098
01:02:52.830 --> 01:02:57.690
I learned,
I started,
uh,
taken from lessons from Dee Dee village,
um,

1099
01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:01.200
how many,
like how much you know,

1100
01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:07.010
of the way I was playing was getting in the way of me getting to where I wanted

1101
01:03:07.441 --> 01:03:10.470
to be with whatever,
because my,
my technique,

1102
01:03:10.471 --> 01:03:14.040
I was like sitting like this and I was grabbing the sticks like that was getting

1103
01:03:14.041 --> 01:03:16.220
blisters and,
and uh,

1104
01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:21.320
like I wasn't making gravity at anything that had to do with physics work for

1105
01:03:21.481 --> 01:03:21.900
me.

1106
01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:26.790
So I was literally fighting the drum kit and then he taught me all of this

1107
01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:30.210
stuff.
I haven't seen him in a couple of months and I'm going back to my bad old

1108
01:03:30.211 --> 01:03:31.340
habits.
But,
um,

1109
01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:37.080
there is that thing I think that like,
uh,
well we'll say with like a musician,

1110
01:03:37.110 --> 01:03:39.510
it's like I don't want to learn how to read man.
I just want to,
you know,

1111
01:03:39.511 --> 01:03:43.290
I just want to fucking be this,
you know,
free fucking thing.
Right.

1112
01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:47.850
And just there is merit in that because you do have those people who only can

1113
01:03:47.851 --> 01:03:49.650
play if there's sheet music in front of them,

1114
01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:55.370
but if you can somehow marry both of those where you actually have technique but

1115
01:03:55.381 --> 01:03:57.990
you can still play from here and not be up there.

1116
01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:03.590
I think that that's like the promised land and I always kind of felt is a

1117
01:04:03.691 --> 01:04:04.291
comedian.

1118
01:04:04.291 --> 01:04:09.291
If you could somehow combine Richard Pryor that's specially did live in concert

1119
01:04:09.931 --> 01:04:14.130
on long beach,
if you could combine that with George Carlin,

1120
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:18.270
um,
where his stuff was just like,
I feel like he,

1121
01:04:18.271 --> 01:04:22.920
he knew every fucking word that he was going to say and it was like,

1122
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:28.380
yes,
like pop up,
up,
up,
up,
up,
up.
The whole time where prior,

1123
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:32.220
you know,
on that special came walking out,
it was like a hell Gig.

1124
01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:36.570
There was people walking around and shit and he just started making fun of

1125
01:04:36.571 --> 01:04:41.160
people.
And I think the way he was wired that helped him,

1126
01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:45.210
that helped him better than if everyone was just sitting there staring at him

1127
01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:48.660
like,
okay,
begin your,
your standup special.

1128
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:53.260
I think that he came out and you know,
sit yo ass down,
you know,
sit,

1129
01:04:53.261 --> 01:04:55.860
you'll fucking ugliest out what all that stuff that he was saying.

1130
01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:59.910
And everyone was just walking around and he's riffing and then he just just got

1131
01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:01.980
in a zone.
And

1132
01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:05.940
what's amazing is you begin to his own,

1133
01:05:05.941 --> 01:05:09.780
usually that lasts for like six minutes because what happens up to six minutes

1134
01:05:09.990 --> 01:05:13.230
of that is you're like,
you start worrying going,

1135
01:05:13.231 --> 01:05:15.870
well what happens when this ends and I have to go into my act,

1136
01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:19.670
I'm going to be fucked.
And you,

1137
01:05:19.850 --> 01:05:22.570
you can't think that because it's almost like when you haven't tried like

1138
01:05:22.571 --> 01:05:23.780
meditating.
Yeah.

1139
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:26.590
So you know like when you start to feel like you're floating and like leaving

1140
01:05:26.591 --> 01:05:29.520
your body,
if you start thinking,
oh my God,
this is great,
I'm leaving.

1141
01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:31.660
And then you'll wash and just go right back down.

1142
01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:35.710
So that's the same way with like,
like catching his own.

1143
01:05:35.711 --> 01:05:39.460
So like what I've learned a little,
I know about technique with like drums,

1144
01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:45.040
he should just practice a little bit every day and then when it starts to become

1145
01:05:45.041 --> 01:05:49.690
this thing you don't have to think about then all those skills you learned about

1146
01:05:49.691 --> 01:05:53.440
sort of leaving your body and just like,
just like,
I mean your body's there,

1147
01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:54.130
but you're,

1148
01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:57.490
you're listening to what you're playing that's making you do that next thing.

1149
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:59.290
If you can exist,

1150
01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:02.530
you can go back there with all this technique now he not going to get hurt,

1151
01:06:02.531 --> 01:06:06.280
you're not going to get tired.
Um,
Emmy eventually will.
But like,
um,

1152
01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:11.410
so I think what the comedian,
if,
if I was to try to do that,
like,
okay,

1153
01:06:11.411 --> 01:06:13.750
maybe I won't curse as much or something like that.
Like I,

1154
01:06:13.751 --> 01:06:17.620
that would definitely be a few steps backwards.
Um,

1155
01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:22.450
by that man,
maybe it would help me.
I don't know.
I don't,

1156
01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:26.950
I honestly don't think,
I don't think.
Okay.

1157
01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:30.730
Cause if I go up there and I start doing that,
it's all about not being here.

1158
01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:34.980
Um,
I mean I sell it.
I'm obviously thinking like,
okay,
I'm going to,

1159
01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:41.290
it's more like,
okay,
you
like I just walk out,
I just start talking.

1160
01:06:41.291 --> 01:06:45.040
And then this Joe comes out and then I said this joke,
which made me think,

1161
01:06:45.041 --> 01:06:47.140
oh yeah,
I have this joke and look at this fucking guy.

1162
01:06:47.890 --> 01:06:50.830
And then it just sorta just,
oh now we're over here and just you just,

1163
01:06:51.450 --> 01:06:53.500
but do you have like a set list of jokes?

1164
01:06:53.530 --> 01:06:56.890
Like you want to do it in this order or this order?
Yeah,

1165
01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:01.410
but that is all out the fucking window.
The second I go up there and sell,

1166
01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:05.800
some nights it goes like that.
And then other nights,

1167
01:07:05.940 --> 01:07:08.110
like I definitely have like sections,
but this,

1168
01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:12.130
some nights I just go out there and all of a sudden I tell the last choke first

1169
01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:14.350
and I'm switching everything around.

1170
01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:17.200
And then the guy I told her with is this like,
you know,

1171
01:07:17.201 --> 01:07:20.080
waiting to go on stage going like,
dude,
I didn't know what the fuck was going on.

1172
01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:22.360
Oh,
you did,
you close a bit in the middle.
I was like,
wait,

1173
01:07:22.361 --> 01:07:25.930
he's only doing 35 minutes.
And then you went on,
you did like another,
you know,

1174
01:07:26.290 --> 01:07:29.650
whatever,
another 25 after that or something.
Um,

1175
01:07:30.820 --> 01:07:35.230
I have like the main set list,
you know,

1176
01:07:35.231 --> 01:07:39.670
so that's the,
you know,
this is the plan,
the general fucking plan.

1177
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:43.480
And then you go out there and shit happens.
You're in a weird mood.

1178
01:07:43.481 --> 01:07:46.780
Somebody says something is you look at something in the back of the room that

1179
01:07:46.781 --> 01:07:50.590
makes you think of something and then it go,
it goes in that direction.

1180
01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.150
And um,

1181
01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:57.360
and I am a full believer of doing that because then it doesn't become this grind

1182
01:07:58.060 --> 01:07:59.050
cause I used to,
I used to have,

1183
01:07:59.051 --> 01:08:02.320
I start with this and then that leads to this and I have my segways and blah

1184
01:08:02.321 --> 01:08:06.700
blah blah blah blah.
And it just became like,
you know,
it's rigid.
Yeah.

1185
01:08:06.701 --> 01:08:11.140
And then I would be on stage and my mouth would be talking and I would find

1186
01:08:11.141 --> 01:08:12.760
myself thinking about going like,

1187
01:08:13.030 --> 01:08:17.570
well the second show if the or lets me not close it out,

1188
01:08:17.571 --> 01:08:20.930
I could probably be home by,
and then I was just saying yeah.

1189
01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:23.180
And then I was just like,
wait,
I'm talking right now.

1190
01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:26.570
And people laughing and I'm thinking about other shit.

1191
01:08:26.571 --> 01:08:31.400
What the fuck am I doing right now?
And um,
I it,
uh,
it's weird.

1192
01:08:31.401 --> 01:08:36.080
I learned how to free myself up through y more through watching musicians.

1193
01:08:36.650 --> 01:08:38.910
I've always equated it to music because that's something that I,

1194
01:08:38.911 --> 01:08:41.570
I sort of started with.
So I always thought,

1195
01:08:41.571 --> 01:08:46.010
I remember talking to a long time ago,
late great Patrice O'Neil.
And I said,

1196
01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:48.140
I was telling him,
I was like,
you know,

1197
01:08:48.141 --> 01:08:49.800
I always wished I could see somebody cause I,

1198
01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:52.700
you couldn't gauge how good you were.
You know,

1199
01:08:52.940 --> 01:08:56.210
you can't see how good you are or how much you're improving because you're,
you,

1200
01:08:56.780 --> 01:09:01.250
you know what I mean?
You're just in there.
So I always said,
I always wanted this.

1201
01:09:01.251 --> 01:09:06.020
I wish I could just have somebody sit down and play guitar at the level of comic

1202
01:09:06.021 --> 01:09:08.900
that I am right now.
It's like,
could they change chords?

1203
01:09:09.410 --> 01:09:12.470
Could they play without looking?
Could they solo?

1204
01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:15.890
Like where am I on that trajectory?

1205
01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:20.080
And it's one of the few times he didn't give me any shit.
He was just like,
hi.

1206
01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:21.290
He goes,
that's actually interesting.

1207
01:09:23.090 --> 01:09:26.420
Then probably I reacted to that and then he probably trashed me cause he

1208
01:09:26.421 --> 01:09:27.770
actually opened up for half a second.

1209
01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:32.870
So yeah.
Fascinating.

1210
01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:36.110
Fascinating nuts and bolts of how to tell Dick and shit.

1211
01:09:36.111 --> 01:09:40.160
Jokes will continue after these messages from stamps.com

1212
01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:44.450
<v 3>all right.
Oh baby boot boat me on days beyond Ds.</v>

1213
01:09:45.350 --> 01:09:49.930
All red faces in fucking Iceland.
Doodoo Doodoo me on days be on days.

1214
01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:55.100
He's eating fucking frozen bison and he's not going to pee his underwears cause

1215
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:59.660
they made out of soft Mick a modal modal.

1216
01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:04.310
So who fucking cares me undies?
There are two types of dudes in the world.

1217
01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:07.460
Those that go through the gate and those that go over the fence.

1218
01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:11.270
Well after years of research and countless experiments with seasoned underwear

1219
01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:12.793
scientists,

1220
01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:18.060
Mandy's now has an option for both with their new boxer briefs with the fly.

1221
01:10:19.190 --> 01:10:20.150
It took a while,

1222
01:10:20.330 --> 01:10:24.620
but now men on both sides of the aisle enjoy the world's softest undies.

1223
01:10:24.830 --> 01:10:28.610
Not only will you feel like your loins are being hugged by joy itself,

1224
01:10:28.611 --> 01:10:32.810
but me undies gives you multiple style options for men and women men can wear.

1225
01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:36.980
Can now try the new boxer brief with a fly.
It's the same.
Great.

1226
01:10:36.981 --> 01:10:41.840
Cut His boxer briefs just a whole.
Now for number one.

1227
01:10:41.870 --> 01:10:42.703
Okay.

1228
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:47.540
Meanders is also the Goto for the softest long where on the planet hang out and

1229
01:10:47.670 --> 01:10:48.800
they're Super Cup.
Well,

1230
01:10:48.801 --> 01:10:51.350
you're going to hang out with that hole in your underwears hang out in.

1231
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:54.320
They're super comfy lounge pants in onesies.

1321
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:24.180
April 25th,
2011.

1322
01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:29.400
How the fuck are you?
Yeah.
Well that's good.

1323
01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.700
Uh,
I'm in a good mood here.
I just did the levels this week.

1324
01:17:32.701 --> 01:17:36.710
Let me know how you guys have,
uh,
if this is too loud because some truckers,

1325
01:17:36.711 --> 01:17:40.260
some truckers,
some truckers wrote me in,
hey man,

1326
01:17:40.261 --> 01:17:43.530
I'm driving across this fucking country.
Bring in Bacon and beard.

1327
01:17:43.531 --> 01:17:46.770
All these fat fucks out here.
And when my,
when my,

1328
01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:51.060
when my roommate gets a rumbling,
I can't hear your podcast.
They are,
come on.

1329
01:17:51.061 --> 01:17:54.000
Good Buddy.
Can you turn it up for me?

1330
01:17:55.340 --> 01:17:59.250
You've got your ears on what?
That whole fucking phenomenon back in the 70s,

1331
01:17:59.251 --> 01:18:04.140
you guys old enough to remember that Shit when having a CB and being a fucking

1332
01:18:04.141 --> 01:18:06.930
redneck trucker was actually in for half a second.

1333
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:11.490
And I'm not talking about that Ashton Kutcher horse shit when he walked around

1334
01:18:11.491 --> 01:18:16.410
with this fucking greasy trucker hat right before he started banging that

1335
01:18:16.411 --> 01:18:20.550
fucking hot mom up there in Wyoming with their big fake fucking tits.

1336
01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:25.080
I'm not talking about that.
His trucker hat that actually said von Dutch on it.

1337
01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:27.810
Did you guys even know what the fuck that was?
I didn't tell him.

1338
01:18:27.811 --> 01:18:31.020
Moved out to La and realized that that was the guy who did all the custom paint

1339
01:18:31.021 --> 01:18:31.950
on the hot rods.

1340
01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:37.560
Isn't that what the fuck it was I'm talking about before that talking about
when,

1341
01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:42.800
when there was shows on TV with guys who hung out with monkeys and it was Clint

1342
01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:46.260
Eastwood was making movies with monkeys.
Like that was like,

1343
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:51.210
those were like the vampire movies
of the late seventies.

1344
01:18:51.810 --> 01:18:55.410
He had any which way but loose any which way you can.

1345
01:18:57.090 --> 01:18:59.700
Uh,
why the fuck am I doing a trilogy with an Orangutan,

1346
01:18:59.701 --> 01:19:03.630
I think was the last one that he did.
And they even had a TV show.

1347
01:19:03.690 --> 01:19:08.690
It's my voice cracks in a TV show called a Bj and the bear.

1348
01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:12.140
And the bear was a,

1349
01:19:12.150 --> 01:19:16.830
had a hat on like Paul Bear Bryant who was the old coach or the fucking Alabama

1350
01:19:16.831 --> 01:19:21.360
Crimson tide.
And I didn't get that,
you know,
cause what,
what,

1351
01:19:21.361 --> 01:19:25.080
what were they saying about him?
You know,
they're calling him a monkey.

1352
01:19:25.081 --> 01:19:28.170
Is that racist to call a white man a monkey?

1353
01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:33.150
Oh Gee.
Sheesh.
Um,
this is the podcast for this week,
ladies and gentlemen.

1354
01:19:33.151 --> 01:19:36.630
So this is,
this is going to be the levels.
I adjusted the base.
Somebody said the,

1355
01:19:36.631 --> 01:19:39.990
the base was too fucking low.
Like I have all these buttons on these,

1356
01:19:40.170 --> 01:19:41.640
on these goddamn thing.
I don't know how to work it.

1357
01:19:41.641 --> 01:19:45.720
So I just realized that there's a high,
a mid and a low range.
So gradually,

1358
01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:50.490
eventually this podcast will become professional.
Look at me.

1359
01:19:50.491 --> 01:19:54.810
I'm pacing around.
I'm pacing around my old fucking bedroom.

1360
01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:58.980
That's what I'm doing here on Easter.
Fucking Easter Sunday.

1361
01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:03.950

1365
01:20:15.300 --> 01:20:16.230
Is that what you guys did?

1366
01:20:16.231 --> 01:20:20.760
Did you give you a little colored eggs for the fucking weed smokers?

1367
01:20:20.761 --> 01:20:23.640

1370
01:20:30.970 --> 01:20:33.700
remember back in the day when you get into a fight with somebody and you knew

1371
01:20:33.701 --> 01:20:34.451
you were going to lose.

1372
01:20:34.451 --> 01:20:38.000
So you just had that first spastic eight seconds of the fight where you like

1373
01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:39.630
<v 6>woo</v>

1374
01:20:39.630 --> 01:20:42.960
<v 3>just swinging before he just started punching in the head and you started crying</v>

1375
01:20:43.250 --> 01:20:46.590
and then the girl you had a crush on,
that's the first person when you looked up,

1376
01:20:46.591 --> 01:20:50.430
that's the one you always saw the dirt and the side of your face in the fucking

1377
01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:53.430
pebble stuck in your skin and you just,
she just,
you know,

1378
01:20:53.431 --> 01:20:56.850
you don't know what kills you is she didn't look away.
She was walking away,

1379
01:20:56.851 --> 01:21:00.780
but she was making eye contact and she didn't know what she was thinking because

1380
01:21:00.781 --> 01:21:02.280
she was so young.
But it was just,

1381
01:21:02.281 --> 01:21:06.090
her inner DNA was clicking in already.

1382
01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:07.830
That was just letting her know,

1383
01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:11.040
was just giving her innocent little stay away from that.
You know,

1384
01:21:11.041 --> 01:21:15.570
when she gets older it gets more sophisticated with,
you cannot breed with that

1385
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:22.680
when you're young.
It's just sort of,
he looks icky.
Um,

1386
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:28.050
anyways,
the fuck was I talking about.
I'm talking about truckers.
Let's,

1387
01:21:28.051 --> 01:21:32.750
let's work our way back here.
Bj and Mackay,
B j Mckay Yan,

1388
01:21:32.880 --> 01:21:35.610
his best friend bear.
Is there any truckers listen to this shit?

1389
01:21:35.611 --> 01:21:39.150
And that's why you became a trucker.
You know,
you'll flunk in math,

1390
01:21:39.930 --> 01:21:42.090
you're sucked in English class history didn't interest you.

1391
01:21:42.091 --> 01:21:43.410
And then one day there was a show,

1392
01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:46.770
they'll let you know that your dream of someday driving a truck with a

1393
01:21:46.771 --> 01:21:50.790
chimpanzee could come true.
You're like,
dude,
this is what the fuck I'm gonna do

1394
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:55.650
<v 6>speaking it did.
Um,</v>

1395
01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:59.020
I've mentioned this week that I was going to have a couple of guests on the

1396
01:21:59.021 --> 01:22:02.680
Monday morning podcast.
Not One guest that to guests,

1397
01:22:03.100 --> 01:22:07.300
but two guests,
sorry.
It's gotta be three,
right?
You always got to say,
not this,

1398
01:22:07.330 --> 01:22:11.320
not this,
but this.
Which is a hard thing to do when the numbers too,

1399
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:14.190
but I plowed through it.
I'm going to have two guests and um,

1400
01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:18.380
I was thinking of doing it on this podcast and I was like,
you know what?
Well,

1401
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:20.320
why don't I do two podcasts this week?

1402
01:22:20.890 --> 01:22:24.910
Why don't I overindulge like all the kids running around with their fucking

1403
01:22:24.911 --> 01:22:25.744
candy,

1404
01:22:26.290 --> 01:22:30.130
not really learning the story of Jesus is in this store.

1405
01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:34.450
This is the day about the conquering of life.
Over death.
Right?

1406
01:22:34.570 --> 01:22:39.190
I read a little bit,
everybody was thinking Jesus was dead.
They were like,

1407
01:22:39.191 --> 01:22:44.020
I can't believe it.
He was the number one draft pick.
Dude.

1408
01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:47.990
We was supposed to get the championship or what does he do?

1409
01:22:47.991 --> 01:22:51.220
We fucking shits the bed on Friday.
Where is he?

1410
01:22:52.330 --> 01:22:55.060
Where the fuck is he last?

1411
01:22:55.090 --> 01:22:59.440
I already was in a cave hiding by a rock.
He's fucking dead.
His career's over.

1412
01:22:59.770 --> 01:23:02.740
It's it.
We need them.
We need to go to another motivational speaker.

1413
01:23:02.741 --> 01:23:06.190
And then what happens?
All of a sudden,
some nosy prek

1414
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:10.210
<v 3>walked in,
right?
Started rolling the rock back.</v>

1415
01:23:10.211 --> 01:23:14.720
Probably the original Geraldo Rivera.
You know what's,

1416
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:18.670
I'm just fucking amazing.
Medieval mustache.

1417
01:23:18.671 --> 01:23:22.330
And he came walking in there and Jesus was just laying there,
right?

1418
01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:26.890
If I can overuse this reference for the 500th time and two weeks lay in there

1419
01:23:26.891 --> 01:23:30.970
like,
fucking Burt Reynolds got that leaf over his cock.

1420
01:23:31.690 --> 01:23:35.430
Why do I talk about that so much?
Do I have a crush on Burt Reynolds?
Odu,

1421
01:23:35.450 --> 01:23:39.940
a fucking queer,
uh,
sorry and adjusted like there.

1422
01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:42.850
Um,
now it's just fucking,
it's just hilarious to me.

1423
01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:47.430
I love the seventies I love what you could get away with,
you know?
So anyways,

1424
01:23:47.431 --> 01:23:52.431
so Jesus is laying there right in his playgirl fucking spread his hippie hair

1425
01:23:52.901 --> 01:23:55.840
laying down,
you know?
And then,

1426
01:23:55.841 --> 01:23:57.970
let me see if I can remember this from church and then these,

1427
01:23:57.971 --> 01:24:01.900
like there was like at least three guys came walking in and they were the guys

1428
01:24:01.901 --> 01:24:06.901
who hung out with him and his last supper right before Judas betrayed him.

1429
01:24:09.230 --> 01:24:12.860
Do you know Jesus?
Nah,
dude,
I don't know that motherfucker.

1430
01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.450
What do you think he's going to say?

1431
01:24:14.451 --> 01:24:16.940
You just nailed them to a fucking piece of wood.

1432
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:21.620
Give a fuck who it is up on that.
I don't know that guy.
Yeah.
Good for you.

1433
01:24:21.621 --> 01:24:25.580
Where'd it go?
Jesus.
Let's get the fuck Outta here.
I really think,

1434
01:24:25.581 --> 01:24:27.410
I think Judas gets a bad rep.

1435
01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:34.550
Look,
I think you should always stick by your friends.
But Jesus Christ,

1436
01:24:34.551 --> 01:24:38.390
what the fuck he supposed to do?
And then it's over.
You know?

1437
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:42.110
Do you realize the nerve damage you're going to get if somebody drives the
nails?

1438
01:24:42.230 --> 01:24:45.170
And I've heard different things through the hands of,
through the forearms.

1439
01:24:45.670 --> 01:24:47.710
You know,
ran between the radius and Ulna,

1440
01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:50.660
the fucking nerve damage you're going to get at that point,
right?

1441
01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:54.110
That you're not,
you're not coming back from that.

1442
01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:57.320
He can't continue being a carpenter.
But wait a minute,
he says,
son of God,

1443
01:24:58.100 --> 01:25:00.680
why didn't he just,
just,
you know,

1444
01:25:00.710 --> 01:25:04.880
hover off that thing and may in just go heal and then he was better.

1445
01:25:04.881 --> 01:25:08.060
Why didn't he do that?
You know why I didn't do that?

1446
01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:11.360
Because then he couldn't guilt shift for your entire life.
Look at me.

1447
01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:14.990
Look what I did.
Happy Easter.
Everybody.

1448
01:25:16.370 --> 01:25:20.210
So anyways,
they fucking,
uh,
so yes.
So the guy dies,
right?

1449
01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:23.750
He dies and uh,
everybody's like,
Oh God,
what do we do?

1450
01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:28.790
Then it started raining really bad and then Steve Carell put a bunch of animals

1451
01:25:28.791 --> 01:25:33.440
on a boat,
right?
He saved them.
No wait.

1452
01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:36.260
Then those three guys would find them in the cave would have been dead because

1453
01:25:36.261 --> 01:25:39.110
they weren't on the boat.
All right,
let's back up.

1454
01:25:40.690 --> 01:25:45.690
Let's back up to 12 a s that no bs before Steve,

1455
01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:52.600
before Steve Carell.
Beast BSC.
Alright,

1456
01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:53.980
what the fuck am I?

1457
01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:58.360
Three fucking guys walk into the damn cave and then they go a,
Hey,

1458
01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:04.850
are you sleeping?
Are you awake?
And Jesus,
Nah,
I'm up.
Yeah.
Like you're not Jesus.

1459
01:26:04.851 --> 01:26:08.720
We saw you.
You died.
And I go,
it is me.
And then,

1460
01:26:08.890 --> 01:26:12.740
and then they didn't believe it was him and then they were in trouble,
you know?

1461
01:26:12.741 --> 01:26:15.230
Then they would sit next to Judas at the fucking bench,

1462
01:26:15.231 --> 01:26:18.080
outside the principal's office,
waiting to go in and see,
God.

1463
01:26:18.830 --> 01:26:22.280
Why did you say he didn't know my son?
You know,
my son.
You've been over my house.

1464
01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:26.720
What is your story?
Judas,
why did you deny him?
Hey listen man,
you know,

1465
01:26:26.830 --> 01:26:30.580
I didn't want any trouble.
The guy was,
you know,
I was coming to get you that,

1466
01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:33.430
that you know,
Judas is basically that fucking guy.
Yeah.

1467
01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:36.350
It was at Bobby and Saturday night fever.

1468
01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:40.490
Remember that shit when he drove away and he didn't fight.
That's who Judases.

1469
01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:46.040
Um,
is he built?
Yeah,
I think he is.
According to my version,

1470
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:51.140
my new version of,
of the Old Testament.
Is this the Old Testament or the new?

1471
01:26:51.141 --> 01:26:54.590
The new one,
whatever.
So these fucking guys walk in and then,
uh,

1472
01:26:54.770 --> 01:26:58.370
basically how they figure out it's Jesus is he takes one of their hands and he

1473
01:26:58.371 --> 01:27:02.840
puts it into the wound on the side of him and then they go,
oh yeah,

1474
01:27:02.841 --> 01:27:03.674
it is you.

1475
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:07.850
It was weird because I hung out with you and I know what your face looks like,

1476
01:27:07.851 --> 01:27:11.360
but unless I stuck my hand inside your fucking chest cavity,

1477
01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:16.190
I wasn't really convinced.
Wait a minute.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Feel that liver.

1478
01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:20.840
Tell me that's not Jesus.
That's him.
That's fucking him.
So,
uh,
yeah,

1479
01:27:20.841 --> 01:27:23.350
that's the history of our,
the Jesus part of it.
Through it.

1480
01:27:23.351 --> 01:27:26.000
It is hot as fuck in this room.
I'm in my old department.

1481
01:27:26.001 --> 01:27:29.070
I have to have the doors closed.
Oh,
so anyways,
yeah.

1482
01:27:29.071 --> 01:27:31.160
So I decided I was going to do two podcasts this week.

1483
01:27:31.161 --> 01:27:32.180
I'm going to do the regular one,

1484
01:27:32.181 --> 01:27:35.600
the regular one where I ramble and I piss off fucking Jesus freaks and talk to

1485
01:27:36.170 --> 01:27:38.210
truckers,
talking to truckers.

1486
01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:44.840
What do you guys do on your trucks?
You got the confederate flags,
Diego Ye high.

1487
01:27:44.850 --> 01:27:47.870
When you change lanes and you know,
you're like,

1488
01:27:48.010 --> 01:27:49.910
you're like one point when liberals do shit like that.

1489
01:27:49.911 --> 01:27:54.290
That's one thing I've noticed about liberals there as fucked up to the left as

1490
01:27:54.291 --> 01:27:59.030
the people all the way on the right,
you know,
there is intolerant and all.

1491
01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:03.050
Am I preaching Jesus?
It's hot in here.
This isn't me.
I don't preach,

1492
01:28:03.680 --> 01:28:06.380
do I Dow?
Um,

1493
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:11.320
I'm just trying to get my bearings here.
People the fuck was I talking?
Oh,

1494
01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:15.890
and then he got the Easter bunny.
All right.
And according to Wikipedia,

1495
01:28:15.891 --> 01:28:18.650
the Easter bunny came from Germany,
you know,

1496
01:28:18.770 --> 01:28:21.920
so all you people out there think Germans are the most evil motherfuckers on the

1497
01:28:21.921 --> 01:28:22.341
planet.

1498
01:28:22.341 --> 01:28:25.940
Just cause they started two world wars and tried to wipe an entire group of

1499
01:28:25.941 --> 01:28:30.350
people off the face of the earth by sticking them in ovens,
you know?

1500
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:35.390
Yeah.
All right,
you got him there.
A little evil there,
but you know what?

1501
01:28:35.391 --> 01:28:36.770
They got a soft side.

1502
01:28:38.850 --> 01:28:41.570
They got his soft side and his name is Peter Cottontail,
right?

1503
01:28:41.571 --> 01:28:43.670
Here comes Peter cottontail,

1504
01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:49.120
<v 6>up and down the bunny trail,
hip.
Any happen?
He fuck you,</v>

1505
01:28:49.150 --> 01:28:52.180
motherfucker.
Right?
One of the few Easter songs I ever knew.

1506
01:28:52.420 --> 01:28:55.730
He's got jelly beans for Bobby colored eggs for six

1507
01:28:55.870 --> 01:28:58.360
<v 3>pursue.
Um,
so anyways,</v>

1508
01:28:58.361 --> 01:29:02.040
I guess they brought that tradition over here and people have asked the

1509
01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.150
<v 6>Seinfeldian question,
why do they have earnings coming into the room?</v>

1510
01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:10.710
Because evidently,
uh,
there was a sign of fertility,

1511
01:29:10.980 --> 01:29:14.460
I guess according to Wikipedia,
basically birds,
you know,

1512
01:29:14.461 --> 01:29:19.461
they lay a bunch of eggs very fertile and bunny rabbits when they,

1513
01:29:19.950 --> 01:29:23.100
uh,
when they get fucking knocked up,
right?

1514
01:29:23.101 --> 01:29:27.450
When some fucking hair starts pulling the back of their ears as he's fucking

1515
01:29:27.451 --> 01:29:31.920
Jack Hammering in the back of that little rabbit pussy,
what comes out,
right?

1516
01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:34.680
Like fucking 48 Ravitz every God damn time.

1517
01:29:36.150 --> 01:29:40.720
That's why snakes is so fat that just,
that just not the,
this,

1518
01:29:41.490 --> 01:29:45.030
there's just plenty of rabbits to f to feast on.
Right.

1519
01:29:46.110 --> 01:29:46.950
I don't fucking know people,

1520
01:29:46.951 --> 01:29:49.950
I glance at this shit right before I started the podcast.
So basically

1521
01:29:51.450 --> 01:29:55.020
they combine the two of those.
I don't know why.

1522
01:29:55.980 --> 01:30:00.690
The whole fucking thing is weird and it has to do
with life,

1523
01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:03.660
I guess.
And Jesus coming back from the dead,

1524
01:30:04.830 --> 01:30:07.020
coming back to life and the eggs.

1525
01:30:07.021 --> 01:30:10.770
The latter fucking though it makes no goddamn sense to me.
I mean,

1526
01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:11.671
you know what it is.

1527
01:30:11.671 --> 01:30:16.140
I think the story of those guys walking into the cave and somebody getting

1528
01:30:16.141 --> 01:30:20.250
nailed to a goddamn cross and then somebody having to stick their hand in the

1529
01:30:20.251 --> 01:30:24.910
side of a human being like they're reaching into a giant wallet was just too

1530
01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:26.390
crazy.
It

1531
01:30:28.530 --> 01:30:33.480
was just too creepy to say to kids,
so you got to come up with this shit,
right?

1532
01:30:33.481 --> 01:30:35.970
You know it was pre TV.
What do you do?

1533
01:30:35.971 --> 01:30:39.600
Just give him a basket full of fucking colored eggs and some candy.

1534
01:30:40.250 --> 01:30:41.011
Do you know when I was a kid,

1535
01:30:41.011 --> 01:30:44.010
I thought those Cadbury eggs were chocolate fucking eggs.

1536
01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:47.410
Remember that commercial buck,
buck,
buck,
buck,
buck,
buck,
buck,
buck,
buck,
buck,
buck,

1537
01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:50.490
buck.
Remember that in the fucking rabbit was sitting there.

1538
01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:52.950
I thought that the,

1539
01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:55.770
and I thought they were disgusting and I have a sweet tooth and I never got them

1540
01:30:55.771 --> 01:30:57.060
because when they broke them open,

1541
01:30:57.061 --> 01:31:00.480
it looked like a fucking egg yolk inside of it.
And I was like,

1542
01:31:00.481 --> 01:31:04.410
there's no way that that's,
I don't want to chocolate covered egg.
Oh,

1543
01:31:05.330 --> 01:31:08.790
hi Luna.
[inaudible] let's get on with the podcast for this week.

1544
01:31:08.791 --> 01:31:11.310
I have a couple of announcements.
So what I was,
what I was trying to say,

1545
01:31:11.311 --> 01:31:12.690
I don't even know if I've said at this point,

1546
01:31:12.810 --> 01:31:14.920
this is why I never do podcasts when I travel,
but I had,

1547
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:18.480
I had a quick trip came in from Detroit.
Um,

1548
01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:23.370
so rather than just do the one podcast and have Bobby,

1549
01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:27.930
Bobby,
Bobby Kelly,
my old roommate,

1550
01:31:28.050 --> 01:31:30.540
we're going to tell stories about how we used to live together and we almost

1551
01:31:30.541 --> 01:31:31.710
beat the shit out of each other.

1552
01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:36.660
And that time he threw the racket ball when I had the Conan O'brien audition and

1553
01:31:36.661 --> 01:31:37.860
it record shade off the wall,

1554
01:31:37.861 --> 01:31:40.800
went into the bathroom and hit me in the mouth and cut my fucking lip right

1555
01:31:40.801 --> 01:31:45.801
before I had to go down and showcase for the Conan people as he was riding on

1556
01:31:45.901 --> 01:31:50.901
this bootleg stair master that he fucking took off the sidewalk because he grew

1557
01:31:51.241 --> 01:31:56.100
up in a fucking junk yard.
All right.
That's one of the stories.
Will be telling.

1558
01:31:56.101 --> 01:32:00.850
And then we're also going to be lucky enough to have the teen idols sensation

1559
01:32:00.851 --> 01:32:05.350
from the opiate Anthony Program.
Joe De Rosa,
everybody,
Joe de Roses,

1560
01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:09.400
also going to be on the Monday morning podcast,
this special edition,

1561
01:32:09.820 --> 01:32:10.391
the limit,

1562
01:32:10.391 --> 01:32:15.391
the Shelby gt 500 edition of this mother fucking podcast.

1563
01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:21.010
Um,
Oh,
speaking of which,
uh,
last week,
uh,

1564
01:32:21.011 --> 01:32:25.060
we added a donation button,
bunch of people donated.
I really appreciate it.

1565
01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:25.790
You know,

1566
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:30.790
I'm able to fucking pay my web guy few more fucking dollars.

1567
01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:33.850
And,
uh,
eventually,
you know,

1568
01:32:33.851 --> 01:32:36.130
I'm going to be able to hire somebody to help me with this mixer.

1569
01:32:36.131 --> 01:32:39.220
So it sounds okay.
I'm going to have a whole little fucking radio station.

1570
01:32:39.221 --> 01:32:41.970
I'm taking this thing to the next level people,
uh,

1571
01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:45.130
but some of you guys were actually having difficulty finding the,
uh,

1572
01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:48.400
the podcast donation button.

1573
01:32:48.401 --> 01:32:53.220
If you just go on the mmp.com the official fan page of the Monday morning

1574
01:32:53.221 --> 01:32:57.930
podcast.
If you just go on there,
um,
if you look under the icons on the right,

1575
01:32:57.931 --> 01:33:02.610
you'll see the Twitter,
Facebook a and something else over there.

1576
01:33:02.611 --> 01:33:04.050
Those icons,
you know,

1577
01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:07.830
right underneath that you'll see donate and there's a big donate button.

1578
01:33:07.831 --> 01:33:11.610
You just click on that and whatever you want to give people been given like 10,

1579
01:33:11.611 --> 01:33:15.900
20 bucks.
The average has been about 20 bucks.
I've had a couple of ridiculous,

1580
01:33:17.190 --> 01:33:19.950
uh,
donations from people and,
um,

1581
01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:23.130
I tried to write back as many as you can as I could to say thanks.

1582
01:33:23.131 --> 01:33:25.200
I'm going to write back some more today after I do this.

1583
01:33:25.550 --> 01:33:30.090
I really appreciate you guys kicking in and all the,
uh,
positive feedback I got.

1584
01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:33.700
I really appreciate you guys kicking in for this thing.
Um,

1585
01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:37.130
and I'm going to take the money and reinvest into this fucking thing and I

1586
01:33:37.530 --> 01:33:39.970
realized I got myself a little radio show here.
I'm kind of excited.

1587
01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:44.770
I'm kind of excited about this and I want to take it to another level.
Um,

1588
01:33:44.771 --> 01:33:48.340
and speaking of another level,
um,

1589
01:33:48.610 --> 01:33:53.610
the Tribeca film festival has begun and cheat the film that we did.

1590
01:33:54.370 --> 01:33:57.560
Um,
our film cheat as I should say,
uh,

1591
01:33:57.580 --> 01:34:00.070
debuted last night and uh,

1592
01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:05.100
they put us on at the end of eight different films and evidently I wasn't there.

1593
01:34:07.150 --> 01:34:11.710
Joe De Rosa fresh off his fucking cover shoot of teen beat magazine,

1594
01:34:13.390 --> 01:34:17.260
uh,
was there.
And once he got done signing autographs for all the kids,

1595
01:34:17.261 --> 01:34:21.370
he went in and evidently according to him I got a text,
he said,

1596
01:34:21.371 --> 01:34:25.260
the film fucking killed.
Uh,
I don't,

1597
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:28.730
I can't even tell you the last time I was at excited,
I was like really nervous.

1598
01:34:30.260 --> 01:34:33.270
Um,
and I got to give him Kudos because I wouldn't have the balls to sit there.

1599
01:34:33.330 --> 01:34:33.710
And just the,

1600
01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:38.710
the unbelievable lack of power that you'd have in that situation.

1601
01:34:38.780 --> 01:34:41.690
As a comedian,
I'm standing,
it's live.
If it's not funny,

1602
01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:45.350
I can do something about it in the moment.
Even if I'm doing like the podcast,

1603
01:34:45.351 --> 01:34:47.870
I can feel when it's not funny,
I'll make,
I'll can do something,

1604
01:34:47.871 --> 01:34:51.410
but film is done and you just sit in there and if it's not working,

1605
01:34:51.411 --> 01:34:55.370
you can't stop it.
You can't Improv,
you can't feed the crowds.

1606
01:34:55.371 --> 01:34:58.100
You just sit in there.
It's done.
Um,

1607
01:34:59.210 --> 01:35:03.920
but evidently he sat there and a,
I guess it fucking killed and uh,

1608
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:06.020
we're hoping all the other screens are going to go that way.

1609
01:35:06.021 --> 01:35:09.980
Pretty much all the shows are sold out.
So I want to thank everybody once again,

1610
01:35:10.370 --> 01:35:14.270
it's a big love fest here.
I want to thank everybody for uh,

1611
01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:15.770
for coming out and support in the film.

1612
01:35:15.910 --> 01:35:18.410
I hope you guys enjoyed those of you get tickets,
those who,

1613
01:35:18.820 --> 01:35:19.970
who aren't going to be able to see it.

1614
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:24.770
We will definitely figure out a way to get it out there to you guys so you will

1615
01:35:24.771 --> 01:35:26.510
be able to see it.
And uh,

1616
01:35:26.511 --> 01:35:29.030
and with that you want to get something to so much of a maniac sports fan.

1617
01:35:29.031 --> 01:35:33.650
I am though.
However,
despite the fact that I got offstage,

1618
01:35:33.980 --> 01:35:36.950
sold out show at the Royal Oak Theater,
Royal Oak,
Michigan,

1619
01:35:37.220 --> 01:35:40.810
want to thank everyone who came out for that fucking thing.
I get off stage.

1620
01:35:41.340 --> 01:35:42.020
All right.

1621
01:35:42.020 --> 01:35:47.020
And I am well aware that the Bruins and the Canadians are in double overtime.

1622
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:51.470
Now last week,
you remember the Bruins lost the first two.

1623
01:35:51.471 --> 01:35:56.471
All the Montreal fans are walking away from their NP fucking three players right

1624
01:35:57.471 --> 01:35:59.000
now,
aren't you?
Where way you going?

1625
01:36:02.250 --> 01:36:06.050
Come back.
Sit down.
Sit down and take it a little bit.

1626
01:36:06.840 --> 01:36:10.120
All right.
You mother fuckers.
You sent me a lot.

1627
01:36:10.200 --> 01:36:14.780
He is snooty little French Canadian fucking emails talking about how Boston

1628
01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:17.690
Bruins were done because we lost the first two are at home.
Didn't you?

1629
01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:22.340
Did look at me.
Come on Jack up here.
I'm up here.
I'm up here.
Yeah,

1630
01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:27.050
you sent me a bunch of fucking emails saying that we were finished.
All right,

1631
01:36:27.051 --> 01:36:31.760
and what did I say?
I said last week.
Ask Not know.

1632
01:36:31.761 --> 01:36:35.660
I said last week that we weren't finished and I said that we were going to

1633
01:36:35.661 --> 01:36:39.440
fucking kill them and game three we didn't kill him,
but we beat them.
All right.

1634
01:36:39.530 --> 01:36:42.650
For those of you aren't hockey fans,
we beat them in their fucking building.

1635
01:36:43.280 --> 01:36:47.000
They could have gone up three Oh now it's two one.
Oh no big deal.

1636
01:36:47.001 --> 01:36:50.660
Just win game four.
They're up three one they got another home game.
No Way.

1637
01:36:50.661 --> 01:36:53.900
The Bruins are gonna win again.
It in their fucking building.

1638
01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:59.000
This is the fucking
Montreal Canadians,
right.

1639
01:36:59.270 --> 01:37:03.690
I saw a video on youtube that was hyping this series and when the,

1640
01:37:03.740 --> 01:37:06.410
all they showed was the Canadians kicking the shit out of the Bruins.

1641
01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:10.040
Even like modern day footage.
Then winning fights,
everything in the,
in the,

1642
01:37:10.041 --> 01:37:11.090
in the,
in the,

1643
01:37:11.091 --> 01:37:16.091
the narrator goes to to close it out and said pretty much owned the Bruins

1644
01:37:16.311 --> 01:37:18.230
forever.
Right

1645
01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:21.320
now and did that get my blood going?

1646
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:26.350
It's like they haven't owned the Bruins since pre 1988 okay.

1647
01:37:27.111 --> 01:37:30.860
Up to 90 87 they fucking owned our asses.
We couldn't beat them,

1648
01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:34.010
but since then they've been a nonfactor.

1649
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:38.690
We've met them 10 times in the playoffs.
We've beaten him six times.

1650
01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:42.530
The last time we played them,
we beat them four games in a fucking row,

1651
01:37:42.531 --> 01:37:46.070
the last two in their building.
I don't get it.

1652
01:37:47.180 --> 01:37:51.620
They're not in the way of us or anybody else winning a cup then not who they

1653
01:37:51.621 --> 01:37:56.550
used to be.
They dominated a 16 league that it's,
that's it.
It's over.

1654
01:37:56.970 --> 01:38:00.540
And then the hangover of the expansion six until everybody got on their fucking

1655
01:38:00.541 --> 01:38:03.690
feet and then the added the Edmonton Oilers and the 70s were over.

1656
01:38:03.691 --> 01:38:08.280
They haven't dominated sense.
All right.
Enough already with that bullshit.

1657
01:38:08.610 --> 01:38:10.620
So anyways,
all they gotta do is win game four.

1658
01:38:10.621 --> 01:38:14.220
What happens to fucking Bruins when it,
and over time,
now it's two,
two,

1659
01:38:14.690 --> 01:38:19.350
but going back to Boston,
right last night,
double over time,
fucking game.

1660
01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.500
I'm on stage missing every fucking second of it.

1661
01:38:22.501 --> 01:38:25.410
Having the time of my life though,
having a great time.

1662
01:38:25.411 --> 01:38:28.290
All these people showed up in fucking Detroit,

1663
01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:33.320
absolutely beautiful fucking town that just needs a coat of paint and evidently

1664
01:38:33.811 --> 01:38:38.811
some windows and then you really need to like Detroit looks like a hurricane

1665
01:38:39.271 --> 01:38:42.780
came and everybody boarded up there fucking windows and they never bothered to

1666
01:38:42.781 --> 01:38:44.940
take it off.
That's what it really looks like.

1667
01:38:44.941 --> 01:38:48.210
It's sad because they have these beautiful brick houses.

1668
01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:51.990
There's a few cities that I go to and it makes me sad how beautiful they are.

1669
01:38:51.991 --> 01:38:56.340
And they've just been run down Detroit,
Cleveland,
um,

1670
01:38:56.370 --> 01:38:58.650
upper Darby when I went there and,
uh,

1671
01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:03.920
last couple of weeks ago did tower theater and affiliates just,
it's just,

1672
01:39:03.921 --> 01:39:04.754
it's awful.

1673
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:09.350
It's like you're looking at like 200 seasons of this old house.

1674
01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:13.040
You could just have a never ending of people coming in and fixing up these

1675
01:39:13.041 --> 01:39:16.310
awesome houses and making them great again.
But anyways,

1676
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:21.500
so I get off stage.
This is how much of a fucking psycho sports fan am.

1677
01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:24.860
I know that the,
uh,

1678
01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:28.100
our film is debuting at the Tribeca film festival.

1679
01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:29.450
This is the first film I've ever done.

1680
01:39:29.451 --> 01:39:33.770
Like this where I was involved at this level.
Okay.
And I opened,

1681
01:39:33.771 --> 01:39:38.150
I look at my phone and I get a text from Joe Derosa,
right?

1682
01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:39.613
And it says,

1683
01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:40.873
<v 8>ah,
okay.</v>

1684
01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:45.410
<v 6>The,
the film fucking killed with like 20 exclamation points behind it.</v>

1685
01:39:45.770 --> 01:39:49.460
So I'm totally psyched.
Now once you think that,

1686
01:39:49.461 --> 01:39:51.980
that would be my first phone call to find it at.
Now,

1687
01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:57.200
the first thing I'm doing is I'm looking for texts from fellow Bruins fans and

1688
01:39:57.201 --> 01:39:59.600
I'm not getting anything that's let me know what happened.

1689
01:39:59.900 --> 01:40:02.450
I got a couple of texts saying,
can you fucking believe this?

1690
01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:04.040
Cause it was this unbelievable game

1691
01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:06.150
<v 8>and uh,</v>

1692
01:40:06.650 --> 01:40:11.330
<v 6>but nothing saying whether they want a loss.
And My fucking heart sunk in.</v>

1693
01:40:11.331 --> 01:40:16.100
It reminded me of the time I was watching working the Improv in DC and the

1694
01:40:16.101 --> 01:40:19.520
fucking patriots were playing the Colts in the AFC championship game and we were

1695
01:40:19.521 --> 01:40:21.310
up like 20 to nothing or something,
right?

1696
01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:24.270
<v 8>The half.
And uh,</v>

1697
01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:29.070
<v 6>I've got a bunch of calls from pats fans,
gonna Peyton Manning's choking again,</v>

1698
01:40:29.071 --> 01:40:30.180
can you fucking believe this?

1699
01:40:30.450 --> 01:40:34.290
And when all these pats fans were already calling me,
and when I got off stage,

1700
01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:38.640
when the show was over,
90 fucking minutes later after I sold DVDs,

1701
01:40:38.641 --> 01:40:43.641
probably about two hours later I got off and I had no text and no messages and I

1702
01:40:43.891 --> 01:40:47.010
was like,
oh,
called up,

1703
01:40:47.011 --> 01:40:49.320
found out the fucking colts actually came back to win.

1704
01:40:49.410 --> 01:40:53.250
So I get off stage and all I have is people reacting to the overtime.

1705
01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:54.070
And then I don't get any

1706
01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:57.940
<v 3>fucking texts.
So I assumed the worst that the Canadians won.</v>

1707
01:40:59.050 --> 01:41:03.220
And I called up a somebody.
I said,
what happened?
Eyes fucking squinting.

1708
01:41:03.490 --> 01:41:08.490
Cop made this call before I found out about the film and what did I find out?

1709
01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:13.870
What did I find out the fucking Bruins wanted?
Now we're up three games to two.

1710
01:41:14.620 --> 01:41:18.010
Okay?
Against this team that's pretty much owned as forever.

1711
01:41:18.011 --> 01:41:19.390
Give me a fucking break.

1712
01:41:21.190 --> 01:41:24.370
You guys owned us and I fucking own the fact that you owned us,

1713
01:41:24.371 --> 01:41:29.371
but you have not owned us since 1988 you have not stand the fuck down.

1714
01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:34.180
It's been a whole different era since then.
Enough already.
How far?

1715
01:41:34.210 --> 01:41:37.510
You know what it is?
It's just lazy sports journalism.

1716
01:41:37.511 --> 01:41:41.710
You just Dustin off that same fucking stupid story enough already.

1717
01:41:41.711 --> 01:41:45.160
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Whoever wrote that piece.
All right,

1718
01:41:45.161 --> 01:41:47.530
two thumbs down from this Bruins fan.
So that's the deal,
dude.

1719
01:41:47.620 --> 01:41:51.700
It's fucking three to two and now we're going up to Montreal with once again

1720
01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:56.760
with an opportunity to close out this series in fucking Montreal.

1721
01:41:57.190 --> 01:42:00.790
And not to mention I also twittered.
I don't tweet I Twitter.

1722
01:42:01.030 --> 01:42:03.880
I said a few days ago,
what did I say?
I'm going to be that guy,
dude.

1723
01:42:03.881 --> 01:42:07.120
I called it this week.
I fucking said this game.

1724
01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:10.240
The series is going seven and Tim Thomas is going to be the difference.

1725
01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:13.480
Carrie prices not there yet.
I'm telling you,

1726
01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:17.050
we're going to beat these mother fuckers.
You hear me?
Montreal,

1727
01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:21.880
we're going to fucking beat you sons of bitches.
All right,
and then what?

1728
01:42:22.630 --> 01:42:25.720
Then what?
Then we're going to be going on 25 years.

1729
01:42:25.721 --> 01:42:28.330
A quarter of a century of you guys not own in us.

1730
01:42:28.450 --> 01:42:32.470
I you still going to dust that fucking story of it's over.

1731
01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:34.773
It's over.

1732
01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:38.920
You guys are over and this fucking series is over because we're closing it out

1733
01:42:39.010 --> 01:42:41.440
and games.
I'm fucking with you.
You know what I really think's going to happen?

1734
01:42:41.590 --> 01:42:42.011
I think.

1735
01:42:42.011 --> 01:42:47.011
I don't think that the Montreal fans are going to allow their team to lose this

1736
01:42:47.081 --> 01:42:50.920
series in their building.
You know,
this is the one thing I got to give.

1737
01:42:51.020 --> 01:42:55.120
I've got to give a couple of things to the fucking Canadians aside from having

1738
01:42:55.540 --> 01:42:59.060
one of the best uniforms in sports,
despite the fact that when I look at it,
I,

1739
01:42:59.061 --> 01:43:01.990
I it makes me fucking rage.

1740
01:43:02.710 --> 01:43:05.350
I gotta admit it's a great fucking uniform.
Number two,

1741
01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:08.920
your fans are fucking ridiculous.
They just,
they're just awesome fans.

1742
01:43:09.250 --> 01:43:12.730
You're obnoxious,
you're snooty or whatever.
But I mean though,

1743
01:43:12.731 --> 01:43:14.740
the way that you guys push your team,

1744
01:43:15.250 --> 01:43:17.950
that's why I think you guys are going to win game six because of that shit.

1745
01:43:18.370 --> 01:43:19.510
And also,
uh,

1746
01:43:19.511 --> 01:43:23.350
I really hope that sue is going to be a fucking free agent and we can sign them.

1747
01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:26.770
Cause I think that guy's the shit and he's going to be a star.
Other than that,

1748
01:43:27.070 --> 01:43:30.940
go fuck yourselves.
Go eat a fucking croissant or whatever.

1749
01:43:32.260 --> 01:43:32.320
Uh,

1750
01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:37.320
and get ready to start golfing people because this series is fucking,

1751
01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:39.910
oh,
I'm fucking with you.

1752
01:43:39.911 --> 01:43:42.310
I never talk shit like this and I'm not confident that it's over.

1753
01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:45.430
This thing changed on a dime and it can change back again.

1754
01:43:46.090 --> 01:43:49.120
When the fuck am I going to get a job in one of these sports channels and put on

1755
01:43:49.121 --> 01:43:53.330
a sport coat and sit there with my little pen,
tapping it,

1756
01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:57.230
waiting to chime in as the straight laced guy.
You know,
Yo,

1757
01:43:57.231 --> 01:44:00.170
they always got the straight laced guy going up in Montreal,

1758
01:44:02.670 --> 01:44:04.900
the Blue Block,
a ruse or above the blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1759
01:44:04.910 --> 01:44:06.170
What are you gonna say about that bill?

1760
01:44:06.290 --> 01:44:09.410
And I'm the fucking moron who wears like a short sleeve shirt under a blazer.

1761
01:44:09.530 --> 01:44:13.980
<v 9>Well,
I tell you,
if I'm Karie price,
I gotta be thinking,
okay.</v>

1762
01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:17.360
<v 3>Um,
all right.
I know what people are saying.
Way Too much sports talk.
Well,</v>

1763
01:44:17.361 --> 01:44:21.400
why don't you go fucking read a book then.
What do you want me to get back to my,

1764
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:26.150
my amazing,
uh,
talks about history.
I don't know.
Shit.

1765
01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:30.430
All right.
You listen to me.
Hear me itching that fucking beard.
All right.

1766
01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:35.600
I have another announcement to make this week.
Uh,
Seattle,
the,
uh,

1767
01:44:35.601 --> 01:44:40.070
anti social network tour,
the,
uh,
the brilliant comedian,

1768
01:44:40.190 --> 01:44:44.330
comedic,
a fucking brainchild,
whatever,
whatever,
what does that expression,

1769
01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:50.220
whatever the,
the,
the,
the,
the,
the lineup.

1770
01:44:51.220 --> 01:44:53.970
Goddammit.
I'm trying to hype this.
What is the fucking word?
Uh,
gives a shit.

1771
01:44:53.971 --> 01:44:57.690
I'm too stupid.
Look,
Jim Norton came up with this great idea.
He said,

1772
01:44:57.691 --> 01:45:01.980
you know what?
I got to show down in Atlantic City,
New Jersey.
I do whatever year.

1773
01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:06.540
What if I brought down a couple of pals?
A couple of buddies brought down David.

1774
01:45:06.541 --> 01:45:11.250
Tell Jim Breuer and myself,
we had a great time.
People showed up.

1775
01:45:11.251 --> 01:45:14.700
We had to add shows.
We like,
Holy Shit.
This could be something.

1776
01:45:14.701 --> 01:45:18.840
So now we're adding cities.
Uh,
the next city that we are adding is Seattle.

1777
01:45:20.130 --> 01:45:23.900
Um,
I,
uh,
I am officially announcing Seattle a die.

1778
01:45:24.020 --> 01:45:26.760
I'm officially announcing it without the fucking date.
Of course.

1779
01:45:27.630 --> 01:45:31.500
I am the fucking worst.
I had everything laid out.
There it is.

1780
01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:38.210
Here it is.
I got it right now.
I don't.
Here's a new button I hit.

1781
01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:42.250

Come on out and check out a three amazing fucking comedians and myself

1797
01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:49.350
mopping up,
not even mopping up.
I'm coming out of the gate.
Um,

1798
01:46:49.351 --> 01:46:51.780
anyways.
Uh,

1799
01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:55.470
what was I just going to say about Seattle that I have anything else to hype

1800
01:46:55.471 --> 01:46:59.730
about that?
Oh,
I know zen we got,
we got that same tour.

1801
01:46:59.731 --> 01:47:02.220
If you like that line up and you live in different parts of the country,

1802
01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:06.540
that's a west west coast date.
If you want a Midwest date,
um,

1803
01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:10.680
June 15th,
we're at the Chicago Theater in Chicago,
Illinois,

1804
01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:15.960
one of the most underrated cities in this goddamn country.
And,
um,

1805
01:47:16.170 --> 01:47:18.030
if you live on the east coast,
uh,

1806
01:47:18.210 --> 01:47:23.210
May 30th we're going to be at constitution hall in Washington DC.

1807
01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:27.600
I can't wait to do that gig because fans of a standup comedy,

1808
01:47:28.170 --> 01:47:30.270
I might be a little wrong on a couple of these specials,

1809
01:47:30.271 --> 01:47:32.790
but I know Eddie Murphy tape delirious there.

1810
01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:37.710
I believe Martin Lawrence taped a special there and Chris rock did.

1811
01:47:37.711 --> 01:47:41.730
I don't know which Chris rock one.
So,
uh,

1812
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:47.310
I think it's fitting that four white guys are now going to come in and hold

1813
01:47:47.311 --> 01:47:52.230
hands and do one giant show.
All right.
To take that venue back.

1814
01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:55.410
No,
I'm kidding.
Um,
the fuck was that all about,

1815
01:47:55.411 --> 01:47:58.230
I think that was one for the truckers.
Um,
all right,

1816
01:47:58.231 --> 01:47:59.700
let's plow ahead with the podcast here.

1817
01:47:59.701 --> 01:48:04.500
People not put the announcements enough with the bullshit.
Uh,
let's get to uh,

1818
01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:11.520
AH,
Jesus Christ.
Bill,
why don't I have this fucking laid out?
Oh,
I know.

1819
01:48:11.521 --> 01:48:16.320
Last week I asked you guys,
I said,
uh,
can you guys help me out?

1820
01:48:17.610 --> 01:48:18.000
You know,

1821
01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.590
by giving me a little bit of feedback on last week's podcast to help me keep the

1822
01:48:22.591 --> 01:48:25.290
fucking ball in the air here for an hour.
And here's something.

1823
01:48:25.291 --> 01:48:28.140
Last week we were talking about,
uh,
STDs.

1824
01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:33.120
Somebody wrote in and was talking about how they met this wonderful lady.

1825
01:48:34.650 --> 01:48:38.520
Okay?
And he goes to the zoo and they're not looking at the ostriches.

1826
01:48:38.710 --> 01:48:40.110
Then I looking at the gorillas there,

1827
01:48:40.111 --> 01:48:44.190
fucking looking into each other's eyes and they just totally connecting.

1828
01:48:44.190 --> 01:48:49.170
You like juggling.
I like juggling,
right?
Totally hit it off.
Then it finds out,

1829
01:48:49.171 --> 01:48:54.090
she finds out,
the dude finds out she's got herpes.
What do I do?

1830
01:48:55.980 --> 01:48:58.890
Wow.
Let's just remind me that old sesame street song.
No left turn.

1831
01:48:59.070 --> 01:49:03.570
No right turn foam.
What do you do?
Remember that one.

1832
01:49:04.410 --> 01:49:08.370
Every once in a while and old sesame street song pops into my head.

1833
01:49:10.410 --> 01:49:13.230
Um,
and uh,
you know what I was thinking of the one the other day.

1834
01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:18.690
Do you remember Bob Soap?
All white man?
You remember him from the,
uh,

1835
01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:22.980
from a sesame street?
Bob was one of the widest guys ever,

1836
01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:25.140
and they sang a song,

1837
01:49:25.141 --> 01:49:29.550
I think it was teaching you about your fucking the shit on your face and

1838
01:49:30.110 --> 01:49:34.050
everybody's singing.
I got it.
I got a nose.
I got a mouth.
I got,
I got two years.

1839
01:49:34.051 --> 01:49:38.340
I got two eyes.
The singing,
this little ditty.
I remember Susan,

1840
01:49:38.341 --> 01:49:39.570
the black girl on there,
right?

1841
01:49:39.571 --> 01:49:44.100
She sang about the ears right before Bob and she totally sasses it up,

1842
01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:48.490
which made Bob sound even wider.
I forget all the whole song went.
But Susan,

1843
01:49:48.491 --> 01:49:53.290
the black chick went first and then Bob,
who made fucking,
uh,

1844
01:49:54.070 --> 01:49:57.890
John Denver looked like a fucking,
like,
he was in the,

1845
01:49:58.060 --> 01:49:59.260
the Goddamn crips.

1846
01:49:59.950 --> 01:50:03.010
So she sings about the ears and then he comes on the Somme basically.

1847
01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:07.840
I don't think I remember it.
She goes,
I got to,
is to help me.

1848
01:50:08.150 --> 01:50:09.790
And he goes,
I've got

1849
01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:14.260
<v 10>two
[inaudible].
They're both the same size.</v>

1850
01:50:15.980 --> 01:50:16.740
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

1851
01:50:16.740 --> 01:50:21.740
<v 3>And I remember being like five or six years old thinking there was something</v>

1852
01:50:21.991 --> 01:50:24.810
wrong with Bob that he shouldn't have sung it that way.

1853
01:50:25.770 --> 01:50:27.300
Can anybody send me a link to that?

1854
01:50:27.980 --> 01:50:30.010
<v 10>I've got two [inaudible].</v>

1855
01:50:30.830 --> 01:50:34.730
<v 3>Oh,
Bob,
what happened?
What happened to you?</v>

1856
01:50:34.731 --> 01:50:38.990
How did you grow up in the fifties isolated.
Did you have a bomb shelter?

1857
01:50:39.050 --> 01:50:44.050
Did you put your fucking white head between your white knees out there in the

1858
01:50:44.570 --> 01:50:45.403
White Culdesac?
Is that what happened?

1859
01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:50.550
Then you found out you had a love of music but you couldn't sing rock and roll's

1860
01:50:50.550 --> 01:50:51.780
.
Everybody called you cool.

1861
01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:53.090
<v 6>Where</v>

1862
01:50:53.090 --> 01:50:53.930
<v 3>and then what happened?</v>

1863
01:50:53.931 --> 01:50:57.440
You got into sock puppets and next thing you know you meet a guy named Jim

1864
01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:00.140
Henson.
It makes a pass at you,
grabs your ass.

1865
01:51:00.141 --> 01:51:04.700
You start just shove your face into his bed.
You guys are making out,
right?
Ugh.

1866
01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:05.633
Disgusting.
All right.

1867
01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:07.533
<v 11>Yeah.</v>

1868
01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:13.100
<v 3>Is nobody with the beard safe on this podcast?</v>

1869
01:51:13.280 --> 01:51:17.680
First Jesus and now Jim Henson.
Um,

1870
01:51:18.370 --> 01:51:21.140
and you know it's funny Jim Henson's bird a bird.

1871
01:51:21.141 --> 01:51:26.090
His fucking beard kind of looks like one of those Easter egg basket fucking

1872
01:51:26.091 --> 01:51:30.080
things,
right?
You know what?
You guys can go fuck yourself right now.

1873
01:51:30.081 --> 01:51:32.910
I know it's off the rails.
I know this whole thing is just gone dead.

1874
01:51:32.940 --> 01:51:36.890
Just went down an alley that has no exit.
I mean here sweating.

1875
01:51:36.891 --> 01:51:39.660
I shouldn't be sweating while doing this.
You know,
it's funny,
I'm,
I'm,

1876
01:51:39.670 --> 01:51:43.360
I'm in my old bedroom right back in the day when I was a single man,

1877
01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:46.090
when I used to bring back the broads.
Okay.

1878
01:51:46.490 --> 01:51:48.110
<v 6>Oh God.
The nightmares I used to be,
you know,</v>

1879
01:51:48.111 --> 01:51:52.220
so you don't really fuck me up was Dr Drew,
Dr Drew.

1880
01:51:52.430 --> 01:51:57.320
Like if I met doctor drew,
I've done a show a couple of times,
right?

1881
01:51:57.740 --> 01:51:58.670
His love line thing,

1882
01:51:58.671 --> 01:52:02.800
if I did his show 10 fucking years ago,

1883
01:52:02.801 --> 01:52:04.540
I swear to God there,

1884
01:52:04.570 --> 01:52:08.740
there's a good eight or nine girls I never would have hooked up with.

1885
01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:13.660
Just it's,
it's fucking unreal.
You gotta listen to that guy show.

1886
01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:18.050
I realize the reason why I,

1887
01:52:19.110 --> 01:52:19.410
<v 12>okay.</v>

1888
01:52:19.410 --> 01:52:23.790
<v 6>Probably a third of the women that I fucking hooked up was I was damaged and I</v>

1889
01:52:23.791 --> 01:52:27.330
was going out hooking up with other damaged people and that was the connection.

1890
01:52:28.170 --> 01:52:32.640
And then we had this fucking crazy,
I'm not even going to get into it.

1891
01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:37.070
You got to listen to his show.
He's fucking unreal.

1892
01:52:37.820 --> 01:52:40.190
They sit there and they see people call in like the girls that have this little

1893
01:52:40.640 --> 01:52:41.300
mousy voices,

1894
01:52:41.300 --> 01:52:46.130
you know those voices that turn guys on those creepy little voices today?

1895
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:50.780
<v 3>Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
me and my boyfriend and he just immediately goes,</v>

1896
01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:52.610
what happened to you when you were five?

1897
01:52:53.480 --> 01:52:55.520
And you find out they got molested when they were five.

1898
01:52:55.521 --> 01:53:00.020
And then there was some sort of fucking like,
I don't know what you call it.

1899
01:53:00.021 --> 01:53:02.980
They just stopped growing mentally and they kept talking that way.
I see.

1900
01:53:02.981 --> 01:53:04.390
It just fucking blows my mind member.

1901
01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:07.760
Back in the day when a girl came up talking like that,
you're like,

1902
01:53:07.761 --> 01:53:09.620
this girl's easy,
right?

1903
01:53:10.610 --> 01:53:13.430
[inaudible] Baba talking like pebbles on the Goddamn Flintstones.

1904
01:53:14.570 --> 01:53:15.710
What happened then?
You dictate.

1905
01:53:15.711 --> 01:53:20.660
So here's an easy one to fucking knock out of the park.
I didn't realize it.

1906
01:53:21.930 --> 01:53:26.380
I feel like some sort of fucking pervert
Jesus.

1907
01:53:26.381 --> 01:53:29.350
That wasn't funny at all.
It wasn't what was on my chest.
I had to get it off.

1908
01:53:29.351 --> 01:53:30.400
All right,
so let's plow ahead.

1909
01:53:30.401 --> 01:53:32.830
So last week this person was sitting there talking about,
you know,

1910
01:53:32.831 --> 01:53:36.580
so he met some lady and she had the fucking,
uh,
you know,

1911
01:53:36.581 --> 01:53:40.120
she's got the blisters on a thing there.
Right.

1912
01:53:40.121 --> 01:53:42.340
And she of course tells an innocent story of,

1913
01:53:42.341 --> 01:53:46.570
it was one guy and he went down on me and he had a cold sore and that was it.

1914
01:53:47.530 --> 01:53:51.430
That's when somebody has an STD.
That's always how they tell the story.

1915
01:53:51.610 --> 01:53:52.960
They never say,
listen,

1916
01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:57.990
I was an absolute fucking whore and I was fucking everything that moved and I

1917
01:53:58.511 --> 01:54:03.190
really have no idea when I got it where I got it or who I gave it to.

1918
01:54:03.191 --> 01:54:06.520
All I know is I got it.
And if you want some of it,
I got it.

1919
01:54:06.521 --> 01:54:08.650
I got it right fucking here.

1920
01:54:09.610 --> 01:54:11.890
No one says that man or a woman there was just go,

1921
01:54:11.891 --> 01:54:16.150
I was on my way to Bible study and somebody said,

1922
01:54:16.151 --> 01:54:19.810
would you like a drink?
I didn't know what was in it.
Oh God,
I feel so foolish.

1923
01:54:19.811 --> 01:54:22.570
I feel like you're judging me.
And you're like,
no,
no,
I'm not judging you.

1924
01:54:24.660 --> 01:54:25.493
<v 12>Right.</v>

1925
01:54:26.850 --> 01:54:30.360
<v 3>No one was getting banged in a fucking Jacuzzi.
No one got it that way.
Did they?</v>

1926
01:54:31.140 --> 01:54:33.420
Right.
No one went down to a,

1927
01:54:33.421 --> 01:54:37.080
what does that freak nick or what do they call that hedonism where everybody

1928
01:54:37.081 --> 01:54:41.490
goes down to that fucking the Haiti and fucks,
you know,

1929
01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:44.130
before the earthquake.
I guess I got to move it now.

1930
01:54:45.390 --> 01:54:47.580
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.
Jamaica.
Is that where you go?

1931
01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:51.510
It's just fucking crazy,
you know?
Or they go down to Brazil.
He says,

1932
01:54:51.570 --> 01:54:54.780
I went to Brazil and banged a bunch of whores and I don't even know what I have.

1933
01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:58.110
I got,
I got south of the border,
fucking gonorrhea,

1934
01:55:03.490 --> 01:55:04.950
you know.
No one says that.

1935
01:55:06.390 --> 01:55:10.170
No one says that there was a Mariachi band and I was banging this girl in the

1936
01:55:10.171 --> 01:55:15.171
dirt outside some fucking bar and Tiawana and that's how I got syphilis.

1937
01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:20.190
No one says that.
It's always an innocent fucking story.

1938
01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:24.000
And they always look down and I think of course,
cause there's shame involved,

1939
01:55:24.330 --> 01:55:28.020
but no one will own up to it.
No.
Just say,
listen,
you know,

1940
01:55:28.530 --> 01:55:32.310
I banged a lot of broads and I went in Ra.
Alright,

1941
01:55:33.480 --> 01:55:37.770
no vest,
no fucking robber,
no nothing.
I stuck it in there,

1942
01:55:39.170 --> 01:55:40.003
move it around.

1943
01:55:43.140 --> 01:55:48.140
I got all up in that disease and now it's on my dick and I just thought you

1944
01:55:48.961 --> 01:55:53.230
should know.
I add my time.
I had a good fucking time and uh,

1945
01:55:53.250 --> 01:55:54.720
now I'm paying for it.
All right.

1946
01:55:54.750 --> 01:55:58.530
You want to help me limp across the fucking finish line of life with my

1947
01:55:58.531 --> 01:56:01.530
blistered cock?
Is that what you want to do?
If you're up for it,

1948
01:56:01.531 --> 01:56:04.620
I'm just trying to be up front.
What did you order by the way?
Did you,

1949
01:56:04.621 --> 01:56:09.120
did you start with a,
did you get the muscles?
Um,
no one says that shit.

1950
01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:12.540
Jesus bill,
we got it.
So last week I was talking about saying,
you know what,

1951
01:56:12.620 --> 01:56:15.510
they and I had to fuck a website for people with STD so they don't got to go

1952
01:56:15.511 --> 01:56:18.150
through this shit.
And Lo and behold,
they got one,

1953
01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:23.220
they got a fucking site here.
People,
let me see what we got here.

1954
01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:27.600
Somebody they got do,
they pretty much got a fucking website for everything.

1955
01:56:27.601 --> 01:56:31.800
And I remember there was a guy a few weeks ago,
this fucking dude over there,

1956
01:56:31.801 --> 01:56:33.840
he fucking called.
He called me up,

1957
01:56:33.841 --> 01:56:37.960
he fucking sent me an email and he was telling me that they,
uh,

1958
01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:41.250
10 most bizarre dating websites.
Oh,
I know what I was going to say.

1959
01:56:41.970 --> 01:56:43.710
I can't read and think at the same time.

1960
01:56:43.711 --> 01:56:48.240
How fucked up is that or think about something else.
I can't multitask.
Um,

1961
01:56:49.020 --> 01:56:53.150
this guy sent me this email and he was saying that,
uh,
uh,

1962
01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:56.070
Jesus to fuck what the fuck was my point.

1963
01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:59.070
See now my brain is looking at this shit.
My brain,

1964
01:56:59.130 --> 01:57:03.060
it works in a straight line and two shit gets erased immediately.

1965
01:57:04.440 --> 01:57:09.140
The fuck did he say
this is unbelievable?

1966
01:57:10.730 --> 01:57:14.030
Is this,
is this how Reagan started?
Um,
all right,
fuck it.

1967
01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:19.160
I don't know what the fuck he said.
Oh,
I remember where I got it now.

1968
01:57:19.161 --> 01:57:23.660
He was talking about how he didn't want to do the online dating thing cause he

1969
01:57:23.661 --> 01:57:25.670
thought it was like this whole stigma and that type of shit.

1970
01:57:25.671 --> 01:57:26.570
And he felt like a loser.

1971
01:57:26.690 --> 01:57:29.330
We're kind of guy can't go out and get laid or on his own and go meet a girl.

1972
01:57:29.450 --> 01:57:30.410
Fuck that.

1973
01:57:30.830 --> 01:57:35.830
If I was a young dude and my goddamned prime as opposed to a fucking approaching

1974
01:57:35.871 --> 01:57:37.190
the end of his middle age,

1975
01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:41.690
which I gotta be cause you mold 42 times two is 84 right?

1976
01:57:41.691 --> 01:57:45.620
You think I'm making 85 I got news for you.
I am.

1977
01:57:45.890 --> 01:57:48.500
I'm making a 101.
I'm going to see the seventies again.

1978
01:57:49.760 --> 01:57:53.630
2070 I'm checking out.
Um,

1979
01:57:54.050 --> 01:57:55.970
I'm calling it right here.
That's my prediction.

1980
01:57:56.270 --> 01:57:59.420
Knows to Domus on my own fucking life.
Did he ever do that with themself?

1981
01:57:59.870 --> 01:58:04.820
That arrogant prick.
Do knows the dominance is so fucking overrated.

1982
01:58:04.821 --> 01:58:08.870
It's ridiculous in new futures.
Bad Shit's going to happen.
Really?

1983
01:58:10.430 --> 01:58:15.110
There's going to be a guy with a beard.
Say something to a bald guy.

1984
01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:19.970
Oh my God,
Dude.
Dead Saddam.
That's Gorbachev.
No,
you know what that is?

1985
01:58:20.210 --> 01:58:24.140
That's like when you get your horoscope read.
When you say a bunch of vague shit,

1986
01:58:24.770 --> 01:58:28.220
believers,
believers,
dumb people,

1987
01:58:29.150 --> 01:58:31.580
kind of people who sit in a pulpit,
you know,

1988
01:58:31.610 --> 01:58:35.120
and just listened to another human being tells stories about three headed

1989
01:58:35.121 --> 01:58:39.380
fucking dogs.
You know the whole thing's that dog and pony show.

1990
01:58:39.381 --> 01:58:42.850
Why are those ceiling so high?
They're trying to intimidate you.

1991
01:58:42.940 --> 01:58:47.620
Why are you sitting on a piece of wood?
Huh?
They can't have sofas.

1992
01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:51.640
They don't want you to lounge and they want you to sitting upright.
All nervous.

1993
01:58:51.641 --> 01:58:54.910
Like what?
What's going to happen to me?
Just tell me what I need to do.

1994
01:58:57.060 --> 01:59:00.930
You know?
Then they walk up those stairs made out of marble,

1995
01:59:01.950 --> 01:59:06.330
right.
Stand up there when they preach.
Was that so they can see.

1996
01:59:06.331 --> 01:59:10.800
You can see him now so it can be a little bit higher and fucking talk down to

1997
01:59:10.801 --> 01:59:14.790
you as you sit on your fucking wooden bench with no cushion.

1998
01:59:15.330 --> 01:59:20.170
Sit Up straight.
I'm channeling a higher power right now.

1999
01:59:21.020 --> 01:59:25.020
All right.
Anyway,

2000
01:59:25.021 --> 01:59:28.050
so this fucking guy writes me and he said,
he says it's a stigma dude.

2001
01:59:28.051 --> 01:59:31.170
They got a website for fucking everything.
If I was in my prime,

2002
01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:36.630
if I could do it over,
I would be all over the fucking Internet.

2003
01:59:37.650 --> 01:59:40.140
So they,
they have a website.
Okay.
First of all,
they have,

2004
01:59:40.200 --> 01:59:44.150
they have a website for people with STDs,
which I think is a great thing.
Yeah,

2005
01:59:44.210 --> 01:59:48.000
let's keep it in house.
No awkward conversation.
Ah,

2006
01:59:49.260 --> 01:59:53.250
fucking,
you know,
and then you can be honest about how you got it.

2007
01:59:53.251 --> 01:59:57.400
Where'd you get yours?
I got mine in fucking Chile.
Where'd you get yours?
Dude,

2008
01:59:57.401 --> 02:00:01.290
I was in the combat zone getting blown on a flight of stairs.
Right.

2009
02:00:01.820 --> 02:00:06.000
I got one fucking,
I dunno if she fucking bit my ball bag.

2010
02:00:06.001 --> 02:00:10.680
I was into it and evidently she had rabies on one of her friends sizes.

2011
02:00:11.710 --> 02:00:13.980
Um,
all right.
So they got all these different fucking websites here.

2012
02:00:13.981 --> 02:00:16.260
10 most bizarre dating websites.

2013
02:00:16.380 --> 02:00:20.670
I feel like I should have Anton fig here right now to do a little drum roll.
Um,

2014
02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:26.580
they have a website for lookalikes,
people who look like each other,

2015
02:00:26.581 --> 02:00:28.710
which I think is awesome.
You know,

2016
02:00:28.711 --> 02:00:33.300
a couple of narcissists just get together and uh,
they don't have a day.
You know,

2017
02:00:33.630 --> 02:00:35.970
neither one of them has a problem with the other person is saying,

2018
02:00:35.971 --> 02:00:37.230
I need a little me time.

2019
02:00:37.850 --> 02:00:40.140
They're going to have me time together just looking at each other,

2020
02:00:40.141 --> 02:00:42.930
how they look alike.
Um,

2021
02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:48.080
this one basically says a look alike date dating website because that's where

2022
02:00:48.350 --> 02:00:53.130
we're all looking for,
right?
I'm the founder of,
uh,
find your face,

2023
02:00:53.131 --> 02:00:55.470
make.com.
So she,

2024
02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:59.430
she says that she was inspired to build a website after people kept telling her

2025
02:00:59.431 --> 02:01:01.650
that she and her ex husband look a lot alike.

2026
02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:04.260
It's really not a comment compliment then they had,

2027
02:01:04.261 --> 02:01:08.040
they have a website for ugly people.
I swear to God,
uh,

2028
02:01:08.070 --> 02:01:11.700
Britain's first dating agency,
who are the guests.
Britain would have a date,

2029
02:01:11.701 --> 02:01:14.400
a dating website for ugly people.
You know,

2030
02:01:14.401 --> 02:01:17.540
it's not that people in Britain are fucking ugly.
It's that they,

2031
02:01:17.990 --> 02:01:21.210
the country is the size of Michigan.
Uh,
you know,

2032
02:01:22.080 --> 02:01:25.560
Americans are good looking people because we got everybody.
Everybody's fucking,

2033
02:01:25.561 --> 02:01:29.490
everybody.
We were mulching it over.
You've got fresh soil over here.

2034
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:33.300
Goddamn English people.
They've been fucking in the same soil for years.

2035
02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:37.110
Goddamn teeth are all fucked up.
You want to see the worst?

2036
02:01:37.111 --> 02:01:40.430
If I'm looking at the royal family,
is there good looking person?

2037
02:01:40.910 --> 02:01:41.810
<v 6>Fergie.</v>

2038
02:01:43.660 --> 02:01:46.180
Fergie could scare a fucking pug.

2039
02:01:51.460 --> 02:01:52.293
<v 11>Okay.</v>

2040
02:01:52.540 --> 02:01:56.260
<v 6>She could.
She looks like,
I'm like,
I don't know what</v>

2041
02:01:57.990 --> 02:02:02.580
you know if a poodle fucked Helen Keller,
that's what,
that's fucking me.

2042
02:02:02.581 --> 02:02:07.320
That's what you get.
You get Fergie and look at fucking look at Prince Charles.

2043
02:02:09.040 --> 02:02:12.430
Jesus Christ.
You know why his wife was 20 years younger than them?

2044
02:02:12.610 --> 02:02:16.360
Because that's how much further along he had to be intellectually to talk a

2045
02:02:16.690 --> 02:02:21.490
Brady fucking pretty woman in the bed.
Even with a Goddamn Castle,
Prince William.

2046
02:02:23.020 --> 02:02:27.210
I mean they just knocked the teeth that just horrific Harry with those beady

2047
02:02:27.211 --> 02:02:31.980
little eyes,
you know,
he looks like a,

2048
02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:34.680
like one on one of the guys in Dillinger's gang from fuck.

2049
02:02:34.681 --> 02:02:39.681
He looked like they have so just been fucking each other for so goddamn long.

2050
02:02:39.901 --> 02:02:44.610
Like,
Hey,
if you ever look at pictures of people like from 50 years ago,

2051
02:02:45.690 --> 02:02:47.160
you know,
they're probably doesn't work in England.

2052
02:02:47.161 --> 02:02:50.520
They probably look exactly the fucking same cause God knows you guys are still

2053
02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:54.690
fucking trying to empty that keg of DNA over there,
right?

2054
02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:55.920
But over here in America,

2055
02:02:55.921 --> 02:02:59.820
people look different because we had all these different ethnicities came in and

2056
02:02:59.821 --> 02:03:02.430
then everybody,
like people look really ethnic.

2057
02:03:02.760 --> 02:03:06.480
Like if you look at pictures of Americans and like the 20s at Italian people

2058
02:03:06.481 --> 02:03:08.970
looked Italian,
French people look French.

2059
02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:10.770
You could tell what country people were from.

2060
02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:14.070
And then by the 60s right after world war two,

2061
02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:18.240
everybody came back and just started fucking banging away.
Okay.

2062
02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:23.390
The greatest generation basically from their balls came the deuce generation

2063
02:03:24.961 --> 02:03:29.610
known as the baby boomers,
the whining,
crying,
patting yourself on the back.

2064
02:03:30.120 --> 02:03:32.760
Conti is most selfish self,

2065
02:03:33.270 --> 02:03:35.280
righteous generation we've ever fucking had.

2066
02:03:35.790 --> 02:03:39.690
They take credit for all the good shit and completely ignore that.

2067
02:03:39.691 --> 02:03:41.550
They're all a bunch of bank or cons.
Now,

2068
02:03:41.551 --> 02:03:45.750
driving fucking convertible BMWs right through the 80s right?

2069
02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:47.400
Right into AI g,

2070
02:03:47.401 --> 02:03:51.540
all those fucking people and they all claim they were at Woodstock and they

2071
02:03:51.541 --> 02:03:54.990
protested the fucking war.
Fuck all of them.
All right.

2072
02:03:54.991 --> 02:03:57.690
This is a night lot of generalities here.
So anyways,

2073
02:03:58.260 --> 02:04:02.910
but if you notice those people,
they they uh,
they look different.
You know,

2074
02:04:03.210 --> 02:04:04.950
I can't remember if my fucking point was,

2075
02:04:06.510 --> 02:04:10.800
I know point was it's fitting that England started ugly people.com.
Um,

2076
02:04:10.830 --> 02:04:11.663
what is it called?

2077
02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:16.920
It's called a the ugly,
the ugly bug.

2078
02:04:16.921 --> 02:04:21.750
ball.com.
A dating website.
All right.

2079
02:04:21.810 --> 02:04:24.540
You know,
it's funny,
the last time I said English people were ugly.

2080
02:04:24.541 --> 02:04:28.170
You know who they sent over is one of their good looking people was that chick

2081
02:04:28.171 --> 02:04:31.230
from the uh,
from the spice girls.
You know,

2082
02:04:31.770 --> 02:04:34.610
who in this country would just be the real,
uh,

2083
02:04:35.190 --> 02:04:37.260
the real housewife of uh,

2084
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:40.930
orange county would that awful face lift.

2085
02:04:41.640 --> 02:04:44.760
She looks like a good look in mouse.
That's the best thing I'll give her.

2086
02:04:45.860 --> 02:04:46.231
I'm all right.

2087
02:04:46.231 --> 02:04:50.640
They got a sea captain website for sea captains for women who like guys who

2088
02:04:50.641 --> 02:04:55.590
fucking,
where that Ted Knight fucking a,
I have a yacht hat.
They got that.

2089
02:04:55.710 --> 02:04:57.220
Let me just blow through these.
They got a dead,

2090
02:04:57.420 --> 02:05:00.300
a dating website for a mothers single son.

2091
02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:04.980
Mothers playing matchmakers for their children is probably as old as humanity

2092
02:05:04.981 --> 02:05:08.200
itself.
Ladies,
you can't tell me that's not,

2093
02:05:08.300 --> 02:05:13.140
that's not a major red flag.
Okay.
If there's some mother,

2094
02:05:13.141 --> 02:05:17.080
like the kids got some sort of fucked up relationship that his mother's picking

2095
02:05:17.180 --> 02:05:20.640
that out the pussy,
that he's gonna Bang for the rest of his fucking life.

2096
02:05:20.880 --> 02:05:24.180
Do you think you're ever going to be dressed nice enough?

2097
02:05:24.330 --> 02:05:26.550
Do you think the house is ever going to be need enough?

2098
02:05:26.551 --> 02:05:31.140
Do you think your smores are ever going to taste as good as the wrinkled cunt

2099
02:05:31.141 --> 02:05:34.320
that this guy came out of?
I don't think they are.
So stay away from that website.

2100
02:05:34.321 --> 02:05:38.370
That's my advice for the ladies this week.
A website number five.

2101
02:05:40.590 --> 02:05:45.240
Um,
are you okay?
This one is a s for superheroes and Super Villian villains.

2102
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:48.690
Are you lonely looking for a special someone?
Are you looking,

2103
02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:53.010
are you also okay with tights wearing crime fighters?

2104
02:05:53.640 --> 02:05:56.100
These fucking comic book people hear a bunch of freaks.

2105
02:05:56.850 --> 02:05:59.820
I think that that's what you start off doing when you start off dressing up like

2106
02:05:59.821 --> 02:06:03.390
a superhero.
Eventually you get into that porn where you want to fuck a mascot.

2107
02:06:04.830 --> 02:06:08.160
Um,
dating website for beautiful people.
That's a great one.

2108
02:06:09.300 --> 02:06:09.871
I think that's great.

2109
02:06:09.871 --> 02:06:13.200
I think beautiful people should fuck each other and just make more beautiful

2110
02:06:13.201 --> 02:06:18.090
people,
you know,
give the rest of us something to jerk off to,
you know,

2111
02:06:18.091 --> 02:06:21.270
or maybe something to claim if you go out and make your million when,

2112
02:06:21.271 --> 02:06:25.230
that'd be great.
Um,
dating website for pot smokers.

2113
02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:27.690
Tired of smoking weed alone.

2114
02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:31.620
Tried joining for 20 dating and pack that bowl for two.

2115
02:06:32.230 --> 02:06:35.490
And of course they have some super hot chick with a flat stomach.

2116
02:06:35.630 --> 02:06:39.000
Like she smokes weed.
She's not smoking weed.
She's doing coke.

2117
02:06:39.160 --> 02:06:40.560
That's how she keeps the fucking weight off.

2118
02:06:41.670 --> 02:06:45.060
Can't have a stomach that flat when you fucking eat a whole bag of jacks.

2119
02:06:46.980 --> 02:06:49.590
Um,
dating website for women behind bars,

2120
02:06:49.620 --> 02:06:54.030
dating website for married people,
old geesh.

2121
02:06:54.600 --> 02:06:57.840
Every 20 seconds summons someone.
Somebody new joins.

2122
02:06:57.841 --> 02:07:02.841
Ashley Madison's looking to have a discreet of fair life is short.

2123
02:07:02.910 --> 02:07:07.350
Have an affair with the trademark greeting like that on the homepage.

2124
02:07:07.500 --> 02:07:12.300
You can't say that the Ashley Madison Agency are shy when it comes to the fact

2125
02:07:12.301 --> 02:07:16.380
that they're dating websites caters specifically to married people with the

2126
02:07:16.381 --> 02:07:17.220
roving eye.

2127
02:07:17.940 --> 02:07:22.940
There's even the option to quickly visit a fake home renovation website at any

2128
02:07:22.951 --> 02:07:26.610
moment by pressing a panic button.
Wow.

2129
02:07:27.900 --> 02:07:29.370
Wow.
And then number 10,

2130
02:07:30.030 --> 02:07:35.030
the drum roll from Anton fig is a dating website for people with STDs.

2131
02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:39.250
And it's a picture of two happy people that they're psyched that they both have.

2132
02:07:39.970 --> 02:07:43.810
Uh,

I think I'm out of funny.
Stds,
STDs.
Um,

2133
02:07:43.811 --> 02:07:48.340
connect with singles who share your STD.
That's a slogan from STD match.net.

2134
02:07:48.341 --> 02:07:51.400
Whether you're living with herpes,
HPV,
or anything else.

2135
02:07:51.790 --> 02:07:54.100
Notice how did they take to one scary one,

2136
02:07:54.101 --> 02:07:57.010
one kind of mainstream one and then the,
or anything else.

Um,

So there you go.
There you go.

2138
02:08:03.281 --> 02:08:03.551
People,

2139
02:08:03.551 --> 02:08:06.430
I think I just helped him make a love connection for a lot of you guys out
there.

2140
02:08:07.150 --> 02:08:12.060
Those are all the people you know,
there's somebody for people who smoke weed.

2141
02:08:12.061 --> 02:08:15.450
How about you should have an alcoholics one if you're sick as somebody fucking

2142
02:08:15.870 --> 02:08:17.850
ragged on yet to put down the God damn bottle,

2143
02:08:18.060 --> 02:08:20.190
not for four straight up alcoholics.

2144
02:08:20.191 --> 02:08:23.730
Because if you're straight up alcoholic rights,
you want to end the problem.

2145
02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:25.700
<v 16>Yeah.</v>

2146
02:08:25.700 --> 02:08:28.820
<v 3>But just for somebody with somebody who fucking nags you all the time,
right?</v>

2147
02:08:29.990 --> 02:08:33.260
You don't give a fuck that you have a beer belly.
All right?

2148
02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:38.780
You live for sports and you live for whatever seasonal AOL Sam Adams puts out.

2149
02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:39.771
All right?

2150
02:08:39.771 --> 02:08:44.420
And you want a giant glass and you want to just suck down like fucking 20 of

2151
02:08:44.421 --> 02:08:47.270
them.
And you just want to be able to do that without somebody judging you.

2152
02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:52.070
That'd be a great website.
That really would,
I would enjoy that one.

2153
02:08:52.190 --> 02:08:55.340
God Damn.
And I miss beer.
I really fucking miss that shit.
People.

2154
02:08:55.341 --> 02:08:58.520
I'm coming up on 200 days,
you know,

2155
02:08:58.940 --> 02:09:02.630
vanity vanity wise.
I'm loving it.
You know,
I'm in shape again.

2156
02:09:03.890 --> 02:09:06.260
And,
uh,
I,
uh,
Jesus,

2157
02:09:06.290 --> 02:09:11.290
I was out in fucking a Milwaukee and I was working the PAPP's theater and this

2158
02:09:12.831 --> 02:09:16.820
theater was from like,
uh,
the mid 18 hundreds,
like,

2159
02:09:17.870 --> 02:09:22.490
like Duke Ellington's band.
The original band played there.
Liberace,

2160
02:09:22.690 --> 02:09:25.970
who's from Wisconsin,
he played there.
All these amazing,

2161
02:09:26.690 --> 02:09:28.880
amazing fucking entertainers had played there.

2162
02:09:29.420 --> 02:09:33.530
And I'm sitting there doing my show and I went and phenomenal.
By the way,

2163
02:09:33.531 --> 02:09:37.250
I'm gonna tell you right now,
Milwaukee and Detroit are now in the rotation.

2164
02:09:37.370 --> 02:09:40.070
Without a doubt.
I was blown away by how many people showed up.

2165
02:09:40.071 --> 02:09:43.310
I was really nervous when my guy book both of those cities.

2166
02:09:43.311 --> 02:09:45.170
I didn't know how many people are going to show up.

2167
02:09:45.340 --> 02:09:50.340
I'd never done stand up in Milwaukee and I hadn't done the Royal Oak Theater in

2168
02:09:51.111 --> 02:09:55.700
seven years.
Last time I did there I was on the rich bitch tour,
uh,
with,
uh,

2169
02:09:55.730 --> 02:09:58.130
the Chappelle show tour with Charlie Murphy and Donnell Rawlings.

2170
02:09:58.131 --> 02:10:00.650
I was the first guy out of the gate.
Nobody knew who I was.

2171
02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:04.610
Everybody thought I was a writer on Chappelle show,

2172
02:10:04.611 --> 02:10:07.030
which I wasn't at a,

2173
02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:10.100
or they thought I was from the Detroit Metro area.

2174
02:10:10.340 --> 02:10:13.100
I was just some local white guy that they put on there and that way,
you know.

2175
02:10:13.930 --> 02:10:14.610
<v 6>But anyways,</v>

2176
02:10:14.610 --> 02:10:19.300
I'm ton of people fucking showed up and basically I forgot my point.

2177
02:10:19.810 --> 02:10:24.460
Oh,
I remember I was in Milwaukee and they had some beer that was some local beer

2178
02:10:24.461 --> 02:10:28.000
and I noticed it was a bunch of people from Milwaukee sucking them down and they

2179
02:10:28.001 --> 02:10:29.020
were all saying how good they are.

2180
02:10:29.021 --> 02:10:33.890
And that's one of the things I'd like to do is check out the local breweries and

2181
02:10:33.891 --> 02:10:34.190
now,

2182
02:10:34.190 --> 02:10:38.420
<v 3>man,
that was a fucking rough one to not be able to do that at some point.</v>

2183
02:10:38.421 --> 02:10:41.090
I'm going to end this street though.
Like when Brett Farve finally decided,

2184
02:10:41.091 --> 02:10:43.700
all right,
fuck it.
Well I guess he really didn't.

2185
02:10:43.730 --> 02:10:46.620
Somebody threw him on the ground like a rag doll and he said,
I can't do it.
I no,

2186
02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:48.980
that's how his career ended.
Like cal Ripkin,

2187
02:10:49.010 --> 02:10:53.270
cal Ripken took himself out of the lineup.
I'm going to do that at some point.
Um,

2188
02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:56.090
but anyways,
let's plow ahead here.
Let's get,

2189
02:10:56.091 --> 02:10:59.570
let's get to some of the questions is some of the comments from last week's

2190
02:10:59.571 --> 02:11:01.820
podcast,
somebody that some lady wrote in,

2191
02:11:02.700 --> 02:11:06.470
I was talking about always wear a condom and you can't believe the information

2192
02:11:06.471 --> 02:11:10.460
this lady sends in without anything else.
She goes,

2193
02:11:10.461 --> 02:11:14.750
I'm a nurse and you can actually still get herpes using a condom.

2194
02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:18.080
Just an FYI.
That's it.

2195
02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:23.030
No telling you how you can get herpes by using.
How can you get hurt?

2196
02:11:23.060 --> 02:11:27.080
How can you get a herpes using a condom
if you take a condom,

2197
02:11:27.081 --> 02:11:30.890
you unroll that motherfucker all the way down the shaft of your cock.

2198
02:11:31.700 --> 02:11:36.700
Get it all the way down to the base and it doesn't break and you never dip your

2199
02:11:37.731 --> 02:11:41.350
Dick in pass where the fucking condoms she never ride.
Yeah.

2200
02:11:41.370 --> 02:11:44.330
Nothing drips down on you and nothing.
How does it,

2201
02:11:44.450 --> 02:11:47.990
what does it eat through the rubber.
Okay,

2202
02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:52.040
you're teasing me here lady.
You got me.
I'm on the hook.

2203
02:11:52.410 --> 02:11:54.890
I'm signed up for the sequel for the love of God.

2204
02:11:54.891 --> 02:11:58.340
Tell me how the fuck you can get herpes wearing a god damn condom.
That's,

2205
02:11:58.460 --> 02:12:01.640
that's frightening.
They didn't say that in health class.

2206
02:12:02.750 --> 02:12:05.540
That sounds like some shit.
I never took a health class.
Oh my kid.

2207
02:12:05.900 --> 02:12:10.400
You know what is staggering is I don't know anything about the vagina.

2208
02:12:10.430 --> 02:12:11.690
I don't know anything about it.

2209
02:12:13.520 --> 02:12:16.550
Somebody said cervix the other day and they kept talking about their cervix and

2210
02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:20.300
I don't even know what it was and evidently that's like the swinging saloon door

2211
02:12:20.301 --> 02:12:21.260
that the baby comes out.

2212
02:12:28.010 --> 02:12:29.510
I don't know what ovaries are.

2213
02:12:31.640 --> 02:12:35.300
Aren't there like two of them and that's,
they spit out a couple of eggs.

2214
02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:38.090
I don't know anything about him.
There's a tube in there.

2215
02:12:39.050 --> 02:12:43.010
The eggs come down the tube or one egg comes down the tube and if you don't

2216
02:12:43.011 --> 02:12:43.880
knock it up then it,

2217
02:12:44.130 --> 02:12:48.920
it Kinda just withers up and then just to bloody mess once a month is now works.

2218
02:12:50.990 --> 02:12:54.110
I don't,
I don't know.
Yeah.

2219
02:12:54.860 --> 02:12:58.010
Like if you're ever in an elevator and was stuck and you start having a kid,

2220
02:12:58.011 --> 02:13:00.200
you're in trouble because I don't know anything.

2221
02:13:00.470 --> 02:13:03.050
I don't anything when it wipe out anything when it comes to that shit,

2222
02:13:03.051 --> 02:13:04.670
I never took a fucking health class.

2223
02:13:04.940 --> 02:13:07.850
And for some reason the amount of stuff that fascinates me,

2224
02:13:08.240 --> 02:13:12.890
the reproductive aspects of a vagina don't fascinate me.

2225
02:13:12.891 --> 02:13:15.260
I was just more interested in the,
uh,

2226
02:13:15.980 --> 02:13:18.350
the clitoris and a,

2227
02:13:18.351 --> 02:13:21.800
what do I have to do on the inside to try to make the same reaction happen.

2228
02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:24.980
Other than that,
I was good with the other stuff.
It's kind of like me with cars,

2229
02:13:24.981 --> 02:13:27.950
you know,
I can change the oil change and air filter.

2230
02:13:27.951 --> 02:13:30.890
I can take up the radiator out and replace the pumps.
But you know,

2231
02:13:30.891 --> 02:13:32.960
you start getting in with the Pistons and I don't know shit,

2232
02:13:32.970 --> 02:13:36.180
I don't know anything about it.
Taking that to somebody else.

2233
02:13:37.310 --> 02:13:40.890
I thought she's,
uh,
she's told nerve or stomach here,

2234
02:13:41.790 --> 02:13:45.300
I'll be in the waiting room.
Let me tell you guys that I have no plans.

2235
02:13:45.301 --> 02:13:48.120
If I ever have a kid to be in the fucking delivery room,

2236
02:13:48.660 --> 02:13:52.050
I'm not going to go in there and get yelled at.
You know,

2237
02:13:52.290 --> 02:13:56.070
having some woman break my fucking finger as I'm standing there doing what?

2238
02:13:56.910 --> 02:14:00.240
What am I doing except adding to the heat in the room just by my body

2239
02:14:00.241 --> 02:14:02.010
temperature and the,
I can't do anything.

2240
02:14:02.780 --> 02:14:06.590
Stand in their dress like like a fucking surgeon.
Like I know.

2241
02:14:06.650 --> 02:14:11.080
I don't know anything.
Goddamn pussy guys,
man.

2242
02:14:11.081 --> 02:14:13.930
Just getting talked into one fucking thing after another.

2243
02:14:13.931 --> 02:14:18.280
Back in the day you stood out in the waiting room where you belonged.
Yeah.

2244
02:14:18.281 --> 02:14:21.640
Let's bring somebody else in here.
Somebody else in the year who has germs,

2245
02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:26.560
you know to breathe on the Goddamn kid.
I don't want to see it when it comes out.

2246
02:14:26.561 --> 02:14:30.220
When it's not ready yet,
hose it off.
Slap it around,
make sure everything's fine,

2247
02:14:30.221 --> 02:14:33.100
then bring it out.
Eh,
are you doing their sport?

2248
02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:35.980
Patted on its soft head handouts,

2249
02:14:35.981 --> 02:14:40.090
some cigars and then go up there and wipe the sweat off my wife's brow.

2250
02:14:40.091 --> 02:14:43.750
That's why I wanted to do it.
Old School did.
Evidently if you do that,

2251
02:14:43.751 --> 02:14:47.260
you're the worst first person on the planet.
I can't wait for that to swing back.

2252
02:14:47.860 --> 02:14:51.970
Kind of like with like eggs.
You know,
when I was a kid,

2253
02:14:51.971 --> 02:14:54.460
eggs were healthy and then all of a sudden everybody said,

2254
02:14:54.461 --> 02:14:55.750
all you got to eat as the white stuff.

2255
02:14:55.800 --> 02:14:57.600
You eat the yolk and then all of a sudden that,

2256
02:14:57.601 --> 02:15:00.940
that it gives you a heart attack and then a fucking swung back again.
Oh,
wait,

2257
02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:06.130
the yolks.
Okay.
That's what I'm hoping for.
It's going to swing back again.

2258
02:15:06.250 --> 02:15:09.460
That's when I'll have a kid when I could stand out smoking a fucking cigar,

2259
02:15:10.330 --> 02:15:14.600
you know,
just sitting there with the fucking cigar in my mouth and a.com.
Dot.

2260
02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:16.730
[inaudible] all right.
Why are you here?
What?

2261
02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:22.690
<v 17>Our girl out a girl choir,
right?
Everybody's smoking out Kroger.
I'll cry.</v>

2262
02:15:22.750 --> 02:15:23.583
Don't worry.

2263
02:15:25.190 --> 02:15:25.850
<v 3>Tell I want to do it.</v>

2264
02:15:25.850 --> 02:15:30.350
I know there's a lot of women like you should never be a parent.
Um,

2265
02:15:31.010 --> 02:15:33.290
whatever.
Probably shouldn't.
Okay,
Bill,

2266
02:15:34.460 --> 02:15:37.280
you should come back and check out the Clinton Museum here in Little Rock.

2267
02:15:37.281 --> 02:15:39.920
Oh yeah.
Last week I talked about the Reagan Library and how we had a great time.

2268
02:15:40.170 --> 02:15:44.660
You said Arkansas sucks are only bragging rights are Clinton and Walmart and the

2269
02:15:44.680 --> 02:15:47.780
razorbacks SCC football.
What are you talking about?

2270
02:15:47.990 --> 02:15:52.970
So the Clinton Museum has to be decked out to overcompensate.
Oh,
I see.

2271
02:15:53.150 --> 02:15:57.060
Whenever you come down,
I'll tell you some,
uh,
some more old redneck sangs.

2272
02:15:57.090 --> 02:16:00.530
My friends can take you out hunting.
There's a funny bone down here,

2273
02:16:02.990 --> 02:16:07.760
uh,
to that can be your ticket.
So that could be a ticket.
Little Typo there.
Um,

2274
02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:10.580
you know,
a lot of people are going to take me up on that hunting thing.
Um,

2275
02:16:10.730 --> 02:16:13.720
I just got to figure out who's not a psycho.
I mean that,

2276
02:16:13.850 --> 02:16:16.880
that was pretty well written.
But you're also from Arkansas.

2277
02:16:17.150 --> 02:16:20.150
I guess that's going to be par for the course,
right?

2278
02:16:20.680 --> 02:16:23.180
I don't want to go hunting and Rhode Island.
I want the real deal.

2279
02:16:24.020 --> 02:16:28.650
Arkansas is a good state.
I wonder what do I want to shoot?

2280
02:16:31.030 --> 02:16:33.370
I want to shoot a varmint.
Let me start small.

2281
02:16:34.860 --> 02:16:38.380
I don't want to shoot like a badger or a wolverine.
How about a raccoon

2282
02:16:39.950 --> 02:16:40.783
shooter?
Right in its belly

2283
02:16:44.860 --> 02:16:49.420
possum something fucking ugly.
Uh,
number three.
Hey Bill.
Uh,
as a woman,

2284
02:16:49.421 --> 02:16:51.850
I fucking hate to hear bitches.
Oh,
wait a minute.

2285
02:16:51.851 --> 02:16:53.650
I'm supposed to do on my catchphrases this week.

2286
02:16:54.220 --> 02:16:55.410
People gave me some catch phrases.

2287
02:16:55.411 --> 02:16:57.160
Let me try out a couple of these catch phrases.

2288
02:16:57.790 --> 02:17:00.610
You guys tell me if you like them or not.
Um,

2289
02:17:02.330 --> 02:17:06.860
where the fuck are they?
All right.
Instead of saying get her done,

2290
02:17:07.460 --> 02:17:09.170
you could say got a Prius,

2291
02:17:10.700 --> 02:17:15.050
a comically insane.
That's a catchphrase,

2292
02:17:15.350 --> 02:17:19.910
ginger and loving it.
Securing my perimeter.

2293
02:17:20.120 --> 02:17:23.090
You know what?
That could be the name of a special in the late eighties,

2294
02:17:23.450 --> 02:17:26.720
if I was already a dad and it was talking about having a man cave,

2295
02:17:26.721 --> 02:17:30.950
if I could come out with that before Tim Allen came out with that pegboard and

2296
02:17:30.951 --> 02:17:33.740
did tool time,
I think,
I think I could've made a Zillion,

2297
02:17:34.730 --> 02:17:37.940
I don't read no research necessary.

2298
02:17:38.780 --> 02:17:42.130
Some of these are actually a doable,
oh,

2299
02:17:42.150 --> 02:17:46.100
if I finish a joke after every joke,
I could go on [inaudible] ginger,

2300
02:17:47.120 --> 02:17:50.030
how would you guys like that?
He's a fucking horrific.

2301
02:17:50.031 --> 02:17:53.240
These are all and your career catch phrases.

2302
02:17:54.050 --> 02:17:57.450
You just got billed.
Burned.
All right,

2303
02:17:57.500 --> 02:18:00.890
I'm going to Puke if I read any more of these.
Um,
alright,
let's plow ahead here.

2304
02:18:01.670 --> 02:18:02.690
Um,
bill is a woman.

2305
02:18:02.691 --> 02:18:06.800
I fucking hate to hear bitches complain about being stay at home,
a stay at home.

2306
02:18:06.801 --> 02:18:10.700
Mom,
are you kidding me?
It will be the greatest gig ever.
I get to garden,
Cook,

2307
02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:14.060
go shopping,
watch Netflix all day.
But mostly,

2308
02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:15.920
I can't believe this is written by a woman,

2309
02:18:15.921 --> 02:18:20.030
but mostly not have to get up and work at 7:00 AM every fucking day and work

2310
02:18:20.031 --> 02:18:21.950
with a bunch of bitches that I can't stand.

2311
02:18:22.490 --> 02:18:26.890
Even the Goddamn Jim has a babysitter to watch your spawn while your workout.

2312
02:18:26.930 --> 02:18:28.040
Great Point.

2313
02:18:28.820 --> 02:18:32.000
Then you go meet your girlfriends for three Martini lunch,

2314
02:18:32.300 --> 02:18:33.890
then run by whole foods,

2315
02:18:33.891 --> 02:18:37.640
foods in the liquor store and go home and fix a gin and tonic while you get

2316
02:18:37.641 --> 02:18:41.690
dinner ready and then give your man some hot,
steamy sex when he gets home.

2317
02:18:42.500 --> 02:18:46.550
Is it that hard to push a baby carriage around and then let that thing suck on

2318
02:18:46.551 --> 02:18:51.080
your team every once in awhile?
No,
it can't be.
I am not a mom,

2319
02:18:51.081 --> 02:18:54.980
but I have a dog.
That's hilarious.
I was gonna say,
this sounds like a guy.

2320
02:18:54.981 --> 02:18:56.440
I can't believe a woman wrote this.
Um,

2321
02:18:56.510 --> 02:18:58.580
I just completely agree with you on this subject.

2322
02:18:58.581 --> 02:19:03.170
Quit whining and learn and learn how to keep your legs shut if he can handle it.

2323
02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:07.580
Anyways,
I love the podcast.
Thanks for doing it.
Come to Louisiana soon please.

2324
02:19:07.610 --> 02:19:11.570
I'm planning on it in the fall for an Lsu game.
So there you go ladies.

2325
02:19:11.960 --> 02:19:15.590
That's coming from one year old,
a sellout,

2326
02:19:16.520 --> 02:19:19.580
you might say,
all right,
let's get to advice here and then I got,

2327
02:19:19.581 --> 02:19:21.340
I gotta wrap this shit up really quickly.

2328
02:19:22.250 --> 02:19:23.083
<v 8>Uh,</v>

2329
02:19:24.350 --> 02:19:28.670
<v 3>wait,
can you please keep Trev with the puppet?
The um,
oh by the way,
you guys,</v>

2330
02:19:28.671 --> 02:19:29.660
why don't you guys vote on the,

2331
02:19:29.661 --> 02:19:34.550
on your catch phrase and I'll say it once next week when I do the whatever funny

2332
02:19:34.551 --> 02:19:39.380
joke you want me to say.
Got a Prius.
Like get her done.
Get a Prius.

2333
02:19:40.200 --> 02:19:43.790
You like that?
Do you want me to say ginger and loving it?

2334
02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:49.010
Securing my perimeter or a what was the last one?

2335
02:19:50.180 --> 02:19:54.160
Ah,
ginger vote on the Mlm,

2336
02:19:54.161 --> 02:19:56.960
podcast.com.
I could have sold those a lot better.
I know.

2337
02:19:56.980 --> 02:20:00.440
I always promise my web guy that I'm going to sell this shit better.
And I just,

2338
02:20:00.441 --> 02:20:02.570
you know,
what is this podcast,
the stream of consciousness.

2339
02:20:02.571 --> 02:20:05.300
So if I try and plan shit,
it ends up not being funny.

2340
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:06.920
Let's get to the advice here,

2341
02:20:07.780 --> 02:20:10.850

2344
02:20:19.040 --> 02:20:23.780
I kind of know what the hell it is.
What is the email?
It's on the MM podcast.com.

2345
02:20:25.270 --> 02:20:28.040
What the fuck is at Jesus Christ?
Why do I try,

2346
02:20:28.850 --> 02:20:31.700
why do I get my web guy right now is just throwing his hands up in the fucking

2347
02:20:31.701 --> 02:20:34.940
air and that's what he's saying.
Why do I try to help this guy?

2348
02:20:36.050 --> 02:20:40.510
This is pointless.
Thank God for the donation button.
Um,

2349
02:20:40.610 --> 02:20:43.550
anyways,
advice for the week.
Uh,
I haven't read any of these.

2350
02:20:43.940 --> 02:20:46.100
Whatever I flew today,
people go fuck yourselves.

2351
02:20:46.580 --> 02:20:50.270
I haven't read any of these Salami.
Uh,
let me blow through this.
Um,

2352
02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:53.840
it by advice.
You know what I should've done?

2353
02:20:53.841 --> 02:20:56.750
I should've got a joke book and just read bad jokes and then,

2354
02:20:56.780 --> 02:21:00.750
then tried out the fucking catchphrases.
That's what I should've done.
God dammit.

2355
02:21:01.530 --> 02:21:03.560
All right.
Advice bills.
Since you've,
uh,

2356
02:21:03.561 --> 02:21:05.990
you've given great advice and relationships in the past the morning.

2357
02:21:05.991 --> 02:21:08.270
If he can do it for me.
I've been with this girl,

2358
02:21:08.271 --> 02:21:12.860
this lady of mine for years and we're planning on getting married.
Oh,

2359
02:21:13.430 --> 02:21:15.860
Geez.
Uh,
we're both only 20 years old.

2360
02:21:15.890 --> 02:21:19.850
I'm a college dropout since I'm certainly a more blue collar individual.

2361
02:21:20.240 --> 02:21:24.890
She is going to college to work with children.
We both work full time jobs,

2362
02:21:25.210 --> 02:21:27.020
mind being the night shift in a warehouse,

2363
02:21:27.021 --> 02:21:30.230
selecting orders to go to individual stores,

2364
02:21:30.260 --> 02:21:33.470
stressful and physically challenging.
Uh,

2365
02:21:33.500 --> 02:21:36.920
here's being her as being a phone,

2366
02:21:36.921 --> 02:21:38.840
answering day job from eight to five,

2367
02:21:39.050 --> 02:21:43.370
working with customers in a graphic design shop.
Boring and easy.
Okay.

2368
02:21:43.820 --> 02:21:44.451
He's defined.

2369
02:21:44.451 --> 02:21:48.950
His job is stressful and physically challenging and her job is boring and easy.

2370
02:21:48.951 --> 02:21:52.100
Never underestimate how tedious and boring job can be.

2371
02:21:52.430 --> 02:21:56.330
I'd rather do your job walking around breaking balls.

2372
02:21:56.960 --> 02:21:59.180
Look at his fucking shirt,
dude.

2373
02:21:59.181 --> 02:22:03.260
Fucking queer drive by on the fucking forklift,

2374
02:22:03.800 --> 02:22:06.950
right guys,
start a softball league.
You have a great time.

2375
02:22:06.951 --> 02:22:10.760
Rather than sitting there having your ass fall asleep in a cubicle listening to

2376
02:22:10.761 --> 02:22:14.000
people bitch,
cause they can't figure out how to work their,
set it and forget it.

2377
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:16.400
Grass is always greener,
my friend.

2378
02:22:16.700 --> 02:22:19.550
Why don't I shut my fucking pie hole and read the rest of this?
All right.

2379
02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:24.860
Since we started dating,
she seemed to do everything to keep me interested.
Uh,

2380
02:22:24.900 --> 02:22:26.430
make me breakfast in the mornings

2381
02:22:26.430 --> 02:22:27.720
<v 6>on some,
on some days,</v>

2382
02:22:27.870 --> 02:22:32.520
go to concerts with me when she didn't necessarily like the music.
Um,

2383
02:22:32.940 --> 02:22:37.020
the whole works.
But I've noticed that she without shoes,
without question,

2384
02:22:37.320 --> 02:22:39.720
just been lacking in the care department.

2385
02:22:39.721 --> 02:22:43.800
She just sits and watches TV every night and eats and complains about gaining

2386
02:22:43.801 --> 02:22:46.890
weight.
I come home in the morning to do dirty dishes,

2387
02:22:47.070 --> 02:22:50.910
to do the dirty dishes that piled up in the sink from her having friends over

2388
02:22:50.911 --> 02:22:55.230
while I'm at work for the night and get yelled at for not cleaning them.

2389
02:22:55.610 --> 02:23:00.090
Well when I saw them sitting there,
but I had no part in making them dirty dude.

2390
02:23:00.120 --> 02:23:01.680
What the fuck?
You can't have that.

2391
02:23:02.100 --> 02:23:06.300
She leaves clothes laying around every room in the house and that's not even how

2392
02:23:06.960 --> 02:23:08.010
uh,
she is with me.

2393
02:23:08.790 --> 02:23:12.390
She has seemed to develop some kind of self righteousness where everything that

2394
02:23:12.391 --> 02:23:15.450
she wear,
everything that she,

2395
02:23:17.260 --> 02:23:20.680
yeah dude,
I really got to proof read these people.
So many spelling mistakes,

2396
02:23:20.830 --> 02:23:21.663
mistakes.

2397
02:23:22.030 --> 02:23:26.020
She has seemed to develop some kind of self righteousness where everything that

2398
02:23:26.021 --> 02:23:30.400
she says throughout the day should be my main concern and I should go out of my

2399
02:23:30.401 --> 02:23:34.150
way to make her life easier.
I do her college homework.

2400
02:23:34.151 --> 02:23:37.300
I take care of the $2,000 dog I bought for.

2401
02:23:37.570 --> 02:23:39.370
I work on a car when,

2402
02:23:39.640 --> 02:23:43.720
when she nearly runs the damn wheels off the thing and I do chores for her

2403
02:23:43.721 --> 02:23:48.280
family.
She volunteers me for two.

2404
02:23:48.281 --> 02:23:50.890
She has your balls and a little that you know,

2405
02:23:50.891 --> 02:23:54.250
that little engagement ring your butter if you bother yet your balls are in

2406
02:23:54.251 --> 02:23:57.220
there to the next part is the icing on the cake.

2407
02:23:58.330 --> 02:24:03.160
She goes as far as to dictate what time after go to bed and wake up in the

2408
02:24:03.161 --> 02:24:08.030
morning.
Um,
he uh,
evening since I work at nights,
uh,

2409
02:24:08.031 --> 02:24:12.380
what,
what I can and can't spend money on,
who I can hang out with,

2410
02:24:12.381 --> 02:24:17.030
what days I can see friends and require me to call her every time I arrive at

2411
02:24:17.031 --> 02:24:21.110
work in texture in the middle of the night when I get off work and request her

2412
02:24:21.500 --> 02:24:25.310
and I requested to do nothing outside of what she does on her day to day
routine.

2413
02:24:26.270 --> 02:24:27.440
To sum all that up,

2414
02:24:27.470 --> 02:24:32.090
I feel like she's forcing me into a cookie mold guy when I actually let her make

2415
02:24:32.091 --> 02:24:35.600
her own decisions.
Like some strange thing called an adult.

2416
02:24:36.850 --> 02:24:38.570
All right,
I'm going to stop right here dude.

2417
02:24:38.750 --> 02:24:43.230
Cause this is just going to be more fucking misery.
All right.
This is,

2418
02:24:43.231 --> 02:24:46.450
this is what I've said this before on the podcast.
You have to,

2419
02:24:46.451 --> 02:24:49.870
I don't give a fuck how good the woman is that you're with.

2420
02:24:49.871 --> 02:24:54.310
You really have to be careful because all this shit you see on TV where women

2421
02:24:54.400 --> 02:24:55.360
are just constantly,

2422
02:24:55.361 --> 02:25:00.190
there's all this fucking information out there about how guys are assholes to

2423
02:25:00.191 --> 02:25:04.570
women.
There's just reams of it.
And there needs to be,

2424
02:25:04.600 --> 02:25:08.920
because guys are assholes to women.
So women I think are more aware,

2425
02:25:10.420 --> 02:25:13.840
or at least they should be more aware because he got all these fucking goddamn

2426
02:25:13.841 --> 02:25:18.580
shows with either from one to four twats sitting around bitching about guys and

2427
02:25:18.581 --> 02:25:19.570
all this shit that we do.

2428
02:25:20.200 --> 02:25:25.180
But there's no show on TV where you four guys just sitting around a coffee
table,

2429
02:25:25.330 --> 02:25:25.541
you know,

2430
02:25:25.541 --> 02:25:29.890
drinking some hot cocoa with some pillows and wearing sweaters in their favorite

2431
02:25:29.891 --> 02:25:34.420
shoes.
Talking about,
you know,
not losing yourself in a relationship.

2432
02:25:34.421 --> 02:25:38.860
That's what you've done here.
All this shit that she's doing is your fault.

2433
02:25:39.850 --> 02:25:43.120
Okay.
And what's great about being a guy who she can blame the victim,

2434
02:25:43.150 --> 02:25:47.680
which is why we're better problem solvers.
All right?
This is your fault.

2435
02:25:47.980 --> 02:25:51.100
This is all on you.
You don't like any of this shit.

2436
02:25:51.101 --> 02:25:54.940
You have to sit down and talk to her,
okay?
You,
you,

2437
02:25:55.570 --> 02:25:57.100
you're not required to call her.

2438
02:25:57.101 --> 02:26:00.850
You can go to bed when you fucking want to go to bed and you can just sit there

2439
02:26:00.851 --> 02:26:04.780
and tell it you did those dishes.
You clean it up,
okay?
Now,
here's the point.

2440
02:26:04.990 --> 02:26:09.280
This is the key with brides.
This is what you gotta do.

2441
02:26:10.480 --> 02:26:14.170
You can't be mean.
There's no reason to be mean here.

2442
02:26:14.260 --> 02:26:18.430
There's no reason to yell.
There's no reason to be angry,
okay?

2443
02:26:18.460 --> 02:26:22.690
All three of those things is what she wants you to do because the cause,

2444
02:26:22.691 --> 02:26:26.560
she knows she's going to know she's fucking wrong.
If you,
if you,

2445
02:26:27.280 --> 02:26:30.100
if you made the dishes dirty and every day you're telling me to clean them up,

2446
02:26:30.101 --> 02:26:33.250
you treat me like I'm fucking Alison the Goddamn Brady Bunch.

2447
02:26:33.370 --> 02:26:35.080
Everybody knows that that's fucking wrong.

2448
02:26:35.410 --> 02:26:39.760
So what women do when they're fucking wrong is they try to make the argument

2449
02:26:39.761 --> 02:26:44.500
about something else.
All right?
So she's going to do that anyways.

2450
02:26:45.640 --> 02:26:49.060
So,
but you're going to make it easy.
If you're angry and you yell at her.

2451
02:26:49.061 --> 02:26:51.930
And you call her fucking names.
So what you gotta do?
What you gotta.

2452
02:26:52.160 --> 02:26:55.960
You gotta keep,
keep your fucking cool.
That's what you gotta do.

2453
02:26:55.961 --> 02:26:59.770
Keep your fucking cool and say,
listen,
I worked all night.

2454
02:27:00.370 --> 02:27:04.090
I don't think it's fair that you tell me to come home and I have to do these

2455
02:27:04.091 --> 02:27:06.550
dishes.
When you made these dishes dirty yourself,

2456
02:27:06.580 --> 02:27:10.210
I don't think it's fair to me to come home in the morning and have a sink full

2457
02:27:10.211 --> 02:27:14.290
of dirty tissues that not only you,
you and your friends may dirty.

2458
02:27:15.430 --> 02:27:19.540
That's unacceptable to me that you want me to wash those.
That's unacceptable.

2459
02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:23.380
I'm not doing it.
You have to wash those.
I'll wash my dirty dishes.

2460
02:27:23.381 --> 02:27:27.580
I'm not doing that.
All right,
and then,
then let her flip out.

2461
02:27:28.270 --> 02:27:32.260
Let her power.
Let her slam the fucking cabinets.
Let her not fuck you.

2462
02:27:32.980 --> 02:27:37.240
Just don't back down.
Rub One out.
Who gives a fuck?
It's just an urge.

2463
02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:39.310
You've already banged her.
You're not missing anything.

2464
02:27:39.311 --> 02:27:42.370
Who gives a fuck but don't get angry.
All right,

2465
02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:46.270
and then just do due to her what she did to you.

2466
02:27:46.271 --> 02:27:50.080
Just just reclaim that territory.
You're not doing that.

2467
02:27:50.081 --> 02:27:51.940
You're not doing that anymore.
All right.

2468
02:27:51.941 --> 02:27:55.870
Start with the fucking dishes and then start with this.
I know and you know,

2469
02:27:56.770 --> 02:27:59.670
you can actually tag that argument and just say,

2470
02:27:59.770 --> 02:28:01.960
now that we're on this topic of discussing things,

2471
02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:06.100
I'm going to go to bed when I want to go to bed.
I just,

2472
02:28:06.130 --> 02:28:08.500
it makes me feel like a child when you're telling me when to go to bed.

2473
02:28:08.501 --> 02:28:11.470
I know when to go to bed.
All right.
Now that I've air two complaints,

2474
02:28:11.471 --> 02:28:12.550
how about you give me a couple of,

2475
02:28:12.670 --> 02:28:15.370
you got anything you want to say to me and just stay cool.

2476
02:28:15.371 --> 02:28:17.860
Then when she hit you with some shit,
if you don't like it,
tell her,
you know,

2477
02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:20.950
I was going to say to go fuck herself to,
you know,
I don't know what,
whatever.

2478
02:28:22.130 --> 02:28:25.050
Do you know what?
Fuck that last advice.
Just go with the dishes thing first.

2479
02:28:25.051 --> 02:28:28.290
It's unacceptable.
That's it.
If you bring up something else,
then you'd then,

2480
02:28:28.291 --> 02:28:30.660
it looks like you have all this resentful shit and then she'll try and spin it

2481
02:28:30.661 --> 02:28:31.080
like,
yeah,

2482
02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:33.650
<v 3>well if you're feeling all this,
why didn't you fucking say thing cuts?</v>

2483
02:28:33.790 --> 02:28:36.300
You're your con.
That's what's going to happen.

2484
02:28:36.301 --> 02:28:38.940
And then you're going to lose the argument and then next thing you know to make

2485
02:28:38.941 --> 02:28:41.160
up for it,
you're not going to be getting any pussy from her.

2486
02:28:41.161 --> 02:28:43.890
And you can be doing a whole sink full of fucking dishes that you didn't dirty.

2487
02:28:44.700 --> 02:28:48.180
All right,
moving on.
But sir,
you have all the power there.

2488
02:28:48.181 --> 02:28:51.810
Just keep your fucking cool.
All right,
next one and then I gotta wrap this up.

2489
02:28:51.811 --> 02:28:55.770
This podcast is getting way too fucking long lately.
A subject.

2490
02:28:56.550 --> 02:28:59.190
Whose Dick do I have to suck to be a stay at home mom?
Bill Jesus.

2491
02:28:59.300 --> 02:29:03.150
Here's another one,
Bill.
I've been with my girlfriend for a year and a half now.

2492
02:29:03.151 --> 02:29:06.480
I love her to death.
We have a fundamental problem.
I'm a sports nut.

2493
02:29:06.720 --> 02:29:10.230
I watch every single bills game and almost every sabers game.

2494
02:29:10.590 --> 02:29:14.640
I played high school hockey,
college hockey,
and now that I'm in the real world,

2495
02:29:14.940 --> 02:29:16.650
uh,
beer league hockey twice a week.

2496
02:29:16.830 --> 02:29:19.770
My girlfriend who was a good family life with both parents,

2497
02:29:19.771 --> 02:29:22.200
grew up with an older brother that played hockey with an,

2498
02:29:22.530 --> 02:29:27.420
with an entire family that is just as ridiculous of sports fans as I am.

2499
02:29:27.810 --> 02:29:32.280
She is a super,
super girly girl that never got into it.

2500
02:29:32.910 --> 02:29:36.690
And since she was dragged to all of her brothers hockey's games and hated it,

2501
02:29:36.840 --> 02:29:40.650
she now absolutely hates sports in any kinds of sports viewing activity.

2502
02:29:40.680 --> 02:29:43.850
All right.
That's understandable.
This is causing and yeah.

2503
02:29:43.900 --> 02:29:46.150
<v 6>Unbelievable amount of friction lately.</v>

2504
02:29:46.390 --> 02:29:50.610
Now that the honeymoon stage of our relationship is over,
she used to come.
Uh,

2505
02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:53.580
I used to come along to my hockey games,
come with me to,
uh,

2506
02:29:53.710 --> 02:29:57.670
my Superbowl parties and group outings at sports bars on Sundays during the

2507
02:29:57.671 --> 02:29:58.331
football game.

2508
02:29:58.331 --> 02:30:01.810
Now she absolutely refuses to do anything related to sports whatsoever.

2509
02:30:02.050 --> 02:30:03.250
I wouldn't really care that much,

2510
02:30:03.251 --> 02:30:08.070
but I hang out with a ton of other couples and I'm always alone.
Now W uh,

2511
02:30:08.110 --> 02:30:10.120
whenever I want to watch a game

2512
02:30:11.220 --> 02:30:12.330
<v 3>bill,
you're a sports fan.</v>

2513
02:30:12.780 --> 02:30:17.780
It's a lot more fun to watch a game with the other buffalo fans than to watch a,

2514
02:30:18.300 --> 02:30:19.200
to watch it alone.

2515
02:30:20.540 --> 02:30:21.250
<v 18>Yeah.</v>

2516
02:30:21.250 --> 02:30:22.660
<v 6>Uh,
okay.
My brain's tired.</v>

2517
02:30:22.661 --> 02:30:27.661
I'm sorry guys who was there to hear all that shit you spew at the TV when

2518
02:30:28.101 --> 02:30:32.720
you're watching it alone.
Uh,
nobody in my Nia hate sports.

2519
02:30:33.620 --> 02:30:35.540
You know,
she likes going to basketball games.

2520
02:30:35.541 --> 02:30:38.870
She likes going to football games and looking at the field and then she's not

2521
02:30:38.871 --> 02:30:41.920
into it.
So I,
you know,
all right,
dude,

2522
02:30:41.950 --> 02:30:44.380
I already know where you're going with this.
I love this girl.
He says,

2523
02:30:44.381 --> 02:30:46.150
I want to work with it.
We are a perfect fit.

2524
02:30:46.330 --> 02:30:48.610
Every other act I talked to her about the sports thing.

2525
02:30:48.730 --> 02:30:50.440
It's really becoming increasingly a big deal,

2526
02:30:50.441 --> 02:30:54.280
but she would not budge on this whole sports vendetta.
What's,

2527
02:30:54.400 --> 02:30:57.620
as a sports fan do when he finds himself in this situation?
All right,

2528
02:30:57.640 --> 02:31:01.840
well this is what you got to do.
This is a great thing.
Okay.

2529
02:31:01.841 --> 02:31:02.890
When you're in a relationship,

2530
02:31:03.130 --> 02:31:06.560
you do have to have areas that you're into and the other person isn't.

2531
02:31:06.580 --> 02:31:09.640
So you can get the fuck away from each other.
Absence makes the heart fonder.

2532
02:31:10.370 --> 02:31:11.050
All right?

2533
02:31:11.050 --> 02:31:16.000
So what I would do right now is your basically doing to her what her family

2534
02:31:16.001 --> 02:31:18.130
already did,
which is you're not in as bad,

2535
02:31:18.131 --> 02:31:21.480
but you're trying to force into this shit.
She doesn't want to do it.

2536
02:31:21.510 --> 02:31:25.650
She wants to have her own life.
So let her have her own life.
All right.

2537
02:31:25.890 --> 02:31:30.630
And you do your fucking sports thing.
All right.
And uh,
she does her thing.

2538
02:31:30.631 --> 02:31:34.080
You do your thing and then when there's a big game coming up,

2539
02:31:34.260 --> 02:31:36.510
you got to do something that's gonna make it fun for her.

2540
02:31:36.930 --> 02:31:41.070
Either a great to do some other activity with her if she comes to the sports

2541
02:31:41.071 --> 02:31:46.050
thing or you can fucking turn it into like a date night thing is gay is that

2542
02:31:46.051 --> 02:31:48.270
sounds,
um,

2543
02:31:48.450 --> 02:31:53.040
you just have it built around rather than some awful fucking romantic comedy

2544
02:31:53.041 --> 02:31:54.990
movie.
You have it built around the Sabres game.

2545
02:31:55.320 --> 02:31:57.150
You've got to do something to make it fun for her.

2546
02:31:57.151 --> 02:32:01.020
But right now you know what she needs to do.
She needs the detox from sports.

2547
02:32:01.620 --> 02:32:06.150
You just don't force it on her and just find some other activity that you guys

2548
02:32:06.151 --> 02:32:09.180
like doing,
going to the gym or some other shit.
Looking at the fucking ducks.

2549
02:32:09.181 --> 02:32:10.014
I don't know what,

2550
02:32:10.230 --> 02:32:13.590
find something that you guys can do together and then you watch the sports and

2551
02:32:13.591 --> 02:32:16.200
she goes and goes to her needle point fucking class,

2552
02:32:16.201 --> 02:32:18.810
whatever the hell she wants to do.
Maybe that's what you do.

2553
02:32:20.010 --> 02:32:21.060
I can tell you right now,

2554
02:32:21.270 --> 02:32:25.320
all your buddies who's broads are going to them with the fucking games

2555
02:32:25.440 --> 02:32:29.190
eventually are going to be envious of the fact that you can go to a goddamn

2556
02:32:29.610 --> 02:32:32.310
sports bar by yourself and they don't have their ball and chain.

2557
02:32:32.490 --> 02:32:35.560
Cause eventually most of their relationships are going to suck and they're gonna

2558
02:32:35.580 --> 02:32:40.020
want to get a divorce and that they're just going to be miserable,
you know?

2559
02:32:40.170 --> 02:32:44.010
And then they won't communicate and they'll gradually keep getting fatter and

2560
02:32:44.011 --> 02:32:47.850
fatter because they just going to be drowning themselves in appetizers and
beers.

2561
02:32:48.300 --> 02:32:50.880
That's basically what's going to happen.
So you actually have a decent situation.

2562
02:32:51.750 --> 02:32:56.490
Um,
I'm a total sports,
not a Nia hate sports.
She doesn't give a fuck.

2563
02:32:57.060 --> 02:33:02.010
So,
uh,
when she watches reality TV,
I go out and do stand up.
And,
uh,

2564
02:33:02.040 --> 02:33:05.700
when I watch sports,
she goes out,
works out,
it goes out and fucking it goes,

2565
02:33:05.701 --> 02:33:09.360
hangs with her friends or goes in the other room.
That's it.

2566
02:33:09.361 --> 02:33:14.220
And I watch it with my dog and it,
and it's worked out.
So there you go.

2567
02:33:14.280 --> 02:33:17.220
And I think that's it.
I think that's the podcast for this week.
A,

2568
02:33:17.330 --> 02:33:21.000
I've got a couple of youtube videos,
how they make the ice rink.

2569
02:33:21.360 --> 02:33:23.850
They got a couple of good videos like this.
This,
we'll send you to some links.

2570
02:33:23.851 --> 02:33:27.000
How to make a backyard ice rank,
which is something I've always dreamed of doing.

2571
02:33:27.600 --> 02:33:27.841
You know,

2572
02:33:27.841 --> 02:33:30.270
back in the day when I thought I was going to be a dad and have four fucking

2573
02:33:30.271 --> 02:33:33.870
kids,
you know,
three boys and a girl.
I wouldn't,

2574
02:33:33.871 --> 02:33:35.730
I wouldn't let the girls play hockey though.
You know what I mean?

2575
02:33:36.480 --> 02:33:41.070
I wouldn't let him do that.
You know,
I just wouldn't,
it's just too,
uh,

2576
02:33:42.180 --> 02:33:46.380
you know,
if I had a girl,
I,
I,
I'd send her like to,
uh,

2577
02:33:46.950 --> 02:33:49.320
how to make a grilled cheese sandwich like class.
You know,

2578
02:33:49.950 --> 02:33:53.040
I really want to bring back the America that I've read about,
you know,

2579
02:33:54.330 --> 02:33:58.170
the chauvinist stick a fucking with you guys.
Um,
here's another one.

2580
02:33:58.410 --> 02:34:03.230
Eating fish alive.
I don't even know what this one is.
Eating fish alive.

2581
02:34:03.231 --> 02:34:04.640
Is this something about Asia?

2582
02:34:08.020 --> 02:34:11.560
Okay.
There was a fish on a plate and it looks like it's waving.
Like please,

2583
02:34:11.680 --> 02:34:15.550
please,
we'll be back in the water on this chop sticks.
What a surprise.

2584
02:34:16.300 --> 02:34:19.840
Those little dishes you put the thing that is the fucking worst thing I've ever

2585
02:34:19.841 --> 02:34:20.674
seen

2586
02:34:23.630 --> 02:34:25.950
stabbing with the fucking stick you asshole.

2587
02:34:28.470 --> 02:34:29.050
<v 2>Okay.</v>

2588
02:34:29.050 --> 02:34:30.880
<v 6>They just eat the ginger around it.</v>

2589
02:34:35.420 --> 02:34:35.990
You know what,

2590
02:34:35.990 --> 02:34:40.310
what is with the continent of Asia when it comes to animals that you know,

2591
02:34:40.311 --> 02:34:42.260
I know we do cruel shit in this country,

2592
02:34:42.261 --> 02:34:47.180
but they just fucking go above and beyond.
You guys ever see that movie?
The cove?

2593
02:34:47.181 --> 02:34:48.920
I never had the balls to watch it.

2594
02:34:49.870 --> 02:34:53.840
It's basically about Japanese people club and dolphins to death.

2595
02:34:54.830 --> 02:34:56.210
Not all of them,
but just some people.

2596
02:34:56.211 --> 02:34:58.400
I'm not sure saying that Asia is a bad place,
you know,

2597
02:34:58.401 --> 02:35:01.610
look at us with their guns is a lot of shit that we do that's probably fucking

2598
02:35:01.611 --> 02:35:02.444
stupid.
But

2599
02:35:03.640 --> 02:35:06.080
<v 2>how do you,
how do you do that fucking,</v>

2600
02:35:06.490 --> 02:35:08.380
<v 6>I think it's just sitting there and moving.
It's fin.</v>

2601
02:35:10.140 --> 02:35:10.973
<v 2>I Dunno.</v>

2602
02:35:11.630 --> 02:35:13.820
<v 6>By the way,
somebody sent me an email that went above and beyond.</v>

2603
02:35:13.821 --> 02:35:16.830
This is some extra time here on the podcast.
Uh,

2604
02:35:17.060 --> 02:35:21.890
th this one is beyond my advice.
By the way.
This guy basically sent me an email.

2605
02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:26.840
He said,
ah,
I was good friends with this.
This was female.
Uh,

2606
02:35:26.841 --> 02:35:30.020
we've known each other since my freshman year at the University of Blah,
blah,

2607
02:35:30.021 --> 02:35:34.370
blah.
And the year 2000,
we keep in contact.
She's like my kid sister.

2608
02:35:34.730 --> 02:35:37.100
And I thought this was going to be like,
she's like my kid sister,

2609
02:35:37.101 --> 02:35:41.900
but he really had like a crush on her.
Um,
so when you,
but it isn't,
it goes,

2610
02:35:41.901 --> 02:35:46.190
takes a total left turn.
He says,
uh,
we all keep in contact.

2611
02:35:46.191 --> 02:35:47.300
My whole crew or college friends,

2612
02:35:47.301 --> 02:35:51.530
we all keep in contact and we meet as much as possible.
Um,

2613
02:35:51.531 --> 02:35:52.850
the girl who's my kid sister,

2614
02:35:52.851 --> 02:35:57.440
she went to the Peace Corps in 2008 and she got a boyfriend who left the peace

2615
02:35:57.441 --> 02:36:00.080
corps early to be with her.
And this guy says,

2616
02:36:00.081 --> 02:36:02.800
I don't like this guy to put a tersely.
He's done.

2617
02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:05.720
He's done nothing to warrant any antagonism,

2618
02:36:05.960 --> 02:36:07.940
but he's just never set well with me.

2619
02:36:08.330 --> 02:36:13.330
I've kept it to myself because they love quote each other and he has never set a

2620
02:36:13.401 --> 02:36:17.120
foot wrong,
um,
with me or even my friends.

2621
02:36:18.080 --> 02:36:22.610
In fact,
he is overly attentive to her.
I have never seen a my kid,

2622
02:36:22.611 --> 02:36:26.930
sister friend,
they're so attached to her boy to a boyfriend.
Last holiday,

2623
02:36:26.931 --> 02:36:31.880
we all got together and some of us noticed a marked change in my girlfriend.

2624
02:36:31.881 --> 02:36:35.720
My,
I'm trying not to name her name,
let's just call her Lisa.

2625
02:36:36.080 --> 02:36:40.400
Lisa's demeanor.
She's usually very bright,
bubbly,
and vivacious girl.

2626
02:36:40.401 --> 02:36:42.890
A type of girl who wasn't the prettiest in the room,

2627
02:36:42.891 --> 02:36:46.970
but could catch any man's attention with their Cham and personality.

2628
02:36:47.180 --> 02:36:50.870
Now she has an insecure,
negative mopey introverted attitude.

2629
02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:54.500
She marked it down.
Oh,
she,

2630
02:36:54.530 --> 02:36:58.210
she tried to say it was her graduate school stress,
but this was,

2631
02:36:59.080 --> 02:37:01.630
but she was this way for an entire week.
This past Sunday,

2632
02:37:01.631 --> 02:37:06.430
another friend in the group will call her Susie and I were arranging plans in

2633
02:37:06.431 --> 02:37:10.840
late May to go to mobe.
I don't know what the fuck that is.

2634
02:37:10.900 --> 02:37:15.500
And they stated that Lisa and her boyfriend might go.

2635
02:37:15.501 --> 02:37:16.610
Then the bomb came.

2636
02:37:17.300 --> 02:37:21.350
She let it slip that the real reason her boyfriend left the peace corps was

2637
02:37:21.351 --> 02:37:25.970
because he was a teacher and beat up a six year old kid in school.

2638
02:37:26.210 --> 02:37:29.360
He didn't leave the peace corps because of Lisa.

2639
02:37:29.361 --> 02:37:33.200
He left because he was asked to leave.
Um,

2640
02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:38.330
Lisa specifically told the rest not to mention it because of how I uh,
oh to me,

2641
02:37:38.331 --> 02:37:41.840
because how I would react since the incident was a misunderstanding.

2642
02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:45.980
I lived with an abusive father and she knows the story would put them in a bad

2643
02:37:45.981 --> 02:37:48.470
light.
And I realized immediately why didn't like this,

2644
02:37:48.610 --> 02:37:51.680
why there's Douche didn't sit well with me.
You reminded me of my father.

2645
02:37:51.890 --> 02:37:53.240
So it goes on to continue.

2646
02:37:53.241 --> 02:37:57.320
It gets really dark here where basically they think that this guy thinks that

2647
02:37:58.370 --> 02:38:02.150
she's being physically abused or whatever.
Dude,
this is a doctor drew question.

2648
02:38:02.380 --> 02:38:06.440
All right.
This is my advice called doctor drew call love line.

2649
02:38:06.470 --> 02:38:11.470
He will know exactly what the fuck to do if not to send you in the right

2650
02:38:11.991 --> 02:38:15.800
direction.
Uh,
the name of the show is love line.
Uh,

2651
02:38:16.700 --> 02:38:19.880
you can find it and the guy's super famous.
I don't have the link here,
but uh,

2652
02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:24.140
yeah,
guys don't,
don't,
don't ask me questions like that because that is,

2653
02:38:24.380 --> 02:38:27.860
I'll ask the silly ones.
I like sports and she doesn't like,

2654
02:38:28.100 --> 02:38:31.310
but that is above and beyond,
you know,

2655
02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:34.340
this podcast and my ability to answer questions like that,

2656
02:38:34.341 --> 02:38:37.820
I feel fucking horrific.
Uh,
you know,
I,
I mean,

2657
02:38:37.821 --> 02:38:39.980
I say a lot of fucking horrific shit about women on here,

2658
02:38:39.981 --> 02:38:44.090
but I'm obviously just fucking around.
This is all comedy and stuff.
Like,
uh,

2659
02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:48.500
I have no idea how I would approach that,
but,
uh,

2660
02:38:49.910 --> 02:38:52.370
you know,
I,
all I can tell you is that a,

2661
02:38:52.371 --> 02:38:55.250
I've known somebody that was in a situation like that,

2662
02:38:55.280 --> 02:39:00.280
and it's hard when they're in the denial and protecting their Douche of a

2663
02:39:00.591 --> 02:39:02.960
fucking boyfriend and they won't fucking own up to it.
It's,

2664
02:39:02.961 --> 02:39:04.790
it's kind of an impossible

2665
02:39:06.650 --> 02:39:10.490
situation until they finally admit that they got a fucking problem.
Uh,

2666
02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:11.240
so I don't know,

2667
02:39:11.240 --> 02:39:14.990
it's above and beyond me what a fucked up way to end the podcast.

2668
02:39:14.991 --> 02:39:18.140
But I wanted to at least try to send this guy in the right direction because

2669
02:39:18.620 --> 02:39:22.140
that's a,
it was just a creepy fucking email.
So,
uh,
yeah,

2670
02:39:22.290 --> 02:39:24.600
so don't send me the creepy emails everybody.
I,
uh,

2671
02:39:24.601 --> 02:39:27.470
I'm flattered that someone would think that I could possibly know what the fuck

2672
02:39:27.471 --> 02:39:31.790
to do.
They're calling the love line for the serious ones,
the silly,
stupid ones,

2673
02:39:31.791 --> 02:39:35.870
you know,
I love her better.
Clam stinks.
You know,

2674
02:39:36.080 --> 02:39:38.510
those are the ones from me.
So that's the podcast for this week.

2675
02:39:38.511 --> 02:39:41.510
I hope you guys enjoyed it.
We're going to have another podcast this week.

2676
02:39:41.630 --> 02:39:45.770
I'm going to put it up.
Uh,
possibly Tuesday or Wednesday,

2677
02:39:46.790 --> 02:39:49.790
I'll announce it on the MM podcast this week where I actually,

2678
02:39:49.791 --> 02:39:52.730
I'll put it up on Wednesday.
Let's have a defined Wednesday,

2679
02:39:52.910 --> 02:39:57.080
will be a special edition of the Monday morning podcast.

2680
02:39:57.830 --> 02:40:02.690
and I'll have special guests,

Robert Kelly and Joe to Rosa,

2681
02:40:02.720 --> 02:40:06.590
and we're going to be talking about a film,
uh,
in the Tribeca film festival,

2682
02:40:06.591 --> 02:40:09.530
the film called cheat.
We're going to talk about how we all know each other.

2683
02:40:09.531 --> 02:40:12.170
We're gonna tell old stories.
We're going to break each other balls,

2684
02:40:12.380 --> 02:40:14.100
probably trash each other,
and

2685
02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:16.800
<v 3>it might hurt our friendships,
but it's going to be hilarious.
Do you guys,</v>

2686
02:40:16.801 --> 02:40:19.860
I hope you enjoy it.
Go fuck yourselves.
Have a great weekend.
