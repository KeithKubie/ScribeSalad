00:00:00.003 --> 00:00:03.307
We know that when we add to x, we're multiplying the value of f of x, but by

00:00:03.307 --> 00:00:08.666
how much? Well, let's consider the functions we've already looked at. In the

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:13.118
case of f of x equals 2 to the x, f of x was multiplied by 2 whenever x

00:00:13.118 --> 00:00:20.416
increased by 1. Here, 2 is called the growth rate of the function. So what can

00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:24.207
we say about the growth rate of exponential functions in general? Considering

00:00:24.207 --> 00:00:28.093
that general function, f of x, equals a to the x, when we increase x by 1,

00:00:28.093 --> 00:00:31.590
what's going to happen to f of x?
