1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,310
I'm Jad Abumrad Robert Krulwich,

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:06,720
Radiolab or topic today where its
power of words of language. Okay,

3
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:10,830
so Nicaragua 1970s that's where
our next story starts. You with me?

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,390
So imagine you're a kid that's deaf
in Nicaragua at this time, born deaf,

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,070
or are born deaf, born deaf.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,340
You've always been deaf and you're the
only one in your family that's deaf.

7
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,700
So you're in this situation
where everybody's talking,
their mounts are moving,

8
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:27,000
you can't hear it and you don't know
sign language cause no one's taught you.

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,670
There was no deaf school in
Nicaragua than nothing. Okay?

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,520
No deaf education of any
kind. So if you were this kid,

11
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,320
all you've really got are a couple
of gestures, really. Crew gestures.

12
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:39,840
You've worked out to talk
to your family and friends.

13
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,570
But beyond that you're cut off

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,860
Blake Ildefonso, the guy we met
at the beginning of this show,

15
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:50,100
except in Nicaragua in the
70s there were hundreds,

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,880
maybe thousands of these LD
fans. Those really? Yeah.

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,440
But then everything changes in the late
seventies hopes of Mosa who was the wife

18
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:04,290
of the then dictator established a
new school for special education.

19
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,740
I think she had someone in her family
who had a disability, not deafness,

20
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,490
but the school would include deaf people
and that says psychology professor and

21
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:16,140
Singhouse was the first cause. Now
instead of deaf kids scattered about,

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,370
they were together in the same room.

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,600
There were 50 deaf kids in that first
entering class, preschool to sixth grade,

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,900
the late seventies for most of them.

25
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,620
This was the first time they'd ever met
another deaf person before the world was

26
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:34,470
going on around them and everyone was
all talking and they were cut off from

27
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:39,420
that and suddenly for the first time they
were all there and they were what was

28
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:42,810
happening and they were what
there was to talk about,

29
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,520
but they didn't have a way of talking.

30
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,870
These are 50 different kids who'd never
learned a language and had 50 different

31
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:53,210
sets of like rudimentary
gestures that they used to. Wow.

32
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,570
That must have been like 50 people with
50 different ways to try and ask for

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,380
breakfast or say they want to go
outside. I mean nothing was shared.

34
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,840
It's not like the teachers were
using sign in the classroom.

35
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,690
Everything in the classroom was
Spanish, which none of them knew,

36
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,040
copying it into their notebooks.

37
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,710
A lot of it was going right over their
heads who at the beginning things were

38
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:12,240
completely confusing,

39
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,980
but they're riding on the bus for an
hour every day and they're playing out of

40
00:02:15,981 --> 00:02:20,240
recess for an hour every day and they're
getting together at the park and no one

41
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:24,050
knows how it happened. Like maybe one
of the kids who was very charismatic,

42
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,120
he invented a sign for safe ball, then
told it to another kid who was very,

43
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,190
you know, socially active. And that
second kid then spread the sign.

44
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:33,280
However it worked over time,

45
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:38,281
the signs that these 50 kids used
started to converge into a common system.

46
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,740
And when you step back from
it all, what that means,

47
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,770
they created a language

48
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,230
[inaudible]

49
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,010
they, it's, they didn't just
take it from somewhere else,

50
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,780
they couldn't take it from somewhere else.

51
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:01,660
They created own. But how unusual is that?

52
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,360
Like this has happened with
languages all over the world,

53
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:06,490
but not while people were watching it.

54
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:08,950
So you're saying this is the first time
we've been able to watch a language

55
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:10,160
being born? Yeah.

56
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,133
Wow.

57
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,350
And for the last 20 years, that
is what Anne has been doing.

58
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:17,880
She's been going to Nicaragua
to that school and watch it.

59
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,670
So, um, oh, you want to describe that?

60
00:03:22,671 --> 00:03:26,690
So I may have gotten recording of this,
but when you arrive at the school,

61
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,380
the buses come around,

62
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,990
the kids are all screaming and leaning
out the windows and siding to each other

63
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,540
and the kids pile out and they line up
in rows on the basketball court that's in

64
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:43,070
the center of the school yard.
And they all sing the national him

65
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:50,990
[inaudible]

66
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:55,580
and the deaf kids all sign the national
hem and they all have one hand over

67
00:03:55,581 --> 00:04:00,440
their heart and sign with the other
hand while the, the hearing kids sing it

68
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,850
and visited the school for the first
time in 1990 about 10 years after it was

69
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:08,840
formed, she'd been working at the
time with a linguist named Judy Kegel,

70
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,240
studying basic linguists
type stuff. Right.

71
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:14,720
Trying to figure out how the verbs work
and whether they have agreement with

72
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:18,260
their grammatical objects. And along
the way her and a collaborator,

73
00:04:18,261 --> 00:04:23,261
jetty pyres stumbled into something really
surprising about the power of certain

74
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,750
words there to set it up.

75
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,440
When she got there the
first time in two Nicaragua,

76
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,160
those original 50 kids who'd invented
this thing had grown up already.

77
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,300
And there were these younger generations
of kids coming in behind them,

78
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,050
growing up with the language,
using it, inventing new signs.

79
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,060
And at a certain point she got curious
to just compare the original signers,

80
00:04:47,061 --> 00:04:50,990
the older kids to the younger kids.
Yeah. In terms of how they sign,

81
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,740
we show everyone this.

82
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,960
Well, one minute cartoon about
this guy who's trying to fly.

83
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,880
He sees a bird flying and he puts all
these feathers on his body and clouds up

84
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:06,140
to the top of a mountain,
flaps his arm and jumps up

85
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,320
and crashes on the ground.

86
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,490
So she showed deaf kids
of different generations,

87
00:05:13,491 --> 00:05:17,630
this cartoon and asked them pretty
simply to describe what they saw.

88
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,300
Just describe it in sign,
describe the whole story.

89
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,840
The differences were
striking. Um, first of all,

90
00:05:23,841 --> 00:05:27,290
so I'll just show you an example of
each year of vaping. A movie here.

91
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,910
This is a first cohort
signer talking about,

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,100
she got out her laptop
and showed me some video.

93
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:34,830
First of this woman in
her hair, her forties,

94
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:38,730
with dark hair and a colorful tee shirt.
She was one of the original signers.

95
00:05:38,731 --> 00:05:43,620
And when you see older signers like her,
describe this guy who's trying to fly,

96
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,020
it's really spastic.

97
00:05:46,021 --> 00:05:50,060
It's almost like they become the cartoon
and she's flapping her hands just

98
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:54,000
socially. So moving all around,
a lot of full body movements.

99
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,580
She's talking about someone
who's moving in a crazy way.

100
00:05:56,581 --> 00:05:58,010
She's going to be moving in a crazy

101
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,210
way. And then she showed me a
young kid who was about eight,

102
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,133
the backwards cat.

103
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,850
So here's Sylvester and now he talks
about the manner when he described the man

104
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:10,340
jumping and then falling,
it was all in the wrist.

105
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,390
All the movement is now in the
hand and it's a very stylish,

106
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,020
you know, they're trimming these
signs down. But more to the point,

107
00:06:18,021 --> 00:06:22,520
there was one thing she noticed
that was really unexpected,

108
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:26,990
had nothing to do with movement, couldn't
help noticing that they, that people,

109
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:30,950
different people in the community talked
about different things in this story.

110
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,550
The older signers tended to describe all
the events in this story and only the

111
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:39,860
events and the younger kids,

112
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,240
they would talk about the guy's feelings
that this guy was trying to fly,

113
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,260
wanted to fly, but failed
the kids. She says,

114
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:52,370
just seem to be better at
thinking about thinking,

115
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,600
thinking like other people's
thinking. So Anne and Jenny decided,

116
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:00,350
let's take all the different
generations of deaf kids, 40 year olds,

117
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,900
30 year olds, 20 year olds, 10 year olds.

118
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:05,450
Let me test them on how well
they can think about thinking.

119
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,590
So what they did was they showed everybody
a comic strip different from before.

120
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,030
This one was about two brothers.

121
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:15,700
There's a big brother who was playing
with a train and then little brother is

122
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,040
like wanting to play with the training
and the big brother's playing with the

123
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,850
tray and then the big brother puts it
under the bed and goes into the kitchen to

124
00:07:21,851 --> 00:07:22,684
eat a sandwich.

125
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,060
And maybe before he goes, he looks
at the little brother and says, Hey,

126
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,090
don't touch my train, don't touch
it. And then little brother,

127
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,520
while the big brother is out of the room,

128
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,430
takes the train out and
hides it in the toy box.

129
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,070
And then the big brother comes
back and the question is,

130
00:07:37,071 --> 00:07:40,160
where's the big brother going
to go to find this train?

131
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,640
Is he going to look under the bed
or is he gonna look in the toy box?

132
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,760
Well, he's going to look under the bed.
Yep. Because it's as far as he knows,

133
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:50,100
that's where he left it.
Yeah. He didn't see it moved.

134
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,660
And if you ask kids over the age of five,

135
00:07:51,661 --> 00:07:54,300
most of them would say he's going to look
under the bed because that's where he

136
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:57,660
left it. And he doesn't know that
it's been moved to the toy box,

137
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:01,230
but here's the thing. When she asked
the older signers, they would say,

138
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,830
oh look in the toy box. Really
they would pick the wrong one.

139
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,670
These are 35 year olds. 35
year olds would get this wrong.

140
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,000
They would fail this task. Yeah,
seven out of eight she says,

141
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,550
and then all of the younger signers
that we worked with past at this point,

142
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:20,790
she's just confused
like why would this be,

143
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,750
why can't the older people pass
this simple test? You know,

144
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:27,500
that involves thinking about someone
else's thinking, what's going on here.

145
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,990
And then in a career tour you might
have something to do with certain words

146
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:33,030
because the older signers,

147
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:38,010
they don't really have that many
words for the concept of thinking.

148
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:42,310
I mean they have mainly just one
side pointing at your forehead. Yeah.

149
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,760
Basically you just point at your
forehead with your index finger.

150
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,740
By the time you get to the younger kids,

151
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,800
they've got tons of words
for thinking things like,

152
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,350
I know something and I know
that you don't know it.

153
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,550
I know something and I know you do know
it. They've a signed for understand,

154
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:01,770
believe, remember, forget
how many roughly were there?

155
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:05,910
10 or 12 wow. So from 30 years
we go from just a couple,

156
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,410
two of them from like knowing
and not knowing. Right? 12 yeah,

157
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,940
and somehow that makes all the difference.

158
00:09:11,941 --> 00:09:15,000
She says the more of these
think words you've got,

159
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,370
the more you can think. Am I right to
say that you're tiptoeing toward that,

160
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,960
that you maybe you don't
want to go there all the way.

161
00:09:22,190 --> 00:09:26,730
I'm trying to think that I guess I don't
think it's so simple that you could

162
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:27,630
just go in and say, Hey,

163
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:30,870
I'm going to teach you 10 signs today
and now suddenly you're going to have

164
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:32,610
better cognitive capacity.

165
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:37,670
But you are saying though that the verb
think [inaudible] is somehow implicated

166
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,200
in my ability to think
about your thinking. Right.

167
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:45,780
[inaudible]

168
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,280
thinking about thinking,

169
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,570
understanding how other people understand.

170
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,480
That's something that having
language makes you better at.

171
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,010
There are certain words she says that
don't just give you a name for something.

172
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,480
Somehow they give you access to a concept.

173
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:10,220
It would otherwise be really
hard to get or even talk about.

174
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,000
It's really hard to talk about
thoughts without the word thoughts

175
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:20,420
or what does time without the word
time. It's really freaking hard concept.

176
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,790
These words are like breaches.

177
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,990
Somehow they get you to some new mental
place that otherwise you'd be cut off

178
00:10:29,451 --> 00:10:31,010
from. But that's sad though.

179
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:34,460
I mean these young kids have something
that the people who actually invented the

180
00:10:34,461 --> 00:10:36,950
language double, but

181
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,600
you went back two years later,

182
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,210
tested the same people and then suddenly
some of them were performing a lot

183
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:49,240
better than they had the two years
before on the same kinds of tasks.

184
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,860
Do you mean the older signers? Yeah,

185
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:54,310
they were passing suddenly some
of them were passing. Yeah.

186
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,360
Was that what happened? What
happened in the past two years? Yeah.

187
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:03,780
Those younger kids grew up and started
hanging out at the deaf association.

188
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,380
Wait, what? So what had
happened in the mean?

189
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:08,980
So here's the strange
twist of the whole thing.

190
00:11:08,981 --> 00:11:12,550
The Deaf Association is this place where
the older signers would hang out. Yeah.

191
00:11:12,551 --> 00:11:15,790
It's a social club. So they
played chess, do whatever. Well,

192
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:18,790
it has certain point these youngsters
start showing up, you know,

193
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,580
cause they've graduated and they want
to hang out at the deficit association

194
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:25,510
too. But they bring with them
all of their new mental verbs,

195
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:29,140
you know all these words for thinking.
They start using it with the older kids.

196
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:30,070
The older kids pick it up.

197
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,060
Most suddenly these older
kids are now passing the test.

198
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:39,050
So there was learning that took place
in adulthood that actually it gives them

199
00:11:39,051 --> 00:11:43,490
new insight into other people's thinking
and motivation and now they can pass

200
00:11:43,491 --> 00:11:48,230
these tasks. That super interesting
story. It's really cool.

201
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,583
[inaudible] [inaudible]

202
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:03,820
and sank Hass is an associate professor
of psychology at Barnard College in New

203
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,023
York.

204
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,100
Hmm.

205
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,060
The thing, of course you want it, you
wonder is a, once you've gotten these,

206
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,930
this new facility in you, there's,
there's a lot of literature about this.

207
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,510
My fear lady is about this
and Philly's about this. Yeah.

208
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,080
It's about a woman who learns uh,

209
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,220
proper English and she can no longer be
a flower girl and come in and garden.

210
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,210
She's family. Yeah. I guess
it is kind of like this.

211
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,140
You want like member that our program
began with the story of Ildefonso, right,

212
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,003
which we heard from

213
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,870
Susan Scholler Ildefonso who's The guy
who for 27 years had no language at all.

214
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,980
So you kind of wonder,

215
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:41,840
I can tell you that like what happened
to Ildefonso once he got language, right.

216
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:45,320
And after that first breakthrough where
elephants will realize things have named

217
00:12:45,321 --> 00:12:47,000
Susan ended up leaving for a few years.

218
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,970
So let's see, it was a about four
years, I think, four or five.

219
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:55,840
Then she decided to write a
book about him. And so I, um,

220
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,100
I went and found him again and he had
language and I could ask him all kinds of

221
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:00,870
questions.

222
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,930
Were you able then to sit down with him
and ask him about his life and to really

223
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:05,520
get the sort of his biography

224
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,200
somewhat, somewhat one, um,

225
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:12,560
area that everyone wants to know about
is what was it like to be language this,

226
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:16,960
you know, what was going on in his head?
Yeah. And I asked, when I asked him,

227
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:21,850
I asked and he starts telling me that
was the dark time in his life learning

228
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:22,430
language.

229
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:26,920
It's like the lights went on and I tell
him what we know about language and we

230
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:29,830
want to know what it's like not to have
language and he doesn't want to talk

231
00:13:29,831 --> 00:13:30,664
about it.

232
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,520
But there was a day she says when she was
writing the book and she met Ildefonso

233
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:37,340
in a restaurant and there he was
sitting with his brother, Mario,

234
00:13:37,341 --> 00:13:41,780
who she'd never met before and she
quickly learned that Mario also was deaf

235
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,930
and the language lists Billy.

236
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,890
So I was shocked and because
I was so amazed going,

237
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:51,690
I can't believe you have a language
that's brother. That's when, um,

238
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,550
we build upon the son. Well, let, let
me introduce you to some of my friends.

239
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,200
So they get in a car and they drive for
a while. We stopped at this apartment,

240
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:06,201
we walk into this small little room and
there were these six Mexican men doing

241
00:14:06,991 --> 00:14:11,880
this mine routine. Wait, all of these
guys were like Ildefonso used to be,

242
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,020
they had no language.

243
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,140
We're all born deaf and they didn't
know that they were deaf and what,

244
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:19,710
what were they doing? One man would
stand up and he would start miming,

245
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,900
he would just start
acting out a bull fight.

246
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,860
So He'd read the bull and he'd be
charging and then you'd be the matador,

247
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:33,510
and then he'd be somebody in the crowd
watching. And then he would add a detail,

248
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,280
for example, a hatch and they'd swap.

249
00:14:38,281 --> 00:14:42,210
So then another guy would get up to take
over the story and they'd start miming

250
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,820
maybe Mac the matador, describe the hat.

251
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,330
But now the second storyteller
would add a new detail,

252
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,610
like another person with a
pair of glasses or something.

253
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,680
So each one would stand up, take the bull,

254
00:14:55,681 --> 00:14:59,190
fight the same bull fight to a
different point and add a detail.

255
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,920
Exactly, exactly. Oh
my God. In other words,

256
00:15:01,921 --> 00:15:04,680
I would take him maybe 45 minutes to say,

257
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,540
do you remember the time when we were
out of the bull fight and this woman did

258
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,690
such and such? It was like drawing

259
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:15,970
a picture. Well, let me ask you
a pull it all together. Question.

260
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,920
I was about to think that what a
language is, is a great connector.

261
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,440
But this last story makes me wonder,

262
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,740
these are five men really sharing
and connecting on details.

263
00:15:29,921 --> 00:15:34,180
So is the difference that language makes
just efficiency or does it affect your

264
00:15:34,181 --> 00:15:38,800
heart or your whole body of I
can't tell. I'm not sure anymore.

265
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,340
Well, I'll give you
Ildefonso the answer, which

266
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:46,720
when I saw him, um, a couple of
years later after this incident,

267
00:15:46,721 --> 00:15:50,650
I asked him about his friends and he
said he couldn't talk to them anymore.

268
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,060
He wasn't willing to go through that
tedious effort of all the miming anymore.

269
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,920
But the interesting thing that he said
was he can't even think that way anymore.

270
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:04,490
He said he can't think
the way he used to think.

271
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,570
And when I pushed him to ask about what
it was like to be languaged Lis, he,

272
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,020
the closest he ever came to any
kind of an answer was exactly that.

273
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:14,300
I don't know. I don't remember.

274
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:18,700
[inaudible]

275
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,170
I think differently now.

276
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,703
Uh,

277
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,293
[inaudible]

278
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,940
