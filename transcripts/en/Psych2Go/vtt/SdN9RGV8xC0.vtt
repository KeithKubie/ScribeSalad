00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.760
If you've been following the hype

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.320
on all the talk about the differences
between introverts and extroverts,

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.820
you've probably already heard that

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.360
introverts typically prefer quiet environments,

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:24.205
whereas extroverts often enjoy exploring new places

00:00:24.205 --> 00:00:25.940
and meeting new people.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.940
While this is true,
it only remains half truthful

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.240
for those who identify
as highly sensitive extroverts

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.180
*rewiring tape sound*

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.460
Wait, what?

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.760
But aren't introverts
usually the highly sensitive ones?

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.700
Turns out introverts aren't
the only ones who face misconceptions.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.260
So if introverts and extroverts
can both be highly sensitive individuals,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.620
are introverts still the ones
more likely to identify as HSPs?

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.100
Well, according to Dr. Elaine Aron,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.060
author of "The Highly Sensitive Person":

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.300
70% of the HSP population
identify as introverts,

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.340
which leaves 30 percent
who are sensitive extroverts

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.120
Although the percentage of HSP introverts

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.540
definitely outweigh HSP extroverts,

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.420
This only creates space
for harmful labels and stereotypes,

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.700
Such as the belief that

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.820
extroverts only act or behave
in a particular manner.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.020
Whether someone is an introvert or extrovert,

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.680
the following four criteria
is used to determine high sensitivity:

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.960
1, Depth of processing

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.760
2, Overstimulation

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.440
3, Emotional responsiveness and empathy

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.920
4, Sensitive to subtleties

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.420
If you want to learn more about

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.260
how highly sensitive people function,

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.020
check out this video after here.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.240
Although Susan Cain
is known to be the catalyst

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.780
for the big introvert movement,

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.300
Elaine Aron's research on HSPs

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.400
disproves her broad generalizations

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.440
of what being introverted and extroverted means.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.240
In Cain's book "Quiet"

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.960
she describes extroverts as
one who is sociable, gregarious,

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.180
excitable, dominant, light-hearted,
bold and comfortable in the spotlight.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.800
She then describes introverts
as being deep thinkers,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.200
preferring to process slowly,
sensitive to stimuli,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.960
emotionally reactive,
meeting time alone and so forth.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.300
Which, according to Aron are all qualities

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.080
of a highly sensitive person.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.000
But as an HSP extrovert,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.640
she identified with all of those traits.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.780
And if that wasn't contradicting enough,

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.460
her husband, a non-HSP introvert

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.920
wasn't able to fully identify
with these listed qualities.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.800
Confused? We were too.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.840
So, then what differentiates
HSP introverts and extroverts

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.400
from non-HSP introverts and extroverts?

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.140
According to Aron's research,

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.920
she discovered that those who score highly

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.520
on the MBTI tests
with NF or NT temperaments

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.380
usually identify as highly sensitive people.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.980
Meanwhile, fewer HSPs leaned more

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.860
towards the SF and ST temperaments.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.420
F and T stand for feeling and thinking,

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.500
but it's the differences

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.920
between N and S
that contributes to high sensitivity.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.740
The N stands for intuiting
while the S stands for sensing.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.640
Intuitive HSP people are more interested

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.640
in exploring theories and ideas

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.380
whereas sensing non-HSP individuals

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.660
care more about what's real
rather than abstraction.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.440
Hence, they enjoy the stimulation
the physical world provides

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.060
because it's their playground
and where they make meaning.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.240
Meanwhile intuitive folks don't mind

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.580
escaping and living in their imaginations.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.920
So in conclusion, both introverted
and extroverted HSPs

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.520
enjoy alone time, less stimulating environments

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.060
and prefer deep discussions over small talk.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.420
But what differentiates them is that

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.060
HSP extroverts prefer to

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.120
talk about their thoughts and feelings out loud

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.840
rather than writing about them

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.120
And if they spend
too much time in their heads,

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.520
they'll start to grow restless

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.600
and need to explore
the outside world for rejuvenation.
