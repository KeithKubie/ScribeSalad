00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.850
numbers will be F 0 equals 5 and F 1
equals 5 and the Euler's relation in

equals 5 and the Euler's relation in
 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.340
equals 5 and the Euler's relation in
this case will look like this and again

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350

the number 0 that we see here is
 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.170
the number 0 that we see here is
independent of the triangle ization of

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180
independent of the triangle ization of
 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.240
independent of the triangle ization of
the 1 dimensional sphere that i have

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250
the 1 dimensional sphere that i have
 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.480
the 1 dimensional sphere that i have
chosen for example if you have used 7

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490
chosen for example if you have used 7
 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.240
chosen for example if you have used 7
vertices you are forced to use 7 edges

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250
vertices you are forced to use 7 edges
 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.670
vertices you are forced to use 7 edges
too because you want the entire thing to

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680
too because you want the entire thing to
 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.560
too because you want the entire thing to
be a one dimensional sphere which is a

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570
be a one dimensional sphere which is a
 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.890
be a one dimensional sphere which is a
circle so it the Euler's relation in one

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900
circle so it the Euler's relation in one
 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.900
circle so it the Euler's relation in one
dimension is simply saying that F 0

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910
dimension is simply saying that F 0
 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:59.270
dimension is simply saying that F 0
minus F 1 is 0 so let's go even lower

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280
minus F 1 is 0 so let's go even lower
 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.640
minus F 1 is 0 so let's go even lower
and think about zero dimensional spheres

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650
and think about zero dimensional spheres
 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:04.830
and think about zero dimensional spheres
so this is a little bit tricky if you

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840
so this is a little bit tricky if you
 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:06.600
so this is a little bit tricky if you
had never thought about zero dimensional

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610
had never thought about zero dimensional
 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.240
had never thought about zero dimensional
spheres but what is really a sphere a

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250
spheres but what is really a sphere a
 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.659
spheres but what is really a sphere a
sphere is supposed to be the something

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:12.669
sphere is supposed to be the something
 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:15.900
sphere is supposed to be the something
that lives in our space which consists

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910
that lives in our space which consists
 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.230
that lives in our space which consists
of all points that are of the same

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240
of all points that are of the same
 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.110
of all points that are of the same
distance from the origin or whatever

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120
distance from the origin or whatever
 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.200
distance from the origin or whatever
point that you have chosen so the zero

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210
point that you have chosen so the zero
 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.220
point that you have chosen so the zero
dimensional sphere should live in a one

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230
dimensional sphere should live in a one
 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.950
dimensional sphere should live in a one
dimensional space which is line and if I

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960
dimensional space which is line and if I
 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.070
dimensional space which is line and if I
collect all points that are of say

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080
collect all points that are of say
 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.230
collect all points that are of say
distance 1 from the origin then I would

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240
distance 1 from the origin then I would
 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.810
distance 1 from the origin then I would
get exactly two point zero dimensional

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820
get exactly two point zero dimensional
 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.330
get exactly two point zero dimensional
sphere is two point and that's

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340
sphere is two point and that's
 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.730
sphere is two point and that's
well in my sense that's a triangle

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740
well in my sense that's a triangle
 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.409
well in my sense that's a triangle
ladies fear and there is really one

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419
ladies fear and there is really one
 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:48.960
ladies fear and there is really one
number f0 the number of vertices and

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:48.970
number f0 the number of vertices and
 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.480
number f0 the number of vertices and
that number of vertices should be always

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490
that number of vertices should be always
 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.200
that number of vertices should be always
2 so in this case the olders formula

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:55.210
2 so in this case the olders formula
 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.980
2 so in this case the olders formula
will look like at zero equals 2 again

00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:58.990
will look like at zero equals 2 again
 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.060
will look like at zero equals 2 again
that's right

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070
that's right
 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.560
that's right
so I add 2 in dimension zero zero in

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570
so I add 2 in dimension zero zero in
 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.219
so I add 2 in dimension zero zero in
dimension one and two in dimension two

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229
dimension one and two in dimension two
 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:11.159
dimension one and two in dimension two
so we can imagine what would be the next

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169
so we can imagine what would be the next
 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.490
so we can imagine what would be the next
number and say in dimension three what

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500
number and say in dimension three what
 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.580
number and say in dimension three what
is it going to I guess yeah you should

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590
is it going to I guess yeah you should
 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.280
is it going to I guess yeah you should
guess is this gonna oscillate is it

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:20.290
guess is this gonna oscillate is it
 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:22.500
guess is this gonna oscillate is it
gonna go back to zero yes that is a

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510
gonna go back to zero yes that is a
 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.219
gonna go back to zero yes that is a
correct guess and in fact although it's

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:26.229
correct guess and in fact although it's
 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:28.740
correct guess and in fact although it's
hard to imagine three-dimensional

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750
hard to imagine three-dimensional
 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:33.659
hard to imagine three-dimensional
spheres for this particular problem we

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669
spheres for this particular problem we
 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:36.930
spheres for this particular problem we
can actually test it for our favorite

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940
can actually test it for our favorite
 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.140
can actually test it for our favorite
trying to triangulate the three spheres

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150
trying to triangulate the three spheres
 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.450
trying to triangulate the three spheres
because there is a higher dimensional

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:42.460
because there is a higher dimensional
 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.090
because there is a higher dimensional
analog of the tetrahedron so there is

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.100
analog of the tetrahedron so there is
 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.070
analog of the tetrahedron so there is
called a simplex sense there is a

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080
called a simplex sense there is a
 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:49.620
called a simplex sense there is a
simplex in any dimension so if you take

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630
simplex in any dimension so if you take
 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.740
simplex in any dimension so if you take
four points in general position in three

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:52.750
four points in general position in three
 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.650
four points in general position in three
space then you get the tetrahedron and

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660
space then you get the tetrahedron and
 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.980
space then you get the tetrahedron and
analogously if you take five general

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990
analogously if you take five general
 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:01.529
analogously if you take five general
points in four dimensional space then

00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:01.539
points in four dimensional space then
 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:05.730
points in four dimensional space then
you will get a simplex and we can kind

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740
you will get a simplex and we can kind
 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:07.460
you will get a simplex and we can kind
of imagine how it would look like

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:07.470
of imagine how it would look like
 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:11.129
of imagine how it would look like
especially if we force it to live in our

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:11.139
especially if we force it to live in our
 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:14.250
especially if we force it to live in our
familiar three-dimensional space so it

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:14.260
familiar three-dimensional space so it
 

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.990
familiar three-dimensional space so it
will have five vertices and because the

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.000
will have five vertices and because the
 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.020
will have five vertices and because the
five points which lives in four space or

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.030
five points which lives in four space or
 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.620
five points which lives in four space or
in general position every pair of the

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:25.630
in general position every pair of the
 

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.200
in general position every pair of the
vertices will be connected by an edge so

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.210
vertices will be connected by an edge so
 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:30.540
vertices will be connected by an edge so
that's how the set of edges are four

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:30.550
that's how the set of edges are four
 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.290
that's how the set of edges are four
dimensional simplex will look like if I

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300

for collection of the five points will
 

00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:55.800
for collection of the five points will
form a tetrahedral face of that simplex

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:19.870
the number of bases then you always see
 

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:21.960
the number of bases then you always see
this symmetry but from all these

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:21.970
this symmetry but from all these
 

00:19:21.970 --> 00:19:25.049
this symmetry but from all these
examples that we have executed so far

00:19:25.049 --> 00:19:25.059
examples that we have executed so far
 

00:19:25.059 --> 00:19:28.710
examples that we have executed so far
you see another pattern other than

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720
you see another pattern other than
 

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:32.460
you see another pattern other than
symmetry so for example think of this

00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:32.470
symmetry so for example think of this
 

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:35.489
symmetry so for example think of this
particular H vector one four six four

00:19:35.489 --> 00:19:35.499
particular H vector one four six four
 

00:19:35.499 --> 00:19:37.830
particular H vector one four six four
one another thing that's apparent in the

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:37.840
one another thing that's apparent in the
 

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.109
one another thing that's apparent in the
example is that this sequence increases

00:19:42.109 --> 00:19:42.119
example is that this sequence increases
 

00:19:42.119 --> 00:19:46.710
example is that this sequence increases
up to middle one and four is larger and

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720
up to middle one and four is larger and
 

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.139
up to middle one and four is larger and
six is even larger of course you see the

00:19:49.139 --> 00:19:49.149
six is even larger of course you see the
 

00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:51.419
six is even larger of course you see the
same sequence going the other way so

00:19:51.419 --> 00:19:51.429
same sequence going the other way so
 

00:19:51.429 --> 00:19:54.239
same sequence going the other way so
this pattern is called a unimodality so

00:19:54.239 --> 00:19:54.249
this pattern is called a unimodality so
 

00:19:54.249 --> 00:19:57.570
this pattern is called a unimodality so
there is a single mode in the sequence

00:19:57.570 --> 00:19:57.580
there is a single mode in the sequence
 

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.210
there is a single mode in the sequence
which should happen exactly in the

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:00.220
which should happen exactly in the
 

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.960
which should happen exactly in the
middle so say in 17 dimensions if you

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:03.970
middle so say in 17 dimensions if you
 

00:20:03.970 --> 00:20:05.999
middle so say in 17 dimensions if you
pick your favorite triangle ATIS fear

00:20:05.999 --> 00:20:06.009
pick your favorite triangle ATIS fear
 

00:20:06.009 --> 00:20:09.029
pick your favorite triangle ATIS fear
living in that dimension write down the

00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039
living in that dimension write down the
 

00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:14.340
living in that dimension write down the
sequence of H numbers say 17 many of

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:14.350
sequence of H numbers say 17 many of
 

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.560
sequence of H numbers say 17 many of
them then you will see the stencil

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:16.570
them then you will see the stencil
 

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.180
them then you will see the stencil
mobile relation which says that your

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:18.190
mobile relation which says that your
 

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:21.680
mobile relation which says that your
sequence is palindromic but another

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:21.690
sequence is palindromic but another
 

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:26.430
sequence is palindromic but another
pattern that you must see is that it has

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:26.440
pattern that you must see is that it has
 

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.789
pattern that you must see is that it has
a single mode in the middle this happens

00:20:29.789 --> 00:20:29.799
a single mode in the middle this happens
 

00:20:29.799 --> 00:20:33.389
