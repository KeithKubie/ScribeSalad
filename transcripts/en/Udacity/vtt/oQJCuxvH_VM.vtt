00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.320
Let's talk about how we fix that issue. Ginger makes it

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.650
easy to do this. There are two ways, I'll show you the

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.540
way that's simplest first. They've got the syntax for adding a

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.893
pipe and then a filter. There are a couple, there are lots

00:00:13.893 --> 00:00:16.000
of built in features in the Ginger. One of them is

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.330
called escape. So if you say when you print your item, if

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.550
you say pipe escape, it'll actually get escaped. Let's see what

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.200
this looks like in our browser. Now when I reload this page,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.490
the junk is actually getting escaped. And if I

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.420
look at the source code for this page, we can

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.190
see down here that Ginger ran it through an HTML

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.700
escaping function and replaced the less than symbol with ampersand

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.580
less than, and the greater than symbol with ampersand

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.680
greater than. Just like we did in the previous lesson.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.660
And again, you can see that down here with the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.830
h1. But that's not how I prefer to do things

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.950
in any templating language. Because it's a little error prone.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.440
If you forget to put this in, you've got a

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.640
security hole. There is another way around this, however. If

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.870
you go, when you initialize Ginger, if you say this, auto

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.280
escape equals true, Ginger will automatically escape all variable substitutions.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.840
So let's make sure this is still working in our

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.520
browser. I reload this page, trust me I reloaded it,

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.500
nothing changed. If we check our source code, again nothing changed.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.800
We can see it's all skipped properly here. The reason I like

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.970
to do this, is that prevents you from accidentally making a mistake.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.700
It's a lot easier to see that oh, I need to deal

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.850
with this input when it's here, than it is to see a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.380
subtle error or you know, not be able to see it at

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.280
all when a user is trying to hack your website. So I

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.690
always, in every templating language that I use, look for the equivalent

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.700
of auto escape equals two. And so far every one I have used

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.080
has something along this line. Now what if you actually want

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.600
to display the HTML? Well, there is a filter for just

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.750
that. And you can say safe, pipe safe. And so if

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.810
you know the HTML is safe, you can undo it this way,

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.090
and I feel like this is the best way, you to

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.070
opt in to the unsafe way rather than opting in to the

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.960
safe way. So if I save this and we go back

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.740
to our browser and I reload this page, we can see that

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.389
it is rendering unsafely again. But at least this time we

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.930
did it on purpose, we knew what to expect. And you

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.930
do this if you want to you know, sanitize the out

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.360
put a little bit. For example if your building a comment page

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.000
and you want the uses to have some amount of formatting

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.490
but not everything. You can only allow certain things and then

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.730
print it using this filter. But anyways, let's get that out

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.790
of here because we don't, we don't trust our shopping cart users.
