00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.520
These days audiences are sold on a film months,
sometimes years before it�s released.

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.960
A star-studded cast or trailer may win over
skeptics or get people talking, but a well-crafted

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.810
tagline doesn�t just sell tickets � it
could be remembered even more fondly than

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.330
the film it�s attached to.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.480
Here are Screen Rant�s 10 Great Movie Taglines.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.480
I Am Legend

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.949
A true masterpiece of taglines, �The last
man on Earth is not alone� condenses every

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:38.900
one of the movie�s themes into a single
sentence.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.500
Deciding to leave the vampire-esque enemies
of the film off of the theatrical posters

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.690
entirely, and build tension through unsettling
fear of the unknown was the first hint to

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.500
movie fans that I Am Legend would be more
than your average post-apocalyptic story.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.100
Shaun of the Dead

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.519
Many taglines have failed by being too clever
for their own good, but Shaun of the Dead�s

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.469
actually offers an accurate description of
the film.

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:02.130
The horde of stumbling, flesh-eating zombies
mean some gory deaths and plenty of head-smashing,

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:06.880
but the film is less about what you can survive
than who you want to survive beside.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.690
In this case: Shaun�s girlfriend, Liz.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.980
It may look like a horror film, but in the
end, it�s �A Romantic Comedy.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.350
With Zombies.�

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.350
Cocktail

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.830
Not everyone is a fan of puns, and movies
featuring a sly wink or wordplay tend to draw

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.480
more eye-rolls than awards.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.930
But with Cocktail, a tagline managed to offer
a play on words for the ages, while capturing

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.140
the entire movie�s plot, and the spirit
of its bartender hero: �When he pours, he

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.630
reigns.� Cocky yet deadly serious, the implication
that Tom Cruise�s character is less than

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.770
kingly when NOT pouring drinks teases the
film�s overall message, without dropping

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.720
the 1980s attitude.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.320
Quiz Show

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:58.000
Dramatizing the 1950s outrage which saw multiple
TV game shows revealed to be heavily choreographed

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.140
and rigged by producers, the simply-titled
Quiz Show required a tagline that could make

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.040
even a largely-forgotten TV scandal seem like
certified Hollywood intrigue.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.530
The tagline � �Fifty million people watched,
but no one saw a thing� � heightened history

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.379
to the stuff of legend, promising to reveal
how the American people were conned without

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.129
ever noticing.

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:19.120
Jaws 2

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.770
From the unforgettable music to the lasting
fear of the great white shark, the original

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:24.770
Jaws changed movies forever.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.730
But it�s the sequel that managed to immortalize
the film series in a single tagline referencing

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.849
the movie as much as its box office success.

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.849
Audiences had time to let their fear of ANY
body of water subside, before Jaws 2 was released

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.950
three years after the original - �just when
you thought it was safe to go back in the

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.319
water��

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:42.319
Ghostbusters

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.019
Plenty of taglines can work their way into
pop culture, but none are as widespread as

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.329
the classic Ghostbuster catchphrase, �who
you gonna call?� � a question now known

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.319
to people who never even saw the films.

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.379
What makes the tagline even greater is that
it owes its popularity to Ray Parker Jr�s

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:57.750
theme song.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.230
More amazing still, the tagline isn�t even
used in the movie, with the team�s slogan

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.769
actually being �we�re ready to believe
you!�

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.129
The Prestige

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.170
Not every tagline needs to steal the spotlight
from the movie it�s marketing � some are

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.519
simply clever enough to cast the whole film
in a new light.

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.500
For Christopher Nolan�s tale of two rival
magicians in 19th century London, the tagline

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.870
� �are you watching closely?� � makes
perfect sense, spoken multiple times in the

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.870
film.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.459
But when audiences saw the film, they realized
the question applied directly to them, with

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.010
the director dropping more than enough clues
about the final twist along the way.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.629
Repeat viewings are a must, and the tagline
only gets better with age.

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:41.629
Superman

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:45.629
It�s hard to imagine a time before movie
audiences could believe a live-action superhero,

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.629
but when the producers of Superman: The Movie
planned to bring the world�s greatest superhero

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:53.090
to the big screen, they did so against overwhelming
odds.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.650
The tagline met those doubts head on, guaranteeing
they would �believe a man can fly.� Actor

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.151
Christopher Reeve didn�t disappoint, but
if the wire work and special effects used

00:04:03.151 --> 00:04:06.120
to make Superman fly had fallen short of the
tagline, the modern age of superhero films

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.290
may not have happened.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.419
So let�s all count ourselves lucky.

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:10.419
Alien

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:15.299
There�s no explanation needed for why Alien�s
tagline belongs on this list, as Ridley Scott�s

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.550
sci-fi thriller forever changed the movie
genre.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.190
Audiences couldn�t have known what sat inside
the glowing alien eggs seen on the first posters,

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.250
but the tagline was a clear enough warning.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.630
Hinting at the isolation and dread in store,
and a waking nightmare with no one around

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.570
to hear you scream, the tagline is chilling
to this day.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:33.570
The Thing

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.700
Set deep in the isolated dark and cold of
Antarctica, the title and posters for John

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.590
Carpenter�s The Thing didn�t reveal much
of the actual story.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.980
But its warning of an �alien terror,�
and the claim that �man is the warmest place

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.330
to hide� was enough to make any moviegoer�s
skin crawl.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.690
The real significance of the tagline is only
clear to those who have seen the story play

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.570
out, but the sentence is as unsettling � and
brilliantly written � to this very day.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.590
So what do you think of our list?

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.800
