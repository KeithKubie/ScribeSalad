00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.882
So we found for European television that you have 20 milliseconds per frame

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:09.470
update. This is an incredibly small amount of time and isn't even the fastest

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.156
time strived for by games. If you have a CPU running at say 2.8 gigahertz,

00:00:14.156 --> 00:00:19.687
that's 2.8 billion instructions per second. Turning 20 milliseconds, this comes

00:00:19.687 --> 00:00:25.017
out to be 56 million cycles for that single CPU. This sounds sizable, but if

00:00:25.017 --> 00:00:30.231
there are million pixels on the screen, this leaves just 56 cycles per pixel per

00:00:30.231 --> 00:00:34.382
frame, not a lot of time. Later in this unit, we'll see that the CPU usually

00:00:34.382 --> 00:00:38.474
takes care of creating and positioning objects in the scene, these objects are

00:00:38.474 --> 00:00:42.504
then sent to a graphics processor which is particularly tuned to graphically

00:00:42.504 --> 00:00:43.283
display them.
