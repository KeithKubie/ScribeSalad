[electronic music]

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.340
&gt;&gt; David Ebershoff: It's a great privilege
to publish Gary Shteyngart's

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.550
third novel. [crowd noises] He's really risen
to the top of the

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.300
literary ranks with this new book easily outshining
his

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.610
last two novels. What's truly remarkable about
Gary is

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.920
that he's accomplished so much while hiding
an unusual

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.920
secret.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.689
&gt;&gt;Gary Shteyngart: I can't read.
[kissy noises]

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:25.689
[music]

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.439
&gt;&gt; Edmund White: He wants me to write a blurb.
I already got it worked

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:39.200
out in my mind. Super Sad thing is a dystopian
novel

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.510
about linear future. And the scary thing is
it's already

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.540
happening. He's our greatest satirist. But
he can also

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.680
write about real feelings like love.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.120
&gt;&gt;Male Interviewer: What did you think of
the ending of the novel?

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.620
&gt;&gt; Edmund White: I haven't gotten that far.
Actually I've only read

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.620
just the beginning.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.310
&gt;&gt;Edmund: Well, here's another homo wild.

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.360
&gt;&gt;Gary: I feel famous; homo famous.
&gt;&gt;Edmund: A famous homo

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.100
&gt;&gt; Gary: So pretty
&gt;&gt;Male Interviewer: He has this big teaching

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.100
position at Columbia.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.130
&gt;&gt;Edmund: Columbia? They let him teach at
Columbia? Oh my God. Think of

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.200
our poor kids.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.119
&gt;&gt;Maria Emmighausen: He's a huge inspiration.
He came from nowhere. And

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.520
he's, you know, still kind of nowhere. But
he knows how

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.930
to work the literary world.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.350
&gt;&gt;Male Interviewer: What was your favorite
class of him?

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.649
&gt;&gt; Maria: I guess his seminar on how to behave
at a Paris review

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:29.649
party.

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.830
&gt;&gt; Gary: Well, you know I do so much prefer
early Ian McEwan to late Ian McEwan Ahem,

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.830
ahem.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.399
&gt;&gt; Students together: Well, I do so much prefer
the early Ian McEwan to late Ian McEwan.

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.290
&gt;&gt;Gary: Not so Jewish
&gt;&gt;Male student: Mu-ha-ha

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.219
&gt;&gt;Gary: No. No, no. Ahem, ahem. It has to
come from deep in heart. Not

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.240
from throat. James Franco, please teach this.
&gt;&gt; James Franco: Ahem, ahem

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.750
&gt;&gt;Gary: See this this is real author. Less
is more.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.380
&gt;&gt;James Franco: Actually haven't read his
new book -- Sad True --

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.259
whatever. But, you know, I don't think he
actually wants

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.550
me to read it. I don't think reading is really
his

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.900
thing.
&gt;&gt; Gary: The. The. The girl.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.500
&gt;&gt; James Franco: Yeah, we got that one.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.140
&gt;&gt; Gary: So.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.209
&gt;&gt; Gary: It's never going to be easy. Because
this is Socratic

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.180
method. This is, you know, inquiry.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.540
&gt;&gt; James Franco: What he really wants to do
is cash in on the whole

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.549
Hollywood vampire thing. Like, but, you know,
we're

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.180
going to do like this werewolf thing but they're
not

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.010
wolves. They're bears. Like were-bears.
&gt;&gt;Gary: Grrrrrrrr

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.870
&gt;&gt;David Ebershoff: Working with Gary has been
a singular experience.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.530
&gt;&gt; Male Interviewer: Because of his voice
and his style?

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.580
&gt;&gt; David Ebershoff: No. Because he demands
his advance be paid entirely in smoked meat,

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.360
pickled tomatoes, and three recently graduated
débutantes from Mount Holyoke.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.060
&gt;&gt; Mary Gaitskill: Not that I'm bitter because
I love Gary.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.300
&gt;&gt; Gary: Women can be writer, too, huh.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.580
&gt;&gt; Mary Gaitskill: We try.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.580
&gt;&gt; Gary: You try.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.650
&gt;&gt; Mary Gaitskill: No. Our brain, you know,
we just try so hard to

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.230
separate our brain from, you know.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.230
&gt;&gt;Gary: Yes.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.250
&gt;&gt;Mary Gaitskill: But let's face it. The only
reason Gary gets

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.840
published is because he's so good looking.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.040
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey Eugenides: At some point in college
he took some mushrooms. Some

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.829
kind of hallucinogenic and had a vision that
he was

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.159
actually an immigrant from Russia. So he began
writing

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.090
from that point of view, you know, imagine
what his

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.750
parents would be like. Started having an accent.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.479
&gt;&gt; Gary: Such a good boy. Oh. Eat. Eat turkey.

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:42.239
&gt;&gt; Edmund: You know what you're like? You're
like lady with a lap dog from the Chekhov

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:43.239
story

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.239
&gt;&gt;Gary: Who?

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.989
&gt;&gt; Edmund: Chekhov story.
&gt;&gt;Gary: Guy from Star Trek writes stories?

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.930
&gt;&gt; Jeffrey: Gary has managed to escape the
anxiety of influence by

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.859
the sheer fact that he has never read a word.

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.030
&gt;&gt; Male Interviewer: That must be very empowering.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.840
&gt;&gt;Jeffrey: I would think so. I really admire
that state of pure

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.840
ignorance.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.840
&gt;&gt; Gary: You try to escape.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.519
&gt;&gt; Gary: Oh, no. Oh, yeah. Gary.
&gt;&gt;McInerney: Gary

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.420
&gt;&gt;Gary: McInerney. Thanks God you're here.
I'm having babe

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.420
problems.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.569
&gt;&gt;McInerney: Oh. Don't worry. This happens
to me all the time.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.560
&gt;&gt;Gary: It does?
&gt;&gt; McInerney: Vassar or Mount Holyoke?

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.980
&gt;&gt;Gary: Mount Goalie-yoke
&gt;&gt;McInerney: Hey, girls meet the author. With

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.530
his roots deep in Russian
literature Shteyngart has become an important

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.650
and
indispensable American writer. Super Sad True

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.530
Sexy Love Story
shows him in his smart, soulful and hilarious

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.630
best.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.730
[music]

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.840
[Applause].

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:53.750
&gt;&gt;Gary: How do you top that.
[laughter]

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.460
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Hi everyone. Thank you
for coming to today's authors

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.210
at Google talk. I'm really excited to have
Gary

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.650
Shteyngart here with us today. Gary is local
to New York,

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.650
I believe. He's local New York writer. He's
a modern

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.840
day satirist. He's one of the funniest writers
around in

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.590
my opinion. He's also the author of Absurdistan,
The

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:18.190
Russian Débutante's Handbook, and most recently,
Super Sad True

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:23.000
Love Story. He has made -- his books have
made pretty

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.560
much every best of list -- year end wrap up
best of list.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.699
New York times, Washington post. I could go
on and on.

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.789
&gt;&gt; Gary: Please do.

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:36.650
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: And yeah, [giggles] the
New Yorker actually named him one of the

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.580
20 under 40 luminary fiction writers. So I'm
really

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.290
excited to have him here today.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:44.180
&gt;&gt; Gary: It's great to be here.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.830
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: So as people were walking
in, we were showing his book

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.610
trailer for Super Sad True Love Story. And
where did you

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.120
come up with that idea? Is that a common thing?
I've

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.300
never actually seen a book trailer before.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.139
&gt;&gt;Gary: [laughing] I'm proud to say we pioneered
the comical book trailer

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.350
with this thing. James Franco was a student
of mine at

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.410
the Columbian University. And one day I was
at Yaddo

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:13.699
which is a writer's colony up state. And I
was drunk out

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:17.379
of my mind. And the two ideas sort of floated
in my

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:20.479
head. One was illiteracy and the other was
James Franco [laughter] and we

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:25.940
sort of combined the two and I woke up in
the morning I

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.240
started writing the script to this thing.
And then it

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.870
was just a matter of getting everyone else
to

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:32.550
participate. And writers are great hams. Every
writer

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.620
wants to be out there. I didn't have to ask
twice. We

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.419
get Salman but he was out unfortunately.
[laughter]

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:43.830
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: [giggling] And is that
a prerequisite -- is that part of your

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:47.210
writing process -- you have to be hopelessly
drunk to get

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.210
anything done.

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:50.780
&gt;&gt; Gary: It's part of my heritage. [laughs]
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: All right

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.310
&gt;&gt;Gary: Important to be inebriated to get
the juices floating.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:56.000
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Stay true to your roots.
&gt;&gt;Gary: Stay true, yeah

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.629
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So I think several people
in this audience have

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:00.330
actually already read your book
&gt;&gt;Gary: Wow. That's impressive.

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:02.330
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And we actually have the
Extreme

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.960
Reading Book Club joining us from Mountain
View on VC.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.780
You can't see them. They're there; they're
out there.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.909
&gt;&gt;Gary: Really? Good Lord. You guys are high-tech.

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:17.080
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: [giggling] We are. We
are Google. So if -- for those of you --

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.510
in the audience who actually haven't read
the book yet,

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:22.260
do you want to talk about it a little bit
-- give a brief

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.260
synopsis.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.930
&gt;&gt; Gary: Very briefly, it's a a love story
set in the very near

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.069
future when a completely illiterate America
is about to

00:07:29.069 --> 00:07:34.310
fall apart so next Tuesday or so. And it can.
The

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:36.080
previous books I've written have all been
about

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.879
immigrants. Usually immigrants from Russia
which is

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:42.569
where I was born. But in this case, the characters
--

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:46.930
there's two characters – Lenny, who's of
Russian background, and Eunice, who's of Korean

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.669
American background. And the real difference
between the

00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:53.009
two is that Lenny is an immigrant from the
analog age.

00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:55.470
He still reads books. He still cares about
literature very much and

00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:58.639
Eunice is purely digital. All she does is
shop online.

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:01.770
In this future there is no journalism. There's
no

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:04.740
reading. All that's left is this app-arat
which is worn

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.860
as a pendant around your neck. And what it
does is it

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:10.560
automatically ranks you wherever you go. So
let's say I

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.050
walk into a bar in Chelsea, I'm immediately
the 7th

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.800
ugliest man in the room [laughter] but I have
the third best credit

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:19.789
rating or something like that. So you're constantly
being judged wherever you go. And everyone

00:08:19.789 --> 00:08:21.550
tries to
improve their ratings. In fact, when Lenny

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.440
starts going
out with Eunice who's really cute, his rankings

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.680
go up a
lot.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.530
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yeah, so it's all pretty
relative. I mean, you walk

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:31.030
into a room and depending on how many people
are in the

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.470
room, you're stack ranked against them.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.610
&gt;&gt; Gary: Yeah, I mean, that sort of happens
without digital

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:37.310
technology too, but this is just a nice way
to know

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:38.310
exactly where you are. [laughter] Stupid things.

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:43.610
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter Yeah. So I mean, there's
a lot going on here. I

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.000
think, you know, we've got the global teen's
account.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.529
We've got the apparats. The fashion. And even
the

00:08:50.529 --> 00:08:53.610
language. I mean you have a lot of different
acronyms. You have

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.040
JBF for one. [giggles]

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.790
&gt;&gt; Gary: JBF -- it means just butt fucking
you. I knew a very

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.120
young person who kept saying J/K, which means
just

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.120
kidding, I guess.
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: yeah

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.470
&gt;&gt;Gary: So I thought where would this go in
the

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.920
future. And it would be just butt fucking
you.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.890
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And then you have things
like onion jeans it's kind of

00:09:10.890 --> 00:09:14.610
like taking what is --, you know, just like
with fashion

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:21.540
or what is, I guess, soft porn today could
it be completely

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:22.670
normal and mainstream tomorrow.

00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:25.620
&gt;&gt; Gary: Mainstream. Well, what shocked me
about onion skin jeans which are basically

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.170
completely transparent jeans women wear in
the future is

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.610
that two months after this book came out the
New York

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.260
times did an article about the fashion show
in Paris and

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.640
they had completely transparent jeans.
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Of course, yeah.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:40.540
&gt;&gt;Gary: So I'm kind of
the Nostradamus of two months from now. [laughter]

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:42.600
And that's the
problem with writing fiction these days is

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.879
because the
future -- and you guys are creating it obviously

00:09:44.879 --> 00:09:47.269
-- it
moves so fast there's no way one can write

00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:49.351
about the
present. There's no present left. You know,

00:09:49.351 --> 00:09:52.339
I started
this book in 2006. If I had been writing about

00:09:52.339 --> 00:09:53.640
what the
characters would have be about doing they

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:57.519
would have been
on MySpace or something.

00:09:57.519 --> 00:09:58.610
[laughter]

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:04.700
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: You also write about
the collapsing economy. And you

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:08.630
write about the protests going on. And I'm
sure you've

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:11.640
gotten this question a lot. But, you know,
I'm sure

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.250
people are coming with you. You predicted
Occupy Wall

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:17.940
Street, the financial collapse. And I heard
that you

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.570
started writing this book in 2006.

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:23.779
&gt;&gt;Gary: Right. I started in 2006. I'm from
a failed

00:10:23.779 --> 00:10:25.510
empire -- the Soviet Union, so I have a really
good sense

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.459
of when things are going downhill. [laughter]
In fact, every empire

00:10:29.459 --> 00:10:32.769
I come to collapses. The State Department
is trying to

00:10:32.769 --> 00:10:33.769
send me to China.

00:10:33.769 --> 00:10:35.980
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Maybe it's you. Yeah.
Maybe it's wherever you go, yeah.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.329
&gt;&gt; Maybe it's me. It's just me. So when I
started writing it, the idea

00:10:39.329 --> 00:10:42.209
I had was that Lehman brothers and the big
banks would

00:10:42.209 --> 00:10:45.480
collapse and the auto industry would collapse.
By 2008,

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.910
all those things had happened. [chuckles]
So I had to make things

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:51.000
worse and worse and in Super Sad it gets bad
enough that

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.680
basically the whole country gets bought out
by a

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.410
Norwegian hedge-fund in China. So.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.490
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Did you think it would
happen so soon.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.420
&gt;&gt; Gary: I don't think it would happen so
soon. I honestly

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.940
thought it would I had two or three years
before these

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.480
things would come to pass. But that's not
how it works

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.460
these days, you know.
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: yeah

00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:09.870
&gt;&gt; Gary: You know, back in the day, novelists
-- I'm no Tolstoy,

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.540
but when Tolstoy was writing War and Peace
in 1862 a

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.670
horse was a horse and a carriage was a carriage.
He

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.690
could have been writing about 1812, the Napoleonic
wars,

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.850
and still, you know, life had changed obviously.
The

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.500
Industrial Revolution had started, but so
many things were the same.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:26.760
These days, even two or three years makes
a huge

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.230
difference. Tolstoy didn't have to worry about
the

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:30.430
latest killer app, you know.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:36.269
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Yeah. With, I think,
for your two previous novels, you

00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:40.920
had written Russian Jewish characters and
they're both

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.210
male protagonists. And then in this book,
I think, it's your

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:49.709
first love story. It's also your first female
-- one of the

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:54.600
lead characters. With Eunice Park. So how
did you

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.169
decide to write a love story this time.

00:11:56.169 --> 00:11:58.141
&gt;&gt; Gary: Well, I thought that it would be.
One of my

00:11:58.141 --> 00:12:03.450
inspirations was Orwell's 1984. The two big
novels – the great

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:07.070
dystopian novels – obviously are Huxley's
Brave New World and

00:12:07.070 --> 00:12:11.260
Orwell's 1984. In some ways, as a novel of
ideas, Brave New World is

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:17.370
a lot more fascinating. He predicted so many
things. SOMA which is our Valium mixed with

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:20.750
Klonopin
mixed with I don't know what. So much of what

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:24.459
Huxley
predicted came true. Orwell really took Stalin's

00:12:24.459 --> 00:12:30.681
Russia and Stalin's Soviet
Union and took it to 11. But I remember 1984

00:12:30.681 --> 00:12:34.509
a lot more
than I do Brave New World because of the characters

00:12:34.509 --> 00:12:37.040
--
because it's a love story. Winston and Julia

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:39.180
are in love
and there's this society trying to pry them

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:45.529
apart. What
I thought I would do for this book -- they're

00:12:45.529 --> 00:12:47.740
in love,
but there's no need for a big brother because

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:50.329
everyone is
sort of deputized to chronicle their lives

00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:53.180
at all times.
The government doesn't need to spy into your

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:55.329
bedroom ,
because everyone in this society constantly

00:12:55.329 --> 00:12:57.709
updates where they
are, what they're doing, who they're sleeping

00:12:57.709 --> 00:13:01.600
with, what
kind of sex they enjoy. And everywhere you

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:04.840
go these
streams are everywhere around you. I sort

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:08.490
of thought
what would an Orwellian future look like without

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:10.220
the
government actually controlling things.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:15.200
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And what made you decide
to write this from a diary

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.830
and personal memoir kind of standpoint. So
you have

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:21.139
Lenny writing the diary and Eunice -- it's
kind of like

00:13:21.139 --> 00:13:27.390
through her global teens account which is
a mix of e-mail

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.649
and chat and Twitter type messages.

00:13:29.649 --> 00:13:32.589
&gt;&gt; Gary: Yeah, in fact one of the challenges
was because

00:13:32.589 --> 00:13:35.899
Eunice -- well Eunice is one of the smartest
people in

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:38.790
this future, because she can still write in
complete

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:42.170
sentences which is very rare. Lenny calls
her 'my

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:44.870
reluctant sentence monger' because she has
a subject and a

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:50.050
predicate, usually, and he's really impressed
by that. Again it's an

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:53.160
illiterate future, I have to make these characters
somewhat

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:56.320
literate so that the literate audiences in
Brooklyn and

00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.639
Seattle can enjoy this book. [laughter] And
that was tough to do, to

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:03.770
sort of walk that fine line between her being
talking in

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:06.920
this -- what's one acronym. TIMATOV, I think
I'm about to

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.600
openly vomit. [laughter] Between that and
trying to write a

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.300
literary novel -- well, there are a lot of
pitfalls.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.410
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: And what was it like
getting inside her head

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.840
considering you've written male characters
before.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:25.639
&gt;&gt; Gary: So male, so male. [laughter] It was
great. It was actually very

00:14:25.639 --> 00:14:29.019
very liberating to be inside the mind of somebody
who's

00:14:29.019 --> 00:14:32.990
from a different mind set than my own; who's
from a

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.009
different gender obviously, different race,
different --

00:14:36.009 --> 00:14:39.149
the only thing that was -- that felt familiar
to me in

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:41.279
writing the Eunice character was that she
was a daughter

00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:45.910
of immigrants with all the nightmarish stuff
that come packaged

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:49.100
with the crazy parents insisting you should
do this and

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:54.051
that. Even in this future where law isn't
much of a

00:14:54.051 --> 00:14:58.690
career choice. There's only three careers
left -- media,

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:02.300
retail and credit; those are the three careers.
But her mother is still pushing her

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.470
to take the LSAT hoping she'd go to law school.
[laughs]

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:08.380
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: That sounds like Korean.
I'm Korean. I'm from southern California.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.940
I'm you know
it's funny.

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.120
&gt;&gt; Gary: Well then. You're the perfect demographic.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:16.130
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: This sounds really, really
familiar. I mean, aside

00:15:16.130 --> 00:15:17.770
from the abusive father. I didn't have an
abusive

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:18.770
father.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:22.130
&gt;&gt; Gary: You missed out on a lot. Those are
the best. They're

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:24.740
really great motivators. [laughter]
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Oh well. [giggles] That's

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.930
too bad.
&gt;&gt;Gary: Succeed or else. It's really

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.079
funny when I do readings often and couples
come up to

00:15:29.079 --> 00:15:32.329
me -- "I'm Lenny." And the woman is like,
""and I'm

00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:33.329
Eunice."

00:15:33.329 --> 00:15:34.329
[laughter]

00:15:34.329 --> 00:15:37.959
&gt;&gt;Gary: And the Lenny says all she does is
shop online all day

00:15:37.959 --> 00:15:38.959
long.
[laughs]

00:15:38.959 --> 00:15:41.310
&gt;&gt; Gary: And she's like, "yeah, that's what
I do."

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:42.310
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: yeah, that's me

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:46.500
&gt;&gt;Gary: I'm like
you guys are the best. Thank you for existing.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.509
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: And yeah, another book
I read recently was My Korean

00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:50.509
Deli by Ben Ryder Howe.

00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:53.360
&gt;&gt;Gary: I want to see that; I want to read
that. [laughs] I want to stream that.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.820
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: I think that's interesting
because the two books I

00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:00.589
happen to read about the Korean American culture
were written by

00:16:00.589 --> 00:16:04.220
non-Koreans. I thought that was interesting.
I think

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:07.300
you've kind of toed the line from writing
from what you

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.690
know, writing part of your experience and
then also kind

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:16.089
of examining another culture. What did you
find to be

00:16:16.089 --> 00:16:18.529
the benefit of either approach?

00:16:18.529 --> 00:16:21.970
&gt;&gt; Well, I went to Stuyvesant so Koreans [laughs]
I have known all

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:26.199
my life. In fact, most of my best friends
were Koreans

00:16:26.199 --> 00:16:30.380
growing up because of Stuyvesant. And then
my mentor was

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:35.070
Chang-Rae Lee, the Korean American author.
So this isn't a culture I

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:38.870
approach with sort of -- it's one I know well
and I love

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.649
Korea, I love Seoul. I think it's one of the
most

00:16:40.649 --> 00:16:44.910
fascinating cities. I like the confluence
between Soviet Jewish

00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:47.899
families and Korean American families. I think
there's a lot of

00:16:47.899 --> 00:16:52.720
similarity in that both ethnic groups have
experienced a

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.769
horrific 20th century. Both are small groups
within a

00:16:57.769 --> 00:17:01.529
larger context. The Soviet Jews were a small
oppressed

00:17:01.529 --> 00:17:05.470
group within Russia, Ukraine and other places.
Korea was a

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:11.220
once colonized group surrounded by Japan,
parents who are

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:13.960
completely obsessed about academic achievement.
I mean,

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.340
many ethnic groups obviously share that as
well but I think here

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:21.130
there's a particular brand of insanity and
the love of

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.600
cabbage is very important to both people.
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yeah, yes, absolutely

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.640
&gt;&gt;Gary: Although I have to say the
Koreans do a much better job by adding spice

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.640
to it.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.750
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Yeah, kimchi. It's pretty
good. I can't lie.

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:33.020
&gt;&gt;Gary: Kimchi is not bad.
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yeah.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:37.790
You've created an incredibly vivid world with
this novel.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:41.560
And is there anything that you weren't able
to include

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.640
that you had dreamed of.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.820
&gt;&gt; Gary: Sure. Well, I mean, the book kind
of became an

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:49.960
obsession for me because I was starting to
be sucked into

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.860
the technological world. I mean, starting
with Google

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.760
really. I used to do a lot of my research
by going to

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.370
the Slavic section of the New York public
library in

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:03.120
forty-second street where I would catch the
most exotic Uzbek Flus

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.410
and whatnot.

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:05.590
[laughter]

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:10.000
&gt;&gt; Gary: But then when Google came along,
all that stopped. I

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.870
never left my home. I stopped socializing.
[laughter] And so, each

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.180
new layer of the technology -- the iTelephone
-- the

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:22.240
Facebook, follow me on Facebook and Twitter.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.660
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Yeah, I noticed you had
accounts for both.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:29.340
&gt;&gt; Gary: I started Twitter two months ago.
Now I never leave

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:34.830
home. [laughter] So, you know, I notice that
this technology was

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:37.100
taking over my life. It was also making it
difficult to

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:40.950
concentrate on long form texts -- like books.
It's very

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.590
difficult for me to read a 500-page book..

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:43.590
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yeah

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.370
&gt;&gt;Gary: I constantly get books to blurb. I
don't even

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:48.780
read them anymore. I just blurb them. It's
just too hard.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.350
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Are they turning smelly?
Have you noticed that.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:54.280
&gt;&gt; Gary: The smell is the best part; I love
it. Books are like fine wines age very

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:56.000
well. And I have a lot of books from the Soviet
Union

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.920
growing up and they smell terrific. Much better
than

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:05.430
many of the people who sold them to us. So
you know I

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:07.820
notice that my life was changing. Although
I'm not

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.500
exactly in the, you know, what do they call
-- the early

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:14.070
adapters -- I'm always the last adapter. Even
so I

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.560
noticed my life was becoming more online.
That I was

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.030
concerned with things that were very different
than

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:24.640
before. Before I just basically wanted to
find space and

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.300
time to write. But now I was sort of writing
all the

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.570
time, because the moment I walk out of anything
I start

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:35.260
typing on my iPhone. And that makes writing
a book --

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.780
you're thinking, "well, I write all day long.
How is

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.550
this different?" It also makes-- since books
are going

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:45.330
digital -- it makes a different dynamic for
a book. It's

00:19:45.330 --> 00:19:49.550
no longer an object, and to some of us, a
sacred object. It's now a text file. One of

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:52.040
the many text files that's being sent across
the

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:55.020
Internet. So coping with this stuff has been
very

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:59.450
difficult for me. I think most writers fall
into my

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:01.080
camp. There are some writers that are very
excited about

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.040
the technology. But I haven't seen -- what's
interesting

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.340
to me also is I teach at Columbia at the MFA
level and

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:11.530
everyone wants to be a writer there, obviously.
And I

00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:15.380
noticed that a lot of my students do not have
-- the

00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.320
technology is often missing from their work.
So they'll

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.420
have a story where people, you know, people
are out on a

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.350
date and they're not texting their friends
about how the

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:26.060
date is going. To me, that's surprising because
it seems --

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:29.070
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Are they disconnecting?
Are they purposely not

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:30.210
getting smart phones.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.740
&gt;&gt;Gary: I think they have this technology
that there's

00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.320
something sweet about this. They know how
endangered

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.240
their mode of communication is by the new
technology that

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.020
they almost want to go back to the kind of
novel where

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:45.250
people would run to a pay phone and put in
25 cents and

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:47.260
dial their mother which never happens.
[laughter]

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.870
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: There is a recent article
in the times by Pico Iyer about the

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:54.280
joy of quiet. Did you see that? Just about
how with all

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.160
this technology around us, how do we disconnect.
How do

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:00.350
we find those moments of quiet? And even at
Google, we have a training class

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:04.180
called "managing your energy." It's like sleep
more, you

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.760
know, make sure you leave -- you close your
laptop and

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.670
don't check your phone when you roll over
and look at it

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:10.670
first thing in the morning.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:12.540
&gt;&gt; Gary: First thing in the morning, I wake
up three in the

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:17.371
middle of the night and look at it. It's horrible.
The

00:21:17.371 --> 00:21:20.390
only thing I've found I have a little cabin
up state and I go up

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:27.621
there. AT&amp;T will not connect my itelephone
up there. Thanks

00:21:27.621 --> 00:21:29.940
to our country's crummy infrastructure, I'm
able to

00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:33.540
actually [laughter] -- this wouldn't happen
in Korea, believe me.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.400
I'm able to escape the constantly being connected
by

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.400
doing that.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:40.780
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Okay. Has your writing
process changed like before

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.200
and after the technology entered it?

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:47.130
&gt;&gt; Gary: It's gotten worse. I'm -- as I said
-- I'm not able.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.390
A lot of writing is also reading. A lot of
writing is

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:52.450
saying for three hours a day I'm not going
to do anything

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.430
but read a book. And that book -- whatever
it is you're

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:57.370
reading. It could be the classics. It could
be

00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:00.620
something by one of the brilliant young authors
we have

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:05.490
these days. You interact with
it. It becomes part of you. Reading is basically

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:08.890
saying I'm going to leave my own
personality for awhile and enter the consciousness

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:10.770
of
another human being. That's actually pretty

00:22:10.770 --> 00:22:13.580
advanced
technology for being 500 years old or however

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.780
old the
book is. And that's becoming increasingly

00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.710
hard to do to develop
that sense of empathy. Because everything

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.320
is screaming
for my attention. It's like I'm at a party

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.770
where
everyone is saying “hey look at me; look

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:27.770
at me; look at me.” So my
writing is hampered by my lack of sustained

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:31.020
reading. And
that's why going up state and turning -- well

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.960
I can't
turn it off. It just doesn't work. I have

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.750
to go on this
mountain and on top of a bear on top of a

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.570
tree to get any
kind of signal. [laughter] You know. So that's

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.920
been very
instrumental to helping me read which helps

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.920
me write.

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:42.920
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: How often do you do that.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.320
&gt;&gt; Gary: I spent most of the fall up there.
I teach one

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.870
semester at Columbia so this --. The next
four months are going to

00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:51.730
be here in New York. And that's -- not much
is going to

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:55.760
get done -- a lot of distractions. And the
iPhone and

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.680
New York together -- why live?

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.680
[laughter]

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:03.610
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: So I figured we could
probably start taking some

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:06.550
audience questions. So feel free to come up
to the mics

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:07.550
if you have any.

00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:09.270
&gt;&gt; Gary: I'll answer anything.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:13.751
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Hi. Thanks for coming to talk to
us. Really

00:23:13.751 --> 00:23:19.450
appreciate it. I love the book. I bought three
copies

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:20.450
so you're welcome.

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.250
[laughter]
&gt;&gt;Gary: I'm eating steak because of you

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:27.060
&gt;&gt; Male #1: And so, after I read it, I was
like it's a really brilliant

00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.990
book. I went to Amazon. Let's see what other
people had

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.800
to say about it. I think what surprised me
is the comments

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:38.340
often fell into two camps. One camp was "this
book is

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.400
totally unrealistic." I was like kind of misses
the

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.370
point. [laughter] And then there was another
camp which thought it

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:48.310
was supposed to be science fiction. It wasn't
future

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:51.820
looking enough which I also thought missed
the point. I

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:53.961
was kind of wondering if you anticipated either
of those

00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:57.040
things happening and what your reaction to
that was.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:01.660
&gt;&gt; Gary: Sure, that's a good question. You
know, I grew up on science fiction completely.

00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:05.990
Asimov's Science Fiction magazine, that was
my big nerd pleasure

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:10.220
growing up. And I was much more in tune with
technology

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:15.090
than I am right now. I had the first Commodore
64 on the block and the Atari 2600.

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:18.760
Many of you don't even know what this is,
right? The Commodore 64, it was

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:25.650
a big deal back then and the Apple 2E all
this crap. So

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:29.430
I loved -- you know, I loved the idea of science
fiction.

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:31.640
On the other hand, at this point I know nothing
about

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:37.480
science. You know, my Stuyvesant four years
notwithstanding. So I had to hire an intern

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.280
who is very
attractive. People call him the man-tern.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.000
All my female
friends fell in love with him. And the man-tern

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.970
had a science background, [laughter] taught
me all this stuff how a cell becomes a law,

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:52.640
you know. But
the first version I had of this book was much

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.900
more
science fictiony than it is now. And my editor

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.630
at Random
House, who you saw on the screen, said you

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:01.820
don't really
know much about science do you? And it shows.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:04.950
But you do know about heartbreak so write
about that.

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.770
And so,
the book became gradually less science fictiony.

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:10.780
So, and
I'm glad that happened, because in a way it's

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:13.370
writing to
my strengths. But I knew that this book would

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:17.360
be a little
strange to position. Because there is a so-called

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.400
ghetto
called literary fiction. And once your book

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:23.010
is slotted
into that, you're not going to get any sales

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:26.250
at Costco.
It's shocking that this made the times best

00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:29.950
seller list. You
know you really are making your audience.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:34.780
Seattle,
Brooklyn, Portland, parts of Boston. The research

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:38.960
triangle. [laughter] You know, you're limiting
yourself. So, but

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.400
this is a strange kind of hybrid animal because
it does

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:45.460
have some science fictiony elements. And a
lot of

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:49.490
authors have been playing around with this
idea of genre. Jonathan Lethem's Motherless

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:53.850
Brooklyn is a good example.
It's a detective story but it falls more within

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:56.470
the realm
of literary fiction. The problem with literary

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.340
fiction -- don't quote me on this except this
is on

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:04.790
YouTube or whatever -- I find a lot of it
quite dull. I mean it's

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:06.890
great to write about one's parents divorcing
in west

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:09.840
Chester. It's an important topic. [laughter]
And it's great to do

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:13.380
it in some experimental new way. You know
where it's

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:20.430
narrated by the cat, let's say. [laughter]
But I do find that genres

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:24.300
like science fiction and mystery are excellent
in terms

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:26.150
of getting something new across. Thank you
so much.

00:26:26.150 --> 00:26:31.010
&gt;&gt;Gary: And thanks for buying all them books
-- damn. Learn

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:32.210
by his example.
[laughter]

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:35.340
&gt;&gt; Female #1: I also bought your book but
it's on my Kindle. I don't

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.340
know if that's.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.190
&gt;&gt; Gary: Ooh -- snap.
[laughter]

00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:41.670
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I was wondering -- one of the
things I've been

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:44.850
thinking about after reading your book I find
that with

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:49.391
my gadgets, I actually read a lot more fiction
because I

00:26:49.391 --> 00:26:53.500
can download like your New Yorker stories
onto my phone

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:56.180
and read them on the subway and all that.
I'm wondering

00:26:56.180 --> 00:27:00.920
if you think that this -- have your books
about people

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.150
pulling away from reading. If we're caught
sort of in

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:07.300
this zone where our devices are going to become
easier

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:11.090
for us and the industry is going to adapt
so we're more

00:27:11.090 --> 00:27:14.610
connected to reading over time or is this
just downhill.

00:27:14.610 --> 00:27:19.010
&gt;&gt; Gary: Well, the industry is struggling
to adapt quite a bit.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:23.520
I'll give you an example. 2006 when
Absurdistan, my previous book came out, one

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:28.870
percent of all sales were
electronic. This book -- it's about 35 percent.

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:31.890
I
predict the next book will be 50 percent or

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:35.210
more. I'm
not going to stand in front of this incoming

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:37.501
train and
say I'm going to stop this. Because this is

00:27:37.501 --> 00:27:39.760
going to
happen. There's no question about that. At

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.460
least half
of all books, if not more, if not the majority

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:45.240
are going to be read on
devices. So I'm really happy when

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:47.520
people read it on their devices. It's interesting
how

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:50.160
many people come up to me with their iPads
to sign. I sign their iPads. [laughter] They

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:55.350
want me to sign their iPads which I find to
be adorable.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:57.910
A lot of the Eunices have them and the Lennys
will have

00:27:57.910 --> 00:28:02.670
the old books. And I'm fine with both people
you know.

00:28:02.670 --> 00:28:05.980
Now, this is my professor mode -- scientists
show that

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:09.260
reading comprehension off a screen is about
9 to 10 percent less than

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.890
off the printed page. Why is that I don't
know. Is it

00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:16.690
all the distractions a screen presents. I
haven't read using

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:20.420
a Kindle but I do read the New York Times
on my iPhone.

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:23.200
I find that a lot more distracting obviously
than --

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.690
sometimes when I get the actual paper, I realize
just how

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:30.490
deeply I read it. Sunday spent with the Times
is really

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:34.010
an immersive experience. I read sections – I
would never even think of --

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:36.570
automobile -- I don't even know how to drive
[laughter] yet there's

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:39.000
something fascinating about those, you know,
the

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.740
articles. So and the other thing that I like
about books

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:48.250
is that they are -- and this is from a commercial
standpoint, too, is they're also advertisements

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:52.200
for
themselves. I would love for an iPad or Kindle

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.920
or whatever to
have a back screen where they show the title

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:59.910
or a picture of the book you're
reading -- the cover because that also tells

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:02.290
other people
this is what I'm reading. I used to ride the

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:06.450
subway all
the time as a kid trying to get women to notice

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:09.680
me by
reading Ulysses over and over and over.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.680
[laughter]

00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:12.800
&gt;&gt;Gary: Hey. You know?

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.950
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yeah, I was going to say
actually I bought your book

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:19.250
because I saw so many people on the subway
reading it

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:20.540
which is interesting.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:23.520
&gt;&gt;Gary: If there's a Kindle you don't know
it's out there.

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.570
Also, this is a great way to get to know somebody.
Let's

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:28.470
say you're out on a date and you're at somebody
cease

00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:32.290
house and the bookshelf is all Glenn Beck,
so you're like, "oh,

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:36.800
this is going to be an interesting relationship."
Sarah

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.350
Palin's new bio. Hmm. [laughter]

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:42.410
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Go see the Google digital library.

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:43.930
&gt;&gt; Gary: Yeah, I will. I'll take a look at
it. What I'm

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:46.381
saying is those bookshelves show a lot. I
guess there's

00:29:46.381 --> 00:29:49.650
a way to do it in the future where we can
walk in and there's a giant screen

00:29:49.650 --> 00:29:55.580
that says I'm a Beck lover. So that's my word.
[laughter]

00:29:55.580 --> 00:30:01.300
&gt;&gt; Female #1: And what about sites like good
reads. I find most of

00:30:01.300 --> 00:30:03.390
my new books that I read and new authors because
of

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:05.940
online connections. People post about it on
Facebook or

00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:09.390
there are social networks for it or just reading
blogs

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:10.390
about.

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:11.800
&gt;&gt; Gary: I think that's wonderful. I think
it's wonderful that

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:15.030
there's so many sites that unite readers.
What I'm

00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:18.200
worried about the is there's been a cost.
There's a trade off

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.760
here. The cost has been the death of a lot
of book

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.840
reviews. This country used to have -- right
now we have

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.210
basically the New York Times book section
and I think

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:31.150
that's it. I think the LA Times has been folded
into

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:34.830
entertainment whatever that is. Washington
Post also.

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:38.270
The Chicago papers are done for. You know,
this country

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:43.010
used to support dozens of book sections. Not
just that

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.240
but the New York Times Book Review -- love
it or hate

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:48.460
it -- used to be about 80 pages long. Now
it's about 25

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:52.040
pages long. I used to review books when I
became a

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:56.150
writer. It's not really done anymore. Nobody
gets paid

00:30:56.150 --> 00:31:00.770
for it. There's very few serious book reviewers.
There's Kakutani at the New York Times; James

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:06.610
Woods at The New Yorker. Talk about
the culture, the cult of the amateur and a

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:09.080
lot of the
amateurs are terrific. But there's really

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:13.280
been a huge fall
off in how people -- people used to buy their

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:16.920
newspaper and go
to the book section. Oh this is what so and

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.230
so, who is not just
somebody who reads three or four books a year

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:24.140
and is now writing, I like
science fiction I like this but somebody who

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.840
for a living
reads hundreds of books a year and has a good

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.220
opinion
about things or at least an informed opinion

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:31.550
one that you
can completely disagree with. So that's the

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:34.690
trade off that bothers me.
All these things like GoodReads existed, if

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.390
there was a healthy
good culture of criticism and review in this

00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:42.280
country, I'd
be the happiest doe in the forest. [laughter]

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.630
But sadly, the
Internet has eaten away at those things by

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:49.270
destroying --
by the fact there's no ad revenues from print

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:51.870
and hence
that part has fallen apart.

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:53.010
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Thanks.

00:31:53.010 --> 00:31:56.980
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Hey Gary thanks for coming. Enjoyed
your book. I

00:31:56.980 --> 00:31:57.980
only bought one copy.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.760
&gt;&gt; Gary: Oh, damn you.

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.350
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Can you talk a little bit about,
there was one passage in the

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:08.130
book that I thought was interesting, about
how our generation like maybe under 30 or

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:11.200
35
wants to be thought of as special as each

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.450
person. Just
sort of your thinking behind that. Is that

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:16.500
something you
see as a pervasive issue.

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.900
&gt;&gt; Gary: Well, it's fascinating. The immigrants
were brought

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:24.161
up to be very humble. At the same time you
had to be

00:32:24.161 --> 00:32:29.910
very ambitious, but you're also steeped in
humility. I

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:34.110
remember PTA in Hebrew school when I was a
kid. My

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:37.860
father came to see the teacher and she said,
"I hear that

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.400
Gary reads Tolstoy in the original Russian.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:47.800
My dad said, “no, just Chekhov. Ptui. He's
not smart”. [laughter] But now

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.230
it's the very opposite. It's parents saying,
“oh my kid. He's

00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:55.290
going to work for Google some day. He's brilliant”.
I

00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:59.410
think there's -- and I think this is the social
media

00:32:59.410 --> 00:33:02.980
where -- I mean, everyone is an author today
in a sense.

00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:06.040
We're all writing a book. People are reading
less and

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:08.780
less, but more and more people want to become
writers at

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:15.340
places like the Columbia we have so many applications.
And this is a terrible economy and it's fairly

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:17.700
costly to
go to a school like that. And people want

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.690
to become
writers quite desperately.

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:24.820
And the other visual artists as well, film.
You know,

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.120
everybody wants to express themselves. We
have this

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:30.170
incredible culture of self-expression. I think
that's fine,

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:34.610
but if everyone is special then who gets to
just read the

00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:37.640
special people? You know what I'm saying?
What if there

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.340
was more of a balance and there were maybe
some fewer

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:43.420
writers but some more readers. Wouldn't that
be

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:47.250
interesting for our society as well? And I
think maybe

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:49.520
it's part of the culture of things like video
games as

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.210
well. When you're playing a video game, you're
not

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:53.231
passively watching something . You're in the
middle of

00:33:53.231 --> 00:33:55.670
the action. You're the hero. And how do you
do that

00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:57.690
with a book? When you open the book, you're
not the

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:00.980
hero. There's somebody else. And that is a
little hard to adapt

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:03.710
to. And I'm finding that as someone who twitters
and

00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:06.870
Facebooks my brains outed, you know, I find
it difficult

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:10.220
sometimes to say, "just calm down and just
be passive and

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:13.370
read something or engage in media that you
didn't

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:14.370
create yourself.

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:17.409
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Do you think that's more of American
problem or --

00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:20.780
because there seems to be difference in the
way you treat

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:25.190
the Asia countries and their ascendancy versus
America in

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:26.190
the near future.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:28.409
&gt;&gt; Gary: Yeah, I don't think there's a great
culture of

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:32.720
specialness in many Asian cultures. Maybe
you would

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.060
disagree. There's a collective unit that's
very

00:34:35.060 --> 00:34:39.140
important that's not as important in America
which is the

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:41.900
most individualistic country that the world
has ever

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.020
known. And that individualism has worked wonders
for

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:45.970
us -- has allowed us to create some really
incredible

00:34:45.970 --> 00:34:50.450
products and some really incredible ideas.
On the other

00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:56.250
hand, the highway to the JFK airport could
be found in Burkina Faso, at this point.

00:34:56.250 --> 00:35:01.510
Flying from Newark Airport to Beijing Capital
Airport is a very depressing

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:04.340
experience. You know you see where the future
belongs

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:07.550
to. And that required the effort of a lot
of people to

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:11.880
put together the world's greatest terminal.
So I don't

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:14.450
know. You know, in terms of the economy I
also worry

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:18.420
about this. I worry are we going to be a nation
of Apple

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:22.480
and Google and some really cutting edge, creative
energy

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:26.000
that employs wonderful amount of people but
a small

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.730
amount of people. You know, what's going to
happen to

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:30.910
the majority of this country that doesn't
have this

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:35.130
really incredible education and it used to
be that in

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:38.660
America, you know, even if you were -- even
if you just

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:41.060
finished high school and you wanted to find
a job, you

00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:44.820
could get a job at a factory with health care
and with

00:35:44.820 --> 00:35:47.330
better opportunities for your children. And
the book the

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:50.250
world of Super Sad True Love Story, that's
gone. None of that

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:53.190
exists anymore. There's credit, retail and
media and those are the

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:55.810
only three industries that are left in the
country and they employ people

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:59.060
on the coasts who consider themselves to be
high net worth

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:05.251
individuals and the rest are just left as
sort of -- as a

00:36:05.251 --> 00:36:08.750
failed part of the country. I think we're
seeing that

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:11.330
happen already. And it's getting a little
sad for me.

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:13.120
Super sad. [laughter]

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:18.630
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Thanks again for coming. I want
to preface this by

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:22.340
saying I've only read an excerpt of the book
in New York.

00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:23.510
I haven't read the whole book yet.

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:25.760
&gt;&gt;Gary: It gets much worse. It goes downhill
from there.

00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.910
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Fair enough. I am looking forward

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:31.470
to reading it. My understanding of the book's
overall

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:35.470
genre might be a little clouded based on not
having read

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:40.910
all of it but you allude to 1984 as being
something of an

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:44.860
influence in the whole genre of dystopian
novels it goes

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:49.330
back quite a bit. They tend to be fairly earnest.
They

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:53.430
try to, you know, get across a fairly important
message.

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:56.880
And my understanding is that there's certainly
this

00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:00.660
dystopian elements but there's also quite
a bit of satire,

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:04.190
youth culture, or illiteracy that sort of
thing. In your

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:08.080
novel how do you see those two kind of genres
coming

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.671
together. Dystopian and satire. It's not something
you

00:37:11.671 --> 00:37:12.930
see very much of.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.480
&gt;&gt;Gary: For a reason.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:18.730
&gt;&gt; Male #4: I happen to -- I think George
Saunders for instance I

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:20.170
think does it quite well.

00:37:20.170 --> 00:37:21.170
&gt;&gt;Gary: Amazing.

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:24.150
&gt;&gt;Male #4: It's very powerful when done well.
I'm kind of

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.820
curious what made you combine the two.

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:30.240
&gt;&gt; Gary: Thank you that's a good question.
I think, you know,

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:33.510
trying to sell a publisher I'm going to write
a dystopian

00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:36.090
comic love story between two immigrants. They're
like

00:37:36.090 --> 00:37:42.670
okay [laughs] we'll put out a print run of
eight copies. [laughter] You

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:45.630
mention Saunders. I'm one of the few people
that works

00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:49.040
in his genre. I love his work. I'm always
paired with

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.890
him. I've done 100 readings with him in the
New York

00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:54.410
festival alone. We're considered the two people
crazy

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:57.020
enough to work in this very strange build
your own genre

00:37:57.020 --> 00:38:00.680
right there. I think of Jonathan Swift. I
think his

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:08.560
satire was really hilarious. There's a great
Russian

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.810
tradition of satire. Russia, as a perpetually
failed

00:38:11.810 --> 00:38:14.911
state, engendered some really funny humor.
Gogol, one

00:38:14.911 --> 00:38:19.970
of my premier Russian writers was my favorites.
The story that

00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:23.070
really got me started as a writer was called
“The Nose”. And it's about a

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:25.920
nose that jumps off the face of a official
in 19th

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:29.030
century St. Petersburg and takes on a life
of his own and

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:34.610
the nose puts on a uniform and a tri-cornered
hat and

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:37.130
starts walking around St. Petersburg and wooing
women and

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:40.630
going to church and stuff like that. And it's
about 15

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:43.960
pages, but it captures Russia more eloquently
than the

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.570
novels that are thousands of pages long. So
inspirations

00:38:47.570 --> 00:38:49.980
like that. And then, also the sort of Soviet
Jewish

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:53.740
humor that I have. I would call it humor from
the edge

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:57.400
of the grave, the humor of living in a country
that doesn't

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.220
provide very much opportunities for joy but
at the same

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:02.600
time trying to create your own joy by taking
the

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.450
dystopian elements around you and mercilessly
making fun

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:07.370
of them. This book was actual harder to write
than

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:09.340
Absurdistan and the Russian Débutante's Handbook
, because

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:12.130
those two previous novels were about the collapse
of the

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:15.531
Soviet Union in a way. In this, you know,
I was never a

00:39:15.531 --> 00:39:17.910
great patriot of any country, when I was writing
this I

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:22.480
was thinking, "wow, I always take America
for granted and

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:25.030
if bad things happen to it, it happens to
me as well.

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:28.560
It's different when it's not just some Absurdistan
on

00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.730
fire. It's different when it's your local
Duane Reade on

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:35.270
fire. And that made me very sad when I wrote
this.

00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:38.380
&gt;&gt; Male #4: Thank you.

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:42.470
&gt;&gt; Male #5: I really loved your book. It was
wonderful. I just

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:45.770
love your book. And I want -- you said I could
ask

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:48.390
anything. How old were you when you came here?

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:52.000
&gt;&gt; Gary: That's a really private question.
[laughter] 7 years old.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.110
&gt;&gt; Male #5: 7 years old.

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:54.110
&gt;&gt;Gary: School year 1979.

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:55.330
&gt;&gt; Male #5: So you don't really have an accent.

00:39:55.330 --> 00:40:00.560
&gt;&gt;Gary: No, I speak real good. I had an accent
growing up but

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.830
I would practice in front of the mirror. I
would say

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:07.590
attic and I would say addict. Because my parents
only

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:09.880
spoke Russian in the house. A lot of Russian
immigrants

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:12.080
do that sort of thing. Are we going to speak
English and

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.660
then our child will speak their mother tongue
or should

00:40:15.660 --> 00:40:18.450
we speak the original language in which case
we won't

00:40:18.450 --> 00:40:22.600
learn any English but our child will have
their mother

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:24.130
tongue. So I'm glad they kept Russian.

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:25.230
&gt;&gt; Male #5: So you're fluent in Russian.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:26.290
&gt;&gt; Gary: Pretty fluent.

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:28.829
&gt;&gt; Male #5: And where is that country house.

00:40:28.829 --> 00:40:32.190
&gt;&gt; Gary: It's around Hudson, New York. Feel
free to come up and

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:36.330
stalk away. [laughter] I'm so lonely I don't
know how to drive to

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:37.330
the grocery store.

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:44.890
&gt;&gt; Male #5: Just so nice to have you here.
What else? [laughter] I love --

00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:46.600
you know, there's so many things I'll never
forget about

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:50.210
that book like the Staten Island is the hip
new place. I

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:57.620
just love it. I love all the prices are geared
to the Yuan. Terrific, terrific hilarious.

00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:59.640
That's all I wanted, anyway.

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.120
&gt;&gt; Gary: That's very sweet. This is the kind
of question I

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.580
enjoy because it makes me look good.

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:08.730
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Where do you live?
[laughter]

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:14.191
&gt;&gt;Gary: 347 19th street, apartment 3G. Just
come on by. Just

00:41:14.191 --> 00:41:15.819
hanging out all day long.

00:41:15.819 --> 00:41:18.450
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: What are you working
on now.

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:24.860
&gt;&gt; Gary: Well, I'm writing a memoir, because
I'm 39 and

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:26.380
Russians live till 56 -- the men on average.

00:41:26.380 --> 00:41:29.320
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: So you only have one
more year to be on that 20 under

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.320
40 list.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.730
&gt;&gt; Gary: Yeah, I'm like the grandfather of
that list. So sad.

00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:39.930
&gt;&gt; Gary: Time flies. So a memoir which entailed
a lot of

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:41.260
interesting stuff. I had to go to Russia with
my

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:44.330
parents. I go back every year but they haven't
been back in about thirty

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:47.170
years. I drag them to see their old haunts.

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:49.270
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Did they want to go?

00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:54.810
&gt;&gt; Gary: Not really, but it was cute. They
were -- they

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:56.980
visited all the grave sites. That's what you
do. You

00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:02.470
visit all the ancestors. Oh, and I'm working
on an HBO

00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:05.850
kind of project. Like every other author I
want to do a

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:08.500
project I guess about Queens is what I'm looking
at.

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.010
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Is it a mini series.

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:15.090
&gt;&gt; Gary: Not like a fiction series because
what's happened is

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:18.320
so much of fiction has really moved to the
screen -- to

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:21.410
the small screen, not the big screen -- a
lot of

00:42:21.410 --> 00:42:23.810
writers -- well, you look at shows like the
Sopranos and

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:28.990
the Wire. The Wire is written by writers like
Richard Price,

00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:33.290
excellent novelist. And things like the Sopranos
and the

00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:37.000
Wire almost feel like a novel. They have this
incredible range

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.310
and scope and they last 58 hours which is
how long it

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:43.551
takes the average North American to read a
pamphlet. [laughter] So

00:42:43.551 --> 00:42:48.860
they're exciting. A lot of people walk home.
You work

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.900
hard. You have a white-collar job. You come
home. The last thing you

00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:54.100
want to do is read 400-page text. But things
like the

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:56.590
Wire and Soprano allow you to enjoy the narrative
energy

00:42:56.590 --> 00:43:01.360
narrative momentum on the screen without having
to read.

00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.500
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Yeah.

00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:07.390
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Hi. Just on that last point and
I think you've raised

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:10.710
a couple other times the difficulty of getting
people to

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:15.450
actually read literature. Do you think there's
possibility of some of the new Internet services

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:18.640
like
Twitter, FourSquare or Facebook, or whatever

00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:21.390
to actually be a vehicle
for literature?

00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:24.780
&gt;&gt; Gary: Well, you know, one's publicist says
you must be on

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:29.330
those things to even live anymore in order
to sell a book. I had to make a film

00:43:29.330 --> 00:43:31.901
to sell a book. In fact two films. I did another
one

00:43:31.901 --> 00:43:36.580
with Paul Giamatti. Very important. All these
different

00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:40.560
ways are – it's, you used to be able -- you
write a decent

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:42.620
book, you get good reviews and people would
buy hundreds

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.930
of thousands of copies. Now to sell those
hundreds of

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:47.780
thousands of copies you have to create -- you
have to be

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.490
on every social media imaginable. If I'm doing
a reading

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:57.030
in Camden, New Jersey -- before the intertube,
five people

00:43:57.030 --> 00:44:00.300
would show up. Now I post on Facebook and
Twitter 100

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:04.350
more people would show up. Which is nice.
You have to

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:07.230
do -- you have to promote the book face to
face

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:09.970
everywhere you can. Because a lot of the NPR
outlets no

00:44:09.970 --> 00:44:13.550
longer do -- have the authors. You'll still
can get on

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:16.040
the national ones but it used to be you'd
go to a place like

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.820
Denver and there'd be five NPRs waiting to
interview you.

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:24.060
So we have to be entirely creative to get
our work to the public. Some authors are like

00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:28.190
I'm fine with having 3,000
readers. And they're great readers and I don't

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:31.250
want
anymore. But being, you know, small, furry,

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:33.290
hungry
immigrant that's not going to do it for me.

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:38.190
I want the
Times best seller list. So I put in a lot

00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:41.120
of work. It
takes about a year or more. Year and a half

00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:43.490
to promote a
book. A year to promote in the states, another

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:48.890
half year to promote in Europe and Asia and
other countries. It kills you. And

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:51.280
that year and a half, I could have written
another book in

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:53.990
the meantime. So the dynamics for the writer
has

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:57.840
changed. Now will there be another resurgence
of literature all of a sudden that's somehow

00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:01.570
s
based on these platforms? Wow that would be

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:05.640
spectacular.
So far we've seen things in Japan. Japan is

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:10.480
the home of
the cell phone novel written as texts. Huge

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:14.200
best
sellers. I mean hundreds of thousands maybe

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:17.560
millions of
copies sold. High up on the best seller lists

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:21.150
in Japan.
It's basically people writing -- they're usually

00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:23.760
love
stories. It's usually a man and a woman texting

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.680
each
other back and forth and things fall apart

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.230
which is sort
of part of Super Sad True Love Story as well,

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:34.140
but fascinating
stuff. You know are they great works of literature?

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:37.020
Not
by my likes, but maybe I'm just too old to

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:40.830
appreciate it,
you know? But it doesn't read well is the

00:45:40.830 --> 00:45:41.830
problem.

00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:43.660
&gt;&gt; Male #6: Yeah, that's exactly the thing
I was wondering about.

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:47.120
The only example I've seen are Yelp reviews
by Cormac McCarthy

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:50.890
that are really well done.
[laughter]

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:52.350
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: It's actually on Yelp?

00:45:52.350 --> 00:45:55.542
&gt;&gt; Male #6: They're actually on Yelp for a
lot of places in San

00:45:55.542 --> 00:45:57.830
Francisco. And then he reposts them.

00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:01.480
&gt;&gt; Gary: Is it really Cormac McCarthy?
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: It's not like just someone

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:04.200
trolling his zone?
&gt;&gt;Male #6: It's in his style as well. They're

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.200
hilarious.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.200
&gt;&gt; Gary: Twitter is going to certify me. They're
going to give

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:11.670
me a badge so you know it's me. Very exciting.
I try to

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:13.590
put some effort into my Facebook posts. Usually
it's

00:46:13.590 --> 00:46:18.760
about my dachshund and my twitter posts and
stuff. And Twitter's actually helped me

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:22.380
with the screen play I'm writing. It's 140
characters.

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:26.120
And I'm used to being incredibly verbose.
Soaking in my

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:30.080
own, you know, brilliant verbosity. But Twitter
has made

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:34.640
me actually mind brevity -- think about brevity.
And so,

00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:36.710
I don't know. It's okay..

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:38.619
&gt;&gt; Male #6: Cool, thank you.

00:46:38.619 --> 00:46:39.759
&gt;&gt; Gary: Thank you.

00:46:39.759 --> 00:46:43.110
&gt;&gt; Female #2: Hi. I actually also moved to
the states as a kid and

00:46:43.110 --> 00:46:45.369
practiced my accent as well. So I can identify.

00:46:45.369 --> 00:46:46.369
&gt;&gt; Gary: Russia?

00:46:46.369 --> 00:46:48.820
&gt;&gt;Female #2: I'm from Spain but I also did.

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:49.960
&gt;&gt; Gary: Anya.

00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:54.030
&gt;&gt; Female #2: Si. My question is sort of about
the language and

00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:55.740
developing the language. I know you mentioned
the

00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:59.390
acronym like when JBF and sort of looking
at JK and

00:46:59.390 --> 00:47:05.160
going from there. It's such an exaggerated,
kind of an exaggerated evolution of language

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:09.280
that you sort of come up with or
maybe not exaggerated. But just wondering

00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:12.220
what your
process was for that. Obviously JK. What did

00:47:12.220 --> 00:47:13.980
you come
up to look at that specific.

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:17.780
&gt;&gt; Gary: I wanted to hear how younger people
speak. Teaching

00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:21.251
at Columbia is very helpful. You just go out
on the Quad. Everyone is JKing and

00:47:21.251 --> 00:47:25.540
whatnot. [laughter] And you know these are
-- these are Columbia University so these

00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:27.040
are
Ivy League students. I was at another Ivy

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.720
League
campuses where they were discussing my book

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:33.590
and the student
said, "you know? I really identify with Eunice

00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:36.720
and the
way she's speaks but I had a lot of trouble

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:40.680
understanding
Lenny because he's just thinking all the time."

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:41.680
It's
like why?

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:51.300
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So who does that? [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Gary: So, who does that? So I mean, I was

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:53.870
just at a
panel in key west and William Gibson was speaking

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:57.310
about,
you know, the science fiction writer -- speaking

00:47:57.310 --> 00:48:00.960
about
how he captures trends. It really is a process

00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:03.480
of
osmosis. You just walk around and you hear

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:08.270
how people
speak. One of the lines in this book was an

00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:11.940
old woman
comes out of an old apartment building in

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:13.490
New York and
it's really cold and she says, “oh my God

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:16.530
it's
blustery”. And that really happened. I was

00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:20.930
living in this
co-op with all these ancient people. I thought,

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:23.520
blustery. Who the
hell uses that word anymore? You know? It's

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:28.110
almost like
relegated to the extinct vocabulary, because

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:33.181
you know now
it's like, “JBF, it's freezing”. And part

00:48:33.181 --> 00:48:37.220
of freezing would
probably be like 4 easing. [laughter]On the

00:48:37.220 --> 00:48:41.300
one hand it's like oh
my God I want to protect words like blustery.

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:44.690
On the
other hand, you can't do it because language

00:48:44.690 --> 00:48:49.230
evolves. I
don't want to be the person crying big tears

00:48:49.230 --> 00:48:53.390
over the
demise of language. There's all kinds of different

00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:54.960
persons in countries trying to protect their
languages.

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.930
The French Academy always tries to keep English
out. I

00:48:57.930 --> 00:49:00.280
don't know if the Spanish Academy does the
same. But

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.140
there is one. It's constantly worried about
the purity

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:07.940
of the language, which is a very European
concept trying to protect the purity of th

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:11.140
language whereas
in America it's like “bring it on”. [laughter]

00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:15.350
I don't know. I think
it's very hard to keep things the way they

00:49:15.350 --> 00:49:18.240
were. And as
a writer who writes about today, I have to

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.110
be in tune
with what is happening.

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:23.340
&gt;&gt; Female #2: Just a follow up to that. How
do you then see this

00:49:23.340 --> 00:49:26.430
particular book? Besides your other books,
how do you

00:49:26.430 --> 00:49:29.910
see this aging or being read in ten years
not only

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:32.630
because whether the things come to pass or
not but in

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:34.980
terms of the language because it's so specific
to now or

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:35.980
ten years from now.

00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:38.320
&gt;&gt; Gary: I think about that. Does this book
have an expiration

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:41.170
date. I think all books have an expiration
date, but the

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:44.350
best of them, --and I'm not saying this is
the best of them – but the best do survive

00:49:44.350 --> 00:49:49.510
because the concepts are
universal. And I think this is a love story.

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:52.200
And love
changes the way, certain things about love

00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.270
changes. The
fact that we're texting and tweeting our potential

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:57.700
mates
has changed. But at the same time the actual

00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:02.250
biological
feeling is the same. The need for romance,

00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:05.890
which is also
a part of the biological neurological aspects.

00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:08.190
Reproductive urges. All of that remains pretty
much the

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:13.340
same. Fahrenheit 451 is a great example. The
book is

00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:16.490
about -- theoretically it's about a book burning
society,

00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:19.550
right? It's about a society that says books
are the

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:21.730
problem and they have to be burned. But when
you read it

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:26.530
closely, it's not really about that; it's
more about people don't want to read books.

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:28.770
The society doesn't have to enforce the book
burning.

00:50:28.770 --> 00:50:31.100
There's very few books left. Everyone has
four screens

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:35.060
that they have put on their walls and they're
communicating with those screens all the time.

00:50:35.060 --> 00:50:38.240
They
don't have any interior lives. Everything

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:41.410
is led in a
public way. So when Bradbury was writing this

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:44.790
40 years
ago, he's already talking about the present

00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:49.190
as we know it
now even though much of the book seems outdated

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:52.040
it
continues to live on in our minds.

00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:57.720
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Hey, so having read your work excerpted
in the New

00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:01.420
Yorker, you know, effectively becomes short
fiction, but

00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:06.100
it's obviously part of a longer novel. And
you know

00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:09.600
written as part of the longer novel. Have
you considered

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:11.670
writing something specifically short fiction?
Would you

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:15.320
see that has being kind of a way of addressing
the more

00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:18.520
limited time that people have to devote to
books.

00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:21.910
&gt;&gt; Gary: This is one of the strangest things
in publishing that

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:24.800
I really can't make heads or tails of. If
people's

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:27.840
attention spans are waning and it's getting
harder and

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:30.160
harder for people to concentrate, wouldn't
you think that

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:34.430
the short story collections and the short
story genre

00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:39.430
would profit from this? That there would be
a resurgence? The very opposite has happened.

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:41.680
The sales of short fiction with a few exceptions
--

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:46.270
&gt;&gt; Female Presenter: Kindle singles now like
a whole new genre of shorter.

00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:48.890
&gt;&gt; Gary: I don't know what the sales of that
are but the sales

00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:53.610
of printed collections -- and they're also
available on

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:58.041
kindle and E book have been plummeting completely.
Good

00:51:58.041 --> 00:52:01.590
example of that is Don DeLillo. I mean, Jesus
Christ, Don DeLillo has just published

00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:04.600
this amazing collection of short stories that
had not

00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:06.750
enjoyed the kind of sales you would except
from a

00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:10.230
Don DeLillo novel. I don't know what to make
sense of

00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:13.630
that. Why would people not want to read something
much

00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:17.350
shorter you know? And I think part of it is
also that

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:19.790
the New Yorker -- you've mentioned the New
Yorker -- they

00:52:19.790 --> 00:52:23.210
still do short fiction, but almost every major
outlet in America has

00:52:23.210 --> 00:52:27.680
stopped doing it. The Atlantic has now just
one fiction

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:30.460
issue. They crammed it all into one month.
I don't know

00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:32.480
how many people read that, but it used to
be -- Atlantic

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:37.800
fiction used to be a major part of the literary
landscape. So

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:41.810
weirdly enough short fiction hasn't benefited
from this. I don't know why.

00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:44.530
I think maybe people do still want a novel
because it's a

00:52:44.530 --> 00:52:48.210
fully immersive experience. You go into this
whole crazy

00:52:48.210 --> 00:52:53.170
world. So in a sense, it's kind of like entering
an interactive World of Warlocks game except

00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:55.330
you don't get to shoot anyone.

00:52:55.330 --> 00:53:00.220
&gt;&gt; Male #7: Sure. You can obviously do that
in short fiction effectively

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:04.720
as well. And I'm also just curious personally
aside from

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:07.640
commercial reasons, do you have a reason for
preferring

00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:08.640
writing novels.

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:11.420
&gt;&gt;Gary: I suck at short stories. I really
do. I can't shut

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:15.110
up. I've written maybe two or three in my
life that have

00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:17.700
been published. They're very long. They're
30, 40 pages

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:21.850
long. I just don't know when to stop. Actually
being a

00:53:21.850 --> 00:53:24.500
short story writer requires greater skills
I think than being a

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.390
novelist because you have to create the entire
world

00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:29.070
within the span of 20 pages. I don't have
those skills.

00:53:29.070 --> 00:53:32.290
George Saunders does. So if you want to go
read short

00:53:32.290 --> 00:53:35.080
satiric fiction that completely explains the
American

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:38.460
condition today go to him. And just buy my
book anyway

00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:39.620
and burn it or something.

00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:40.620
[laughter]

00:53:40.620 --> 00:53:41.930
&gt;&gt; Male #7: Thanks.

00:53:41.930 --> 00:53:48.300
&gt;&gt; Male #8: Can I turn it around a little
bit? Because it's sort

00:53:48.300 --> 00:53:51.460
of -- yep. You've been saying how it's the
audience's

00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:55.660
not reading but my feeling is also it's hard
to find

00:53:55.660 --> 00:54:00.119
books that are compelling and they're not
either written

00:54:00.119 --> 00:54:03.869
for the 3,000 audience where it's impossible
to plow

00:54:03.869 --> 00:54:07.450
through them or they're not written to be
sold in

00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:10.820
Wal-Mart. So you know your book was actually
an

00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:11.820
exception for me.

00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:16.270
&gt;&gt; Gary: Well, thank you. I'm trying to find
that middle ground

00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:21.470
between the 3,000 readers and the larger -- and
the

00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:25.100
Wal-Mart bin where those products just stack
up and are

00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:29.540
moved out etcetera . I wonder, you know, and
I think about

00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:32.060
this a lot because I teach at an MFA program
and there

00:54:32.060 --> 00:54:36.340
are about 400 MFA programs out there in America.
Well,

00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:41.090
English departments can't find students to
learn about

00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:44.230
English literature-- American literature.
Creative writing

00:54:44.230 --> 00:54:47.570
programs are overflowing. Everybody wants
to write. Do

00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:49.260
we create -- and this is the question I always
ask

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:53.570
myself -- do we create a specific kind of
writer, an MFA writer -- somebody who has

00:54:53.570 --> 00:54:58.940
a certain approach to literature where, you
know, and MFA

00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:04.230
programs all hone the same things characters,
craft etcetera, etcetera. Are we creating

00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:07.870
stories that are too similar? I
don't know. It's a good question. If you look

00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:10.140
at that
New Yorker 20 under 40 list almost every one

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:13.680
of us has an
MFA. It's very rare for contemporary writers

00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:17.380
. In the
old days your MFA was you went to Spanish

00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:20.400
civil war and
got your leg shot off and then you wrote about

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:24.200
it. [laughter] Now
you go to Iowa and hang around with 12 other

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.300
middle class
people and then you write about that. So it's

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:33.260
quite a
difference. Are we producing a class of people

00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:34.990
that are
writing the same thing? Well, looking at that

00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:37.870
list of 20
under 40, I would say no. And one of the interesting

00:55:37.870 --> 00:55:40.620
things how many of those people on those lists
do come

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:42.930
from foreign countries and are writing about
experiences

00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:49.240
that are not within the norm of typical American
background. You have Rivka Galchen who grew

00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:57.510
up in Israel among other
places. You have Téa Obreht from Yugoslavia,

00:55:57.510 --> 00:56:01.750
the former Yugoslavia.
I think ten out of 20 or something like that

00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:05.180
were born
abroad. That's what's so exceptional about

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:07.900
American
literature as opposed to other literatures

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:11.140
the way we do
welcome in people in from – speaking of

00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:13.720
short stories, one of the biggest best sellers
in literary fiction

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:17.110
was Jhumpa Lahiri's Interpreter of Maladies.
That sold over a million

00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:20.730
copies of short stories about Bengali immigrants
in

00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:24.520
Massachusetts. So it's interesting to see.
I think

00:56:24.520 --> 00:56:26.550
there is a lot of talent out there. The other
thing is

00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:29.050
we're publishing everything that moves. The
publishing

00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:33.220
industry is basically throwing darts at a
board hoping something will hit. For a

00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:36.680
reader you walk into a store you're surrounded
by

00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:38.780
gazillions of books. We're publishing something
like

00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:42.840
200,000 books. How do you choose? Except for
things

00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:46.970
like the New Yorker or the New York Times
or GoodReads or whatever it is.

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:50.510
It's almost -- there's an embarrassment of
riches. I

00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:53.640
almost wish there were fewer writers but they
wrote the

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:58.630
stuff you want. Which is not the Wal-Mart
bin and not

00:56:58.630 --> 00:57:00.359
the 3,000 either.

00:57:00.359 --> 00:57:04.310
&gt;&gt; Male #8: Right and I hope that you don't
think the answer is

00:57:04.310 --> 00:57:08.520
working for HBO, because frankly, it's so
limiting. How

00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:11.050
many of these things can be produced in a
year. And

00:57:11.050 --> 00:57:15.359
they're driven by, you know, the audience.

00:57:15.359 --> 00:57:19.580
&gt;&gt; Gary: Very few. I would say of all the
writers writing -- I

00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:21.680
think maybe 2 percent of us will actually
make it into

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:24.859
production. The scripts are commissioned,
but not

00:57:24.859 --> 00:57:29.080
necessarily be made. I think if it's good,
it's really

00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:32.260
good. I think the Wire explained life in the
American

00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:34.830
urban underclass better than any other book
-- it's not

00:57:34.830 --> 00:57:37.200
book -- better than any book I've encountered
maybe with

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:42.190
one exception. Random Family, Adriene Nicole
LeBlanc, a woman who graduated from Brown

00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:45.150
and spent ten
years living with this south Bronx family.

00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:49.200
Other than
that I can't think of any other art form that

00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:51.490
has allowed
me to connect with a world which I know nothing

00:57:51.490 --> 00:57:54.600
about.
So hats off to the Wire and things like that.

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:57.740
But you're
right for every Wire there's a bunch of shows

00:57:57.740 --> 00:57:59.369
that
obviously are sub par.

00:57:59.369 --> 00:58:01.520
&gt;&gt; Male #8: I look forward to your next book.

00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.520
&gt;&gt;Gary: Thank you.

00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:05.840
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I have one last question.
With all the -- you mention

00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:10.501
that the capacity for love has not changed.
But do you

00:58:10.501 --> 00:58:13.750
ever think that with all the technology just
these

00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:17.470
succinct forms of communication and incomplete
sentences

00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:22.580
and thoughts that that's kind of leading to
-- like, a

00:58:22.580 --> 00:58:24.810
lack or inability to commit to things?

00:58:24.810 --> 00:58:28.450
&gt;&gt; Sure. I mean, I think because we have so
many choices

00:58:28.450 --> 00:58:30.900
in every aspect of our lives at this point.
I mean, the

00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:34.780
iPhone is a device of choices. I want to walk
to ninth

00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:36.180
street. Well, there's four different ways
to get there

00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:39.320
and the computer is telling me you can do
it through

00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:43.520
route A, route B, route C, route D. The iPhone
doesn't

00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:45.990
have any sense of nostalgia. It doesn't remember
that

00:58:45.990 --> 00:58:51.190
the first time I kissed someone was along
route B and

00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:55.190
that makes a difference. In Super Sad, at
one point, Lenny is trying to

00:58:55.190 --> 00:58:58.290
read to Eunice as a way of creating a sense
of communication between them. He's trying

00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:01.090
to read Kundera's Unbearable Lightness of
Being. And

00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:02.950
she begins to cry because she just doesn't
understand

00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:05.670
what he's doing. She doesn't understand what
the value

00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:09.100
of this is. She's used to direct communications.
Being

00:59:09.100 --> 00:59:12.250
told what to do in a way, either by other
people who are

00:59:12.250 --> 00:59:15.190
on the Internet or by the giant corporations
that move

00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:18.770
the Internet along. She's unused to the idea
of having a

00:59:18.770 --> 00:59:22.030
kind of intellectual, non-pornographic encounter
with

00:59:22.030 --> 00:59:26.150
somebody. It's completely new to her. And
the result is

00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:28.630
very sad, I think, for both of them. In that
part of the

00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:33.490
book it becomes clear this relationship may
not work out.

00:59:33.490 --> 00:59:36.200
People say love will find a way. But let's
hope so.

00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:40.470
Let's hope there's actual personal encounters.
Physical

00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:43.840
encounters for God's sakes and that we don't
just retreat

00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:47.280
where it's safest. Because sitting at home
with the

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:52.160
computer is very safe. Sure people can send
-- I always

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:56.380
get angry tweets and Facebookings and e-mails,
you know,

00:59:56.380 --> 01:00:02.270
you're such a schmuck. This is a bad hair
day, etcetera. But

01:00:02.270 --> 01:00:05.100
it's safer than actually seeing people and
falling in

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:07.050
love with them the old fashioned way.

01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:10.240
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Okay. Well, thank you
for joining us Gary.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:11.160
&gt;&gt;Gary: Well, thank-you so much
[Applause]
