[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:08.530
IDO GREEN: One of the
driving principles

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.310
of the mobile marketplace is
that users want new-- new apps,

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.150
new updates, new content.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.530
In fact, over 60%
of the users who

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.330
go on to digital marketplaces
do so because they

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.840
want to try something new.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.280
While this is fantastic
for user acquisition,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.720
this presents a problem
for user retention.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.060
Because if you are not
keeping the user's attention,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.530
they will quickly be looking
for something that will.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.730
In this episode, we will learn
how to create a good retention

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.130
strategy.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.290
Ready?

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.280
Let's get started.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.240
The key to effective
user retention

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.660
can be broken down into
three things-- one,

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.950
understand user's
behavior in your app; two,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.840
identify roadblocks
to retention; three,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.860
use tactics and tools
to re-engage users.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.410
Now of course,
all of this starts

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.110
with understanding your users.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.220
If you don't understand what
they want, how they act,

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.650
or their opinions, you can't
really craft a strategy

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.420
on how to keep them happy.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.650
The good news is
that Google Analytics

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.960
has a set of tools to
give you insight here.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.350
First, check out your
Cohort Analysis report.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.170
Why?

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.310
Because Cohort Analysis
is a powerful report that

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.760
allows you to measure
and compare users

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.010
based on their specific customer
journey-- for example what

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.670
pages they visit, what
they do, how they behave

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.170
at each stage, et cetera.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.900
So you can measure the impact
of your marketing campaigns

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.330
on specific days, see
how effective they

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.560
are in generating loyal
users, and compare

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.440
which campaign performed best.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.210
Another good report
is Active Users.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.910
Find out how your users
interact with your app over time

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.700
so you can better
understand why they may

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.240
be staying in or leaving it.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.410
It displays your
one-day active users up

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.380
to 30-days active users
next to each other.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.540
This helps you answer some
important questions regarding

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.220
your user retention.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.920
For example, if your
30-day active number

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.740
is much higher than the
one-day active number,

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.030
most users are not
coming to your app

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.050
more than once during
a 30-day period.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.210
This can indicate that you need
to add fresh content on a more

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.520
regular basis.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.710
And maybe you need
to re-engage users

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.420
through marketing campaigns
and notifications.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.810
The third report
is about recency.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.970
This report shows how much time
passed between app sessions.

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.570
You might discover users who
only open your app once a week.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.120
Once you identify users
that engage with your app

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.550
infrequently, you
need to figure out

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.950
how to re-engage that audience.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.370
You could send push
notifications to those users

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.020
after three days to
remind them about the app.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.790
You could even tailor the
message to include incentives.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.970
A gaming app, for
example, might want

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.900
to send a push notification with
an offer of a free in-app tool

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.730
to users who haven't
opened the app in a while.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.080
Now that you have an
understanding of your users,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.070
you can start thinking about
what their experience is like

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.330
and get visibility
into what roadblocks

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.280
they are encountering
in your app.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.970
Here are three
basic ways that will

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.190
help you get this information.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.080
Screen tracking
will help you learn

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.170
where users spend their time.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.970
For example, if each level of
a game uses a different screen,

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.230
you could track what
percentage of people

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.400
pass through each level.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.320
If there's a level that has
a massive user drop-off,

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.230
that may indicate that there
is a technical issue associated

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.610
with that level.

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.670
Or it is just too hard.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.080
Monitor your
behavioral flow report.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.180
It takes your screen
tracking, event tracking,

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.780
and combines it in
a visual user flow.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.210
Lastly, use the Crash and
Exceptions report to identify

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.340
possible roadblocks.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.640
You could break data out by
app version, operating system,

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.830
and device brand so
you could evaluate

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.810
your app's technical performance
in different environments.

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.730
Want to take it
one step further?

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.050
Find out how much
crashes are costing you.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.980
You could do this by creating
two segments, one for sessions

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.250
with crashes and other without.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.770
Then compare the conversion
rates and the average order

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.100
value to see if these
metrics are lower

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.910
in the sessions with crashes.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:16.000
Now that you've got
all the basics down,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.970
the final step is building an
effective re-engagement button

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.579
for your users.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.250
This varies between apps.

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.220
But the tools we covered
today will help you

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.300
think in the right direction.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.500
Do me a favor.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.760
Stop spending money
on apps installs

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.910
if you don't have a
retention strategy.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.180
It's like the dude that
sells tomatoes at a loss

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:35.680
and tells his friend
that he's going

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.100
to compensate on it by volume.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.709
Game monetization today is more
challenging and sophisticated

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:42.500
than it used to be.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.930
A good monetization
strategy depends

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.730
on your retention strategy.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.540
You need to understand
your user's behavior,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.360
identify roadblocks, and
use tactics and tools

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.390
to re-engage with your users.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.120
On the next episode,
we will learn

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.750
how to use in-app purchase house
ads as part of our strategy

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.600
to increase revenue.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.614
Until next time,
eat your vegetables

00:05:03.614 --> 00:05:04.780
and listen to your partners.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.130
