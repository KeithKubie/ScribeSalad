1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:05,580
Bear was telling me that he did a
Carolines in New York City was like,

2
00:00:05,581 --> 00:00:08,070
it was almost like a college gig.
He's like,

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,320
people are so sensitive now in New York.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,040
Oh, you know, he and I just did a,
the VFW hall and Hollywood and, uh,

5
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:16,203
then,
uh,

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,650
the it and I was calling him
about another comic that I wanted.

7
00:00:20,651 --> 00:00:23,950
I was just talking to the bar. I
thought he was really funny. Uh,

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:29,140
and I now can't remember
his name. Uh, Joe Derosa

9
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:36,280
and I called him and he goes, yeah, I
know. He's really good. And uh, and,

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,790
and uh, he goes, how about I
come over and do it? And I'm
like, well, of course, Bill,

11
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:42,850
whatever you want to do, time
on it. Come on over. Well,

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,560
he was doing a bunch of Trump
stuff and, and uh, you know,

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,610
and I guarantee you my fans are
pretty split down the middle,

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,120
but it did not go over well and he
didn't give a fiddlers fuck about it.

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,760
And so he just made him mad and
stirred them up for about 20 minutes.

16
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,120
And then we both, uh, I did my set and
we smoked a cigar and uh, he, you know,

17
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:11,250
he's not drinking either for like a year.

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,740
Yeah. He looks great. He looks really
good. He looks thin and healthy.

19
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,790
Yeah. Yeah. That the Trump
jokes or interesting because uh,

20
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:23,660
I don't remember anybody getting
mad at you for Bush jokes.

21
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,730
Right. It's different. His jokes,
right? Yeah. Yeah. Even if you were a,

22
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,240
like a Bush supporter,

23
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,050
you could crack a joke about the
way he spells potato or something.

24
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,660
Like nobody gave a fuck. They didn't
care. It was a different thing.

25
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:38,960
Even if people were supporting and Bush,
by the way, that's spelled potato wrong.

26
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,520
Quail. Quail. That's right. That's right.
That's how these rumors get started,

27
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:47,720
man is I don't think it's data. You
conspiracy dude over here. It off.

28
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:52,220
This who spelled potato wrong shit.
Oh, that's right. It was him. Um,

29
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,480
Bush. Fuck some things up
too though. Didn't he? Well,

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,150
didn't fuck stuff up.
There's the whole album,

31
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:02,480
like the wit and wisdom of George W.
Bush. She says like, fool me once.

32
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:05,660
Shame on you. Shame on
me again. I don't know.

33
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,890
You know what's interesting about Bush
is when he was running for governor of

34
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:13,100
Texas, he had a completely
different way of communicating.

35
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,230
He talked like a really smart guy. He's
very articulate. I mean he was a smooth,

36
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:19,740
smooth talker,
like argument.

37
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:25,220
Wwe does a video of him from back in
the day when he was running for governor

38
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:29,360
and he's great. You'll listen to
him like glue, this energetic,

39
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:33,110
intelligent guys articulate.
He seems like one of us and then there's,

40
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,770
they had a side by side video comparing
him to like Bush after seven years in

41
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:40,160
office, like he's barely hanging
on because I pay attention to shit.

42
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:43,580
He's given the reins to heaven
and Hell to Dick Cheney.

43
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,840
Dick Cheney is in a bunker, seven miles
underground making the ferries decisions.

44
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,830
You know? I mean it was
weird. It was a weird time,

45
00:02:51,831 --> 00:02:54,410
but you can make fun of Bush all day long.
Nobody gave a fuck.

46
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,000
You make fun of Trump today.
People want to kill.

47
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:59,710
You got almost got into a scuffle
the other day at the gas station.

48
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,780
This guy just starts spouting out stuff.

49
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:06,700
He was putting gas in his car right
over there and, and, and just,

50
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:09,700
and by the first word that you is that
came out of his mouth from nowhere,

51
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:12,490
hadn't said a word to the guy,
didn't say hi to him. Nothing.

52
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,540
Nancy Polosi is the dumbest person
that ever lived on this planet. And,

53
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,580
and I get baited so easy.
I just said probably not.

54
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:27,220
Probably not that you're probably wrong,
it's probably not.

55
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,590
Oh, Obama was an idiot. He graduated
number one from Harvard law.

56
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:36,960
So yeah, views politically
aside, we can start with,

57
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:41,590
he's probably not stupid.
And what a good speaker.

58
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,730
He was the best. Oh yeah, it
was smooth. Most presidential,

59
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,043
he was a,

60
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:51,160
he was a guy that you were happy to have
represent you whether you believe with,

61
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,730
you know,

62
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:56,730
believe in him and support his ideas are
not as a representative of our culture

63
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:03,350
of our civilization. That guy was
smooth and measured and articulate and,

64
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,630
and off the book, you know it most of
the time, but you know, he was just,

65
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,710
he was saying what he thought and he
wasn't reading off a of scripted, well,

66
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:15,280
you know the story about
Clinton. I know, I know. Saw,

67
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,710
know with being off the book,

68
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:21,280
Clinton was such a good orator
that the teleprompter went off.

69
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:25,990
It broke like five minutes into his
fucking speech and he did all that shit by

70
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:29,020
memory.
You see the whole goddamn thing by memory.

71
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:34,330
And I played the nine holes of golf with
him. Was he like, and uh, it was, well,

72
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,570
there's still security secret
service all around him.

73
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:42,280
And so it was a private golf course.
Uh,

74
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:47,230
Larry Ellison a that
owns oracle. Oh Wow. Uh,

75
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,910
owns this private golf course.
It has 14, he's a big tennis guy,

76
00:04:50,911 --> 00:04:55,030
so he puts on the tennis stuff out in
palm springs and nobody plays his course

77
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:56,920
and he doesn't play golf.
And uh,

78
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:01,060
it's just his privacy as a deal
as own course. Got his, yeah,

79
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:02,050
he's got his own courses.

80
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,160
He played through our group and
shadow creek and Beverly Hill. I mean,

81
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:12,370
I'm in Vegas. It really exclusive
course, impossible to get on.

82
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,850
And he was playing by himself and
he was gone the tee box and I said,

83
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,920
as lonely at the top end.
And Larry, he goes, yeah.

84
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,550
And he was balling and went off by himself
and uh, but he wasn't even there but,

85
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:25,271
but Clinton was,

86
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:30,271
and he told me a story goes his friend
of his a record producer rap records,

87
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:30,940
big.
I,

88
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,520
you didn't tell me who it was and didn't
tell me who the artist was either,

89
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:37,630
but the artists was all thugged out and
he was in a Ferrari store and, and uh,

90
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,980
and uh,
the salesman,

91
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:43,030
he goes that you thinking about
buying this car and the guy goes, no,

92
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:45,820
I'm going to buy the car.
I'm thinking about pussy.

93
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,690
So the Clinton told me his story that
had the word pussy in it and Clinton

94
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,190
Clinton told me that that's a great

95
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,830
fucking story.
That is a great story.

96
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:06,470
That poor bastard.
He's almost like a comic.

97
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,150
Like you could just be free.
Yeah.

98
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:13,220
If think if he got divorced and just
started going on the honest Bill Clinton

99
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,590
fucked her. Yeah, I did. I didn't
want to either. Going to do,

100
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,990
what would you do? Would you do? You're in
my position. Would you do, you're smart.

101
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:24,321
You know,

102
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:28,880
you don't got the 40 years left to live
out a show of lap Prager ride in her

103
00:06:28,881 --> 00:06:33,380
mouth. That's what I love. The whole
idea of being the fucking number one guy.

104
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:36,650
You gotta be so Goddamn Pussy hungry
to want to be the number one guy,

105
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:41,860
100% you got to have big appetites
that for sure. For everything. Yeah.

106
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,430
For everything. For everything. Yeah.
That'd be super conqueror. Yeah.

107
00:06:45,431 --> 00:06:47,480
And all those guys aren't seeing,
I'm not all those guys.

108
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:49,280
I don't want to generalize,
but, but it's really,

109
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:54,281
really common for men that are in power
positions to just be horny as fuck all

110
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:57,290
the time. Of course. I
mean, we got to go back.

111
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,890
The way we want these people to behave
is so contrary to the way any king ever

112
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,790
behaved ever in history.

113
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,470
Like the stories of kings
throughout history was always
decadents. It was always,

114
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,813
you know,

115
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,390
all these women and why is food and more
food and feeding them vast open sores

116
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:21,890
and cutting off the fucking
ex wives heads and shit.

117
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:25,430
Like that's what you think of ordering
armies, people protecting them.

118
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,120
It's like those people were just gluttons
the super gluttons of the world and we

119
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:34,680
don't like that.

120
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,900
So then we tried to turn someone into some
fucking Norman Rockwell person. Right?

121
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:42,990
And that doesn't work either. It's not,
you don't have enough, uh, you don't, you,

122
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,510
you don't have enough charisma to lead.
Maybe, you know, Trump is showing us that,

123
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,800
like, you could talk shit about
him 24, seven, 365 days a year.

124
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,040
He's not adjusting anything.
In fact, he digs his heels in.

125
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,690
He the same fucking guy.
