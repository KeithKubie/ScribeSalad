 [Funny Music] 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.800
 Woman: When you launch a new app on Google Play 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.240
 Are likely to have been achieved from all aspects of the application, 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.640
 Such as quality test and make sure to fix errors. 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.120
 The application should also be realized 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.800
 Taking into account the policy we adopt. 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.080
 Here are ten ways to ensure compliance 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.080
 Google Play policy. 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.800
 Application Developer Policy Center ... 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.560
 Is your reference to all Google Play policy matters. 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.720
 We have organized policies by subject 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.280
 We put them into boxes. 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.400
 You can choose a policy to read more about 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.400
 See examples of common violations. 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.640
 You can take some time to describe your app 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.000
 To avoid violating the metadata policy. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.440
 You should read the short and full description 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.960
 Remove any redundant keyword lists, 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.200
 Or inappropriate information or inappropriate certificates from users. 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.120
 Application description should be appropriate for all ages 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.880
 And to comply with any translation to describe the application 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.880
 Metadata policy. 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.680
 If you want to comply fully 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.640
 With regard to intellectual property policy, 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.840
 It's a good idea to create your own photos and videos 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.360
 To promote your app. 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.680
 You should make sure you have the right to use 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.640
 App icon, icon, and any other assets 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.440
 Upload them to your store listing. 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.880
 If you have permission to use assets 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.640
 Third party, you can inform the application review team 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.920
 Via filling out this form. 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.880
 Like application description, 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.240
 All images and videos in your app should be appropriate 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.240
 With all ages. 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.720
 After completing the content evaluation questionnaire, 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.640
 You are almost ready to send the application. 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.200
 Accurate responses should also be provided 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.200
 In order to get an accurate assessment 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.200
 Applications that are not properly evaluated, 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.120
 Or not rated at all, may be deleted from the Play Store. 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.640
 Does your app collect user data? 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.840
 User data includes information provided by users, 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.360
 Or information about users, or those associated with their interactions 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.760
 With the application or device. 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.560
 If you are collecting user data, 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.800
 You must include a privacy policy 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.760
 In your store listing and in your app. 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.040
 Privacy policy should be set for users 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.560
 The data collected by your application and the purpose of its collection. 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.840
 Read the personal and sensitive data section 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.720
 Under the User Data Policy 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.000
 To see which data types to watch out for. 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.720
 When you submit the application for review, 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.240
 The Google Play team also reviews content 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.520
 Ads and their interactions within your app. 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.360
 Make sure your ad content is not pornographic or violent, 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.320
 Or any material that may violate our content policy. 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.760
 The ad must interact directly. 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.520
 We do not allow ads that are interceptive or deceptive, 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.240
 Including ads that appear to be notifications from the system, 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:02.840
 Or those that can not be removed, 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.880
 Or that appear after the user closes the application. 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.800
 A policy ad issue may result in an app disapproval 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.560
 Or suspension. 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.160
 Check your ad provider for filter options. 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.400
 See your app and your store listing page 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.440
 To make sure they are free from any restricted content, such as pornographic content 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.000
 Violence or drugs. 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.400
 If you're concerned about any content in your app, 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.520
 You can read the restricted content policy 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.440
 For more details and examples. 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.120
 Applications that include or display user-generated content, 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.600
 Additional measures should be taken to ensure 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.080
 The app experience is consistent with the policy. 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.800
 If this applies to your app, 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.200
 Review our User-Created Content Policy for more information. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.640
 You are almost ready to send the app, but only one thing left. 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.880
 Take a minute to update your email address 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.240
 And the Account Details page in the Developer Console. 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.200
 If a policy issue occurs, 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.120
 We can contact you to let you know what steps you need to resolve. 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.760

 It's time to press the bright blue publishing button. 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.400

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.040
 But your application may be rejected 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.840
 Or suspension after review. 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.880
 If the application refuses or refuses to update it, 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.640
 You can always handle violations. 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.000

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.200

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.680
 Then fix the problem and submit your application again. 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.800
 If you do not agree to a policy violation, 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.680
 Or if you want to help resolve your policy issue, 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.040
 You can contact the policy support team. 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.440
