00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.740
&gt;&gt; So are there any other ways that a mutation can be introduced?

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.590
&gt;&gt; Actually, yes. There's another serious but less

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.220
common exposure to X-rays. X-ray energy radiation actually causes

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.080
a nick in the DNA backbone, cutting it into

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.030
two pieces essentially separating a chromosome into two pieces.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.060
&gt;&gt; That sounds like really bad news, Matt.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.390
&gt;&gt; It can be. Most of the time your cells are

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.490
able to immediately attach the Chromosome back together. But because it's

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.280
such a big deal, your cells will try to attach it really quickly

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.689
and anything it can find. Remember, there's not a lot of space in your

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.770
cells and the DNA is packed really close together. This means that sometimes a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.930
chromosome piece breaks off and gets attached

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.970
to a whole other chromosome, like this.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.770
&gt;&gt; So the information is still

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.820
preserved, it's just rearranged onto different chromosomes.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.940
&gt;&gt; Exactly, and we call this a Translocation.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:50.500
&gt;&gt; But if all the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.790
information is still there, why is it a problem?

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.000
&gt;&gt; Well, sometimes all the information, it turns out,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.400
is not there, but even if it is think of

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.150
all the problems you could run into with rearranged information.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.709
Let's take this chromosome pair where there's one gene in

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:07.695
orange at the end and then another chromosome pair where

00:01:07.695 --> 00:01:09.930
there's this gene in pink at the end. Now let's

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.660
say there's a chromosome break in each chromosome and that

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.930
happens right in the middle of the two respective genes.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.935
And just by sheer random chance. Now let's say these chromosome pieces swap

00:01:21.935 --> 00:01:26.660
to the genes lands at exactly in frame with each other's coding region. What

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.120
do you think the most likely result

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.500
will be? Let's assume that everything swapped

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.120
in frame. I want you to select the answer that you think is best.
