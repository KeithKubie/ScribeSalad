00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.749
Well, here we are at Museum of Modern Art
and, believe it or not, it's the Club 57 Show.

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:13.720
I was one of the founding members of the club,
and it's a real honor to be here after being

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.200
in a church basement in the '70s for so many
years.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.900
If you really want to get an idea of what the scene was like,

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.560
you can stand in front of this wall of photographs and get the feeling

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.360
We were having fun, we were being transgressive

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.939
Here, all of these scenes converged.

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.670
We have John Waters.

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.710
We had School of Visual Arts, a lot of us
went to School of Visual Arts, a lot of us

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.380
met in San Francisco.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.239
So, we all converged, and we were the rejects
and we had to find a place to play.

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.480
We weren't fitting in the punk scene, we weren't
fitting in the gay scene, so we kind of had

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.140
to make our own scene.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.370
This is Club 57.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.500
This is the door of the Polish church right
here.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.789
Now it's a mental health center, which kind
of, like, makes sense to me because it was

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.160
quite a mental institution when we were there.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.540
Unfortunately, so many of these people are
not with us today, so it's bittersweet.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.820
Darling, how are you?

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.560
How are you?.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.500
Thanks so much for doing this.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.960
Oh, sure, thanks for asking.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.440
It's always the kids in the basement

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.340
The first time I ever went to the Club, we
had been rehearsing for New Wave Vaudeville

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.600
at Irving Plaza, and Susan Hannaford and Tom
Scully said, "Frank, do you wanna go down

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.000
and see this little club, this space that
we're thinking about putting the Monster Movie

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.159
Club in," and I said, "Sure."

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.320
So, we went down there, and I was like, "Where
am I?"

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.200
There was a gate, and you had to go...this
little lock, it was dusty, and there were

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.760
cobwebs everywhere.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.700
And Susan said, "Well, what do you think,
Frank," and I said, "Paint it black," and

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.880
we did.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.680
And that's...I think we opened, like, within
two weeks.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.540
We have many performances, this one is the
lady wrestling night.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.980
This was an off-shoot of the Ladies' Auxiliary.

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.430
They would meet every week, and they would
discuss issues and what they wanted to do.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.650
They would...I'm sorry, that's Wendy Wild
with her breasts.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:30.040
They would score on who they had slept with
that week, and they would get points.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.760
And, if they slept with a gay guy, they got
extra points.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.950
This was the Ladies' Auxiliary here, and they
started a group called Pulsallama, and they

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.300
did something, Min is the "Bonefinder" and,
"Find that bone, find that bone, find that

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.880
bone, find that bone."

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.230
And then, of course, there was Klaus Nomi.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.239
He dressed like this all the time.

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:57.370
He was at Fiorucci, but he was an opera singer
so he was legit.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.060
It was very odd that somebody could actually
sing, because talent was not required.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.680
That was what was good about it, you didn't
have to have any talent.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.360
You wanted to be a rock and roll star?

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.600
All right, go be it.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.069
We'll pretend like you are the star for $25.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.129
I did this piece, this was a piece called
"TVC15".

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.239
It was named after the David Bowie movie "Man
Who Fell to Earth".

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.400
There was the blackout in the '70s.

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:30.220
I was in front of Crazy Eddie's, and there
was a line of television sets, and right when

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.920
the blackout happened all of the TVs just
went off.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.540
Let's go down, and there's...it even gets
crazier down here.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.240
It's like we're descending into the bowels
of the Club.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.280
This was also over the bar in the later period,
the idea of America.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.180
This is John Sex's wall.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:03.299
You can see how he really took over some kind
of visual presence in the Lower East Side,

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.130
in the Village, in the East Village.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:12.730
It was hypersexual, it was hyper-celebrity,
it was shiny, it was Day-Glo, it was colorful,

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.330
it was transgressive.

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.320
By Kenny Scharf, this is "Cosmic Closet".

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:24.780
This is a new piece, but he's been developing
this sensibility ever since 1970.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.580
Kenny always kept it about fun, and he always
loved his black-light experience.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.130
Ann had to make up a calendar for every month.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.200
So, she started with a very basic format,
and filling in as it was booked.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.020
And, as you can see, they got progressively
and progressively more popular, and every

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.920
night was taken

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.100
We had Monster Nazi, The Flesh Eaters, and
The Frozen Dead.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.660
We had Playboy Bunny Night.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.120
We had "Bring Your Own Video".

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:02.180
So, these are very, very important, and she
did such a beautiful job with these.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.700
And, as I always said, we didn't live for
the future, we lived for tonight.

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.860
That's about as far as we went, "What are
we gonna do tonight?"

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.360
This is a painting I did for "Age of Insects".

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.460
It was a science-fiction movie that Eric Marciano
did.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.280
They looked through the eye at people.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.900
He paid me two grams of cocaine for this one,
right, and it's hanging in MoMA now.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.260
I want at least two more grams.

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.260
These are Kenny's paintings.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.910
I first saw Kenny's paintings...always, like,
some, you know, black and white, heavy-duty

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:41.690
kid, and he was making these paintings which
were...I went, "What are you doing?

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.690
What are these?"

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.680
You know, this was very LA.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.700
Kenny was from Beverly Hills, and he brought
that with him.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.260
He always had a different edge, a very California
vibe.

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.180
I love these paintings.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:01.280
Another aspect of the Club was theater started
happening there.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.680
There was performance, there was film being
shot there, and then theater people started

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.300
coming down.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:13.240
There was Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman,
who went on to write "Hairspray" and many

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.660
other great musicals.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:16.900
They started there.

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.080
My favorite one was "Trojan Women".

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.540
It was a musical, and it ran forever.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:31.080
It was so popular, it really started bringing
a lot of star power into the Club.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:37.560
They would line up, I saw it 100 times, and
I still scream and laugh when I watch it.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.920
Of course here we have Keith, and you know the iconic three eyes, and the running baby

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.640
When he came up with this, he had been at
Paradise Garage, dancing all night on acid,

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.240
and he came home and he drew it.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.340
And so, it totally captures that.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.550
I love this piece by Scott Covert.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:59.400
It's a human skull.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.220
I don't know where he got the human skull,
but he got it.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.680
We had, like, an obsession with death.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.060
We had a rock group called Youth Against Death.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.900
It was a fake rock group.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:17.120
We were too cool to play any instruments or
have any songs, but we actually got booked

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.900
in some clubs.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:23.470
Scott would decorate these skulls, and I think
they're very powerful.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:31.190
I think it was almost a precursor for what
is to come, this kind of lingering sense of

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.490
death.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.330
This video, Tom Rubnitz was an incredible
film maker.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:42.650
And Ann had been working on all of these characters,
like, this is Tammy Jan, and PTL Club was

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:43.650
happening.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:47.820
And so, she really riffed on TV.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:52.960
Here, we have Richard Hambleton.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:08:00.750
He recently died, but he...Shadows started
appearing all over New York, and Richard would

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:06.100
go out at night and he would paint shadows
in doorways.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.860
But they were very eerie, and he did them
'til the day he died.

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:14.620
Here we have Dan Asher, who was the craziest
person I've ever met in my life.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.960
He was something, he was crazy.

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:20.140
Good crazy, but he was something else, let
me tell you.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.520
And here's Archie, he would take jewels and
he would bejewel everything.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.980
And, at this time, you have to understand
that, like, minimalism and conceptual art

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.130
was what was happening.

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:37.159
And so, for somebody to decorate a minimal
circle was very radical.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:42.000
Here we have Bruno Schmidt and Peter Hristoff.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.580
We were all in art school together.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.770
But, as you can see, things became very sexual.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:53.720
It was the end of the sexual revolution, right
before AIDS hit, and I think male sexuality

00:08:53.720 --> 00:09:02.010
was really coming into the public eye, and
it was gay male, gay male transgressive images

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.920
that really came out of it.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:09.000
I mean, you know, being a queer was no fun
until, you know, yesterday.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:20.240
You should come and see the show, it's amazing,
and it really touches my heart because it

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.880
gives people that do not have the voice today
a place.

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:30.860
They were so important, they were so incredible,
and they created beautiful works.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:38.760
And, thanks to Ron, thanks to Sophie, and
Ann Magnuson, John Epperson, they put this

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:43.990
together, and I think you really get a feeling
for the Club in this space.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:50.900
Low ceilings, dark, it's nota white gallery,
and it is mixed media, it is everything was

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:51.900
possible.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.580
So, thank you for spending a little time with
me, and I hope you'll see it.
