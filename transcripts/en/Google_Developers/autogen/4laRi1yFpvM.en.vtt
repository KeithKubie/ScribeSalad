then the the other flow really leverages
 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.700
then the the other flow really leverages
hellosign and our functionality about

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710
hellosign and our functionality about
 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.630
hellosign and our functionality about
getting other people to sign so in this

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640
getting other people to sign so in this
 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.170

so in this case we just need someone

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450
so in this case we just need someone
 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:59.880
so in this case we just need someone
else to sign so we're going to choose

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890
else to sign so we're going to choose
 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.510
else to sign so we're going to choose
just others so in this case what we're

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520
just others so in this case what we're
 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.570
just others so in this case what we're
doing is we're processing the document

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580
doing is we're processing the document
 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.660
doing is we're processing the document
on our side converting it to a format

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670
on our side converting it to a format
 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.590
on our side converting it to a format
that we can display to other people and

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600
that we can display to other people and
 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.820
that we can display to other people and
once that's ready we should say continue

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830
once that's ready we should say continue
 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.840
once that's ready we should say continue
and this is going to pull up take you

type in who needs a sign this can be
multiple people in this case we'll just

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700
multiple people in this case we'll just
 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.760
multiple people in this case we'll just
do one person that needs a sign so i'll

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770
