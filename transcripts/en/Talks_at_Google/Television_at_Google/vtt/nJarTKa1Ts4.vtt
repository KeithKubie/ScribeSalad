[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.675 --> 00:00:07.925
DANNY STRONG: I'm Danny
Strong, the executive producer

00:00:07.925 --> 00:00:09.025
of "Proven Innocent."

00:00:09.025 --> 00:00:10.650
RACHELLE LEFEVRE:
I'm Rachelle Lefevre,

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.734
and I play Madeline Scott.

00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:13.025
KELSEY GRAMMER: Kelsey Grammer.

00:00:13.025 --> 00:00:13.819
I play Saul--

00:00:13.819 --> 00:00:14.360
Saul Bellows.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.152
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.047
I play that guy.

00:00:19.047 --> 00:00:20.880
RUSSELL HORNSBY: My
name is Russell Hornsby,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.315
and I play Ezekiel Boudreau.

00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:24.690
MALIKA SAADA SAAR:
So I just want

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.360
to start out with a
note of gratitude.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.830
I'm a human rights
lawyer, and I spent

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.610
over 15 years dealing with
the issue of criminal justice

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.570
reform.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.970
Many years with women behind
bars, girls behind bars.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.380
And I just want to
thank you for taking

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.710
the stories of so
many individuals I met

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.020
and creating this
beautiful show out

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.410
of it as a way of
centering voices

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.300
that aren't usually heard.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.029
So thank you for that.

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:59.070
Kelsey, of course, we're
going to start with you.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.145
KELSEY GRAMMER: Oh, lovely.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:04.860
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: So
I want to understand,

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.570
this show is about
wrongful conviction,

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.420
prosecutorial overreach, if not
misconduct, forced confessions,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.530
and really kind of surfaces
some of the brokenness

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.590
in our criminal justice system.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.940
What made you do this?

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.200
What drew you to be part
of this kind of narrative

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.730
and storytelling?

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.500
KELSEY GRAMMER:
Oh, well first off,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.590
which is pretty
simple in my life,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.030
somebody offered me a job.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.160
And that's half the battle.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.150
Then I went and saw the pilot,
which had been shot already.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.780
I replaced an actor that was
lovely in the performance.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.645
But it actually gave
me an opportunity

00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:52.770
to say, well, you know
what, there's a few things I

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.420
can offer you guys for this.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.070
I think he needed
to be more rounded

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.330
and actually try to put a
human face on a guy that

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.580
was to be painted as
a bit of a monster

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.950
and the devil of the piece.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.320
But he's a man of some--

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.750
oh, what's the word--

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.030
inefficiency, some
lacking, some insecurity

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.770
that lives in him that I
thought was kind of fun to play.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.580
And he's got some power,
but it's very limited.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.130
And he's got some courage,
but it's very limited, too.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.160
So I like the fact that he was
a bit emasculated in his life

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.390
and that this thing, his
devotion to justice, I think

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.560
is real and genuine.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.234
It's just also part of his 20
years in the business has been,

00:02:35.234 --> 00:02:36.900
well, this one gets
moved through, yeah,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.890
that one's guilty.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.080
You make some snap
judgments within the context

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.220
of this stuff.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.880
And unfortunately, it's a
concept or an ideal that

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.060
is administered by human
beings, and they're always

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.160
going to mess it up.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.040
Whether or not it's--

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.210
what's the word-- deliberate
or malevolent, who knows?

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.970
I think there may
be some moments--

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.720
every lawyer, I believe, has
rehearsed with a witness.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.210
I don't know if there's
a crime in that.

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.370
But I do think there is a
great amount of attention that

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.930
must be paid to this idea.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.940
And if you get it
wrong, you get it wrong.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.800
And obviously, people
have gotten it wrong.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.320
And maybe there's
an aspect of them

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.530
not caring or trying to CYA--

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.780
Cover Your Ass-- about it.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.410
But I found him an
interesting character.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.767
And what's nice is I
collaborated with Danny

00:03:35.767 --> 00:03:38.100
and said, you know what, I
don't know, I don't buy this.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.910
Or maybe he would--

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.680
obviously, the Chicago
Police Department

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.290
does have its sort of indictable
kind of character flaws.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.970
And some of them
even were announced

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.530
during the time we were
shooting the film, remember?

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.101
When they found
those three cops,

00:03:52.101 --> 00:03:54.100
I guess, that had set up
like 20 different guys.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.600
DANNY STRONG: Yeah.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.349
KELSEY GRAMMER: They
finally let them out.

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:57.650
That was a cool moment.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.610
But there are also good
people within the context

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.150
of this kind of work.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.900
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: So
how do you play him?

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.730
Do you play him as
not the villain?

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.810
Do you play him as someone
who has a good spirit,

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.100
but has been broken?

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.140
When you come into
that role, what

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.000
is it that you want to show the
audience about this individual?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.800
KELSEY GRAMMER: Well
I wanted to make sure

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.300
that people understood that he
actually cared about his job,

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.940
that he wanted to
do a good job at it.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:22.900
And thought he had.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:30.100
And was honestly quite convinced
that Madeline is guilty.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.026
And for whatever
reason that was.

00:04:32.026 --> 00:04:33.400
We left some of
it up in the air.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.275
There was a piece of
evidence that they never

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.430
found that left it possible.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.490
He might still think,
well, that will prove it.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.400
And we explored some of
this stuff in the storyline

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.880
as it goes along.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.780
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: So, Danny,
you shared this with me,

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.090
and I would love you to
share with the audience

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.080
the genesis of this series--

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.970
how it was brought
to you and what made

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.590
you decide to act on it.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.490
Because it's not the typical
law and order kind of series

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.615
that we've been exposed to.

00:05:01.615 --> 00:05:02.540
DANNY STRONG: Mm-hm.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.620
Well it started with an
idea from the creator

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.240
of the show, David Elliot.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.250
He's a screenwriter I've
known for many years,

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.480
and he came to me and said,
what about doing a show

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.019
on the Innocence Project?

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:16.810
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Can
you just tell people

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.360
what the Innocence Project is?

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.270
DANNY STRONG: The
Innocence Project,

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.590
it's a group of law firms--
although they're not

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.540
necessarily affiliated
with each other--

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.640
that are dedicated
to people that

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.740
have been wrongfully convicted.

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.120
That's their mission statement.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.770
That's what they do.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.100
And a really wonderful
organization.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.970
And I like to do
projects that have

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.030
some sort of social
justice component to it.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.640
I think it makes the
project worthwhile doing.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.040
And I simultaneously think
it makes the project better.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.920
It makes it more dramatic and
a better piece of entertainment

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.180
on top of it.

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.964
But it's just so
much more worthwhile

00:05:55.964 --> 00:05:57.880
when you feel like you're
working on something

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.830
that has something
to say as opposed

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.450
to just pure entertainment.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.250
And so a show, a weekly law
show on wrongful conviction

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:11.110
for me was a bullseye
of the kind of show

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.760
I'd like to be affiliated with.

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.610
And coincidentally,
the week before, I

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.150
had seen the Netflix
Amanda Knox documentary,

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.310
and it had enraged me.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.179
I didn't know that
much about her case.

00:06:24.179 --> 00:06:26.470
I just always thought, I
think she's probably innocent,

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.600
without knowing the
details of the case,

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.160
just what little I'd read.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.170
And she was so railroaded.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.820
And just watching the Italian
police detective discuss

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.600
her case, I had to pause
it because I started

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.830
screaming at the television.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.809
I could not believe his logic.

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:46.600
And then as the
documentary goes on and on,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.770
it just becomes more absurd.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.860
And so at that moment,
when he had pitched me,

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.710
I'd just seen this and was wound
up about wrongful conviction.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:57.440
So the timing was
absolutely perfect.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.310
And I said, well, let's make
the lead character someone who

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.870
was wrongfully
convicted and got out

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.070
and became a wrongful
conviction attorney.

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:08.601
So there definitely was
a timing element of this.

00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:10.600
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: And
it has become more a part

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.460
of the conversation, right?

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.410
You do have podcasts
around those who

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:15.820
have been wrongfully convicted.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:19.810
And you do have a lot more
attention to the Innocence

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.689
Project and those who have
been released because of DNA.

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:24.730
DANNY STRONG: I just want
to stay on top of that.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:29.350
I don't understand why it's
just now, in the last 18 months,

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.630
becoming a conversation.

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:33.950
Wrongful conviction.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:37.420
I mean, our justice system
isn't riddled with error.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.420
There are people in prison that
are guilty for sure, right?

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.650
It's a justice system.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.220
But there are people
that aren't, and it

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.070
is a grave injustice.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.100
And so the fact that
it's now just becoming

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.550
a topic of discussion,
I don't understand

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.120
why this hasn't always
been a topic of discussion.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.890
But I'm really proud
to be a part of it

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:02.710
now that it actually
is at the forefront.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.960
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Well I
think part of what plays out

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.740
is that we've had law and
order stories on television

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.580
that haven't given voice to what
you all are giving voice to.

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:17.380
And so that kind of movement
in the public square, discourse

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.650
around justice reform I
think has been very powerful.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.660
So I want to talk to the actors
around how they are doing this.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:27.490
Because I have to
say, as someone

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.860
who identified as
a movement lawyer,

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.500
I was really excited when I
saw Thurgood Marshall's picture

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.750
in your office and
the whole idea of what

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:44.530
it means to be a lawyer whose
righteous and part of a kind of

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:50.710
crusading way of using law as a
tool for justice and goodness.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.500
So I would love to know
how you both prepared

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:59.650
for those roles of being these
kinds of righteous lawyers.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:01.540
RACHELLE LEFEVRE: I'm not sure.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:03.670
Maybe that question is
specifically for you.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:07.780
I'm not sure Madeline
is a righteous lawyer.

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.930
I think she's doing a righteous
thing, but she's complicated.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:15.310
And her motivation--
she wasn't a person who

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.340
knew when she was young,
saw injustice in the world

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:22.587
and thought, I'm going to
do something about this.

00:09:22.587 --> 00:09:24.670
I'm going to go to law
school and dedicate my life

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.590
to righting these wrongs.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:33.530
She had a profoundly traumatic
life-changing experience.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:40.000
And I think that she's fortunate
that experience, rather than--

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.380
as you see with her brother--

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:45.820
rather than destroy her and
continue to break her down

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.680
and continue to
re-traumatize her,

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.140
that experience awakened
something in her

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.780
and that she wants
justice because

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.340
of what happened to her.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.920
I'm not sure that the word
righteous is right for her

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:57.445
as a whole.

00:09:57.445 --> 00:09:58.870
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Mm-hm.

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:02.050
It's about her lived experience
and doing the lawyering

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:04.480
from that place of
a lived experience.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.360
RACHELLE LEFEVRE: Absolutely,
because she definitely cares

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.880
about her clients and is
trying to save the people who

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.130
are wrongfully convicted.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:16.649
But from my experience
living with her--

00:10:16.649 --> 00:10:18.940
and I think we all have a
version of this in our lives,

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.510
where you try to right a
wrong for other people,

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:25.300
and you tell yourself
that it's pure,

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.520
and you tell yourself that
what you really want to do

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.610
is just spare other people the
hell that you went through--

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:34.780
but in my experience,
you're always in some way

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.410
trying to go back in
time and save yourself.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.890
And I think that plays a part.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:43.870
I think that's why,
in each episode,

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:48.424
she connects so deeply with
each of the characters.

00:10:48.424 --> 00:10:49.840
There are lawyers
that I've talked

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.960
to who have suggested that
she, in the real world,

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.790
would have to actually
rein that in order

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:57.190
to be a really good, effective
lawyer, that you can't

00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.310
be crying with your
clients all the time.

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.670
And that's OK that's what
our show is because we have

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.890
another lawyer in our
firm who is righteous

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:08.590
and who does hold
up that end of it.

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:10.690
And I'll let him speak now.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:12.190
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Russell.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:15.010
RUSSELL HORNSBY:
Well there's the why,

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.840
and then there's the how.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:21.080
So the why is because
when I read the script,

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.120
the story touched me, the
characters touched me,

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.424
the premise really touched me.

00:11:27.424 --> 00:11:28.840
And then when I
had an opportunity

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.950
to sit down with Danny and
David Elliot, the show creator,

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:35.950
and just have a conversation
about what we're trying to do

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.260
and what we ultimately
want to say,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:43.300
and they listened to
my thoughts and ideas

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:46.600
about who the
character is and where

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.350
this character was going to go.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:55.960
And so then we get into the how,
and you ask about preparation.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:01.570
Quite honestly, I look at
it as life prepared me.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:03.910
I feel like right
now I'm in a place,

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:08.410
in a space, where roles
are meeting me where I am.

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:11.440
And so the preparation
comes from, for me,

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.120
being black in America.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.220
It comes from, for me, knowing
that a Thurgood Marshall

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:19.600
exists, knowing that there was
a Frederick Douglass, knowing

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.029
that there were--

00:12:22.029 --> 00:12:23.320
Martin Luther King, Malcolm X--

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.611
righteous leaders-- there
was the Black Panther Party--

00:12:25.611 --> 00:12:28.900
who were out there fighting
for people, for their dignity,

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.530
for their place and their
space in this society.

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:37.160
And so as a man, as a
conscious member of society,

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.310
you ingest that,
you absorb that.

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.260
And that becomes part
of your narrative, that

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.790
becomes part of your story.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:45.040
And what I have to
deal with day to day

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.100
as a black man in America,
what friends have to deal with,

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.640
what you read in the newspaper,
what you see on television, all

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.010
of that, you don't have
to prepare for that

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.760
because that's a part of you.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:01.210
So the reason why this
narrative touched me so

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:06.070
is because I can then, in
turn, bring that passion,

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:10.260
bring that pain, bring that
anguish to bear, and bring it

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:15.340
and really now, as best
we can, as best I can,

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:20.950
touch people with my passion and
with this pain that I possess.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:24.670
And through Ezekiel
Boudreau, touch people,

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:29.500
pierce their heart pierce their
soul so that they can say,

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:34.630
wow, I feel something different,
I sense something different.

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:37.390
Now I want to converse,
I want to communicate

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.790
with other people about
what I just witnessed,

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:43.000
what just touched me, how,
why did that touch me.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.870
That's what moved me,
and that's why I'm here.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:50.700
And that's the preparation that
goes into this type of work,

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:52.810
you know what I mean?

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:54.660
The saying goes, you
can't lie in life

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:57.430
and tell the truth on stage.

00:13:57.430 --> 00:14:01.700
It is a part of who you are
that you're bringing to bear.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.120
And so there's very
rare times, but it

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:09.760
is where these roles,
they meld with the person.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.370
And you can bring--

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.587
I can bring Russell's
humanity to easy.

00:14:14.587 --> 00:14:15.920
And so therefore, it ain't hard.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.150
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: I have to
say that it was a lovely touch

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:23.350
to see that you had
saved her, right?

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.590
Because often when we
see these kinds of shows,

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:30.370
black men are the
predator, the abuser.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.980
And in this story,
there is a way

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:37.150
in which not only are
you the righteous lawyer,

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.370
but you saved her.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:42.220
And I think that was a
really beautiful touch.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.930
And I want to talk about that--

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.370
RUSSELL HORNSBY: Sorry.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:46.940
Image is everything.

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.233
Do you know what I mean?

00:14:48.233 --> 00:14:49.316
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Indeed.

00:14:49.316 --> 00:14:51.380
RUSSELL HORNSBY:
I appreciate that.

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.421
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: And I
want to talk about that.

00:14:53.421 --> 00:14:57.070
Shonda Rhimes talks about how
this isn't about diversity.

00:14:57.070 --> 00:15:01.000
This is just about when we
have inclusion in our shows,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.490
it's just showing reality.

00:15:03.490 --> 00:15:06.130
And I really appreciate
the kind of diversity

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:09.610
that exists on this show and
that is part of the cast.

00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:11.560
And I would love to
hear you all talk

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:16.810
about that experience of being
intentional around who you are

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:19.540
as character and
together as cast

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.640
in this very
different backgrounds

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.664
that you each bring
to your performances.

00:15:23.664 --> 00:15:25.330
RACHELLE LEFEVRE: I
would like to invite

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:28.960
Danny to talk about the process
that was so inclusive when you

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:31.090
were building the writers room.

00:15:31.090 --> 00:15:31.840
DANNY STRONG: Oh.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.770
I mean, our writer's room
is 50% African-American,

00:15:35.770 --> 00:15:38.247
and that's what I wanted--

00:15:38.247 --> 00:15:39.580
RACHELLE LEFEVRE: And 50% women.

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.490
DANNY STRONG: And 50% women.

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.590
That's what I wanted
the room to be.

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:47.170
I thought that is
what it needed to be,

00:15:47.170 --> 00:15:51.640
I mean, especially on a show
about wrongful conviction,

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.000
in which people of color
are so adversely affected

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.235
by wrongful conviction.

00:15:56.235 --> 00:15:57.610
And so many people
that have been

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.200
wrongfully convicted and been
released are people of color.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.900
So how do you do
a show like this

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.740
and not have your writers'
room, your writers,

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:08.050
a ton of people of
color in the room.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:12.880
And then also with the casting
for the leads of the show,

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.250
for our law firm, we
have two white lawyers,

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:16.480
two African-American lawyers.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.445
I thought, OK, well
that's a cool makeup

00:16:18.445 --> 00:16:19.930
for a wrongful
conviction law firm.

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.170
And our directors, the same.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.380
We've had many people
of color directing,

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:30.557
many women directing, many
women of color directing.

00:16:30.557 --> 00:16:32.140
MALIKA SAADA SAAR:
You mentioned that.

00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:33.760
DANNY STRONG: Yeah, of course.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.540
It's been a great mix.

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:38.170
But I want to do that
on everything I work on,

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:41.052
not just because the show is
about wrongful conviction.

00:16:41.052 --> 00:16:42.010
RACHELLE LEFEVRE: Yeah.

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:43.780
And I think the
reason I really wanted

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.790
to have Danny say that
is also because I think

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.440
that the way that
you talk about it

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:51.680
represents where we
really should be,

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.850
which is the idea that
that's taken for granted.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.040
The idea that it doesn't
have to be effortful,

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.373
that it doesn't have to be
something where you're trying

00:16:59.373 --> 00:17:02.760
to show how aware you are.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.470
It's just the right thing
to do to be inclusive.

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:09.020
It's just the best case
scenario for everybody involved.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:12.400
And so I think that
in a way, as much

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:15.880
as these are conversations
that are weighted,

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:19.540
there is a certain amount
where you can kind of breathe

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:24.079
when you encounter people
who are where we want to go,

00:17:24.079 --> 00:17:27.040
which is just to take these
things for granted as just

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.310
the way to be.

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:30.640
And so I always really
appreciate the way

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.837
that you talk about that,
that it was obvious.

00:17:33.837 --> 00:17:35.670
KELSEY GRAMMER: Yeah,
you know what's funny?

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:37.300
I'm thinking back
through some of the shows

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:38.091
that I've produced.

00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:45.850
On "Frasier," it was probably
70% white, 30% black writers

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:47.950
on the staff.

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:51.120
There's an old saying, though,
you write what you know.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.310
But on "Girlfriends," I think we
had one white girl for a while.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:55.284
It was mostly black.

00:17:55.284 --> 00:17:57.450
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Can I
just take a moment, though?

00:17:57.450 --> 00:17:59.980
Because a lot of my
friends talk about this.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.570
When I shared with them
that I was interviewing you,

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:06.720
they were like, he produced
"Girlfriends" and "The Game."

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.310
Kelsey Grammer did that.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:11.550
And I just want to acknowledge
that, give a shout-out

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:14.390
to the fact that you were
supporting black content

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.410
for more than just
the moment that this

00:18:16.410 --> 00:18:17.830
has been part of your presence
and work in Hollywood.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:19.250
KELSEY GRAMMER: A
long time, yeah.

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:20.749
And the presumption
has always been,

00:18:20.749 --> 00:18:23.790
well, you just hire who's good.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:26.490
I mean, I've never really
put a lot of labels

00:18:26.490 --> 00:18:29.280
on whether or not it
should be this or that.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.140
It made sense on
"Girlfriends" to have

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.660
a bunch of girls
who were-- well,

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:38.370
half the girls were mixed, and
that was kind of interesting,

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:38.940
too.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.850
And we had one writer that
was a mixed race there,

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:44.850
and that brought a
certain perspective.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:47.410
But of course, when you're
collaborating on the floor,

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:50.670
especially in a sitcom,
the actors and the writers,

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.200
if they don't have
a communication

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.850
and a collaborative spirit
instantly about what they know,

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:57.100
what they can say to a writer.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.255
No, no, no, you guys
have got this one wrong.

00:19:00.255 --> 00:19:03.270
That's what you have to be able
to do, in that circumstance

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:04.870
specifically.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.430
In a hour-long
scripted drama, there's

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.920
a little more distance
between the actor

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:13.230
and the writing staff as a rule.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:18.980
But "Girlfriends" started 20
years ago, something like that.

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:25.220
I mean, it seemed as natural as
apple pie to just do that show.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.040
I don't know.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.230
I mean, we've always
had a diversity.

00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:31.010
NBC always had a
diversity kind of event,

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:33.460
where they'd invite a few
people of Asian descent

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.120
and a couple of black people
and a couple of white people

00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.786
to stand up on the stage and go,
yeah, it's more important to us

00:19:38.786 --> 00:19:39.810
to have diversity.

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:43.440
And I thought, well, shit, put
your money where your mouth is.

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:47.332
So I went and pitched the
show, and somebody finally

00:19:47.332 --> 00:19:49.290
said, yeah, we ought to
put that on television.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.590
So it seemed like
a natural thing

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:54.540
to do, a natural expression of--

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:57.820
I grew up in the generation--

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.370
my grandparents
raised me mostly,

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.914
and they were colorblind people.

00:20:01.914 --> 00:20:03.330
They said, you
don't judge anybody

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:04.621
based upon what they look like.

00:20:04.621 --> 00:20:07.982
You judge them based upon
what they do, who they are.

00:20:07.982 --> 00:20:08.940
And you take your time.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.280
You don't judge anybody
until you get to know them.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:12.907
Once you get to
know them, then you

00:20:12.907 --> 00:20:14.490
have some information
by which to say,

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:18.000
no, this one's an
asshole, that one's OK.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.340
And it's pretty elemental.

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:23.640
Now I think people should be
hired based upon whether or not

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.960
they're good at their job.

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:31.410
I do think it's great to have
as much diversity and as much

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:33.930
sort of openness about
wherever you come from.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:36.690
As long as you show up that
day ready to work, bang,

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:38.340
you're my guy or girl.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.450
It doesn't matter to me.

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:45.546
So, I mean, maybe that's a funny
lens, but I'm a practical guy.

00:20:45.546 --> 00:20:47.670
It's like, I want to go to
work, I want to go home.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.760
Soon as we're on the
set, we're going like,

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.940
what the hell is taking so long?

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:56.310
What the hell's going on now?

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.680
It's pretty simple stuff.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.780
I mean, we got a French
guy that's a cameraman.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.000
I mean, I don't know,
maybe that's something

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.044
we should find more important.

00:21:05.044 --> 00:21:07.210
RUSSELL HORNSBY: He's waiting
for the wine at lunch.

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:08.150
KELSEY GRAMMER: Yeah, he's all,
(FRENCH ACCENT) Wait a minute,

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:10.668
we work the wrong
hours, this is terrible.

00:21:10.668 --> 00:21:13.702
(NORMAL VOICE) But I
love the process we live.

00:21:13.702 --> 00:21:15.660
And I love the fact that
we care enough to say,

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.675
you know what, here's an
issue we'd like to examine.

00:21:21.001 --> 00:21:22.500
The simplest answer
to your question

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.166
about why I took this
role is somebody's

00:21:24.166 --> 00:21:25.650
got to play the
bad guy, honestly.

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:27.030
Somebody has to play that.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:30.630
But I believe he's a
good human being who

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:32.490
has made a lot of
serious mistakes,

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:35.390
and continues to make
them, as you will see.

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:41.910
But I'm suddenly
talking too much.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:45.300
I find myself suddenly in
a compromising position

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.840
because the Fox
advertising people

00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:53.910
asked me to do a fake
campaign speech for Rosemary's

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:55.870
Law or that sort of thing.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:22:00.210
I actually do a speech for
that on a campaign issue

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:04.590
called Marcy's Law, which is
for victims' rights, which

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:06.480
is a weird thing.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.390
My sister was murdered
when she was 18,

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.580
and there were three
guys that killed her.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.590
But they also killed
seven other people.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:17.790
And my dad was also murdered,
which is a different story.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.670
But the guy that killed
my dad actually got out,

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.650
and nobody told us about it.

00:22:22.650 --> 00:22:24.447
And we found out by accident.

00:22:24.447 --> 00:22:26.280
I actually found out--
the National Enquirer

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.140
wrote an article about it and
said, why is this guy out,

00:22:29.140 --> 00:22:30.630
and why is his last name Niles?

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:31.880
Did they do that deliberately?

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:33.970
Did they call his brother
Niles for a reason?

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:35.959
I mean, that was just
so weird and awful.

00:22:35.959 --> 00:22:38.250
And so I thought it would be
important to start talking

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:39.291
about that kind of stuff.

00:22:39.291 --> 00:22:44.220
So in the face of what we're
doing in terms of a cause

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:49.440
célebre, it's odd that I'm
involved in this other world

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.440
where--

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.630
I'm pro death penalty in
spirit because of the guys

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:58.650
that killed my sister,
but I am against it

00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:02.760
because you would never want
to kill an innocent man.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.090
And if you don't know
for sure, you know.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:08.320
I mean, if it was up
to me, I'd kill them.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.400
That'd be fine.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.810
Let me take care of these two.

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:12.310
There's only two of them left.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:15.450
But there was four
other families.

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:17.950
The prosecutor decided
that they would only

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:20.860
try for three of the murders
because those were slam dunks,

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:21.970
they thought.

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:26.431
And they left four other
families without closure kind

00:23:26.431 --> 00:23:26.930
of.

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:29.791
And I thought, boy, this is
a sad thing for our justice

00:23:29.791 --> 00:23:30.290
system.

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:33.110
I mean, she died in '75,
so it was a while ago.

00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:38.337
But I'm flying out on March
15 to ask them to keep

00:23:38.337 --> 00:23:39.420
one of these guys in jail.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:46.082
Every year, he gets a chance
to say, I did my time,

00:23:46.082 --> 00:23:46.790
I should get out.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:48.510
Well, he killed seven people.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:50.093
MALIKA SAADA SAAR:
I want to thank you

00:23:50.093 --> 00:23:52.200
for sharing your sister's
story and for having

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:55.710
the courage to give voice to
what it means to have a loved

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:58.860
one murdered in that
way and be able to talk

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:01.740
about the work of the
wrongfully convicted,

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.064
to be able to hold
both realities--

00:24:04.064 --> 00:24:05.980
KELSEY GRAMMER: You do
want to hold them both.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:06.275
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Absolutely.

00:24:06.275 --> 00:24:06.960
KELSEY GRAMMER:
Because we don't want

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:08.950
to be a society that makes
those kind of mistakes.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:09.990
We just don't want to be.

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:11.239
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Absolutely.

00:24:11.239 --> 00:24:13.410
And we are a better
system for being

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:16.140
able to hold both those places.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.910
And the conversation
around justice

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:21.550
is a better one because we
can hold both of those places.

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:22.870
So thank you.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:27.870
I come out of the
work of girls who

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:31.440
have been bought
and sold and seen

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.850
seeing horrible ways that they
were raped and commercialized.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:42.420
And fighting for those
abusers to be held accountable

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:45.660
goes side by side
with the insistence

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.131
on fair and equitable justice.

00:24:47.131 --> 00:24:48.255
KELSEY GRAMMER: Absolutely.

00:24:48.255 --> 00:24:51.152
You can't rush to judgement,
but you got to get them.

00:24:51.152 --> 00:24:52.110
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Yes.

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:52.680
Yes.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.107
So thank you for bringing
all of that present with us.

00:24:55.107 --> 00:24:56.190
KELSEY GRAMMER: Thank you.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:58.106
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: I
wanted to ask each of you

00:24:58.106 --> 00:25:01.020
to just talk about how this
series and everything that it

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:05.310
brings forward and all the
ways that it has asked of you

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:10.900
to stretch yourselves
as writers, as actors,

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:16.140
as producers and all of what it
has forced you to bear witness

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:20.550
to in terms of the stories of
the wrongfully convicted, which

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:23.130
are such horrible
egregious stories in terms

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:27.330
of their suffering, but evidence
of a broken justice system,

00:25:27.330 --> 00:25:30.450
if you could talk
about how all of that

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:34.569
has changed you as a result
of your work in the series.

00:25:34.569 --> 00:25:36.860
RUSSELL HORNSBY: It's a
challenging question to answer.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.910
But all I can do is just
hearken back to kind

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:44.130
of what I said before, that it's
been ever present in my life.

00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:49.080
The notion of the wrongfully
convicted, that it's

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.070
been a part of me and my life.

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:55.810
And so I don't think it hasn't
really changed me, per se.

00:25:55.810 --> 00:26:03.480
It's just made living life a lot
more painful because now it's

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.250
ever present.

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:08.120
You're always aware of it,
but now it's ever present.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.290
It's in the forefront
of your spirit.

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.620
So you listen to podcasts,
you read about things.

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:22.855
And now that I have
children, I cry for them,

00:26:22.855 --> 00:26:24.150
do you know what I mean?

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:26.915
It pains me when I think
about these stories

00:26:26.915 --> 00:26:28.770
or when I listen
to them or I meet

00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:35.160
people who have been exonerated,
it's painful, quite honestly.

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:40.380
And so that's what continues
to give me the passion

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:45.005
just to move forward and to work
as hard as we do on the work,

00:26:45.005 --> 00:26:45.630
quite honestly.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:52.170
Because when people see it,
whatever they take from it,

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:54.510
you want to make
sure that it's full

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:57.990
and that it's fully something
that they can ingest and then

00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.699
ultimately feel.

00:26:58.699 --> 00:27:00.240
KELSEY GRAMMER: I'm
just glad to lend

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:01.614
a voice to anything
that actually

00:27:01.614 --> 00:27:03.210
seems important at the time.

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:07.800
I honestly am a
witness, I suppose.

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.330
And I think probably
more important

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:12.300
than anything else is to witness
something that is happening,

00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:17.310
to bring light to it
and be a part of that.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.105
I mean, somebody told
me a long time ago--

00:27:19.105 --> 00:27:20.730
this is not an
original thought--

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:24.200
great art makes
us ask questions.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.820
If you walk away with a
question or two and say,

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:30.370
maybe I better check that out
or rethink this a little bit,

00:27:30.370 --> 00:27:32.780
that's about as good as
an actor's life can get.

00:27:32.780 --> 00:27:34.290
That you've actually
done something

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:39.360
that maybe someone decided one
day to take a pause and rethink

00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.020
something.

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:45.410
So I feel quite happy
to be part of the game.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:46.910
RACHELLE LEFEVRE:
I would echo that,

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:51.960
and I would say that the
experience that I had making it

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:52.820
was that.

00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:54.611
And then I feel that
the way that I changed

00:27:54.611 --> 00:27:56.470
was the way that I grew.

00:27:56.470 --> 00:28:01.630
We had episodes
every week that dealt

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:04.870
with corruption for
a myriad of reasons

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:07.900
and all kinds of biases.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:13.390
We deal with racial bias,
sexual bias, gender bias,

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:16.120
sexual orientation,
religious bias.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.700
I mean, we get these
scripts, and at

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:25.090
the heart of every script is
a massive subject to unpack.

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.630
And we are trying to make
a television show, not

00:28:28.630 --> 00:28:31.570
a philosophical
documentary, where we all

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:34.150
sit around and talk about
our feelings and experiences

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:35.330
and try to figure it out.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:37.038
But that's what we
did behind the scenes.

00:28:37.038 --> 00:28:39.700
Because you don't get a
script like that if you have

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:43.030
a cast like we have,
that is incredibly

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:45.940
engaged and thoughtful
and wants to participate

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.190
in the conversation, you
don't get those scripts

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:51.460
and then not immediately
start to brrrrup.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.587
And it was a really
amazing thing for me.

00:28:54.587 --> 00:28:56.170
I keep repeating
this phrase because I

00:28:56.170 --> 00:28:57.610
think it's so important.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:28:59.440
My sister calls it--

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.300
when we start difficult
conversations in our family,

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:05.422
my sister stops when we're
about to enter into challenging

00:29:05.422 --> 00:29:07.630
territory of any kind and
she goes, wait, wait, wait,

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:11.260
and she announces
assumption of goodwill.

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.690
And it's such a
beautiful thing, and I've

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:16.510
started to do it
in my regular life,

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:18.920
in conversations with people
that I'm comfortable with

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.336
and people I'm
uncomfortable with.

00:29:20.336 --> 00:29:22.240
I go, hold on, if
we're going to do

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.896
this, let's give each other--

00:29:24.896 --> 00:29:26.270
there's a group
or individually--

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:27.880
let's have assumption
of goodwill.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:31.630
Because these conversations
don't result in progress

00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:34.180
unless people are
allowed to, A, be

00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:36.520
honest in ways that
might incriminate them

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.460
in the conversation
or, B, they are

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:44.560
allowed to admit ignorance,
either by admission

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:48.400
or by demonstrating ignorance
in what they're saying.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:51.130
And those things need grace.

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:53.980
They need the other
person not to attack,

00:29:53.980 --> 00:29:56.800
not to launch into diatribe.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.050
They need the other
person to just stop

00:29:59.050 --> 00:30:01.052
and inform and educate
and offer an opportunity.

00:30:01.052 --> 00:30:03.010
Now if the person doesn't
take the opportunity,

00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:04.900
that's a different conversation.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.450
But if the person is going
to take the opportunity,

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:09.800
the only way to know that
is to give it to them.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.590
And that's what happened
with, as Danny pointed out,

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:15.040
we have a diverse cast,
and it was an opportunity

00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.580
behind the scenes each time
for me to go to my castmates

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:24.580
and say, I understand this
only on the surface, please

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:26.050
can you explain this to me?

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:27.460
Can you broaden this for me?

00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.320
Can you deepen this for me?

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:32.890
Or to do the opposite,
to say, actually,

00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.510
I understand that you
have your back up a bit,

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:36.940
but let me give
you my perspective

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.950
and let me give you
an alternative way--

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:41.000
let me reframe that for you.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.780
And that's how we
functioned every day on set,

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:47.251
and it was the most,
for that single reason--

00:30:47.251 --> 00:30:49.000
in addition to everybody
just being lovely

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.880
and us having a great time
making a good television show--

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:55.990
for that reason was the single
most gratifying work experience

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:57.640
I've ever had.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.210
DANNY STRONG: Amazing
cast, isn't it?

00:30:59.210 --> 00:31:01.690
I mean, everyone
is so thoughtful

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:03.752
and well said and
incredible actors.

00:31:03.752 --> 00:31:05.710
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: What
was it, an assumption--

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:06.740
RACHELLE LEFEVRE:
Assumption of goodwill.

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.156
KELSEY GRAMMER:
That's nice, yeah.

00:31:08.156 --> 00:31:11.140
DANNY STRONG: I just had
one when I said that.

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.510
For me, what it
brought to me is what

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:16.990
I'm hoping that the
show brings to everyone,

00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:19.180
which is awareness.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:22.930
Awareness, empathy.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:27.880
We take a look into
many people that

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:31.270
don't get a voice in
a mainstream platform

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:33.250
to give them that voice.

00:31:33.250 --> 00:31:37.750
And for me, I'm fascinated
about learning about them

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:41.350
and about learning of
people that aren't myself.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:45.494
I have a lot of friends that
are funny Jewish writers.

00:31:45.494 --> 00:31:47.160
I don't need to write
a show about them.

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.574
What was that?

00:31:50.574 --> 00:31:52.698
KELSEY GRAMMER: I was just
thinking of Mrs. Maisel.

00:31:52.698 --> 00:31:53.920
DANNY STRONG: Yeah, yeah.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.120
Although I love that show.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.270
I mean, I really love that show.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:57.895
KELSEY GRAMMER: There
was room for one.

00:32:00.090 --> 00:32:02.680
DANNY STRONG: So we do
a transgender episode.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.935
We have a death penalty
two-part episode.

00:32:05.935 --> 00:32:08.460
We have an episode on
shaken baby syndrome.

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.750
I didn't know anything
about shaken baby syndrome.

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:14.140
I'm blown away by it, that
the science has been debunked.

00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.770
There are women in prison who
supposedly shook their babies

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:19.270
to death, but the
baby just could've

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:21.220
fallen and hit its head.

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:22.720
It's a tragedy.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:27.065
And so to be able to shine
a light on that issue,

00:32:27.065 --> 00:32:28.300
I'm proud of that.

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.240
But I just want to
shine the light.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.560
People need to know about this.

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:34.030
I didn't know about it.

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:36.580
And now we have a
platform to tell

00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:41.350
millions of people about it, and
we do it episode after episode.

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:44.390
So for me, it's
about that awareness.

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:45.910
And there's a bias.

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:48.250
There's a general
bias for people

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:50.290
that have been found
guilty, which is, well,

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:52.870
if you were found guilty and
you went through this process,

00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:54.460
you must be guilty, right?

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.920
And many of them
are guilty, right?

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:02.200
But for that small percentage
that isn't, perhaps

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.470
when they're now going
through the process of having

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:09.640
a retrial, if people in the
jury have seen the show,

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.870
they may be more empathetic.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:16.240
They just want to look
deeper into this issue,

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.500
into this case.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:18.760
Did this really happen?

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.580
What did really happen?

00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:24.170
And so many wrongful convictions
that we read about in the news,

00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.050
they happen because
of DNA evidence.

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:27.760
The person gets
released because of DNA

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.410
because that's conclusive.

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:32.480
Well, what about all the cases
where there is no DNA evidence?

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:35.170
And that is where
many of our storylines

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:36.260
come from those cases.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:40.270
So to give that awareness,
a sense of empathy

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:45.120
for individuals and for
the system in its totality

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.480
is the goal of the show.

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.420
And by the way, to have a
really entertaining show.

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:50.780
I mean, our show is exciting.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:51.280
It's cool.

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.330
It's funny.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:53.860
It's emotional.

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:56.140
It's not just this
relentless depressing,

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:58.150
oh my god, this is so horrible.

00:33:58.150 --> 00:33:59.530
And that's actually
the challenge

00:33:59.530 --> 00:34:02.184
with the subject material,
to be able to do that.

00:34:02.184 --> 00:34:03.600
KELSEY GRAMMER:
It's interesting--

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:07.180
I'm sitting here just thinking--

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.010
there's a great play
called "12 Angry Men."

00:34:11.626 --> 00:34:13.399
Did Paddy Chayefsky write it?

00:34:13.399 --> 00:34:15.389
DANNY STRONG: No, it
wasn't, but I don't know--

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:17.139
KELSEY GRAMMER: So Sidney
Lumet directed this movie.

00:34:17.139 --> 00:34:18.130
It's fantastic.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:19.969
But this is what we do.

00:34:19.969 --> 00:34:22.929
We call attention to things that
maybe need a second look, that

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:24.130
make us think a little bit.

00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:25.796
And it does, it serves
the same purpose.

00:34:25.796 --> 00:34:28.960
It's a fantastic compelling
film about a group of jurists

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.300
sitting in a room
and that dedication

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.580
that suddenly these
12 people have

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:36.620
to find the right thing out.

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:40.070
And I think doing the
right thing is still

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:47.100
a wonderful focal striving.

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:51.530
And I'm pleased to actually be
part of a striving situation.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:53.389
I'm not going to
offer any answers.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:56.510
I'm just going to, like I said,
hopefully some good questions.

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:59.730
And it's a pleasure
to be part of it.

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:00.452
Thank you.

00:35:00.452 --> 00:35:01.910
RACHELLE LEFEVRE:
Tell people also,

00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:05.960
it's a small, tiny little thing,
but when people are moved,

00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:07.880
they often ask, what can I do?

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.890
And something
interesting happened

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:12.350
after between the pilot and--

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:14.470
I became a citizen.

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:15.170
I'm Canadian.

00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:18.370
I became a United States
citizen a year ago today.

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:19.370
KELSEY GRAMMER: Welcome.

00:35:19.370 --> 00:35:20.536
RACHELLE LEFEVRE: Thank you.

00:35:20.536 --> 00:35:21.380
[LIGHT APPLAUSE]

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:24.240
Thank you.

00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.950
And because I had a green
card, I'm on the list--

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:30.420
I don't know how the system
is, it's a bureaucracy--

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.810
but I got on the list.

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:36.050
I get the jury summons to go
participate and be on a jury.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:40.490
And every year, I have to check
the box that says not a citizen

00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:43.070
and send it back because
I've had my green card.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.310
And we shot the pilot.

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:46.310
And then between the pilot
and doing the series,

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:50.540
I went home to Los
Angeles, and I got one.

00:35:53.170 --> 00:35:55.670
And it's really bad because
I ended up having something.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:57.020
I actually couldn't move,
and I couldn't do it.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:58.100
But I can't believe
I'm going to say this.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:59.010
It's hypocritical.

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:01.860
But when I got it,
my thought was, oh!

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:04.070
And I've just done this
show, and I'm a citizen.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.350
And I've just done this
show, and I shot the pilot

00:36:06.350 --> 00:36:08.970
and I kept thinking, how
can I help, what can I do?

00:36:08.970 --> 00:36:10.970
And this thing that I
would get in the mail that

00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:14.220
seemed like such an
irritation, such an,

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.892
oh, I've got jury duty.

00:36:15.892 --> 00:36:17.600
And my friends were
like, ugh, jury duty.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.510
And I went, oh, that thing
that comes in the mail

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:25.290
is an invitation to
participate in the process.

00:36:25.290 --> 00:36:28.160
And so even tiny little
things like that now my view

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.230
is sort of different.

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.730
Yeah.

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:32.938
KELSEY GRAMMER: It's a little
more than an invitation

00:36:32.938 --> 00:36:33.980
actually.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:37.690
It's sort of like there's
kind of a penalty involved

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:39.710
if you lie or don't show up.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:41.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:42.152 --> 00:36:43.610
RACHELLE LEFEVRE:
The invitation is

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:46.447
to participate with
all of what's in you

00:36:46.447 --> 00:36:47.780
and not just sit there, I guess.

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:48.470
Yeah.

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:50.803
KELSEY GRAMMER: It's supposed
to be a privilege, I know.

00:36:50.803 --> 00:36:52.390
But it is inconvenient
sometimes.

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:53.598
RACHELLE LEFEVRE: It's funny.

00:36:53.598 --> 00:36:55.580
We're having this amazing
engaged conversation

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:56.487
about social justice.

00:36:56.487 --> 00:36:58.820
And then you go home and you
get your jury summons, ugh.

00:37:01.013 --> 00:37:02.596
KELSEY GRAMMER: Very,
very nicely put.

00:37:02.596 --> 00:37:03.971
RACHELLE LEFEVRE:
Just a thought.

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.220
MALIKA SAADA SAAR: Well
now when people get that

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:08.678
and they've seen
the show, they can

00:37:08.678 --> 00:37:12.020
consider that there's something
like a forced confession

00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:14.060
or prosecutorial overreach.

00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:18.920
And those kinds of ways in
which we demystify, I think,

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:20.135
are important.

00:37:20.135 --> 00:37:23.190
And who we center in the
storytelling is so critical.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:24.950
So again, thank you.

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:27.420
And it's such a privilege
to have you here at Google.

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:27.860
RUSSELL HORNSBY: Thank you.

00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:28.370
RACHELLE LEFEVRE: Thank you.

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:29.453
KELSEY GRAMMER: Thank you.

00:37:29.453 --> 00:37:31.390
[APPLAUSE]
