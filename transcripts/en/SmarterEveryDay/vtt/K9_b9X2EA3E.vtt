00:00:00.379 --> 00:00:02.636
Hey it's me Destin, welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.636 --> 00:00:03.985
Simple question here.

00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:06.515
Do you know, like really know,

00:00:06.515 --> 00:00:08.636
what a kangaroo pouch looks like?

00:00:08.636 --> 00:00:12.423
Several years ago I was invited to Australia to help promote National Science Week

00:00:12.423 --> 00:00:14.965
with my friend Chris who has a website called Science Alert.

00:00:14.965 --> 00:00:17.425
As far as I knew kangaroo pouches look like,

00:00:17.425 --> 00:00:20.232
well you know, your jean pocket, like a little flap.

00:00:20.232 --> 00:00:24.926
We've all seen cartoons of kangaroos but is that what a kangaroo pouch looks like?

00:00:24.926 --> 00:00:28.799
My wife and I flew over to visit Chris and right off the bat this happened.

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:32.267
- There's a kangaroo!

00:00:32.267 --> 00:00:33.487
Look there he goes.

00:00:34.627 --> 00:00:35.622
- He's gonna come our way.

00:00:35.622 --> 00:00:36.334
(Destin) Oh man.

00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:37.497
- He's gonna cut right across in front of us.

00:00:38.717 --> 00:00:40.144
- Oh my goodness!

00:00:40.144 --> 00:00:41.052
Seriously!

00:00:41.052 --> 00:00:43.312
- You will see some roadkill, and now you'll know why.

00:00:44.772 --> 00:00:46.213
(Destin) Not really smart, are they.

00:00:53.373 --> 00:00:55.332
Man that is bizarre.

00:00:57.082 --> 00:00:59.044
- On cue as demanded.

00:00:59.044 --> 00:01:00.240
[laughs]

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:06.128
I called that in. I said I want a roo at the Chinese Embassy.

00:01:06.738 --> 00:01:08.059
(Destin) Oh yeah that is the Chinese..

00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:10.159
- 4:23.. Be there.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.620
[laughter]

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.619
- And yeah that's pretty cool but it didn't feel like a wild kangaroo

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.526
so I asked Chris to take us to a local area called the Tidbinbilla Nature Preserve

00:01:18.526 --> 00:01:20.956
where hundreds of kangaroos are known to hang out.

00:01:20.956 --> 00:01:21.829
You rolling?

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:22.471
- Rolling.

00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:28.122
- OK we spent all that time out in the wilderness and then we come back to grill some sausage and they're coming up to us,

00:01:28.122 --> 00:01:31.351
so obviously we have to see if we can find the pouch.

00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:32.687
- I'm not sticking my hand in there.

00:01:32.687 --> 00:01:33.868
- Just try it.

00:01:33.868 --> 00:01:36.207
- Did you see his nails? Like this..

00:01:36.207 --> 00:01:38.076
- But it's.. They're on the ground. Look, go for it.

00:01:40.206 --> 00:01:44.056
Look, you have a degree in biology and I don't.

00:01:44.056 --> 00:01:46.320
- I think he does have a small one. I think.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.029
- There you go.

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:53.231
- You want me to give him some more nibbles?

00:01:53.231 --> 00:01:54.106
You're good, you're good.

00:01:56.446 --> 00:01:59.464
[laughs]

00:02:00.674 --> 00:02:03.119
Today we learn kangaroos do not have pouches.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.446
Alright, I'm gonna sit this there...

00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:09.583
Alright, let me.. I'm just gonna reach under here.

00:02:09.583 --> 00:02:12.227
No no no, it's cool, it's cool dude.

00:02:13.577 --> 00:02:16.210
No need to poop, no need to poop.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.201
Here, I'm just feeling for your pouch

00:02:18.201 --> 00:02:19.408
that's all we're doing here.

00:02:20.428 --> 00:02:22.372
I'm very gentle.

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:25.543
I'm trying to get the pouch. I haven't..

00:02:25.543 --> 00:02:26.958
- That ain't the pouch buddy.

00:02:26.958 --> 00:02:28.596
- [laughs]

00:02:28.596 --> 00:02:30.222
I feel ribs.

00:02:31.862 --> 00:02:33.679
What've we got.

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:36.416
Bro, you're awesome.

00:02:38.916 --> 00:02:42.373
I can't find a pouch. [laughs]

00:02:42.373 --> 00:02:43.567
OK this is a..

00:02:44.345 --> 00:02:46.085
Do males have pouches?

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:47.430
- I don't know.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.175
- [laughs]

00:02:49.175 --> 00:02:50.365
This is my logic.

00:02:50.365 --> 00:02:52.516
Females have nipples and feed babies.

00:02:52.516 --> 00:02:55.609
Female kangaroos have pouches and hold joeys.

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.392
I have nipples and I don't feed babies.

00:02:58.392 --> 00:03:02.205
Therefore it's possible that male kangaroos have pouches

00:03:02.205 --> 00:03:03.773
but don't hold joeys.

00:03:03.773 --> 00:03:05.807
Even though I was touching this kangaroo directly

00:03:05.807 --> 00:03:07.952
the geometry felt a little weird.

00:03:07.952 --> 00:03:09.923
So the next day we're driving to Kangaroo Valley

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:11.181
I have a genius plan.

00:03:13.371 --> 00:03:17.575
OK we're randomly walking up to a house and we're gonna ask about kangaroos.

00:03:17.575 --> 00:03:18.264
And what was your name again?

00:03:18.264 --> 00:03:19.001
- Angela.

00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:23.102
- Angela, so Alan has told us something that's amazing about the kangaroo.

00:03:23.102 --> 00:03:23.795
What is it Alan?

00:03:23.795 --> 00:03:26.823
- Kangaroo is an amazing animal, it's unusual,

00:03:26.823 --> 00:03:29.272
it's unique in the world, it's a furred animal,

00:03:29.272 --> 00:03:35.667
four-legged and it's the only animal in the world that has its testicles in front of its penis.

00:03:38.027 --> 00:03:41.713
- I guess that explains why the geometry felt weird.

00:03:41.713 --> 00:03:43.200
If you know that, you have to know this.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.336
We were trying to.. I had a kangaroo,

00:03:45.336 --> 00:03:47.854
and he let me pat his belly.

00:03:47.854 --> 00:03:49.522
I couldn't find a pouch.

00:03:49.522 --> 00:03:50.894
Do male kangaroos have pouches?

00:03:50.894 --> 00:03:51.896
- No they don't have a pouch.

00:03:51.896 --> 00:03:53.756
- They don't. Only the females?

00:03:53.756 --> 00:03:54.638
- Only the females.

00:03:54.638 --> 00:03:56.899
- So.. How.. Are they born with the pouch?

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:59.061
- They're born with a pouch, yes.

00:03:59.061 --> 00:03:59.620
- Really.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.592
- Yeah they are. Well.. They develop a pouch.

00:04:01.592 --> 00:04:04.654
They're born, they're minute, they're smaller than your little finger

00:04:04.654 --> 00:04:07.727
and they're born through the vagina.

00:04:07.727 --> 00:04:11.214
And then they climb up the front of the kangaroo on the fur.

00:04:11.214 --> 00:04:14.028
She licks a track, they climb up and they go into the pouch.

00:04:14.028 --> 00:04:14.664
- Really.

00:04:14.664 --> 00:04:15.928
- Sometimes she'll have two or three.

00:04:15.928 --> 00:04:19.084
Then he attaches to the nipple.

00:04:19.084 --> 00:04:19.842
- To the teat.

00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:21.131
- Yeah he grows on it.

00:04:21.131 --> 00:04:23.920
And he can't be pulled off without tearing his mouth out

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.110
for about.. Oh I think it's around about two months.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.887
And then he starts to develop fur,

00:04:29.887 --> 00:04:31.991
and he becomes detached from the nipple.

00:04:31.991 --> 00:04:36.159
And when he's about four months old he starts to pop his head out,

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:38.294
look around and so on.

00:04:38.294 --> 00:04:41.527
- We went to a place called Josephine's Gallery &amp; Kangaroo Orphanage,

00:04:41.527 --> 00:04:42.801
which I thought was really cool

00:04:42.801 --> 00:04:45.624
because Josephine and her husband Terry raise these kangaroos

00:04:45.624 --> 00:04:48.752
that come to them from all over an area the size of Texas.

00:04:49.043 --> 00:04:51.852
They have to basically recreate what it's like in a womb

00:04:51.852 --> 00:04:55.014
in order to nurse these small kangaroos up to maturity.

00:04:55.014 --> 00:04:57.856
I learned from Terry, the husband, that the female kangaroo has four

00:04:57.856 --> 00:05:00.710
nipples on the inside of the pouch and even he wasn't sure if male

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.254
kangaroos had nipples or not.

00:05:04.114 --> 00:05:09.719
- Little wobbly... There you go.

00:05:11.521 --> 00:05:13.880
- So are all of yours females?

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.535
- Got all females at the moment, yep.

00:05:17.797 --> 00:05:19.432
(Destin) Where's the pouch you said?

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:20.791
- It's there.

00:05:21.824 --> 00:05:22.508
- Really.

00:05:22.547 --> 00:05:24.217
- Tuft of fur there.

00:05:24.637 --> 00:05:25.091
- Wow.

00:05:25.195 --> 00:05:26.763
- Yes it's quite compact.

00:05:27.018 --> 00:05:31.297
[background conversation]

00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:36.975
- What you doing babe?

00:05:36.975 --> 00:05:38.779
Oh you ready to go back to bed are you?

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:40.854
You looking for your pouch already?

00:05:40.854 --> 00:05:43.163
Oh yes yes yes I know I know. Hohoho. In you go.

00:05:43.163 --> 00:05:45.083
[laughter]

00:05:45.932 --> 00:05:49.095
Every time we feed her she has that little bit of time down

00:05:49.095 --> 00:05:52.108
and that'll just slowly increase as she gets a bit older.

00:05:52.108 --> 00:05:54.724
So she's only been hopping around just over a week

00:05:54.724 --> 00:05:58.521
she's been learning to stand, so she's doing pretty good aren't ya babe. Eh?

00:05:58.521 --> 00:06:01.472
- So that's cute and all but we still haven't looked inside a kangaroo pouch.

00:06:01.472 --> 00:06:05.116
So we went back to Sydney, we called up the big guns, Taronga Zoo.

00:06:05.116 --> 00:06:06.899
Across the bay in Sydney, it's awesome.

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:09.191
We took a ferry, all kinds of Australian wildlife,

00:06:09.191 --> 00:06:12.043
you take a cable car up to the top, overlooking the zoo

00:06:12.043 --> 00:06:14.786
and then we schedule one-on-one time with Sam,

00:06:14.786 --> 00:06:16.539
the zookeeper. Is that the proper term?

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:17.233
- That's right.

00:06:17.233 --> 00:06:18.574
- Alright and this is Penny right?

00:06:18.574 --> 00:06:19.245
- Yeah.

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:20.497
- And so you said..

00:06:22.497 --> 00:06:23.947
Stay there Penny.

00:06:24.677 --> 00:06:25.480
We're gonna go..

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.552
Where's your pouch?

00:06:28.102 --> 00:06:28.935
Oop, there it is.

00:06:30.285 --> 00:06:31.851
There it is. Oop!

00:06:33.061 --> 00:06:34.336
Little present there.

00:06:34.336 --> 00:06:36.528
Can you hold the pouch open with one hand?

00:06:36.528 --> 00:06:38.075
- Sure. Let me just get some more sultanas.

00:06:38.075 --> 00:06:39.988
- Sultanas are raisins right?

00:06:39.988 --> 00:06:40.662
- Yeah.

00:06:40.662 --> 00:06:41.664
- Alright.

00:06:45.024 --> 00:06:46.468
That's the pouch.

00:06:47.748 --> 00:06:49.531
Wow. Let me see if I can.

00:06:49.531 --> 00:06:52.656
So its.. That's why I couldn't find it, it was very small.

00:06:55.466 --> 00:06:58.698
So you can.. Man that's amazing.

00:06:58.698 --> 00:07:00.736
So back in there, at the very back of it,

00:07:00.736 --> 00:07:05.057
I can see. I probably can't see it on the uh..

00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:05.738
Yeah look at that.

00:07:05.738 --> 00:07:07.520
There's white and black spots in the back.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.814
Thank you girl, I'm sorry.

00:07:09.814 --> 00:07:10.937
- Get it?

00:07:10.937 --> 00:07:13.848
- Yeah. So it's really small and it stretches out.

00:07:13.848 --> 00:07:18.282
I thought it was.. As an American I always had the misconception

00:07:18.282 --> 00:07:20.728
that it was like a pocket right here on the belly

00:07:20.728 --> 00:07:22.539
because that's the way it is on cartoons.

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:24.127
Thank you for showing me that.

00:07:24.127 --> 00:07:25.044
- No problem

00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:26.410
- Bam! We just learned something.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.571
I always thought kangaroo pouches were kind of like pockets on your pants.

00:07:29.571 --> 00:07:31.423
They're not. They're way cooler than that.

00:07:31.423 --> 00:07:35.370
Before I show you footage of my family feeding giraffes at Taronga Zoo

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.562
I want to mention the sponsor.

00:07:36.562 --> 00:07:39.598
They made my quest for marsupial orifices possible.

00:07:39.598 --> 00:07:42.024
Audible.com sponsors Smarter Every Day.

00:07:42.024 --> 00:07:45.147
Just so you know I'm not lying here, I listen to all kinds of audio books.

00:07:45.147 --> 00:07:46.076
That's my library.

00:07:46.076 --> 00:07:49.459
You can go to audible.com/smarter and get any book you want for free.

00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:51.690
audible.com/smarter, that easy.

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.617
You can get Smarter Every Day by listening to audio books.

00:07:53.617 --> 00:07:55.008
I do it on my way to work.

00:07:55.008 --> 00:07:56.468
Pretty cool way to get smarter.

00:07:56.468 --> 00:07:59.368
Anyway, I listened to Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card

00:07:59.368 --> 00:08:01.722
as we flew over the Pacific Ocean to Australia.

00:08:01.722 --> 00:08:04.185
Really good book, but you can get whatever you want.

00:08:04.185 --> 00:08:05.700
audible.com/smarter.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.705
One more thing.

00:08:06.705 --> 00:08:08.183
Um, thanks.

00:08:08.183 --> 00:08:12.041
Thanks for watching a video about me running around Australia

00:08:12.041 --> 00:08:15.049
trying to find a specific marsupial orifice.

00:08:15.049 --> 00:08:17.888
That's really weird, and you're watching this whole video, so thank you.

00:08:17.888 --> 00:08:20.271
Please consider subscribing if that added value to your life.

00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:24.906
If not, have fun watching my family feed giraffes carrots.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.764
I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:08:26.764 --> 00:08:27.732
Have a good one.

00:08:33.396 --> 00:08:34.261
What's the term?

00:08:34.261 --> 00:08:35.074
- Prehensile.

00:08:35.074 --> 00:08:37.784
- Prehensile, meaning they can direct it.

00:08:39.744 --> 00:08:41.402
Prehensile.. wow.

00:08:41.591 --> 00:08:43.506
- So it's very hand-like we say.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:50.525
- Oh can we.. I want to hold and see if they can pull against me. Is that possible

00:08:50.525 --> 00:08:51.617
or is that a bad thing to do?

00:08:51.617 --> 00:08:55.597
Of course she gave me a small carrot to do it. [laugh]

00:08:55.597 --> 00:08:56.736
- .. saliva you're getting there.

00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:57.678
- Oh my goodness.

00:08:57.678 --> 00:08:58.756
- I tried it.

00:08:58.756 --> 00:08:59.625
- Yeah.
