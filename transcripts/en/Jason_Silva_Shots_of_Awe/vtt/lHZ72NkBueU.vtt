[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:16.200
We talk a lot about
the power of story.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.490
You know, as tool and
technique for transformation,

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.780
for interpersonal persuasion.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.580
To feel upgraded, to
experience catharsis.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.430
How does it work, right?

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.180
When it works, it's
such a powerful thing.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.630
I think stories are a kind
of cognitive technology.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.640
They literally
colonize the brain.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.800
They literally take over.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.140
They pattern our ability to
discern the sense impressions

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.450
as the come in.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.410
They are a deciphering mechanism
to abstract meaningful patterns

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.950
out of our lives.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.280
And so stories are
so powerful, so

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.770
important is this tool, this
meta-pattern, that it plays out

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.555
again and again and again
in every single variation

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:55.410
and variable.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.246
Joseph Campbell talks about
the hero with 1,000 faces.

00:00:58.246 --> 00:01:00.120
It's always the same
hero because it's always

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.640
teaching us the same lesson.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.950
It's always providing a map
to turn every experience

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.420
into a meaningful experience.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.030
I almost feel that human beings
are embedded in their stories.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.140
The human race-- who
we are-- is a story.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.140
We are a narrative.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.490
Mind is narrative.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.240
Consciousness is a
self-reflecting awareness

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.310
of pattern, of story.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.500
So I think it's innate.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.570
We wouldn't be us without it.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.650
It's a powerful thing.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.910
It's a cathartic thing.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.060
It's a thing worth
celebrating, worth framing,

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.850
and worth talking about,
distilling, dissecting,

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.470
exploring stories.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.680
Hey guys, be sure to check
out The Dictionary of Obscure

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.430
Sorrows, which is literally
a compendium of words

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.087
we've never heard before used
to describe elusive feelings

00:01:47.087 --> 00:01:48.545
that we can barely
ever articulate,

00:01:48.545 --> 00:01:50.570
but we will surely recognize.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.720
Check it out.
