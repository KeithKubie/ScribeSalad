00:00:03.672 --> 00:00:06.140
TODD KERPELMAN: Hello, I
do believe we are live.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:07.490
How about that?

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.540
Sorry for the delay, it's
all Colt's fault.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.080
So we are here today--

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.140
COLT MCANLIS: It's true.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.800
It's completely true.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:15.130
I'm sorry.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.530
WOLFF DOBSON: It is,
in fact, true.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.270
COLT MCANLIS: Sorry, internet.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.610
WOLFF DOBSON: Didn't think we
would go there this early in

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.000
the broadcast.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.660
COLT MCANLIS: No, it's
OK, call me out.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.060
I will apologize for
the internet.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.370
It will not be not be the first
time I've done that.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.780
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Look them in
the eyes, now apologize.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.370
TODD KERPELMAN: We are sorry,
internet, for making you wait.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.010
COLT MCANLIS: Sorry, 3.6 billion
people, my fault.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.230
TODD KERPELMAN: So, this is
the Google Games Chat.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.020
We need a better,
catchier name.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.210
I had Google Games Gab, but I
don't think that's better.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.420
WOLFF DOBSON: No, that
is not better.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.090
TODD KERPELMAN: So we'll
work on that.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.860
Hopefully by the next time we do
this we'll actually have a

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.150
decent title for you.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.510
WOLFF DOBSON: The Google
Games Coffee Clatch,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.210
something like that.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.350
You're the only one with
coffee though.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.340
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah,
actually it's tea.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.144
COLT MCANLIS: Google
Gameville?

00:00:52.144 --> 00:00:54.750
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, so anyway,
let's start with the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.400
introductions.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.010
So hi, I'm Todd Kerpelman.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.210
Hopefully there's a little label
underneath my face that

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.410
you can actually see that will
show you my name so you know

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.940
how to spell it.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.790
Let's see, over here to my
right, your left probably,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.990
this is Colt McAnlis.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.160
COLT MCANLIS: Hello,
how are you doing?

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.040
And if you would like to
contribute to our Hotline Fund

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.730
Relief, call the number live
on your screen right here.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.120
Operators are standing
by to take your call.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.130
TODD KERPELMAN: Or ask a
question on the little

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.005
moderator link below.

00:01:22.005 --> 00:01:23.025
WOLFF DOBSON: Right.

00:01:23.025 --> 00:01:25.780
TODD KERPELMAN: Let's see, to
my immediate left, this is

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.150
Daniel Wolff Dobson.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.270
He is our Hangouts guy.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.860
I'm wearing the shirt
in [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.950
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, I don't
know why you're wearing my

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.100
product shirt, but that's OK.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.896
TODD KERPELMAN: Well,
it's warm down here.

00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:38.120
For those of you not in the
Bay Area, the difference

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.720
between San Francisco and
Mountain View in the summer is

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.640
about 25 degrees.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.070
So every San Francisco resident
has to have a heavy

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.570
jacket or a sweater or something
that they put on at

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.770
the beginning of the day.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.670
And then somewhere in the
commute down, you

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.090
have to take it off.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.070
COLT MCANLIS: It's layers.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.050
WOLFF DOBSON: But by the end
of the day, Todd is not

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.850
wearing anything.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.845
TODD KERPELMAN: And
gradually--

00:01:57.845 --> 00:02:00.040
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It keeps
getting hotter.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.550
COLT MCANLIS: Especially when
Todd's wearing nothing, that's

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.785
the hottest part.

00:02:03.785 --> 00:02:06.220
TODD KERPELMAN: I was just going
to say, it's a very good

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.280
thing we didn't schedule this at
like 4:30-5:00 PM, because

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.690
then we'd have to have--

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.894
WOLFF DOBSON: It's a whole
different kind of hangout is

00:02:11.894 --> 00:02:11.990
what you're saying.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.280
COLT MCANLIS: Speedo hour.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.670
TODD KERPELMAN: Yes, then we'd
have to have age restrictions

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.510
and all sorts of fun
stuff like this.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.860
WOLFF DOBSON: Wow.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.370
TODD KERPELMAN: And then
to my far left,

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.700
we have John Mccutchan.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.490
You've been here at Google
for a grand total of

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.250
two and a half days?

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.750
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.880
COLT MCANLIS: 40 hours?

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.180
That's the perfect time to
put him on the internet.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.760
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah, and we
said that's great, and you're

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.980
going to go on TV.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.990
So, John, what are you going
to be doing here?

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.030
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I'm going to
be working on Native Client

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.330
and Dart, bringing better
games to the web.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.980
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.186
COLT MCANLIS: I think
that's good.

00:02:44.186 --> 00:02:46.070
TODD KERPELMAN: It so happens
we like the web.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.955
WOLFF DOBSON: We're big fans.

00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:47.500
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.900
COLT MCANLIS: I don't know if
it's going to last though.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.085
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah,
it's a fad.

00:02:50.085 --> 00:02:52.860
WOLFF DOBSON: I mean, there's
a story here where I saw one

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.710
of the first web browsers
on my NeXT in like 1992.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.390
And I was like, this is
completely disorganized.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.980
How will you be able-- you're
not going to be

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.780
able to find anything.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:01.800
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Who's going to
organize our information?

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.475
WOLFF DOBSON: No, I didn't think
somebody should organize

00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:05.530
this, I thought this is
completely disorganized, it'll

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.570
never catch on.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.460
I deleted the browser.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.080
It was really bad.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.220
TODD KERPELMAN: There was a time
when Gopher was just way

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.675
more convenient.

00:03:12.675 --> 00:03:13.110
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, that
was the thing.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.210
It was like Gopher, you knew
where things were.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.330
TODD KERPELMAN: Things were
nicely organized.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.410
COLT MCANLIS: And much like the
Michael Jordan story, the

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.645
owners of Google knew that you
said this is impossible.

00:03:21.645 --> 00:03:24.490
And that gave them the ambition
to win the gold medal

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.530
and launch a company.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.150
Sorry, I'm a big Olympics fan,
so everything this week is

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.220
very Olympics-oriented.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.192
TODD KERPELMAN: All right.

00:03:30.192 --> 00:03:32.240
WOLFF DOBSON: I actually did see
Sergey and Larry when they

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.720
came out to where I was
in grad school.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.533
They gave a talk about this
company they were thinking

00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:36.840
about founding.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.980
COLT MCANLIS: Thinking
about founding?

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.030
WOLFF DOBSON: Well,
they were gonna.

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.980
They were just kind going on
this little academic tour.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.970
TODD KERPELMAN: Interesting.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.515
WOLFF DOBSON: And I remember
scratching my chin thinking

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:44.545
wow, is that going to work?

00:03:44.545 --> 00:03:44.820
I don't even know.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.116
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: It's
so disorganized.

00:03:47.116 --> 00:03:49.070
WOLFF DOBSON: There's not enough
understanding in that.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.090
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: At
Microtransactions, yes.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.770
COLT MCANLIS: We should actually
talk about something.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.090
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, we should
talk about something.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.200
COLT MCANLIS: All right,
moderator, yeah.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.400
WOLFF DOBSON: We should
talk about games.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.790
TODD KERPELMAN: So what's
new in NACo Land?

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.310
Actually, why don't you start,
for people who don't know what

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.890
Native Client is, give
us the pitch.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:02.510
COLT MCANLIS: Absolutely.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.190
So, Native Client is a
technology that allows you to

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.560
run C and C++ code in your
web browser, as safely as

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.830
JavaScript, no plug-in
required.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.400
Which is fantastic, because this
means that there's this

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.720
perfect little critical point
between developers who pride

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.920
themselves on reaching the
maximum amount of users

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.210
running on lots of platforms but
still want the executional

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.580
control and the speed required
to be able to

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.830
actually execute the code.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.060
So the critical thing is that
you can actually run Native

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.660
Client code.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.060
So this is C++ code, you've
got an existing code base,

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.250
you've got years of development,
engineers have

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.570
been trained, millions of
dollars in the code base.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.380
You can run it right in the
web browser without the

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.100
plugin, which is typically where
your C++ code on the web

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.720
comes in right now.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.210
And of course, most of those
you install the plugin and

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.460
than all of sudden you have
like 50 new toolbar

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.160
modifications to search for
gophers, and cats, and new

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.090
deals on gophercat.com.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.560
So Native Client's a fantastic
technology that we have in

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.110
Chrome, and we've been seeing
really good adoption with it.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.720
I think since our official
launch in December of last

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.140
year, we've seen over two dozen
games shipped using

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.440
Native Client technology
inside of Chrome.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.410
Which is great, right?

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.160
I mean, these are games that
span from the indie, to

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.680
mobile, to console as well.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.870
We have actually a full suite
of games that have come to

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.470
Native Client from consoles
like the Xbox 360.

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.800
And they're getting the same
performance, the same

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.530
graphics, which is really
inspiring to see.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.190
When you see that kind of
power and that kind of

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.040
leverage inside of the web
browser, it's awesome, I love

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.012
working on it.

00:05:30.012 --> 00:05:31.960
TODD KERPELMAN: So
let's say I'm a

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.720
traditional PC game developer.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.780
Why go from having my
EXEs to running

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:38.970
something in a browser?

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.065
What do I get out of that?

00:05:40.065 --> 00:05:42.240
COLT MCANLIS: Well, first
off is reach, right?

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.690
I mean, a lot of developers,
when you're executing in code

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.630
in the PC space you have a
certain number of digital

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.510
distribution silos that
you're locked into.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.260
Where we are in my opinion in
the digital distribution age

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.350
of games right now is really
just a one-off from where we

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.960
were a few years ago in
the retail market.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.580
Where effectively, developers
spent a lot of time scrapping

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.690
and fighting for market share
and visibility and eyeballs.

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.640
We're in a better place because
we're digital, but we

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.250
really haven't fixed
that model.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.680
Developers are still spending
tons and tons of time fighting

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.080
for small pieces of user
attention in these larger

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.980
digital distribution
ecosystems.

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.370
The web fixes that.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:24.460
The web isn't about a single
digital distribution silo,

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.900
it's about any link anywhere.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.890
I can send a link to you and you
can go watch a cat skiing

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:33.170
on some little tiny skis made
out of watermelons right now.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.140
And then you can share it with
your friend, and share it with

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.490
that friend, and it can go
everywhere and there's no

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.490
restrictions on that.

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.590
So when you're talking about
gaming on the web, what you're

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:43.920
really talking about is the
ability to touch every human

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.860
on the planet.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.690
And put your product,
your artwork, your

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:47.870
game in front of them.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.450
And have them experience that
and have them create an

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.590
emotional attachment and then
turn around and be able to

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:53.710
share it with everyone else.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.120
So it's really a powerful
medium.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.640
For those game developers who
understand what the web

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.460
brings, it allows them to break
out of a lot of these

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.370
molds that there's a lot
of frustration with.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.790
TODD KERPELMAN: Your long-term
goal for game developers is I

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.220
can share a game as
easily as I can

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.170
share a link to a medium?

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.930
COLT MCANLIS: Absolutely.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:10.800
Can you imagine that?

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.820
Like really, imagine this where
you've got an MMO and

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:16.940
you're sitting there playing
inside of your web browser and

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.400
you need one of your
buddies to join.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.955
And you pop up your
chat console and

00:07:19.955 --> 00:07:21.030
you send him a chat.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.800
And that goes right to him, he
can click on the link, it goes

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.267
right into the game, loads the
game, into his character, and

00:07:26.267 --> 00:07:28.420
he's right in the instance
with you.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:33.090
And that's no install, no load
time, hypothetically.

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:34.010
We'd like to optimize
for that.

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:36.440
WOLFF DOBSON: In a world where
assets are incredibly

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.610
infinitesimal.

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.530
COLT MCANLIS: Or asset transfer
has been optimized in

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:41.790
the correct way.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.230
We see a lot of these console
development systems, you get

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.680
seven gigabytes, that takes
time to transfer.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.310
But we have to get into--

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.060
and this is, again, another
harp I can get on about

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.000
digital distribution silos, but
I'll keep that for later.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.280
Separate discussion.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.770
In any case, that's
the main thing.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.260
If you can actually share a game
and experience a game as

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.660
easy as sharing a link, that's
the power of the internet.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.760
That's really what
we're here to do.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.820
And that's really what game
developers have been queueing

00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:08.476
on and releasing the power
of Native Client with.

00:08:08.476 --> 00:08:09.790
TODD KERPELMAN: Pretty
cool, yeah.

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:10.890
COLT MCANLIS: Or at least
that's my pitch.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:11.765
TODD KERPELMAN: That's
a good pitch.

00:08:11.765 --> 00:08:13.270
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I think
it is possible to

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:14.740
really reduce load times.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:18.510
If you design a game around
the idea that--

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.560
let's say an MMO.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.690
If you compartmentalize and
chunk the world up, you should

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:25.390
be able to stream the immediate
world where the

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.400
player is landing very,
very quickly.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.780
And then slowly propagate and
fill out the rest of the world

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.360
in the background.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.169
COLT MCANLIS: And we've seen
success with this, right?

00:08:34.169 --> 00:08:37.980
I mean, Blizzard created Try
WoW which was effectively a

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.620
downloadable, free, streamable
client for their World of

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.929
Warcraft MMO.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:43.340
Effectively, if I recall
correctly,

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.650
it was like 25 megs.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:46.530
You would download it, you
could actually play up to

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:48.820
level 20 for free
with this thing.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.000
And what you'd do is you would
download it, and all it

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.500
basically gave you was your
character creation screen,

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.990
knowing that a user's
going to sit there

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.450
and tweak with stuff.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.230
And while they're playing, it
would be streaming in data in

00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:57.630
the background.

00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:58.665
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Exactly.

00:08:58.665 --> 00:09:00.570
WOLFF DOBSON: I mean really, if
you think about it, this is

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:05.770
the problem that we've been
going at for 15 years.

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:08.350
And the PlayStation 2 was all
about well, we have all these

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.360
different streaming paths
that are going through.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.160
And we have to make sure that
we're actually streaming the

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.390
textures in live as we're
rendering it.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:18.180
And you always had to build in
the lag from oh, we've got to

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.820
get it off disk, then we get
it into memory, from memory

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.425
onto the graphics runner.

00:09:21.425 --> 00:09:23.620
We've been doing this
for 20 years now.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.920
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah, it's
definitely an old problem and,

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.530
in fact, solved very well.

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.110
I don't know if you guys
remember playing Jak and

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:30.680
Daxter back on the PS2, this
had probably one of the

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.440
greatest solutions I've
ever seen for this.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.540
So it was a live streaming
world, probably one of the

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.900
most successful and one of the
first to really do it.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.250
I don't know if you guys ever
noticed, but if you like just

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.920
took off in one direction as
fast as you could go, and the

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.990
data wasn't streamed in yet, the
designers actually put in

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.390
something funny.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:48.510
They'd trip your character.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.220
Your character would fall over
and play like a 30-second get

00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:52.925
up animation allowing
enough time for

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:53.795
the data to be streamed.

00:09:53.795 --> 00:09:54.310
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: That's great.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:55.245
COLT MCANLIS: That's
brilliant.

00:09:55.245 --> 00:09:56.885
WOLFF DOBSON: It's like
those doors in Mass

00:09:56.885 --> 00:09:58.885
Effect, or the elevators.

00:09:58.885 --> 00:09:59.665
TODD KERPELMAN: The elevators.

00:09:59.665 --> 00:10:01.090
WOLFF DOBSON: Ah,
the elevators.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.210
Man, this elevator's
taking forever.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.010
Why did we ever install this?

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.100
COLT MCANLIS: Why is floor
two nine million

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.220
feet above floor one?

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.990
WOLFF DOBSON: Why didn't
we install a pole

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.900
just to slide down?

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:10.935
I don't understand.

00:10:10.935 --> 00:10:12.840
No, but it is an old problem.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.150
And it's a problem--

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.510
well, and I can go all the way
back to-- when I was working

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.600
on basketball for the Dreamcast
where you would put

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.400
the ball up.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.730
And we didn't have the physics
running all the way forward to

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.250
know whether or not the ball
is going to go in.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:27.610
So we had to stream four or five
different audio clips.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.830
It was like it's in, it's
off the rim, no

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:32.600
good, all these things.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.810
And then by the time the ball
was coming down the arch, we

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.660
knew we had five of them
in memory, and then

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:39.370
it wouldn't go in.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:40.750
And then we'd go ah, it
was this one, and

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:41.850
then we'd play that.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.360
And every now and then we were
spectacularly wrong.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.730
So we'd jump up and swat it
away, and then the commentary

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.810
just wouldn't say anything
because we had nothing ready.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:52.190
COLT MCANLIS: So let
me ask you this.

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:54.800
Do you feel that in the modern
age of development we have

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.500
right now that users still
benefit from streaming of

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:01.610
assets and being closer to
instant load as possible?

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:03.730
Do you think that's something
that users actually care

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:07.155
about, that will actually drive
sales for developers?

00:11:07.155 --> 00:11:08.800
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes.

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:09.720
Yeah, I do.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.420
TODD KERPELMAN: I
mean, I think it

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.870
depends on the system.

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:18.340
Like if I'm going through a
traditional model where I go

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:21.450
on to Steam and I say hey, I'm
going to buy this thing.

00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:24.590
Actually, at that point I've
bought it and I've sort of

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.160
accepted that maybe, depending
on my internet connection, it

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.480
might take a few hours until
I can actually play.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.050
If I could play it right away,
or if I could start playing

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:35.850
and then it asked me for
my credit card or

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:36.710
something like that.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:37.950
You know, I bet you--

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.330
I'm going to say I bet
you could get a few

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:41.348
more sales that way.

00:11:41.348 --> 00:11:43.630
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Let me give a
scenario, and I think that we

00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:45.280
could all relate to this.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.050
You get home from work
and you've got 30

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.880
minutes to play a game.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.370
You don't want to spend 10 to
15 minutes of those waiting

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.100
for everything to load up, and
get everything started.

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:56.620
You just want to drop in, play
your 30 minutes, and get out.

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.450
So streaming absolutely
will help there.

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:02.370
And it's going to make our
very busy schedules

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:03.730
have room for games.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:06.720
And really high quality games,
too, not just small games.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:07.520
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, I think

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.820
streaming and caching together.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.385
Once you have it downloaded,
then you are able to drop back

00:12:13.385 --> 00:12:15.530
in instantaneously.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:17.870
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I think if you
organize your game world in

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:21.180
such a way that the immediate
assets you need are five to 10

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.870
megs, and then you're streaming
in after that, I

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.775
think you could still do
it without caching.

00:12:25.775 --> 00:12:27.270
TODD KERPELMAN: I don't know.

00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:28.990
I guess that's assuming
everyone's got a very good

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:29.780
internet connection.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:30.860
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yes, yeah.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.810
TODD KERPELMAN: I would love
it if it started streaming

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:33.520
while I was playing.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:35.730
And then when I was done
playing, it just kept

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:36.360
downloading all the game data.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.290
WOLFF DOBSON: Just kept
chewing on it.

00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:40.370
Well, I think Steam
does that, right?

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:44.360
You can start playing Episode
2 when it's half downloaded,

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:45.480
and then it'll keep--

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.390
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: They have
some checkpoints where

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:48.350
you can start it.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.780
COLT MCANLIS: Well, I think Todd
actually brought up the

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.660
crux of the situation here.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:53.990
We're definitely at an
inflection point.

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.500
I think if you're a game
developer right now and you

00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:59.240
haven't read the millions of
articles that are talking

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.390
about the monetization
differences in the mobile

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.130
space, then you're living
under a rock.

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.890
Right now we're seeing lots of
studies showing freemium is

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:09.340
definitely dominating in terms
of monetization over

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:10.460
premium-style content.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.000
Like there's still the niche for
it, they're still there,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.730
especially in the Steam platform
where AAA hardcore

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:17.980
developers work in that
premium model.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.580
But I think Todd really caught
on to it where you said you

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:23.160
started with if this is a
premium content, I expect to

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.240
buy it and take some time.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.820
But if this is a freemium-style
content--

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.530
WOLFF DOBSON: I just want
it to be there.

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:27.930
COLT MCANLIS: Right.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.840
And so that's where I think
the crux is right there.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:34.870
Even with the monetization
methods that we're seeing have

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:37.200
huge success in the industry
right now, the freemium-style

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:40.330
content, we're still sort of
gated by this mental model

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:43.090
that consumers have given
from our silos.

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:45.140
That I'm going to click a button
and then it's going to

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:47.730
take some time to download, and
then I can play it later.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.110
And that's where, again, I think
I come back to wanting

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.680
the webification of games.

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.060
Wanting the ability to send
someone a link and have them

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.290
instant load it without having
all this install and

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:58.540
everything.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:13:59.390
That's really a dream of mine.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:01.490
That's something that John and I
hopefully will work on a lot

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:02.380
more in the coming years.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:04.540
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, I mean,
I also just like applying

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:05.360
patches, too.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.860
COLT MCANLIS: Oh, yeah.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.890
WOLFF DOBSON: Anybody who's
ever left their favorite

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:12.390
console or whatever, or their
game, alone for a while,

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:14.855
they're like yeah, I haven't
played this in forever-- aw.

00:14:14.855 --> 00:14:15.890
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: And there
goes your 30 minutes.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.610
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, exactly.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.400
So definitely all that stuff.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:22.640
I do find it interesting though,
especially for mobile

00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:27.290
gaming, I kind of do want it
all on the device before I

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:28.280
walk out the door.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.600
Because I don't actually
know what my

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.600
connectivity is going to be.

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.210
COLT MCANLIS: That's
fair, yeah.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:31.940
Absolutely.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:33.770
WOLFF DOBSON: Especially for--

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:35.440
I'm going to Alaska
pretty soon.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.220
So no idea what my internet
connection is going to be.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:38.734
TODD KERPELMAN: I don't know
what your coverage

00:14:38.734 --> 00:14:39.630
is going to be there.

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.900
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm going to be
adjusting the moose antler.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.150
Yeah, OK.

00:14:46.372 --> 00:14:48.210
COLT MCANLIS: Moose internet
connection.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:48.910
Where do you plug-in?

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:50.280
Just get a moose.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.030
WOLFF DOBSON: I'm very,
very sorry to all

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:55.311
of our Alaska watchers.

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:56.470
TODD KERPELMAN: If they're
watching then

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.400
they have good internet.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.020
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, I actually
am going out to the national

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.860
parks and stuff where the
coverage is going to be poor.

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.185
And I'm bringing my
Nexus 7 with me.

00:15:05.185 --> 00:15:07.010
COLT MCANLIS: Well, I think
that's just the next place we

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.210
should put out Google Fiber is
the Alaskan wildlife park.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.580
WOLFF DOBSON: Is Denali.

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:14.680
Three fourths of the way up
Denali there's like a bunch of

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.796
code books.

00:15:16.796 --> 00:15:17.880
COLT MCANLIS: I think
it works.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.110
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: We'll send
Pitbull up there.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.310
There you go.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.350
WOLFF DOBSON: Because
he's already in

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:24.258
Kodiak, it would be awesome.

00:15:24.258 --> 00:15:25.650
COLT MCANLIS: It's all right,
we're completely off-base.

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:26.880
TODD KERPELMAN: No, that's
not, that's fine.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.100
WOLFF DOBSON: So next
question, Todd.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.790
TODD KERPELMAN: Well, I was
actually going to touch on the

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:34.230
freemium model.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.685
Do you feel like that's the
future for all games?

00:15:36.685 --> 00:15:39.260
COLT MCANLIS: Oh, absolutely
not, no, no, no.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.660
The way I correlate freemium
versus premium is much like

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.910
television versus movies
right now.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:48.190
Like there is always a market
that someone wants that rich,

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:51.070
immersive, interactive
environment, and that is never

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:51.660
going to go away.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.710
I think the fact that Steam
sales and consoles actually

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:59.360
stayed relatively strong
considering how much attention

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.660
and money is now in the mobile
market is proof that there is

00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.710
definitely a market there and
that's not going to go away.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.480
That's your movie, that's
you're AAA content.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.010
That's your sit down, play
some time, spend a good

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.150
weekend ignoring the kids,
shooting some people in the

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:12.250
face, right?

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:12.630
That's there.

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:13.865
TODD KERPELMAN: Good
wholesome fun.

00:16:13.865 --> 00:16:14.930
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah, good
wholesome family fun.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:18.620
WOLFF DOBSON: I do that even
without a console.

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.550
COLT MCANLIS: What I think we're
seeing right now is that

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.960
we've never had an opportunity
for anything but that--

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.670
that's been the only medium.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:29.230
It's effectively like only ever
having bookstores for the

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:31.940
first 20 centuries of human
existence, and then one day

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:34.190
someone starts handing
out leaflets.

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.040
And it's like oh wait, I can
actually get some data in a

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.650
very short condensed form, and
then go on back with my day.

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:43.160
And because we're a very
attention interrupted society

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.950
right now, these devices
we have in our

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:46.210
pocket are very much--

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:48.350
I'm standing in line at the
DMV, I'm waiting to get

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:49.470
punched in the face.

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:51.920
Let me whip out and play some
games and then go back.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.820
It's very much small
installments of

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:54.770
little pieces of data.

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:56.400
I think that's just a different
ecosystem and a

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.820
different model, a different
environment.

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:00.080
And they both have their place,
especially when you

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.240
look at social games in
social networks and

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.570
who that caters to.

00:17:03.570 --> 00:17:06.349
I thought Zynga's presentation
a couple years ago at GDC was

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:09.460
completely eye-opening when
their lead designer had talked

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.490
about her mental model
of designing games.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:13.304
WOLFF DOBSON: I remember that.

00:17:13.304 --> 00:17:16.690
COLT MCANLIS: Understanding that
when a house mother sits

00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:18.410
down to play a game, she's
just had a kid

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:19.609
yelling at her for hours.

00:17:19.609 --> 00:17:22.960
She doesn't want to sit down and
try 15 times to shoot an

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.550
alien in the face.

00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:25.800
She want something that's
progressive and moving

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.160
forward, and something that
makes her feel like she's

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.830
getting investment
for her time.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:30.800
That was really eye opening.

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.230
That was a medium that, as game
developers, we'd never

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:34.780
considered before.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.510
And I think we just have
more avenues to

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:37.410
explore these voices.

00:17:37.410 --> 00:17:38.540
Now, I don't think anything
is going to be the

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.400
one dominant future.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:41.710
Just like anything it'll
ebb and flow.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.100
I think there's going to be
points for all of them.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:45.860
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: An analogy that
I've really liked is like

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.600
people are always going to
want to go to a five-star

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.300
restaurant, and they're going to
want to go to a sports bar

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:51.550
type restaurant, and they're
going to want to go to

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:52.690
McDonald's.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:54.280
These are the different tiers.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.490
And just because McDonald's is
out there and cheap doesn't

00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:00.000
mean that everyone wants to eat
every meal at McDonald's.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.760
You want different experiences,
and you're going

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:03.770
to get it with different
content.

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.140
COLT MCANLIS: Also, by the way,
don't take a McDonald's

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:07.620
hamburger into the
steak house.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:08.290
Really bad.

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:09.940
Like, they frown on
that entirely.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.685
WOLFF DOBSON: Wait, I've
lost this metaphor.

00:18:11.685 --> 00:18:13.450
Does this mean I shouldn't
bring my freemium game--

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.056
TODD KERPELMAN: Don't
bring your phone.

00:18:15.056 --> 00:18:17.320
WOLFF DOBSON: I can't bring
my cell phone into

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.440
Mass Effect, got it.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:21.600
COLT MCANLIS: That's actually
a great question.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.910
So what was the latest one?

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:24.590
I think it was Mass Effect.

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:27.350
TODD KERPELMAN: It was Mass
Effect where there was a

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:31.460
mobile game that I believe as
you played it, it gave you

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.160
bonuses in the actual
retail game.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.510
COLT MCANLIS: Yeah, so did you
guys get a chance to try that?

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:38.061
What were your thoughts
on that?

00:18:38.061 --> 00:18:40.765
WOLFF DOBSON: It's been
interesting for me with all of

00:18:40.765 --> 00:18:42.970
that stuff from the DLC and
the rest of the things for

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:43.320
Mass Effect.

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:47.125
Because Mass Effect is such a
coherent story from one end to

00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:50.070
the other when I'm exploring
these side stories.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.305
COLT MCANLIS: Except
the ending.

00:18:52.305 --> 00:18:53.200
TODD KERPELMAN: Wait.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:53.730
COLT MCANLIS: Separate
discussion, sorry.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.347
TODD KERPELMAN: I haven't played
it yet, don't talk

00:18:55.347 --> 00:18:55.840
about the ending.

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.540
COLT MCANLIS: Sorry.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.836
TODD KERPELMAN: It's
still on my list.

00:18:57.836 --> 00:19:00.810
WOLFF DOBSON: We all have
opinions about how it ended.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:05.930
But as a whole, there's this
coherent thing that happens

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:07.340
running together and
when you go off and

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:08.500
explore these side stories.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.060
Sometimes it deepens your
understanding of what happens.

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:14.430
They had the DLC where you go
and explore your own crashed

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:15.970
ship from the previous game.

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:19.140
Yeah, that's really cool, I'm
seeing the results of this

00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:21.202
other thing that was very
important to me in the

00:19:21.202 --> 00:19:22.300
previous thing.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.430
At other times it seems sort
of like well, this would be

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:28.990
things that you might cut from
when you were editing this in

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:30.000
the first place.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.270
But they say oh, we had more
stuff so we added on to it.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:37.650
And I think it's a little bit
like the problem you have when

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:40.550
there are comic books based on
really popular TV shows.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:44.820
And you think to yourself, I
want to read more about your

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:48.250
favorite TV show, Buffy
or whatever it is.

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:51.030
Except that they can't really
change anything in the

00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:54.440
universe in the comic world
because not everybody is going

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.850
to be buying the DLC, which
is the comic part.

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:01.060
So it ends up feeling kind of
starved because you say well,

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.370
you know, something will
happen, it might be

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:02.850
interesting.

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:04.570
But it's not going to be that
interesting as compared to

00:20:04.570 --> 00:20:05.780
what's going to happen
on the thing.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.930
And Buffy interestingly broke
out of that by ending the TV

00:20:08.930 --> 00:20:11.350
series and letting the comic
books begin changing the

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:12.860
continuity as they
went forward.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.320
And suddenly the comic books
got 100 times better.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.780
COLT MCANLIS: And I'm really
looking forward to the comic

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:19.630
book series of Cougar Town.

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:20.550
Really looking forward
to that.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:21.646
I think that's going
to be big.

00:20:21.646 --> 00:20:24.300
Mark my words.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.710
TODD KERPELMAN: [INAUDIBLE] a
lot, but it's a good show.

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:26.740
COLT MCANLIS: It
is a good show.

00:20:26.740 --> 00:20:27.340
TODD KERPELMAN: It's
a fantastic show.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:28.070
COLT MCANLIS: It's going to
be a great comic book.

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:32.170
TODD KERPELMAN: Terrible
title, but it's, yeah.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:35.050
WOLFF DOBSON: But I think
the DLC kind of thing

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:35.850
is in there, too.

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.450
Where if you're exploring things
that aren't important

00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:40.800
to the main story but are
important unto themselves, the

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.710
DLC works really well.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:44.940
And if you're a big fan, you're
just like let me get

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:46.990
out my credit card because I
need more of this action.

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:48.900
COLT MCANLIS: And where's
the limit though?

00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.290
Because DLC is this concept--

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:53.260
again, it's what John said
about tiers, right?

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.450
You've got Microtransaction
which has different variations

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:59.240
of durable achievement, versus
here's a plasma weapon that I

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.800
gained, versus some
other thing.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.550
WOLFF DOBSON: Like here's extra
bullets for this one.

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:04.400
COLT MCANLIS: Right, and then
you've got the next level up

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.400
which is DLC.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.930
Which really has only been born
in the past couple years

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:11.240
with console.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:16.310
I remember 2007-2008, DLC was
just really coming out.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.600
Before that there were called
Expansion Packs, and then it

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:21.120
became DLC, and now that's
even getting cut down.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.190
So where's the line
with AAA games?

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:27.600
Again, so we've got Borderlands
which I think did

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.210
Microtransaction DLC stuff
very well, we've got Mass

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:31.330
Effect in there.

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:32.600
Do we feel that this
has a proper

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.390
place in the AAA industry?

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:36.950
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Absolutely.

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:40.740
I think to your point, it either
has to be completely

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:44.830
satisfying on its own, or in
some way actually affect the

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:46.810
game world to make it
really entertaining.

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:48.720
But definitely.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.800
I mean, I'm really looking
forward to the Dark Souls

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.800
expansion pack coming
out this fall.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:00.232
That's a AAA game, and I am
ridiculously excited for it.

00:22:00.232 --> 00:22:04.250
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah,
I know some hardcore

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:05.600
gamers don't like DLC.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.430
They look at it like oh, the
companies are just holding

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:11.470
back content or leeching
off of us.

00:22:11.470 --> 00:22:13.100
WOLFF DOBSON: It's on
the disk already.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:14.350
TODD KERPELMAN: Yeah.

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:19.880
I can see their issue, but it's
like I think the thing

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:23.910
about DLC is one, it provides a
very real incentive for the

00:22:23.910 --> 00:22:26.470
developers to make sure
their game is good.

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:29.580
If it's just a title that they
sell you, and then all they've

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:33.160
got to do is get over that
hump of providing enough

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:33.590
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:34.050
video.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:37.910
Or a nice package that you say,
OK, I'll buy this, and

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:39.690
then you find out the
game's not any good.

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.030
They've still gotten
their $50-$60.

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:44.840
But with DLC now, they have an
incentive for you to play

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.050
through the entire game and say
wow, that was great and I

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:48.900
would like more of this.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.860
So I think it helps in that I
think it provides an incentive

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.330
for developers to make sure that
you enjoy their games.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:23:00.760
I think from an economics model
it allows you to pay as

00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:05.690
little or as much as you want
within limits for the game

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:06.360
experience.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.970
And in some ways I could see
a future where even the AAA

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:14.170
titles, the base
value is lower.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:19.540
Maybe not zero, but getting
down to $40 or $30 even as

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:22.470
they try and provide a wider
range of I'm sort of a casual

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:26.240
gamer, but I'd like to play some
hardcore console games.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.850
They can get in there with a
cheaper version and then as

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:32.750
you're more and more of a
fan, they can provide

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:33.660
more and more to you.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.060
COLT MCANLIS: Aren't we talking
about episodic content

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:35.440
at that point?

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.606
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah, I'm
starting to wonder if that's

00:23:36.606 --> 00:23:38.760
what you're going towards
is like a very

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.590
limited initial release.

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:42.710
Kind of like back with Doom
where you would get the first

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:44.540
10 stages in Shareware.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:46.960
WOLFF DOBSON: Or TryWoW where
you get 20 levels.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:50.240
All of this, I think if I recall
correctly, the economic

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.280
term for this is differential
pricing.

00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:57.280
Which is knowing you are the
person who wants the premium

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:58.020
experience.

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:01.790
You are the person who wants
the smaller experience.

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:03.750
You're the person who we're just
barely going to be able

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.740
to convince to buy this
in the first place.

00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:09.050
I mean, you need to provide a
wide variety of options so

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:09.880
that you can figure it out.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.620
Whether it's luxury cars
versus economy cars.

00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.645
They both get you someplace, but
they obviously have these

00:24:14.645 --> 00:24:18.020
very different reward path
sorts of things.

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:22.070
And the same thing is true with
collector's editions.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:24.850
Collector's editions
are $15 more.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.050
And, I mean, you
get cool stuff.

00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:28.490
And I totally have collector's
editions, because they

00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:31.390
differentially priced
me very correctly.

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:33.730
I said yes, I would like that,
thank you very much.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.070
COLT MCANLIS: The Halo 3 helmet
was probably the best

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:37.800
one, but it wasn't life-sized
enough.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:39.525
They gave you this little
Halo 3 helmet.

00:24:39.525 --> 00:24:40.750
TODD KERPELMAN: You
couldn't wear it?

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:41.230
COLT MCANLIS: No, you
couldn't wear it.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.410
My child could wear it.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:43.440
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Could
a cat wear it?

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.170
COLT MCANLIS: Could
a cat wear it?

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:47.090
You know what, I think we
should Google that.

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.080
WOLFF DOBSON: Dead Space gave
you the plasma cutter.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:49.660
COLT MCANLIS: Oh, really?

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.375
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes, I have
the little plastic

00:24:51.375 --> 00:24:52.100
clip, plasma cutter.

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.090
TODD KERPELMAN: That's nice.

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:56.130
WOLFF DOBSON: Actually, it's
like maybe half-sized, which

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:58.580
means actually my daughter is
perfect and she ran around the

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:00.200
house plasma cutting
things for a while.

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.080
COLT MCANLIS: Especially cats.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.097
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So the house
just burnt down.

00:25:03.097 --> 00:25:05.320
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, she
just kept slicing

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.410
holes in the house.

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:07.370
Eh, you know.

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:09.760
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: I think it was
someone from Nintendo that

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.260
said a few years ago that the
vast majority of gamers never

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.440
reach the end of a game.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.920
WOLFF DOBSON: Oh, that study's
been done lots of times.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.740
Sierra did it as well,
it's like less than

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:18.780
12% of their users.

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:23.090
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So maybe most
consumers would like to be

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:26.990
able to buy the first 30%
of a game and play that.

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:29.580
And then once they've reached
that limit, they're like OK,

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.460
now I'm completely dedicated
to this, I'm

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:32.800
going to keep going.

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:33.920
And then you DLC.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.100
WOLFF DOBSON: Well, at that
point you need the

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.290
frictionless purchase
experience.

00:25:36.290 --> 00:25:39.150
Where it's like yeah, this is
awesome, let's keep going

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:41.580
right now and don't let me stop
and get out my wallet.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.260
COLT MCANLIS: And then
have to download 7

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:44.306
gigs worth of content.

00:25:44.306 --> 00:25:46.870
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: So you
definitely have to streamload.

00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:48.670
WOLFF DOBSON: And speaking of
streaming, I just remembered

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:51.670
the other thing, which is if
you ever play a game like a

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:53.490
Jak and Daxter Naughty
Dog game.

00:25:53.490 --> 00:25:56.655
Try running the opposite
direction down the corridor.

00:25:56.655 --> 00:25:58.810
Like if you play Uncharted and
you start running the other

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:05.030
way, it starts like god, because
you weren't supposed

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:05.460
to run that direction.

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:06.730
Don't run backwards.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:08.350
TODD KERPELMAN: They
need to trip you.

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:11.078
JOHN MCCUTCHAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:26:11.078 --> 00:26:14.460
TODD KERPELMAN: So we actually
have a question on [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:16.440
that is related to web games.

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.110
COLT MCANLIS: Someone's
watching.

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:17.780
TODD KERPELMAN: On
our moderator.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:19.440
Yeah.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.560
Thank you everyone
for watching.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:23.570
So let's see here.

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:27.170
The question is, HTML5 games
use JavaScript game engines

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.040
and this code can be
viewed by players.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.820
Is there any way that we can
make sure that the game code

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:34.780
is not edited while saving
high scores?

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.220
COLT MCANLIS: So I think there's
some assumptions about

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.590
this question that I think are
worth addressing before we

00:26:40.590 --> 00:26:41.460
actually answer it.

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:46.530
So the direct question is the
code is not edited while

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:47.470
saving high scores.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:51.130
So some assumptions there is
that the code itself is

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.690
editable in a form that
could save it.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:55.420
Like whether or not the high
score is saved locally versus

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.530
pushed to cloud store, things
along those lines.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:00.720
I assume that if you do have
some high score that you do

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.050
have some login mechanisms.

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:05.390
So there is an authentication
token involved with the

00:27:05.390 --> 00:27:07.010
process there, too.

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:09.130
Just to lay the groundwork to
make sure that we're all

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:12.290
talking about the same
thing with that one.

00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:15.200
I didn't have an answer.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.140
WOLFF DOBSON: There's lots of
ways to get around that.

00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:21.550
This problem exists even outside
of HTML5, and Flash

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:22.770
has this problem in spades.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:23.930
TODD KERPELMAN: Or Compiled C.

00:27:23.930 --> 00:27:27.610
WOLFF DOBSON: Yeah, I mean, I've
never opened up an object

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:30.180
file and begun changing
things.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:31.160
COLT MCANLIS: What's
an object file?

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:33.270
WOLFF DOBSON: Yes, exactly.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:39.040
But one of things you can do if
you develop online games is

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.330
make sure that the actions that
players do, the ones that

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:45.420
matter, actually have a round
trip to the server.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:49.740
That's the basic thing to do,
which also stops race

00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:50.360
conditions.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.480
You need some place that's
transactional, that players

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:55.704
don't have an entire free access
to the entire way.

00:27:58.610 --> 00:28:04.190
Another way to go about that is
authentication systems and

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:05.840
token systems.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.150
We deal with that in Hangouts
all the time.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:09.510
Where it's like how do I know
that I'm actually acting on

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:12.270
behalf of me, and not-- and then
there's a long discussion

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:13.520
of OAuth and if I had that--
