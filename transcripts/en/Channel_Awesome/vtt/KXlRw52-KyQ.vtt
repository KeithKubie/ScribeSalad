Rob Schneider: Hey, thanks buddy but you forgot to put me in Pixels.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.560
Adam Sandler: Well that's because you wouldn't do Blackface for me.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.100
Rob Schneider: Seriously Sandler, even I have standards.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.600
Adam Sandler: No you don't.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.440
Rob Schneider: You're right.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.860
Past Sandler Character: No Adam, Don't you see?

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.240
Even your idiot characters from the past have figured it out.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.660
Your audience has grown up but you yourself have not grown up.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.680
Adam Sandler: What are you talking about dude? I've got a lot older.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.320
Past Sandler character: No Adam! Your audience have discovered new things so you must discover new things.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.380
Evolve your craft. Try something different.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.580
Use your movies as more than just an excuse to go on vacation.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.020
I mean look at your latest publicity photo, even you're sick of you.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.360
Try again Adam Sandler. Try!

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.720
Adam Sandler: I see what you're saying.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.640
I should be even more predictable...

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.340
Past Sandler character: Well erm, no...

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.180
Adam Sandler: More unfunny...

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.580
Past Sandler character: I definitely didn't say that.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.960
Adam Sandler: And even more racially insensitive.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.380
Past Sandler Character: Oh Christ, I'm just going to sit down.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.440
Adam Sandler: Hey Rob Schneider, can you do Redface?

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.280
Rob Schneider: [Enthusiastically] Can I?

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.580
Nostalgia Critic: Hello I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.680
Well ever since I did my clip-less review of "Jurassic World"

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.800
a lot of people have been requesting me to do another recent movie

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.440
and surprisingly it wasn't "50 Shades of Grey."

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.320
Tamara: Thank God!

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.660
Nostalgia Critic: Hey, come on, ball gags are surprisingly comfortable.

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:16.780
Tamara: How would you know?

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.360
Nostalgia Critic: Research.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.680
No, that movie is the Adam Sandler non-hit, "Pixels".

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.860
Left and right people have been asking me to review this and at first, I didn't really get why.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.680
Okay there is nostalgic value seeing how it ties into video games of the eighties

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.940
and I have ripped apart several Adam Sandler productions of the past

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.280
but I think the real reason is, it's one of the worst reviewed films of the year.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.260
The internet has gone insane with how much they hate this movie.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.240
It's this year's "Fantastic Four".

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.860
I mean...before this year's "Fantastic Four".

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.800
Yeah it looked bad but...seventeen percent bad?

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.560
That's lower than "Waterboy", "That's My Boy", and "Little Nicky".

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.040
Jesus, it's worse than those!?

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.980
That's like having Hitler and then finding out that there's a mega Hitler.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.180
A Hitler that did even worse than Hitler and wasn't funny.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.580
So without further ado, let's take a look at...
O.C: Futurama.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.480
Animated Elephant: Futurama, Futurama, Futurama, Futurama, Futurama, Futurama...

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.620
Nostalgia Critic: Yes, let's first address what everybody is already talking about

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.000
How similar this concept is to an episode of "Futurama".

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.720
Despite the movie being based on a short film, there's an episode of "Futurama" where video games from the 80's

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.060
attack their city that's pretty damn close in comparison to this.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.240
But I'm choosing to judge this on its own merits because much like "Osmosis Jones" and "Inside Out",

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.260
Even if it has been done it before, what matters is what they can bring to it that's new and good.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:47.020
And Adam Sandler Movies are so the exact opposite of this that there is actually an app for it now.

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.000
Animated Elephant: There is?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.960
Nostalgia Critic: Oh yeah, it's called the "Appler Sandler".

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.820
His films are actually so easy to make now that you can literally phone them in.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.460
Err, let's see, Normal voice Sandler or Annoying voice Sandler?

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.980
Animated Elephant: I'd rather rub my balls on a cheese grater than listen to his annoying voice.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:01.740
Nostalgia Critic: Normal voice it is.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.880
Err, let's see, bland, hot girlfriend or really bland, hot girlfriend?

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.780
Animated Elephant: What's the difference?

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:07.800
Nostalgia Critic: One gets a crying scene.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.700
Animated Elephant: Hmm, I guess that one.

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:09.380
Nostalgia Critic: You got it.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.420
Animated Elephant: Wait, what are those?

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.480
Nostalgia Critic: Oh, those are add-ons that come no matter what.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:17.320
Kevin James, Suckered in Celebrities, Pitty cameos from SNL Alumni.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.900
The only thing left to choose is funny or unfunny?

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.700
Animated Elephant: Oh my God I never knew we had a choice. Choose funny man.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.560
Nostalgia Critic: Alright.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.600
Hey, what the....

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.720
...come on.
Animated Elephant: Come on.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:30.160
Nostalgia Critic: Jesus Christ, why would you put so much time, effort and money into something

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.700
if you're clearly not going to make it funny, you painfully obvious metaphor.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.260
Animated Elephant: [Annoyed sigh]

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.180
Nostalgia Critic: It starts off with the younger versions of Adam Sandler and Kevin James in an arcade competition,

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.600
Where we insert Sandler App number 162, "Sweet Old Lady", who delivers our first big zinger.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.000
Tamara: "Look it's Grandma."

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.280
Malcolm:  "Yoohoo."

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.260
[Pause button sound effect]

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.360
Nostalgia Critic: That's the first joke people, she says "Yoohoo" while holding up a bottle of "Yoohoo".

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.660
A $110 Million Dollar budget and that is their opening joke.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:09.420
You know, why don't you just be honest and say...

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:10.980
Tamara: Look, it's Grandma...

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.640
Malcolm: F*ck you bitches, I'm smoking your money.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.740
Nostalgia Critic: Sandler loses to a kid named Eddie

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.620
which means that Eddie's gameplay will be put in a time capsule and launched into space

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.900
This brings us to present day when Sandler App number 229,

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.560
"Down on his luck has-been who people think will amount to nothing"

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:35.120
is having a conversation with Sandler App 465, "Supportive best friend and binge drinking idiot Kevin James",

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:37.260
who is President of the United States.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.180

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.160
[Phone Explodes]

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:44.720
Yep, even the app couldn't handle something that dumb. Kevin James is President of the United States.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.460
Exploded phone: Bullshit.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:50.660
Nostalgia Critic: In a country that is actually kind of considering electing Donald Trump as our next president,

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.360
Even we can't be f*cking stupid enough to accept this as a reality.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:00.180
And the weird thing is, he still plays it as the idiot best friend like he always does.

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.140
He doesn't act like a president at all.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:07.380
Which is why, just to give you an idea about how lazy this is, I'm going to switch out Kevin James with Obama.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.300
Now tell me if this makes any sense whatsoever,

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:11.520

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.260
Sandler: Er, Burnie, please. I'm a totally different character now.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:18.500
Obama:  Yeah sure, so Adam, I'd like to get drunk while helping my loser friend in a bar

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:24.260
but I, err, need to overcome this outburst I had whilst screaming at school children because I can't read.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:26.640

00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.660
Obama: That's really in our movie.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.500
Sandler: Shouldn't you be doing presidential stuff, that kind of thing?

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.940
Obama: Oh I do, like when our country is under attack I make a cake with my wife.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.400
Sandler: That can't be in our movie.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:36.980

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:37.860

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.940
Sandler: If you're still in the Theatre folks  I, err,  salute ya.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.540
Nostalgia Critic: Sandler then goes to a customer's house to fix their TV but finds the owner, played by Michelle Monaghan,

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.240
is crying in the closet while sipping champagne out of a sippy cup.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.680

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.020

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:03.180

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:11.600
The couple that act like they're not going to get together but everyone else in the world knows they're going to get together.

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:31.660

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:42.640
Now Adam,  our military was attacked in a way that was, err, very similar to a video game.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:46.440
As you know, no-one in our American Intelligence has ever played a video game.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.440
Sandler: Yeah, nerds and games often don't mix.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.960
Obama: You are the only person who can figure out these patterns that people online have figured out years ago.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.460

"Unrealistic over-compensatingingly pathetic best friend."

And I know that it's the actor who played the snowman from "Frozen" and not the actual snowman from "Frozen"

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.960
but I'm choosing him because the only funny thing they have in common is that you want to see them both impaled.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.720
Olaf: Now lets teach them that sitting on your lazy ass, playing video games can somehow make you a hero.

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.920

[Inane gibberish]

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.980
Nostalgia Critic: So the aliens misinterpret the time capsule and think it's an act of war.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.700
Therefore, Sandler and Unfunny Pervert instruct the soldiers about how to defeat them.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.420
But of course when they finally attack, nobody listens.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.460
Sandler: No, no, you're supposed to shoot all the way to the left.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:36.120
Automated voice: Do not listen to him even though we are supposed to.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.360
We are military and not trained to follow orders.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.660
Nostalgia Critic: But Sandler grabs a gun and starts shooting them up like an action hero.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:47.020
Because playing this at home is clearly the same thing as fighting in the field.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:52.600
And he kills them all off, proving that Adam Sandler is in fact better than the military.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:57.880
Okay, why in this universe, does being good at Pac-Man suddenly translate into being good at driving?

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:12.360
and Sandler's men, the people that just been watching on a screen were advising?

Wouldn't that just add up more?

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.540
Nostalgia Critic: But the reason that doesn't work Sandler is because you act like you're taking it so seriously.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.240
but they make it clear that when they touch something it turns into pixels

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.780
but when a crane stops Frogger, nothing happens.

Oh yeah, and despite her not talking at all, she also falls in love with the unfunny pervert.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:40.920
to summon our heroes for one last challenge. Again, really no reason at all to give them a chance to win.

00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:45.420
But once again they have to play by the games rules so what do our heroes do?

00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:47.740
They cheat and don't play by the games rules.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.560
Yeah, remember that scene earlier saying how cheating was bad?

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.600
Well that is exactly what they do, except it ends up winning the day.

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:56.560
The only reason it's okay here is because it makes Adam Sandler look good.

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:07.480
Nostalgia Critic: This means all the pixels disappear including unfunny perv's love but it's okay because Q*bert turns into her.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:14.300
This is so blatantly lazy that even Sandler himself shrugs off how little this makes sense but doesn't give a shit.

00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:18.260
Sandler: Nobody questions why Q*bert suddenly turned into a hot lady?

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:24.680
Oh well, who cares? We just wasted millions of dollars and doomed video game movies forever. Whoa!

Announcer Voice: And to preserve our comedic masterpiece, we're taking down every video on Vimeo that has the word "Pixels" in the title.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:47.660
Yes, we really did that. We're kind of f*cking insane.

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:49.120
Oh, and while we're at it.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:54.680
We know what you want, we're so not behind the times.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.800
And that was "Pixels", one of the most hated films of the year.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:05.900
Is it one of the worst, if not, the worst Adam Sandler production that has ever been put together?

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:07.520
No.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.160
It's not even close really.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:16.300
There are so many other films that he has had a hand in that tried less and accomplished less than this has.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:22.340
There was one or two neat effects and every twenty minutes maybe I had a little bit of a laugh

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.860
which is more than I can say for some of his other productions.

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:31.180
So, why is there so much hate? Why does this one get people just so f*cking pissed off?

00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:36.260
Because it's 20 f*cking 15.

00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:43.900
The fact that Sandler is still using these lazy gimmicks with no changes is just becoming insulting.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:49.600
Even if you don't like his humour which is totally understandable, you felt like he was at least trying.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:54.440
You felt like, even though it was weird there was some form of effort being put into his work before.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.040
Here it's like a $110 million dollar auto-pilot.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:02.780
We know Sandler, as well as all the people here can be both talented and funny.

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:06.400
But as so many comedians are trying to evolve and adapt with the time

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.280
Sandler seems bizarrely disinterested in getting better.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:15.940
I think we're angry because we want to like "Pixels". We want to like Sandler's work

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.280
and when we find, it's not only bad but feels uncaring-ly bad,

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:25.700
we wonder why no-one is waking up after all of these bombs and saying, lets try something different.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.300
Let's step up our game, step up our jokes, step up our characters.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:33.400
This is the tipping point where people are just saying, "Enough is Enough."

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:38.040
"Give us effort again, give us energy, give us something that feels fresh and new."

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:41.120
"Similar to the first surreal time that we've ever encountered you."

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:45.160
Until then, we still have the Sandler App

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.980
