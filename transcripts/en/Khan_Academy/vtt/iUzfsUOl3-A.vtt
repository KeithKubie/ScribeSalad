00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.420
Welcome back.

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.610
On the last video we came to
the conclusion that we could

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.020
figure out the volume when we
rotate a function about the

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.400
x-axis, so let's apply that
to an actual exercise.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.500
I'm going to erase everything
because I don't want you to

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.660
memorize this, because frankly
I haven't memorized this.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.170
And if you do, you'll forget
it one day and then you

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.990
won't know how to do it.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.990
But if you understand why it
works then you'll never forget.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.550
As long as you remember
basic integration.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.490
Maybe you want to memorize it
if your teacher tends to give

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.830
you a test that don't have
much extra time in them, just

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:39.900
to speed up the process.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.720
But you should know
what's going on.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.090
So let me draw the axes again.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.340
That's my y-axis.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.420
That's my x-axis.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.708
And so since our first example
was y equals square root of

00:00:49.708 --> 00:00:51.235
x, let's stick with that.

00:00:51.235 --> 00:00:54.970
And for reasons that might
become apparent that tends to

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.230
be one of the more typical
examples when you rotate

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.980
things around axes.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.040
So let me see if I can draw it
as well as I drew it last time.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.230
Almost.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.920
OK, so that's y equals square
root of x, it's just f of x

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.500
this time, I've defined it.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.110
This is the x-axis.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.980
That's the y-axis.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.000
And I'm going to rotate this
around the x-axis again.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.500
So I'm going to get a
sideways looking cup thing.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.780
And let's say I want to figure
out the volume of that cup

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.680
between the points 0-- and to
make it simple, let's just

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.370
say the points 0 and 1.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.670
So essentially we're just going
to get a cup, a sideways

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.375
cup, it's going to look
something like this.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.280
It's going to look
something like this.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.590
That's going to be the--
that's a horrible-- the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.950
opening of the cup.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.490
Actually why don't I
use the circle tool.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.650
It just dawned on me that
I had a circle tool.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.255
So the opening of the cup
will look like that.

00:01:55.975 --> 00:01:58.210
Actually I could
draw it right here.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.020
This would be the
opening of the cup.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.820
Well-- you can see sometimes
that my videos are

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.980
a little unplanned.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.650
There you go.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.230
So that would be the
opening of the cup.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.320
This is excellent.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.550
This tool is very well suited
for what I'm doing here.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.390
We're rotating around that way.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.280
We're turning that function.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.980
So the cup's going to look like
that, so the bottom part of the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.390
cup's going to look like this.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.310
And it's solid, so we want the
volume of the whole thing.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.310
In future videos I'm going to
show you actually how to figure

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.770
out the surface area of the
cup, which I find in some

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.950
ways more interesting.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.250
So how do we think
about that again?

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.220
Let's just rederive it,
but this time we'll use

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.610
a specific equation.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.710
So we just have to figure out
what is the volume of one disk

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.420
and then sum up all the disks.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.970
So let's say this disk right
here-- actually let's just take

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.090
this disk at the end point
right here that I've already

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.850
drawn something for.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.500
So what's the radius
of this disk?

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.330
The radius of that disk
is f of x at that point.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.830
Well f of x at that point
is just square root of x.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.740
Radius is equal to
square root of x.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:17.870
And so the area of that disk is
going to equal pi r squared.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.830
Well the radius is square root
of x, so it equals pi times

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:22.540
square root of x squared.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.440
So it equals pi times x.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.830
That's the area of each disk.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.860
And then if we want the volume,
you just have to multiply the

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.550
area of that surface times
the depth of the disk.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.870
I'm just trying to show.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.530
You can imagine that this is
kind of like a quarter and this

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.600
is the side of the quarter.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.730
We saw in the last video that
depth, that's just a very

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.710
small change in x, because
we want each disk to be

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.540
infinitesimally thin.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.720
So the width is just
dx at any point.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.550
So the volume of each disk is
equal to the area, which we

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:10.305
just figured out was pi x
times the depth, times dx.

00:04:10.305 --> 00:04:12.190
That's the volume of each disk.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.620
So the total volume is
going to be equal to the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.840
sum of all of these.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.470
That was one disk I drew, then
you're going to have another

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.980
one here, you're going to have
another one here,

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:23.610
another one here.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.100
You're going to have infinitely
many, and you want them to be

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.250
super, super, super thin so
that you get an accurate

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.120
measure of the exact
volume of this curve.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.890
Otherwise it would just be an
approximation, and that's

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.330
where we use the integral.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.900
So it will be the
integral from.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:41.170
And my original
boundaries were 0 to 1.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.600
The disk we used as an example,
this is probably you know the

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.290
last disk, so this one will
actually have a radius of the

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.250
square root of 1, which is 1.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.840
Not that you have to know that,
I'm just trying to keep

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.730
emphasizing the visualization.

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.240
So what will be the integral?

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.500
Well we're going to go from 0
to 1, and we're going to sum up

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.820
a bunch of these disks, which
we've already defined,

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.530
so it's pi x dx.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.010
This is looking to be a fairly
straightforward integral.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.300
So what's the integral of that?

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.670
Pi is just a constant and the
antiderivative of x is x to

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.525
the 1/2 over-- I'm sorry.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.795
It's x squared over 2.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.840
I've been a little rusty
since I last did some

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.410
antiderivatives.

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:45.330
So we get x squared, we get
pi times x squared over 2.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.460
That's the
antiderivative of that.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.536
And then we have to evaluate
it at 1 and then subtract

00:05:53.536 --> 00:05:56.010
it and evaluate it at 0.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.860
And so what do we have.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:07.960
We get 1/2 pi, so we get pi
over 2 minus 0 pi, minus 0.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.950
So it equals pi over 2.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:12.510
There we go.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:17.610
We just figured out the volume
of this cup from 0 to 1.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.730
Reasonably interesting.

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:23.210
Let's see if we can do that
again to figure out the-- just

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:28.880
to give you another example,
just hit the point home-- to

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.460
see if we can figure out the
volume of a sphere,

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:33.340
the equation for the
volume of a sphere.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.480
So what's the equation
for a circle?

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:43.770
It's x squared plus y squared
is equal to r squared.

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:46.540
And let's write that in terms
of y is a function of x, just

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.530
so we have something that
we can work with the

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:49.260
way we learned it.

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:59.300
So we get y squared is equal to
r squared minus x squared, and

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:09.600
then we get y is equal to the
square root of r squared

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.380
minus x squared.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.920
Actually now that I realize it,
I'm going to not do this,

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.910
because I think I'm going into
too complicated a problem.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.910
I did that on a fly.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.040
But in the next video I will
do slightly more complicated

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.640
without going to this one,
because I probably don't have

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.100
time for it I just realized.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:29.350
Anyway I'll see you
in the next video.
