00:00:00.208 --> 00:00:02.875
In the beginning, when we did
all this experimental stuff

00:00:03.041 --> 00:00:07.833
we did these little booklets,
telling people what we felt,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.833
what art was for us.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.375
–We did in fact two booklets.
–Yes, do we still have that?

00:00:13.541 --> 00:00:14.791
“A Day in the Life of
Gilbert and George,”

00:00:14.958 --> 00:00:16.416
and “To Be With Art
Is All We Ask.”

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:19.833
I think “Oh Art What Are You?”

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.375
was the most important
early one.

00:00:23.083 --> 00:00:24.750
Because that was the tryptic.

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:27.708
And we showed it
at Nigel Greenwood’s gallery.

00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:28.708
And to our amazement,

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:32.625
it was bought by the most
important museum in the world.

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.500
The Museum of Modern Art
in New York.

00:00:35.083 --> 00:00:37.625
We felt extraordinarily proud
I remember.

00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:46.208
That is still one of the texts
that reads true today,

00:00:46.375 --> 00:00:48.416
the search in the world

00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:50.583
for whatever truth
we were looking for,

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:54.291
political, or ethnic or the news
and the killing or whatever.

00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:56.500
That’s a text on that in a way.

00:00:56.666 --> 00:00:59.750
–And I think it is that one.
–What is the culture?

00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:01.416
We like it very much

00:01:01.583 --> 00:01:05.125
because it feels like
art is a human person.

00:01:06.708 --> 00:01:09.375
Like a blond person

00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:11.916
walking along
Charring Cross Road.

00:01:12.083 --> 00:01:15.000
And he is art,
and we’re trying to approach him.

00:01:15.291 --> 00:01:19.833
So that is trying to approach art,
trying to, what do you call,

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:22.166
–touch it.
–Trying to find the truth.

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.000
Find the truth, and it's fantastic.

00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:27.083
You talk about how art
is taunting you,

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.541
that art is this thing,
this third person.

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:32.875
And it is sort of reaching out
and grabbing you,

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:35.125
and you want to possess it

00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:37.541
but you don’t know
actually how to acquire it.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.625
I think we did feel very,
lost and lonely at that time.

00:01:41.916 --> 00:01:43.208
More than now.

00:01:45.833 --> 00:01:48.666
We were extremely innocent
and naïve in many, many ways

00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:49.791
at that time.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.416
But it’s worked
quite interestingly

00:01:52.583 --> 00:01:54.458
because in some ways,
we were trained.

00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:58.416
Many, many years I saw George
I was trained for six years

00:01:59.208 --> 00:02:02.000
for sculptures
and all kinds of stuff.

00:02:02.375 --> 00:02:03.375
–Highly trained...
–And even George,

00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:05.666
but we realized that’s not it.

00:02:06.208 --> 00:02:08.708
Art has to be a vision,

00:02:08.875 --> 00:02:11.708
a personal vision
of how you see the world,

00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:16.916
how does it feel being alive,
and scratching it on the wall,

00:02:17.083 --> 00:02:19.500
like what do you call it?

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.625
Cave paintings, no?

00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:24.333
Everyone always did.

00:02:26.791 --> 00:02:28.083
Your text is not sloppy.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.166
It’s very well considered
and thought out.

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:31.541
Can you talk a little bit about

00:02:31.708 --> 00:02:34.291
how you came to the process
of writing the text?

00:02:35.083 --> 00:02:36.041
All of our writings were done

00:02:36.208 --> 00:02:38.166
at the Wimpy Bar
at Liverpool Street.

00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:41.500
Because we had no heating,
so in the evenings

00:02:41.916 --> 00:02:45.500
we always had a very drawn-out
dinner at the Wimpy Bar.

00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.125
It was nice and warm in there.
We did the writing there.

00:02:48.291 --> 00:02:51.916
Yes, it’s very interesting because
we became the loners.

00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:54.583
And we still are.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.833
We are not going into
neighbors houses, no,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.375
we are alone in the world.

00:03:00.541 --> 00:03:03.791
And that was those days already
that we felt alone.

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:09.250
We were walking alone
thinking this person that is art.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.791
We still feel
we’re underneath the arches

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:19.208
in that poetic, dreamy way.
That’s still our life.
