00:00:00.992 --> 00:00:05.456
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.357 --> 00:00:09.190
KAT ARNEY: All of that,
and I'm still amazed

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.720
I can find my shoes
in the morning.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.570
I thought I would start
with a very brief reading

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.170
from my book, which
sets the scene

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.830
and explains why I set
out on this journey

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.370
and why the book is called
"Herding Hemingway's Cats."

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.330
So this is from
the introduction.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.720
You don't have to read along.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.780
It's fine.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.259
So it starts, "it all started
with a photo of a cat.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.570
I was hiding at the back
of a scientific conference

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.270
at the Royal Society
in London when

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.140
a cuddly looking cat
with unusually big feet

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.770
caught my eye.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.260
'This is a Hemingway
cat,' said the lecturer,

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
pointing at the animal on
the large screen behind him.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.390
They have six toes.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.040
They're polydactyl.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.150
Ernest Hemingway was
said to be fond of them,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.520
and they still live on his
estate in Florida today.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.700
And here, he poked
at the computer,

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.450
changing the slide
to one covered

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.340
with photos of misshapen human
hands, of polydactyl children

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.900
with extra digits.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.200
It's the same genetic
mistake that causes them.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.366
So looking at a six-toed
cat or a six-fingered human,

00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.990
a natural assumption
might be that it's

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.190
due to a fault in a gene.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.660
But it's not.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.820
In fact, the cause lies
in a faulty region of DNA

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.030
that acts as a control
switch, normally

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.070
turning a gene on at the
right time in the right place

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.920
to direct the formation
of fingers or toes

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.560
as a baby or kitten
grows in the womb.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.780
Not only that, but
the switch is miles

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.940
away in genetic terms from
the gene it acts upon.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.740
Learning about the Hemingway
cats and their broken switches,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.630
it got me thinking about my own
understanding of how genes work

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.670
and how I explain
it to the public

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.960
through my work as a
broadcaster and writer."

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.180
And so I wanted to write a
book about how genes work.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.679
And so I traveled and Skyped
my way around the world,

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.470
talking to loads of
scientists that I know.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.590
My background's in genetics.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.980
And I said, I'm writing a
book about how genes work.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.234
What can you tell me?

00:02:06.234 --> 00:02:08.650
And pretty much all of them
said, well, when you find out,

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.226
let me know.

00:02:10.226 --> 00:02:11.420
[LAUGH]

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.960
Which really set the
tone for the idea

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.580
that there's so much we think
we know about genetics and genes

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.730
and how our genes build
our bodies and make us, us.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.790
But in fact, we
barely know anything.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.460
And it is like
herding cats, just

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.460
trying to drag all these
ideas together and understand

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.470
what to make of them.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.040
So I thought I would present to
you a little basic introduction

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.219
to genetics.

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:38.760
Has anyone got any
kind of background

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.070
in genetics, genes,
DNA of any sort?

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.120
OK, you can skip the first half.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.110
And then I talk a bit
about some of the stories

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.380
that I uncovered in the book.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.130
And there's all kinds
of tales in here.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.040
It's all first
person interviews.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.480
There's a few jokes,
all sorts of things.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.170
So obviously I recommend
that you read it,

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.620
but I thought I'd talk
about a few of the stories

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.010
that I uncovered along the way.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.356
So here we go.
(SINGING) Da da da da!

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.732
Pity my whimsy.

00:03:11.732 --> 00:03:13.150
There we go.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.670
So obviously, you
all work at Google.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.332
What is the internet made of?

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:20.160
AUDIENCE: Cats.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.826
KAT ARNEY: Cats.

00:03:20.826 --> 00:03:22.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.910
Science is also made of cats.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.680
But obviously with science cat
jokes, you can overdo them.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.680
It also turns out that DNA
is made of cats as well.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.320
So this is DNA.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.620
You've probably all seen it.

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.340
It's the sort of
standard shorthand

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.660
for all science-y,
biology stuff.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.560
But this is the stuff
of life, the instruction

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.050
manual in all our cells.

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.020
All of life has DNA.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.297
It's made up of four different
letters, A, C, T, and G.

00:03:57.297 --> 00:03:59.130
These are four chemicals
all strung together

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.910
in all kinds of
different orders.

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.920
And it's the cell's
instruction manual.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.550
It tells the cell to do things.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.870
This is a very basic cell.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.280
Well, it's an egg.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.960
But the best way to
think about cells

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.710
is that they're like
kind of fried eggs.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:13.690
Right?

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.290
Stick with me.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.930
Stick with me.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.050
The bit in the middle
is the nucleus.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:23.420
This is where the DNA-- not made
of cats-- the DNA made of DNA

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.350
is in the nucleus, and the
rest is called the cytoplasm.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.970
And all your body
is made up of cells.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.040
You are made of trillions
and trillions of cells.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.200
You have skin cells,
you have brain cells,

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.610
you have fat cells,
you have toenail cells.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.570
We're all made of
different cells.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.070
But they all have
the same DNA in them.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.210
And it's the
instructions in that DNA

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.506
that make your cells do what
they do and build your body.

00:04:45.506 --> 00:04:46.880
So this is the
key thing to know.

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.430
When people start
talking about genes

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.510
and we hear about genes in the
newspapers and stuff like that,

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.650
people want to talk about
a gene for alcoholism.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.460
Oh, there's a gene
for Alzheimer's.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.620
It's the gene for
cystic fibrosis.

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.010
It's the gene for obesity.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.990
No.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.490
Genes are things that
make things in cells.

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.150
They're basically
cookery recipes.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.320
So when you're trying to talk
about how our genes work,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.900
it's always important
to remember,

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.960
genes are instructions
that make things.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.220
And then it's how those
things in our cells,

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.520
in our bodies, in our brains
are all put together and work

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.450
that make us who we are, give
us the abilities and skills

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.000
that we have, and also
the diseases that we get.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.750
So I'm going to do a really
tiny bit of molecular biology.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.890
And I'm going to
apologize, because I'm

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.690
really bad at PowerPoint.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.570
So please laugh appropriately.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.310
So I'm going to explain to you
how genes work, and then we

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.430
can all go home.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.510
Genes work like this.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.350
You have DNA.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:47.880
That's some DNA.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.110
That's a gene.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.030
So a gene is basically
an instruction

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:53.380
that is just a segment of DNA.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.550
It's kind of a
recipe within a book.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.670
All the DNA in your cells is
like a recipe book or a recipe

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.780
library, and a gene
is just one recipe.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.800
This is the thing
that reads the recipe.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.060
It's called RNA polymerase.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.400
Reads the recipe.
(SINGING) Da da da da da!

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.270
It took me so long to
work out how to do that.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.200
I'm really bad at PowerPoint.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.670
I may even move on to, like,
a star fade at some point.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:23.720
And it makes a
molecule called RNA.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.130
So RNA polymerase makes RNA.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.000
And that is the
message from the gene

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.680
that then a cell uses
to build something.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.570
This is the chef that's
making stuff in the cells

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:40.200
from the copied
instructions in the recipe.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.520
It's called a ribosome.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:49.460
Reads it, makes something,
and it makes protein.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:54.520
And proteins are the things
in your cells that do stuff.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.070
So your skin is kind
of hard and solid

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:58.930
and keeps the outside
out and the inside

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:01.700
in because it's full of
a protein called keratin.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.300
The cells in the
back of your eyeballs

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.040
can see because they have
proteins that can sense light

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.410
and can send those
messages to your brain.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.540
All of our bodies are
made up of proteins.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.670
Kind of all the
molecules as well.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:17.840
But genes are the instructions
that tell your cells

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:18.990
to make proteins.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:20.310
They're recipes.

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.480
So again, just to reiterate.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.160
Genes are not things that
give you diseases or give you

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.050
traits.

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.280
They make stuff.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.110
So a little-- a few
facts, because I

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.260
know you all like facts here.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.040
Factual things.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.290
So I'll have to keep
it nice and factual.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.870
My favorite fact
about biology, you

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:43.430
have 2.2 meters of DNA in
every single cell in your body.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:45.130
This is absolutely staggering.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.160
I'm five feet tall.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.630
Two meters is enormous.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:51.430
It's very thin, but it's
two-- I mean, come on.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.030
Who's slightly boggled by that?

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.260
Every single cell
in your body-- you

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.970
have enough DNA in your
body to go to the moon

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.460
and back 1,500 times.

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.590
I find this staggering.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:05.770
More people-- I mean,
I'm a biologist.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.130
I find this stuff cool.

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.270
Within that, you have three
billion letters of data,

00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:16.500
effectively, of the A's, C's,
T's, and G's, the instructions.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:18.580
It's a huge amount of data.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.390
And within that are
the instructions,

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:23.890
the genes, that tell
your cells what to do.

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.236
So how many have we got?

00:08:26.236 --> 00:08:27.860
Well, it was originally
thought that we

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.651
had something upwards of
100,000 genes to make a human.

00:08:31.651 --> 00:08:34.150
God, we're probably going to
need a lot of genes, aren't we?

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:36.010
Because we're kind of cool.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.214
Turns out we've got
about 20,000 genes.

00:08:38.214 --> 00:08:42.450
We're clocking in somewhere
around fruit flies and nematode

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.517
worms.

00:08:44.517 --> 00:08:46.100
So this was a bit
of a shock when they

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:47.250
sequenced the human genome.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.001
They were like, wha?

00:08:49.001 --> 00:08:50.000
Where are all the genes?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.740
They did a bet.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.430
They actually did a
sweepstake to make people

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.400
bet on how many genes
there were going to be.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.425
And people started out,
like, 150,000, 100,000.

00:08:59.425 --> 00:09:02.430
We were like, whew.

00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:05.520
We basically don't really
have that many genes.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.434
We use the ones we have in
very interesting ways, which

00:09:08.434 --> 00:09:10.100
sort of proves it's
not what you've got,

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.930
it's what you do
with it that counts.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.670
But we only have
20,000 genes or so.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.690
And all of that makes you, you.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:23.540
And in fact, the sum total
of your-- all your genome,

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.090
those phone books
full of information

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:32.270
that is actual genes is
really not very much.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.170
I told you I really
wasn't very good at this.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:41.930
Only about 2% of your genome
is actual, honest to God genes.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:43.000
So this is the question.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.456
Like, what's the rest?

00:09:45.456 --> 00:09:45.955
Any guesses?

00:09:48.597 --> 00:09:49.180
AUDIENCE: Cats

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:49.650
KAT ARNEY: Cats.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:50.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.780
Not cats.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:55.460
Good-- good callback, though.

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:58.930
The rest-- I mean, people say,
oh, the rest is just junk DNA.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:09:59.650
It's just junk.

00:09:59.650 --> 00:10:01.410
It's just there.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.180
Is it just junk?

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:05.920
No, it's not.

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:08.180
So there are all kinds
of things in your genome

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:12.670
in between the genes that
are-- some of it is junk, true.

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:15.680
But there are things like
all the control switches that

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.430
turn your genes on and
off in the right time

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:24.485
and in the right place to make
you, you, and to make you work.

00:10:24.485 --> 00:10:26.610
There are genes as-- well,
I said at the beginning,

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:29.674
there are genes that encode the
instructions to make proteins.

00:10:29.674 --> 00:10:32.090
But there's also lots and lots
of genes that are just read

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.240
into that message, that RNA.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.500
And that does stuff
in cells as well.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.890
There's a lot we really
don't understand about that,

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.480
but it's a very
interesting area.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.120
A huge chunk of your
genome-- and I'm

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:48.570
sorry to say this-- is
just dull and repetitive.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.440
Same as like the actual work
of sequencing the human genome

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.820
is very dull and repetitive.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.590
Most of your genome
is made up of things

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.160
called transposons or
repetitive elements.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.310
These are long-dead
viruses or jumping

00:10:59.310 --> 00:11:02.360
genes that somehow
got into our genomes,

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.620
got copied and copied and
copied and copied and copied.

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:11.340
Your genome is basically, a
lot of the time, full of crap.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.870
And some of it is
actively harmful.

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:15.850
Some of it is garbage.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.230
We have some things
in our genome

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.160
that are really not good for
us, and evolution is gradually

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.980
clearing them out away.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.970
But a lot of the other
stuff, the junk that's

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.980
in our genome, people say, well,
why have we got it in there,

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.500
you know?

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.040
Everything must be
here for a purpose.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.020
Well, these people perhaps have
a slightly religious agenda.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:37.690
And they cannot comprehend the
idea that we can just have crap

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:40.549
in our genomes
that's just there.

00:11:40.549 --> 00:11:41.840
I'm going to do a quick survey.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.980
Hands up if you have
some stuff in your house

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.288
that is just there.

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:47.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:51.280
Because the effort of
getting rid of it--

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.834
if I had the world's most
neat, clean, tidy office,

00:11:54.834 --> 00:11:55.750
that would be amazing.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.340
But the effort of
actually tidying my office

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.020
is unbelievably hard.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.290
It's much better just to,
like, put it all in a box

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:03.870
and just leave it there.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.020
It's not hurting anyone.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:06.040
It's not in the way.

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.600
If it starts to get in the
way or if it starts smelling

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:12.022
or I really need that box
for something else, sure,

00:12:12.022 --> 00:12:12.730
I'll [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.300
But it's the same
with your genome.

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.580
Evolution is not this
perfect winnowing

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.610
engine that gets rid of
everything all the time

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:20.842
it doesn't need.

00:12:20.842 --> 00:12:22.550
And I'm kind of sorry
to break it to you,

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:26.616
but you are not the
pinnacle of our species.

00:12:26.616 --> 00:12:28.240
I mean, even though
you work at Google.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.320
Sorry, guys.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.660
You are not the bestest, most
fittest example of humanity--

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:35.955
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:37.100
--that could possibly be.

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:40.640
Evolution is a constant process.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:41.670
So it's not perfect.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:45.650
And we keep stuff in our genomes
that, you know, is just there.

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.150
It's not doing us any harm.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.540
It's just there.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:52.170
So I'm going to focus on
some things in our genomes,

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:53.124
the control switches.

00:12:53.124 --> 00:12:55.040
Because there are some
quite nice stories here

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.799
that I cover in a couple
of chapters of the book.

00:12:57.799 --> 00:12:59.840
Now the control switches
I'm going to talk about,

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.510
these are the things that
turn our genes on and off

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:05.010
in the right time and
in the right place

00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:06.730
to make the tissues of our body.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:07.780
And this is important.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:12.990
Because as I said, all the cells
in your body have the same DNA.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.510
They all have the same
instruction manual.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.340
But the cells of your
body are different.

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.490
You have 200 more than-- way
more than 200 different types

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:22.390
of cells.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.950
You know, hair cells, skin
cells, fat cells, liver cells,

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:27.930
kidney cells, all
these kind of things.

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:30.890
But you have the same
instruction manual.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:32.740
So it obviously
figures that you have

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:37.290
to use your genes in different
ways, different types of cells,

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:38.400
to get the right outcome.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.774
It's the same
thing as, you know,

00:13:39.774 --> 00:13:41.970
if you're making a
glamorous dinner party,

00:13:41.970 --> 00:13:44.390
you'll want glamorous
dinner party recipes.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:46.200
Whereas if you
make a kid's party,

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:49.062
you want kind of a
kid's party recipes.

00:13:49.062 --> 00:13:50.020
So this is the problem.

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:52.270
All our cells are not the same.

00:13:52.270 --> 00:13:55.570
And this goes back right to the
very, very beginning of life.

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.660
You start life as
one single cell,

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.690
a fertilized egg when mommy
and daddy love each other very

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:02.630
much.

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:03.650
And you grow.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.170
You grow into two cells,
four cells, eight cells,

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:07.524
a little football of cells.

00:14:07.524 --> 00:14:08.940
You become a sort
of little bubble

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.310
of cells with a blob
in the middle of it

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:13.340
that is going to be you.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:17.070
And those cells are the
stem cells that make a baby,

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.050
and they have to specialize,
they have to make decisions.

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:22.340
They have to go, are you
going to be head or tail?

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:24.140
Are you going to
be brain or skin?

00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:26.045
Are you going to be
inside or outside?

00:14:26.045 --> 00:14:28.440
Are you going to
be gut or liver?

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:30.836
All the way down to the
really finessed decisions.

00:14:30.836 --> 00:14:32.835
Are you going to be that
bit of your fingernail,

00:14:32.835 --> 00:14:35.440
or that bit of your fingernail?

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.940
And all of this is
determined by genes

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:42.450
turning on and off at the right
time and in the right place.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.980
So how does that work?

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.160
Well, you can think
of this is a bit

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:50.100
like a kind of a genetic
switch, a control switch.

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:52.870
So here's our
representation of a gene,

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.510
the blue thing with the arrow.

00:14:54.510 --> 00:14:56.200
People always draw
genes like this.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.050
It's a gene.

00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:58.270
It gets read that way.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:00.030
That's why we draw
them like that.

00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:04.570
The little purple thing near the
beginning of the arrow, that's

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.480
something called a promoter.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.740
Now all genes have a
promoter at the start.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.500
This is the thing that
says, here's the gene.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.380
We start reading it
here in that direction.

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:19.980
Now just having a promoter is
not enough to turn a gene on.

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:24.490
You need a molecule, a
protein, a transcription factor

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.381
to come and sit on
that and say, OK.

00:15:27.381 --> 00:15:27.880
We're here.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.130
This is the start of the gene.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:31.310
We're going to do
something here.

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:34.599
But that's still not
enough to turn a gene on.

00:15:34.599 --> 00:15:36.140
So what you have is
a control switch.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.660
That's the little
green thing there.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:41.220
And you have other
molecules, depending

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.650
on the type of cell that it
is, that sit on those and say,

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:45.150
right.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:49.010
We're going to turn this
gene on here in our cells.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.660
And in other sorts
of cells, they'll

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:52.960
have a different suite of
these factors that turn genes

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:56.140
on in different places.

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.950
And ta-da!

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:03.020
That is enough to
get a gene going.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.530
Now obviously that's
just one thing.

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.350
So that's only going to turn
that gene on in the place where

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:10.180
the green thing is happening.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.480
Does this all make sense?

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:12.080
Yeah?

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.380
Good.

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:15.310
So of course, if you
want to turn genes on

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:18.540
in, say, different tissues,
if you need the same gene

00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:23.610
to be switched on in the brain,
in the liver, in the kidneys,

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.690
in the lungs, but
not anywhere else,

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:29.770
you need a little
bank of switches

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.580
that all respond to
different factors that

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:36.200
are there in that tissue
at the right time.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:39.840
So that's a really--
that's about kind of a year

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.510
and a half's worth of a genetics
and molecular biology course

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:43.010
there, guys.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.020
So well done.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.720
And now we get to the fun stuff.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.840
This is Ernest Hemingway.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.507
I love Ernest Hemingway
for many, many reasons,

00:16:52.507 --> 00:16:54.840
mainly because God, that guy
could write a sentence that

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.390
punched you in the face.

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.350
But Ernest Hemingway also
liked several things.

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.830
So things liked by
Ernest Hemingway,

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:04.444
I have done a Venn diagram.

00:17:04.444 --> 00:17:06.569
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:09.649
Ernest Hemingway likes fighting.

00:17:09.649 --> 00:17:11.690
We know from books like
"Death in the Afternoon,"

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:13.310
he likes fighting.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:16.795
He also liked fishing, mating--

00:17:16.795 --> 00:17:17.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:20.077
--and all these
things come together--

00:17:20.077 --> 00:17:22.369
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:24.180
--in cats.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.599
I knew I'd get back
there in the end.

00:17:26.599 --> 00:17:28.670
And specifically, these cats.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.075
Now this is a
polydactyl cat, like I

00:17:31.075 --> 00:17:32.200
mentioned at the beginning.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.510
It has multiple toes.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:36.030
You can see it's the
thumb there, bizarre,

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:38.510
three-claw thing.

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.620
So this is a polydactyl cat.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.250
And Ernest Hemingway
had loads of these cats

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:45.810
on his estate down in Florida,
down in the Florida Keys.

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:50.065
And the story goes that he was
given one cat called Snowball

00:17:50.065 --> 00:17:52.650
or possibly Snowflake--
the legend is

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:56.490
a bit uncertain-- by
an old ship captain.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.420
Gave him a six-toed cat.

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:00.300
And Hemingway kind of
liked them because he

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:03.710
likes the sea and sea
captains, so he kept it.

00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:06.950
And the story's about
why so many of the ships

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:09.610
had six-toed cats,
because they're

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.260
very popular all down the
eastern seaboard of the US.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.724
Loads and loads of the
cats have six toes.

00:18:15.724 --> 00:18:17.140
There's an idea
that maybe they're

00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.230
better at catching mice.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.780
You know, you've got kind
of big, extra paws, toes.

00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:23.970
You can get them.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:24.903
Important on a ship.

00:18:24.903 --> 00:18:25.402
Useful.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:30.540
If the ship's kind of
rocking about a lot and you

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.020
have a prehensile
thumb, you could

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.452
grab onto a rope or
something like that.

00:18:35.452 --> 00:18:36.785
You just imagine this cat like--

00:18:36.785 --> 00:18:38.240
[MEOW]

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:42.670
--hanging onto the rigging,
that kind of thing.

00:18:42.670 --> 00:18:45.440
There are many reasons
why cats with six toes

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.670
may be useful on board ships.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.180
The main reason, I think,
is probably this one.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:55.340
Because, like, what's more
lucky than a cat with five toes,

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:57.510
right?

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.320
So let's look in a
little bit of depth

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.520
at the switches
that are responsible

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.180
for this particular phenomenon.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:11.150
So this, this is the bit
of proper genetics here.

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.290
This is the part of
the cat genome and also

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:18.390
the human genome that is
responsible for building toes.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:20.250
I mean, not specifically
building toes.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.550
There isn't a toe
gene as discussed.

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.550
But there is a molecule, and
it's called sonic hedgehog.

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:29.210
Yes, after the
cartoon character.

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:31.630
That's that sort
of little SHH thing

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:34.020
where the green
arrow's pointing.

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:36.760
And that is responsible
for basically saying,

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:40.140
let's build some digits here.

00:19:40.140 --> 00:19:42.260
Let's do something here.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.479
Now sonic hedgehog is
used all over the body

00:19:44.479 --> 00:19:45.270
during development.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:46.990
It's used to build digits.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.200
It's used to make
decisions in the brain.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.610
It's kind of a
deciding molecule.

00:19:50.610 --> 00:19:53.220
It decides things for cells.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.110
So it gets turned
on in the brain.

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.040
Those are the blue
things called CNS.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.220
Those are the Central
Nervous System switches.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.850
It's involved in the
skin and the guts,

00:20:01.850 --> 00:20:02.865
the epithelial linings.

00:20:02.865 --> 00:20:05.260
Those are kind of
the orange switches.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.210
But the one I'm really
interested in is the green one.

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:11.250
And that is the limb
bud switch which

00:20:11.250 --> 00:20:13.840
turns on sonic hedgehog-- that's
the little blue patch there.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:17.970
This is like the developing
pore of a mouse in the womb.

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:20.430
It turns on sonic hedgehog in
a little strand at the bottom

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.310
where the fleshy part of
your hand's going to be.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.470
And it says, we're going
to make some fingers.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.680
And these ones are going
to be, like, pinky,

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:30.620
fourth finger, third finger, all
the way through to the thumb.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:32.120
It's sort of a
gradient that says,

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:35.010
we're going to do
fingers like this.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.860
So it's a really
important switch.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:41.830
And obviously when
it's faulty, you

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:44.430
end up with the
cells in the hand,

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:47.260
in the developing hand, just
kind of not knowing what to do.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:50.650
They just start making more
and more toes or thumbs,

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:53.140
because they're just not
really sure what's going on.

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.730
And it's the same
mutation in cats

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.330
and a similar mutation
in polydactyl humans

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.300
with multiple fingers as well.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:03.040
So these switches are
kind of really important.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.610
And obviously, there's
an evolutionary advantage

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:07.780
to cats having six toes.

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.540
Because as I said,
on ships they're

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.160
perhaps better at grabbing on or
just that sailors favored them.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:14.780
And who knows?

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:18.910
Maybe one day these cats with
thumbs may gain other skills

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:23.280
and possibly learn to
kill us as we sleep.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.583
And I, for one, welcome
our feline overlords.

00:21:25.583 --> 00:21:26.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:31.110
But there's an interesting
and more important thing here.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:36.790
So these switches in the genome
are evolution's playground.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:39.710
So we think about evolution
as very small changes.

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:42.420
You know, we're taught
at school that evolution

00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.100
is very, very slow.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.970
One change, and you
get a small thing.

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:49.650
Maybe a tail gets a bit bigger
or a neck gets a bit bigger,

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.330
or you get a bit more
spotty, or something.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:56.270
Evolution is very
slow and gradual.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.660
But as we've seen,
just one faulty switch

00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.410
is the difference between
having five toes and six toes.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.920
So small changes
in these switches

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.300
can make really big
changes to organisms.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:11.340
And I'm going to tell you
about one of these stories now.

00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:13.400
So I'd like you
to meet some fish.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.330
We go from cats to fish.

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:18.320
And these are sticklebacks.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.339
Anyone seen sticklebacks,
gone fishing for sticklebacks?

00:22:22.339 --> 00:22:22.880
They're fish.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.770
They're spiny.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:28.050
So the top ones are
sticklebacks that

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:29.280
live in marine environments.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.890
They live in the sea.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:32.800
Now about 10,000
years ago, there

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.540
were lots of sticklebacks
like that living in the sea.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:37.730
And they would always
swim up the rivers

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:41.890
to spawn and do whatever
it is sticklebacks do.

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:44.490
I mean, probably carefully
if you've got those spines.

00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:45.990
I'll tell you.

00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:49.230
So they swim up the streams to
go into fresh water to spawn,

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:51.860
and then they come
back down to the sea.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.840
Now a bunch of
sticklebacks came really

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:59.070
unstuck in the last ice age
in that they got upstream,

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:00.930
and then they got stuck.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:03.790
So you separated two
populations of sticklebacks.

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.820
So you've got the ones on the
top that are marine dwellers.

00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:11.210
And over the course
of 10,000 years,

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:14.980
the sticklebacks in
the freshwater lakes

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.720
changed to be like
the ones below.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:24.890
Now can anyone see the
difference between those two?

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:26.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:28.810
KAT ARNEY: Slightly
bigger fins, yeah.

00:23:28.810 --> 00:23:31.830
The key thing to notice a thing
that looks a bit like a willy

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:34.250
on the top one kind
of poking down.

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:37.540
It's not a willy, because
I wouldn't show you that.

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.450
In fact-- well,
that's coming later.

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:40.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:44.630
But that is some pelvic spikes.

00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:48.180
So the sticklebacks that live in
the sea, they have these spiny

00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:50.092
fins to fight off predators.

00:23:50.092 --> 00:23:51.550
It's something like
kind of fembot,

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:53.700
like-- pu, pu, pu kind of thing.

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:57.900
They have these spiny
fins to keep them safe

00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:00.520
because there's loads
of predators in the sea.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.950
The sticklebacks that ended
up in the freshwater lakes

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:06.750
didn't have the same
predators, and they

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:09.520
don't have these spiny fins.

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.580
So a guy in Stanford
in the US called

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:13.330
David Kingsley got
very interested in this

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.860
and he said, well, what's the
difference between these two

00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:16.180
fish?

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.680
Because to all
intents and purposes,

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.520
they're only separated
by 10,000 years.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:22.590
That's not very long
in evolutionary terms.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:25.850
And they kind of
look pretty similar.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:27.940
So here's an X-ray
of these fish.

00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.440
So the top one is
marine sticklebacks,

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:33.969
and the bottom one is the
lake-dwelling freshwater

00:24:33.969 --> 00:24:34.510
sticklebacks.

00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:38.220
They've got no bloody pelvis.

00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:42.860
Their entire pelvis is missing.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.880
So not just they haven't got the
spiny fins or their spiny fins

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.240
are a bit smaller.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.730
The whole thing's just gone.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.980
That is pretty radical.

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:54.930
And for that to happen in just
10,000 years-- which is like,

00:24:54.930 --> 00:25:01.400
it's nothing in evolutionary
terms-- that is amazing.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:06.800
And actually, it's down to one
broken control switch in a gene

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:07.930
called Ptx1.

00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:10.440
Don't really need to know
what it does or what it's for.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.670
But one single
change in a control

00:25:13.670 --> 00:25:16.230
switch that turns a gene
on at the right time

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:20.570
to build the pelvis in the
sea sticklebacks, broken

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:22.660
in the freshwater sticklebacks.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:23.650
No pelvis.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:24.620
No pelvis at all.

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:25.120
Gone.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:25.619
Vanished.

00:25:25.619 --> 00:25:26.740
Gone.

00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.490
It's absolutely incredible.

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:31.920
And what's even more
amazing is that you

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:36.160
can take that bit, that
control switch in the DNA,

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:39.590
and you can put it back
into freshwater sticklebacks

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:43.020
with no pelvis, and
they will grow one.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:48.740
So you can see there that
little-- that shouldn't

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.180
have that bit there.

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.060
They've put that
control switch in there.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.800
It turns the gene back
on at the right time.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.360
And these fish, first fish of
their type for 10,000 years,

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.010
growing a pelvis and,
like, their spike things.

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:04.540
Who knows what they
thought of that?

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.280
Maybe they wake up like, whoa!

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.276
[LAUGH]

00:26:07.276 --> 00:26:07.776
Whoa?

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:15.960
And this is not
the only example.

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.060
So David Kingsley's
looked at other examples.

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:21.330
For example, we have
a gene called Kitlg.

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:24.330
This is responsible for things
like pigment, pigmentation

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:26.265
in the hair, in the skin.

00:26:26.265 --> 00:26:28.390
You get two different
versions of a control switch.

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:31.390
There's one letter
difference in this control

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:34.770
switch by the Kitlg gene.

00:26:34.770 --> 00:26:39.820
One of them gives
you brunette hair.

00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:41.370
The other gives you blonde hair.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:46.030
That's one single letter
is the difference.

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:48.350
Now I grew up in
the '80s and I would

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:49.960
make a lot of blonde jokes.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.570
And I-- I'm sorry.

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.310
I didn't know any better than.

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.180
But I know now.

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:57.766
But it's one letter
that's different.

00:26:57.766 --> 00:26:59.140
And you know,
blonde jokes aside,

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.790
there are more
fundamental things.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:04.150
Again, there's another
control switch.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:07.900
One single letter
difference is the difference

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:11.850
between white skin
and darker skin.

00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:13.140
Now it's not like an on/off.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.015
If you've got this,
you're going to be white.

00:27:15.015 --> 00:27:17.070
If you've got this,
you're going to be dark.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:19.980
Because you know, we are more
than fifty shades of people

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:20.900
here.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:23.150
But it's kind of
turning the dials.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.630
It's ramping genes up and
down, making them more active.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:28.920
You make more pigment
or less pigment.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:34.662
And it's one letter in the three
billion letters of your genome.

00:27:34.662 --> 00:27:37.120
Now as I was researching this
and kind of writing about all

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.335
of this, it was just
when all the race

00:27:40.335 --> 00:27:41.585
riots were going on in the US.

00:27:41.585 --> 00:27:46.130
You know, the police sort of
shooting unarmed black people.

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:49.820
And I sort of sat there and I
thought, this is ridiculous.

00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.970
It's one letter in
our DNA, and people

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:55.660
have died for
thousands and thousands

00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.170
of years because of this.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:59.150
So anyway, that's
the philosophy bit.

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:02.620
And now here comes the rude bit.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:08.300
So I don't know, ladies,
if you've noticed,

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.650
but if you've ever
had sex with a chimp--

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:12.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:13.710
--they don't call
you in the morning.

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:18.840
There are certain
species, mammal species,

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:22.910
things like chimps,
mice, tomcats, they have,

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:27.500
what's probably nicest to call
it, a promiscuous lifestyle.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.710
They sort of prefer
the wham, bam,

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:32.790
thank you, ma'am kind
of school of procreation

00:28:32.790 --> 00:28:34.720
rather than anything else.

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:39.541
They certainly don't spend
their Saturday mornings in Ikea.

00:28:39.541 --> 00:28:41.040
I'm just about to
get divorced, so I

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.782
don't have to spend my Saturday
mornings in Ikea anyway.

00:28:43.782 --> 00:28:46.350
Yay!

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:51.080
But what is different between
these species and human males

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.437
is that if you look in
the trouser department--

00:28:53.437 --> 00:28:55.020
I think this is going
on the internet,

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:58.430
so I probably need to be
a bit euphemistic here.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:02.940
But if you look on the
genital equipment of things

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:05.670
like the tomcat, the
mouse, and the chimp

00:29:05.670 --> 00:29:07.900
there from left to
right across the top,

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:12.510
they have these kind of
spikes on their penis.

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:14.610
That's the technical term there.

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:16.410
Is this going to be
explicit content?

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:17.110
It's fine.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:18.340
OK.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:21.480
So they have what's
called penile spines.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:24.130
And these are, for some
reason, meant to, like, grip

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:26.240
on if the lady's
running away going, you

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:29.130
never even bought me
dinner, that kind of thing.

00:29:29.130 --> 00:29:31.310
But they're meant to
grip on and enable

00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:35.050
the males to go for their sort
of fast and furious mating

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:37.130
style.

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:42.720
Guys, I'm assuming
that you guys don't.

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:45.610
If you do, you should
go and see a doctor.

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:48.960
And some human males do
have, like, little nodules,

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:51.300
and they're the
remnants of these.

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:53.740
But the key difference
here is that there

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.510
is a single genetic
switch that is

00:29:55.510 --> 00:30:00.150
different between all the
species with spiky penises

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:01.384
and human males.

00:30:01.384 --> 00:30:03.800
And it's a switch that controls
a gene called the androgen

00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.000
receptor, which is a receptor
for the male sex hormone

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.020
testosterone.

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.310
You know, it makes you grow
your male characteristics,

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:11.720
and things like that.

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.920
And this one change
in this switch

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:17.180
is responsible for
this difference.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:21.090
So you can tell a lot of
evolutionary just-so stories

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:23.000
about all these kinds of things.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:29.030
One is maybe that some lucky
proto human developed this

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:32.480
in his genitals and
the ladies that he was

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.450
going with were like, oh, yeah.

00:30:34.450 --> 00:30:35.260
[LAUGH]

00:30:35.260 --> 00:30:38.540
I think I prefer that
to the spiky one.

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:40.120
Do you want to do it again?

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.460
And maybe that
encouraged pair bonding

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.290
and the more sort of
monogamous social relationships

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:46.900
that humans have.

00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:47.470
I don't know.

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:48.980
Am I right, ladies?

00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:52.380
I personally don't really
fancy a spiky boner.

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:53.403
Don't know about you.

00:30:53.403 --> 00:30:54.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:55.210 --> 00:30:58.380
So those are some stories
about the control switches

00:30:58.380 --> 00:30:59.880
in our genomes and
how they can make

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:05.170
some really big differences
to the outcome of an organism.

00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:07.220
The other thing I want to
really briefly touch on

00:31:07.220 --> 00:31:11.670
before I finish is that I've
drawn a lot of pictures for you

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:14.724
of the idea of a gene as
this long, straight line.

00:31:14.724 --> 00:31:16.390
I've got a gene, we've
got the switches,

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:19.320
and things kind of sit on
it, and it does this stuff,

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:21.820
and it's all very linear.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.770
But as I said right
at the beginning,

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:29.280
you have two meters of DNA in
every single cell of your body.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.370
That's two meters
of DNA in something

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:34.570
that's less than the size
of the head of a pin.

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:37.330
So biology doesn't
look like these kind

00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:41.000
of nice, neat diagrams.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.500
The DNA in your
cells kind of looks

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:46.070
like this, but much, much
more messy and compact,

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:48.270
and it's wrapped up around
all sorts of proteins

00:31:48.270 --> 00:31:50.470
to keep it packed in there.

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:52.310
And you're like, wow.

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:55.690
How does anything find
anything in there?

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:02.600
And the idea is that our
biology is actually not

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.000
as neat and linear
as you might think.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.140
You can see a diagram like the
one on the top and think, OK.

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:12.210
These factors find these
genes and turn them on.

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:14.810
Stuff's got to find each
other in this complete mess.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:19.909
And sometimes it'll work,
and sometimes it won't.

00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:21.700
And genes will go on
and genes will go off,

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.712
and you have to bring
all this mess together.

00:32:23.712 --> 00:32:25.420
And I touch on it a
lot more in the book,

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:27.730
and I'd really encourage
you to find out a bit more.

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:31.500
But we are products
of probability.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.940
This is a stochastic event or
random, I prefer to term it.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:38.190
Scientists prefer stochastic,
because for some reason,

00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:42.850
just saying, like, life's
kind of random upsets people.

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:45.640
This is a stochastic process.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.710
Genes aren't exactly
switched on and off.

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:51.770
They're more like kind of
dials, suggestions, landing

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:55.590
platforms for the things
that make them work.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:58.160
And with that in
mind, I'll tell you

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.090
a final story before
I finish, which

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:02.412
is about the wobbly worms.

00:33:02.412 --> 00:33:04.870
So there's a chap called Ben
Lehner who works in Barcelona.

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:06.560
And he works with
these tiny organisms.

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.810
These are nematode
worms, C. elegans.

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:10.890
They're a millimeter long.

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:12.370
And loads of
biologists love them

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:16.590
because they are
completely stereotyped.

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:18.980
They do exactly the
same thing, same time.

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:20.690
They have an exact
number of cells.

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:22.840
It's about 1,000 cells.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:27.840
And they all divide in a
completely programmatic way.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:31.030
So you can start with one
fertilized nematode worm egg

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:36.090
cell, and you can watch on cue
as the cells pop into existence

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:38.410
and divide and specialize.

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:39.500
And they all have names.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.190
Every single cell in
that worm has a name.

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:44.260
They're called things
like AB1 and stuff

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:46.600
rather than, like, you
know, Carrie and Doris.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:50.010
But every single cell
in that worm has a name.

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:53.150
And the worms that he uses
are genetically identical.

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:54.660
They're like super clones.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.560
They're all exactly the same.

00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.940
And so you would assume that if
you damaged a gene or a control

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:05.540
switch or something like
that in one of these worms,

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:11.190
it would come out with exactly
the same outcome all the time.

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:14.480
And this is where it
gets weird, because you

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:19.870
have this gene, you
make a mistake in it,

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:23.100
half of the worms die.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:27.310
Now that's weird,
because they've all

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:32.760
got mistake in that gene, but
only half of them have died.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.900
So that tells you that there's
a whole bunch of buffering

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.730
going on in the genome.

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:40.790
And you know, like I say,
this is a stochastic event.

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:43.150
This is not a yes/no.

00:34:43.150 --> 00:34:46.880
And it highlights that our genes
are not yes/no, deterministic,

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.690
on/off, make this,
don't make that.

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:53.389
There's a lot of
randomness in there.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:56.929
Interestingly, if
you break two genes,

00:34:56.929 --> 00:34:58.130
you can shift the balance.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:35:00.740
You'll end up with
10 alive and 90 dead

00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.300
if you look at
100 worms that all

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.322
carry this gene [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:04.322 --> 00:35:05.780
And you know, if
you start breaking

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:09.620
more parts of the system,
you'll end up with all dead.

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.870
Biology is incredibly robust.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:15.440
We wouldn't be
alive if it wasn't.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.940
And the final thought
I will leave you with

00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.590
is this, is that the more we
start delving into our genomes,

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:23.110
the more we
sequence, the more we

00:35:23.110 --> 00:35:24.810
understand-- we're
now at this point

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:27.320
where we kind of
sequence all the things.

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.520
We're starting to sequence
more and more human genomes.

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:33.400
And we're discovering
incredible stuff.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.880
We're discovering the fact
that each one of us is walking

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:40.600
around with about 30 genetic
faults that should probably

00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:44.266
kill us, but they don't.

00:35:44.266 --> 00:35:45.890
Because you've got
all this other stuff

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:49.500
that's going on and
buffering in your genome.

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.260
And that's what keeps us
alive, and that's amazing.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:53.910
Your genome is amazing.

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:57.382
I hope you enjoy it, and I
hope you also enjoy my book.

00:35:57.382 --> 00:36:01.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:03.335 --> 00:36:04.210
MALE SPEAKER: Lovely.

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:05.064
Thank you, Kat.

00:36:05.064 --> 00:36:06.480
We've got time for
a few questions

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:08.002
if anyone has questions.

00:36:08.002 --> 00:36:08.710
You think of one.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:10.230
I will kick off.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:12.300
With the humans, we have
about 20,000 genomes.

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:13.026
And you said we're quite--

00:36:13.026 --> 00:36:13.390
KAT ARNEY: Genes.

00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:13.910
MALE SPEAKER: Genes.

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:14.300
I'm sorry.

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.720
And we're quite inefficient
in terms of, like, the baggage

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:17.440
that we store and stuff.

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:17.870
KAT ARNEY: Yeah.

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:20.550
MALE SPEAKER: So does that mean
animals which don't-- which

00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:22.805
have a much faster,
shorter life span--

00:36:22.805 --> 00:36:24.930
fruit flies and so forth--
are they more efficient?

00:36:24.930 --> 00:36:25.971
KAT ARNEY: Yeah, broadly.

00:36:25.971 --> 00:36:29.120
So fruit flies have
smaller genomes.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.870
They sort of carry
less crap with them.

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:33.730
It is like the idea,
if you live in a family

00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:35.350
home for, like,
60 years, you will

00:36:35.350 --> 00:36:37.425
accumulate loads of rubbish.

00:36:37.425 --> 00:36:40.120
It's broadly that kind of law.

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:42.120
And one of the most
incredible genomes

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.350
is the puffer fish, fugu,
the Japanese delicacy.

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:48.300
And that's got pretty
much all the same genes

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.260
that we have, but an
eighth as much DNA.

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:52.822
So that's really interesting.

00:36:52.822 --> 00:36:54.030
And when people go, oh, yeah.

00:36:54.030 --> 00:36:55.082
We need junk DNA.

00:36:55.082 --> 00:36:56.415
We need it for all these things.

00:36:56.415 --> 00:36:59.010
I'm like, well, you
don't need it pretty much

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:01.110
to successfully
build a vertebrate.

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:02.920
So it's an argument
that's still running.

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:03.920
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:04.490
All right.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:06.712
Yes?

00:37:06.712 --> 00:37:08.170
And if you can
repeat the question.

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:08.720
KAT ARNEY: Oh, OK.

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:09.220
Sure.

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.100
AUDIENCE: How do you
even count the genes?

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.686
How do you know
what isn't a gene,

00:37:12.686 --> 00:37:15.382
[INAUDIBLE] to other genes?

00:37:15.382 --> 00:37:16.840
KAT ARNEY: That's
a great question.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:18.560
So how do we know
what a gene actually

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:19.916
looks like in the genome?

00:37:19.916 --> 00:37:22.290
So this is the job of something
called genome annotation.

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:24.873
And there's all these people at
the Sanger Centre in Cambridge

00:37:24.873 --> 00:37:27.180
and the EMBL and things
like this doing it.

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:29.040
So remember I said
that there's a promoter

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.350
at the start of a gene?

00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:32.790
That's a really
characteristic DNA sequence

00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:33.780
that you can spot it.

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.690
There's things like--
something called a TATA box.

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:40.490
And that's a run of T, A,
T, A. That kind of thing.

00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:43.199
So you can spot those.

00:37:43.199 --> 00:37:45.490
I don't want to go too much
into the molecular biology.

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:48.810
But you get little groups
of three DNA letters

00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:51.190
that make the individual
building blocks of a protein.

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:53.870
So if you get a long
uninterrupted string of things

00:37:53.870 --> 00:37:57.270
that you know are making
proteins, you kind of go, OK.

00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:58.846
That's probably a gene.

00:37:58.846 --> 00:38:00.720
There are some other
characteristics as well,

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.060
but it's-- and that this
is where it gets hard

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:08.170
because there's been this sort
of arbitrary cutoff for how big

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:09.427
a gene is.

00:38:09.427 --> 00:38:10.010
So you go, OK.

00:38:10.010 --> 00:38:11.384
It has to be over
a certain size.

00:38:11.384 --> 00:38:14.330
It has to make a protein that's
at least this big to be a gene.

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:15.420
And now we're
discovering that there's

00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:16.920
all these kind of
tiny little genes

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.610
that actually make proteins.

00:38:18.610 --> 00:38:22.700
They're called smORFs,
Small Open Reading Frames.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:25.520
And it's just because we didn't
just arbitrarily said, oh,

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.800
those can't be genes.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.580
So you know, it's
like a fishing net.

00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:30.730
You only catch
the size of things

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:32.460
that you think
you're fishing for.

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:36.050
And again, we're saying as
humans, these are genes.

00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:38.294
And in fact, there's
a lot probably

00:38:38.294 --> 00:38:40.460
that we don't know that's
doing stuff in the genome.

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:42.900
So it's an open--
an open question

00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.481
about what's actually useful
and doing stuff in the genome.

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:49.750
Hi.

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:52.269
AUDIENCE: So my
understanding is that when

00:38:52.269 --> 00:38:54.268
we're sequencing genomes,
we break everything up

00:38:54.268 --> 00:38:54.976
into little bits.

00:38:54.976 --> 00:38:56.804
And then we count
all the little bits

00:38:56.804 --> 00:38:58.575
and we go, oh, they
probably go together

00:38:58.575 --> 00:38:59.685
in this order as a rough.

00:38:59.685 --> 00:39:02.002
How likely is it that
something will come along

00:39:02.002 --> 00:39:03.960
and we found we've been
doing sequencing wrong?

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:07.092
Or how statistical are
measurements, I guess,

00:39:07.092 --> 00:39:07.758
is the question.

00:39:07.758 --> 00:39:09.800
KAT ARNEY: Oh, so this
is, how accurate is genome

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.924
sequencing if we're just
kind of ripping everything

00:39:11.924 --> 00:39:13.770
up and sticking it
back together again?

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:14.930
You're looking for overlap.

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:18.530
I mean, the next
generation sequencing-- so

00:39:18.530 --> 00:39:22.160
when I was first a scientist,
the way we sequenced genomes

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:26.820
was you'd start here and read a
bit, and then you'd start here

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:28.040
and you'd read a bit further.

00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.740
So it was really--
you kind of knew what

00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:30.864
you were patching together.

00:39:30.864 --> 00:39:34.750
You looked for really big
overlapping bits of DNA.

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:36.990
The new generation of
sequencing kind of does take--

00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:37.823
takes everything up.

00:39:37.823 --> 00:39:40.110
It's like taking a book,
ripping it all to pieces,

00:39:40.110 --> 00:39:43.370
reading it all at once, and
trying to assemble the words.

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:46.515
And again, you're looking for
multiple overlapping regions.

00:39:46.515 --> 00:39:50.270
And yeah, it does come down to
how good your algorithms are.

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:53.150
And this is where the problem
is that so much of the genome

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:54.650
is repetitive.

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:56.680
that has been ignored.

00:39:56.680 --> 00:40:00.460
And now people are starting to
talk about the platinum genome.

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:01.640
I had a lovely analogy.

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:04.280
[INAUDIBLE] [? Bernie ?], who's
one of the big sequencing guys.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:07.792
He said, you know, for ages
we've drawn this map of Europe

00:40:07.792 --> 00:40:08.750
that's like the genome.

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:10.420
And everyone's gone, oh, God.

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:14.280
I don't want to have to
do the fjords, you know?

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.720
[GROANING]

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:16.430
I'll just--

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:20.440
[MUMBLING] But now we're
having to do the fjords

00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.360
because there's probably
interesting stuff in there.

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.170
Or we need to know
what's in there so we

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:26.253
know it's not interesting.

00:40:33.364 --> 00:40:36.092
AUDIENCE: So given the fact that
we have relatively fewer genes,

00:40:36.092 --> 00:40:40.560
but the total size of the
genome is comparable to--

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:43.060
and probably in the
larger end, does that

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.960
mean that the average
size of our proteins

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:48.407
is typically bigger than
those of other animals?

00:40:48.407 --> 00:40:49.240
KAT ARNEY: Well, no.

00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:51.620
I mean, we've basically
got mammalian genes.

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:55.210
So you know, there's
a pretty standard set

00:40:55.210 --> 00:41:00.020
of genes and proteins that build
vertebrates, build mammals.

00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:03.310
And our genes are broadly
the same as those.

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:07.200
There's nothing in our genes
that's particular to that.

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.480
Then it is in the junk,
in the control stuff,

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.820
and all the other stuff
that is special to us.

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:18.040
And it's quite an interesting
thing to get your head around.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:20.880
Because obviously, we
basically share all our genes

00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:22.250
with the chimp.

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:26.620
We are pretty much 99.9% chimp.

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:28.670
So the difference
between us and a chimp

00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:30.950
must be that our
control switches,

00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:35.016
our human controlled switches
in our-- rest of our human DNA,

00:41:35.016 --> 00:41:36.890
whereas a chimp's got
chimp control switches.

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:39.310
So you have primate
genes plus humans

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:43.400
switches makes human, primate
genes plus chimp switches

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.720
makes chimp.

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:49.384
So the actual-- the suite of
genes is very, very similar,

00:41:49.384 --> 00:41:51.300
but it's all the other
stuff that's different.

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.745
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:41:56.745 --> 00:41:59.220
So there's been quite a
lot of, like, studying

00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:02.190
the genes of
[INAUDIBLE] and cloning

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:08.625
and [? oil ?] companies that
offer to read genes, DNAs.

00:42:08.625 --> 00:42:11.390
But I was wondering,
like, at this point,

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:14.140
how far is science will
actually being able to,

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:18.165
like, later on in the
genetic material as like--

00:42:18.165 --> 00:42:19.540
KAT ARNEY: OK, in
terms of, like,

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:22.947
editing and sort of
design-- is this the design

00:42:22.947 --> 00:42:24.280
of [INAUDIBLE] kind of question.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.370
How close are we to taking that
information, manipulating it.

00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:30.396
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like-- or even
like if you get to know your,

00:42:30.396 --> 00:42:32.860
like, genetic material,
is there anything you

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:34.110
can do about it at this point?

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:34.320
KAT ARNEY: Yeah.

00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.212
Sure.

00:42:35.212 --> 00:42:37.880
The answer broadly is no.

00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.139
I need to be careful,
because Google own 23 of me,

00:42:40.139 --> 00:42:40.638
don't they?

00:42:40.638 --> 00:42:42.502
[LAUGH]

00:42:42.502 --> 00:42:43.750
MALE SPEAKER: A tiny bit.

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:44.666
KAT ARNEY: A tiny bit.

00:42:44.666 --> 00:42:47.779
So there's lots and
lots of organizations

00:42:47.779 --> 00:42:50.320
that will sequence your genome
or at least look at bits of it

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:50.920
and say, OK.

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:54.830
You've got this, which is linked
to this tiny increase in risk

00:42:54.830 --> 00:42:57.079
of x, y, zed.

00:42:57.079 --> 00:42:59.120
There are a few diseases
that we know of-- things

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.649
like cystic fibrosis is
a great example-- that we

00:43:01.649 --> 00:43:02.815
call the Mendelian diseases.

00:43:02.815 --> 00:43:05.460
It's like it's one
gene, one fault in it

00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:07.660
gives you the disease.

00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:09.684
The faulty gene in
cystic fibrosis,

00:43:09.684 --> 00:43:11.350
it makes a protein
that kind of shuffles

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:13.933
salt in and out of your cells
so you don't make mucus properly

00:43:13.933 --> 00:43:15.850
and all this kind of thing.

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:19.170
Most diseases, things
like Alzheimer's, obesity,

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:21.429
characteristics like
intelligence, even

00:43:21.429 --> 00:43:23.220
things like hair color,
skin color, weight,

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:27.520
all sorts of things, many, many,
many genes-- and it's about

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.070
variation, things being
dialed up and down.

00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:31.700
And like I showed
you with it, you

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:33.699
know, stuff's just kind
of a bit random as well.

00:43:33.699 --> 00:43:36.930
There's a whole random
element in there.

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:39.190
And that's what's been
really shocking about doing

00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:42.720
the sequencing studies and
discovering that lots and lots

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.590
of people are carrying mutations
that should be manifesting

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:49.055
as a disease, but aren't.

00:43:49.055 --> 00:43:49.930
So this is a problem.

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:51.910
If you have your
genome sequenced,

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:55.367
we now don't-- we're
starting to go, well,

00:43:55.367 --> 00:43:57.700
we thought that if you had
this, you would be like that.

00:43:57.700 --> 00:43:59.450
But now it's like,
well, if you have this,

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:01.220
you might be like that.

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:04.900
Might depend on a thousand
other variations in your genome,

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.140
and we don't understand
all that interplay.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:09.590
So there's a huge-- I would
recommend you read my book--

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:10.926
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:10.926 --> 00:44:12.550
--because there's a
huge chunk in there

00:44:12.550 --> 00:44:15.350
about how people are
trying to unpick this

00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:18.090
and trying to understand
how we integrate

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:20.602
all the information in the
genome, not just one gene.

00:44:20.602 --> 00:44:22.810
And this is where it comes
on to the sort of designer

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:25.094
baby genetic
manipulation question.

00:44:25.094 --> 00:44:27.010
Because you know, there's
all these techniques

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:29.030
you might read about the
papers called CRISPR and things

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:31.050
like that where you
can cut up bits of DNA

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:34.202
and manipulate them
and chop stuff around.

00:44:34.202 --> 00:44:37.470
For some characteristics,
for maybe these one gene,

00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:39.070
one disease kind
of characteristics,

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:42.260
I think that could be
incredible technology.

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:46.000
Real life-changing technology
for families that are affected.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.700
Whether you're saying, OK,
can I do a bit of chopping up

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:51.430
and make a more
intelligent baby,

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:53.580
there's so much we don't
know about the genetics

00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:55.670
of intelligence,
and the huge chunk

00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:58.547
of environment,
lifestyle, upbringing

00:44:58.547 --> 00:44:59.630
that comes on top of that.

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:03.070
So I think engineering
more complex traits

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:05.620
is going to be incredibly
hard, and you're probably

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:07.550
better off just having
sex with a clever guy.

00:45:07.550 --> 00:45:09.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:09.230 --> 00:45:12.709
AUDIENCE: In terms of the
nature-nurture argument,

00:45:12.709 --> 00:45:14.917
my understanding of epigenetics,
which is very basic,

00:45:14.917 --> 00:45:20.240
is that you can pass
the grandparents' genes

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.620
through to the grandchildren.

00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.310
If the grandparents were obese,
that might get passed down.

00:45:24.310 --> 00:45:26.760
Is that something
that is-- where's

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:28.160
that at in terms of science?

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:31.000
KAT ARNEY: So in terms of
where the silence is with that,

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.890
it's a little bit shaky.

00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:36.040
So the idea of, this
is-- epigenetics

00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:41.150
is a very, very misused and
incredibly abused phrase.

00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:44.800
It's so abused, the poor
thing needs therapy.

00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:46.710
This is-- epigenetics
is basically

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:48.840
describing how your genes
are used differently

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.110
in all the cells of your body.

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:52.990
Like I said, you've got the
same DNA in all your cells.

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:54.830
You need to turn
genes on and off.

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:56.180
That's epigenetic.

00:45:56.180 --> 00:46:00.040
It's in addition to the
DNA, to the genetic code.

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:03.030
So that's fundamentally
what epigenetics is.

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:05.700
The kind of stuff that the
papers get very excited about

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:09.360
is the idea of
transgenerational epigenetics,

00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:13.980
that something that happens
in the DNA of a grandparent

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.720
could get passed on to
their egg or sperm cells,

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:19.500
and then into the
next generation.

00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:21.320
And this isn't
changes in the DNA.

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:22.970
This isn't mutations in the DNA.

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:25.050
This is the sort of
information about stuff

00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:26.930
that's happened
in a lifetime that

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:30.450
has affected how the genes
work that then get passed on

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:31.540
down the generations.

00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:37.610
And in humans, the evidence
for a lot of this is sketchy.

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:40.800
It probably does happen, but not
in the way that people think.

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.500
And there's been a couple
of really exciting papers

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:46.130
just in the past couple
of months suggesting

00:46:46.130 --> 00:46:48.380
that maybe tiny little
fragments of RNA

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:51.110
might be responsible for
transmitting this information.

00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:53.246
But it's a very, very new field.

00:46:53.246 --> 00:46:54.620
And actually, when
I went to talk

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:56.990
to all the researchers
I was talking to,

00:46:56.990 --> 00:47:00.020
I asked them, what's cool?

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:01.040
What's interesting?

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.460
And then I said last
of all, what's weird?

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.810
You know, what makes
you think evolution,

00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:07.580
go home, you're drunk?

00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:11.040
And so many of them said,
transgenerational epigenetics.

00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:14.020
It's like it's really
the frontier about how

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:17.390
your lifestyle, things
you do in your lifetime,

00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:19.790
can they get passed on
to the next generation

00:47:19.790 --> 00:47:22.920
and the one after that, and
potentially even further?

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.240
And there's a whole
chapter about it--

00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:26.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:27.280
--in the end of my book.

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:29.350
Read my book.

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:30.694
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:30.694 --> 00:47:33.148
AUDIENCE: So this
is [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:33.148 --> 00:47:37.410
How much information about
creating a human is in the DNA

00:47:37.410 --> 00:47:40.480
compared to-- in sort of
[? transient ?] in living

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.304
humans?

00:47:41.304 --> 00:47:45.589
Or if I had just human DNA,
would I need a human egg

00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:46.770
to make a human?

00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:48.803
Or if I had, like,
T-rex DNA, would I

00:47:48.803 --> 00:47:51.022
need a T-rex to make a T-rex?

00:47:51.022 --> 00:47:53.620
KAT ARNEY: That is a
really great question.

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:55.550
If you had human
DNA and you put it

00:47:55.550 --> 00:48:04.720
into, like, a primate egg or
any-- anything, into anything--

00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:09.180
the problem is that life is
a kind of a slippery concept.

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.860
So life is not
just the molecules.

00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:15.530
Life is not just DNA.

00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:19.520
All cells, all living things,
come from existing cells.

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:22.320
So you would definitely
need to take the DNA

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:26.317
and put it into something.

00:48:26.317 --> 00:48:28.400
I mean, this is what Craig
Venter is trying to do,

00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:31.680
and he's doing it with,
like, very simple bacteria.

00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:35.841
Synthesizing DNA, putting
it into a hollow cell.

00:48:35.841 --> 00:48:37.090
And everyone goes, oh, my God.

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:37.940
He's created life.

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:38.696
We're playing God.

00:48:38.696 --> 00:48:40.370
It's like, eh.

00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:42.640
He still took some DNA and
put it into, effectively,

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:44.470
a living cell.

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:48.680
In terms of whether the switches
and stuff would all work,

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:49.880
some of them probably would.

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:51.280
Some of them probably wouldn't.

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:53.170
You can take, say,
a human chromosome,

00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:55.400
and you can put it
into mouse cells,

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:57.120
and it will start working fine.

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:58.870
And there's a really
interesting model of,

00:48:58.870 --> 00:49:00.820
I think, Down
syndrome that's based

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.690
on putting a human
chromosome into mouse cells.

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:08.266
So yeah, some of it
would probably work.

00:49:08.266 --> 00:49:10.550
I don't know.

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:11.166
I've got time.

00:49:11.166 --> 00:49:11.980
I'll write a grant.

00:49:11.980 --> 00:49:12.979
I'll let you know.

00:49:12.979 --> 00:49:13.770
MALE SPEAKER: Good.

00:49:13.770 --> 00:49:15.240
Down over there.

00:49:18.129 --> 00:49:18.670
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:22.509
You mentioned
[INAUDIBLE] mutations,

00:49:22.509 --> 00:49:26.927
and also that how our
shared DNA with a chimp

00:49:26.927 --> 00:49:28.635
is incredibly similar,
[? and the only ?]

00:49:28.635 --> 00:49:30.455
real difference
control switches.

00:49:30.455 --> 00:49:31.999
Roughly, how many
of those control

00:49:31.999 --> 00:49:33.790
switches would have to
go wrong for someone

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:35.048
to give birth to a chimp?

00:49:35.048 --> 00:49:37.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.770
KAT ARNEY: Also a
fantastic question.

00:49:38.770 --> 00:49:39.920
How many control switches--

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.003
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:41.003 --> 00:49:41.705
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:41.705 --> 00:49:43.830
KAT ARNEY: How many controls
switches in the genome

00:49:43.830 --> 00:49:47.255
would we have to change to
turn a human into a chimp?

00:49:47.255 --> 00:49:49.115
[SIGH]

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:54.300
Probably not that many.

00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:58.210
Well-- and we are extremely,
extremely similar.

00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:00.980
And it's probably a few of
the key developmental genes.

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:05.230
So some of the brain
ones, obviously

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:08.490
like the hair and face thing.

00:50:08.490 --> 00:50:12.587
The bony penis business.

00:50:12.587 --> 00:50:14.420
Actually, there's a
really interesting story

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:16.690
that I had to take out of
the book about this woman

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:19.990
in Stanford who's discovered
that a lot of the switches

00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:23.210
responsible for the shape
of human faces compared

00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:27.720
to chimp faces are derived from
long dead viruses in our DNA.

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.760
So it's like,
literally these viruses

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:32.430
are the things that have made
us humans compared to chimps.

00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:36.600
So I reckon if you started
knocking out loads of those,

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:39.530
you would start to get some--
back towards something that

00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:42.875
looked more like a chimp
and less like a human.

00:50:42.875 --> 00:50:45.810
I must publish
that at some point.

00:50:45.810 --> 00:50:46.870
But yeah.

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:47.661
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:50:47.661 --> 00:50:49.280
We'll take one more question.

00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.925
The gentleman behind there.

00:50:51.925 --> 00:50:54.790
AUDIENCE: Just going back to
the Mendelian diseases, which

00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:58.119
I presume is your
repressives, dominant gene

00:50:58.119 --> 00:50:59.410
stuff we learned in [? GCSE ?].

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:02.540
One in four chance of
parents, blah, blah, blah.

00:51:02.540 --> 00:51:04.827
What makes it easy or
not easy to track down

00:51:04.827 --> 00:51:06.230
the gene responsible for that?

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:08.550
I mean, we've got cystic
fibrosis and sickle

00:51:08.550 --> 00:51:09.540
cell and [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:13.500
Is it just if you get enough
sample sizes [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:15.945
with it and without
it, you can find it?

00:51:15.945 --> 00:51:18.054
Or some diseases, you
find them [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:18.054 --> 00:51:18.720
KAT ARNEY: Yeah.

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:21.975
So some of the--
a lot of the genes

00:51:21.975 --> 00:51:23.600
that we've known
about for a long time,

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:27.170
they were really done the hard
way by tracking pedigrees.

00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:30.090
But it's still the same about
taking sections of people's DNA

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:31.424
and reading it and comparing.

00:51:31.424 --> 00:51:33.340
And there's sort of
various mapping techniques

00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:34.380
that you can do.

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:35.870
So all through
the '80s and '90s,

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:38.810
people were sort of
homing in on regions

00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:41.630
by looking for regions that
were similar between people

00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:44.450
and regions that were
different, and going, OK.

00:51:44.450 --> 00:51:45.890
All these people
with this disease

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:47.700
have broadly this area
that's all similar,

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:48.990
so it's probably in there.

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:50.948
And it took years and
years and years and years

00:51:50.948 --> 00:51:51.905
and years and years.

00:51:51.905 --> 00:51:54.030
And then with the sequencing
revolution, all you do

00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:55.405
is you take someone
who's got it,

00:51:55.405 --> 00:51:58.080
takes someone who hasn't, or a
bunch of people who've got it

00:51:58.080 --> 00:51:59.360
and a bunch of people
who haven't, and sequence

00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:01.930
them enough, and you'll
probably find some differences.

00:52:01.930 --> 00:52:04.630
And then because of what we
know about what the genome looks

00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:06.140
like, we have quite a good map.

00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:07.320
You can go, OK.

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:08.970
If this is a syndrome
that's involved

00:52:08.970 --> 00:52:11.040
in the shape of the
face, perhaps there's

00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:13.660
a gene that's involved in
cartilage growth or something

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:14.160
like that.

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:17.270
So you can make some
pretty sensible deductions.

00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:18.910
What gets more
challenging is when

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:20.860
you're looking for the
more subtle variations.

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.850
So I work for
Cancer Research UK,

00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:25.070
and we do a lot of these
studies on cancer risk.

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:27.710
And you have to take tens
of thousands of people

00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:30.090
and look for these tiny
variations between them,

00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:34.090
and take 40,000 people
with cancer, 40,000 people

00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:37.230
without cancer-- and it's got
to be the same type of cancer--

00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:41.280
and say, OK, broadly, what
marries up between having

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.390
it and not having it?

00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:46.920
And it's like--
it's a risk thing.

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:50.490
So it's starting to get very
hard to find these variations

00:52:50.490 --> 00:52:51.430
and to find new genes.

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:54.150
And people are doing bigger
and bigger and bigger studies

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:55.810
and finding less
and less and less.

00:52:55.810 --> 00:53:00.070
And I think that's
probably limited benefit

00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:01.890
to be found from
keeping pursuing

00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:04.198
those kinds of
studies, personally.

00:53:04.198 --> 00:53:05.906
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
we'll leave it there.

00:53:05.906 --> 00:53:07.614
Please join me in
thanking Dr. Kat Arney.

00:53:07.614 --> 00:53:11.230
