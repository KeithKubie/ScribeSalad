00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.180
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, it looks like they're almost ready to start the first hearing event. Susan,

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.298
what's going on, on the floor?

00:00:05.298 --> 00:00:09.735
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, people are just about ready to start the first hearing event.

00:00:09.735 --> 00:00:12.665
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And what property of hearing will this event be addressing?

00:00:12.665 --> 00:00:17.795
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; This event will test our senseletes' ability to hear different pitches.

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:20.735
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Susan, can you explain a little more about what that means?

00:00:20.735 --> 00:00:26.932
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Well, Andy, most humans can hear frequencies of 20,000 hertz. Any higher and we

00:00:26.932 --> 00:00:30.672
simply can't hear that. So, this is going to be an absolute threshold test,

00:00:30.672 --> 00:00:33.885
which means we're going to see just how high of a pitch these contestants can

00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:35.455
hear.

00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:37.975
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And how are they going to be measuring that?

00:00:37.975 --> 00:00:41.208
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; As you can see, our contestants are blind-folded and they're going to sit

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:45.160
around these speakers. Every now and then, a tone is going to play and if a

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.940
contestant hears a tone they raise their hand. If they raise their hand

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.840
incorrectly or don't hear it, they will be eliminated. The pitch will get

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.839
higher and higher until there is only one contestant left. Oh, it looks like

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:03.860
the ref is signaling for me to leave. It looks like they're ready to start.
