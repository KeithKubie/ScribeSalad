1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:05,710
You are listening to
radio lab radio from W.

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,733
N. Y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,970
Okay. Yes. Listen to
this. Yes, for a second.

4
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,190
Is that Johnny Cash? Yes.

5
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:33,640
It's Johnny Cash and he's singing
a song about the deep importance of

6
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:34,840
mathematics in your life.

7
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:47,050
It's no math here. What
are you talking about?

8
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:49,780
You know there's a lot of math here
because you see what he's doing is he's,

9
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,630
he's moving to his extinction it seems,

10
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,240
but he's being very careful to calibrate.

11
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:18,460
Oh my God, we're going to go all
the way to one later. The scene,

12
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:21,610
this song for three hours already and
numbers are making it TD. I would.

13
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,230
I would, if I were him, I'd lose the
numbers. Blue blew the numbers. Yeah.

14
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,550
You can't lose that address.

15
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,830
You cannot lose the numbers because
numbers create order in your life.

16
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,980
Could lose the numbers. I could.
I could survive an entire, well,

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,980
my whole life without them. That's
just completely ridiculous. Easily.

18
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,160
No, try me. Try me. All right. Let me
just ask you something very simple. Yeah.

19
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:44,340
You go to buy some m and m's and you
have $5 bills in your hand and you'd give

20
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:47,690
it to the vendor and the vendor gives
you back the m and m's and what?

21
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,110
No numbers required if hand him
the bill. He hands me some change.

22
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:55,280
I just go by trust. You go by trust?
Yeah. He asked you how old you are.

23
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,620
What do you say? I'm
middle aged. I tell him.

24
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,880
Okay, listen to that. You hear that?

25
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,420
Suppose that you're late for an
appointment or something like that? Yeah.

26
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,420
So you call up and you say, I'm
going to be three minutes late,

27
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,580
five minutes late, 10
minutes late. How easy.

28
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:15,630
Just wait for the call before I
leave. I know that you know it's true.

29
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:18,480
I know it was true. So yeah, don't
eat them. Don't eat your test.

30
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,920
You're taking the test in school. You
get in 98 you get a 52 you don't care.

31
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:27,000
Pass, fail. How much gas is in your card
yet? I wait for the light to come on.

32
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,660
At what? What did you
want to call me? Right?

33
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,140
Yeah. And you can't remember my
phone number. [inaudible] News.

34
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,003
How many words?

35
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,580
Yeah, you gully use numbers.

36
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,190
Hi. Hello.

37
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,470
Is that how it ends? Yeah,
that's a great ending.

38
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,910
Ending made possible all
thanks to the discipline use of

39
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,930
[inaudible] and that's
going to be our hour.

40
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:25,931
What do numbers do to us and
for a don't to for us get the,

41
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:29,730
what do we have? We have a to have
a detective story. I love stories.

42
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:34,010
Some Nazis add lots of numbers. I'm
Jad Abumrad I'm Robert Krulwich.

43
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,570
This is radio lab. Stay with us.

44
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,393
Okay,

45
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,400
so Chad, do you want to
introduce the some this person?

46
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,200
And this is a, this is a
little Ameel. He's Emile.

47
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,810
So how old is he? He's hungry right now.

48
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,930
He's about 30 Carla, how old is he?

49
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,640
36 six at the time of this
recording he is 36 days old.

50
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,360
Well I've, you must have wondered,

51
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,390
do you think he has any sense at all
of numbers or quantities or do you mean

52
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:26,050
like thing? Can he count as
I'm asking you, you count.

53
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:30,960
But like do you think he has a, I
don't know, a numeric sense at all?

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,950
Do I think he has a numeric? No. No, I
don't think he knows that he uh, that,

55
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,790
that that is his hand that he's chewing.

56
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,390
I don't think there are any
numbers in there. In fact,

57
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:41,280
I'm pretty sure there aren't. No.

58
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:43,683
Whoa.

59
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,100
Lulu [inaudible] you should
introduce yourself to a meal. A meal.

60
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:52,880
This is our producer, Lulu
Miller. And by the way, Jed,

61
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:54,610
while you were on paternity leave, we,

62
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,690
we shouldn't Lulu on a
little mission to ask,

63
00:04:56,691 --> 00:05:01,070
where does a number since come from and
how soon does it arrive in a person?

64
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,040
Hello? So this is the
first guy I spoke to.

65
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,010
His name is Stanislas de
hen speaking. Who is he?

66
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,350
He is a neuroscientist in Paris.

67
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,710
We've been brushing up my English
for a few minutes currently.

68
00:05:14,711 --> 00:05:16,720
He's like the Godfather,
this research really?

69
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,350
He wrote a whole book called the number
sense that talks all about what babies

70
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:21,730
understand. Yeah.

71
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,090
And he said that for a long time people
thought that babies came into the world

72
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:30,091
just empty Piaget and many of the
sinkers so that there is with people,

73
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,880
I've called the blank slate that we could
only learn numbers if we were taught

74
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:37,450
them. Yeah, that's what I think. Good.
No, we know it's just completely wrong.

75
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:43,150
And how do they know this?
Well, experiments, right?

76
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,860
Well lots and lots of baby experiments.

77
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:49,240
The equipment we have is a
set of little sponges, uh,

78
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:53,380
which contain a very small electrode that
you can place on the head of the baby.

79
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:54,430
It's ready to net

80
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,130
and these babies are old. Um,

81
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,640
in this case it was a babies
of two or three months.

82
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,380
So he plunks the baby down front of a
computer screen and on the screen are a

83
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:09,470
bunch of little pictures. Uh, you
know, liter ducks for instance.

84
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,000
It's always a set of eight of the same
object. So you do eight ducks feet,

85
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,600
Dax Eight, ducks patriarchs eight.

86
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,570
And what he sees is that at first the
baby's brain is a little excited about

87
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:24,800
getting to see ducks. And then it slowly,
the firing just kind of fizzles out.

88
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,040
Another eight darks

89
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,360
and then at some points
underneath he changes it to trucks

90
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,150
and he sees a spike in
brain activity in the call.

91
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,520
[inaudible] meaning the baby
can notice that change. Yeah,

92
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:42,070
but that's not number. No, no, no.

93
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:46,310
I know he's just getting started because
Dan runs the whole thing again starting

94
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:49,320
out the same way. Great darks eight dogs,

95
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,010
eight but then instead
of changing to trucks,

96
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,570
he just changes the number
eight dogs, eight dogs, 16 dogs.

97
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,700
And once again the baby
notices the chain change,

98
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,840
but now it's in a different part of
the brain which we call the palliate or

99
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,450
lobe. So the suggestion
is according to Stan,

100
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:12,710
that they're noticing that
this is a different kind of
change that in some sense

101
00:07:12,711 --> 00:07:15,290
they're noticing this
is a change in quantity,

102
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,180
which is very important because it
means that even in newborns they have in

103
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:23,660
their minds and in their brains
and intuition of numbers,

104
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,900
sure. That they're seeing numbers or
maybe they're just seeing a change in the

105
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:34,520
pattern. Some, some, some, some more.
We'll share what they're good at.

106
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:39,521
Is making these gross distinctions like
eight versus 16 let's say 10 and 20,

107
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:42,560
you know, and as the difference in
number gets smaller and smaller,

108
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:45,820
then they're not so good.
There is no baby, uh,

109
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,530
that will ever know the
difference between nine and 10.

110
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,510
These numbers are too close together,

111
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,800
but it's not quite as simple as
you might think. According to Stan,

112
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:56,030
which is most Xtandi know you.

113
00:07:56,031 --> 00:08:00,180
I think the way that they're actually
experiencing quantities is not just a dumb

114
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:01,940
down version of what adults do.

115
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,140
It's a completely different
version of what adults do.

116
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,470
They seem to care about the
[inaudible] of the number. The what?

117
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,350
The logo [inaudible] of the number
you means logarithm. Yes. Sorry,

118
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:19,010
my English is getting
really bad at logarithms.

119
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,280
I don't know if the Swedish scare
that purely listens to this show,

120
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:28,160
but it's actually not that bad. You
can think of it in terms of ice shows,

121
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,460
everything about you meaning us,

122
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,290
how we think about numbers and imagine
in your head the distance between one and

123
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:40,520
two. Okay. What is that one right now?

124
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:44,540
Imagine the distance
between eight and nine one.

125
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,960
Also they feel like the same
distance from each other. Yeah,

126
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,860
but that's because we think of numbers
in these discrete ordered chunk. One,

127
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:53,330
two, three, four frog.

128
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,660
But now if you were to think about
it logarithmically like the baby,

129
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,920
the distance between one and two is huge.

130
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:03,190
Okay?

131
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,870
It's this vast space

132
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:11,010
and the distance between eight
and nine tiny. Why is that? Well,

133
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,540
because one to two is doubling,

134
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,380
but eight to nine until
you show off close to one,

135
00:09:17,381 --> 00:09:18,870
I need one point something [inaudible]

136
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,823
okay.

137
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,750
Now, here's the spooky thing about this.

138
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,860
You might think what must happen
is that eventually as we grow up,

139
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,910
we just naturally switch from
logarithmic thinking to the numbers.

140
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:37,390
We all know now. But this is not true.

141
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,980
According to Stan. If
left to your own devices,

142
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,210
you'd never switch.

143
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,680
What do you mean you would stay
in this logarithmic world forever?

144
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:57,640
So we've done this, Eh, very
funny experiments in the Amazon,

145
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,800
uh, with people from the Amazon. We do
not count basically in their culture,

146
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,080
they do not have number words beyond
five and they don't recite these numbers.

147
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:09,800
So, um, uh,

148
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:14,650
what we found is that these people still
think of numbers in a low guide way.

149
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,590
Even the adults. What
that means is that, uh,

150
00:10:17,591 --> 00:10:21,700
if you give them a line and on the left
you place one object and on the right

151
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:22,990
you place nine objects.

152
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,200
You got that [inaudible] and he asked
them what number is exactly between one

153
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:31,940
and nine. Okay, so you'd say five exactly.

154
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,530
But would they put in the middle
is three. Three. Oh wait, help.

155
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,440
Help me here a little bit. So the, uh,

156
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:42,350
the property of [inaudible] miss that
each time you multiply the number,

157
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,470
you move by your constant
displacement. Okay?

158
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,060
So this is a bit tricky,

159
00:10:48,061 --> 00:10:52,440
but the gist is if you're thinking
in ratios and you're starting at one,

160
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,550
then you multiply by three to get
to three, right? And then, hey, hey,

161
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,240
you multiply by three again
to get tonight. I see.

162
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:04,740
So those are equal jumps on either
side. This leads to one as nine is two,

163
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:06,850
three, get it. Yeah. Well,

164
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,680
that's such a sophisticated way to
go about thinking about it yet to us,

165
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:13,980
but not to them. That feels intuitively,

166
00:11:13,981 --> 00:11:18,000
simply like the middle dozens of
people did this without hesitation.

167
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,460
I mean this experiment gives me chills.

168
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,880
These are the numbers that we
all for want of a better word,

169
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,570
naturally feel. At least that
is, that has been my, uh,

170
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,170
[inaudible] go to claim for
many years. Hmm. And I don't,

171
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,730
I don't quite know how to phrase
this question, but is there some,

172
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,930
does it almost like the way
we think about numbers with,

173
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,800
with an equal distance between
one, two, three, four, five, six,

174
00:11:46,801 --> 00:11:49,560
seven is wrong.

175
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:54,203
Hmm.

176
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,030
You know, I wouldn't go too far.
But then I talked to Susan Carrie,

177
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:02,260
I'm professor of psychology at Harvard
University and she said that numbers as

178
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:04,420
we think of them today
are certainly made up.

179
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:08,950
Those are human constructions and even
somewhat at odds with how we feel numbers

180
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:12,970
intuitively. That's right. They
are. So there is the problem then.

181
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:17,580
How do we ever come to understand
the numbers we know now that's a,

182
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,610
that's a $64,000 question.
She says it happens gradually.

183
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,050
Can you don't dish the microphone
over a couple of years? Can you count

184
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:33,340
one more quick introduction that is little
luck who you might remember from the

185
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,330
last year show. Yes. You've met marina
before and her mother, producer,

186
00:12:37,331 --> 00:12:40,340
Amanda Aronchick. She will
be two in a week. Yes,

187
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,710
it's her birthday and we've called
them in today because of an experiment,

188
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,370
credibly simple set of tasks
that Susan told me about.

189
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,640
If you have a two year old at
home, you can do these tasks.

190
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,410
We're gonna play a game. Okay, so you
put a bunch of pennies on the tape.

191
00:12:56,411 --> 00:12:59,890
I'm going to give you some pennies in
just a second note that let me get them

192
00:12:59,891 --> 00:13:04,300
for you. And you say to the
child, can you give me one penny?

193
00:13:04,301 --> 00:13:08,450
And I have one penny and the child very
carefully picks up one, enhance it. Gee,

194
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,230
that's right. That's one penny. Thank you.

195
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,500
Young two year olds almost all can
do that. Then you ask for two pen.

196
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,730
Can I have two pennies? No,
no, please can I have two?

197
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,830
And it doesn't matter what you ask for,

198
00:13:20,831 --> 00:13:24,670
they just pick up a handful and hand
them to you when the two pennies you have

199
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:28,030
like one, two, three,

200
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,990
four and so they've given you four
pennies and you say is that too?

201
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,130
And they say, yeah right and then you say,

202
00:13:36,131 --> 00:13:37,810
can you count how many
pennies? What can you count?

203
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:42,790
And make sure how many pennies
is that? So they go one,

204
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:45,760
two, three, four and you say,
is that too? She's they say yes

205
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,650
and sometimes they count. How many
pennies does that one, two, two, two.

206
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,810
So like Tom.

207
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,960
Now note that all of their other words
contrast with one in meaning that is

208
00:13:59,090 --> 00:13:59,091
there,

209
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:01,870
they're giving you a number and they're
giving you a number of more than one,

210
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,220
but they haven't the slightest idea what
two is or three years or four years or

211
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:11,221
five is and they don't know what to
means for nine months and they're in that

212
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:17,080
stage for several months and then they
become 300 hours and then they become

213
00:14:17,081 --> 00:14:20,650
four knowers. That process takes
a year and a half. In other words,

214
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,080
even though it sounds like

215
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:27,040
getting understands numbers like we do,

216
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,600
she's probably still living
in the land of that baby man.

217
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,920
But there does come a moment
when they finally step away.

218
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,480
Can you sing that song?
And it happens, right?

219
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:43,240
When the kids about three and
a half years old, what they do,

220
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,550
I think this is speculative,

221
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,750
but after years of everyone
around them saying, count,

222
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,460
can you count how many pennies you
have? This is something parents

223
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,200
do one too.

224
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,130
Discounting with with
children. Can you count

225
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,880
to ten one, five, six, two, four, five

226
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,650
[inaudible] and three

227
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:16,600
even though the kid is
baffled by the numbers,

228
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,560
five or six or seven board, five,

229
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,570
eight the line, the last one,

230
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,550
that some point, fair enough.

231
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,120
And they just sort of
throw up their hands,

232
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:44,760
believe the phone.

233
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,020
That's an a very

234
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,490
bold leap that children must make.

235
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,440
And so now what five means for
the child is one more than four.

236
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,010
Knowing what six means is one more
than five but now you've got integers.

237
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:10,830
We're all sort of like relying on
this song, like yeah, one, two,

238
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,710
just that one day decided, okay,
that means something. That's right.

239
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,660
So this is a trick.

240
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:19,680
What does she mean by that trick?

241
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,470
Sounds almost like a dirty word. She will,
she doesn't use it like a dirty word.

242
00:16:25,471 --> 00:16:29,490
She says it's a wonderful trigger
point is once you have that trick,

243
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,930
you build on it

244
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:34,020
and that opens up the whole
world of mathematics to you.

245
00:16:34,021 --> 00:16:38,340
And we can build buildings in launch
rockets into space and no other animal has

246
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,870
invented that trick.

247
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:45,080
But I can't help feeling there's something
about this that's a little bit sad.

248
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,490
Why? Well,

249
00:16:47,491 --> 00:16:51,510
just the idea that to step
into this world of numbers,

250
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,230
we all have to leave something
behind. We do. We're born with, yeah,

251
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,600
but don't look what you get on
the other side though. You get,

252
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,740
you get to play and have remarkably
interesting. If you like math,

253
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:06,420
you get to play with deeply abstract
and beautiful thoughts. So yes, yes,

254
00:17:06,421 --> 00:17:11,310
and that's great. But you feel sad
when somebody's good at trapeze work?

255
00:17:11,311 --> 00:17:11,581
No,

256
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:14,160
that's just something that they're good
at and they practice it and they learn

257
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:16,170
it. It's just like different talents.

258
00:17:16,171 --> 00:17:18,450
That's what Robert F I think I
know what Lily's talking about.

259
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,060
I mean it's refreshing somehow to know
that the numbers that we use day to day

260
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:28,220
are somehow made up because sometimes
the numbers for me at least feel like

261
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,460
these hard, fussy foreign
things that don't feel real.

262
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,200
They feel actually the opposite of
real. But you're sure sure. That

263
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:38,670
really isn't just unfamiliar or a little
strange. I mean foreign. Yeah, sure.

264
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,210
Cause when you, before you could
walk, when you were just a crawler,

265
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:46,230
you know toddling was kind of unusual
and then toddling became kind of an

266
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:50,070
adventure and then that became kind of
usual and then eventually you do walk.

267
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:52,890
But if there's something about
numbers where I feel lit personally,

268
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,210
I never learned how to walk.

269
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:56,460
And I think there was a lot of people
listening right now who probably feel that

270
00:17:56,461 --> 00:17:58,920
way about numbers. So
maybe what does that mean?

271
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,020
They'll just logarithmic people. Come on.

272
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,830
It's five three five
eight (979) 323-4626 yeah.

273
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,070
Thank you very much for that lesson. Lily.

274
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,940
Stay strong in your
opposition to integers.

275
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,920
Paul. One nine seven one six nine three
nine we'll be right back. Seven five

276
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,900
0582097494 five nine (230) 781-6406

277
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,151
hello there.

278
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:33,240
This is Amanda and Nina and we are
going to read the credits so Camino,

279
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,830
you ready? Can you say Radiolab?

280
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,440

the Alfred p Sloan Foundation,

281
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:44,280
the corporation for public broadcasting
and the National Science Foundation.

282
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:44,901
I mean it.

283
00:18:44,901 --> 00:18:49,901
Can you say National Science Foundation
Radio Lab is produced by W N Y C and

284
00:18:51,601 --> 00:18:55,380
distributed by national
public radio. Good job. Okay.

285
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:01,130

Hello, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm
Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab.

296
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:38,080
We're still talking about numbers and
now we're going to switch though it may

297
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:43,000
be, it may fatigue. Some of us, if you
think about them a little differently,

298
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,610
if you learn to embrace them
and give them a bit of a hug,

299
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:50,920
wonderful things can happen. I'm
going to introduce you to a, um, well,

300
00:19:50,921 --> 00:19:54,250
a nosy man named Mark Nigrini.

301
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,180
I'm an associate professor at the
school of business at the College of New

302
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,110
Jersey. Has a really heavy New Jersey
accent, but what he really likes to do,

303
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,610
what kind of accent was that was kind
of a, I originally grew up in Cape Town.

304
00:20:06,611 --> 00:20:11,260
South Africa. South African? Yes. Oh, he
likes to play detective and the clues.

305
00:20:11,261 --> 00:20:13,240
He looks for distinct numbers. I,

306
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:16,690
I can't walk past the number
without just wondering about it.

307
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:20,390
I went into that number.
How did it get there?

308
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,430
For example, after I finished
filling up at a gas station,

309
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:29,960
sometimes I would just walk around and
look at the dollar amounts on the pump.

310
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,950
So he peaks in at the pump right
next door and it's rather amazing.

311
00:20:33,951 --> 00:20:36,410
You can almost tell
who's been there before.

312
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,730
If you see a number like
a dollar 40 then you know,

313
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,820
oh teenager with no money.
Why wait, explain that.

314
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,740
Cause that's all the kid
can afford. Quite right.

315
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,460
Sometimes I'll see $10 and 4 cents

316
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:52,330
and I'll say, oh you meant to be
$10 but you were a bit slow today.

317
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:57,370
So you'd go to the gas pumps tell
you all little short stories. Yes.

318
00:20:57,550 --> 00:21:02,550
And his favorite story that numbers tell
actually starts back in 1938 so imagine

319
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:08,890
an office in Schenectady, New York
at the GE research laboratories.

320
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:12,490
And in that office is a man
and he's sitting at his desk,

321
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:16,780
Mr. Frank Benford and Mr.
Frank Benford is a physicist.

322
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:19,750
So he's doing some difficult
calculations and hunched over a book,

323
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,030
probably actually the one of the
most boring books you could imagine.

324
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,820
This is a book of logarithmic
tables. And what a logarithmic table.

325
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,000
So a lot locked tables where a very
convenient way of doing multiplication in

326
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:35,650
the early part of the last century.

327
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,050
So remember this is before
there were calculators.

328
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:43,051
So if you want it to multiply something
like 145 times 3,564 you could just go

329
00:21:45,131 --> 00:21:48,820
to this book and look it up.
So it starts with numbers.

330
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:53,290
You might want to multiply by one new a
hundred on the first page and then 101

331
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:57,700
and two up to 200 and 300 and the back
of the book is like nine hundreds the

332
00:21:57,701 --> 00:21:58,361
further you go,

333
00:21:58,361 --> 00:22:01,660
the higher and higher the numbers
you use to multiply that trade.

334
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,920
So our Benford fellow,

335
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,950
he's sitting there doing miscalculations
and he's looking at the numbers

336
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,870
flipping to the bone. They staring at
the pages and this something clean.

337
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:15,530
You notice that the first few pages
were more worn than the last few pages,

338
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:20,120
meaning were smudgy and darker oily as
if he was using the front of the book

339
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:24,230
more than the last few pages.
Any wonder why is this happening?

340
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,400
Dreams. We're favoring one part
of the book over the other.

341
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,470
Am I doing something a little?
Huh? Where? Maybe it's something

342
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,260
and that's when it hit him.

343
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:41,760
He thought maybe in this world they
are more numbers with loafers digits.

344
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,110
Then with heifers, digits.

345
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,890
What more numbers that
start with one or two.

346
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:52,630
The numbers that start with seven, eight
or nine just because his book is more,

347
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,450
that's where, that's what started
him thinking, so here's what he did.

348
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:59,580
He compiled some tens of thousands
of statistics that Steve Strogatz

349
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,310
mathematician at Cornell University,

350
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,770
just anything he could think of that
was numerical molecular weights of

351
00:23:04,771 --> 00:23:07,920
different chemicals, baseball
statistics, census data,

352
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:12,390
revenues of all the companies listed on
the main stock exchanges in America and

353
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,930
everywhere. He looked in all these
different categories. It seemed,

354
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,360
guess there were more numbers
beginning with one in twos,

355
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,600
that eights and nines
wait, really? Oh yeah.

356
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:26,180
This has been checked out again
and again and again and it's true.

357
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,830
It's eyes of rivers, earthquakes
and things like that.

358
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,040
Populations or a number of deaths
in a war, areas of counties,

359
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,640
stream flow data. What if you were to say,

360
00:23:35,641 --> 00:23:38,400
get all the people in New York together
and look at their bank accounts,

361
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,080
bank account balances,

362
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:45,410
follow benfits loan Uri perfectly meaning
that if you just look in it amount of

363
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:46,394
money that people have,

364
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:50,600
matter of fact being all the bankers
you'll find they begin with one more often

365
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:52,580
than they begin with too. Perfectly. Yes,

366
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,120
so actually they begin
with one 30.1% of the time.

367
00:23:56,121 --> 00:24:01,121
They'll begin with a to 17.6% of the
time they'll begin with a three 12.5% of

368
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:03,590
the time. That's a,
that's a big difference.

369
00:24:03,591 --> 00:24:08,570
Why was three Eby I'm sorry I keep going
and the poor nine would any occur as a

370
00:24:08,571 --> 00:24:10,910
first digit 4.6% of the time,

371
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:16,160
which actually would make
the one approximately six
times as likely as the mine

372
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,010
and he just quite amazing. That
is more than quite amazing.

373
00:24:19,011 --> 00:24:20,870
That's deeply suspicious. I mean,

374
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,380
this is crazy what I'm telling you and
I can't give you good intuition why it's

375
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:27,350
true. But Steve and mark and many, many,

376
00:24:27,351 --> 00:24:30,320
many mathematicians would tell
you despite what you may think,

377
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:34,730
there is a preference, a
deep preference in the world.

378
00:24:34,731 --> 00:24:39,710
It seems for number sequences that
start with ones and then twos and then

379
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,640
threes. I'm Robert [inaudible]. Mm.

380
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:45,823
So what?

381
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:56,080
Well, this is not just a
mathematical curiosity, jazz noon.

382
00:24:56,081 --> 00:25:00,440
I know there is something you can do
with this information. Right? Well,

383
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,500
when Mark Nigrini first
ran across Benford's law,

384
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:06,080
he thought, [inaudible]

385
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:07,680
maybe I can use this law

386
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,480
to bust people

387
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,330
for payroll fraud tax
return for you thought, hey,

388
00:25:14,331 --> 00:25:17,470
we can use this to catch a
thief. That's right. Huh?

389
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:21,360
How willingly Nigrini figured if you
look at a bunch of numbers that they

390
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,890
bank statements or
expense reports and so on,

391
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:28,780
and you see that the numbers
in the business do not
match the natural pattern of

392
00:25:28,781 --> 00:25:29,451
Benford's law.

393
00:25:29,451 --> 00:25:33,100
So the numbers don't begin with ones
more than two's moving with twos,

394
00:25:33,101 --> 00:25:34,300
one with threes and so on

395
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:39,680
could say, hey, this is not
natural. This may not be true,

396
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,210
this may be

397
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,083
fraud.

398
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:47,750
So we started giving lectures on the idea
that Binford is a way to catch these.

399
00:25:47,751 --> 00:25:50,750
The only problem was they didn't
quite believe Benford's law,

400
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:55,220
which means the rest of my talk
isn't going to go anywhere.

401
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,860
It is now my great
pleasure to introduce you,

402
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,280
one of the most fabulous people
I've ever had the name to say,

403
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,770
Daryl d Doro

404
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,580
[inaudible] look [inaudible]
definitely, totally,

405
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:16,360
definitely lead illiterate to literally
of heaven. It's like palindromic. Yeah.

406
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:22,280
Itch Gerald Darell. Oh Wow. And um,

407
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,570
but I should say Daryl is a, what
did you call it? They calls it,

408
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:27,670
I'm a forensic accounting
forensic accountant.

409
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:31,660
[inaudible] which means his job is to
examine numbers and figures to see if

410
00:26:31,661 --> 00:26:34,300
someone is stealing. It's
an investigative process.

411
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,010
And while at first he was unsure about
Benford's law, but skeptical. One day I

412
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,360
happen to talk to one of
my neighbors who was a, uh,

413
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,340
retired professor

414
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,810
and he said, Oh, Benford's I have my
students do that proof every year.

415
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:54,030
He actually wrote out the proof for
me. And it's just, it's immutable

416
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:00,270
mathematical law. And now it's one
of his favorite tools of history.

417
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:03,720
We have a case right now underway,
relatively small company,

418
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,210
family shareholders there four of them.

419
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,430
One of them feels like she has been
misrepresented as a shareholder.

420
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,210
Meaning she thinks these other three
guys may be stealing [inaudible] yes,

421
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,400
I yes. And I know you can't tell us what
this business is doing, but is it a,

422
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:23,670
it's a, it's a, a regulated business.

423
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:26,783
Uh,

424
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:31,320
it's a business that each of you purchase
on a regular basis through your local

425
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:36,280
governmental authority, trash
collection or Su Ranger.

426
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,880
Anyway, this one woman thought
that she was being cheated,

427
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:43,110
so she got an attorney involved.
The attorney requested data.

428
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,460
So we have seven years of income
tax returns and that's all he had.

429
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,110
Just tax returns. [inaudible] yes. So
he edited them all into the computer,

430
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,140
aggregates them, run Benford's
and clicked on the graph.

431
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:59,040
We instantly saw Vango
for a couple of the years.

432
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,650
Coincident with when the dispute began,

433
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:06,750
the way they've reported their taxes
violates Benford's very suspicious.

434
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:08,790
Yes. Blew out the Benford's pattern.

435
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:11,520
You mean like there are too many
nines on the tax returns? Meaning.

436
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:13,830
If you look at the tax
returns at this company,

437
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:16,890
you will see a pattern that
isn't natural. Exactly.

438
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,690
Not enough ones and too many
sevens, eights and nines,

439
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,130
but now you have to convince detectives
and then lawyers and then judges.

440
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:28,860
This is real evidence of wrong doing,
but they've not heard of this thing.

441
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,450
Benford's don't know about it.

442
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:35,160
As a practical tool has probably
been around maybe 10 years,

443
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,530
maybe 15 at the outset.

444
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,440
I'm at a conference now. What about 700 to

445
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:45,443
all of you here?

446
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:49,930
I've spoken four times and each
time I've asked about Benford's,

447
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,210
who's heard of it? Who's familiar
with veterans law? Maybe,

448
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:58,570
maybe 5% of the people. Can
you just look at pennies?

449
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:01,760
Couple observations to meet doesn't
make sense to exclude the community.

450
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,680
Use Ben for your same result
and they're asking you,

451
00:29:04,681 --> 00:29:09,150
judges allow Benford's in as evidence
suggest that someone's committed a crime

452
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,040
case law out there that actually cite
the use of Benford and Daryl tells them,

453
00:29:14,041 --> 00:29:17,520
oh yeah, yes, you can use this
evidence in court. Yes, federal,

454
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:19,980
state and local from the
experiences we've had.

455
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:25,010
And then he tells them stories like the
case of the CEO stealing money to buy

456
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,180
automobile firearms, wear jewelry
in Benford's and then you shoot you,

457
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:34,110
you're still in federal prison or
the case of the dentist and his wife,

458
00:29:34,111 --> 00:29:37,710
she began having an affair with a guy
who turned out to be a meth dealer.

459
00:29:37,711 --> 00:29:42,590
The dentist suspected her of having dipped
into the till run Benford's and boom,

460
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,691
busted.

461
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:48,691
She eventually pled or the guy with a
$40 million Ponzi scheme run Benford's

462
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:54,190
well almost boom. I mean, benefits
was an element in all these cases.

463
00:29:54,191 --> 00:29:55,150
It wasn't the clincher,

464
00:29:55,151 --> 00:30:00,151
but still it is a very compelling argument
and then 10 years from now it'll be

465
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:02,140
the equivalent of a fingerprint.

466
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,153
[inaudible]

467
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:16,770
that's it. Huh? W you still having
addressed the central mystery here,

468
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:20,180
why in the world, whether
it be more ones than nine,

469
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:24,460
shouldn't they be equally, uh,
equally coincident? Yes. Well,

470
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:28,980
the answer is actually very
complicated in deeply mathematical.

471
00:30:28,981 --> 00:30:31,710
The simple answer is, is
there an answer though? Yes,

472
00:30:31,711 --> 00:30:36,510
there is an answer and it has to do, do
you understand the answer? No. I mean,

473
00:30:36,511 --> 00:30:38,940
I understand that it has to
do with logarithms and the,

474
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:42,570
and the business of doubling
and the culture of numbers.

475
00:30:42,571 --> 00:30:46,380
But if you were to sit me down and say,
explain it to me carefully and, well,

476
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:51,120
I mean, no, it's just too new
metrics for me to explain it to you.

477
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,403
Okay. All right.

478
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:57,180
But I will now take a little sidestep to
a group of people who would be able to

479
00:30:57,181 --> 00:30:59,070
explain it to us if
they were in this room.

480
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,940
But we didn't find them in this room.
We found them in, in other rooms.

481
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,220
We're rarely in the same
room that they are. Yeah.

482
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:09,150
So let's go with our reporter Ben Calhoun
and meet a crowd of mathematicians.

483
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,720
Ben. Yup. You decided to,

484
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,930
I don't know what some kind of a
busman's holiday you want, right?

485
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:18,490
They go to a math conference.
I did madly. And what happened?

486
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:22,480
Well, I went to CUNY, which is
the City University of New York,

487
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,330
and it was a math conference called,

488
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,340
it was on Combinator burial and
additive number theory. Oh, a good time.

489
00:31:30,341 --> 00:31:34,000
Had by all, yeah. It goes by
the optimistic acronym. Can't.

490
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,080
So I had heard that if I
went to this room, no tables,

491
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:43,150
there was going to be a bunch of
mathematicians from all over the place.

492
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,770
[inaudible] from Sweden attending and
they would be able to tell me where they

493
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,240
condoms college, what their name was,

494
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:54,460
but they would have this other way
of identifying themselves. Right.

495
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:58,600
They had this number, my
numbers, two, three, two,

496
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:03,520
three, three, two minus three
actually. Oh, nice. Yeah,

497
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:07,170
I'm really excited about it. What, what
is the, what does it mean? Right too?

498
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:11,030
I'm with three. Well, it's an air
dish number. What's an ear dish?

499
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,800
Ear dish is a guy. Oh,

500
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:17,890
so your air dish number is how many
steps away you are from this Guy Paul air

501
00:32:18,741 --> 00:32:21,820
dish. So you're going to tell me his
story. Yup. Hey, you ready? Okay,

502
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,940
let me turn off my cell phone
so we don't ruin the best cake.

503
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:27,920
That's Paul Hoffman. He wrote
a book about Paul Air Dish.

504
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,350
So we start out in Budapest,
Hungary in 1913 at spring,

505
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:36,820
two math teachers have a son
named Paul and he had two sisters.

506
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:40,250
They were three and five and they
had scarlet fever and they died

507
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,030
the day he was born. I mean,

508
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:47,750
imagine that his mother loses her
two daughters and gains a son.

509
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,120
Oh my God. Yeah.

510
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,990
She was so terrified after that that
Paul would get a fatal disease and die,

511
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:57,920
that she didn't let him leave the house
pretty much for the first 10 years of

512
00:32:57,921 --> 00:33:00,860
his life. She didn't let
him play with other kids.

513
00:33:00,861 --> 00:33:05,780
Really didn't let him go to school,
didn't let him go outside. Also,

514
00:33:05,781 --> 00:33:06,410
when he was wanting to,

515
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:11,390
half his dad was captured and put in a
Soviet prisoner of war camp for six years

516
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:12,224
of his life.

517
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,730
So here's this kid at home
without other children around.

518
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,200
His mother is out teaching mathematics,
all the books in the house for math.

519
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,250
And he taught himself basically to
read by looking at these math books.

520
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:30,160
And he also said to me, the numbers
became my best friends. So I mean,

521
00:33:30,161 --> 00:33:34,300
here's a kid who's, you know, whole
life is mathematics from the beginning.

522
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,890
But let's fast forward.

523
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:42,100
Paul Erdish gets his phd in his early
twenties this is in the early 1930

524
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,900
he's [inaudible]

525
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,250
Paul Air dish is Jewish,

526
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,330
which means he knows that he's
got to get out of Hungary,

527
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,940
that he managed to get
to the United States,

528
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,760
but he has to leave his family behind.

529
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,420
[inaudible]

530
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,820
when the Nazis moved into Budapest,

531
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:03,150
four of his mother's five
siblings were killed.

532
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:06,780
His father died as they were hurting
Jews and trying to move them into the

533
00:34:06,781 --> 00:34:08,910
ghetto, and he only had his mother left,

534
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,720
but she was in Hungary and in 1941 Paul
[inaudible] was at Princeton University.

535
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,900
He was just 27 years old,

536
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:24,630
completely cut off from his family.
He was lonely and he was homesick.

537
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,940
I mean, this guy had no
conventional friendships.

538
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:28,710
He had no sexual relationships.

539
00:34:28,711 --> 00:34:32,430
His only contact with the girl
was the people he worked with.

540
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:34,870
[inaudible].

541
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:35,201
I mean, there's,

542
00:34:35,201 --> 00:34:39,610
what's remarkable to me is other people
who had been through this kind of life

543
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:44,140
experience might have ended up in a mental
institution or worse, but he didn't.

544
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:49,410
He turned this sort of inwardness into
making mathematics a joyous and social

545
00:34:51,011 --> 00:34:54,610
occasion. He started connecting
with people, I don't get this. Like,

546
00:34:54,611 --> 00:34:57,520
what do you mean? Well,
he started traveling.

547
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,870
He would hear about somebody who was
working on something interesting and he

548
00:35:01,871 --> 00:35:04,810
would find a way to get
there, show up at their door,

549
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:08,170
and he had this phrase that he
would say, my brain is open.

550
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:13,180
And he was there to work with them on
whatever it was that they were working on

551
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,820
and he just kept moving,

552
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,550
made a circuit of 25 different countries.

553
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:23,580
Eventually he gave up almost all of his
possessions and he became essentially

554
00:35:24,071 --> 00:35:26,890
homeless. He had no home, he had no home.

555
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:31,900
So everywhere he went people had to
put him up. And as a house guest,

556
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:35,770
the man was an acquired taste. He
didn't know how to do basic things.

557
00:35:35,771 --> 00:35:38,280
He couldn't cook, he couldn't
even boil water for tea,

558
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,890
could barely change his clothes,

559
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,040
didn't know how to tie his own shoes
until he was 11 he had some kind of skin

560
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:48,000
condition, so they only wore silk,
silk clothes. You had to wash.

561
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:51,570
I mean he went through life this
way and there was the schedule.

562
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,320
He did mathematics 20 to 22 hours a day.

563
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:59,800
He'd bang pots and pans around in the
kitchen at 4:00 AM because he wanted you

564
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:01,570
to come downstairs and do more math.

565
00:36:01,571 --> 00:36:03,730
So why would anybody want
a visit from this guy?

566
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:05,290
This sounds like a walking nightmare.

567
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:08,350
You have to cook for him or stay with
him and wash his clothes regardless of

568
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:12,820
your shoes, regardless of all of it.
You wanted him to come see you. Why?

569
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:16,570
Because he was just that good.

570
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,650
This was like God coming to visit
you. He knew your strengths,

571
00:36:20,651 --> 00:36:23,740
he knew how you thought and it
was fascinating to watch him.

572
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:27,430
I mean there were times like I
went with him to a math conference,

573
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,670
aims there in his hotel room and at
one point there were like 10 or 12

574
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:33,220
mathematicians in the room.
Some are sprawled on his bed,

575
00:36:33,221 --> 00:36:37,330
some are sitting on the floor and he'd
be working with one for a few minutes and

576
00:36:37,331 --> 00:36:40,630
then he would turn to another and then
he'd go back to a third and he was

577
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:44,440
working simultaneously with all
these people in different problems.

578
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:49,620
Paul Air Dish wrote more
papers and collaborated with
more people than any other

579
00:36:50,171 --> 00:36:53,740
mathematician who's ever lived.
He did mathematics with anybody,

580
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:56,380
even if the person was a dim bulb,

581
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:01,440
well did mathematics. Now let
me just, what's this people do?

582
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,870
This is Paul Arish on his 80th birthday.

583
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:10,120
That's the only dovish by an old man you
can say is no easy cue of the incurable

584
00:37:11,221 --> 00:37:16,221
disease or fly surrounded by a lot of
the mathematicians who loved him and put

585
00:37:17,671 --> 00:37:20,980
him up in their house. We
want to express our deep,

586
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:26,110
warm feelings to you and I want
to raise this stones for you.

587
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,270
He was a saint, I think a saint.

588
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,450
That's Joel Spencer. He's a mathematician.

589
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,610
He was also friends with Paul air dish.

590
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,700
Now that he is is gone.

591
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,760
I think of him sometimes in a
religious context because he,

592
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,230
he gave this faith to those of
us that are doing mathematics,

593
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:57,110
which after all is if you
look at it from the outside,

594
00:37:57,111 --> 00:37:59,510
it's a little bit of a strange activity.

595
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:04,190
While you put this enormous
effort into finding these,

596
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,630
these statements,

597
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:10,910
mathematicians will spend years of their
lives trying to prove these things that

598
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:16,260
you know from the outside look
totally obscure and pointless.

599
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,480
And yet it was clear working with him
that what we were doing was we were trying

600
00:38:22,031 --> 00:38:27,031
to find truth with the capital t truth
that transcends our physical universe.

601
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:36,060
I think that's the reason why we like
to about our connection to Paul because

602
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,430
our feeling of mathematics,

603
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:47,490
the feeling for what we want mathematics
to be Paul Erdish was the embodiment.

604
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,740
Somewhere along the way,

605
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:59,040
mathematicians started keeping track of
their connection to Paul air dish and

606
00:38:59,351 --> 00:39:01,750
that's what air dish numbers actually are.

607
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,380
If you published a paper with
polarity, your erudition number is one.

608
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,040
If you published a paper with someone
else and they published a paper with Paul

609
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,280
Air dish, then your erudition
numbers too and so on and so on.

610
00:39:12,281 --> 00:39:17,200
So this is like all the people that Paul
air additions some way has touched all

611
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:20,380
the people who are connected
to him through their ideas.

612
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:23,900
There are about 500 people with editors,

613
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,720
number one and about 8,000
people with their address number.

614
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:31,430
This is professor Jerry Grossman at
the University of Oakland in Michigan.

615
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:36,400
And what he did was he took each ring
of erudition numbers and he charted it

616
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:37,234
out.

617
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:41,110
Heritage number three has
about 34,000 people in it, uh,

618
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:45,110
about 84,000 with their addition number
four, then they start decreasing.

619
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,320
What are you done for the house?
And that's a lot of people.

620
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:52,080
If you go ring upon ring upon ring
in you and you do the whole deal,

621
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:55,800
like how many people did this
man in the end influence?

622
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,760
I think it's about 200,000 mathematicians,

623
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,850
200,000

624
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:03,360
[inaudible]

625
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,750
200,000. Picture that for a second.

626
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:12,410
It's like a solar system with more than
200,000 mathematicians all orbiting

627
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,340
around Paul Air Dish

628
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:20,970
[inaudible]

629
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:25,560
and your air dish number is one one.

630
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,833
Yes.

631
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,220
Dennis Eichorn is a number two
and the edition number is two.

632
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:34,280
I wrote a paper with uh,

633
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:38,010
my advisor and the other students and she
had written a paper with mathematician

634
00:40:38,011 --> 00:40:41,190
who had written a paper with
parents. My oldest number is three.

635
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:45,840
Your air number is one and everybody with
heritage number one knows that they've

636
00:40:45,841 --> 00:40:48,150
got that host. Everybody in
this room knows their number.

637
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:51,500
I would be very surprised if Kara

638
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:04,260
[inaudible],

639
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:09,260
Ben Calhoun's erudition number is oh
0.5778 dash p minus one Gallico six coming

640
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:15,240
up, a story from our
friend Steve Strogatz,

641
00:41:15,241 --> 00:41:18,810
the mathematician from Cornell
who tells about a friendship.

642
00:41:18,811 --> 00:41:21,720
He has a very precious
friendship with his math teacher.

643
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,240
So it's all about mathematician,

644
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,220
but this is a very unusual
friendship and Chad have,

645
00:41:26,221 --> 00:41:27,990
I'm Robert Krulwich stick around.

646
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:31,860
This is Christine Stone
from Maplewood, New Jersey.

651
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:55,450
okay. Okay. I'm Jana. Boom.

652
00:41:55,451 --> 00:42:00,100
Rod. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab.
Our topic today is mathematics,

653
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:04,450
mathematics, and mathematics.
I suppose that is our topic,

654
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:08,560
but actually we do have a gripping
story for you coming up now from our

655
00:42:08,561 --> 00:42:12,370
producers, Soren Wheeler. Hey, sarin
pate. And this is about math, right? Yeah.

656
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,130
Well math and friendship really.

657
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:17,410
And I heard it from Steve Strogatz.

658
00:42:17,411 --> 00:42:20,770
He's a mathematician at Cornell University
and he's been on the show once or

659
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,120
twice. Okay.

660
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,720
And we sat down in the studio and he
told me about why don't you back up and

661
00:42:25,721 --> 00:42:29,170
tell me a little bit about high school
and about his high school math teacher,

662
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:31,120
Don, Joffrey. Well,

663
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:35,020
there were several striking and
peculiar things about him. I mean,

664
00:42:35,021 --> 00:42:39,640
probably the first thing is that he was
physically incredibly impressive when

665
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,660
would hold the chalk between his
enormous fingers and right on the board.

666
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,840
The chalk would pulverize with each
stroke so that there'll be this cloud of

667
00:42:46,841 --> 00:42:50,740
chalk dust all over him and
his big sweater. And um,

668
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,460
another thing that was
very unusual about him,

669
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,490
he'd be in the middle of the
calculation standing at the board,

670
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:00,730
jock dust all over him as
usual. Then he would space out,

671
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,160
let me get a look in his eye, a kind of
far away look, and then he'd say, Oh,

672
00:43:06,161 --> 00:43:09,520
this reminds me with the hush tone. Oh,

673
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,510
this reminds me of the time Jamie Williams
calculated the formula for the end of

674
00:43:13,511 --> 00:43:15,220
term in the Fibonacci sequence,

675
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,880
and he gave me Jamie
Williams with a student.

676
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,270
He was just a couple of years ahead
of Steve and Mr Joffrey's class,

677
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,920
and that was part of the Mystique,

678
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:31,560
you know that now he was graduated
and it was as if the secret was,

679
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:33,760
was lost to the ages,

680
00:43:33,761 --> 00:43:37,090
but the point was that he would
talk about a student with reverend.

681
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,260
With Reverend, yeah.

682
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:42,790
What was very thrilling about that is
that there was this kind of chain that we

683
00:43:42,791 --> 00:43:44,200
were now becoming part of.

684
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:52,780
Yeah. So then I'm off to college
and it was, it started very early.

685
00:43:52,781 --> 00:43:57,520
I started to write to him, it was
like an annual tidbit or dear,

686
00:43:57,521 --> 00:44:01,720
Mr Joffrey, here's the gym that
I learned this year in math.

687
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,090
So Steve would write to him, Mr Joffrey
would write back, add something,

688
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:08,470
ask them a new question.

689
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:12,250
And that went on like that for awhile
with Steve kind of still being like a

690
00:44:12,251 --> 00:44:15,160
student and Mr Joffrey
still like a teacher.

691
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:20,550
There was one moment though
where something new happened
where he wrote to me

692
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,200
asking for help.

693
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:28,180
He said a question came up in his class
about an elliptical swimming pool.

694
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,340
So you know,

695
00:44:30,341 --> 00:44:35,341
picture a swimming often there's a
little border on the edge of the swimming

696
00:44:35,431 --> 00:44:37,920
pool, like a piece of
concrete that lines the pool.

697
00:44:37,921 --> 00:44:41,310
You stand on that part before
jumping in. And so the question was,

698
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:44,910
if you had an elliptical swimming
pool with a one foot border around it,

699
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:47,820
is the outer edge of the
border also on the lips.

700
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,770
Something about that really appealed
to me. It was a very nice math problem.

701
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,280
Probably there was a little
bit of a show off in me.

702
00:44:56,281 --> 00:44:59,940
Like I thought if I could do this,
he's gonna say something Nice.

703
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,760
You'll become part of the, yeah,
maybe I'll enter the Pantheon.

704
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:06,750
They'll start talking about me. Like
they used to talk about Jamie Williams.

705
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:07,680
So I,

706
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,800
I stopped whatever I was doing and I
worked hard on that ellipse lips problem

707
00:45:10,801 --> 00:45:14,220
and I figured out two or three different
ways to turns out it's never an ellipse

708
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,780
if it cannot be an ellipsis.

709
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:20,280
He sat down and wrote back to
Mr Joffrey about this puzzle,

710
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,680
but I didn't just show him the answer.

711
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:28,220
I wrote the answer in a very loving
and gentle way that was meant to be

712
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,020
empathetic. That is,

713
00:45:31,021 --> 00:45:35,250
I know where you're coming from and I'm
going to just start from scratch to lead

714
00:45:35,251 --> 00:45:38,580
you from where you are to where you
need to be to solve this problem.

715
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:39,301
In other words,

716
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:43,980
Steve acted like he was the teacher and
Mr Joffrey played along and this was

717
00:45:43,981 --> 00:45:47,340
such a generous thing. In retrospect,
the humility, the modesty,

718
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:50,550
the kindness in playing
the role of a student.

719
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:54,000
It's like he knew that that's what I
needed and man, I loved it. I would,

720
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:56,890
I couldn't wait for the
next question and his,

721
00:45:56,891 --> 00:46:00,270
Steve went off to graduate school
to become a math professor himself.

722
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:03,390
He and Mr Joffrey kept writing
to each other. In fact,

723
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,910
they were writing to
each other quite a lot.

724
00:46:05,911 --> 00:46:10,350
There was one sequence in March of 1989
where we wrote to each other almost

725
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,183
every year.

726
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:14,040
[inaudible]

727
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:18,120
he sent me a puzzle. I worked on it. I
showed them a really beautiful answer.

728
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:21,690
He expressed kind of ecstasy
and seeing this answer

729
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:29,610
[inaudible] it was kind
of a mathematician's dream
correspondence of puzzles and

730
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:34,590
equations and Steve loved
it. But every so often

731
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:39,660
Mr Joffrey would break
the routine a little bit.

732
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:43,710
He would say things about that.
He was doing some jazz piano gig.

733
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:45,990
You would sometimes write
about, he had three sons.

734
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,320
He would talk about them a little bit
and you know, I feel embarrassed I,

735
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:50,250
it feels mean,

736
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:54,600
but I remember not liking those parts
of the letters and I didn't write about

737
00:46:54,601 --> 00:46:58,830
that. I mean, I would say maybe I
was playing some tennis or, but I,

738
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,640
I have lines in some of my letters that
say after a few of those sentences,

739
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,190
okay, enough stalling,
here's the math problem.

740
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:10,830
But then in later years he would
almost pointedly ask me things like,

741
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:14,760
there was a time when he said that
rumor has it that you're engaged,

742
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,920
we wish you the best. If this is true.

743
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,030
And guess what? In my letter back
to him, I didn't say anything.

744
00:47:24,090 --> 00:47:28,260
Do you remember like thinking
not to respond or just, well, I,

745
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,840
I can tell you what was going on,
which is that I was already, uh,

746
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:36,850
in couple therapy with
my fiance, you know,

747
00:47:36,851 --> 00:47:41,140
like in that time the letters
were kind of refuge from all that.

748
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:43,441
That is,

749
00:47:43,441 --> 00:47:48,180
we could go into this pristine world of
math where things are simple and logical

750
00:47:48,181 --> 00:47:49,590
and well-ordered

751
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,840
there may have been part of me
that felt like I'll come on,

752
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,690
this is the one place
where it's all perfect.

753
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:00,481
But over the years,

754
00:48:00,481 --> 00:48:04,680
that perfect world got a little less
perfect because his oldest son died.

755
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:10,140
Marshall died, Marshall
died when he was only 27.

756
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:13,790
And uh, I didn't ask about it.

757
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:19,040
Can you believe this? I feel so sick
about this when I think about it now.

758
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:22,900
So you would just write back,
oh I've got another plug,

759
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:27,170
got another math problem for
you. Look at this. Um, yeah.

760
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:33,530
And then more than 20 years into
this relationship letter writing,

761
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:38,840
Mr Joffrey retired and now that he
couldn't teach anymore, he'd write to me,

762
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,770
he'd show me these beautiful math
problems that he would make up from self,

763
00:48:42,771 --> 00:48:46,130
usually about hawks flying
over the earth and you know,

764
00:48:46,131 --> 00:48:49,280
how much severe Brickell area can
the Hawk see if it's at such and such

765
00:48:49,281 --> 00:48:50,840
altitude. Um,

766
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:54,890
and what is happening at this time is
that now I have just gotten married and

767
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:58,280
we've started having kids and I'm
not answering his letters anymore.

768
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:01,250
They're sitting in our
envelope stacking up.

769
00:49:01,251 --> 00:49:03,980
He's riding them faster than I
can answer them a lot faster.

770
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:08,340
And then at one point I got one
more letter from Mr Joffrey,

771
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:14,240
except as soon as I looked at the envelope
I could see that something was really

772
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:19,980
very wrong. His handwriting
didn't look normal. The,

773
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:24,390
my address, my name was written
in a craggy like shaky, shaky.

774
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:28,290
And I knew what that looked like cause
my dad wrote like that when he had

775
00:49:28,291 --> 00:49:30,450
Parkinson's. So I thought,
what, what's this?

776
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:34,230
And I opened the letter and the first
sentence is [inaudible] I just had a mild

777
00:49:34,231 --> 00:49:38,440
stroke. I didn't write
back to him right away.

778
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:43,980
I didn't call him. And then
just a couple months later,

779
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:49,130
my brother died very suddenly in and
he heard about it from someone else and

780
00:49:50,811 --> 00:49:54,210
immediately wrote to me how,
you know that he was fair.

781
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:57,350
He and his wife had heard and they were
very sorry to hear that my brother had

782
00:49:57,351 --> 00:50:02,300
died. That to me was um, you know,

783
00:50:02,301 --> 00:50:07,210
I still had never said I'm sorry about
Marshall all those years ago and uh,

784
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,770
it kept nagging at me.

785
00:50:09,771 --> 00:50:13,040
I want you to talk to him beckoning
and obviously care about him.

786
00:50:13,550 --> 00:50:16,910
It's sort of like in math, there's
this concept of bifurcation,

787
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:19,400
which really means a fork
in the road, a splitting.

788
00:50:19,401 --> 00:50:21,920
When the forces on a system get too large,

789
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:27,350
there can be a moment when the dynamics
of that system change abruptly.

790
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:30,873
Qualitative

791
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:32,650
[inaudible]

792
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:34,240
this was a moment of bifurcation.

793
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:40,210
We should've just said how sorry I
was to hear about about Marshall.

794
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:46,200
So I, I thought I got to
go talk to him and ask him,

795
00:50:46,201 --> 00:50:49,840
can I come to your house? You know,
he seemed a little reluctant about it,

796
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:54,550
but you know, okay, fine. So I
bought a little pocket tape recorder,

797
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:56,830
just a cheap thing.

798
00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:02,140
Drove up route 95 to his house in
Connecticut on the shore and knock on the

799
00:51:02,141 --> 00:51:05,290
door, hear the piano that was
playing inside stop. He comes in,

800
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:07,750
rushes to see me and we
give each other hugs.

801
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:12,340
Take out a big plate of cold cuts
and say, let's sit out on the porch.

802
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:17,140
So that work. Hello? So we're,
we're eating and recording.

803
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:18,970
Then he takes out his German.

804
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:23,190
I decided that I would keep a journal
since I was retired where he's drawing

805
00:51:23,191 --> 00:51:26,940
pictures of all kinds of birds and
there's a picture of me doing an ego watch

806
00:51:26,941 --> 00:51:30,210
out in the Connecticut River and there's
a lot of stuff about [inaudible] and

807
00:51:30,211 --> 00:51:32,080
his typical way, I don't know,

808
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:36,390
like this is a bird that's moved up from
the south too. You never saw these one.

809
00:51:36,391 --> 00:51:40,320
What some people call buzzards.
Yeah, they've moved up here. And

810
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:43,740
uh, this is one of my favorite birds.

811
00:51:43,741 --> 00:51:47,720
It's a marsh hawk and the
flies low over the meadows. Uh,

812
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:51,150
more about that. Hank says, ah,

813
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:54,690
I'm going to take you over to
see a rough legged hawk now.

814
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,260
He didn't say we're gonna see if we
can see a rough Leggett hawk. Yeah,

815
00:51:59,470 --> 00:52:01,090
he produced [inaudible]

816
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:06,250
and I'm thinking to myself, I don't,
not really interested in this.

817
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:08,770
I want to talk about him, about
all these things that are,

818
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:13,630
that we never talked about that are
emotional hard things. Like what happened?

819
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:14,790
How did your son die? Yeah,

820
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:15,780
a lot of work.

821
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:20,910
They're just trying to make guys put
in extra hours to pay guys extra hours.

822
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:25,170
There was a fidgeting feeling inside
me and benefits and other stuff

823
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:28,680
and um, there was a pause.

824
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,220
My heart was beating fast

825
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:37,820
then I thought I'm going to ask them now.

826
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,320
I don't think we ever talked about
Marshall, but I want it at night. I did.

827
00:52:42,321 --> 00:52:46,040
I asked what, I didn't really
know him either, but he,

828
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:50,000
I know that he died very young
and I what, what happened? No,

829
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:54,940
what happened to Marshall? Well wait,

830
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:58,260
you know, that's helpful. You don't
really want to talk about that.

831
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:03,560
And I think he's going to say that's
something we don't talk about well was if

832
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,240
he had ever met as a star,

833
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:09,840
did he?

834
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,570
He did. He had a wonderful 27 years.

835
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:20,890
Music was gone. It was
so beautiful. And so, um,

836
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:23,830
and so uplifting and sweet.

837
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:26,540
He'd be at home and we'd
sit around the piano

838
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:29,970
and I'll get out the Cole porter
song go can just turn to a page,

839
00:53:29,971 --> 00:53:33,270
something that he'd never seen.
He could sight read it, play it,

840
00:53:33,271 --> 00:53:36,660
and sing it all in one time
with us. And I thought, God,

841
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:40,740
this guy's got a multichannel
nine that I wish I had. You know,

842
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:45,480
he talked about what a great, what
a great life he had in his 27 years.

843
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:50,320
In his waning moments, he'd stay up
all night long playing the piano,

844
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:53,460
just the house, which is
filled with beautiful music.

845
00:53:55,470 --> 00:54:00,470
And he had made plans to get a job at
the New England conservatory and things

846
00:54:00,481 --> 00:54:05,040
like that. But the
faiths were wrong before.

847
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:17,790
Oh yeah, we miss it.

848
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:27,530
Was, was that, I mean in that moment did,

849
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:28,860
did it

850
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:31,120
changed the way you see
him or will it change?

851
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:33,190
I have to tell you how that day ended.

852
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:37,420
So we talked more and I
asked him at one point,

853
00:54:37,421 --> 00:54:39,250
do you think Marshall
had a religious feeling?

854
00:54:39,251 --> 00:54:44,251
And he said he didn't think he felt
close to having the come to terms with

855
00:54:44,801 --> 00:54:48,110
somebody out there. Yeah,
that was a good thing that,

856
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:50,380
that I think he went peacefully.

857
00:54:51,270 --> 00:54:56,080
Then actually conversation drifted to
easier things like calculus problems and

858
00:54:56,081 --> 00:54:58,120
we talked to more about
math and then he said,

859
00:54:58,121 --> 00:54:59,920
how about a swim or let's go to the beach,

860
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:04,690
go out to the beach and I
could do something where I
get outdoors a little bit.

861
00:55:04,691 --> 00:55:07,070
So we did go to the beach and um,

862
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:11,780
it was a beautiful evening and there
were waves coming in from long island

863
00:55:11,781 --> 00:55:15,470
sound. In fact, we were talking
about a math problem about waves,

864
00:55:15,471 --> 00:55:19,250
about fourier analysis,
which is really about,

865
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:24,140
well infinity in the fact that if you
take an infinite number of simple waves,

866
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:28,370
you can create any shape of wave you
want as long as it's a wave that repeats.

867
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:30,590
But then Mr Joffrey asks,

868
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:35,240
how do you create waves that
don't repeat waves that change?

869
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:40,070
Sometimes waves don't exactly
repeat. They can grow or die out.

870
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:43,700
And Steve told him that to
deal with those kinds of waves,

871
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,070
you need a different kind of infinity,

872
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,730
not the kind where you just keep
adding and adding and adding numbers.

873
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:54,290
But the kind that sits in the
space between two numbers,

874
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:59,740
this higher kind of infinity than
don had thought about before.

875
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:16,603
[inaudible] [inaudible]

876
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:24,450
thanks. Juicer and wheeler, because you
interviewed Steven produced that story.

877
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:27,480
Thanks to Steve Strogatz
who has the book out now,

878
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,720
which tells this very story
called the calculus of friendship.

879
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:35,700
I'm Jad Abumrad meaning seconds to
do. You are Robert Goldberg. Bye.
