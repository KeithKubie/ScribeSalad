00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
At the end of my video on misconceptions,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I mentioned the supposed fact that people swallow 8 spiders a year while sleeping,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
but unlike the other misconceptions in that video which I explained away,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I turned this one into a cheap joke and left it at that.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This wasn't because it's true, but because the story behind that myth turns out to be a bit of a mystery.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The first place that I remember coming across the 8 Spiders fact was years ago on the lid of a Snapple can.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Snapple used to print facts of dubious value on their drinks, and though they've tried to hide it,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The Wayback Machine reveals that, "8 Spiders," was one of them.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Take a trip to Snopes.com, the go-to site for debunking urban legends of all kinds,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and, sure enough, the 8-Spiders-A-Year thing is listed.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Scroll down and Snopes says the story comes from Lisa Holst in 1993, when email was still fairly new

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
for most people and messages with subjects like:

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
RE:RE:FWD:RE:RE:FWD: AMAZING FACTS!!

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
were a higher proportion of network traffic.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Lisa Holst, says Snopes, wrote an article called, "Reading is Believing," in PC Professional, listing all kinds of made up facts that people would believe,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and 8-Spiders-A-Year was one of them.
This, I thought,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
was the perfect misconception to finish the video, like a little moral on why you should be less credulous.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Out of interest, I went looking for the article to see what other fake facts she mentioned,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
but Googling for her brought up nothing.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Well, not literarily nothing, but nothing helpful; moslty it's other articles debunking the 8-Spiders myth

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
using the exact same language as the Snopes article, which looks suspicious.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Intrigued, I contacted Snopes myself about their source, but got back a formed reply.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I don't know if ignoring their contact form is their usual way of doing business,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
along with copy-paste blocking and pop-under-ads,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but it seemed odd for a site dedicated to exposing the truth.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Further digging yielded other articles about people like myself, trying to find Lisa Holst and verify Snopes' version of the story.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
There's a page on Metafilter and Stack Exchange and even a website called eightspiders.com that went looking for her.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The guy who runs that last one even went so far as to contact the Library of Congress, who said they didn't know of any magazine called, "PC Professional."

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Which leaves us in an odd, XKCD kind-of mood about Snopes.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
If the Lisa Holst-version of the story is real, then why can't anyone find any record of her or her article?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And, if it's not real, is it just a mistake on Snopes' part?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
If so, why haven't they replied to any of the people who brought it to their attention?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Or, perhaps we've gone through the looking glass, and the Lisa-Holst-made-up-the-8-Spiders-fact IS the myth,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
promulgated by none other that Snopes themselves.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It wouldn't be the first time, as Snopes does have a purposely fake article on the site claiming that Mr. Ed was actually a zebra.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I wasn't able to go any further than this, but if you happen to know anything about Lisa Holst or the deal with Snopes,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
please feel free to get in touch.
