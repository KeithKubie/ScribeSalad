00:00:00.908 --> 00:00:04.308
Voiceover:We've seen that
a function maps elements

00:00:04.308 --> 00:00:06.101
from its domain.

00:00:06.101 --> 00:00:08.644
If you give it an element in its domain

00:00:08.644 --> 00:00:11.708
it will then map it to
an element in its range.

00:00:11.708 --> 00:00:13.109
So for example,

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:14.775
if this is the domain.

00:00:14.775 --> 00:00:16.840
Let me do this in this orange color.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.567
If this is the domain of a function

00:00:19.567 --> 00:00:20.909
and let me just pick out

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:22.377
some random elements right over here.

00:00:22.377 --> 00:00:24.967
So let's say that this is one.

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:26.975
This is negative one.

00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:28.773
This is seven.

00:00:28.773 --> 00:00:30.440
And this is pi.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.842
Let's say these are all members

00:00:31.842 --> 00:00:33.640
of the domain of f.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.710
And let's say that f and let's say

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.245
that this right over here is the range.

00:00:38.245 --> 00:00:41.639
So this is right over here is the range.

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:45.372
And so let's say that f of one, f of one.

00:00:45.372 --> 00:00:47.508
So if you input one into the function,

00:00:47.508 --> 00:00:54.836
the function maps one to
the number negative three.

00:00:54.836 --> 00:00:58.305
And let's say it maps
the number negative one

00:00:58.305 --> 00:01:02.179
So f of negative one is equal to,

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:03.978
is equal to seven.

00:01:03.978 --> 00:01:06.779
And let's say that f of seven,

00:01:06.779 --> 00:01:11.380
f of seven is equal to 10.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.510
But let's says that f of pi

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.103
is also equal to 10.

00:01:16.103 --> 00:01:17.378
So this is the function map.

00:01:17.378 --> 00:01:18.644
Again this is a legitimate function.

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:20.641
Remember in order to be a function

00:01:20.641 --> 00:01:23.907
for any input it has to map it to a unique

00:01:23.907 --> 00:01:26.302
it needs to map it to only one output.

00:01:26.302 --> 00:01:27.707
This wouldn't be a function

00:01:27.707 --> 00:01:29.235
if it did something like this.

00:01:29.235 --> 00:01:32.105
If you input pi instead of
saying you're gonna get 10

00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:35.979
instead of saying that
f of pi is equal to 10.

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:36.839
This is clearly a function.

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:38.443
You're mapping from pi to 10.

00:01:38.443 --> 00:01:41.446
For the input pi you know
you're gonna get the output 10.

00:01:41.446 --> 00:01:42.245
But if you were doing some type

00:01:42.245 --> 00:01:44.367
of a relationship where you said oh well

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:47.304
if you put in a pi sometimes it's a 10

00:01:47.304 --> 00:01:49.437
and sometimes it's an 11.

00:01:49.437 --> 00:01:51.045
Now this would not be a function

00:01:51.045 --> 00:01:53.243
cause you're mapping pi

00:01:53.243 --> 00:01:55.380
to two different values right over here.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.377
So that's not allowed if you're thinking

00:01:57.377 --> 00:01:58.238
about a function.

00:01:58.238 --> 00:02:02.313
For any input you have
to map it to only one,

00:02:02.313 --> 00:02:03.166
only one output.

00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:06.175
Now you could have two inputs
that map to the same output

00:02:06.175 --> 00:02:07.033
because this is predictable.

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:08.500
You know that f of seven is 10

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.043
and you know that f of pi is 10.

00:02:11.043 --> 00:02:13.369
Well what I wanna do is now think about

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:17.174
when does a function not
when it is not invertible?

00:02:17.174 --> 00:02:18.645
We've already seen that the inverse

00:02:18.645 --> 00:02:24.578
of a function should map
between an element of its range

00:02:24.578 --> 00:02:28.038
and the corresponding
element in the domain.

00:02:28.038 --> 00:02:31.435
So the inverse of f should map three,

00:02:31.435 --> 00:02:33.166
negative three to one.

00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:34.366
So f inverse.

00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:39.372
So because because f of one, f of one.

00:02:39.372 --> 00:02:40.839
Actually let me write it this way.

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:41.509
Actually I'll just write it.

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:44.710
Because f of one was
equal to negative three

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.643
f inverse, f inverse of negative three.

00:02:49.643 --> 00:02:51.912
And the inverse function
is also a function.

00:02:51.912 --> 00:02:53.444
So it has to have the same
properties of a function.

00:02:53.444 --> 00:02:55.445
It should map to only one thing.

00:02:55.445 --> 00:02:59.179
F inverse of negative three
is going to be equal to one.

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:05.246
F inverse of seven is going
to be equal to negative one.

00:03:05.246 --> 00:03:08.377
F inverse, this is f
inverse right over here.

00:03:08.377 --> 00:03:10.307
But now we have something
strange happening

00:03:10.307 --> 00:03:11.778
if we think about let me write this down.

00:03:11.778 --> 00:03:15.444
F inverse of seven is
equal to negative one.

00:03:15.444 --> 00:03:16.975
That makes sense because we already knew

00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:21.712
that f of f of negative
one is equal to seven.

00:03:21.712 --> 00:03:24.307
But now something interesting
happens over here.

00:03:24.307 --> 00:03:28.706
What would f inverse of 10 be?

00:03:28.706 --> 00:03:29.979
Well f inverse of 10

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:31.635
if I'm trying to map it 10

00:03:31.635 --> 00:03:33.507
there's two elements of the domain

00:03:33.507 --> 00:03:34.772
that when I applied the function

00:03:34.772 --> 00:03:37.573
got us to 10 in the range.

00:03:37.573 --> 00:03:39.037
So if you're taking, if you're trying

00:03:39.037 --> 00:03:40.439
to see whether f is invertible

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:44.167
then the inverse function
should map this element

00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:45.976
to only one element of the domain.

00:03:45.976 --> 00:03:48.840
But its mapping it to two
elements of the domain.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.906
So is this equal to seven
or is this equal to pi?

00:03:55.906 --> 00:03:58.445
And because the inverse
mapping can't be done

00:03:58.445 --> 00:04:01.039
where you only map it with a unique thing

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:03.501
this function is not invertible.

00:04:03.501 --> 00:04:06.712
This is not not invertible.

00:04:06.712 --> 00:04:09.774
The inverse mapping, the inverse mapping

00:04:09.774 --> 00:04:11.175
from the range to the domain

00:04:11.175 --> 00:04:13.906
the inverse relationship
is not a function.

00:04:13.906 --> 00:04:17.242
It does not it can't take
an element in our range

00:04:17.242 --> 00:04:19.833
and map it to a unique
element to the domain.

00:04:19.833 --> 00:04:20.567
For 10 we don't know.

00:04:20.567 --> 00:04:23.566
Does that map to pi or
does that map to seven?

00:04:23.566 --> 00:04:25.500
So this function f is a function.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.572
For any member of its
domain it goes to a unique

00:04:27.572 --> 00:04:31.712
it goes to its a very well
defined element in the range.

00:04:31.712 --> 00:04:33.704
But the other way around isn't true.

00:04:33.704 --> 00:04:35.105
For the inverse function

00:04:35.105 --> 00:04:37.103
for any element in this set

00:04:37.103 --> 00:04:39.505
it doesn't go to only
one element in that set.

00:04:39.505 --> 00:04:42.375
This 10 could be mapped
to either pi or seven

00:04:42.375 --> 00:04:44.441
so f inverse so another way

00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:47.501
to think about this is
not an invertible f.

00:04:47.501 --> 00:04:49.113
F is not invertible.

00:04:49.113 --> 00:04:52.828
F is a function but the inverse
mapping is not a function

00:04:52.828 --> 00:04:56.351
so we do not so we would say
that f is not invertible.
