that is an internal logic and

then and this is where I'm asking you
how would you define if there's a need

the hell is architecture if you develop

the hell is architecture if you develop
a concept called design that may not be

00:35:43.850 --> 00:35:46.270
there was anything and why would anybody
want that that's the real question why

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:46.280
want that that's the real question why
 

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:48.190
want that that's the real question why
did these two people want that why do we

00:35:48.190 --> 00:35:48.200
did these two people want that why do we
 

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.650
did these two people want that why do we
yeah yeah in other words I constantly

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:50.660
yeah yeah in other words I constantly
 

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:53.680
yeah yeah in other words I constantly
ask myself why if that's the case and I

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:53.690
ask myself why if that's the case and I
 

00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:54.140
ask myself why if that's the case and I
agree

00:35:54.140 --> 00:35:54.150
agree
 

00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:57.500
agree
with you that it in most cases it is why

00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:57.510
with you that it in most cases it is why
 

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:59.690
with you that it in most cases it is why
would anybody want architecture by

00:35:59.690 --> 00:35:59.700
would anybody want architecture by
 

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:03.319
would anybody want architecture by
itself without design why not you know

00:36:03.319 --> 00:36:03.329
itself without design why not you know
 

00:36:03.329 --> 00:36:07.220
itself without design why not you know
try and get both because well well one

00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:07.230
try and get both because well well one
 

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:08.839
try and get both because well well one
theory that would come out of this is

00:36:08.839 --> 00:36:08.849
theory that would come out of this is
 

00:36:08.849 --> 00:36:11.900
theory that would come out of this is
there's no evidence that they do there's

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:11.910
there's no evidence that they do there's
 

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:13.670
there's no evidence that they do there's
no evidence that anybody really ever

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:13.680
no evidence that anybody really ever
 

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.430
no evidence that anybody really ever
wants architects in fact if they think

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440
wants architects in fact if they think
 

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.710
wants architects in fact if they think
that architects of designers really just

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720
that architects of designers really just
 

00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:20.870
that architects of designers really just
being confused right it's correct right

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880
being confused right it's correct right
 

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.720
being confused right it's correct right
so I mean if there's no evidence that

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:23.730
so I mean if there's no evidence that
 

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:27.260
so I mean if there's no evidence that
anybody wants that architecture they

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:27.270
anybody wants that architecture they
 

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:29.120
anybody wants that architecture they
really want design and they call it what

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:29.130
really want design and they call it what
 

00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:30.260
really want design and they call it what
they want cuz they don't know the

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:30.270
they want cuz they don't know the
 

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:32.390
they want cuz they don't know the
difference but the interesting thing is

00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400
difference but the interesting thing is
 

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:36.500
difference but the interesting thing is
they do know the difference because my

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:36.510
they do know the difference because my
 

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:38.920
they do know the difference because my
clients are the people that I work with

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:38.930
clients are the people that I work with
 

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:42.140
clients are the people that I work with
know the difference between me and Frank

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:42.150
know the difference between me and Frank
 

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:44.990

good or bad they do know the difference

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:46.770
good or bad they do know the difference
 

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:50.029
good or bad they do know the difference
and they don't want what they consider

00:36:50.029 --> 00:36:50.039
and they don't want what they consider
 

00:36:50.039 --> 00:36:53.079
and they don't want what they consider
to be the problems or the problematic

which which would translate in terms of
 

00:36:58.079 --> 00:36:59.269
which which would translate in terms of
the discussion is they don't want

the discussion is they don't want
 

00:36:59.279 --> 00:37:00.289
the discussion is they don't want
architecture they don't want

when somebody doesn't want you what they
 

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:07.039
when somebody doesn't want you what they
don't want is architecture it's not that

know you know who they are and it was a
 

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:26.539
know you know who they are and it was a
brutalist project you know probably

00:38:26.539 --> 00:38:26.549
brutalist project you know probably
 

00:38:26.549 --> 00:38:27.920
brutalist project you know probably
would have been the first brutalist

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:27.930
would have been the first brutalist
 

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:34.130
would have been the first brutalist
project in the United States and when it

project in the United States and when it
 

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.210
project in the United States and when it
came in over a hundred percent I said

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:37.220
came in over a hundred percent I said
 

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.529
came in over a hundred percent I said
screw it I'm out of here

00:38:39.529 --> 00:38:39.539
screw it I'm out of here

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:15.710
I would say that we could point to many
architects who were not avant-garde in

architects who were not avant-garde in
 

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:19.440
architects who were not avant-garde in
fact

Renaissance most of what we talked about
 

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:27.980
Renaissance most of what we talked about
wasn't I mean the avant-gardist were

Bramante comes along we're in the high
 

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:36.120
Bramante comes along we're in the high
Renaissance you know high period and

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:36.130
Renaissance you know high period and
 

00:44:36.130 --> 00:44:38.790
Renaissance you know high period and
Palladio is a Mannerist is not Mannerist

00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800
Palladio is a Mannerist is not Mannerist
 

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.650
Palladio is a Mannerist is not Mannerist
is certainly not out on guard if

00:44:40.650 --> 00:44:40.660
is certainly not out on guard if
 

00:44:40.660 --> 00:44:44.130
is certainly not out on guard if
anything my work would be Mannerist or

anything my work would be Mannerist or
 

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:47.220
anything my work would be Mannerist or
late Mannerist in this Komachi sense of

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:47.230
late Mannerist in this Komachi sense of

great architecture is the way and I

00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:57.940
great architecture is the way and I
 

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:00.030
great architecture is the way and I
think one of the mistakes we make in

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.040
think one of the mistakes we make in
 

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:03.510
think one of the mistakes we make in
teaching these people is that what they

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520
teaching these people is that what they
 

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.240
teaching these people is that what they
should be searching for is the new which

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:06.250
should be searching for is the new which
 

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:08.850
should be searching for is the new which
is actually what design is about that

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:08.860
is actually what design is about that
 

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.400
is actually what design is about that
the market is about the search for the

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:11.410
the market is about the search for the
 

00:45:11.410 --> 00:45:13.980
the market is about the search for the
new and the confusion is the new and the

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:13.990
new and the confusion is the new and the
 

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:17.670
new and the confusion is the new and the
avant-garde so we should be really

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680
avant-garde so we should be really
 

00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:21.660
avant-garde so we should be really
careful but I mean I as you know for me

00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:21.670
careful but I mean I as you know for me
 

00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:23.190
careful but I mean I as you know for me
yeah architectural haven't got is a

yeah architectural haven't got is a
 

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.450
yeah architectural haven't got is a

it's not possible to the to the extent

it's not possible to the to the extent
well I'm saying it to the extent that it

well I'm saying it to the extent that it

is that every one guy's challenge so

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:44.170
is that every one guy's challenge so

cultural level is the representation of

cultural level is the representation of
 

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:52.950
cultural level is the representation of
stability in order and memory and so on

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960
stability in order and memory and so on

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:57.190
avant-garde is dedicated to undermining

avant-garde is dedicated to undermining
so to that extent at the at the public

00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:00.340
so to that extent at the at the public
 

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:02.370
so to that extent at the at the public
official level that cannot be an

00:46:02.370 --> 00:46:02.380

official level that cannot be an
architectural level guide they can be

00:46:03.990 --> 00:46:04.000
architectural level guide they can be
 

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.440
architectural level guide they can be
and have on God but in that moment there

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:07.450
and have on God but in that moment there
 

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:09.060
and have on God but in that moment there
have been moments and in that moment it

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:09.070
have been moments and in that moment it
 

00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:10.710
have been moments and in that moment it
doesn't it will not register as

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720
doesn't it will not register as
 

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:22.890
doesn't it will not register as
architecture in time well I think

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:22.900
 
 

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:27.990
 
of liqueur Busey was a radical drawing

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000
of liqueur Busey was a radical drawing
 

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.280
of liqueur Busey was a radical drawing
of its time I can't think of many more

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:32.290
of its time I can't think of many more
 

00:46:32.290 --> 00:46:34.290
of its time I can't think of many more
it was presented as an image yeah but

00:46:34.290 --> 00:46:34.300
it was presented as an image yeah but
 

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:35.370
it was presented as an image yeah but
let's say stay with that one it was

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:35.380
let's say stay with that one it was
 

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:38.130
let's say stay with that one it was
present presented as an image not by

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:38.140
present presented as an image not by
 

00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:41.370
present presented as an image not by
accident of efficiency right even the

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:41.380
accident of efficiency right even the
 

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:42.960
accident of efficiency right even the
presumption of that diagram is that the

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:42.970
presumption of that diagram is that the
 

00:46:42.970 --> 00:46:44.820
presumption of that diagram is that the
walls would be produced by the rubble of

00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:44.830
walls would be produced by the rubble of
 

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:47.400
walls would be produced by the rubble of
the war right so in other words it's

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:47.410
the war right so in other words it's
 

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:49.860
the war right so in other words it's
about the how to get the most from the

00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:49.870
about the how to get the most from the
 

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:51.990
about the how to get the most from the
least and Buckminster Fuller terms and

00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000
least and Buckminster Fuller terms and
 

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.780
least and Buckminster Fuller terms and
so it was presented as the new ordering

00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:54.790
so it was presented as the new ordering
 

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:58.110
so it was presented as the new ordering
system and as an image of control so it

00:46:58.110 --> 00:46:58.120
system and as an image of control so it
 

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:00.840
system and as an image of control so it
was it was a you could say yes it's a

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:00.850
was it was a you could say yes it's a
 

00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:04.410
was it was a you could say yes it's a
radical drawing yes it it became a

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:04.420
radical drawing yes it it became a
 

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:08.070
radical drawing yes it it became a
weapon in a wide-ranging transformation

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:08.080
weapon in a wide-ranging transformation
 

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:10.650
weapon in a wide-ranging transformation
of the way architects are producing

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:10.660
of the way architects are producing
 

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.230
of the way architects are producing
buildings but you can't say that that

00:47:13.230 --> 00:47:13.240
buildings but you can't say that that
 

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:16.670
buildings but you can't say that that
drawing is a vanguard in the sense of

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680
drawing is a vanguard in the sense of
 

00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:20.340
drawing is a vanguard in the sense of
the work of heaven God artists all right

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:20.350
the work of heaven God artists all right
 

00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:23.190
the work of heaven God artists all right
but so whose whose images whose images

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200
but so whose whose images whose images
 

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.260
but so whose whose images whose images
had to represent the opposite had to

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:25.270
had to represent the opposite had to
 

00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:28.080
had to represent the opposite had to
represent and and and so in a way you

00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:28.090
represent and and and so in a way you
 

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:31.760
represent and and and so in a way you
could say the Domino drawing is the is

00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:31.770
could say the Domino drawing is the is
 

00:47:31.770 --> 00:47:36.180
could say the Domino drawing is the is

the is the birth of order after war
right and the everyone guard is

00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:06.530
 
 

00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:10.240
 
the engagement of music and words and

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:10.250
the engagement of music and words and
 

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:15.620
the engagement of music and words and
performance and instrumentation so you

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:15.630
performance and instrumentation so you
 

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:17.750
performance and instrumentation so you
could call that avant-garde even though

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760
could call that avant-garde even though
 

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.460
could call that avant-garde even though
people thought it was junk at the time

00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:19.470
people thought it was junk at the time
 

00:49:19.470 --> 00:49:24.290
people thought it was junk at the time
okay right so it we look back on things

00:49:24.290 --> 00:49:24.300
okay right so it we look back on things
 

00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:27.740
okay right so it we look back on things
as you can't set out to be I don't think

and the other I would hate to say

and the other I would hate to say
 

00:51:04.410 --> 00:51:06.230
and the other I would hate to say
technocratic because that's putting a

pejorative on it if you're in that field
 

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:14.060

it's all good if you're gonna argue that

00:51:14.060 --> 00:51:14.070
it's all good if you're gonna argue that
 

00:51:14.070 --> 00:51:16.490
it's all good if you're gonna argue that
which would make a school of design yeah

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:16.500
which would make a school of design yeah
 

00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:19.040
which would make a school of design yeah
that would make a school of design a

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:19.050
that would make a school of design a
 

00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:22.400
that would make a school of design a
school that says to society we can

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:22.410
school that says to society we can
 

00:51:22.410 --> 00:51:25.190
school that says to society we can
design anything tell us what you want

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200
design anything tell us what you want
 

00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:28.130
design anything tell us what you want
and we can do it we're talking about and

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:28.140
and we can do it we're talking about and
 

00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:30.770
and we can do it we're talking about and
we can distinguish between a good design

00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:30.780
we can distinguish between a good design
 

00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:33.290
we can distinguish between a good design
and a bad design because it'll be which

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:33.300
and a bad design because it'll be which
 

00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:36.320
and a bad design because it'll be which
one is smoother more efficient more

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:36.330

programming in other words it can be

00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:37.730
programming in other words it can be

programming in other words it can be
perfected so tell me if that if it's a

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:40.830
perfected so tell me if that if it's a
 

00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:42.710
perfected so tell me if that if it's a
kind of industrialization of what of

kind of industrialization of what of
 

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.390
kind of industrialization of what of
architecture so let me ask you a

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400
architecture so let me ask you a
 

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.670
architecture so let me ask you a
question if that if we accept that as a

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680
question if that if we accept that as a
 

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:51.080
question if that if we accept that as a
definition and we accept that there's a

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:51.090
definition and we accept that there's a
 

00:51:51.090 --> 00:51:54.470
definition and we accept that there's a
difference and we're gonna put my more

00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480
difference and we're gonna put my more
 

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:58.130

modest disciplinary distinction between
 

00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:01.280
modest disciplinary distinction between
architecture and design why is it that

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:01.290
architecture and design why is it that

we don't make those distinctions in the

we don't make those distinctions in the

school that I would say stands for

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:12.540
school that I would say stands for
 

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:21.970

00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:25.970

we still have to zoom in on we have to

we still have to zoom in on we have to
 

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:41.060
we still have to zoom in on we have to
zoom in on the design architectural idea

00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:41.070
zoom in on the design architectural idea
 

00:52:41.070 --> 00:52:42.290
zoom in on the design architectural idea
but nobody we've got the design side

00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:42.300
but nobody we've got the design side
 

00:52:42.300 --> 00:52:45.500
but nobody we've got the design side
right kind of figured out which the

right kind of figured out which the

us to architecture and to which I

00:53:40.359 --> 00:53:40.369
to do with shelter even if it's not
 

00:53:40.369 --> 00:53:41.710
to do with shelter even if it's not
shelter itself but the lasing

00:53:41.710 --> 00:53:41.720
shelter itself but the lasing
 

00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.800
shelter itself but the lasing
emplacement and the body and so on but

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:44.810
emplacement and the body and so on but
 

00:53:44.810 --> 00:53:47.430
emplacement and the body and so on but
as you know my position would be

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440
as you know my position would be
 

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:50.910
as you know my position would be
architecture does not shelter anything

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:50.920
architecture does not shelter anything
 

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:56.339
architecture does not shelter anything
in fact shelter is an idea right and

00:53:56.339 --> 00:53:56.349
in fact shelter is an idea right and
 

00:53:56.349 --> 00:53:58.809
in fact shelter is an idea right and
architecture does not shelter the human

00:53:58.809 --> 00:53:58.819
architecture does not shelter the human
 

00:53:58.819 --> 00:54:00.700
architecture does not shelter the human
body the human body does not exist as

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:00.710
body the human body does not exist as
 

00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:03.490
body the human body does not exist as
such without this idea of shelter

00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:03.500
such without this idea of shelter
 

00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:08.319
such without this idea of shelter
shelter is is the beginning of producing

00:54:08.319 --> 00:54:08.329
shelter is is the beginning of producing
 

00:54:08.329 --> 00:54:10.270
shelter is is the beginning of producing
an image of that thing called the body

00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:10.280
an image of that thing called the body
 

00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:12.880
an image of that thing called the body
right so architects in that sense don't

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:12.890
right so architects in that sense don't
 

00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:15.400
right so architects in that sense don't
design for bodies they design by this

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:15.410
design for bodies they design by this
 

00:54:15.410 --> 00:54:17.410
design for bodies they design by this
and every architect here is associated

00:54:17.410 --> 00:54:17.420
and every architect here is associated
 

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:20.380
and every architect here is associated
with their work a kind of image of what

00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:20.390
with their work a kind of image of what
 

00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:27.760
with their work a kind of image of what
body is those that want to kind of more

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:27.770
body is those that want to kind of more
 

00:54:27.770 --> 00:54:31.329
body is those that want to kind of more
easily tie architecture to this sort of

00:54:31.329 --> 00:54:31.339
easily tie architecture to this sort of
 

00:54:31.339 --> 00:54:32.710
easily tie architecture to this sort of
smooth relationship with culture and

00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720
smooth relationship with culture and
 

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.599
smooth relationship with culture and
therefore the cultural demand for order

00:54:34.599 --> 00:54:34.609
therefore the cultural demand for order
 

00:54:34.609 --> 00:54:37.720
therefore the cultural demand for order
security control and so on will

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:37.730
security control and so on will
 

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:39.520
security control and so on will
endlessly in public identify

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:39.530
endlessly in public identify
 

00:54:39.530 --> 00:54:41.890
endlessly in public identify
architecture with the stability and

00:54:41.890 --> 00:54:41.900
architecture with the stability and
 

00:54:41.900 --> 00:54:53.490
architecture with the stability and
certainty of the human body of place

00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:53.500
 
 

00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:55.569
 
phenomenology was it that way to say

00:54:55.569 --> 00:54:55.579
phenomenology was it that way to say
 

00:54:55.579 --> 00:54:56.440
phenomenology was it that way to say
that right

00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:56.450
that right
 

00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:58.930
that right
our analogy was the way to say it and

00:54:58.930 --> 00:54:58.940
our analogy was the way to say it and
 

00:54:58.940 --> 00:55:01.089
our analogy was the way to say it and
all of that suggested that you could

00:55:01.089 --> 00:55:01.099
all of that suggested that you could
 

00:55:01.099 --> 00:55:06.220
all of that suggested that you could
that modernity modernity and that from

00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:06.230
that modernity modernity and that from
 

00:55:06.230 --> 00:55:07.900
that modernity modernity and that from
that point of view is perceived of as a

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:07.910
that point of view is perceived of as a
 

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:10.599
that point of view is perceived of as a
form of assault and even a kind of

00:55:10.599 --> 00:55:10.609
form of assault and even a kind of
 

00:55:10.609 --> 00:55:13.470
form of assault and even a kind of
military assault because in its a in its

00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:13.480
military assault because in its a in its
 

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:17.260
military assault because in its a in its
origin on this precious party but no

00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:17.270
origin on this precious party but no
 

00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:20.400
origin on this precious party but no
longer well yeah okay but so so

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:20.410
longer well yeah okay but so so
 

00:55:20.410 --> 00:55:22.660
longer well yeah okay but so so
modernity is seen of as a form of

00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:22.670
modernity is seen of as a form of
 

00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:25.150
modernity is seen of as a form of
assault and therefore the therefore what

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:25.160
assault and therefore the therefore what
 

00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:27.790
assault and therefore the therefore what
the architect does is try to modulate

00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:27.800
the architect does is try to modulate
 

00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:33.069
the architect does is try to modulate

surface so you deliver both and that's
 

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:09.680
surface so you deliver both and that's
what I mean by divided you deliver both

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:09.690
what I mean by divided you deliver both

01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:57.130
red herring so I think you have to
 

01:25:57.130 --> 01:25:59.340
red herring so I think you have to
perform and you have to build yeah I

01:25:59.340 --> 01:25:59.350
perform and you have to build yeah I
 

01:25:59.350 --> 01:26:02.340

it's like saying there's got to be a

it's like saying there's got to be a

really thinking about when they're

really thinking about when they're

painting and it's and delivering
 

01:26:27.130 --> 01:26:28.560

be surprised by that observation and and
 

01:26:37.570 --> 01:26:39.840

that surprised that maybe there's a big

that surprised that maybe there's a big
 

01:26:39.850 --> 01:26:42.000
that surprised that maybe there's a big

about when they produce the work and
 

01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:46.020
about when they produce the work and
what it is that they call on to say the

my point of view every architects of
theorists the indication of what we're

01:37:45.530 --> 01:37:45.540
theorists the indication of what we're
 

01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:46.790
theorists the indication of what we're
saying is that the architect is an

01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800
saying is that the architect is an
 

01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:48.590

intellectual right then an architecture

01:37:48.590 --> 01:37:48.600

thinks about the meaning of objects and

thinks about the meaning of objects and
 

01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.790
thinks about the meaning of objects and
the relationship of objects of society

01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800
the relationship of objects of society

so what we do is think so it's very when

01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:55.290
so what we do is think so it's very when
 

01:37:55.290 --> 01:37:57.140
so what we do is think so it's very when
we get to the in it and we've got a

01:37:57.140 --> 01:37:57.150
we get to the in it and we've got a

we've got a privileged relationship to
the question of thinking because it just

01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:04.410
the question of thinking because it just
 

01:38:04.410 --> 01:38:07.070
the question of thinking because it just
happens that architecture is used by

01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:07.080
happens that architecture is used by
 

01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:10.340
happens that architecture is used by
society as a kind of image of thought in

01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:10.350
society as a kind of image of thought in
 

01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:13.280
society as a kind of image of thought in
action right so not only do we think a

01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:13.290
action right so not only do we think a
 

01:38:13.290 --> 01:38:15.260
action right so not only do we think a
lot about architecture think about the

01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:15.270
lot about architecture think about the
 

01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:17.300
lot about architecture think about the
meaning of objects but actually we are

01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:17.310
meaning of objects but actually we are
 

01:38:17.310 --> 01:38:19.310
meaning of objects but actually we are

01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320
supposed to demonstrate in public how
 

01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:21.440

objects can articulate ideas like

objects can articulate ideas like

objects can articulate ideas like
aspirations and so on so we sort of

aspirations and so on so we sort of
 

01:38:23.490 --> 01:38:25.220

01:39:16.590 --> 01:39:22.330
Michael Graves teapot I mean what a man
on the street is well that's true yeah

01:39:22.330 --> 01:39:22.340
 
 

01:39:22.340 --> 01:39:27.520
 
you know a community where is one of the

01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:27.530
you know a community where is one of the
 

01:39:27.530 --> 01:39:31.310
you know a community where is one of the
77,000 how is the stadium you should

01:39:31.310 --> 01:39:31.320
77,000 how is the stadium you should
 

01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:32.840
77,000 how is the stadium you should
have called me I was looking for

01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:32.850
have called me I was looking for
 

01:39:32.850 --> 01:39:35.690
have called me I was looking for
somebody to go anyway so what am i when

01:39:35.690 --> 01:39:35.700
somebody to go anyway so what am i when
 

01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:37.740
somebody to go anyway so what am i when
I went on to the question of

01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:37.750
I went on to the question of
 

01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:40.890
I went on to the question of
radical uber theoretical means somebody

01:39:40.890 --> 01:39:40.900
radical uber theoretical means somebody
 

01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:44.660
radical uber theoretical means somebody
says hey hey I'm theoretical which is

01:39:44.660 --> 01:39:44.670
says hey hey I'm theoretical which is
 

01:39:44.670 --> 01:39:48.630
says hey hey I'm theoretical which is
which is not a more theoretical act and

01:39:48.630 --> 01:39:48.640
which is not a more theoretical act and
 

01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:51.000
which is not a more theoretical act and
by the way the reverse is true somebody

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:51.010
by the way the reverse is true somebody
 

01:39:51.010 --> 01:39:53.790
by the way the reverse is true somebody
who says there's too much theory around

01:39:53.790 --> 01:39:53.800
who says there's too much theory around
 

01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:56.610
who says there's too much theory around
I don't want theory that's a theory

01:39:56.610 --> 01:39:56.620
I don't want theory that's a theory
 

01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:58.890
I don't want theory that's a theory
that's a theory so the anti theory

01:39:58.890 --> 01:39:58.900
that's a theory so the anti theory
 

01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:04.100
that's a theory so the anti theory
theory which is by the way all the rage

01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:04.110
 
 

01:40:04.110 --> 01:40:06.660
 
actually the anti series theory yeah

01:40:06.660 --> 01:40:06.670
actually the anti series theory yeah
 

01:40:06.670 --> 01:40:08.850
actually the anti series theory yeah
it's generally in the ascent and every

01:40:08.850 --> 01:40:08.860
it's generally in the ascent and every
 

01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:11.010
it's generally in the ascent and every
now and then has a dip down yeah and the

01:40:11.010 --> 01:40:11.020
now and then has a dip down yeah and the
 

01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:15.390
now and then has a dip down yeah and the
dip down people speak of the rise of

01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:15.400
dip down people speak of the rise of
 

01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:16.800
dip down people speak of the rise of
theory in the eighties I'm coming to

01:40:16.800 --> 01:40:16.810
theory in the eighties I'm coming to
 

01:40:16.810 --> 01:40:18.900
theory in the eighties I'm coming to
think now that it was the just a dip in

01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:18.910
think now that it was the just a dip in
 

01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:24.330
think now that it was the just a dip in
ante theory all right but I want to say

01:40:24.330 --> 01:40:24.340
ante theory all right but I want to say
 

01:40:24.340 --> 01:40:26.100
ante theory all right but I want to say
I think that I think your in your

01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:26.110
I think that I think your in your
 

01:40:26.110 --> 01:40:30.330
I think that I think your in your
analysis is good and an inaccurate and I

01:40:30.330 --> 01:40:30.340
analysis is good and an inaccurate and I
 

01:40:30.340 --> 01:40:34.140
analysis is good and an inaccurate and I
think that the the kind of Kitsch

01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:34.150
think that the the kind of Kitsch
 

01:40:34.150 --> 01:40:35.790
think that the the kind of Kitsch

that's mapping on reasonably well to

that's mapping on reasonably well to
this design and actually if you it's

01:40:42.210 --> 01:40:42.220
this design and actually if you it's
 

01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:44.400
this design and actually if you it's
it's it's written that way in the

01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:44.410
it's it's written that way in the
 

01:40:44.410 --> 01:40:46.680
it's it's written that way in the
greenberg argument but also your final

greenberg argument but also your final
 

01:40:46.690 --> 01:40:48.690

conclusion i think is totally super

01:40:48.690 --> 01:40:48.700
conclusion i think is totally super
 

01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:53.910
conclusion i think is totally super
accurate but i wouldn't necessarily

01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920

the case of Cornell this is they're not

01:41:04.530 --> 01:41:04.540
the case of Cornell this is they're not
 

01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:06.420
the case of Cornell this is they're not

they're seeking that relationship I

01:41:07.890 --> 01:41:07.900
they're seeking that relationship I
 

01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:10.290
they're seeking that relationship I

I leave behind the market in order to be

think but why so that when I go back
 

01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:15.890

into the market I don't go out as an

idiot right so basically the mechanism

01:42:18.770 --> 01:42:18.780
idiot right so basically the mechanism

of university is to create a withdrawal

01:42:20.689 --> 01:42:20.699
of university is to create a withdrawal
 

01:42:20.699 --> 01:42:23.540
of university is to create a withdrawal
from the market in order to engage more

01:42:23.540 --> 01:42:23.550
from the market in order to engage more
 

01:42:23.550 --> 01:42:25.550
from the market in order to engage more
intelligently with the market so the

01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560
intelligently with the market so the
 

01:42:25.560 --> 01:42:27.920
intelligently with the market so the
withdrawal is in the name of the market

01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:27.930
withdrawal is in the name of the market
 

01:42:27.930 --> 01:42:29.510
withdrawal is in the name of the market
it's not actually a kind of withdrawal

01:42:29.510 --> 01:42:29.520
it's not actually a kind of withdrawal
 

01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:32.479
it's not actually a kind of withdrawal
which is why somebody who graduates from

good students spend all this money to be

the school is not that interesting which
means schools have to be as interesting

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:47.610
means schools have to be as interesting
 

01:43:47.610 --> 01:43:49.970
means schools have to be as interesting
as they can in order that it's easier

01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:38.910
research universities in the world
 

01:47:38.910 --> 01:47:41.420
research universities in the world
should maintain a school of architecture

01:47:41.420 --> 01:47:41.430
should maintain a school of architecture
 

01:47:41.430 --> 01:47:43.400

under an engineering school there are a

under an engineering school there are a

lot of architecture schools that are

lot of architecture schools that are
within engineering schools and they make
