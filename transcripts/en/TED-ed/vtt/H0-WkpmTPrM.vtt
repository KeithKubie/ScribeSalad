00:00:09.205 --> 00:00:11.171
"Sorry, my phone died."

00:00:11.195 --> 00:00:13.471
"It's nothing. I'm fine."

00:00:13.495 --> 00:00:16.723
"These allegations
are completely unfounded."

00:00:16.747 --> 00:00:20.100
"The company was not aware
of any wrongdoing."

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.519
"I love you."

00:00:23.543 --> 00:00:26.387
We hear anywhere
from 10 to 200 lies a day,

00:00:26.411 --> 00:00:29.754
and we spent much of our history
coming up with ways to detect them,

00:00:29.778 --> 00:00:32.676
from medieval torture
devices to polygraphs,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.018
blood-pressure and breathing monitors,
voice-stress analyzers,

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:38.701
eye trackers, infrared brain scanners,

00:00:38.725 --> 00:00:41.907
and even the 400-pound
electroencephalogram.

00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:45.066
But although such tools have worked
under certain circumstances,

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.045
most can be fooled
with enough preparation,

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:52.097
and none are considered reliable enough
to even be admissible in court.

00:00:52.121 --> 00:00:54.641
But, what if the problem
is not with the techniques,

00:00:54.665 --> 00:00:59.042
but the underlying assumption
that lying spurs physiological changes?

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.047
What if we took a more direct approach,

00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:04.239
using communication science
to analyze the lies themselves?

00:01:05.146 --> 00:01:09.959
On a psychological level, we lie partly
to paint a better picture of ourselves,

00:01:09.983 --> 00:01:12.835
connecting our fantasies
to the person we wish we were

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:15.157
rather than the person we are.

00:01:15.181 --> 00:01:19.545
But while our brain is busy dreaming,
it's letting plenty of signals slip by.

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:23.704
Our conscious mind only controls
about 5% of our cognitive function,

00:01:23.728 --> 00:01:25.264
including communication,

00:01:25.288 --> 00:01:28.664
while the other 95% occurs
beyond our awareness,

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:31.850
and according to the literature
on reality monitoring,

00:01:31.874 --> 00:01:34.212
stories based on imagined experiences

00:01:34.236 --> 00:01:38.093
are qualitatively different
from those based on real experiences.

00:01:38.117 --> 00:01:42.119
This suggests that creating a false story
about a personal topic takes work

00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:45.036
and results in a different
pattern of language use.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.207
A technology known
as linguistic text analysis

00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:50.931
has helped to identify
four such common patterns

00:01:50.955 --> 00:01:53.161
in the subconscious language of deception.

00:01:54.153 --> 00:01:58.473
First, liars reference themselves less,
when making deceptive statements.

00:01:58.497 --> 00:02:02.224
They write or talk more about others,
often using the third person

00:02:02.248 --> 00:02:05.216
to distance and disassociate
themselves from their lie,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.134
which sounds more false:

00:02:07.158 --> 00:02:09.966
"Absolutely no party took
place at this house,"

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.845
or "I didn't host a party here."

00:02:13.178 --> 00:02:15.733
Second, liars tend to be more negative,

00:02:15.757 --> 00:02:19.238
because on a subconscious level,
they feel guilty about lying.

00:02:19.262 --> 00:02:21.398
For example, a liar
might say something like,

00:02:21.422 --> 00:02:25.589
"Sorry, my stupid phone battery died.
I hate that thing."

00:02:25.613 --> 00:02:28.853
Third, liars typically explain
events in simple terms

00:02:28.877 --> 00:02:31.976
since our brains struggle
to build a complex lie.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.305
Judgment and evaluation

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.159
are complex things
for our brains to compute.

00:02:36.183 --> 00:02:38.654
As a U.S. President once
famously insisted:

00:02:38.678 --> 00:02:41.766
"I did not have sexual relations
with that woman."

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.659
And finally, even though liars
keep descriptions simple,

00:02:44.683 --> 00:02:48.134
they tend to use longer
and more convoluted sentence structure,

00:02:48.158 --> 00:02:49.740
inserting unnecessary words

00:02:49.764 --> 00:02:53.476
and irrelevant but factual
sounding details in order to pad the lie.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.140
Another President confronted
with a scandal proclaimed:

00:02:56.164 --> 00:02:59.510
"I can say, categorically,
that this investigation indicates

00:02:59.534 --> 00:03:01.297
that no one on the White House staff,

00:03:01.321 --> 00:03:03.676
no one in this administration
presently employed

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.600
was involved
in this very bizarre incident."

00:03:06.624 --> 00:03:10.164
Let's apply linguistic analysis
to some famous examples.

00:03:10.188 --> 00:03:13.213
Take seven-time Tour de France
winner Lance Armstrong.

00:03:13.237 --> 00:03:15.373
When comparing a 2005 interview,

00:03:15.397 --> 00:03:18.250
in which he had denied taking
performance-enhancing drugs

00:03:18.274 --> 00:03:21.188
to a 2013 interview,
in which he admitted it,

00:03:21.212 --> 00:03:25.168
his use of personal pronouns
increased by nearly 3/4.

00:03:25.192 --> 00:03:27.835
Note the contrast
between the following two quotes.

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:32.146
First: "Okay, you know, a guy
in a French, in a Parisian laboratory

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.107
opens up your sample, you know,
Jean-Francis so-and-so, and he tests it.

00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:38.828
And then you get a phone call
from a newspaper that says:

00:03:38.853 --> 00:03:41.634
'We found you to be positive
six times for EPO."

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.004
Second: "I lost myself in all of that.

00:03:45.028 --> 00:03:47.923
I'm sure there would be other people
that couldn't handle it,

00:03:47.947 --> 00:03:49.704
but I certainly couldn't handle it,

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:52.726
and I was used to controlling
everything in my life.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.388
I controlled every outcome in my life."

00:03:55.412 --> 00:03:58.294
In his denial, Armstrong described
a hypothetical situation

00:03:58.318 --> 00:04:00.297
focused on someone else,

00:04:00.321 --> 00:04:02.979
removing himself
from the situation entirely.

00:04:03.003 --> 00:04:04.956
In his admission, he owns his statements,

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.585
delving into his personal emotions
and motivations.

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.552
But the use of personal pronouns
is just one indicator of deception.

00:04:12.576 --> 00:04:14.885
Let's look at another example
from former Senator

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:18.137
and U.S. Presidential candidate
John Edwards:

00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:20.740
"I only know that the apparent
father has said publicly

00:04:20.764 --> 00:04:22.654
that he is the father of the baby.

00:04:22.678 --> 00:04:25.690
I also have not been engaged
in any activity of any description

00:04:25.714 --> 00:04:29.148
that requested, agreed to,
or supported payments of any kind

00:04:29.172 --> 00:04:32.353
to the woman or to the apparent
father of the baby."

00:04:32.377 --> 00:04:36.396
Not only is that a pretty long-winded way
to say, "The baby isn't mine,"

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.306
but Edwards never calls
the other parties by name,

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.139
instead saying "that baby," "the woman,"
and "the apparent father."

00:04:43.163 --> 00:04:46.192
Now let's see what he had to say
when later admitting paternity:

00:04:46.216 --> 00:04:47.743
"I am Quinn's father.

00:04:47.767 --> 00:04:50.024
I will do everything
in my power to provide her

00:04:50.048 --> 00:04:52.141
with the love and support she deserves."

00:04:53.066 --> 00:04:54.744
The statement is short and direct,

00:04:54.768 --> 00:04:58.303
calling the child by name
and addressing his role in her life.

00:04:58.327 --> 00:05:01.534
So how can you apply these
lie-spotting techniques to your life?

00:05:01.558 --> 00:05:05.195
First, remember that many of the lies
we encounter on a daily basis

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:09.820
are far less serious that these examples,
and may even be harmless.

00:05:09.844 --> 00:05:12.504
But it's still worthwhile
to be aware of telltale clues,

00:05:12.528 --> 00:05:16.216
like minimal self-references,
negative language,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.643
simple explanations
and convoluted phrasing.

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:22.819
It just might help you avoid
an overvalued stock,

00:05:22.843 --> 00:05:25.758
an ineffective product,
or even a terrible relationship.
