this video was sponsored by

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:05.600
Casper.com, the company that made my mattress. The one that my wife and I have been using for the last two and a half years

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.100
I've put a link down in the description so you can get one of these super comfortable mattresses for yourself

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.740
And if you check out what the promo code the king of random you'll slash another fifty dollars off the price

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:16.980
Hey, what's up guys! welcome back to the lab!

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.230
I've got a very exciting DIY project for you today,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.369
Because I'm going to show you how to dig down into the depths of the earth and make your own clay.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.940
Now this project here was inspired a couple of years ago when I stumbled across a channel called Primitive

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.820
Technology. all about a guy in Australia who goes out into the woods and uses nothing

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.780
But the materials around him to build cool things like houses

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.840
Looms and even metal foundries and the basis for all of his experiments involved clay so a couple years ago

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.020
This really got me thinking if we were stranded out in the middle of nowhere. What exactly would it

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.560
Take to make some good clay that's exactly what we're exploring in this video today

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.120
Now to gather up the materials for this experiment today

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.090
I just went down to the local River and walk down beside the riverbed

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.590
I found a nice little place under the bridge where there's a lot of traffic

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.669
 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.799
Took a second to enjoy the scenery and then started digging down into the dirt as close to the water as I felt comfortable

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.338
now the reason I went for dirt by the Riverbed is because clay is sedimentary which means it flows down to the lowest point and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.740
Well, I actually have extracted clay from dirt from my backyard

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.340
I find

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.420
It's much better down by the river so take a trip down your local river grab some dirt

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.070
And you want to be looking for the dirt that when you squish it kind of has that plastic you feel it sticks together

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.680
Into one big clump, you can find something like that. You're well on your way to making clay so here

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.069
We are guys we've got a nice little amount of dirt here and the first thing we notice about it

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.409
Is it's not very clean. There's all kinds of rocks

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.859
There's sand there's little sticks and twigs this stuff is very very dirty and even though you can squish it and turn it into different

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:38.380
shapes

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.649
It's not super clean you can see all the organics and those large chunks of rocks sticking through

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.229
So to actually extract the clay out of this dirty mixture

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.188
we're going to need to put it through a very very simple process and the only thing is we're going to make that happen or

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.189
A couple of different containers and a little bit of water

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.310
So quick update guys you can see that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.780
I just added a little bit of water to this mixture

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.119
And I use my glove just reach down there and stir it around

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.770
What we're actually doing is we're breaking up all the different pieces in the dirt itself. We've got rocks

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:22.219
We've got sand we've got clay we've got organic materials and what happens is as we mix it with water they separate their different layers

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.749
Now over time the clay and send all settle to the bottom so we want to do is stir this vigorously

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.210
I'll get everything suspended and then give it about five

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.740
Seconds to settle and then transfer all the liquid into a separate container watch what happens when I do

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.670
Sweet now if we stop pouring right here

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.470
You can see most of the heavy stuff is left. Behind if we look down the bucket. You can see gravel rocks everything

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.899
That's heavy
you can even see a bit of sand left here on the bottom of the bucket so we can essentially take this stuff and we

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.620
Can throw it away because we're not going to need these big rocks for after now is all the stuff

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.459
That's contained in this liquid here now the second pass is Gonna be a little bit different

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.449
We need something like a strainer you could use your shirt you can use your socks or in this case

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.040
I'm just going to use a strainer for convenience

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.599
We're going to go ahead and clean out this container

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.429
Then we're gonna pour all this liquid through the strainer back into it and hopefully that will remove most of the organic material

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.709
Almost looks like concrete gravel

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.030
very cool

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.030
So I've washed and clean out this way bucket

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.419
We got our little strainer here as I said you can use your shirt or any kind of cloth material

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.549
We're just trying to strain out those organics, but remember that before we pour this solution through the strainer

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:44.959
It's very important to stir it up and agitate it so all those clay particles resuspend in the water once again

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.490
So you can see once we strained everything out

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.589
We've got quite a bit of organic material left behind we've got sticks leaves twigs anything that what's floating to the surface

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.180
and if you want to be extra cautious

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.079
You can go ahead and clean out your strainer and filter it one more time to catch anything you might miss

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.310
oh

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.170
Starting to look a little like chocolate milk

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.020
What's interesting about this is every time we pour it back and forth you notice

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.960
there's some kind of a

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.530
standing residue left behind that's because the sand is actually heavier than the clay and sinks down to the bottom is reporting it, so

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.600
theoretically now if we take two containers

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.900
And we simply transfer it back and forth and clean the stand out every time

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.550
Eventually most of that sand is going to be reduced. We're going to have a very fine clay. So here. We are guys

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.020
What we've got now is a bucket full of clay water essentially they had a little bit of sand we have

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.919
Used gravity and density of the materials inside to filter out the rocks

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.990
We've used a strainer to filter off most of the organic materials and so now we just have a solution of clay suspended in water

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:11.729
And the longer we let this sit the more of that sand and clay will drop down to the bottom now

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.350
We don't want the clay to actually settle down yet

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.689
We want to extract that first so I'm going to do now is use these two containers to cycle them back and forth and extract

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.350
the layers of Sand each time we do and

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.770
While they're doing that it's a good time to drop down to the description and click the link to check out Castro mattresses my wife

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.340
And I have been using our cast for mattress for over 2 and a half years now and to date

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.990
It is still the most comfortable mattress

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.540
We've ever used

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:37.080
so here's the deal while dirt rocks and clay are pretty cool to play with they're not super comfortable to sleep on and if you

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.620
Do some quick math you'll realize about a third of your life is spent in bed sleeping

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.879
Some people even more than that so treat your body right and get your sleep in comfort

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.890
It's a very worthy investment

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.410

And if you live in the us or Canada they'll ship it to your house for free

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:19.200
It shows up at your door in a very small box that'll make you wonder how they even got it in there

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.319
I just stripped all the sheets off the bed, so you can see after two and a half years

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.320
This is still the mattress that we're using it is a really comfortable mattress

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.360
It's very enjoyable to sleep on it's firm

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:32.579
But soft enough to get good sleep and for some reason whenever I sleep at somebody else's house or go to a hotel I seem

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.330
To get back aches and a little bit of a headache that never happens with my casper mattress

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.040
I also like to sleep a bit cooler at night

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.300
I don't like to sleep in a sweat

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.419
And this mattress is breathable which helps prevent that from happening

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:48.808
Kasper understands the importance of really loving your mattress before you fully commit to it and by using the internet they cut out the expensive

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:55.018
retailers
and pass the savings on to you their in-house team of engineers have spent thousands of hours developing the casper to the point where it's

00:06:55.019 --> 00:06:58.229
Considered obsessively engineered, and that's paid off because after over

00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:01.139
25,000 reviews it's got a rating of 4.9 stars

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:03.539
It's quickly becoming the inTernet's favorite mattress

00:07:03.999 --> 00:07:09.988
casper's design developed and assembled in the Usa and uses a combination of supportive memory foam that give it just the right sink in just

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:11.579
the Right Bounce plus

So make sure you absolutely love it, and if you don't they'll come pick it up and give you all your money back

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:27.088
So treat your body right and invest in a casper mattress today

00:07:27.089 --> 00:07:33.148
You've got nothing to lose and a lifetime of better sleeps to gain the link is in the description and with that said let's get

00:07:33.149 --> 00:07:35.149
back to making our clay

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:51.639
there we have a guys I poured this back and forth about four times taking out a little bit of fine sand each time we

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:54.158
Do now we can continue this process almost indefinitely

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.599
We're just at this point getting out some of that really fine silt, but right here

00:07:58.599 --> 00:08:00.550
We have relatively clear relatively fine

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.509
Clay water and the only thing we really need to do with this now is set it down on a counter where it won't be

00:08:04.509 --> 00:08:08.679
Disturbed for about an hour to give the layers a chance to separate just for fun

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.079
We had some leftover water, so I transfer that into another container

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.580
I'm just going to set these down right here, so we can watch them over a period of time and see how they settle

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:29.139
Quick update guys we've let this sit for about five hours now. You can see the clay is so fine

00:08:29.139 --> 00:08:34.299
That's actually taking quite a bit of time for the water to rise up even to this level now if we let this sit for

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:39.190
Maybe a day or so, I'm sure that clay would compact even more we have more water on top however

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.219
There's a quicker way to extract water than that now the first thing

00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:46.148
We need to do is get this water that we have on top off of the top and there's a few ways we can do

00:08:46.149 --> 00:08:51.189
That we can simply tip it over and pour it out or we can use something like a siphon to try and suck it out

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.560
Now either option is going to have its pros and it's cons

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.539
But ultimately all we want to do is make sure we get this clay here without any of this stuff here

00:08:58.699 --> 00:09:01.239
So first things first, I'm just going to take this tall glass here

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.219
We're going to just tip this over very slowly very carefully to get as much of that water off the top as we can

00:09:19.819 --> 00:09:24.009
I'm just going to pour off the top layer that clay as well just to extract most of that water

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:26.679
And we'll call that right there pretty good

00:09:27.319 --> 00:09:30.759
Most of that is going to be really fine clay. We can see it's very very moist

00:09:30.759 --> 00:09:32.979
So we need to clean that up with a towel

00:09:33.559 --> 00:09:38.859
Now the second method of extracting this water is siphoning it we can use this to suck the fluid up over here

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:44.349
But before it hits our mouth we can dump it over here and gravity will suck it everything out very similar to a vacuum cleaner

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:03.850
now to get even more of the moisture out of our clay we want to use something like a towel or a shirt something that's

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:06.759
Very tight-knit and has a lot of fibers in this case. I'm going to take this towel

00:10:06.759 --> 00:10:08.769
I'm going to double it over on itself

00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:14.589
we almost want to make a piece of fabric that the clay will not go through we want all of it to stay inside if

00:10:14.589 --> 00:10:16.688
Possible so got a little makeshift filter here

00:10:16.689 --> 00:10:18.370
We're going to pour these in hopefully

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:21.699
It's tight enough that will hold the clay inside so we can tie it up into a little ball

00:10:21.699 --> 00:10:23.209
we can hang it up and let the

00:10:23.209 --> 00:10:27.279
Atmosphere suck the moisture out of it for a few hours until we're just left with the clay itself

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.800
You can see this towel once

00:10:30.199 --> 00:10:31.459
It's sucked down

00:10:31.459 --> 00:10:35.828
but we don't want it to and hopefully this is thick enough that it's not actually going to

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:41.259
Go through the towel itself. We want to be able to pick this up and to be very little if anything

00:10:41.899 --> 00:10:43.269
Coming through the bottom of the bucket

00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:48.909
we want it to all stand side so it's looking pretty good so far might even want to clamp that down obviously in the

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:52.268
Wild in nature you wouldn't have clamps, but you can improvise us something else

00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:56.558
We just don't want the towel to actually suck down into the bucket here. We go with the round two

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.220
Starting to get heavy now

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.349
Beautiful there we go. There's all our clay in our towel

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.530
And we're just going to fold this up tie it off and hang it for a bit

00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:17.500
Now if everything goes well, we want to take all the edges of this towel fold them all together

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:24.129
And make a nice little ball of liquid look. I just fill in. It's okay. We can save it

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.950
There we go. It's looking very good very good

00:11:40.569 --> 00:11:45.029
All right, so we got our slipknot set and now all I have to do is shake it. Shake it. Shake. Shake it shake it

00:11:45.879 --> 00:11:48.029
Doesn't have to be clean this has to be functional

00:11:49.659 --> 00:11:51.659
There, what do you think?

00:11:51.699 --> 00:11:54.598
All right, so this is pretty much what we're going for guys

00:11:54.599 --> 00:11:57.899
We got our clay wrapped up inside the towel, and you can see some moisture dripping off

00:11:57.909 --> 00:12:00.718
But a lot of that is relatively clean water

00:12:00.719 --> 00:12:05.129
It doesn't have the clay in it because the clay is being trapped by the fibers on the inside of cloth

00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:08.908
Now if we just let this hang out for a couple of hours most that moisture is going to come out

00:12:08.909 --> 00:12:10.979
We should be left with a nice ball of clay

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:29.560
Alright guys. We are back

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:33.420
It's been about an hour now since we took our bag outside and let it hang off of the railing

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:34.860
now in the interest of time

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.360
I actually did squeeze the bag a little bit to help encourage a little bit of that moisture to come out a little bit quicker

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:44.100
In doing so I sacrificed a little bit of the clay itself, but I don't think that's going to jeopardize the proof-of-concept

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:49.439
so here we are with our towel with most of the water squeezed out of it if we open up something now and take a

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.410
Look inside

00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:53.910
You can see a lot of the clay on the upper Edges has started to harden up

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:58.319
And it's very plastic the stuff on the inside though is still really liquidy. It's kind of like runny

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:03.209
Diarrhea if we left this out exposed to the air eventually that moisture would evaporate and the clay would become hard

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.070
However, there is a way. We can speed things up

00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:07.350
There's a way we can cheat and all we need is a little bit of paper towel

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:11.429
All we're going to do is rip off a few sheets of paper towel fold it in half I'm going to stick it down on

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.450
The table like this then we're going to scoop up our clay put it down the center of our paper towel

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.080
And we're basically just going to flatten it out

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.449
The paper towel is going to absorb a lot of the moisture out of the clay and as soon as it reaches the consistency

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:27.029
We're looking for we can peel off the paper towel and wrap our clay in Saran wrap or plastic bag for later use

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:28.080
now again

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.229
If you don't have a paper towel all you have to do is just let this sit out in the open air a little bit

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:36.450
Longer and let it evaporate on its own, but we're just using this technique to speed the process up a bit

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.490
I'm just going to take a couple more sheets of paper towel

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:42.299
Lay them over top and help flatten it out from the top side

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:47.580
To help absorb the moisture a little bit quicker from up here as well, and now as easy as that

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:53.520
Oh, wow. I love this part peel this back and take a look at this we have some very nice

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:55.780
beautiful

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.920
ready-to-Use clay it just sealed off and

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.920
Mold in the palm of your hand that

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:09.509
Is amazing this stuff is very moldable. It's very easy to work with very plastic

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:15.210
You could use this to make a little bowl a little pot a little dish pretty much anything you want if you have a countertop

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:19.530
With a smooth surface you can go ahead and throw it down in the countertop and just work it around a little bit

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.069
Help work out any of the bubbles the cracks the crevices and things of that nature

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.320
Now if your clay gets a little bit, too

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.489
dry you can add a little bit more water in to work it around to make a little more plastic in the other hand if

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:33.960
it's too wet you can just let it stand out in the open air for a couple hours to let it evaporate and

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.410
Harden up by itself now before we did this experiment today?

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:37.910
I went down to the river and I got a lot more of this river mud

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:38.410
 

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.029
 

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:42.910
And I let it stand in Five-gallon buckets over a period of three days

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.910
And I turned it into this now this piece of clay

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:47.380
I worked back and forth a little bit more

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.510
I got more of the sand out and I let it sit overnight

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:53.830
Until all the water had come to the top made a little bit easier to work with and you can feel

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:57.309
If you just run your finger along the side of this it almost feels rubbery

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:01.809
It's got a very plastic texture to it if we carve into it with something like a fork or a spoon

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.140
You can see how it just peels away now

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:07.449
You can work this you can roll it you can use it to make pottery

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:13.749
dishes pretty much anything you want if you were to fire this in an oven or a kiln the right temperature you turn it into

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:17.830
Pottery like a Terracotta planter pot and possibly even ceramic

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:24.309
So here you have it guys we have successfully turned river mud into blocks of clay that we can now use turn into pottery

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:30.010
Earthenware and possibly fire into ceramic all things we're going to try to do in future project videos

00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:32.410
Let's quickly Recap. How we got here

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:37.479
We started this project this morning by going down to the river and pulling dirt and rocks straight out of the Riverbank?

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.800
We brought the dirt home

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.520
We stuck it in a bucket of water, and we swirled it around until everything was broken up

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:47.319
Then we let it sit for a few seconds and poured all that dirty water into a second container our first

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:53.290
Observation was that everything heavy was left behind all the rocks the pebbles and most of the heavy sand next we grabbed a strainer

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:57.909
We poured all the water through that to help pull off any organic materials like leaves sticks or anything floating on the top

00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.779
Which in a survival situation would also work with a piece of clothing like your shirt?

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:03.790
We transferred the water back and forth a few times

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:08.830
Trying to get out as much of the sentence we could and we're left with a very dirty grey water, which we eventually

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:10.220
Transferred into a towel

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:15.040
Pulled up at all four ends to form a ball then tied off with a piece of string and let hang on the railing we

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:19.839
Let it sit outside for about an hour then we squeeze the bag to help get rid of any excess moisture where we brought inside

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:23.169
Open up the towel and saw that we had a very slushy clay

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.410
We transferred that clay to a paper towel to absorb even more moisture

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.630
Scraped it off and ended up with this a nice ball of clay that we can turn into anything we want

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:36.340
So there you have it guys that is how you go down to the river take the mud and turn it into a fairly

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.960
Processed clay at home what we end up doing with this stuff is completely up to you

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:45.729
So let me know what you want to see down in the comments below. Thanks for joining us for this experiment today

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.730
We'll be looking for you the next one Doc you then?

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:52.780

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:09.249
It makes a pretty nice moldable clay as easy as that it really does look like chocolate milk

00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:15.489
And clay is not really that bad for your diet. No. It's really really bad. Don't drink it you can put it on your face
