00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.200
Hi I’m John Green, this is CrashCourse Literature
and today we’re going to talk about the

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.970
greatest Dane of all, Scooby-Doo. No, it’s
Hamlet.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.430
So Hamlet is either a 16h or 17th century
play, we’re not positive. The Tragedy of

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.739
Hamlet, Prince of Denmark was written by William
Shakespeare sometime between 1599 and 1602

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:21.659
and it’s considered by many to be Shakespeare’s
best work, even better than Timon of Athens

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:23.819
or Cymbeline.
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, I know Hamlet’s like

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:27.199
super famous and important and everything,
but isn’t it basically just like a super

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.619
long play about a guy who never makes up his
mind?

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.020
Well, Me From The Past, some argue that Hamlet
doesn’t have trouble making up his mind

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.070
so much as he has trouble executing his vision.
More specifically, executing his uncle.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.920
Then again, Me From The Past, many of us would
argue that Hamlet does struggle to make decisions,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.280
but the decisions he has to make are quite
difficult. I mean this is a play about justice

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.530
and revenge and your conscience, and your
place in the social order, and once again

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.130
deeply uncomfortable feelings about mothers.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:01:01.960
[Theme Music]

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.479
So, Shakespeare based Hamlet on a medieval
Scandinavian tale chronicled by everyone’s

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.100
favorite Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus,
pictured here, depending on your world view

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.350
as either Santa Claus or God.
But shakespeare probably knew the tale from

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.850
contemporary plays rather than like actual
Danish history because up to that point had

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.910
been mostly about Vikings and pastries. Actually,
that’s still mostly what it is.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:27.400
So Saxo tells the story of Prince Amleth,
a kid who he sees his uncle murder his father.

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.479
And then young Amleth bides his time and pretends
to be crazy in order to lull his uncle into

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.819
a false sense of security. And then, as soon
as he’s grown up, Amleth slaughters his

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.499
uncle with his father’s sword.
Amleth by the way, 80% of the way to being

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.200
Pig Latin for Hamlet.
Anyway, it’s interesting to know that background

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.719
because it makes you think about the changes
that Shakespeare makes to that story which

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:51.119
indicates something about what’s really
important to Shakespeare.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.780
For instance, Hamlet isn’t unable to kill
his uncle because he’s young. And he doesn’t

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.300
actually see his uncle murder his father.
So basically, Shakespeare was introducing

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.360
ambiguity into the story which is kind of
Shakespeare’s specialty.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.060
So Hamlet is Shakespeare’s most popular
play, in fact, it’s perhaps the only one

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.920
to have been consistently performed since
it debuted. It’s also, very long.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.720
Like when Kenneth Branagh attempted to film
every line the movie lasted more than four

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.470
hours. Some theatrical productions have gone
on as long as six.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.110
The general consensus is that Shakespeare
wrote the play so long to satisfy himself,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.070
and he knew that theatre troupes would just
like make it shorter any way they wanted.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.920
But it’s also possible that he thought that
by keeping the audience at the theater for

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.870
longer, would help him to sell more
mutton pies at the concession stand.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.120
We have to remember art is also commerce.
But this whole link thing brings us to the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.090
fact that there are actually three different
versions of Hamlet. There are two quartos,

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.560
one from 1603 and another from 1604, and then
the Folio edition from 1623

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.830
The second quarto and the folio are somewhat
similar, although the first was probably based

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.460
on Shakespeare’s notes and the second based
on seeing the play in performance.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.650
But the first quarto is known as the “bad
quarto,” and not in the sense that it’s

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.950
evil, but in the sense that it’s kind of
terrible.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.300
Historians believe that an actor probably
transcribed the first quarto his memory and

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.860
that that actor probably only played really
small parts. Like Marcellus.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.620
Basically, the scenes he was onstage for he remembered pretty well, but the other ones not so much.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.940
He was probably that actor who's always
mouthing other peoples' lines. For example,

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:27.720
here’s the bad quarto’s  “To be or not to be” speech:
“To be, or not to be, that's the point,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.280
to die, to sleepe, is that all?” Yeah, that's fantastic.
Anyway, in all the versions, the plot is the same:

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.020
Hamlet is a grad student who returns
home to Elsinore when his father dies and

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.170
then his mother Gertrude suddenly marries
his uncle Claudius. Claudius takes over as

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.760
king even though technically Hamlet should
inherit the throne.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.850
So a grieving Hamlet deals with this as any
grad student would by wearing black, listening

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.380
to sad music, and making long speeches about
how he wishes his flesh would melt. Which

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.430
spoiler: It eventually will.
But then, his father’s ghost appears to

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.600
him and begs Hamlet to revenge his murder
by that aforementioned uncle Claudius. Hamlet

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.330
isn’t sure about this. So he pretends to
be insane, you know as you do.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.550
He then hires a troupe of players
to put on a show that will make Claudius to

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.319
reveal his guilt,
Claudius is indeed overwhelmed with emotion,

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.840
flees the play, Gertrude summons Hamlet to
her bedchamber where they have a weirdly intimate

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.280
discussion, until Hamlet hears a noise and
in a rare decisive moment stabs the curtain.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.770
Oh, but it’s not my uncle, it’s Polonius.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.720
Polonius, who was never brief despite saying
that, “brevity is the soul of wit.”

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.510
And then also famously said, “to thine own
self be true” and you know, proceeded to

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.220
not be terribly true to himself.
So Gertrude decides that Hamlet should get

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.300
out of town for a while and he sails away
and there’s a writ of death and storms and

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:47.720
pirates, and then Hamlet returns only to find
that Polonius’s daughter Ophelia has committed

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.160
suicide and that her brother Laertes is kind
of mad at Hamlet.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.639
So Claudius schedules a fencing match between
Laertes and Hamlet, poisoning Laertes’s

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.660
sword and Hamlet’s wine.
Hamlet is stabbed, but manages to wound Laertes

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:07.430
while Gertrude downs the fatal wine. And then,
once everyone is dead or dying Hamlet decides

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.430
that, now, is finally a good time to stab
Claudius.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.300
Basically, all the Danes die. Except Horatio
of course because you need someone to say,

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.960
“Good night sweet prince: And flights of
angels sing thee to thy rest!”

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.340
What kind of place is this Denmark where people
have stunningly un-Danish names like Claudius

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.710
and Polonius. Well, let’s go to the Thought
Bubble.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:31.560
So, throughout the play, Claudius is building
up an army to take on Norway and Denmark is

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.580
caught in a strange limbo between war and
not war. As often happens, the specter of

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:41.230
external enemies leads the ruling powers to
search for enemies within, and we see a lot

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.990
of examples of Elsinore as a surveillance
society. Like, Hamlet’s not wrong when he

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:49.700
tells Rosencrantz and Guildenstern “Denmark’s
a prison.”

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.310
The characters are closely watching each other;
I mean Gertrude and Claudius are watching

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.990
Hamlet, so is Polonius, though he’s awfully
bad at it. Hamlet’s schoolmates, Rosencrantz

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.560
and Guildenstern are watching him closely
as Claudius is encouraging them to spy while

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.050
they throw back Danish grog and talk about
girls. Ophelia is watching Hamlet, too, but

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.139
Hamlet isn’t watching her, because he’s
too busy staring at Claudius, trying to figure

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.000
out if he really did murder his father and
of course Hamlet also spends a lot of time

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.620
watching himself and then reciting anguished
soliloquies about it.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.620
Personally, in the end, I’m more struck
my Hamlet’s narcissism than by his indecisiveness.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.540
Anyway, all of this is probably less a criticism

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.340
of Denmark, which is a perfectly nice place
full of herring sandwiches and competitive

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.320
handball, than it is a commentary on Elizabethan
England, a place notorious for spying and

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.020
also the place where Shakespeare actually
lived. There were all sorts of anti-royal,

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:43.980
anti-Catholic conspiracies going and Elizabeth
I ran a whole network of spies to help discover

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:49.160
them — sort of like M in James Bond, but with
more tiaras. Even Christopher Marlowe, Shakespeare’s

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.940
rival and one of the most badass playwright’s
ever, was a spy. So the court of Elsinore

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.110
can be read as a commentary on Shakespeare’s
own environment, in which being tried and

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:00.479
beheaded for secret treason was kind of a
national pastime.

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:04.250
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So Hamlet is a play
about watching and being watched. Something

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.490
that we’re all pretty familiar with these
days, but it’s also a play about doubling

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.860
and mirroring.
This is a common Shakespearian thing but it

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.650
gets to some really core questions about being
a person.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:16.810
Like are people really capable of change,
can they become different people over time,

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.440
and when you look in the mirror are you seeing
the person that is actually you? Are you the

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.510
person you imagine yourself to be?
So, there are at least two Hamlets in this

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.600
play, right, there is the old dead King Hamlet
who goes around haunting the Elsinore battlements

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.320
and our hero who is supposed to avenge that
old Hamlet .

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.380
But the living Hamlet is also split into two
people: the one who wants to kill Claudius

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.900
and the one who’s like, “You know maybe
not. Maybe I should just be a grad student.”

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:44.740
And some critics argue that the Hamlet who
returns home from the pirate adventure is

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.050
yet another person, because he is a very different
guy from the one who left.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:53.680
And you can even see Ophelia as a kind of
extreme, subversive double for Hamlet, like

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:58.160
what Hamlet might be like if he were robbed
of all of his power and agency.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.540
And then obviously when the actors perform
their play The Murder of Gonzago, they’re

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:05.460
mirroring all the recent events in Elsinore.
But it’s not a regular mirror right. It’s

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:08.949
kind of a funhouse mirror.
But ultimately, it’s not just…. oh no!

00:08:08.949 --> 00:08:11.780
My desk is moving! That must mean it’s time
for the open letter!

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:17.110
An open letter to Simba. Hey there Simba,
let’s take a look at the 1990s adaptation

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:21.530
of Hamlet that DIDN’T star Mel Gibson. The
one starring you - The Lion King.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.430
Simba? Hamlet
Mufasa? Recently murdered king.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.190
Scar? Claudius
Mufasa in the sky and smoke? Oviously, Ghost.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:31.200
Nala? Ophelia
The Elephant Graveyard? England. Or maybe

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:34.370
the actual graveyard with the last poor Yorick
whom I knew well.

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:39.530
The point is: YOU MUST NEVER GO THERE, SIMBA.
Sorry, I don’t have a good James Earl Jones.

00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:42.719
Best wishes, John Green.
So anyway, it’s not just one mirror, but

00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:48.339
many, that reflect Hamlet’s trouble figuring
out what kind of a man he is and how he should act.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:53.440
These mirrors also underscore the perpetual
cycle of violence at the heart of the revenge

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.529
tragedy which you’ll no doubt remember from
our talk of ancient Greek stories.

00:08:56.529 --> 00:08:59.450
Like in these tragedies the desire for vengeance

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:05.200
ultimately corrupts the revenger and he or
she has to die, too. Each murder has to be

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.540
answered for with another murder until we
are out of people who can die.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.870
A good example of this unending violence is
old Hamlet’s ghost, who can’t rest in

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:18.529
this grave until he’s avenged. Now, the
critics Andrew Bennett and Nicholas Royle

00:09:18.529 --> 00:09:24.420
describe ghosts as “the very embodiment
of strange repetition or recurrence: it is

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:29.450
a revenant, it comes back”
Okay, but it comes back from where? Like ghosts

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:35.089
don’t really fit into Hamlet’s understanding
of death. He describes death as “The undiscover’d

00:09:35.089 --> 00:09:40.790
country, from whose born / No traveller returns.”
Except his dad, apparently.

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:44.810
In fact, one way to read it is that the ghost’s
fate is in some ways aligned with Catholic

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:50.640
purgatory, “confin’d to fast in fires
/ till the foul crimes done in my days of

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:57.060
nature / are burnt and purg’d away.” And
Hamlet seems to fear something similar, “For

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:01.920
in that sleep of death what dreams may come.”
Though it’s also worth nothing that Hamlet

00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:07.080
wonders if the ghost really is his father.
Hamlet has to ask if the ghost is a “spirit

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:11.490
of health or goblin damn'd.”
Regardless, the ghost makes Hamlet wonder

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:15.970
about the consequences of his actions. I mean
here’s Hamlet saying, “Can this ghost

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:22.100
(whose name I remind you is Hamlet) be trusted?
Is justice the business of people or of God.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.510
Now obviously there are no easy answers to
those questions but earthly justice is clearly

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:31.590
corrupt in this play — I mean Claudius has usurped
the kingdom and there’s evidence that old King

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:34.160
Hamlet might not have been the greatest ruler
either.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.240
And Claudius is already being punished spiritually,
although it’s not clear whether it comes

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:43.580
from himself or from god, but, like, at one point
he tries to pray and finds that he actually can’t:

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:49.820
“My words fly up, my thoughts remain below
words without thought never to heaven go,”

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.140
Now prayer was seen as cleansing and in that

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:57.220
scene Hamlet decides not to kill Claudius
because he believes that Claudius is praying

00:10:57.220 --> 00:11:01.440
and therefore will be cleansed of his sin
and will go straight to heaven if Hamlet killed

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.330
him right then.
And that wouldn’t be fair! Of course, actually,

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:09.029
if he’d just killed Claudius in that moment
due to the thoughts not going up to heaven

00:11:09.029 --> 00:11:13.100
everything would’ve been fine. I mean not
for Claudius, but you know, for justice.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:17.910
So should Hamlet act? Should he let diving
justice take its course? Does divine justice

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:22.380
only work through people? Even I can’t decide!
But Mr Green, Mr Green, in the end how does

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.870
Hamlet make up his mind though?
Well, Me From the Past, when he finally makes

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:29.670
up his mind he’s dieing, right? He has like
seconds left to live.

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:34.380
Ultimately, Hamlet is a great play for its
aphorisms, and its language, and its ambiguity,

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:40.340
but also because it brilliantly captures the
fact that we do not know what we are doing.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.860
Hamlet doesn’t struggle to decide a course
of action because he’s young or because

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:48.020
he’s an academic or because he’s a narcissist.
He struggles because he’s human.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.760
We’ll continue our discussion of him and the play
next week. Thanks for watching. I’ll see you then.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.959
