00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.540
There are two parameters associated with a normal

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.730
distribution. The mean, mu, and the standard deviation, sigma.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.523
These two parameters plug in to the following probability

00:00:10.523 --> 00:00:14.160
density function, which describes a Gaussian distribution. The expected

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.670
value of a variable described by a Gaussian

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.110
distribution is the mean, mu, and the variance is

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.690
the standard deviation, sigma squared. Normal distributions are also

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.600
symmetric about their mean. If you've taken an introduction

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.440
to stats course, the normal distribution should be a familiar tool.
