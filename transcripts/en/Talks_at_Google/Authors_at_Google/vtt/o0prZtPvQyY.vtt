00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.730
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Please join
me in welcoming Sal Scognamillo.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:04.860
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Thank you.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.740
Very happy to be here.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:06.890
Thank you so much, Michael.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.960
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: And
hopefully, a few of you

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.050
had the opportunity
to check out-- there

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:14.160
were some food
items that were made

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.580
in the One cafe, some escarole,
zucchini, broccoli rabe,

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.291
some pasta-- chi chi?

00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:22.540
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Chi chi, yes.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:23.230
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN:
I'm not Italian--

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:23.360
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Chickpeas.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.490
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: I'm
trying to learn Italian.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.085
Zucchini pie.

00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:26.960
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Yes.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.880
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Any
of those your favorites?

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.630
SAL SCOGNAMILLO:
I love all that.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.171
Zucchini is one of
my favorites, too,

00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:34.320
either the pie or the scapesce
style, very, very tasty.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.590
Something different, and
it's all grandpa's recipes,

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.090
you know.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.496
And him and my grandmother
started this restaurant.

00:00:39.496 --> 00:00:41.120
I don't know how they
had the fortitude

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.672
in the middle of World War II.

00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:43.760
They were doing this.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.450
And it's just amazing because
they did the hard work.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.300
And then I really just have
to keep the car on the road,

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.540
so to speak.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.980
And I also want to thank Google
for having me here today.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.740
This is wonderful.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.410
I'm very, very honored
to be with them.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.180
And thank you for
interviewing me as well.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.295
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Absolutely.

00:01:00.295 --> 00:01:02.790
You know, Patsy's
is associated with,

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.630
as I said, many celebrities
who continue to go and enjoy

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.380
the food to this day.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.800
Probably one of the most
legendary celebrities

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.240
that Patsy's is known as
having the honor to serve

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.390
is a gentleman
named Frank Sinatra.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.450
And, you know, there's a
really great video clip.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.450
Sal has put up a few
video clips on YouTube.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.481
And I wanted to
share this before we

00:01:23.481 --> 00:01:24.730
talk a little bit about Frank.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.480
But there's a clip of Sal
telling the story on YouTube

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.850
about how he first met
Frank Sinatra when he was

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.250
a little boy at the restaurant.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.530
So why don't we
play that, and then

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.856
we can talk a little bit about
Frank and other celebrities?

00:01:36.856 --> 00:01:37.610
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.442
-And he says, hey-- hey, Sal,
you want to meet Frank Sinatra?

00:01:40.442 --> 00:01:41.150
I'm 13 years old.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.690
I said, OK, no problem.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.050
And my job was to get him in.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.350
He had a secret entrance here.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.040
I had to get him
in the side door

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.220
and bring him up to the second
floor dining room, an entrance

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.944
to come in here.

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.860
We'd put him in this
room, close the curtains.

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.390
No one knew he was here.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.670
And I had the key to the door.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.044
And I can remember
it to this day

00:01:57.044 --> 00:01:59.590
because I didn't sleep
for two days afterwards.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.335
I was trying to get
that key in the door.

00:02:01.335 --> 00:02:01.960
I was jiggling.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.240
I was so nervous, so
nervous, because he

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.370
wanted to shake my hand.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.120
He says, hey, kid.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.880
How are you?

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.780
You're Joe's son.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.677
And all I had was
one thing on mind.

00:02:09.677 --> 00:02:12.260
I want to get him in the door,
make sure I don't screw this up

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.590
for my family.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.820
And I finally did,
and it was fun.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.750
And he shook my hand.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.910
It was a lot of laughs.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.660
And then, the first
time I cooked for him,

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.200
I was about 22 years old.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.170
My father was in the
dining room with him.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.730
My father had a suit on.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.430
My father was a chef before me.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.110
So Sinatra says to
my dad, he says,

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.780
Joe, what are you
doing with a suit?

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.780
You've got to go in the
kitchen and cook for me.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.685
He says, no, my kid
Sal took over that.

00:02:34.685 --> 00:02:36.920
He says, let me go see him.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.090
I'm in the kitchen here,
minding my own business.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.970
The door swings open.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:40.470
I look up.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.910
It's Frank Sinatra.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.035
I said, oh, hi.

00:02:44.035 --> 00:02:45.900
He said, hey, kid.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.220
I says, yes, Mr. Sinatra?

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.450
He says, make sure you cook
as good as your pop does.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:49.790
[END PLAYBACK]

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.020
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: What were
some of the other dishes Frank

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.520
liked?

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.180
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: He like stuffed
artichoke, which I just made.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.410
I taped the other day
on Meredith Vieira.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.500
I'm going to be on March 17th.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.000
And I guess it's appropriate
it's St. Patrick's Day, so it

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.102
was green food.

00:03:03.102 --> 00:03:04.560
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN:
Artichoke, right.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.685
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: And he
liked the veal Milanese was

00:03:06.685 --> 00:03:08.160
his favorite for a main course.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.950
It's a scallopini of veal,
very thin, flour, eggs,

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.135
seasoned bread crumbs,
fried until it was crisp.

00:03:13.135 --> 00:03:15.260
He really-- I mean, he ate
more or less everything.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.218
One of the things, towards
the end of his life,

00:03:17.218 --> 00:03:19.290
he couldn't eat as
much-- eating the garlic.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.590
So anything I made
for him with garlic,

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.320
I would saute the whole
cloves in the olive oil just

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.820
to get the flavor, and
take out the garlic then,

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.710
and add the tomatoes.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.400
Or if it was to the artichokes
or anything like that.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.150
It's just amazing.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.110
We say it's the restaurant
made famous by Frank Sinatra.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.080
And we're so lucky that if
you come into the restaurant,

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.412
you see there's a lot of
celebrity photos on the wall.

00:03:41.412 --> 00:03:43.370
And almost every one of
them could be connected

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.650
to Frank one way or another.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.830
Like he brought in Frankie Valli
in 1962, the year I was born.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.580
He was coming to our
restaurant 54 years now

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.391
because Frank brought
him the first time.

00:03:53.391 --> 00:03:54.390
He brought Tony Bennett.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.556
He brought Rosemary Clooney.

00:03:55.556 --> 00:03:56.700
He brought George Clooney.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:57.940
And it's really amazing.

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.590
I mean, my father just told me
recently-- I wish my father--

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.006
you know, he
remembers everything,

00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:05.260
but do you have to sort of get
it out of him to talk about it.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.770
He was telling me that 1969,
after the astronauts landed

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.810
on the moon, and then they
had the parade in downtown New

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.570
York, Frank brought
him to Patsy's.

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:15.700
And it's amazing.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.709
Even to this day, someone
who you might not realize

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.290
is a big Sinatra
fan is P. Diddy.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.360
And he started coming in
because he loves Frank.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.595
And with a city of 20,000
restaurants, I mean,

00:04:28.595 --> 00:04:30.970
you have to have the good
food, the good service, and all

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.470
those things, of course.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.640
But to have somebody
walk through that door

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.250
the first time-- and
hopefully, then you

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.802
do your job to keep
them coming back.

00:04:38.802 --> 00:04:40.010
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Absolutely.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.111
So he walked in the door
the first time when?

00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:45.360
It was before you were 13
and you got him in the door.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.790
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Yes, of course.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.346
Well, you know, my
grandfather first met him.

00:04:49.346 --> 00:04:51.220
My grandfather had a
restaurant for two years

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.570
before he opened Patsy's
from 1942 to 1944

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:55.765
called the Sorrento.

00:04:55.765 --> 00:04:58.390
And my grandfather had a little
bit of a reputation in business

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.370
because he was a manager, he
was a waiter, he was a busboy.

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.140
He worked in all
different restaurants.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.740
So he had a little
bit of a following.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.665
And there was a man
named Tommy Dorsey.

00:05:06.665 --> 00:05:10.770
He was a bandleader who was
pretty responsible for starting

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:11.740
off Frank Sinatra.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.510
And he brought Sinatra to
my grandfather back in 1942

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.820
and said, hey, Patsy.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.290
I got this skinny
kid from Hoboken.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.080
I want you to fatten
him up for me.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.770
And that started a
great relationship.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.130
Even Michael Buble comes in
now because he loves Sinatra

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.630
as well.

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:27.640
That's how he started coming in.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.120
And he didn't
really become famous

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.540
until after Frank passed away.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:33.040
One of the things that grandma
and grandpa always taught us,

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.590
though, was that-- and it
may sound a little bit hokey

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.360
in today's climate--
but this was just

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.990
a bigger version of their home.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.950
This was the food
they cooked at home.

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.160
You had a bigger kitchen
and a bigger dining room,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.480
but you want to welcome
these people as family.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.350
And, if you go back
to what I just said,

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.137
there's 20,000 restaurants.

00:05:50.137 --> 00:05:52.220
You know, I have to go
over and thank those people

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.630
for making the decision
to walk through that door.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:56.272
You know, it's a big deal to us.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:57.480
And we never take it lightly.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.760
We never rest on our laurels.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.360
We want to make sure every meal
was as good as the last one

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.910
that they had because,
you know, they

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:05.330
can choose not to come back.

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.250
That's part of it.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.400
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Well, I've
certainly experienced that.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.441
I mean, I think from the
beginning when I've been

00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:14.430
coming, since the mid-'90s,
the second time I came in, they

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:15.550
remembered me.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.200
Sal's father, Joe, who still
works at the front a lot

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.700
remembered.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.617
He didn't know my name.

00:06:20.617 --> 00:06:21.491
He probably called
me kid or something,

00:06:21.491 --> 00:06:22.660
but he remembered me.

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.970
And I think to this day,
that's such a theme at Patsy's.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:27.450
You treat everybody like family.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:27.940
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: We try.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.420
We really do.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.160
And, you know, like you were
saying in the beginning,

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:32.710
it's our only location,
Patsy's Italian Restaurant.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:35.350
Other places, Patsy Pizza
is not affiliated with us.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.170
It's a long story.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:37.820
I won't bore you
with the details.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.340
But it's important to us.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.204
The recipes are the same.

00:06:42.204 --> 00:06:43.620
The heart of the
menu is the same.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.440
Most of the supplies
I buy are the same.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.070
But one of the things that I
want to thank Michael publicly

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.790
here is that he
was the first one

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:53.629
to go on social media,
things like that.

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:55.920
And we have the Facebook and
the Twitter and Instagram.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.590
And of course, my
kids know better

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.840
than I do how to do that stuff.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.330
But it's amazing how
much you get from that.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:07.740
I mean, it's also helped us
to shift more of our energy

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.120
and resources a little
bit away from advertising,

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.000
traditional sense, to
advertising this way

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.970
and getting customers
this way, which is great.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.420
Back in '94, which was
our 50th anniversary,

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.060
we came out with
the sauce, which

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:26.992
was a product of our customers
always asking us, gee,

00:07:26.992 --> 00:07:28.450
you have such a
great tomato sauce.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:29.449
Can you put it in a jar?

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.740
And up until then, there
really wasn't anything

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.040
that-- I know my father wasn't
going to do it on his own.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:36.660
And we had to twist
his arm to do it.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:39.790
But this was something that
now, believe it or not,

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:40.890
brings customers to us.

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.910
People can buy this
in supermarkets

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.200
across the country.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.946
And if they bought in California
and are heading to New York,

00:07:46.946 --> 00:07:48.070
they want to try our place.

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.202
And that's another way of
getting to see where we are.

00:07:51.202 --> 00:07:52.660
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN:
Well, and I would

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.284
say you're probably
not giving yourself

00:07:54.284 --> 00:07:57.040
enough credit on social media.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.810
If you go to the
Facebook page, you'll

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:02.042
see Sal is really a master
at sharing things, which

00:08:02.042 --> 00:08:03.000
is what we really want.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.390
You want to see a
great plate of pasta.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:09.780
And you share some amazing
dishes on social media.

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.820
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Recipe Monday
every Monday on Facebook.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.650
Almost 9 times out of 10,
that gets the most hits.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.909
I mean, really, that's
what it comes down to is

00:08:18.909 --> 00:08:20.200
you want to have the good food.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.553
You want to have
a good experience.

00:08:22.553 --> 00:08:24.960
You're not spending your
hard earned dollars not

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:26.370
to enjoy yourself, of course.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.010
And being in the
theater district

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.380
is helpful, right by Carnegie
Hall, all the major theaters.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:32.929
It's always been a great area.

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:34.950
It's only gotten better
throughout the years.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.919
And even the website, we get
so many hits on the website.

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:39.480
People find.

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:40.480
They want to see a menu.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:42.490
They want to see what
kind of food you have.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.700
And it's something that, really,
we try and keep up to date

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.310
as much as we can with it.

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.180
Like I said, my children
are better at this as well.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.610
And god willing, they may
be the fourth generation.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.400
My older boy loves business.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:56.020
He's second year in college now.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.160
And the younger one is
a senior in high school,

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.500
and he wants to cook.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.006
So I said to my
father-- I always

00:09:01.006 --> 00:09:03.547
tease my dad, who's been working
here for the whole 72 years,

00:09:03.547 --> 00:09:04.760
by the way.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.720
I said, I think I'm going
to retire before you.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.230
And when I say that,
I have to duck.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.380
But it's great.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.972
I mean, I'm lucky to be
with my family as well.

00:09:13.972 --> 00:09:16.430
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Well, back
to Frank Sinatra for a second.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.830
So every year, you have
a birthday celebration

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.060
on Frank's birthday.

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.980
You had the 100th
celebration just recently,

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.740
which became a whole week.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.870
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Yes.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.703
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Maybe
tell me a little bit

00:09:28.703 --> 00:09:29.980
about how that came to be.

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:31.000
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: We
always celebrated

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.360
his birthday, December 12th.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.130
And this year was a special one
because, as you just mentioned,

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.320
he turned 100.

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.300
So we had Sirius XM, we
had Siriusly Sinatra,

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.260
the station devoted to him.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.780
They came in and we did
a three hour live show.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.629
And Steve Tyrrell was the host.

00:09:45.629 --> 00:09:47.170
And we had several
people calling in,

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:50.310
but the first caller was Tina
Sinatra, Frank's daughter,

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.180
which was fun.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.660
And it's just amazing how
he's influenced so many

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.920
other artists now these days.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:59.550
I mentioned P. Diddy before.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:01.633
If you look at some of the
commercials-- I believe

00:10:01.633 --> 00:10:03.332
it's for Ciroc vodka--
"Luck Be a Lady"

00:10:03.332 --> 00:10:04.540
is playing in the background.

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:07.840
So it's just a timeless thing.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:11.390
And if you could ask for a
better PR person than him,

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:14.030
I don't know if you could
find someone to promote you.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:15.720
And it's something
that if he liked you,

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.928
you didn't want for anything.

00:10:16.928 --> 00:10:18.670
So it was really a lot of fun.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.247
And that celebration,
like you said,

00:10:20.247 --> 00:10:21.830
because so many
people wanted to come,

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.110
we did five different
parties because we

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:26.670
couldn't fit everyone into
the restaurant on the one day.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:27.545
But it was wonderful.

00:10:27.545 --> 00:10:29.820
And it's just a thing
we're so proud and honored

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:31.102
to carry on as well.

00:10:31.102 --> 00:10:33.060
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: So
reserve now for next year.

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:33.460
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Next
year, put it down.

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.330
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: The 101st.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:35.450
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Yes.

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:37.325
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Now,
I would imagine, then,

00:10:37.325 --> 00:10:40.330
you have a story or two
of Frank Sinatra, above

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:42.810
and beyond what we saw in
the video of meeting him.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.610
There was probably
some great moments.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.110
SAL SCOGNAMILLO:
So many fun things.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:49.230
I mean, with my experience,
when I was 16, 1978,

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:51.590
New York Yankees won
the World Series.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.590
They called up my
father, Joe, and said

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:57.330
Billy Martin, the manager,
wanted to bring the whole team.

00:10:57.330 --> 00:10:59.550
They made a reservation
for 50 people.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.450
Upstairs can be parties
of two, four, six, or so.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:03.547
It could be separated.

00:11:03.547 --> 00:11:05.130
The back room with
Sinatra-- actually,

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.980
the front of the restaurant.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.350
Sinatra used to sit, would
be about 30, 35 people.

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:11.477
The other section,
you could do 50.

00:11:11.477 --> 00:11:13.060
So when the Yankees
arrived, my father

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:15.440
had them set up in the
front part of the room.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.590
And he congratulated them.

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:17.673
They won the World Series.

00:11:17.673 --> 00:11:20.134
And Billy Martin, the
manager, said to my father,

00:11:20.134 --> 00:11:21.550
well, why don't
we sit over there?

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:23.340
We're supposed to
sit back there.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.715
He's pointing
behind the curtain.

00:11:24.715 --> 00:11:26.490
And my father was
trying to be diplomatic,

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:27.948
but he didn't
realize what he said.

00:11:27.948 --> 00:11:30.300
He said, I have that saved
for someone really important.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.490
So Billy Martin was really
angry with my father.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.740
And obviously, a few minutes
later, we got the signal.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.930
Sinatra would come in
the private entrance.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.639
And Sinatra was
coming up the steps,

00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:41.430
and Billy Martin was
face to face with him.

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:44.300
And Billy Martin, of
course, was the Yankees.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.420
And Sinatra, people don't
realize, was a Dodgers fan.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:48.740
Yanks just beat the Dodgers.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.240
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Oh boy.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.510
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: So he wasn't
happy to see Billy Martin.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:53.130
And he said, what the
hell are you doing here?

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.430
And Billy Martin, for the
first time in his life,

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.930
was tongue tied, a
little tongue tied.

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.525
And Sinatra walked back behind
the curtain with his party.

00:12:00.525 --> 00:12:02.400
And then Billy Martin
came over to my father,

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.010
instead of being angry, he said,
I want to meet Frank Sinatra.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:06.390
My father said,
you just met him.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:08.120
He says, yeah, but
I got tongue tied.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.430
So my father asked Frank.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.180
He says, it's OK.

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.740
Just bring Billy
back, no one else.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.570
I'm a little tired.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:14.920
I flew in from the West Coast.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.390
My father told
Billy to come back.

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.670
And Billy Martin, being
Billy Martin-- those of you

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.730
who knew him-- was a hothead.

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:23.341
He stepped up on top
of one of the tables

00:12:23.341 --> 00:12:24.840
and said to the
whole team, come on.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.332
We're going to
meet Frank Sinatra.

00:12:26.332 --> 00:12:27.540
And it took him a whole hour.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.360
And he was just very
patient and very nice.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.610
He congratulated everyone.

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:33.060
And Yanks ate their dinner
and Sinatra ate his dinner.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.130
Normally, that would be
the end of the story.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.130
About three hours go by.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.000
Frank gets up, pulls
the curtain back,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.940
waves goodbye to
the Yankee team.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.864
Yankee team applauds
him and he leaves.

00:12:42.864 --> 00:12:44.280
Billy Martin comes
over to my dad.

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:45.180
He said, oh my god.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.520
That was-- what a special
night we just had.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.830
We won the World Series, we
ate at Patsy's restaurant,

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:50.685
and we met Frank Sinatra.

00:12:50.685 --> 00:12:52.960
He says, we weren't going
to leave until Frank left.

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.450
He says, now that Frank had
left, he says, we can go.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.420
Can I please have the check?

00:12:58.420 --> 00:12:59.840
My father hesitated
for a second.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.140
He says, I'm sorry,
Billy, I can't do that.

00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:03.636
Frank picked it up for you.

00:13:03.636 --> 00:13:04.260
The whole team.

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.614
He bought dinner
for the whole team.

00:13:06.614 --> 00:13:07.780
He was-- he was a great man.

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.790
I mean, you know, if he didn't
like someone, stay away.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.010
But if he liked you,
you were in good shape.

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:14.240
You were in good shape.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.580
But it really is, for me,
it's-- I'm a very lucky person.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.400
I mean, I get to do what I love.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.400
So you say you never
work a day in your life

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.358
when you're doing that.

00:13:22.358 --> 00:13:25.630
And I've been full time
since January of '85.

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:27.120
I took television
film production,

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.620
so I love this
part of it as well.

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:28.910
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Right.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.920
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: I
couldn't get a job,

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.710
so my father said, would you
like to learn how to cook?

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:34.334
And, you know, that's
also a great part

00:13:34.334 --> 00:13:37.330
about it is I wasn't
forced into the business,

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.180
as I wouldn't do for
my children as well.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:41.475
And I really enjoy it.

00:13:41.475 --> 00:13:42.100
I'm very lucky.

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.730
I meet nice people all the time.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.410
We've become very
good friends-- I mean,

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.049
just a wonderful
byproduct of being

00:13:48.049 --> 00:13:49.590
in this type of
business where you're

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:50.952
trying to make people happy.

00:13:50.952 --> 00:13:52.910
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Well,
and hearing that story,

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:54.993
the wonderful thing about,
I think, your cookbooks

00:13:54.993 --> 00:13:57.730
is you integrate the
stories throughout both this

00:13:57.730 --> 00:14:02.800
and the first cookbook,
which just adds to the flavor

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.010
and makes you want to
eat the food as you're

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.460
reading some of the stories.

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:08.880
How did this
cookbook come about?

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.530
I know the first cookbook did
very well, was a bestseller.

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:14.292
This one is an Italian
family cookbook, it's called.

00:14:14.292 --> 00:14:16.000
How is this different
than the first one?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.630
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Well, the
first one is more or less almost

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:20.290
all restaurant recipes.

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:23.140
This one, I try to integrate
some of our family recipes

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:25.920
as well, which really are what
we do there, too, but just

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.470
some of the ones that haven't
always been on the menu,

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.230
that we'll make as
specials as well.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:33.524
And, you know, it was always,
for me-- even the first book,

00:14:33.524 --> 00:14:35.190
which is this one
here, and the foreword

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.940
was written by Nancy
Sinatra, Frank's daughter--

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.530
it was about really
getting some type

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.050
of a history of the
restaurant written down,

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:45.030
because all these great
stories would be lost

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:47.060
and all the history
of it would be lost.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:51.650
I mean, I really admire
what my grandparents did,

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:52.380
as I mentioned.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.600
And a really funny
story is that grandpa--

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.320
he passed in '86, grandpa Patsy.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.520
And I became a chef in '85.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:03.480
And last time he was at the
restaurant was late '85.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.160
And there was a group of
us waiting-- family members

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.270
waiting for him to come.

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:09.478
He lived in Jersey at the
time and he couldn't drive,

00:15:09.478 --> 00:15:10.800
so someone drove him in.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.300
And we were so happy grandpa
was coming to see us.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.330
We were going to
have dinner together.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:16.079
We usually eat about
3:00 in the afternoon

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:17.870
in between lunch and dinner.

00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:20.490
And grandpa pulls up, and the
whole family, hey, welcome,

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:21.489
grandpa.

00:15:21.489 --> 00:15:22.530
And he didn't say a word.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:24.840
He walked past all of us,
walked in the kitchen,

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:27.600
went down the steps in the
refrigerator, came back up.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.087
And I said, grandpa,
what happened?

00:15:29.087 --> 00:15:30.670
He says, now I could
say hello to you.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:31.730
He says, I wanted
to check and see

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:34.105
if you were still buying the
same veal I told you to buy.

00:15:34.105 --> 00:15:38.432
So you know, it was that kind of
a feeling that-- and he just--

00:15:38.432 --> 00:15:39.700
that was his life.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:42.260
And used to wear this
little gray jacket.

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:43.840
Everyone thought
he was a busboy.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.956
And we always say, you know,
pop, why don't you dress up?

00:15:46.956 --> 00:15:48.080
You're the owner and stuff.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.126
He says, no.

00:15:49.126 --> 00:15:50.750
People won't ask me
to fill their water

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:51.680
or bring them the bread then.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.013
They'll be intimidated to ask
the owner to do something.

00:15:54.013 --> 00:15:57.991
So he was really about service,
and we just try and echo that

00:15:57.991 --> 00:15:58.490
as well.

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.700
I mean, again, you know,
so many other restaurants

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:01.575
that you could go to.

00:16:01.575 --> 00:16:02.550
Why go here?

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.560
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Well, and
you're always out in the room.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.790
I think I've never
been there that you

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:10.549
didn't come out and talk to
everybody at every table.

00:16:10.549 --> 00:16:12.840
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: I always
try and make sure, go around,

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.000
everything's OK.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.500
And if everyone's
shown up for work

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.590
and no one's on vacation or no
one's out sick, I can do that.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:23.310
Because, again, my
bulk of my work, which

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:25.960
is making the soups, the
sauces, the things that take

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.170
time-- cutting up
the veal, the baking.

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:31.740
If I get all that done by
about 3:00, which I usually do,

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.474
I can go out and mingle,
which is my favorite part.

00:16:34.474 --> 00:16:36.140
And, you know, in
case sometimes there's

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.860
a party of 20 in the back and
the captain's taking the order,

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.080
and there may be a
party of two that's

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.246
waiting a little bit longer.

00:16:41.246 --> 00:16:44.010
And you don't want to let
that slip through the cracks

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:45.550
that someone's being ignored.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.290
And, you know, again,
they're spending

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:47.990
their hard-earned money.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.570
You've got to make sure
they're happy as well.

00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:50.550
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Sure.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:52.150
So Patsy's Italian
Family Cookbook.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:55.990
You know, I also like
being an aspiring cook.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:57.660
I would never be a chef.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.070
And I love to make Italian food.

00:16:59.070 --> 00:17:01.940
But just some of the
nuggets of information.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.290
I think two probably
primary ingredients

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.209
in most Italian dishes
are olive oil and garlic.

00:17:07.209 --> 00:17:09.000
And I think there's
some interesting things

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.140
in the cookbook.

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.750
Maybe you can share, how do
you pick a good olive oil?

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:13.770
SAL SCOGNAMILLO:
Well, you know, it's

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:15.144
got to have the
right-- you know,

00:17:15.144 --> 00:17:17.040
and people always talk
about extra virgin.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.890
And I use that for
non-cooked dishes,

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:22.069
like the roast peppers,
the mozzarella, the salads,

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:23.560
things like that.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.550
Because once you
start cooking it,

00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:27.170
you don't get the
full flavor of it.

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.990
So you could use
olive oil to cook.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:32.070
We use from Umbria is usually
the best region I found,

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:35.680
but there's so many that you
can get that are good now.

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:39.750
Garlic, of course, you have
to make sure it's fresh.

00:17:39.750 --> 00:17:42.430
We take it, peel it off,
and usually chop it.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.827
And that's the way like
a marinara is made.

00:17:44.827 --> 00:17:46.410
And we say the holy
trinity is garlic,

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:47.451
oil, and tomatoes, right?

00:17:47.451 --> 00:17:48.940
The three best ingredients.

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.810
But what's interesting is
that a lot of our sauces,

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:53.310
even in the jar,
the bestselling one

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:55.080
is the marinara,
which is the garlic.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.129
The second best is
the tomato basil.

00:17:57.129 --> 00:17:58.670
A lot of times, I
see companies, when

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:00.890
you go to market
like a pasta sauce,

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:02.390
they'll have three
different labels.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.015
They'll have a spaghetti sauce,
a marinara, and a tomato basil.

00:18:05.015 --> 00:18:06.690
It's the same sauce.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:07.840
This sauce is distinctive.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:11.290
The tomato basil is different
seasonings, and it's onions.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:12.440
There's no garlic.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.267
And people say, wait, wait.

00:18:14.267 --> 00:18:15.600
Italian food has to have garlic.

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.030
And not necessarily.

00:18:17.030 --> 00:18:17.700
Not necessarily.

00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:19.600
Even we make a
filetto di pomodoro,

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:22.180
which is onion,
tomatoes, and prosciutto.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.070
The meat sauce that
we make is a red sauce

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:26.210
because we're from southern
Italy, from Naples,

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:27.770
and that we use tomato in.

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:29.280
And it's onions--
again, no garlic.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.529
I mean, if someone wants it,
of course, we can add it.

00:18:31.529 --> 00:18:35.180
Most dishes are cooked to order,
so we can do that as well.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.850
But it's not always so.

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:39.710
And my father, as
he's gotten older,

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:41.441
he can't digest
the garlic as well.

00:18:41.441 --> 00:18:43.190
That's what we talked
about Frank Sinatra.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:45.780
So if we make a dish, we
saute the whole cloves

00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:47.680
to get the flavor
in the olive oil,

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.890
and then put your tomatoes
in and stuff like that.

00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:54.149
The red sauce is the
base of the kitchen.

00:18:54.149 --> 00:18:55.690
But the heart of
the menu is the same

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.100
as when grandma and
grandpa started.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.350
As I mentioned before, many
of the distributors we use

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:01.510
are the same.

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:04.980
And the people we're buying
mozzarella is called Di Palo.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.580
It's downtown on Grand Street.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.680
And we're their longest
customer for 72 years.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.070
Now, they've been in
business since 1920.

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.874
And they're also third
generation as well.

00:19:13.874 --> 00:19:14.790
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Wow.

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.650
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: So it's
a level of consistency.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:20.480
I think one compliment
that I remember

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:22.220
that was one of my
favorites of all time

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.720
is a steady customer who's
been coming since before I was

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.270
a chef, you know, how am I
going to feel about cooking

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:28.440
for someone like that?

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.550
I said, you know,
here's your table.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:32.160
I hope you enjoy
everything tonight.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.909
Sal, I know what the
food's going to taste

00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:35.170
like before I come here.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:37.747
So that was the kind of thing
that really stuck in my head

00:19:37.747 --> 00:19:39.830
to say, you know, hey,
you've got a responsibility

00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:42.650
to make sure it's
consistent all the time.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.690
And we don't try to be
something we're not.

00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:46.587
It's not a fancy,
frou frou restaurant.

00:19:46.587 --> 00:19:48.420
But it's a good,
stick-to-your-ribs southern

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.044
Italian red sauce joint.

00:19:50.044 --> 00:19:51.460
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN:
Red sauce joint.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.840
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: As
Frank Sinatra would say.

00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:53.940
As Sinatra would say.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.140
And hopefully, that's
what appeals to people.

00:19:57.140 --> 00:19:59.480
And we're lucky so far.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.320
We're doing OK.

00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.611
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: I feel like
I always burn the garlic.

00:20:02.611 --> 00:20:04.450
Is there a way-- a trick--

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:06.700
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: A lot of
people heat up the oil first

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:09.033
and then put the garlic in,
and it will burn right away.

00:20:09.033 --> 00:20:11.784
I put it in when the oil
is still room temperature.

00:20:11.784 --> 00:20:12.700
And then you brown it.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.075
And if you do burn
it, it's gone.

00:20:14.075 --> 00:20:15.200
You've got to start over.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.600
There's no salvaging that.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.930
Even the oil is going
to have that flavor.

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:21.990
And, of course, it's being
such a big flavor in a dish,

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:24.780
garlic has a strong flavor,
you have to redo it then.

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:27.029
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: My mouth
is salivating just thinking

00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:28.296
about garlic cooking, right?

00:20:28.296 --> 00:20:29.920
SAL SCOGNAMILLO:
Garlic and oil, right?

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.010
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Are
there particular recipes

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.605
in this cookbook that are
favorites of yours that

00:20:34.605 --> 00:20:35.480
sort of come to mind?

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.970
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: I
always default to pasta.

00:20:36.970 --> 00:20:39.340
And, as you see, the cover
is spaghetti and meatballs.

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.640
And it's a funny story
with the meatballs.

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.020
They were off the menu
for a little while.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.320
And I kept saying to my dad,
it was like the late '80s.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.210
It wasn't as "chic" to have
spaghetti and meatballs,

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:50.710
I guess.

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:51.395
I don't know.

00:20:51.395 --> 00:20:53.770
And I said to my dad, I said,
we should put them back on.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.270
Everyone asks for
them all the time.

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.910
And we had such a
big fight over it.

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:58.576
He was like, no, it's
been off the menu.

00:20:58.576 --> 00:21:01.780
And I said, look, we have this
section with the specials.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.040
Let's try it for a few days.

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.430
If not, we just take
that section off.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:07.780
And he says, I'm never
going to question you again.

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.891
We sold like 1,300
meatballs the first week.

00:21:10.891 --> 00:21:12.140
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: I ate 1,200.

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:12.950
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Yeah,
I was going to say--

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:15.158
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: I love
the spaghetti and meatballs.

00:21:15.158 --> 00:21:17.680
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Well,
it's a veal meatball.

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.460
A lot of people do the
veal, beef, and pork, which

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.010
is what my mother-in-law does.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:23.190
My mother makes just beef.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:25.590
But Grandpa Patsy, it was veal.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:28.050
And I think it was mainly
because that was what

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:29.660
his scrap was when he cleaned.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.902
We used to clean the
whole leg of veal.

00:21:31.902 --> 00:21:33.110
And you'd always have scraps.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.526
You make the meat
sauce from that.

00:21:34.526 --> 00:21:36.827
You chop it up and
make the meatballs.

00:21:36.827 --> 00:21:38.660
Now the pieces come
already cleaned for you.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:39.780
It's much easier.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:43.300
But it's definitely-- what I've
noticed about it is it's more

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.490
gelatinous.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.065
So it keeps it moister.

00:21:47.065 --> 00:21:48.440
When you have the
veal meatballs,

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.790
they feel like they're
lighter and they feel moister,

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.386
you know, more juice to it.

00:21:52.386 --> 00:21:54.260
And that's what people
seem to love about it.

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.166
That's Frankie
Valli's favorite dish.

00:21:56.166 --> 00:21:58.540
He talked about that on-- I
think it was the YES Network.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:01.930
They did an interview with him
on the Yankee network about it.

00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:02.647
It's fun.

00:22:02.647 --> 00:22:04.230
And, you know, I
know I've got to make

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.390
sure I make enough
meatballs when

00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.290
that show airs, which is fun.

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:10.700
It's been great.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.930
Since the first cookbook
came out, it was 2002.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:17.190
I was able to get on TV
shows and things like that.

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:18.670
And again, that's
another vehicle

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.480
to let people know
about your restaurant.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.920
I mean, as much as
sometimes you may think

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.680
people know about you, no.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.279
It's hard to keep it relevant.

00:22:28.279 --> 00:22:29.820
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN:
Well, you certainly

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:31.790
have been on TV a lot.

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:34.150
When Tony Danza had his
show, I feel like you

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:36.019
were on almost every week.

00:22:36.019 --> 00:22:37.810
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Tony
Danza is so much fun.

00:22:37.810 --> 00:22:39.420
And you know, I've
been so blessed.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:40.890
I've been on the Today
Show, Martha Stewart.

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:42.806
As I mentioned, we're
going to be on-- I taped

00:22:42.806 --> 00:22:44.030
a show for Meredith Vieira.

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:46.071
I think Tony Danza was
the only person I couldn't

00:22:46.071 --> 00:22:48.090
teach how to cook anything.

00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.010
It was funny.

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:50.990
He's quite a character.

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:53.090
Actually, I think
he got in trouble

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:56.610
that he talked about Patsy's
Italian Restaurant so much.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.230
I think he got a letter
from the Olive Garden

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:01.022
because they're a
corporate sponsor.

00:23:01.022 --> 00:23:02.980
They said, we're spending
hundreds of thousands

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.420
of dollars to put
ads for your show,

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.459
and you're mentioning
this one for free.

00:23:07.459 --> 00:23:10.000
But I think that's part of the
reason he got fired because he

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:10.650
did whatever he wanted.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:11.691
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Oh boy.

00:23:11.691 --> 00:23:12.660
Now we know the truth.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:14.701
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: But I'll
tell you a funny story.

00:23:14.701 --> 00:23:17.291
How I met Tony Danza was when
the first cookbook came out,

00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:19.040
as I mentioned, I got
a lot of interviews.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.130
And one of the interviews I
did was with Where magazine.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:23.560
It's in all the hotels, Where.

00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.280
It shows you where
everything is.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.980
And they asked me a question
I wasn't asked on an interview

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:28.480
before.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:29.460
It was interesting.

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:30.410
They were looking
at the pictures

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:31.993
on the wall at the
restaurant and they

00:23:31.993 --> 00:23:34.110
said, Sal, whose picture
is missing from there?

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:36.650
In other words, which
celebrity has never

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:38.009
come that you'd like to meet?

00:23:38.009 --> 00:23:39.800
And I instantly said,
I says, oh, you know,

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.360
I've always admired Tony Danza.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.137
He's so much fun.

00:23:42.137 --> 00:23:44.470
He grew up on Long Island,
not far from where I grew up,

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:45.740
where I still live.

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:48.450
And somehow, that made
it into the article.

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:52.510
Somehow, a bartender at
a hotel he was staying at

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:54.290
showed him the article.

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:55.790
And he saw it.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:58.380
He walks in with the
article in one hand,

00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:01.300
and you could picture Tony like
this, screaming and yelling.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.740
I see my name in the paper.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:03.540
I'm here.

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.350
Where's this guy Sal?

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:07.230
And it was so much
fun because-- and I

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:08.840
didn't know whether to hug
him or hide under the table.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.460
I says, oh my god, look at this.

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:14.820
And he was flattered that
I wanted to meet him.

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.910
It so boggles my mind.

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:18.320
It's so cool.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.010
And we became friends,
which is nice.

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:22.560
And, like you said, when
he had his television show

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:25.740
two years in New York, I think
it was on five or six times.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:26.870
It was a lot of fun.

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:27.760
It's a lot of fun.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:30.920
You know, my kids
were younger then.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.030
It was about 9 years
ago, 10 years ago.

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:35.600
We were in Disney
for a vacation.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:39.190
And we're waiting on a
line for one of the rides.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.910
And some man ran
up to me and says,

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:44.510
are you Sal from
Patsy's Restaurant?

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:45.920
I saw you on the
Tony Danza show.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.200
Can I have your autograph?

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.350
I was like, I went over
to my wife, and says,

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:52.520
you told him to do this, right?

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.196
He says, no, no.

00:24:54.196 --> 00:24:56.070
So, I mean, yeah, we
got a lot of recognition

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:58.310
from that one, which was
fun-- which was a lot of fun.

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:59.893
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN:
Well, another actor,

00:24:59.893 --> 00:25:01.500
who wrote the
foreword, Ben Stiller,

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.360
how did that connection happen?

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.070
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Well, you
know, Jerry Stiller, his father,

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:09.430
and Anne Meara, who
sadly passed last year,

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:12.700
were very close
with Frank Sinatra.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.260
But the way they
first came in was

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:17.350
they did the Ed Sullivan Show.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.580
Still and Meara
was a comedy team.

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:21.740
The younger ones amongst
us that don't know,

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:23.820
that's Ben Stiller's parents.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:25.900
And they did the
Ed Sullivan Show,

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:30.260
which was taped with
David Letterman, where

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:31.505
Stephen Colbert is now.

00:25:34.214 --> 00:25:36.240
To get on the Ed Sullivan
Show in those days

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.350
was like-- that was
the gold standard.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:41.850
And to celebrate, we wanted to
go to a real, white tablecloth

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:42.350
restaurant.

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:43.464
That's the first time.

00:25:43.464 --> 00:25:45.130
And that was in the
early '60s that they

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:46.710
came to our restaurant.

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.710
And they've been
coming ever since.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:50.240
And they brought their children.

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.770
I mean, Ben Stiller
wrote a foreword

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:53.580
that it makes me cry
when I look at it.

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:56.050
I mean, just to condense
it real quickly, basically,

00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:59.520
what he says is that he
remembers my grandfather.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.550
And he was a little boy.

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:02.590
And he'd come with
his sister Amy.

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:05.157
And he'd say, what can
I make for you tonight?

00:26:05.157 --> 00:26:06.240
You know, please sit down.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.573
What can I make for you tonight?

00:26:07.573 --> 00:26:10.225
And then he recounts when
my father became the chef.

00:26:10.225 --> 00:26:11.850
And my father would
say the same thing.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:13.183
What can I make for you tonight?

00:26:13.183 --> 00:26:14.960
And when I became a chef.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:16.910
And then he ends the
foreword with saying,

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:20.290
I can't wait for Sal's son
Peter to come and be the chef

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.590
and ask me, what can I
make for you tonight?

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:25.720
I mean, it's so
overwhelming to me

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.830
that these people
have such a loyalty,

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:30.970
and not just celebrities.

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:33.370
The customers,
generations of customers.

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:35.940
And people come in, and if they
had their children with them,

00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:39.160
I said, oh, you made more
customers for us now.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.610
So it's really--
I can't get over

00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:45.750
how lucky we are that people
are so fiercely loyal to us

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.256
as well.

00:26:46.256 --> 00:26:47.400
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Sure.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.170
SAL SCOGNAMILLO:
It's a big deal.

00:26:48.170 --> 00:26:49.961
And in New York, if
you're open five years,

00:26:49.961 --> 00:26:51.240
that's like a big deal.

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.620
72 years, thank god.

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:57.150
But as long as
people want it, we'll

00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.140
be happy to keep
serving as well.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.350
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Well,
we're going to open it up

00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:01.433
for questions in a minute.

00:27:01.433 --> 00:27:04.149
But you know, 72
years, what's next?

00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:05.690
We're going to have
to start planning

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.297
for the 100th
anniversary, right?

00:27:07.297 --> 00:27:09.130
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: God
willing, we'll be here.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:11.560
And yeah, like I said, my
children, I won't force them.

00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.989
They're both interested.

00:27:12.989 --> 00:27:15.030
Joseph, the older one,
likes the business aspect,

00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:17.340
and Peter likes the
cooking aspect of it.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:19.149
And god willing, if
they want to come in,

00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:20.940
we're going to try and
continue to do this.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.189
I mean, the way we have
branched out, as we mentioned,

00:27:23.189 --> 00:27:25.414
the sauce and the cookbooks
and things like that.

00:27:25.414 --> 00:27:27.080
You know, god willing,
who knows if it's

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.246
in the future, other places.

00:27:28.246 --> 00:27:30.530
But you never know what
could happen with that.

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:33.740
It's always important to us
that the quality stays the same.

00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:35.982
I mean, even when we put
this sauce in the jar,

00:27:35.982 --> 00:27:37.690
we had this done by
co-packers, you know,

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:40.780
companies that do this for you.

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:43.650
And one of the things we always
got when we went to co-packers

00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:46.400
is, we're already making
an Italian spaghetti sauce.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.400
Just give us your label.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.358
We'll slap it on there.

00:27:48.358 --> 00:27:50.370
And you're kind of missing
the point, you know.

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.300
We want our sauce in the jar.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.110
So that was what
was important to us.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:57.445
That was the hardest thing
to convince my dad to do.

00:27:57.445 --> 00:27:58.840
We had to twist his arm.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.120
He says, if it's not
good, it's not coming out.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:04.430
And, you know, he's right.

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:06.010
This is why you
are where you are.

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:07.900
Don't lower your standards.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.460
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: And I think
it's an indication that you

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:14.040
make quality food, and you've
also been open and curious

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.220
to new things.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:19.820
And you've been innovative, from
the sauces to the cookbooks.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.501
You had, I think, the
Google Maps folks came in.

00:28:22.501 --> 00:28:23.750
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: That's right.

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:26.410
The Google Maps did an
inside of our restaurant.

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:29.120
And I'm understanding that's
a big deal, which I was really

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:29.880
excited about.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.156
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN:
Well, it's nice

00:28:30.156 --> 00:28:32.110
because if you don't have a
chance to go to the restaurant,

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:34.690
you can go online, and you can
go in the restaurant and see.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:37.317
I don't know if it takes you
into the Sinatra room upstairs.

00:28:37.317 --> 00:28:38.025
I don't remember.

00:28:38.025 --> 00:28:38.480
SAL SCOGNAMILLO:
I don't remember

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.280
if they did that or not.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.160
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: You have to
go and experience that live.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.785
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: But
that's another way

00:28:42.785 --> 00:28:44.880
to get another generation
that's interested.

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:49.530
And that's why this social
media stuff is relevant, too.

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:50.910
It really makes
a big difference.

00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:53.880
I think a lot of
people tell me--

00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.490
and again, I'm not so good
at this-- but they say,

00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:01.100
we do a Google search, midtown,
family-owned, this, that.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:02.270
And we pop up.

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:03.314
I mean, how big is that?

00:29:03.314 --> 00:29:04.980
I mean, if you're
looking for something.

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.040
Years ago-- it's
still word of mouth,

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:09.612
but years ago, you relied
on a friend, or a concierge

00:29:09.612 --> 00:29:11.070
at a hotel, or
something like that.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:14.320
Now everyone has the phone or
the device to check and see.

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.740
And we've got great
reviews online

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.920
as well, which is helpful.

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:21.465
And that's, again, first
time to get them in.

00:29:21.465 --> 00:29:23.840
And then hopefully, they come
back and tell their friends

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.446
as well.

00:29:24.446 --> 00:29:26.820
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: And those
pictures you post of the food

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:27.720
don't hurt either.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.610
They certainly help.

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:29.210
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: It's tempting.

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:29.510
It's tempting.

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:31.301
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Do
we have any questions?

00:29:31.301 --> 00:29:35.396
Anybody want to step up
to the mic, feel free.

00:29:35.396 --> 00:29:38.100
While you're moving over
there, I'll ask you,

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.990
what is your favorite
thing to eat?

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:43.540
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: I'm always
going to default to pasta.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:45.800
And I think the
rigatoni sorrentino,

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.060
which is sort of
similar to a baked ziti,

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:51.460
but it's with ricotta,
mozzarella, and tomato basil

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.967
sauce and Parmesan
cheese on top.

00:29:53.967 --> 00:29:55.800
And if I'm in the mood
for a garlicky pasta,

00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.490
I love the clam sauce--
very simple, garlic

00:29:58.490 --> 00:30:02.110
and oil, the fresh clams,
a little clam water,

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:04.335
touch of oregano,
fresh basil, no salt

00:30:04.335 --> 00:30:05.460
because it's salty already.

00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:05.920
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Sure.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.680
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Simple
stuff, but that's

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.846
what I'll always default to.

00:30:08.846 --> 00:30:10.790
And that's why I'm
never going to be thin.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.551
But don't trust a
thin chef, right?

00:30:12.551 --> 00:30:13.842
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: That's right.

00:30:13.842 --> 00:30:14.780
AUDIENCE: Hey, Sal.

00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.250
I met you in your restaurant
I think half a year ago

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:18.966
when a lot of us came in there.

00:30:18.966 --> 00:30:19.800
It's very cool to see you again.

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:20.360
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Thank you.

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:20.750
Thank you.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:21.760
AUDIENCE: That's
why I came out here.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.717
Yeah.

00:30:22.717 --> 00:30:24.550
I think somebody was
like inviting you here.

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:25.966
He said, I want
to come to Google.

00:30:25.966 --> 00:30:27.360
So it's good to see that happen.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.060
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: I'm so honored.

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:28.640
Thank you.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.730
AUDIENCE: So what
are some of the most

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:35.449
popular off menu dishes that
people somehow know to order?

00:30:35.449 --> 00:30:36.490
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Oh yeah.

00:30:36.490 --> 00:30:37.900
It's a good question.

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.069
And quite often, if they call me
up and I have the ingredients,

00:30:41.069 --> 00:30:41.610
I'll make it.

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:43.390
If not, give me a
day or two to get it.

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:47.240
And one is braciole, which
is either pork or beef.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.000
And it's a flank.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.990
And you cut up the pork or the
beef and you beat it down flat.

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:55.150
It's stuffed with
chopped beef or pork,

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:58.300
depending on which one, raisins,
pine nuts, garlic, and cheese.

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.505
We roll it up,
braise it in the oil,

00:31:00.505 --> 00:31:02.880
and it slow cooks in the sauce
for about 2 and 1/2, three

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:03.580
hours.

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.750
That's why we always tell
you to order it before.

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:07.710
Another one would be lasagna.

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:10.010
Lasagna, classic
southern Italian dish.

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:15.340
We make four layers-- meatballs,
sausage, cheese, tomato sauce.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:19.340
And it's a popular dish
as well people ask for.

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.070
The things that are
on the menu that you

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:23.120
don't see in other
places that are popular

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:26.440
are tripe, which is one of
the few things I don't eat.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.560
It's honeycombed tripe.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:31.800
It's the intestine of
the stomach of the cow.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.255
But it's really a great sauce.

00:31:33.255 --> 00:31:35.520
It's onions, peas,
and prosciutto.

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.329
And it's stewed with tomato
sauce and white wine,

00:31:39.329 --> 00:31:39.870
very popular.

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.100
When we make the
filetto di pomodoro,

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:48.380
people like that, to
take it to [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:51.120
So it starts off with
onions, prosciutto, tomatoes.

00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:54.210
And [INAUDIBLE], we
add the pancetta,

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:55.980
which is Italian bacon.

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:58.360
And I put a little bit
of regular American bacon

00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.010
in there.

00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:01.690
So you can make derivatives
of different dishes.

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:03.660
And again, if I have
the ingredients,

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.140
I'm more than happy to do it.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:07.790
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN:
There's also a dish

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:11.010
you make-- I don't think it's
on the menu-- with the melon.

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:12.440
You made that for me.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.947
It's a great summer pasta.

00:32:13.947 --> 00:32:15.780
SAL SCOGNAMILLO:
Prosciutto and melon sauce.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:16.650
Doesn't sound that good.

00:32:16.650 --> 00:32:17.686
And it was in the first book.

00:32:17.686 --> 00:32:18.920
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN:
It's fantastic.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.795
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: And
it's a little different.

00:32:20.795 --> 00:32:23.430
But we had a party that had
canceled at the last minute.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.970
And I had made
some melon wrapped

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:28.700
with prosciutto with the
toothpicks to pass around.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:29.480
And I says, oh no.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:29.900
What am I going to do?

00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:31.024
This is all cut up already.

00:32:31.024 --> 00:32:33.610
So we always make dinner
for the employees.

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:34.480
So I just took it.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.590
I sauteed some onions,
some tomato sauce,

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:38.900
a little touch of fresh basil.

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.750
I put it over fresh linguine.

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:42.520
Everyone went crazy for it.

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.170
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN:
It's really good.

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:43.800
SAL SCOGNAMILLO:
Sweet and salty.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.300
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: A strange
combo, but it's really good.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.633
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: It worked good.

00:32:46.633 --> 00:32:48.697
Thank you for reminding
me about that.

00:32:48.697 --> 00:32:50.030
I haven't made that for a while.

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:51.510
But it's always a pleasure.

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:53.220
I mean, that's for
us, we can do it.

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:56.250
You know, it's funny how
so many places you go to,

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:58.360
and you try and
substitute something,

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.540
and they don't want
to know from beans.

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:01.540
They don't want to know.

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:04.100
I have a friend of mine that's
been coming there probably

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.308
a little bit longer than you.

00:33:05.308 --> 00:33:08.180
And I won't mention the name,
but he went to a steakhouse

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:11.180
with his wife and two other
couples, with six people.

00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.160
And you know, they
spent a good $1,200.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.400
And at the end of the
meal, the waitress

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:18.930
was taking the order
for dessert and he says,

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:21.530
I'd just like to
have some ice cream.

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:24.020
And she says, I'm sorry,
sir, we don't have ice cream.

00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:27.120
And he said, well, you just
mentioned one of the desserts

00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:30.673
was pie a la mode, you know, the
apple pie with the vanilla ice

00:33:30.673 --> 00:33:31.790
cream on top.

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:33.860
She says, yeah, but
we can't separate it.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:36.740
So he said, I'll pay
for the whole thing.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:37.490
It doesn't matter.

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:39.001
You know, he's a wealthy man.

00:33:39.001 --> 00:33:39.750
It doesn't matter.

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:42.130
She says, I'm sorry,
we can't do that, sir.

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:43.172
And I think that's what--

00:33:43.172 --> 00:33:44.713
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN:
I think for $1,200,

00:33:44.713 --> 00:33:47.360
I would have gone to the store
and bought ice cream, right?

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.600
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Well, he
was embarrassed because he

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.724
was with two other couples.

00:33:49.724 --> 00:33:52.550
But the thing is I think
that's what takes--

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:54.720
and a lot of people tell
us to do Open Table, which

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.440
I think we eventually will do.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.640
But it takes the human
element out of it.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.730
Open Table's going to
tell you Saturday night,

00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:02.729
there is no reservation.

00:34:02.729 --> 00:34:03.650
That's it.

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:06.550
But if you call me up the last
minute, and it's a party of two

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:09.630
and it's not a party of 10, I'm
going to say yes, of course.

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:10.920
I mean, we try and do that.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:14.090
We always try to save a
table or two for regulars

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:15.315
that walk in and don't call.

00:34:15.315 --> 00:34:16.940
I mean, we always
ask everyone to call.

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:19.590
It's better for the table to
wait for you than the other way

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:20.451
around.

00:34:20.451 --> 00:34:21.909
And the last thing
you want to do--

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:24.949
and this is something that, if
I could change in this business,

00:34:24.949 --> 00:34:25.800
I would.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.533
It gets me crazy
when people get angry

00:34:27.533 --> 00:34:28.699
when you don't have a table.

00:34:28.699 --> 00:34:32.760
And I say, do you really think
I don't want your business?

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:38.004
I mean, I want to take care of
you, but where can I put you?

00:34:38.004 --> 00:34:39.420
There's no perfect
solution to it.

00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:42.969
But it's interesting when
a computer would tell you

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:45.578
that there's no table,
but somehow, you know,

00:34:45.578 --> 00:34:47.949
there's going to be a no
show on a Saturday night,

00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:48.850
something like that.

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:50.636
So that's a human
element, and that's

00:34:50.636 --> 00:34:53.670
where we would give
them just the ice cream.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:54.766
It would be no problem.

00:34:54.766 --> 00:34:56.724
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: We have
a question over here.

00:34:56.724 --> 00:34:57.688
AUDIENCE: Hi, Sal.

00:34:57.688 --> 00:34:58.170
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Hi.

00:34:58.170 --> 00:34:59.545
AUDIENCE: Thanks
for coming over.

00:34:59.545 --> 00:35:01.003
I just ate, and I'm still like--

00:35:01.003 --> 00:35:02.294
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Oh, thank you.

00:35:02.294 --> 00:35:03.976
Thank you so much.

00:35:03.976 --> 00:35:06.892
AUDIENCE: I would like your view
on-- there's sort of a trend

00:35:06.892 --> 00:35:09.750
nowadays about
modernist cuisine.

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:12.990
We often hear about
Massimo Bottura.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:14.880
We heard of this
Italian chef who

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.300
does a lot of things
about molecular food.

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:21.872
And it seems like people are
more and more into molecular,

00:35:21.872 --> 00:35:24.932
modernist, things
that go a little bit

00:35:24.932 --> 00:35:26.870
beyond traditional cuisine.

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:28.920
And from what I hear,
it sounds like you're

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.790
more passionate about bringing
all the traditions all together

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:33.540
and carry on this trend.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:35.370
So I'd like to get
your vision on that,

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:38.790
on how you see this coming
over for your restaurant,

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:41.228
maybe in terms of cuisine
overall in New York

00:35:41.228 --> 00:35:42.062
or in the world.

00:35:42.062 --> 00:35:43.770
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: That's
a great question.

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:45.869
You know, it's funny
is that we always

00:35:45.869 --> 00:35:47.910
say that we don't try and
be something we're not,

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:51.570
whether it's in life or in
terms of what our restaurant is.

00:35:51.570 --> 00:35:55.410
You know, if every place
is opening and serving

00:35:55.410 --> 00:35:59.074
Tuscan food, we're not going to
change the menu to suit that.

00:35:59.074 --> 00:36:01.240
I mean, like I said, we'll
make the different dishes

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:04.940
that people ask for, but we
try and do the one thing,

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.400
and the one thing just right.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.110
While on the other
hand, I think it's

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:13.200
wonderful to have other
things and new ideas.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:17.069
And I'm always open to them,
as long as they fit into it.

00:36:17.069 --> 00:36:19.360
And I don't know if it's just
our particular customers,

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.720
something as simple if
we change the bread,

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.190
like I try to get some
bread with the olives,

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:27.302
the olive loaves in there, and
some rosemary, steady customer,

00:36:27.302 --> 00:36:28.010
where's my bread?

00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:29.290
Where's my regular bread?

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:31.470
So you've got someone
coming in 25, 30 years,

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.640
you don't want to get
them upset about it.

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:36.710
And I tell you, the food
that I looked here today,

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:39.520
I'm just overwhelmed how much
food you have in this thing.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.500
I think, as much as
I'm already overweight,

00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:44.500
I think I'd be another 100
pounds if I worked here.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.130
But it's wonderful.

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:49.175
It's a great idea to
keep those things going.

00:36:49.175 --> 00:36:51.050
And different combinations
are all wonderful.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:52.940
My younger son is so good.

00:36:52.940 --> 00:36:54.780
He loves that show, Chopped.

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.530
And he could look
at those ingredients

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:58.830
and just figure something
out, where I don't know.

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:00.288
It just doesn't
work with my brain.

00:37:00.288 --> 00:37:03.247
But he can come up with
something really right away.

00:37:03.247 --> 00:37:04.080
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.480
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: Thank you.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.840
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: I wanted
to maybe get one more Sinatra

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:11.040
story out of you,
because I think

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:17.524
there's a moment where your dad
was very sensitive to an artist

00:37:17.524 --> 00:37:19.940
or performer who was kind of
down on his luck at the time.

00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:22.350
And something happened that
I think is a great story.

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:23.190
So maybe you could share that.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:24.760
I think you know which
one I'm talking about.

00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.593
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: This
was before I was born.

00:37:26.593 --> 00:37:28.200
It was the early '50s.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.680
And a lot of people don't
realize Frank Sinatra was down

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:31.270
on his luck.

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:32.580
I mean, he was
basically finished.

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:34.121
The industry thought
he was finished.

00:37:34.121 --> 00:37:35.525
He had lost his voice.

00:37:35.525 --> 00:37:38.020
He had lost the record contract.

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:39.510
Ava Gardner just
broke up with him.

00:37:39.510 --> 00:37:43.190
That was his love of his life.

00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:45.240
And he would come to the
restaurant by himself.

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:47.680
And he'd say to my grandfather,
Patsy, sit with me.

00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.200
I don't want to eat by myself.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.340
I don't want to be here.

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.190
He'd point to the other
customers and say,

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:54.340
these people are all my
fair weather friends.

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:56.840
They only come when the sun is
shining, when I'm doing good.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.710
These are the people that
would want to buy me a drink

00:37:58.710 --> 00:37:59.585
or pay for my dinner.

00:37:59.585 --> 00:38:00.649
Now they ignore me.

00:38:00.649 --> 00:38:02.940
And my grandfather always
used to reassure him and say,

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:05.327
Frank, you know, you'll
make a comeback someday.

00:38:05.327 --> 00:38:07.410
And this was right before
"From Here to Eternity,"

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:09.040
which was his comeback.

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.100
The next day was Thanksgiving.

00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.580
And to this day, we're still
closed on Thanksgiving.

00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.790
It's one of the few
holidays we're closed.

00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:19.016
And Frank Sinatra said to my
grandfather Patsy, he says,

00:38:19.016 --> 00:38:20.140
I want to come in tomorrow.

00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:22.060
Book me a table for one.

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.050
My grandfather had signs
up all over the place

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:24.930
that they're closed
the next day,

00:38:24.930 --> 00:38:26.650
but he didn't have
the heart to tell

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:28.480
Frank Sinatra they were closed.

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:30.480
And he would invite him
over to his house, which

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.380
he had been a million times.

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.050
And he says, OK,
Frank, no problem.

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:35.570
He took the signs down.

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:37.540
He told all the waiters.

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.972
He says, if it's possible,
can you come in tomorrow?

00:38:39.972 --> 00:38:41.430
And there was
moaning and groaning.

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:42.970
It's Thanksgiving.

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:44.480
He said, bring your family.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.610
It's for Frank Sinatra.

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:46.290
He's coming in.

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:48.380
I don't want him to
be here by himself.

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:49.520
And they did.

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.334
And the next day, he walked in.

00:38:51.334 --> 00:38:53.250
And you know, it's 3
o'clock in the afternoon.

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:54.920
Could you picture
this in the '50s?

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.800
Italian restaurant.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.550
And he says to my
grandfather, hey, Patsy,

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:59.490
it's a little quiet today.

00:38:59.490 --> 00:39:00.360
No one in the place.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.381
I mean, think about it.

00:39:01.381 --> 00:39:02.130
And he ate dinner.

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:04.713
And he found out later in life
that my grandfather opened just

00:39:04.713 --> 00:39:06.450
for him, and he never forgot it.

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:07.290
He never forgot it.

00:39:07.290 --> 00:39:09.010
He was very, very
loyal about that.

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:11.200
And he did make his comeback
when he did "From Here

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.640
to Eternity," and he
never went back down.

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:16.780
It was right to the moon.

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:17.485
All good stuff.

00:39:17.485 --> 00:39:18.110
All good stuff.

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:19.235
Very, very amazing.

00:39:19.235 --> 00:39:21.360
And these are the ones that
my father can remember.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:24.625
So got to get him to sit down
one day with my video camera

00:39:24.625 --> 00:39:26.900
and take some more
stories from him.

00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:29.570
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Well, Sal,
thank you for sharing with us.

00:39:29.570 --> 00:39:32.990
The cookbook is amazing,
Patsy's Italian Family Cookbook.

00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:34.680
I have both of them, of course.

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.980
And I encourage you to
go to Patsy's anytime.

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.370
Now you know you can
go at the last minute

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:41.645
and ask for Sal, right?

00:39:41.645 --> 00:39:42.770
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: You're in.

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:45.228
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: And there's
many, many, many, many, many,

00:39:45.228 --> 00:39:48.960
many more stories, from Frank,
to Ben Stiller and beyond,

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:49.627
and Buble.

00:39:49.627 --> 00:39:52.210
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: What's really
nice, though, about-- we didn't

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:53.910
get into too much
about the cookbooks--

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:57.330
is that, especially this one's
been out longer, the first one.

00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:58.770
Is that people use them.

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:02.004
They say to me, this book is
all dirty with sauce stains

00:40:02.004 --> 00:40:02.670
on it and stuff.

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:03.670
I'm using it.

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:06.550
And it's ingredients I know
and recipes I can make.

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:08.519
And I tell people,
don't be intimidated.

00:40:08.519 --> 00:40:10.810
I mean, you know, I made the
lasagna on Martha Stewart,

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:12.080
as I mentioned to you.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.620
And it's not difficult.
It's just time consuming.

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:16.380
You can do it.

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.950
It's not crazy ingredients.

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:20.920
It's stuff you probably
already have in your cabinet.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:23.230
And that's why I think
it's been a success.

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.684
And you know, it's really fun.

00:40:25.684 --> 00:40:26.350
It's really fun.

00:40:26.350 --> 00:40:27.430
I'm very lucky.

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:29.734
Every day, I wake up and
can't believe how lucky I am.

00:40:29.734 --> 00:40:31.150
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN:
Well, thank you.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:33.320
And I know you're going
to sign some books.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:34.040
SAL SCOGNAMILLO:
Oh, I'd love to.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:34.190
I'd love to.

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:35.110
That would be great.

00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:36.470
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: Obviously,
if you haven't already,

00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:38.350
check out Patsy's
on their website,

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:40.700
and on Facebook and
Twitter and Instagram.

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:41.540
SAL SCOGNAMILLO: All
those good things.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:42.680
MICHAEL KAUFFMAN: All the above.

00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:43.370
Sal, thank you.

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:44.290
SAL SCOGNAMILLO:
Thank you very much.

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:44.920
My pleasure.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.420
Pleasure.

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:46.970
