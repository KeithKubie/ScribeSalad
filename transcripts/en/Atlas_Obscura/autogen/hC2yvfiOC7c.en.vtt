did in fact revolve around the Sun and

did in fact revolve around the Sun and
 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.870
did in fact revolve around the Sun and
not the other way around and the church

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880
not the other way around and the church
 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.760

but just you got to represent both sides
 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.660
but just you got to represent both sides
of the argument so Galileo did this but

basically for the remainder of his life
 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.559
basically for the remainder of his life
but it doesn't mean that Galileo ever
