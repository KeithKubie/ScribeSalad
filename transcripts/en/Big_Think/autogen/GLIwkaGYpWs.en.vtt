00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.969
believe it or not a clock on your head

00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:05.979
believe it or not a clock on your head
 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:08.009
believe it or not a clock on your head
beats at a different rate than a clock

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:08.019
beats at a different rate than a clock
 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.640
beats at a different rate than a clock
on your foot we can now measure this and

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650
on your foot we can now measure this and
 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.089
on your foot we can now measure this and
it has practical importance as well

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099
it has practical importance as well
 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.460
it has practical importance as well
first of all I'm Stan said that time is

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:17.470
first of all I'm Stan said that time is
 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.000
first of all I'm Stan said that time is
a river so gigantic river we're all

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.010
a river so gigantic river we're all
 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.000
a river so gigantic river we're all
swept up in the river of time and it can

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010
swept up in the river of time and it can
 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.760
swept up in the river of time and it can
speed up and it slows down for example

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770
speed up and it slows down for example
 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.070
speed up and it slows down for example
on the moon did you know that time beats

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080
on the moon did you know that time beats
 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.230
on the moon did you know that time beats
faster on the moon than it does on the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240
faster on the moon than it does on the
 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.990
faster on the moon than it does on the
earth and we can measure this on Jupiter

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000
earth and we can measure this on Jupiter
 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.930
earth and we can measure this on Jupiter
time beats slower on Jupiter than it

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940
time beats slower on Jupiter than it
 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.450
time beats slower on Jupiter than it
does on the earth so time beats at

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460
does on the earth so time beats at
 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.130
does on the earth so time beats at
different rates when an object moves

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140
different rates when an object moves
 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.000
different rates when an object moves
very fast time slows down inside that

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010
very fast time slows down inside that
 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.939
very fast time slows down inside that
rocket that is moving very fast if that

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949
rocket that is moving very fast if that
 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.309
rocket that is moving very fast if that
rocket is then placed on the moon time

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:50.319
rocket is then placed on the moon time
 

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:52.889
rocket is then placed on the moon time
beats faster so we have two competing

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899
beats faster so we have two competing
 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.559
beats faster so we have two competing
effects this has a direct implication

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:55.569
effects this has a direct implication
 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:58.020
effects this has a direct implication
with regards to your cell phone your

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030
with regards to your cell phone your
 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.360
with regards to your cell phone your
cell phone has GPS which allows you to

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370
cell phone has GPS which allows you to
 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.520
cell phone has GPS which allows you to
locate objects on the planet Earth by

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530
locate objects on the planet Earth by
 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.430
locate objects on the planet Earth by
focusing in on satellites orbiting the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440
focusing in on satellites orbiting the
 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.730
focusing in on satellites orbiting the
planet earth satellites travel at 18,000

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740
planet earth satellites travel at 18,000
 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.170
planet earth satellites travel at 18,000
miles per hour if they're in low-earth

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180
miles per hour if they're in low-earth
 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.620
miles per hour if they're in low-earth
orbit therefore time slows down for

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630
orbit therefore time slows down for
 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.920
orbit therefore time slows down for
those low-lying satellites but if

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930
those low-lying satellites but if
 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.249
those low-lying satellites but if
satellites go farther and farther away

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
satellites go farther and farther away
 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.990
satellites go farther and farther away
gravity gets less and less and less so

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000
gravity gets less and less and less so
 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.719
gravity gets less and less and less so
time speeds up so we're not a space we

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729
time speeds up so we're not a space we
 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:26.700
time speeds up so we're not a space we
have two competing effects fast

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710
have two competing effects fast
 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.760
have two competing effects fast
satellites slow down in time very far

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770
satellites slow down in time very far
 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.249
satellites slow down in time very far
away satellites slow speed up in time

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259
away satellites slow speed up in time
 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.590
away satellites slow speed up in time
and in fact at one radius you can

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600
and in fact at one radius you can
 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.050
and in fact at one radius you can
calculate time beats exactly the same

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060
calculate time beats exactly the same
 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.569
calculate time beats exactly the same
rate as it does on the planet Earth so

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579
rate as it does on the planet Earth so
 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.120
rate as it does on the planet Earth so
what does it mean your GPS system would

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130
what does it mean your GPS system would
 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.209
what does it mean your GPS system would
totally fail without Einstein's theory

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219
totally fail without Einstein's theory
 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.240
totally fail without Einstein's theory
of special and general relativity this

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250
of special and general relativity this
 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.340
of special and general relativity this
also means that the top of your head

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350
also means that the top of your head
 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.260
also means that the top of your head
because it is farther from the center of

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270
because it is farther from the center of
 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.260
because it is farther from the center of
the earth beats at a faster rate time

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270
the earth beats at a faster rate time
 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.130
the earth beats at a faster rate time
beats at a faster rate than your feet so

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140
beats at a faster rate than your feet so
 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.899
beats at a faster rate than your feet so
you can actually show that even within

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909
you can actually show that even within
 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.359
you can actually show that even within
your own body now our instruments are so

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369
your own body now our instruments are so
 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.340
your own body now our instruments are so
accurate that you could show within your

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350
accurate that you could show within your
 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.919
accurate that you could show within your
own body the fact that time beats at

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929
own body the fact that time beats at
 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.490
own body the fact that time beats at
different rates within your own body

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500
different rates within your own body
 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.560
different rates within your own body
