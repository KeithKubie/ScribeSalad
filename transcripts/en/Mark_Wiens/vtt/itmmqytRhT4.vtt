00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.150
- Hey everyone, I hope you're having

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.480
an amazing day, it's Mark Weins.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.050
We just arrived to Curitiba,
which is in the south of Brazil

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.440
in the state of Parana, and
in this video we are gonna

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.200
explore Curitiba, we are going
to especially eat some of the

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.690
southern Brazilian dishes and
I'm gonna share all of the

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.413
southern Brazilian food
with you in this video.

00:00:20.413 --> 00:00:22.996
(upbeat music)

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:30.620
Guilherme, how are you man?

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.660
- [Guilherme] I'm doing fine man,

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.901
I'm very excited for Curitiba.

00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:34.199
- [Mark] What's the name of the dish

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:35.500
we're starting with first?

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.590
- Carne de Onca.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.423
- [Mark] Carne de Onca.

00:00:37.423 --> 00:00:38.256
- [Guilherme] Yes.

00:00:38.256 --> 00:00:41.120
- [Mark] Which translates exactly
to the meat of the jaguar.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.391
- Exactly.

00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:43.224
(people talking)

00:00:43.224 --> 00:00:44.930
- [Mark] Loving the
atmosphere of this restaurant.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.680
It's classic, the wooden
tables, the bar, the antiques,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.380
the Brazilian flag hanging
from the rafter from the roof.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.317
Yeah this is a cool spot.

00:00:54.317 --> 00:00:58.410
This just has a classic, just
like heritage feel to it.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.260
The owner was just explaining
to us that this used to be a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.288
corner like convenience shop,

00:01:03.288 --> 00:01:05.750
so they would sell,
you could come in here,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.478
you could get your small groceries,

00:01:07.478 --> 00:01:11.262
and then eventually it
became a restaurant.

00:01:11.262 --> 00:01:15.301
But the house, the property
itself dates back to 1953.

00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:16.884
(plates clinking on table)

00:01:16.884 --> 00:01:17.760
(mumbling)

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.593
Oh that's the meat.

00:01:18.593 --> 00:01:19.426
- [Guilherme] That's the meat.

00:01:19.426 --> 00:01:20.570
- [Mark] Oh it's so smooth I didn't even.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.410
The meat is such a fine mince
that it almost looked like a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.710
ball of like red pink dough,

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.683
but that's actually the minced beef.

00:01:30.184 --> 00:01:33.080
Oh, the smoothness of it, it's so fine.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.990
(talking in background)

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.980
What is this?

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.230
(mumbling)

00:01:43.872 --> 00:01:46.789
(percussion music)

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:55.256
(utensils scraping against plate)

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.210
Okay, so then first he
took that ball of meat,

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.410
he flattened it out,

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.140
he mixed in oh he
sprinkled on some cognac,

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.140
then some olive oil, salt,
some pepper, some chili powder,

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.580
there were some other spices,

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.270
some green onions went on there,
and the onions and garlic.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.897
He just mixed it perfectly
and evenly with the two spoons

00:02:21.897 --> 00:02:23.530
and served it with bread and some

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.930
mustards to go along with it.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.830
- Carne de Onca.

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.270
- [Mark] This is the jaguar meat.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.650
Of course it's not really
jaguar it's minced beef.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.180
Do you know the history
of how it got that name?

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.750
- [Guilherme] Raw meat, right?

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.583
- [Mark] Yeah

00:02:35.583 --> 00:02:38.670
- [Guilherme] So when, you know
the bad smell that comes out

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.781
of the jaguar mouth after
it eats like raw meat?

00:02:41.781 --> 00:02:43.450
- Uh-huh, meat breath.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.840
- So there's nothing
relating to the jaguar but

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.062
because after we eat it
gets kind of like a bad

00:02:50.062 --> 00:02:50.895
(laughing)

00:02:50.895 --> 00:02:54.184
- So we'll have jaguar
breath after we eat this

00:02:54.184 --> 00:02:55.290
- Breath, yes.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.270
- So we go bread.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:57.460
- [Guilherme] Yes.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.350
- [Mark] Butter, I'll use the knife.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.000
Butter goes down first.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.483
You want a good forkful onto the bread.

00:03:04.483 --> 00:03:06.983
(kid talking)

00:03:08.857 --> 00:03:11.100
You can see all the spices,
you can see the oil,

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.233
the cognac, oh and the mustard.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.486
Oh thank you.

00:03:16.486 --> 00:03:17.319
- [Guilherme] You're welcome

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.200
- [Mark] And that's black mustard?

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.033
- [Guilherme] Yes.

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:19.866
- Cheer's man.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:20.985
- Cheer's man.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.770
- Oh wow, what you immediately notice is

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.490
how fine the meat is.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:36.323
- [Guilherme] Yes.

00:03:36.323 --> 00:03:37.955
- [Mark] That's not like
a grind, that's like a,

00:03:37.955 --> 00:03:40.725
it is a grind but it's
so fine it's like smooth.

00:03:40.725 --> 00:03:42.780
It's absolutely awesome, you taste the

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.830
it's not like very very spiced,

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.604
but it really focuses on the meat.

00:03:48.604 --> 00:03:50.548
You taste that like
hint of cognac I think.

00:03:50.548 --> 00:03:51.381
- Yes

00:03:51.381 --> 00:03:52.630
- You taste the green onions.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.750
- The sweet paprika.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:54.775
- Yes, the sweet paprika.

00:03:54.775 --> 00:03:56.540
The onions like make it juicy I think.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.960
- [Guilherme] Exactly.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.543
(upbeat music)

00:04:05.848 --> 00:04:09.083
- [Mark] And then I will
add some of the hot sauce.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.190
And another thing I love is just how

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.877
you one bite that entire thing.

00:04:16.877 --> 00:04:19.460
(upbeat music)

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.759
it's so like neutral tasting actually.

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:30.759
The beef just has like
zero like overly meaty,

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.083
irony taste to it at all.

00:04:36.765 --> 00:04:39.478
(customers talking)

00:04:39.478 --> 00:04:42.190
Oh man as we're leaving the
restaurant has filled up,

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.150
it's packed now.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.780
That was incredibly delicious,

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.340
and we only had one dish because
we're gonna eat a lot more

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.822
food today in this southern
Brazilian food tour, but

00:04:51.822 --> 00:04:53.730
(breathes)

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:54.729
Success.

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:55.562
(walking)

00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:57.780
From here, we're going to
the next restaurant which is

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.760
walking distance and they are known

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.980
for their beef ribs
and this entire region,

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.130
this state of Brazil is
known for their meat.

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.030
Beef ribs coming up which
is one of the greatest meat

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.090
Okay, I can't wait.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.360
- They serve Costelao Do Gaucho.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.360
Costelao is like a big rack,
a huge rack of beef ribs.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.820
I'm already just loving the
atmosphere of this place.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.530
It's laid back, there's kind of like

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.610
almost picnic table style dining.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.297
It's busy, it's a family restaurant,

00:05:27.297 --> 00:05:28.770
we're going back to the kitchen and

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:30.900
the owner has said we can go back and

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.433
see them making the ribs.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.353
30 years.

00:05:36.353 --> 00:05:38.048
- [Guilherme] 30 years, yes.

00:05:38.048 --> 00:05:38.881
- [Mark] Oh I see him with the barbecue,

00:05:38.881 --> 00:05:40.213
and here comes another slab.

00:05:43.567 --> 00:05:46.095
(slapping)

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:48.345
(mumbling)

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.607
(talking)

00:05:53.881 --> 00:05:56.381
(saw squeaks)

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:03.370
And you can even hear the
crispiness of the skin.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.720
The skin so like crackling, crunchy skin.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.560
The owner has been making it for 30 years.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.630
He has this really unique slicing system.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:15.190
It literally is like a
woodworking table saw,

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.180
and he just takes that entire rack and

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.150
slices it into pieces, removes the bone.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.080
You can hear again the crispy
skin just like crackling under

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.640
that saw and then just like slices

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.160
it up expertly with that table saw.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.609
This is the most Brazilian
meat of your dreams.

00:06:31.609 --> 00:06:33.480
- [Guilherme] We gonna order the whole

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.373
thing which called the happiness combo.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.294
We're in Brazil baby,
let's eat some real ribs.

00:06:40.294 --> 00:06:41.239
(laughing)

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:44.989
(waiter speaking Portuguese)

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:48.480
- [Mark] He just brought
over some of the side dishes.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.510
The polenta, there's some
yucca which is a tapioca.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.404
There's some salad, potato salad,

00:06:54.404 --> 00:06:55.900
looks like some pickled onions,

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.020
some lettuce and some tomatoes and bread.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.690
That's all going to
accompany the main meat.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.368
- [Guilherme] This is the orange,

00:07:02.368 --> 00:07:05.535
so keep this to drink with the orange.

00:07:07.574 --> 00:07:09.270
- [Mark] This is a local Brazilian soda.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:11.350
Guarana is a fruit from the Amazon.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.900
This is the soda version of it.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.290
It's almost like a cream soda,

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.773
but like with a sour fruitiness.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.770
It's good, it's sweet, it is a soda.

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.780
I'm like, I mean I would
definitely prefer the real fruit

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:30.523
but that's interesting and refreshing.

00:07:31.465 --> 00:07:34.382
(excited cheering)

00:07:37.937 --> 00:07:40.520
(upbeat music)

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.660
I like how they serve
it on a chopping board.

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.860
You can just like chop it right on there.

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.910
The ribs are glistening
with fat and juices and

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.730
you can see how crispy that skin is.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.581
Unbelievable, all the side dishes.

00:07:53.581 --> 00:07:55.816
- [Guilherme] Yeah, like this.

00:07:55.816 --> 00:07:57.803
(speaking in Portuguese)

00:07:57.803 --> 00:07:59.653
- [Mark] Just go for the whole thing.

00:08:02.354 --> 00:08:05.140
Oh man, the onions, the
onions look amazing.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:06.993
Pickled red onions.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.920
Look at that skin, if you press it,

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.410
if you press it like that you can see

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.110
the juices actually like squirting.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:18.607
Oh, you've got to see that.

00:08:18.607 --> 00:08:21.190
(upbeat music)

00:08:24.725 --> 00:08:27.220
Okay I have to begin with that bite

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:29.110
right there with the skin.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:32.713
With the fat, oh wow.

00:08:34.690 --> 00:08:35.973
That is the first bite.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:48.320
Oh wow, that is so flavorful,
it's so smokey it's so tender.

00:08:51.855 --> 00:08:55.693
It's so salty, oh it is so good.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:06.180
All of the juices, the
juices in your mouth, wow.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.090
I can't wait to try this onion either.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.113
It's like a pickled red onion.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.310
Just slightly vinegary and very crisp.

00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:18.930
It's really wonderful
because it breaks up like

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:20.040
the fattiness of that meat.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.700
They serve it with some polenta,

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.743
which is like a cornmeal fritter.

00:09:28.294 --> 00:09:29.710
Oh it's excellent, it's like light,

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:33.844
it's really crispy and
kinda to get that semolina

00:09:33.844 --> 00:09:35.900
light and creaminess on the inside.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.473
With some yucca which is
the, these are casaba.

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:45.105
Very starchy, plain, but it's
like a plainness that goes

00:09:45.105 --> 00:09:47.350
so well with everything else,
I love it, I love yucca.

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:48.870
Just watch this the meat is so tender

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:49.810
you don't even need a knife,

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:53.080
you can just literally put
your fork in and just twirl.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.164
It's amazing.

00:09:54.164 --> 00:09:56.951
(upbeat music)

00:09:56.951 --> 00:09:58.868
Dude I like your style.

00:10:01.131 --> 00:10:03.610
I watched him over there
as he was vlogging.

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.590
He just picked up the entire piece.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.220
(laughs)

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.242
This is the way to do it.

00:10:09.242 --> 00:10:11.810
- The lizard mouth way.

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.536
That's my nickname here in Brazil.

00:10:13.536 --> 00:10:14.369
- Just like,

00:10:14.369 --> 00:10:16.452
(laughs)

00:10:21.713 --> 00:10:23.683
Very juicy, you can just pull it apart.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:26.313
This is like some chili oil.

00:10:28.282 --> 00:10:30.950
Let me add that half an onion.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.270
Okay a meat foundation bite.

00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.103
- There we go.

00:10:34.103 --> 00:10:34.936
- Cheers.

00:10:34.936 --> 00:10:35.769
- Cheers.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:40.800
- Break into the bread.

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:47.700
Absolutely awesome, amazing
food, amazing beef ribs.

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.700
And I just love this
restaurant, the owner,

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.067
the like character of this restaurant.

00:10:53.067 --> 00:10:55.940
The food is just insane.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:56.963
Insanely good.

00:10:57.883 --> 00:11:01.050
(speaking Portuguese)

00:11:04.846 --> 00:11:07.114
(laughs)

00:11:07.114 --> 00:11:09.197
This man, he is a legend.

00:11:10.358 --> 00:11:11.191
Obrigado

00:11:14.648 --> 00:11:16.978
The owner did not charge us for that meal,

00:11:16.978 --> 00:11:19.640
he does that with passion, with love.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.460
What a restaurant, what
a spot, what beef ribs.

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.291
That was incredible.

00:11:24.291 --> 00:11:26.874
(upbeat music)

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.010
Curitiba is located on the
high elevation plateau,

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:34.970
not too high elevation
but high enough so the

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:37.330
weather is cool, the air is so fresh.

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:40.260
It's like 24, 23 degrees today.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.738
Yeah, it's beautiful weather.

00:11:41.738 --> 00:11:44.153
(radio music)

00:11:44.153 --> 00:11:46.770
(Cars driving past car window)

00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.200
We drove over to 4 Beans.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.120
This is a coffee shop.

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:50.673
They're a roast coffee as well.

00:11:50.673 --> 00:11:53.161
They're one of the top roasters in Brazil,

00:11:53.161 --> 00:11:55.920
and we arrived here and they
just said that they're gonna

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.330
light up the roaster, they're
gonna fire up the roaster.

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.230
They're gonna roast some
coffee fresh for us and

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.209
then we're gonna have some coffee.

00:12:02.209 --> 00:12:04.792
(upbeat music)

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.078
Completely unplanned coffee experience.

00:12:18.078 --> 00:12:18.986
- [Guilherme] Yes.

00:12:18.986 --> 00:12:21.160
- [Mark] The owners are so nice.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.750
We have a chem ex going with
coffee brewing right here

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.140
and then we have some preparing the

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:28.313
green beans which she's gonna roast,

00:12:28.313 --> 00:12:31.233
which she's preheating
the roaster over there.

00:12:31.233 --> 00:12:33.816
(upbeat music)

00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:40.776
- We should drink at the same time.

00:12:40.776 --> 00:12:41.620
Very acid.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:44.960
- [Mark] Acid, but now
sour, and like sweet honey.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.370
That's like drinking fruit
juice, it's incredible.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.266
- Stop so you can see the
beans too, and then like

00:12:49.266 --> 00:12:50.957
- That would be awesome.

00:12:50.957 --> 00:12:53.887
(mumbling)

00:12:53.887 --> 00:12:56.804
(machine grinding)

00:12:58.882 --> 00:13:00.715
- Uh, fifteen minutes.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.680
- [Mark] You gotta keep tabs on everything

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.540
to roast perfect coffee.

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.493
Yeah we're just nerding
out on coffee right now.

00:13:17.974 --> 00:13:18.860
- This is a critical moment

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:22.571
- [Mark] A critical moment
okay, no distractions.

00:13:22.571 --> 00:13:25.404
(machine pouring)

00:13:33.696 --> 00:13:36.560
So we just opened up
this fresh tub of coffee.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.903
It just smells so fruity,
it's like a patch of flowers.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.273
Whoa, that is amazing.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.686
Slightly bitter, chocolatey, crunchy.

00:13:51.686 --> 00:13:55.076
(upbeat music)

00:13:55.076 --> 00:13:57.510
Okay, next up on this Curitiba food tour.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:14:00.590
We've just arrived to a
local little hole in the wall

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:03.040
restaurant that's famous for
serving a sandwich called a

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:03.873
lombado.

00:14:03.873 --> 00:14:07.843
They have a five kilo lombado
but after we had that lunch,

00:14:07.843 --> 00:14:10.290
those beef ribs, I don't know if we're up

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.560
for a challenge for a five kilo sandwich.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.100
So we might just go for the regular size.

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.727
But this is the spot, it looks very cool.

00:14:16.727 --> 00:14:17.618
(laughs)

00:14:17.618 --> 00:14:18.451
What?

00:14:18.451 --> 00:14:23.379
- Five kilos. Let's have the five kilos.

00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:27.770
Let's have the five kilos please.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.830
The other one is only 1.5 kilos.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.740
- [Mark] Oh, can we see them make it?

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:36.130
Okay, on second thought,
Guilherme has made the executive

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.510
decision that we need
to have the five kilo.

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.493
- [Guilherme] Yeah,
that's only five kilo man.

00:14:40.493 --> 00:14:41.326
- Yeah, let's go with the five kilo.

00:14:41.326 --> 00:14:42.409
- Yeah.

00:14:42.409 --> 00:14:45.109
- Let's go to the five kilo.

00:14:45.109 --> 00:14:47.402
- We're gonna do the five kilo.

00:14:47.402 --> 00:14:50.308
- [Guilherme] Five kilo man.

00:14:50.308 --> 00:14:51.250
- We're going in, we're going in.

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:56.250
- If we're not at *, man lovely guy.

00:14:58.083 --> 00:15:00.893
(kitchen employees talking)

00:15:00.893 --> 00:15:03.643
(grill sizzling)

00:15:09.629 --> 00:15:14.629
- [Mark] I understand what he's saying.

00:15:18.828 --> 00:15:22.578
(chef talking in Portuguese)

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:44.510
- He piled everything into the
bun, starting with the hotdog

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.890
then the burgers, then
the chicken mixture,

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:48.290
then that cheese mixture.

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:50.853
There's a white cheese,
there's a cheddar cheese.

00:15:50.853 --> 00:15:53.410
It almost looks like a squeezable hotdog

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.150
that just like goes on top of it.

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:59.770
Then, he puts on some tomatoes
to balance out that protein,

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:02.820
and then he adds on some
fried eggs, then some lettuce.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.060
I forgot a key ingredient,

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.410
half a bucket of mayonnaise
goes onto your bun.

00:16:14.868 --> 00:16:15.951
Oh it closes.

00:16:21.152 --> 00:16:23.652
Oh my gosh it looks beautiful.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.320
And then he puts it like
literally into a pizza box.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.900
This is not just like a food challenge,

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.440
this is just like a family
Saturday night dinner.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.590
The whole family can enjoy and

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:43.348
he just slices it into like pie slices.

00:16:43.348 --> 00:16:44.278
(laughs)

00:16:44.278 --> 00:16:45.111
Wow.

00:16:47.134 --> 00:16:50.717
(server speaks Portuguese)

00:16:55.183 --> 00:16:57.000
Look at the cross section.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.237
There's so much chicken and meat in there.

00:16:59.237 --> 00:17:03.322
And cheese, there has to
be like a kilo of cheese.

00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:06.533
- [Guilherme] Yeah and
two kilos of chicken.

00:17:08.493 --> 00:17:11.750
- [Mark] There's a hotdog
protruding out of this piece.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:15.370
You have to actually like put
your palm underneath this.

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:16.648
You have to support it.

00:17:16.648 --> 00:17:18.890
(laughs)

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:20.550
Oh it's so hot.

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:22.280
Oh I lost some at the front.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.435
Oh wow, that's.

00:17:23.435 --> 00:17:25.363
- Grab the top.

00:17:25.363 --> 00:17:28.410
- Grab the top, it's flaming
hot, I'm gonna use that piece

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:33.410
of lettuce to scrape out
and stuff it back in.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:37.520
The cheese, the chicken, the hotdog,

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.760
I have a protruding hotdog,
the burgers, the egg.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:43.050
Oh wow, okay, cheers.

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:43.899
- Cheers.

00:17:43.899 --> 00:17:46.482
(upbeat music)

00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:55.598
It's actually awesomely good.

00:17:55.598 --> 00:17:57.893
Just like so much cheese.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.764
You really taste the hotdog,
you really taste the burger.

00:18:04.764 --> 00:18:06.854
(laughs)

00:18:06.854 --> 00:18:09.854
(Guilherme talking)

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.697
It's stuck to my fingers.

00:18:12.697 --> 00:18:14.348
(talking)

00:18:14.348 --> 00:18:15.460
(laughing)

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.033
No, like plastic bags of cheese,

00:18:18.033 --> 00:18:21.569
they're just completely
melted into everything.

00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:25.620
The shredded chicken has
like a crusty, crunchy edge.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.423
You get the saltiness of the hotdog.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:29.780
I know there's burger in there,

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:31.690
but I haven't even tasted the burger yet.

00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:34.330
The edge is just like oozing around,

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.870
and then all of a sudden you
hit the refreshing taste of the

00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:39.833
lettuce and the tomato to
balance everything of course.

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:45.580
You can imagine yourself
just lounging on the couch

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.573
just finishing an entire 5 kg lombado.

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:51.423
It's actually really good though.

00:18:51.423 --> 00:18:52.380
- [Guilherme] It's very good.

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.400
- Let's explore the sauces,

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.400
I think I'm going with the mustard.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.920
- Oh, that's like transparent yellow.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.820
I don't know if that's mustard or not.

00:19:03.965 --> 00:19:06.270
I think it's like a sweet mustard.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:07.663
Oh, the end of a hotdog.

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:10.250
Oh, thank you.

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:11.407
Oh, awesome.

00:19:11.407 --> 00:19:13.148
That is gonna be key.

00:19:13.148 --> 00:19:15.200
That is gonna be a key bite right there.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.330
And you can see in this bite
there's gonna be all that

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:20.863
chili, plus burger, plus hotdog, plus egg.

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:28.930
So far in Brazil I've just been

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:30.880
loving the different chili sauces.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.460
The actual food is not that spicy but

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.450
they always have chili sauce
which is just unbelievable.

00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:38.780
And this is an amazing
one, the mix of chilis.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.730
This chili sauce, oh no I lost it.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.720
Okay let me put it back on there.

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.720
This chili sauce really makes it though.

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.813
Okay, I'm moving in for my
second piece here of the lombado.

00:19:57.750 --> 00:20:00.270
This thing is mega-normous.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.290
It's beyond huge.

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.000
- Good job.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.160
- This is like it's
actually very very tasty,

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.500
the mix of meats,

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:10.575
the saltiness all combined
with the chili sauce,

00:20:10.575 --> 00:20:14.480
this is like this will make you just

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.130
stop for the rest of the evening.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.450
What a place, this is
like a community hangout.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:19.840
Not only is it a restaurant,

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.820
Yeah this is a community hangout.

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:26.820
And man, I love the people,
I love how he started as a

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:31.870
street food cart outside of a speed bump

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:35.180
and now this is what
he has turned it into.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.430
A restaurant where literally like

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:42.430
the five kilo family platter lombado.

00:20:42.561 --> 00:20:45.260
It's just like flying out of the kitchen.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.220
He's making one after
another, after another,

00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:48.580
after another, after
another, and just like

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.083
boxing them and they're
like going out the door.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:54.750
Oh yeah, there's one right there.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.347
(rain dripping)

00:20:59.745 --> 00:21:01.060
(cars driving through puddles)

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:03.860
One more stop today to
finish this food tour.

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:05.310
It's called Uncle Dog.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:08.721
It's like a bit of a giant hotdog.

00:21:08.721 --> 00:21:10.888
(talking)

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:14.380
Being able to stand here
on the corner and making it

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:15.213
it is really cool.

00:21:15.213 --> 00:21:17.458
They like pack in the
ingredients, and there's like

00:21:17.458 --> 00:21:22.458
tomatoes, and corn and the
little crispy shoestring fries.

00:21:23.973 --> 00:21:27.220
I mean, literally folds it
in and packs it in with his

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.810
spatula before flattening it down.

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:32.030
It's a lot of things
going on in that hotdog,

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:33.445
that's for sure.

00:21:33.445 --> 00:21:35.612
(talking)

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:00.210
He's using a trowel to make that,

00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:01.870
to fit everything in that bun.

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:04.820
And we're gonna order
one of the Philadelphia.

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:06.907
I think it's one of their top sellers.

00:22:06.907 --> 00:22:09.074
(talking)

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.439
Oh yeah look at that cross section.

00:22:12.439 --> 00:22:15.800
The squeezable cheese are all in there.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.640
The mayonnaise, the hotdog
on both sides of the bread.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:23.080
The little shoestring fries
and the tomato mixture.

00:22:30.386 --> 00:22:31.824
That ones pretty good.

00:22:31.824 --> 00:22:36.824
Like a sweet corn, the
creamy like liquid cheese.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:41.250
The crunch of the fries
and just the heat of it.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:43.831
This is a definitely a 2 A.M. food.

00:22:43.831 --> 00:22:45.998
(talking)

00:22:48.014 --> 00:22:49.371
- So what do you think about the taste?

00:22:49.371 --> 00:22:50.204
Pretty good?

00:22:50.204 --> 00:22:51.037
- Definitely good.

00:22:51.037 --> 00:22:52.220
- Nice.

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.430
- Different and definitely good.

00:22:56.266 --> 00:23:00.360
- My grandpa starts this, all of this.

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.580
- So it's part of your family.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:02.413
- Yeah.

00:23:02.413 --> 00:23:03.246
- Wow very cool.

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:07.453
- Last bite.

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:09.783
- [Mark] Nice.

00:23:11.263 --> 00:23:13.513
(cheering)

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.860
- [Mark] The entire crew here
at Tio Dog is so awesome,

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:23.420
they're so friendly, they're
having a good time out here

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.540
making the tio dogs,
making the Philadelphia.

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:29.820
Yeah, what I love most
about this is the atmosphere

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:31.875
and just hanging out
with this crew of guys.

00:23:31.875 --> 00:23:34.930

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:39.962
It has been a very interesting,
very unique food day.

00:23:39.962 --> 00:23:43.157
