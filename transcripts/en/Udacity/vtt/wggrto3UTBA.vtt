00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.520
Sophisticated analysis of genomic DNA can provide insight

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.680
into individual's ancestry. But most nuclear DNA undergoes

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.600
a recombination over successive generations. And therefore patterns

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.740
of ancestry decay more quickly in these regions.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.070
To look back into our deeper past, we

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.070
need to look at DNA sequence information that's

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.830
directly inherited and not involved in meiotic recombination.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.610
In this diagram here of all the human

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.770
chromosomes, I want you to tell me which two chromosomes do not

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.220
experience significant recombination over many generations.

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.920
There's a checkbox associated with each chromosome

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.370
1 through 22, the X to Y and mitochondrial chromosome. I want

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.396
you to pick the two that

00:00:40.396 --> 00:00:43.746
don't experience significant recombination over many generations.
