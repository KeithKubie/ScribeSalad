second thing is that if the asteroid

second thing is that if the asteroid
 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.970
second thing is that if the asteroid
were absolutely hitting the earth we

not we should take action or not the
 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.510

real issue is not whether we can prove

for sure but we only get to do this

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270
for sure but we only get to do this
 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.069
for sure but we only get to do this
experiment once and if we get into a

anything about changing it back to where
