00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
In the last video, we learned a
little bit about the circle.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.350
And the circle is really just
a special case of an ellipse.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.220
It's a special case because in
a circle you're always an equal

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.420
distance away from the center
of the circle, while in an

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.730
ellipse, the distance from the
center of the circle

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.110
is always changing.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:21.820
You know what an
ellipse looks like.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.300
Well, I showed you that
in the first video.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.020
It looks something like that.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.140
What I mean is that the radius
or the distance from the

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.360
center is always changing.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.630
Let me say this is
centered at the origin.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.190
So that's the origin
right there.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.440
You see here, we're really, if
we're on this point on the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.010
ellipse, we're really
close to the origin.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.110
This is actually the closest
we'll ever get, just as close

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.520
as well get down here.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.540
And when we're out here we're
really far away from the origin

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.650
and that's about as far as
we're going to get right there.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.400
So a circle is a special case
of this, because in a circle's

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.770
case, the furthest we get from
the origin is the same distance

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.670
as the closest we get, or, in
other words, we are always

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.190
the exact same distance
away from the origin.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.240
Well, with that said, let's
actually go a little

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.070
bit into the math.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.640
So the general or the standard
form for an ellipse centered at

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.120
the origin is x squared over a
squared plus y squared over

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.170
b squared is equal to 1.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.040
Where a and b are just
any two numbers.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.170
I could have written this as
c squared and d squared.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.920
I mean, they're just
place holders.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.430
Just to give you an idea of
what this means, if this was

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.180
our ellipse in question right
now, a is the length of the

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.330
radius in the x-direction.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.030
Remember, we're going to
have a squared down here.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.760
So if you took the square
root of whatever is in the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.130
denominator, a is the x-radius.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.260
So this distance in our little
chart right here, in our little

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.700
graph here, that distance is a,
or that this point right here,

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.200
since we're centered at the
origin, will be the point x is

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.160
equal to a y is equal to 0.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.050
And of course this point right
here this will be a, so this

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.620
would be the point
minus a comma 0.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.320
And then the radius in the
y-direction would be this

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.860
radius right here and is b.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.430
So this point would be x is
equal to 0, y is equal to b.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.720
Likewise this point right here
would be x is equal to 0,

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.010
y is equal to minus b.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.730
And the way I drew this, we
have kind of a short and fat

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.090
ellipse you can also have kind
of a tall and skinny ellipse.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.600
But in the short and fat
ellipse, the direction that

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.710
you're short in that's
called your minor axis.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.010
And so b, I always forget the
exact terminology, but b you

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.125
can call it your semi or the
length of your semi-minor axis.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.120
And where did that
word come from?

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.660
Well if this whole thing is
your minor axis or maybe you

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.820
could call your minor diameter
if this whole thing is your

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.850
minor diameter it's called
minor, because it's the

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.470
shortest of all of the
diameters of this ellipse.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.210
And then the semi
is half of that.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.840
b is the length of
the semi-minor axis.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.650
That's b in this example, just
because as I drew this ellipse

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.450
it just happens to be that
b is smaller then a.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.860
If b was larger than a, I would
have a tall and skinny ellipse.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.830
Let me actually draw one.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.100
It could have been like this.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.550
I could have an ellipse that
looks something like that.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.190
In which case, all of a sudden
b would be the semi-major axis,

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.710
because b would be
greater than a.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.440
That this would be
taller than it is wide.

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.640
But let me not confuse
the graph too much.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.860
And in this case, a is the
length of-- I think you've

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:03.520
guessed it-- a is the length of
the semi-major axis or you can

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.210
even call it the length
of the major radius.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.460
I think that makes more sense.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.220
And you can call this
the minor radius.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.360
So let's just do an example.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.120
And I think when I've done an
example with actual numbers,

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.250
it'll make it all a
little bit clearer.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.510
So let's say I were to show up
at your door with the

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:39.580
following: If I were to say x
squared over 9 plus y squared

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:44.800
over 25 is equal to 1.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.350
So what is your radius
in the x-direction?

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:51.050
This is your radius in
the x-direction squared.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.002
So your radius in the
x-direction if we just map

00:04:53.002 --> 00:04:56.030
it, we would say that
a is equal to 3.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.690
Because this is a squared.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.260
And if we were just map it we'd
say this is b squared than this

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.930
tells us that b is equal to 5.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.830
So if we wanted to graph
this, and once again this

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.500
is centered at the origin.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.840
Let me draw the ellipse first.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.810
So, first of all, we have our
radius in the y-direction is

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.140
larger than our radius
in the x-direction.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.320
The ellipse is going to
be taller and skinnier.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.170
It's going to look
something like that.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.060
Draw some axes, so that could
be your x-axis, your y-axis.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.260
This is your radius
in the y-direction.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.060
So this distance right here
is going to be 5, and

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.030
so will this distance.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:43.960
And this is your radius
in the x-direction.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.310
So this will be 3,
and this will be 3.

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.990
That's it.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.170
You have now plotted
this ellipse.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:53.530
Nothing too fancy about it.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.720
And actually just to kind of
hit the point home that the

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.720
circle is a special
case of an ellipse.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.720
We learned in the last video
that the equation of a circle

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.900
is x squared and a circle
centered at the origin.

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.320
x squared plus y squared
is equal to r squared.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.350
So if we were to divide both
sides of this by r squared, we

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.290
would get-- and this is just
little algebraic manipulation--

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:26.510
x squared over r squared plus y
squared over r squared

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:28.430
is equal to 1.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:33.940
Now in this case, your a
is r and so is your b.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.860
So your semi-minor axis
is r and so is your

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.600
semi-major axis of r.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.500
Or, in other words, this
distance is the same as that

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.200
distance, and so it will
neither be short and fat

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.350
nor tall and skinny.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.710
It'll be perfectly round.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:51.750
And so that's why the circle is
a special case of an ellipse.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:54.740
So let me give you a slightly--
It'll look a lot more

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.770
complicated, and this is
something you might

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:57.600
see on exam.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.980
But I just want to show you
that this is just a shifting.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:06.960
Let's say we wanted to
shift this ellipse.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.990
Let's say we wanted to shift
it to the right by 5.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:19.040
So instead of the origin being
at x is equal to 0, the origin

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.550
will now be at x is equal 5.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:27.620
So a way to think about that is
what does this term have to be

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:32.340
so that at 5 this term
ends up being 0.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.780
Well I'll actually draw it
for you, because I think

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:34.920
that might be confusing.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.170
So if we shift that over the
right by 5, the new equation of

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:49.950
this ellipse will be x minus 5
squared over 9 plus y squared

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.600
over 25 is equal to 1.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.460
So if I were to just draw
this ellipse right now,

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.850
it would look like this.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.290
I want to make it look
fairly similar to the

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.500
ellipse I had before.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.530
It would look just like that.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:07.180
Just shifted it over by five.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.170
And the intuition we learned a
little bit in the circle video

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.240
where I said, oh well, you
know, if you have x minus

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.120
something that means that the
new origin is now

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.680
at positive 5.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.010
And you could memorize that.

00:08:18.010 --> 00:08:19.580
You could always say, oh, if I
have a minus here, that the

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:23.880
origin is at the negative of
whatever this number is, so

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.570
it would be a positive five.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.420
You know, if you had a positive
it would be the opposite that.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.950
But the way to really think
about it is now if you go to x

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:37.490
is equal to 5, when x is equal
to 5, this whole term, x minus

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:41.550
5, will behave just like
this x term will here.

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:47.100
When x is equal to 5 this
term is 0, just like

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.910
when x was 0 here.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.750
So when x is equal to 5, this
term is 0, and then y squared

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:56.290
over 25 is equal 1, so y
has to be equal five.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.470
Just like over here when x is
equal is 0, y squared over 25

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.930
had to be equal to 1,
y is equal to either

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:04.690
positive or minus 5.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:06.550
And I really want to give
you that intuition.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.970
And then, let's say we
wanted to shift this

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.780
equation down by two.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.250
So our new ellipse looks
something like this.

00:09:20.530 --> 00:09:22.310
A lot of times you learned
this in conic sections.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:23.880
But this is true any function.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.960
When you shift things,
you shift it this way.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:31.340
If you shift this graph to the
right by five, you replace all

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.010
of the x's with x minus 5.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:38.860
And if you were to shift it
down by two, you would replace

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:44.780
all the y's with y plus 2.

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.610
So let me draw our new
ellipse first, just to

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:47.580
show you what I'm doing.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:59.170
So our new ellipse is going
to look something like that.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:03.050
I'm shifting the yellow
ellipse down by two.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:08.310
So this equation, if I shift it
down, well, the x is still

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:16.160
where it was before. x minus 5
squared over 9 plus y plus 2

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.050
squared over 25 is equal to 1.

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:23.840
And once again, the reason I
know this is because now when

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:29.180
y is minus 2, this
whole term is 0.

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.040
0 when y equals minus 2.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.370
And when this term is 0, it
behaves the same way as

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:36.200
when this term was 0.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.400
So when y is equal to minus 2,
you get the same behavior,

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:45.560
you're at the same point in the
curve, right here actually, as

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.770
you are when y equaled 0
in this one, so here.

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:50.050
So it's not the same point.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.880
You can kind of view it as the
same part of the ellipse.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.960
You're at kind of the maximum
width point on the ellipse here

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:01.650
and here when y is equal to 2,
and you were here at y equal to

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:04.530
0-- sorry, when y
equals minus 2.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:05.540
This is minus 2.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.390
And that's because when you
put y equals minus 2 here

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.980
this whole term is 0.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.490
Just like when y was 0 here.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.130
I don't want to make
it too confusing.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:16.350
But just to kind of wrap it all
up, sometimes you might see

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:24.490
something like graph the
following: y minus 1 squared

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:33.430
over 4 plus x plus 2 squared
over 9 is equal to 1.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.760
And so the first thing you
could say is OK this is just

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:42.410
like the standard ellipse y
squared over 4 plus x squared

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.040
over 9 is equal to one.

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.040
It's just like this,
but it's shifted over.

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:55.170
This ones origin is 0,0, while
this ones origin would be what?

00:11:55.170 --> 00:12:01.170
It would be the point x
is minus 2 and y is 1.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:06.110
So if you were to graph
this, your radius in

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.680
your y-direction is 2.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.000
2 squared is equal to 4.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.590
Your radius in your
x-direction is 3.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.900
3 squared is equal to 9.

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:18.870
So your x-radius is actually
larger than your y-radius.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:22.860
So, it's going to be a little
bit of a fat ellipse.

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.265
Actually, let me draw
the axes first.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.290
Let me draw it like this.

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:38.120
That's my vertical axis,
this is my x-axis.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.450
And so my center is
now at minus 2, 1.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:49.040
That's minus 2,
and I go up one.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.830
That's the center
of my ellipse.

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:54.560
And now in the x-direction,
this is the x term,

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.850
my x-radius is 3.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:03.780
So the ellipse will go
three-- in that direction.

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:07.210
This is it's widest point
will be 3 in that direction.

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:10.700
And then in the y-direction,
it'll go 2, so it'll go up

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:15.030
1, 2 so that's there and
then 1, 2 and it's there.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.140
So if I were to draw that
ellipse it would look something

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.770
like this through my best shot.

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:27.170
A little bit fatter than it
is tall, and that's because

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:30.590
your x-radius is larger
than your y-radius.

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:35.440
This distance right here is 3,
this distance right here is 3,

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:41.530
this distance right here is 2,
this distance right here is 2.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:42.950
You could figure out
what these points are.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:45.590
I won't do all of them right
now just for the sake of time.

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.410
But this right here is
the point minus 2, 1.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.810
So if you go three more than
that-- so if you add 3 to

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:57.730
the x-direction this is
the point 1 comma 1.

00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.445
If you would take three away
from the x-direction, this

00:13:59.445 --> 00:14:00.740
would be minus 5 comma 1.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.260
And you could figure
out the other points.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.900
That might be good
exercise for you.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.910
Anyway that's a little
bit on ellipses.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:07.970
In future videos we'll do
really hairy problems where you

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:11.480
have to simplify it into this
form so that we know that it

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.550
definitely is an ellipse.
