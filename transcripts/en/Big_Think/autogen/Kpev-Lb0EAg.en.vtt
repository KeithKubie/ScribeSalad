differently there's no question about

differently there's no question about
 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.230
differently there's no question about
that and we have a fair understanding

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240
that and we have a fair understanding
 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.720
that and we have a fair understanding
actually of what is happening at least

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730
actually of what is happening at least
 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.880
actually of what is happening at least
at the individual level my sense is that

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890
at the individual level my sense is that
 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.340
at the individual level my sense is that
we have explored a lot of what is

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350
we have explored a lot of what is
 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.779
we have explored a lot of what is
happening I wouldn't say there's going

happening I wouldn't say there's going
 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.759

to be no further progress but we've

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769
to be no further progress but we've
 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.130
to be no further progress but we've
explored along the major tendencies well

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140
explored along the major tendencies well
 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.850
explored along the major tendencies well
the major tendencies of people tend to

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860
the major tendencies of people tend to
 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.209
the major tendencies of people tend to
frame things very narrowly they take a

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219
frame things very narrowly they take a
 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.369
frame things very narrowly they take a
narrow view of decision makings they

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379
narrow view of decision makings they
 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.470
narrow view of decision makings they
look at the problem at hand and they

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480
look at the problem at hand and they
 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.299
look at the problem at hand and they
deal with it as if it were the only

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309
deal with it as if it were the only
 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.610
deal with it as if it were the only
problem very frequently it's a better

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620
problem very frequently it's a better
 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.819
problem very frequently it's a better
idea to look at problems as they will

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829
idea to look at problems as they will
 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.279
idea to look at problems as they will
recur throughout your life and then you

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289
recur throughout your life and then you
 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.260
recur throughout your life and then you
look at the policy that you're to adopt

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
look at the policy that you're to adopt
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.779
look at the policy that you're to adopt
for a class of problems difficult to do

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789
for a class of problems difficult to do
 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.139
for a class of problems difficult to do
would be a better thing people who frame

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149
would be a better thing people who frame
 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.170
would be a better thing people who frame
things narrowly in the sense for example

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180
things narrowly in the sense for example
 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.010
things narrowly in the sense for example
that they will save and and borrow at

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.530
that they will save and and borrow at

as as one thing if people were able to

general make better decisions so that is
 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.630

certainly one one of the weaknesses of

certainly one one of the weaknesses of
 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.539
certainly one one of the weaknesses of

framing mental accounting you know is is
 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.929

a big deal this is the way that we live

have different rules so people will will

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950
have different rules so people will will

well of course they spend their spending

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049
well of course they spend their spending
 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.130
well of course they spend their spending
money but then there is a hierarchy of

money but then there is a hierarchy of

each stock that they buy as a mental

each stock that they buy as a mental
 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.110
each stock that they buy as a mental
account and they want to sell it when it

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120
account and they want to sell it when it
 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.440
account and they want to sell it when it
is a winner and so they tend to sell

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450
is a winner and so they tend to sell
 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.350
is a winner and so they tend to sell
their winners and and just hang on to

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360
their winners and and just hang on to
 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.960
their winners and and just hang on to
their losers in their portfolio and that

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970
their losers in their portfolio and that
 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.280
their losers in their portfolio and that
turns out to make them substantially

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290
turns out to make them substantially
 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.320
turns out to make them substantially

hazy idea of compound interest
 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.300

and it's very detrimental so I would say

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310
and it's very detrimental so I would say

to frame things broadly I mean that's it

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790
to frame things broadly I mean that's it

frequently goes with numeracy but it's

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070
frequently goes with numeracy but it's
 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.550
frequently goes with numeracy but it's
not quite the same thing and then by

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560
not quite the same thing and then by
 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.949
not quite the same thing and then by
taking the broad view it is very

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959
taking the broad view it is very

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650
emotional reactions to events and what I
 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.699
emotional reactions to events and what I
mean by that is that most of us tend to

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709
mean by that is that most of us tend to
 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.340
mean by that is that most of us tend to

you're better off if you frame things
 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.670
you're better off if you frame things
broadly and you think of you win a few

emotional response to small gains and do
small losses that tends to induce better
