- I just want things to go
 back to how they were, Vinny,

00:06:18.777 --> 00:06:20.079
before I broke your turntable.

00:06:20.112 --> 00:06:21.013
- What?

00:06:21.046 --> 00:06:22.381
- You said you needed me, Vinny.

00:06:22.414 --> 00:06:24.850
That's all I've
 ever wanted to hear.

00:06:24.883 --> 00:06:27.052
I just want things to go
  back to the way they were.

00:06:27.085 --> 00:06:28.320
You're my best friend.

00:06:28.353 --> 00:06:29.589
- Well Colonel,

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:32.224
I don't know what to say.

00:06:32.257 --> 00:06:35.161
That's all I want too, man.

00:06:35.194 --> 00:06:37.563
- I'll bet you do,
  ya piece of shit!

00:06:37.596 --> 00:06:39.866
(flatline)
