MIKKI METTEBA: Being
at Princeton University

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.450
is really exciting, especially
when I'm walking places,

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.510
and I know that there have been
indigenous people before me who

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.650
have walked there too.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.190
And knowing that I'm able
to reclaim those spaces,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.260
it's empowering.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.330
CARMEN LOPEZ: Our goal
at College Horizons

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.990
is to increase the number
of Native Americans

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.119
that are accessing
higher education

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.510
both in the undergraduate
admission process

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.810
and in the graduate and
professional school.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.450
KEVIN HUDSON: The Admission
Office here at Princeton

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.550
was instrumental in bringing
College Horizons to campus

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.380
this summer.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.740
College Horizons
is a great partner

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.810
as we think about
the role that we

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.010
can play in increasing
the number of students,

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.890
Native American students
and lower-income students,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.835
that consider Princeton
as an option.

00:00:59.835 --> 00:01:01.210
MIKAELA CRANK
THINN: Students get

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.810
to really have that
first on experience

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.870
with living in the dorms, being
in these classroom spaces,

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.450
utilizing the campus, and kind
of having that impact of what

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.060
it might be like
to be at a place

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.160
like Princeton or any
other institution.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.160
KEVIN HUDSON: The reason
why that's so important

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.580
is because oftentimes
students don't see Princeton

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.610
as a school that's theirs,
that could be their home.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.100
And by getting students
here over the summer

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.800
to be exposed to the campus,
to meet administrators,

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.520
to meet faculty, and to
leverage the opportunity

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.420
to be on campus,

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.000
it lets more students
know that Princeton

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.540
can be an option for
them and a home for them.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.810
JEFFREY FIFE JR.: We are the
leaders of today and tomorrow.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.290
So Native youth have such an
important role in the community

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.100
by taking initiatives that some
others wouldn't necessarily

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.700
take.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.180
I believe that if we lead
the way in higher education,

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.280
others will follow.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.950
KEVIN HUDSON: I was
participating in a college

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.880
fair, and a student
ran out and asked

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.380
to hug, it was
actually the director,

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.580
and share the joy he felt
because he had found his 15

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.100
dream colleges.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.740
And to see the joy on his
face is the type of experience

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.690
that we want College
Horizons students

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.030
to have and to take
away and bring back

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.232
to their communities.

00:02:24.232 --> 00:02:26.440
MIKAELA CRANK THINN: We want
to make college relevant

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.640
for our students.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.330
We want them to know that
colleges is not necessarily

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.675
just the name or
necessarily about, you know,

00:02:34.675 --> 00:02:37.840
what the colleges offer,
but what our students

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.407
can offer to those colleges.

00:02:40.407 --> 00:02:41.740
JEFFREY FIFE JR.: They're driven.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.510
That's what Native youth are.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.740
We are driven.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.060
And I believe we will change
the world in many ways.
