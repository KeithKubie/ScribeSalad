00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.850
GURUPIAH MURSIB: The conformity
of contemporary architecture

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.690
worldwide and the inherent
loss of local identities

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.250
is a paradox of the century.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.140
Hello.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.290
My name is Gurupiah, and I'm
from the MIT-UTM Malaysia

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.400
Sustainable Cities Program.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.690
In this video, I'll be
presenting the significance

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.120
of local involvement
in continuing

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.640
architectural identity within
rapidly globalized cities.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.990
Malaysia is experiencing
rapid development

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:45.510
from little villages
into mega cities, steered

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.440
by a series of grand
transformation plans,

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.990
such as the 2020 vision.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.340
One consequence of
rapid development

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.350
is the disappearance of local
architectural values embodied

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.390
in the functional built
form, the living culture,

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.550
and their relationship
with the environment.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.690
The transformation of Malaysian
local architectural identity

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.610
can be seen in
government-led developments

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.880
and is epitomized by the new
federal administrative center,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.630
Putrajaya.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.320
There and elsewhere, the
government's attempts

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.070
to define identity
through architecture

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.080
have been characterized
as top-down and exclusive

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.420
in approach.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.900
Instead of elevating Malaysia's
local architectural traditions,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.200
the top-down approach
to asserting identities

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.670
turns to lead to mimicry or
copying of architectural styles

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.240
from other parts of the world.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.770
Meanwhile, some attempts
for a local identity

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.910
are trapped in
prestige and parody.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.690
The challenge of
preserving local identity

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.300
poses several questions.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.320
How do we ensure the continuity
of architectural identities

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.490
in the face of
rapid development?

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.290
Would a more inclusive approach
to the formation of identity

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.470
be the way forward?

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.240
One project that exemplifies
the struggle of a local identity

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.520
in Malaysia is Kota
Iskandar, the Johor new state

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.440
administrative center, located
outside Johor Bahru, the state

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.030
capital.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.280
Intended as the economy catalyst
project for Iskandar Puteri,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.820
the site for Kota Iskandar was
offered by a land developer UEM

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.440
Land, a joint venture between
this state of Johor and UEM

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.620
Land was created.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.160
A jointly appointed
property developer

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.120
was entrusted to design,
build, and manage the project.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.910
Working within tight budget,
time framework, work on site

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.180
began in 2004 and was
completed in 2008.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.270
UEM Lands' development
strategy for Kota Iskandar

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.450
was dominated by
outside consultants.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.870
The criteria of having
strong project references

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.390
and proven track record
sidelined local consultants.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.880
For the master plan process,
the only local involvement

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.150
was a user requirement survey.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.270
No engagement with
local professionals.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.360
No engagement with
the local community.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.540
No design competition.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.050
And no public forum.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.440
These were not
required by contract,

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.270
and involved more time
and cost to execute.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.720
Although stakeholder
workshops were held,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.600
but did not provide any real
opportunity to offer feedback

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.330
on the design of the buildings.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.250
The urban design and
architectural concept guideline

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.220
made it clear that this project
was intended to showcase

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.930
Johor's cultural heritage.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.300
Johor's two main leaders, the
Chief Minister and the Sultan,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.640
had different
design preferences.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.160
Committed to preserving
local identity

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.060
through cultural heritage,
the Chief Minister

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.150
had traditional Johor
architecture in mind.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.700
The Sultan of Johor,
on the other hand,

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.510
suggested we get to [INAUDIBLE]
administrative building

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.560
as the reference
for Kota Iskandar.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.950
Designed by a British
consultant in 1942,

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.620
the building is an Anglo-Indian
structure with traces

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.440
of various Islamic styles.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.000
But to avoid the stigma
of colonial architecture,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.390
the design team and several
state governments' officials

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.050
made a study tour to
the Alhambra Palace

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.780
in Spain, a 14th century
Moorish-Andalucian heritage

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.530
site.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.910
The resulting Kota
Iskandar master plan, this,

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.020
compromise of two identities.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.870
First, a
Moorish-Andalucian identity

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.260
for the central axis,
which includes the state

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.290
legislative assembly building,
and the state secretariat

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.880
office, and the main plaza.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.340
Second, a Johor
traditional identity

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.590
for the state office complex
is at this site clusters.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.950
The Moorish-Andalucian
identity came up

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.630
off a process that was
top-down and exclusive.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.810
All the projects
were exclusively

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.320
awarded to the architect
member from the master planning

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.420
team who was a non-local.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.140
There was no base selection.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.080
There was no opportunity
for local engagement.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.510
There was no local feedback.

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.030
For the Johor
traditional identity,

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.990
the process was more
inclusive and locally engaging

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.600
because the chief minister
asked for involvement

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.590
from local consultants.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.060
One local consultant submitted
[INAUDIBLE] that were twice

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.770
rejected because his track
record and project references

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.520
were not comparable
to a larger firm's.

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.930
To overcome this obstacle,
he formed a joint venture

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.320
with another passionate
local consultant.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.610
To understand the local
value and aspiration

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.920
in forging identity, the new
team sold out a heritage expert

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.300
from a local university.

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:19.920
In comparison, a
process that led

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.270
to Johor traditional
identity was more inclusive

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.930
and locally engaging.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:29.520
It engaged a local consultant.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.260
It was a joint venture
with a local partner.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:34.620
It saw the local
heritage expert.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.690
It studied local design values.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.570
The outcome of the
top-down down and

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:45.070
exclusive Andalucian identity
is impressively grand,

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.080
but foreign to Johor.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.380
A tower mimics
that of [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.210
but has pseudo-Andalucian
detailing, and copies

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:57.430
of Alhambra arches and columns.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.650
MOHD TAIUDDIN RASDI: Now
here in the modern times,

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:05.370
we simply take things
at its end form.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.430
And so a building,
like the Alhambra,

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.532
supposed to represent great
Islam, so we just transplanted.

00:07:11.532 --> 00:07:13.240
I wouldn't even use
the word replicating,

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.050
it would be like copying
something from the past.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.940
And I think it's too much
of a copy, of an imitation.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.070
GURUPIAH MURSIB: The
uncritical direct copy

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.200
of foreign identity results
in designs unsuitable

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.930
for the local climate.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.670
What do we see?

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:37.580
Huge skylights, too hot for
Johor's equatorial climate,

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:43.110
which require costly
technology to reduce heat gain.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:49.010
Courtyards that are made
of heat radiating surfaces.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.435
Gardens without shade.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:08:01.960
Vast open space makes for an
unbearable sun-baked plaza.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:05.350
CHAU LOON WAI: If we really
consider our tropical climate,

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:11.560
which is generally
warm and humid.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.800
So if we want to make places
comfortable for people,

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.670
then this needs to be really
taken into consideration

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:21.330
in the design in how we
arrange buildings, in how we

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.250
plant trees, provide shading.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.960
GURUPIAH MURSIB: Even though
these foreign forms produced

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.570
unsuitable design
for the climate,

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:32.970
they prevail in Malaysia's
administrative and public

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.960
architecture.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.070
By contrast, the more
inclusive and locally engaging

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.929
process for capturing
local identity

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:46.010
translates Johor
identity in modern forms.

00:08:46.010 --> 00:09:07.300
RA'ALAH MOHAMAD:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.650
GURUPIAH MURSIB:
Reinterpreting local identity,

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:12.530
as opposed to adopting
foreign styles,

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:16.620
pave the path to cultural and
environmental sustainability

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.150
today.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.880
THE design creates functional
contemporary forms,

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.780
accommodates the social
features for office culture,

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:30.730
and responds symbiotically
to the environment.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:36.360
A-frame porches make friendly
and welcoming entryways.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.450
Multi-level verandas cater
space for meeting and greeting

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.620
under generous roof shade.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:48.590
Common lobby features
drama of traditional farms

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:51.690
in space and volume.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.750
Layered roofs allow
greater ventilation

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:58.570
and frame a visual experience.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:03.900
Delightful overhangs provide
ample weather protection.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:08.050
And craft tradition
extended expressive

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:11.400
contemporary detailing.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:15.010
The Chief Minister, the
approving committee,

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:19.640
the master planner, and most
of the professional community

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:21.010
were impressed.

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.320
Inclusive engagement
and design methodology

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.960
were quickly adopted as a
benchmark for the remaining

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.030
design puzzles.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.820
Comparison between the
two identity processes

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:37.530
in Kota Iskandar shows the
importance of local value

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.940
and the role of
local involvement

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.940
in continuing local identity.

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:46.060
Here are some key lessons.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.710
Include local consultants
and local experts

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.660
to allow for deeper
intrinsic attitude

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:57.492
and approach in
incorporating local values.

00:10:57.492 --> 00:11:00.900
Practice, a transparent
and open-bid process,

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:06.680
to promote competitiveness and
to prevent design complacency.

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.320
Consider local
citizen involvement

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.500
for sense of commitment
and attachment.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.620
In order to reflect the culture
and values of the population,

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:21.590
planning process must move
from exclusive to inclusive.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:26.440
This is vital for cultural and
environmental sustainability

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.270
in developing cities today.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:33.130
It is our responsibility to
make sure our cities do not

00:11:33.130 --> 00:11:35.240
end up looking the same.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:38.000
Help preserve our local
heritage and values.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.550
