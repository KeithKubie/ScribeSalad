WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.360
Got It.
I try to balance my life as best I can.

2
00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.940
I don't go through airport scanners as much as I can and have rays.
Uh,

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.910
these little things.
Do you think those are bad for you?
Those are the new ones.

4
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:15.150
Aren't they like a radio wave?
Yeah,
they're,
they're millimeter radio waves.

5
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.030
I don't want to take chances and also don't want to freak people out.

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.910
But the old style ones that were banned in Europe first,

7
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.560
they were potentially damaging.
Um,
is definitely,
uh,

8
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.390
try not to have as many as you can,
but flying is oh,

9
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.260
just as bad as an x ray.
Well that's the problem.
Um,

10
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.550
that was going through a scanner and I said,

11
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.480
I don't want to get through the scanner.

12
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:40.260
And they got quite upset cause it's a bother.
But,
uh,
they said,
you know,

13
00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:44.070
it's just as much,
uh,
damage to your body as the flight.
And so I said,

14
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.950
why do I want to double it anyway,
so I,
I through three scanners,

15
00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:48.803
but I try not to,

16
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.960
but let me tell you why I think it's so bad because scan is going to change.

17
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.450
Uh,
what we call the epigenomes.

18
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.400
Now a lot of people haven't heard of the epigenome.
The genome,

19
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:06.690
everybody knows it's your DNA.
Uh,
the code of life,

20
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.210
the epigenome is what regulates and reads those genes at the right time.
Okay?

21
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.630
And so we've,
we knew about DNA,
we know how to read the genome pretty easily.

22
00:01:15.631 --> 00:01:20.360
We can do that now on a Mars bar sized device in a day.
Uh,

23
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.020
the epigenomes quite different,
different.

24
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.460
The epigenomes is that the structure of how the DNAS looped around?

25
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.040
If you look at the chromosome,
you're not seeing the genome,

26
00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:33.450
you'll probably basically saying epigenomes and what w what I think is causing

27
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:36.900
aging is not that you're losing the DNA structure,

28
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.850
you're not having mutations.
You're actually changing the epigenome,
which is the,

29
00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.980
the reader of the genes to put another way,
a compact disc,
okay.

30
00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.600
Uh,
for the young audience,
uh,
come back,

31
00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:53.250
discs are little things we used to put music on.
Uh,
but anyway,
these are,

32
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.050
these are digital information of course.

33
00:01:55.051 --> 00:01:58.170
And the reason we switched to digital in the first place is that it's very

34
00:01:58.171 --> 00:02:03.030
copyable and it doesn't wear out.
Whereas a cassette tape,
you know,

35
00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:06.330
people our age know that if you try to copy that a thousand times,

36
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:09.220
there's not much left at the end.
So the,

37
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.060
the Compact disc inflammation is the genome.

38
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.500
The epigenome is the reader of the CD.
That little laser that goes around,

39
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.180
and what I think is causing aging is not the loss of the digital information,

40
00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.700
but it's the reader,
the analog part.

41
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.340
And that's like a cassette tape that eventually runs out.
So what we,

42
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.580
what's going on really is that yourselves are losing the ability to read the

43
00:02:32.581 --> 00:02:35.190
right genes the way they did when you were 20,

44
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.710
and that's basically noise,
informational noise that gathers over time.

45
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.960
Um,
and so what we end up with when we're 80 is a compact disc or DVD that

46
00:02:45.961 --> 00:02:49.590
scratched.
So the reader cannot read the right genes,
the right time,

47
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.610
and the cells become dysfunctional.
Now what we're working on is highly Polish,

48
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.050
that CD or that DVD to get that information back again.
And if you can do that,

49
00:02:58.051 --> 00:03:02.910
I think that's really the best way to reset your age.
And I,

50
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.740
I,
we haven't published it yet,
but,
uh,

51
00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.990
we're working on ways to actually reset that genome and actually get back the

52
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:12.100
information that we once had when we were 20.

53
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.400
So what is happening to the epigenome when you're going through those scanners?

54
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.900
Well,
so what we found is the biggest disruptor of the epigenome is,
uh,

55
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.820
a broken chromosome,
DNA break and run about scanners.

56
00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:28.510
That's just an abundance of caution.
But an x ray will damage your DNA,

57
00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:33.010
no question.
Um,
even going out in the sun will do a bit of that.

58
00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.380
And we think that the cells reaction to that break having to unwrap the DNA from

59
00:03:38.381 --> 00:03:40.720
its Chromatin,
we call it,
and uh,

60
00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.670
and then rewrap it is what eventually disrupts the ability to read the right

61
00:03:45.671 --> 00:03:50.350
gene at the right place.
So Dna damage is essentially a little scratch on,

62
00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.930
on the DVD,
and that accumulates over time.

63
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.060
So being out in the sun does the app of being out in the sun also is beneficial.

64
00:03:58.061 --> 00:04:01.260
Your body produces more vitamin D.
Yeah,
well that,

65
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.730
so there's also a theory called antagonistic pleiotropy,

66
00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:06.580
which is what's good for you when you're young comes back to bite you in your

67
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:10.630
old,
ah,
so you might look good and feel good and get vitamin D when you're young.

68
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.540
But the accumulation of these scratches on the Epi genome ends up,
you know,

69
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.880
I'm formerly an,
an Australian originally in Australia now,

70
00:04:18.881 --> 00:04:21.970
American and Australian.
Uh,
I grew up in this straight and son.

71
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.800
And I can tell you that,
you know,
most Australians look older than they should.

72
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.920
No ozone,
uh,

73
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.050
no ozone and lack of sunscreen in the 1970s.

74
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.380
Why do you guys have a whole nose on over Australia?
What's that all about?

75
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.000
What'd you do?
Uh,
no.
It's what,
what did the world to chlorophyll or it ashore?

76
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.320
Uh,
well,
hairspray,
why does it accumulate over Australia is,
or a theory.

77
00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.470
It started in Antarctica and a,
so ozone will,
that'd been convenient.

78
00:04:50.471 --> 00:04:53.320
Nobody's up there.
Leave it up there.
Yeah.
Well if you need a break,

79
00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.570
Leonid below it that way.
Yeah.
Well,
yeah,
the,
the,

80
00:04:57.571 --> 00:05:00.030
the ozone layer is fairly important.
Uh,

81
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.010
if you don't want to get singed by UV light.
Yeah,
yeah.

82
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.520
Well that's one of the first things I noticed when I went to Australia was a,

83
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.140
there's all these sun cancer warnings,
skin cancer warnings everywhere.
Well,

84
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:14.800
a third of Australians get some performance kissed skin cancers.
That's crazy.

85
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:18.610
Yeah.
But what's also gonna happen is it'll disrupt your epigenomes over time and

86
00:05:18.611 --> 00:05:22.240
you'll look old.
Um,
but if you'd have an x Ray,
you're gonna damage your organs.

87
00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:25.780
You can accelerate aging,
I believe in your body.
Um,
and it happened.

88
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.580
You can't avoid double strand breaks.
Crump,

89
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.320
broken chromosomes happens all the time.

90
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.020
There's trillions of cells in your body and it's happening all the time.

91
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.470
So living is a problem.
Okay.
Flying,

92
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.630
flying is even worse about we're working on is how do you get back that original

93
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.460
information into the cell and make a sell?
Not just believe that it's 20 again,

94
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.780
but actually be 20.
So what do you do?
We reprogram them.

95
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:53.650
There are a set of genes that we,
we and others have found,
uh,

96
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.830
three main ones that when you put them into a or even into a mouse,

97
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.330
uh,
they become younger again.
Whoa.

98
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.700
How far do you think you are from implementing this on human beings?
Uh,
well,

99
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:11.420
so theoretically,
uh,
are you doing it to yourself?
You could do it to yourself.

100
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.690
Theoretically I would.
I wouldn't do that because I'm not crazy.

101
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.930
We need to figure out the safety.
I don't want to become a giant tumor.

102
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.070
Why would just use it on bad people?
Uh,
yeah.
Well take,

103
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:25.940
keep knocking on that tournament.
18 year olds and go,
whoa.
Yeah.

104
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:31.220
Well yeah,
that,
that would be for someone else.
Someone else.
Well,

105
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.610
hopefully no one would ever do that.
Why not?
Well would kill him.

106
00:06:34.611 --> 00:06:37.160
His is what we're doing.
I agree with you that we want it.

107
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.980
We want to see what happens in humans.

108
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.780
Just give them like free pizza or something.
They're on death row,

109
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:48.650
right?
If you're there already murderers,
you want to be the first one to me,

110
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.900
come on my lab,
death row and I want to go into death row,

111
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:52.940
but I'm saying if you're going to kill somebody,

112
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.820
like wouldn't be a good idea to like go,
hey,

113
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.340
we'll give you a four hours of TV a day,

114
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:02.360
so we want to shoot you up with some stuff.
It's going gonna make a younger.

115
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.660
If I was on death row,
I'd go do it.
See what's up.
