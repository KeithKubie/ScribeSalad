00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.235
This side of the triangle is 27.

00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:08.880
We can solve this with the proportion
6 over 9 is equivalent to 18 over x.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.160
That means that the ratio of the legs
of this triangle are equivalent to

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.079
the ratio of the legs of this triangle.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.510
We also could have set this up as
6 over 18 is equal to 9 over x,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.850
either one would work.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.490
But back to this proportion,
will just cross multiply and

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.020
we get 6 times x equals 9 times 18.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.829
And we get 6x equals 9
times 18 which is 162

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.815
divide both sides by 6 to isolate x, and

00:00:36.815 --> 00:00:42.930
we get x is equivalent to 162
all over 6 which equals 27.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.786
So x = 27.
