00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.000
There is something electrifying about discovering
an awesome movie.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.090
The plot, characters, and cinematography are
almost enough to judge whether a film is going

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.450
to be a dud or a longtime favorite but the
performances are also integral to the overall

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.820
quality of a movie.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.820
Even if the film is filled with brilliant
acting, one terrible actor can ruin the rest

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.820
of the movie.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.910
Here are 10 Famous Actors Whose Performance
Ruined Their Movies.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.160
Mickey Rooney - Breakfast At Tiffany's
Breakfast at Tiffany’s is a classic film

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.570
starring the elegant and graceful Audrey Hepburn.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.030
It is the film that features many iconic moments
including Hepburn adorned in her black dress,

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.100
pearls, and elbow length gloves while she
eats a croissant in front of the famous jewelry

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.100
store.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.329
While the film certainly took liberties with
Truman Capote’s novella, mostly to appeal

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.570
to mainstream audiences and keep the censors
at bay, it was one particular casting decision

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.489
that was the most maddening.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.110
Mickey Rooney’s portrayal of Mr. Yunioshi
was just so bizarre that it halts the film

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.890
every time he appears.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.950
The casting of a white actor to play a Japanese
character was bad enough but to add prosthetic

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.540
teeth to create Japanese caricature was highly
offensive.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.240
Rooney’s performance is also hammy.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.250
As much as the rest of the film is a delight,
Rooney’s performance is disastrous.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.799
Katie Holmes - Batman Begins
The character of Rachel Dawes was just not

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.050
a success with two actresses giving it a shot
in two different fims.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.170
Maggie Gyllenhaal was slightly shrill and
lacked chemistry with nearly every actor she

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.580
shared the screen with in The Dark Knight,
which was a departure from her usual work.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.740
However, Katie Holmes’s performance was
just bland.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.439
For those viewers who have never seen Holmes
on Dawson’s Creek, you aren’t missing

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.040
much since she plays a version of the same
character in everything she’s in.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.110
While her Rachel Dawes may not ruin the film
as much as others on this list, her apparent

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.110
boredom certainly detracts from the overall
value of the film.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.100
Diane Keaton, Because I said so
The 2007 romantic comedy Because I Said So

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.770
was never going to be a great movie but Diane
Keaton's performance mitigated any possibility

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.450
of it being a watchable flick.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.539
Using her tired combination of zany Annie
Hall mixed with a neurotic female Woody Allen,

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.310
Keaton forces herself into every scene with
attention seeking gusto, making the film nauseating.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.940
Mandy Moore‘s shtick can get exhausting
after a while too but her scenes with the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.150
charming Gabriel Macht are fun to watch.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.040
Moore’s sisters are played by Lauren Graham
and Piper Perabo, who are both a pleasure

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.260
to watch but once Keaton joins in, the movie
falls apart.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.400
Even Stephen Collins who is best known for
his role as the unbearably preachy but well-meaning

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.760
father on 7th Heaven, a show with more bad
acting than good, somehow manages to do a

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.849
better job than an Oscar winner.

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.030
Keaton has proven to be a fine and lovable
actress in previous films, but her work in

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.620
Because I said So is just grating.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.850
Hayden Christensen, Star Wars
There is much speculation over whether Hayden

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.560
Christensen can act.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.569
This mystery is undoubtedly fueled by his
acting in the Star Wars films, Attack of the

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.190
Clones and Revenge of the Sith.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.599
His dry robotic performance supports any theory
that Christensen was not there at all and

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.270
he was just computer generated.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.980
Frankly, if he was simply CGI, the character
may have emoted more successfully.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.930
To be fair, Christensen is a decent actor.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.769
Shattered Glass is proof enough, but there
are a handful of other films that prove he

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.099
knows what he’s doing.

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.600
The worst part of this particularly bad performance
is that it is a vital element of the Star

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.590
Wars saga, he is Darth Vader after all.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.580
Russel Crowe, Les Miserables
Russell Crowe is a fine actor and deserves

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.690
his multiple Academy Award nominations but
even the most impressive thespians can get

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.320
miscast in a film, Les Miserables is that
film.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.540
Since the film is a musical with the actors
singing live, someone probably should have

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.239
let Russell Crowe know that he can’t sing.

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:48.159
Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Eddie Redmayne
have such incredible singing voices and amazing

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.720
acting chops but every time Crowe’s character,
Javert appears on screen, it is time for a

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.099
bathroom break.

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.690
Russell Crowe’s performance and singing
hinder the film so much that it could be the

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.950
reason it lost out for the Best Picture Academy
Award in 2013.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.470
Tommy Lee Jones Batman Forever
In seems nearly impossible to out-chew the

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:11.250
scenery in a film that also features Jim Carrey
but Tommy Lee Jones somehow made it possible

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.670
with Batman Forever.

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.960
His portrayal of Two -Face, is baffling and
loud.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.720
Obviously, once Gotham’s District Attorney,
Harvey Dent becomes the supervillain, Two-Face,

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.909
he may go insane but Jones plays the character
not only bonkers but also incredibly persistent

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:27.300
with roaring his lines.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.259
This is a movie that has Jim Carrey Cackling
as the Riddler, comic explosions, and a blaring

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:37.620
soundtrack by U2 and Seal, and yet it is still
Tommy Lee Jones who is the most deafening

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.440
element of Batman Forever.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.930
Linda Fiorentino, Dogma
Linda Fiorentino’s performance in Dogma

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.460
ruins the movie not because she is a horrid
actress but because of her inability to realistically

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.580
interact with the other actors in the film.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.849
Her character should also be more interesting
than the way she conveys it.

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:56.870
Her monotone monologues feel like she believes
she is in a much more serious film than she

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.199
is and her conversations with each character,
and not just Jay and Silent Bob, would make

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:04.719
you believe that her character thinks everyone
around her is beneath her.

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:09.300
Apparently, Fiorentino was exposing her real-life
distaste for the film as writer and director

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.520
Kevin Smith has stated that the filming of
Dogma was miserable.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.449
If Smith could have done it over again, he
would have cast Janeane Garofalo in the lead

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.650
role rather than relegating her to the minor
role in which she did appear.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.180
Garofalo may have been the perfect fit amongst
the rest of the Kevin Smith regulars and a

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.229
vast improvement to Fiolentino.

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:30.710
&nbsp;
January Jones, X-Men First Class

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.169
After watching January Jones in X-Men: First
Class audiences may be wondering if Jones

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:38.309
attended the Katie Holmes School of Bored
Acting.

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:43.180
Jones is beautiful and her performance in
Mad Men as 1960s housewife Betty Draper is

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.169
flawless but her role as Emma Frost seems
like a retread of Betty which makes no sense

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:49.599
for the comic book character.

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.960
We can look past the unfortunate wardrobe
that looked less Emma Frost and more Fembot

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.149
from Austin Powers but when a character seems
to breathe more life on the pages of a comic

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:01.880
than with a living person acting out the character,
there is little that can be done.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.860
January Jones may be be stunning but her performance
as The White Queen is far from royal.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.740
Keanu Reeves, Dangerous Liaisons
As likable as Keanu Reeves seems as a person,

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.199
the guy has supplied a wealth of bad acting
performances.

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:19.610
His “Whoa” persona may combine his stilted
acting with his general confusion but there

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.629
is still something appealing about him.

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:26.080
While many point to his performances in Bram
Stoker’s Dracula, or even The Matrix, the

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.129
performance that really interrupts an otherwise
fantastic film is Dangerous Liaisons.

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:34.870
His role does not require as much screen time
as Glenn Close, John Malkovich, or Michelle

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.469
Pfeiffer, and that is a good thing.

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:40.499
It is a quiet, yet startled, performance that
attempts seriousness while trying to keep

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:42.879
up with a cast of seasoned thespians.

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:46.939
Reeves’s performance may be what Ashton
Kutcher studies when trying to prove to people

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:50.499
that he is not just some fool who has to bite
his lip to avoid saying “Dude”, when he

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:51.669
plays pretend

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.679
Jaden Smith, After Earth
Nepotism in Hollywood may work in the case

00:06:55.679 --> 00:07:00.729
of Kate Hudson, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Liv Tyler
but when it doesn’t work, it fails miserably.

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:05.099
Jaden Smith’s performance in After Earth
is proof that talent is not always genetic.

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:09.789
As the son of the Fresh Prince himself, Will
Smith, Jaden made his debut as Will’s son

00:07:09.789 --> 00:07:13.969
in The Pursuit of Happyness which required
little acting, The Karate Kid remake was a

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:19.199
slap in the face for those who grew up in
the 80s, and After Earth was just a tragedy.

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:23.219
The science fiction film was a box office
hit which is all thanks to his actual movie

00:07:23.219 --> 00:07:27.819
star father, but Jaden’s presence in the
film ruins any possibility of the film succeeding

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:29.099
on any level.

00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:32.620
Poor Will continues to push for his children
to work in the industry.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.990
It must be true that Parents Just Don’t
Understand.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.029
There you have it.

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:38.610
