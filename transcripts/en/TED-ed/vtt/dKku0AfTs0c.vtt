00:00:07.244 --> 00:00:09.364
Over the course of the 1960s,

00:00:09.366 --> 00:00:13.143
the FBI amassed almost 
two thousand documents

00:00:13.143 --> 00:00:17.246
in an investigation into one 
of America’s most celebrated minds.

00:00:17.246 --> 00:00:21.321
The subject of this inquiry 
was a writer named James Baldwin.

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:22.481
At the time,

00:00:22.487 --> 00:00:25.427
the FBI investigated many 
artists and thinkers,

00:00:25.427 --> 00:00:29.186
but most of their files were a 
fraction the size of Baldwin’s.

00:00:29.186 --> 00:00:31.536
During the years when the FBI hounded him,

00:00:31.536 --> 00:00:35.350
he became one of the best-selling
black authors in the world.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.913
So what made James Baldwin loom 
so large in the imaginations

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:42.105
of both the public and the authorities?

00:00:42.105 --> 00:00:44.022
Born in Harlem in 1924,

00:00:44.022 --> 00:00:46.344
he was the oldest of nine children.

00:00:46.344 --> 00:00:49.609
At age fourteen,
he began to work as a preacher.

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.093
By delivering sermons,
he developed his voice as a writer,

00:00:53.093 --> 00:00:55.462
but also grew conflicted about the Church’s stance

00:00:55.462 --> 00:00:59.010
on racial inequality and homosexuality.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.971
After high school,

00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:04.236
he began writing novels and essays
while taking a series of odd jobs.

00:01:04.236 --> 00:01:06.605
But the issues that had driven him 
away from the Church

00:01:06.605 --> 00:01:09.860
were still inescapable in his daily life.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.674
Constantly confronted with racism 
and homophobia,

00:01:12.674 --> 00:01:16.730
he was angry and disillusioned, 
and yearned for a less restricted life.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.085
So in 1948, 
at the age of 24,

00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:23.035
he moved to Paris on a writing fellowship.

00:01:23.035 --> 00:01:25.571
From France, he published his first novel,

00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:28.814
"Go Tell it on the Mountain," in 1953.

00:01:28.814 --> 00:01:29.794
Set in Harlem,

00:01:29.794 --> 00:01:34.467
the book explores the Church 
as a source of both repression and hope.

00:01:34.467 --> 00:01:37.322
It was popular with both black 
and white readers.

00:01:37.322 --> 00:01:39.235
As he earned acclaim for his fiction,

00:01:39.235 --> 00:01:43.787
Baldwin gathered his thoughts on race, 
class, culture and exile

00:01:43.787 --> 00:01:48.490
in his 1955 extended essay, 
"Notes of a Native Son."

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.580
Meanwhile,

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.422
the Civil Rights movement 
was gaining momentum in America.

00:01:52.422 --> 00:01:56.932
Black Americans were making incremental 
gains at registering to vote and voting,

00:01:56.932 --> 00:02:01.744
but were still denied basic dignities in 
schools, on buses, in the work force,

00:02:01.744 --> 00:02:03.834
and in the armed services.

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:06.751
Though he lived primarily in France 
for the rest of his life,

00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:09.132
Baldwin was deeply invested in 
the movement,

00:02:09.132 --> 00:02:12.149
and keenly aware of his 
country’s unfulfilled promise.

00:02:12.149 --> 00:02:15.075
He had seen family, friends, 
and neighbors

00:02:15.075 --> 00:02:18.714
spiral into addiction, incarceration
and suicide.

00:02:18.714 --> 00:02:21.413
He believed their fates originated 
from the constraints

00:02:21.413 --> 00:02:23.775
of a segregated society.

00:02:23.775 --> 00:02:25.075
In 1963,

00:02:25.075 --> 00:02:27.669
he published "The Fire Next Time,"

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:29.883
an arresting portrait of racial strife

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:32.270
in which he held white America 
accountable,

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.754
but he also went further,

00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:36.721
arguing that racism hurt white people too.

00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:37.821
In his view,

00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:42.048
everyone was inextricably enmeshed 
in the same social fabric.

00:02:42.048 --> 00:02:43.508
He had long believed that:

00:02:43.508 --> 00:02:47.447
“People are trapped in history 
and history is trapped in them.”

00:02:47.447 --> 00:02:49.317
Baldwin’s role in the Civil Rights 
movement

00:02:49.317 --> 00:02:51.347
went beyond observing and reporting.

00:02:51.347 --> 00:02:53.636
He also traveled through the 
American South

00:02:53.636 --> 00:02:56.613
attending rallies giving lectures 
of his own.

00:02:56.613 --> 00:02:59.438
He debated both white politicians 
and black activists,

00:02:59.438 --> 00:03:01.008
including Malcolm X,

00:03:01.008 --> 00:03:04.709
and served as a liaison between black 
activists and intellectuals

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.567
and white establishment leaders 
like Robert Kennedy.

00:03:07.567 --> 00:03:09.280
Because of Baldwin’s unique ability

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.747
to articulate the causes 
of social turbulence

00:03:11.747 --> 00:03:14.627
in a way that white audiences 
were willing to hear,

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:18.736
Kennedy and others tended to see 
him as an ambassador for black Americans

00:03:18.736 --> 00:03:20.906
— a label Baldwin rejected.

00:03:20.906 --> 00:03:22.142
And at the same time,

00:03:22.142 --> 00:03:25.852
his faculty with words led the 
FBI to view him as a threat.

00:03:25.852 --> 00:03:27.608
Even within the Civil Rights movement,

00:03:27.608 --> 00:03:29.978
Baldwin could sometimes feel 
like an outsider

00:03:29.978 --> 00:03:33.044
for his choice to live abroad,
as well as his sexuality,

00:03:33.044 --> 00:03:35.126
which he explored openly 
in his writing

00:03:35.126 --> 00:03:37.897
at a time when homophobia ran rampant.

00:03:37.897 --> 00:03:39.113
Throughout his life,

00:03:39.113 --> 00:03:42.012
Baldwin considered it his role
to bear witness.

00:03:42.012 --> 00:03:43.562
Unlike many of his peers,

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.853
he lived to see some of the
victories of the Civil Rights movement,

00:03:46.853 --> 00:03:51.333
but the continuing racial inequalities in 
the United States weighed heavily on him.

00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:53.981
Though he may have felt trapped 
in his moment in history,

00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:56.775
his words have made generations 
of people feel known,

00:03:56.775 --> 00:03:59.475
while guiding them toward a more 
nuanced understanding

00:03:59.475 --> 00:04:02.524
of society’s most complex issues.
