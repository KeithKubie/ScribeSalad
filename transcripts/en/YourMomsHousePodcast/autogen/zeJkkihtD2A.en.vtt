well let me ask you this medically

01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.000
well let me ask you this medically
 

01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.939
well let me ask you this medically
speaking I mean is that really possible

01:37:04.939 --> 01:37:04.949

what that guys doing or is that fake
 

01:37:06.570 --> 01:37:09.470
what that guys doing or is that fake
it's possible is that the bacteria can

01:37:09.470 --> 01:37:09.480
it's possible is that the bacteria can
 

01:37:09.480 --> 01:37:10.939
it's possible is that the bacteria can
produce a lot of gas right they solute

01:37:10.939 --> 01:37:10.949
produce a lot of gas right they solute
 

01:37:10.949 --> 01:37:14.150
produce a lot of gas right they solute
that I tried to do are you writing this

01:37:14.150 --> 01:37:14.160
that I tried to do are you writing this
 

01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:14.689
that I tried to do are you writing this
down

01:37:14.689 --> 01:37:14.699
down
 

01:37:14.699 --> 01:37:17.270

and so the methane that's produced by

01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280
and so the methane that's produced by
 

01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:19.100
and so the methane that's produced by
the bacteria can be high volume and if

01:37:19.100 --> 01:37:19.110
the bacteria can be high volume and if
 

01:37:19.110 --> 01:37:20.479
the bacteria can be high volume and if
he holds it in for periods of time and

01:37:20.479 --> 01:37:20.489
he holds it in for periods of time and
 

01:37:20.489 --> 01:37:22.400
he holds it in for periods of time and
then films it when it's time to go yeah

01:37:22.400 --> 01:37:22.410
then films it when it's time to go yeah
 

01:37:22.410 --> 01:37:24.680
then films it when it's time to go yeah
