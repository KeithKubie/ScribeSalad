00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:02.985
We humans like to get
our heads around all

00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:06.400
of the complexity around
us by classifying things.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.520
And you could imagine
there's no more obvious thing

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.510
to classify than all of the
living things around us,

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.441
than all of the life
that surrounds us.

00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:16.149
So what I want to
start talking about is,

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:19.060
how do we classify all
of the life around us?

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.620
And this is more often
generally referred to taxonomy.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.149
But the most basic
question you have

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:25.690
when you look at
all the life around,

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.930
you start to see similarities
between some of these living

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:29.710
things.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.560
You see, obviously this
thing right over here

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.670
is more similar to the
things that look like it,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.170
than it does to the grass
behind it, or to that tree.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.190
And so we start saying, well
maybe I should group this thing

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.580
right over here into a group
with other things like it.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.740
And that very most
building block

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.240
of how we classify all of
the living things around us,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.320
is putting them into
buckets called species.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.110
So for example, this is
one particular animal,

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.840
but we see other animals
that seem to look like it,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.910
and so we say they're all
part of the species of lions.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.347
And this animal,
it's one animal,

00:01:11.347 --> 00:01:13.180
and there's other animals
that have stripes,

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.470
but some might be fatter,
or taller, or skinnier,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.324
or whatever else,
darker, or lighter,

00:01:17.324 --> 00:01:18.740
but we say they're
similar enough,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.352
that we call them all tigers.

00:01:22.352 --> 00:01:24.060
We call all the animals,
even though they

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.665
might be a little bit bigger,
or skinnier, or fatter,

00:01:26.665 --> 00:01:30.200
or lighter, or darker, we
call all of them-- they look

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.860
similar to this thing
right over here--

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.727
we would call this a donkey.

00:01:36.727 --> 00:01:38.310
We would call the
things that we think

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.920
are like this animal
right here, a horse.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.340
Now, that might seem like a
pretty straightforward way

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.090
to think about it.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.340
Oh, everything that looks kind
of like this character right

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.798
here is a lion,
anything that looks

00:01:49.798 --> 00:01:52.100
kind of like this character
right here is a tiger.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.810
But that, by itself, is not
a good enough definition

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:56.560
for a species.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.579
Things that look like
each other or things that

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.370
act like each other,
because what we'll see

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.330
is that there's some
things that could

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.330
be very different, at least
in and how they look or act,

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.940
but are actually
closely related.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.639
And we'll talk about what it
means to be closely related.

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:12.180
And then we can see things that
look very similar, that they

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.010
have similar structures or
they have similar behavior,

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.130
like for example bats and
birds, but they are actually

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.660
all very, very
distantly related.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.220
So we need a more exact
definition for species

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.410
than just things that
look like each other,

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.500
or just things that
act like each other.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.280
And so the most typical
definition for species

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.300
are animals that can interbreed.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.110
And when we say
interbreed, literally they

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.030
can produce offspring
with each other,

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.960
and the offspring are fertile.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.400
Which means that the offspring
can then further have babies,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.550
that they're not
sterile, that they're

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.820
capable of breeding
with other animals

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.570
and producing more offspring.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.690
And to show an example of this,
this right here is a male lion.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.190
You find a male lion
and a female lioness

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.720
and most of the time they will
be able to have offspring,

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.180
and those offspring
can go and mate

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.770
with other lions or lionesses,
depending on their sex,

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.620
and then they can
have viable offspring.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.080
So it seems to work out
pretty well for lions.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.350
Same thing is true of tigers.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.590
Now, it does turn
out that if you

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:35.720
get a male lion and a female
tigress they can breed.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.719
They can breed and they
can produce offspring.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:40.510
And their offspring--
which was made famous

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.010
by Napoleon Dynamite, he
was kind of fascinated by,

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.800
these are kind of
fascinating animals.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.210
Their offspring
is called a liger.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.140
You get a male lion
breeding with a female tiger

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.510
you produce a liger,
which is a hybrid,

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.847
it's a cross between
a lion and a tiger.

00:03:55.847 --> 00:03:57.180
And they're fascinating animals.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.810
They're actually larger
than either lions or tigers.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.530
They are the largest
cats that we know of.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.830
But these ligers cannot be
referred as a separate species.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.140
Or you can't say
that lions and tigers

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.020
are the same species,
because even though they

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:16.550
are able to interbreed, their
offspring, for the most part,

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.410
is not fertile, is not
able to produce offspring.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.360
There have been one off
stories about ligers

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.451
being mated with either
a lion or a tiger,

00:04:25.451 --> 00:04:26.700
but those are one off stories.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.280
In general, ligers
can't interbreed.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.400
And in general, this
combination isn't

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.140
going to produce offspring
that can keep interbreeding

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.210
or that are fertile.

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.770
So that's why we say
that lions and tigers are

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.309
different species.

00:04:40.309 --> 00:04:42.850
And that liger, we wouldn't even
call it as a species at all.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.130
We would actually call it a
hybrid between two species.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.005
Now the same thing is
true-- and actually you

00:04:48.005 --> 00:04:49.505
might be asking
yourself, well, this

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:51.729
was a male lion and
a female tigress,

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.270
what if we went the
other way around?

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.332
What if we had a female
lioness and a male tiger?

00:04:57.332 --> 00:04:59.540
In that case, you would
produce something else called

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.500
a tiglon or a tiglon,
I actually don't

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.880
know how to pronounce that.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.400
And that is a
different hybrid that

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.370
has slightly different
properties than a liger.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.930
I encourage you to look
up what a tiglon is.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:16.990
Similarly, you give
me a male donkey.

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.760
And donkeys are clearly
a species by themselves,

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.680
because if you give me a male
donkey and a female donkey they

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.630
can reproduce, produce
another donkey,

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.140
and then that donkey can
mate with other donkeys

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.550
to produce more
and more donkeys.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.160
So not only can a donkey
interbreed with another donkey,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.750
but that product,
that child donkey,

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.300
can keep interbreeding
with other donkeys.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.910
Similarly, horses, they
can interbreed and produce

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.090
fertile offspring.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.890
But if you give me a male
donkey and a female horse

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.940
they can mate and they
can produce a mule.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.350
But once again, like
the ligers, mules

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.760
are not, at least
as far as I know,

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.020
mules they're not fertile.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.860
Mules cannot produce
further offspring.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.000
They cannot interbreed
with each other.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.440
And because, even though
donkeys and horses can

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.900
breed and produce mules, their
offspring aren't fertile.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.110
We don't consider
donkeys and horses

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.930
part of the same species.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.310
And we would consider mules,
like a liger or a tiglon,

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.910
we would consider them a hybrid.

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.402
So these are all hybrids,
or we would call cross.

00:06:25.402 --> 00:06:26.860
In general, the
word hybrid is used

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.160
when you have two things,
two different types that

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.990
are somehow coming together,
somehow having a combination.

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.920
And once again, like the
case with the tiglon,

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.336
you might say,
well, what if I had

00:06:36.336 --> 00:06:40.415
a female donkey
and a male horse?

00:06:40.415 --> 00:06:42.290
And then you would
actually produce something

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:48.539
called a hinny, which
isn't as common as a mule.

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:50.080
And people like to
use mules, they're

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.520
actually very good work
animals because they

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.080
have some of the good properties
of both donkeys and horses.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.790
Hinnies are less common, but
once again, it is possible.

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.840
And they have different
properties than mules.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.122
And I do want to
emphasize this idea.

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:04.830
Because when we started
off we just tried

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.871
to think about, well, how
can we classify things?

00:07:06.871 --> 00:07:09.420
And we said, hey, maybe things
that look and act similar,

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.056
we can call a species.

00:07:12.056 --> 00:07:13.930
And maybe things that
look and act different,

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.340
we shouldn't call them species.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.070
But I want to show you a
very typical case, one that's

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.760
really all around us all the
time, where this definition--

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.190
animals that can interbreed
and the offspring are fertile--

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.410
really does seem to become much,
much more important than just

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.840
some notion of animals
that look alike

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.120
or animals that act the same.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.220
And the best example
of that is with dogs.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.820
As I said, this is a very
typical species here,

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.800
because dogs-- and I just
took a sample of some

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.710
of the different types
of breeds of dogs--

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.080
they can look very,
very different.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.760
It's obvious, look at the
difference between these dogs.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.220
For example, this
little chihuahua

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:53.770
here and this dog
right over here.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.040
Obviously, they're
size-wise, their look,

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.750
and even how they act are much,
much more different than maybe

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.040
how this donkey would act
relative to this horse,

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.820
or how this lion would act
relative to this tigress.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.739
And they obviously
look very different,

00:08:07.739 --> 00:08:09.280
they have completely
different sizes,

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.899
but these two things
actually can interbreed--

00:08:12.899 --> 00:08:14.440
although for these
two in particular,

00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.780
it seems like the mechanics
would get kind of difficult--

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:18.850
but assuming they get over
the mechanical hurdles

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.510
they could interbreed and
produce fertile offspring.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.950
Same for these two characters,
same for these two characters

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:26.735
over here.

00:08:26.735 --> 00:08:29.110
And because of that, even
though all the different breeds

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.790
of dogs-- and most
of this is really

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:33.400
due to humans' doings
of trying to breed

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.950
for a specific traits-- even
though they look so different,

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.440
and even though they act so
different, because they can

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.190
interbreed, and they could
produce fertile offspring,

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:44.740
we consider all of
