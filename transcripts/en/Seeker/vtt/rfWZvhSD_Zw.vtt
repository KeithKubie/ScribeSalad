00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:06.149
Shh, I’m drafting an email about the gif
vs jif debate.

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:08.149
Sent,

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:09.580
Our brains are individuals.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.730
Little gelatinous masses...

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.530
But Silicon Valley superstars want to create
something from science fiction that would

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.740
change all that -- a new tech called neural
lace.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.320
“Neural lace” was coined by Iain Banks
in a long running set of science fiction novels.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.230
In the books, the tech helps brains interact
with AI, and with each other.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.929
Back in the real world, tech companies want
to give your brain this same upgrade!

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:34.360
No, thank you, I say.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.860
Good day, sir.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.910
Neural lace might sound shiney, but it’s
just another way of saying, Brain Computer

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.430
Interface -- something scientists have experimented
with for decades.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.830
This totally took off in the 90s, and by the
late 2000s there were more than 100 new, peer-reviewed

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.180
papers a year just looking at how to hook
up man to machine…

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.700
We’ve hooked up rats to these things with
mixed results.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.590
We’ve made it so paralyzed people could
move a cursor or feel sensations.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.270
We’ve even made the whole thing wireless!

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.410
Right now, tbh, BCI’s are not awesome.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.360
They suck up information about brain activity…
like brainwaves with EEGs, or blood flow with

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.500
fMRIs.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.800
They can measure activity with electrodes,
but to date no BCI can directly interconnect

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.120
and read neurons in the brain.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.720
We just get a general idea of what’s going
on.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.100
And that’s what neural lace is promising.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.450
A direct, hard connection.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.480
Right now, it’s sort of like we’re watching
the brain through binoculars, rather than

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.920
going over and just having a chat.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.520
Which makes humanity sound like real creepers.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.530
Neural lace’s promise, is that the lace
would be injected into the brain, embed itself,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.640
and then live in there, intertwined with your
brain cells -- translating your thoughts into

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.420
computers, uploading and downloading information
from networks and so on.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.920
This could improve memory, and allow us to
keep up with AI -- we could even communicate

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.920
with each other!

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.890
I know, it sounds amazing.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.450
But it doesn’t exist, yet.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.860
Not in the way you’re thinking.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.479
Yes, Elon Musk, the Lex Luthor slash Tony
Stark of our day has teased it.

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.590
But we’re not there yet.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.170
Here’s where we are: A prototype of brain-injectible
technology was published in Nature Nanotechnology

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.390
in 2015.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.740
After injection, this nanoscopic plastic-and-metal
mesh embedded itself in mouse brains.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:14.980
That’s it.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.010
We’ve invented a plug.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.620
A socket.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.900
A place where we can start to connect a brain
to something else.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.980
This seems akin to learning how wires work,
and saying we’ve invented the internet,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.160
computer and the smartphone.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.010
The paper made a splash, because it’s the
first successful embedding.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.690
Right now, BCI’s require invasive brain
surgery, massive computers, or are just too

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.280
crude to be useful.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.490
This is just an injection.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.130
Which is a huge win!

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.130
But…

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.790
Being able to add an interface right into
the brain is a step down the path to The Singularity

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.530
-- when man and machine become one… but
it’s just ah- step.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.790
Think about it… what’s the lace going
to run on?

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.700
glucose from the brain?

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.950
It would need to be more efficient than the
brain itself.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.090
It would need to communicate out of the head
reliably, and would need to not cause the

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.660
immune system to reject it, or adapt if cells
moved or died nearby.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.460
Right now, it’s being seen as a way to deliver
drugs or therapy for Parkinson’s, diagnose

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.520
head injuries or treat cancers, at the moment
it’s still fairly science fictional.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.959
But the promise of being completely interconnected
is pretty incredible!

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.920
So count on hearing about it, a lot, in the
coming years.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.209
I mean, we’re basically cyborgs already…
using phones and computers to augment our

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.310
brains, so why not just plug them right in?

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.680
Look, we’re doing all this to better integrate
man and machine so we can compete with AI,

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.680
right?

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.310
Well, we might be out of luck because robots
can sense emotions via radio waves.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.810
We’re screwed.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.310
Check out this video, here for more info.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.599
And let us know down in the comments if you
are worried about AI, cause some of you probably

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.379
are, and please subscribe for more Seeker.
