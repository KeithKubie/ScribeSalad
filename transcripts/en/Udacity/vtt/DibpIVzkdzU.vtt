00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.680
I see. well, it, it sounds still like there's

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.420
a lot, There's a lot of stuff that goes

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.160
on from the time that you guys get that

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.100
raw data. And you sort of do your quality control,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.079
your QC check before you know, I see it

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:20.020
on my 23andMe profile page. I mean is, is,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.730
is all of that just sort of computational biology

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.960
at that point? who, who is looking at that data?

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.840
Whose organizing it? What's sort of going on there?

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.790
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it really becomes a computational

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.090
biology problem once we get the data

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.582
from the lab and that's really where

00:00:34.582 --> 00:00:39.380
23andMe concentrates. most of our, staff here are

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.660
computational biologists, or software engineers so that's

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.410
really where we're best. so, the next

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.990
major component there is called Calling. That's

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.970
turning the data that we get from the

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.390
lab into the AAs, AGs, or GGs that you can download in your raw data.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.630
Or produce the reports you see on our website. and that's kind

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.230
of an involved process but it in essence relies on looking at these

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.010
XY plots. And making sure that everything was where we expect it to be.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.260
&gt;&gt; and so the final results that, that we get back seem to look so,

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.810
so curated and so, so official. wha, I mean how much of the computational

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.540
sort of side of this is sort of deriving, you know, oh what did this

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.590
letter mean. I mean how do you, I mean are you guys viewing all

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.300
the literature and, and selecting things and

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.260
how, how are those decisions made in general?

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.620
&gt;&gt; So we actually have a pretty big

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.290
content team at 23andMe. They're the ones who scour

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.880
the literature, look at what's going on in the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.400
current science of genetics. And find out this mutation

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.800
or this variant causes this disease and it's a

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.610
new discovery. Then they would write up what they think

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.400
about that and try to put it in a language that makes sense to our users. And if

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.340
it meets our scientific criteria, it goes out to

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.740
the website. It is all automated it can take time

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.170
just to process the data through through to the

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.290
website. But the actual process of taking your data, calling

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.620
all of the variants and all that is quite

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.340
quick. You can think of the website as being in

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.250
two parts, there's the part where we, just look

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.200
at the calls that you have for a disease. And,

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.470
the report just links that call to the results.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.140
Say for example, we could say, you are a carrier

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.360
of, of cystic fibrosis because you have this

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.860
variant. That's, that's a scientific challenge, to figure out.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.383
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:38.383 --> 00:02:41.140
&gt;&gt; What's going on in the literature, but it's not an algorithmic

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.860
challenge. The other part of the website includes things like our Ancestry

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.580
Composition feature. And our Relative Finder

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.010
feature, those are difficult algorithmic problems.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.400
You want to take the whole you know, genotype sample. All million variance

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.040
to try and figure out, based on

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.720
that, what is this person's ancestral composition.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.380
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.880
&gt;&gt; So you can imagine that that's actually a more complex task and requires a

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.210
lot of code taking it from, you know, a, b, c, through to the end.
