00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.541
- [Voiceover] Let's see
if we can figure out what

00:00:01.541 --> 00:00:05.788
x plus seven, let me write
that a little bit neater,

00:00:05.788 --> 00:00:09.485
x plus seven squared is.

00:00:09.485 --> 00:00:10.643
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:13.223
and work through it on your own.

00:00:13.223 --> 00:00:15.295
Alright, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:15.295 --> 00:00:16.494
So we just have to remember,

00:00:16.494 --> 00:00:19.664
we're squaring the entire binomial.

00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:22.813
So this thing is going
to be the same thing as:

00:00:22.813 --> 00:00:26.368
x plus seven times x plus seven.

00:00:26.368 --> 00:00:27.040
I'm gonna write the second

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.440
x plus seven in a different color,

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.253
which is going to be helpful when

00:00:29.253 --> 00:00:31.832
we actually multiply things out.

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:32.910
When we see it like this,

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.312
then we can multiply these out the way

00:00:34.312 --> 00:00:36.559
we would multiply any binomials.

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.287
And I'll first do it
the, I guess you can say,

00:00:38.287 --> 00:00:40.258
the slower way, but
the more intuitive way,

00:00:40.258 --> 00:00:43.143
applying the distributive property twice.

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:44.709
And then we'll think
about maybe some shortcuts

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:46.677
or some patterns we might
be able to recognize,

00:00:46.677 --> 00:00:49.420
especially when we are squaring binomials.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.479
So let's start with just applying

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.103
the distributive property twice.

00:00:52.103 --> 00:00:56.755
So let's distribute
this yellow x plus seven

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:59.741
over this magenta x plus seven.

00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:03.236
So we can multiply it by
the x, this magenta x,

00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:07.395
so it's going to be x, let
me do it in that same color.

00:01:07.395 --> 00:01:10.453
So it's going to be magenta x

00:01:10.453 --> 00:01:14.375
times x plus seven

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:17.446
plus magenta seven

00:01:17.446 --> 00:01:21.082
times yellow x plus seven.

00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:23.357
X plus seven, and now we can apply the

00:01:23.357 --> 00:01:25.389
distributive property again.

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:27.197
We can take this magenta x

00:01:27.197 --> 00:01:29.393
and distribute it over the x plus seven.

00:01:29.393 --> 00:01:33.050
So x times x is x-squared.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.072
X times seven is seven x.

00:01:37.072 --> 00:01:39.388
And then we can do it again over here.

00:01:39.388 --> 00:01:42.537
This seven, let me do
it in a different color,

00:01:42.537 --> 00:01:46.134
so this seven times that x is going to be

00:01:46.134 --> 00:01:48.713
plus another seven x

00:01:48.713 --> 00:01:51.476
and then the seven times the seven

00:01:51.476 --> 00:01:53.995
is going to be 49.

00:01:53.995 --> 00:01:56.578
And we're in the home stretch.
We can then simplify it.

00:01:56.578 --> 00:01:59.115
This is going to be x-squared

00:01:59.115 --> 00:02:01.716
and then these two middle
terms we can add together.

00:02:01.716 --> 00:02:06.533
Seven x, let me do this in orange,

00:02:06.533 --> 00:02:10.535
seven x plus seven x is going to be 14 x

00:02:10.535 --> 00:02:15.042
plus 14 x plus 49.

00:02:15.042 --> 00:02:20.042
Plus 49.

00:02:21.862 --> 00:02:22.686
And we're done.

00:02:22.686 --> 00:02:25.754
Now the key question is do
we see some patterns here?

00:02:25.754 --> 00:02:27.806
Do we see some patterns
that we can generalize

00:02:27.806 --> 00:02:29.899
and that might help us square binomials

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.317
a little bit faster in the future?

00:02:32.317 --> 00:02:34.775
Well, when we first looked at
just multiplying binomials,

00:02:34.775 --> 00:02:37.142
we saw a pattern like

00:02:37.142 --> 00:02:41.652
x plus a times x plus b

00:02:41.652 --> 00:02:45.248
is going to be equal to x-squared,

00:02:45.248 --> 00:02:46.120
let me write it this way,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.474
is going to be equal to x-squared plus

00:02:49.474 --> 00:02:52.008
a plus b

00:02:52.008 --> 00:02:56.233
x plus b-squared.

00:02:56.233 --> 00:02:58.813
And so, if both a and
b are the same thing,

00:02:58.813 --> 00:03:01.613
we can say that x plus a

00:03:01.613 --> 00:03:04.271
times x plus a

00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:07.361
is going to be equal to x-squared,

00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:09.757
and this is the case when we have a

00:03:09.757 --> 00:03:13.063
coefficient of one on both
of these x's, x-squared's.

00:03:13.063 --> 00:03:15.194
Now in this case, a and b are both a.

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:17.524
So it's going to be a plus a times x,

00:03:17.524 --> 00:03:20.916
or we can just say plus two a x.

00:03:20.916 --> 00:03:22.604
Let me be clear what I just did.

00:03:22.604 --> 00:03:23.714
Instead of writing a plus b,

00:03:23.714 --> 00:03:27.452
I can just view this as a plus a times x,

00:03:27.452 --> 00:03:30.622
and then plus a-squared,

00:03:30.622 --> 00:03:31.881
or that's the same thing as

00:03:31.881 --> 00:03:36.032
x-squared plus two a x

00:03:36.032 --> 00:03:39.262
plus a-squared.

00:03:39.262 --> 00:03:42.473
This is a general way of expressing

00:03:42.473 --> 00:03:44.509
a squared binomial like this.

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:46.235
A squared binomial where the coefficients

00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:47.557
on both x's are one.

00:03:47.557 --> 00:03:49.751
We can see that's exactly
what we saw over here.

00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:53.733
In this, in the example
we did, seven is our a.

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:57.675
So we got x-squared right
over there let me circle it.

00:03:57.675 --> 00:03:59.544
So we have this blue x-squared

00:03:59.544 --> 00:04:01.352
that corresponds to that over there.

00:04:01.352 --> 00:04:03.770
And then seven is our a,

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.732
so two a x , two times seven is 14 x.

00:04:07.732 --> 00:04:11.124
Notice we have the 14 x right over there.

00:04:11.124 --> 00:04:15.472
So this 14 x corresponds to two a x,

00:04:15.472 --> 00:04:17.706
and then finally if a is seven,

00:04:17.706 --> 00:04:20.491
a-squared is 49.

00:04:20.491 --> 00:04:23.010
A-squared is 49.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.550
So in general if you are
squaring a binomial, you could,

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.049
a fast way of doing it is
to do this pattern here,

00:04:28.049 --> 00:04:29.653
and we can do another example real fast,

00:04:29.653 --> 00:04:32.153
just to make sure that
we've understood things.

00:04:32.153 --> 00:04:34.226
If I were to tell you what is x minus,

00:04:34.226 --> 00:04:36.012
I'll throw a negative in here,

00:04:36.012 --> 00:04:37.577
x minus three squared,

00:04:37.577 --> 00:04:38.492
I encourage you to pause the video

00:04:38.492 --> 00:04:39.590
and think about it.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.537
Think about expressing
this using this pattern.

00:04:43.855 --> 00:04:46.435
Well this is going to
be, in this case our a,

00:04:46.435 --> 00:04:47.268
we have to be careful,

00:04:47.268 --> 00:04:49.706
our a is going to be negative three,

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.982
so that is our a right over there.

00:04:51.982 --> 00:04:56.771
So this is going to be equal to x-squared.

00:04:56.771 --> 00:04:59.787
Now two a x, let me do it
in the same colors actually,

00:04:59.787 --> 00:05:00.864
just for fun.

00:05:00.864 --> 00:05:02.834
So it's going to be x-squared.

00:05:02.834 --> 00:05:05.516
Now what is two times a times x?

00:05:05.516 --> 00:05:09.153
A is negative three, so two
times a is negative six.

00:05:09.153 --> 00:05:11.064
So it's going to be negative six x.

00:05:11.064 --> 00:05:15.208
So, minus six x, that's two
times a is the coefficient.

00:05:15.208 --> 00:05:16.691
And then we have our x there.

00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:18.337
And then plus a-squared.

00:05:18.337 --> 00:05:19.962
Well if a is negative three,

00:05:19.962 --> 00:05:22.034
what is negative three
times negative three?

00:05:22.034 --> 00:05:24.613
It's going to be positive nine.

00:05:24.613 --> 00:05:27.033
And just like that, when
we looked at this pattern,

00:05:27.033 --> 00:05:28.373
we were able to very quickly figure out

00:05:28.373 --> 00:05:31.806
what this binomial squared actually is.

00:05:31.806 --> 00:05:33.147
And I encourage you, you can do it again,

00:05:33.147 --> 00:05:35.078
with applying the
distributive property twice

00:05:35.078 --> 00:05:37.859
to verify that this is
indeed the same thing as

00:05:37.859 --> 00:05:41.158
x minus three squared.
