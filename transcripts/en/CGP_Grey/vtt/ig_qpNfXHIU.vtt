00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
Rulers are so often related: power passes from member to member, forming a dynasty.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.720
Not just with royalty or dictators, but also with representatives in a democracy.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:19.960
Families pass power, or vie with other families for a turn at the top, much more than chance would have.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:29.080
Dynasties seem so natural, you may have never deeply considered them, but you must if you wish to grasp and hold power as long as possible.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.720
Even if you follow The Rules for Rulers we have discussed:

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.880
… swaying the keys to power, securing the treasure, and controlling the court: no man rules forever.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.980
Dictators with resources abundant and power unchallenged still die.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.080
And representatives must contend with death both literal and political.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.480
But no matter what kind of ruler you are, your keys to power value their treasure.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:03.460
They keep you in your position, not for love of you in particular, but for the rewards you provide, in general.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.360
But dead rulers can't distribute treasure.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.440
Thus as your grave approaches. your keys supporters get nervous.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.860
Your impending death forces your keys to plan for your replacement, …

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.500
…not just to maintain their treasure, but also because a dead ruler surprise without plans in place will lead…

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.140
…to a scramble for power at best, and a blood bath at worst, …

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.740
… leaving many keys on the inside now, on the outside after.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.460
This is why, if you happen to be sick, keep it secret:

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.120
If your keys even think you might die on them, they must start planning for the next ruler to avoid this.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.260
Which is what makes even a rumor about the ruler's health… concerning.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:57.140
Whispers about your health are a destabilizing poison in the minds of your key supporters, nearly impossible to remove.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.260
To the keys, your replacement is inevitable anyway, so why not start planning sooner.  Just in case.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.640
Thus after a rumor, the keys might seem to stay on your side in their actions, …

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.360
…but you’re already dead in their minds.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.280
You've lost control and will lose your throne, sooner than you like.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.360
But while you can't defend against the reaper or extract poison from the minds of your key supporters:

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.040
There is a way to defend your power in this world from rumors of your departure to the next.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.340
Family.  Family is the answer.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.900
Dictatorships and democracies have so much family rule, because the key supporters want it.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.860
As your term limit or deathbed approach, your family is there ready to keep turning the machinery of power:

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.500
…keep raising the treasure, keep the keys calm and plot-free.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.020
Sure, warmhearted rulers may want to give their family advantages, …

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.060
…and being the ruler comes with many, …

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.520
…but the key supporters also want the ruler's family in positions of power because…

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.340
… the family that plots together, rules together.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.660
Generational power: transcending death and term limits.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.520
Thus your keys get to worry less about transitions of power, and you get to worry less about their plans for your replacement.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.500
While key supporters won't ever simply trust you and your family,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.140
…the keys can look at the motivating interests of you all:

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.920
Calculating that sticking with your family during a transition gives them better odds of staying on the inside …

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.280
…because they know you and your relatives.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:40.080
Also, calculate sticking with the keys during a transition gives you better odds of staying on the thrown.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.540
It's a virtuous cycle.  Formed by calculations that are like trust, but better.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.860
The ruler gets to rule longer, the keys get to worry less, …

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.120
…and everything is smooth because when the king is dead, long live the king.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.600
So put family in high-ranking military, business, or political positions.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.560
Never mind their 'qualifications' because being family is the qualification.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.320
They must work with your key supporters, so they know where the money comes from and how it is distributed.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.140
Family's relationships with the keys keep everyone calm not just during the transition,…

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.900
… but more importantly for you and your political longevity: preceding it.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:26.160
So even if you have no interest in a spouse and have no love for babies, nonetheless: acquire them.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.560
Of course, the risk you run with family is they too will overthrow you.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:36.020
Many a cunning prince has stabbed his king in the back once confident the keys won't mind.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:44.800
But nothing is certain, you can only play the odds, and a ruler without family is more vulnerable to rivals and rumors.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:52.180
Remember, your keys care about the security of their treasure in general, not you in particular.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.280
And for them, a family of rulers is a safer investment.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:03.340
Thus, possible regicide is the price you pay for buying the longer and securer reign a family brings.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.280
Which is why: families are so popular among rulers and their key supporters.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.720
Family is a tool for maintaining power, just like any other.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:38.040
