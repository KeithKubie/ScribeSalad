00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.570
You are listening to radiolab radio from W.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.780
N y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R.

3
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.270
So you're gonna identify the Washington place cause I can't remember what, yeah,

4
00:00:13.271 --> 00:00:15.810
yeah. Okay. Three, two, one. Ready?

5
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.210
I am ready but we should tell the audience that we're not gonna.

6
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.480
We're gonna start this not in our usual studios spot. Not here.

7
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:23.460
Here where we're sitting now here.

8
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.263
<v 1>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.800
<v 0>Just to explain, this is the Shakespeare theater in DC.</v>

10
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.160
Recently Robert and I were there in front of about 800 folks just trying out

11
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:33.300
some material for the show.

12
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.760
We're getting with this story which comes from Pleateau actually by way of

13
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.620
Aristophanes. It's a 2,400 year old story breaking news. In other words,

14
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.120
and it goes like this.

15
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.740
<v 2>Once upon a time he says people were not born separate from each other.</v>

16
00:00:51.741 --> 00:00:55.970
They were born intertwined, kind of coupled with each other.

17
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.400
So they were boys attached to boys and they were girls attached to girls and of

18
00:01:01.401 --> 00:01:05.390
course boys and girls together in a wonderfully intimate ball.

19
00:01:05.391 --> 00:01:09.590
And back then we had eat limbs. They were four on top, four on the bottom.

20
00:01:09.591 --> 00:01:13.130
And you didn't have to walk if he didn't want to. You could roll and roll.

21
00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:18.050
We did. We rolled backwards and we rolled forwards achieving fantastic speeds.

22
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.450
That gave us a kind of courage.

23
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.630
And then the courage swelled to pride and the pride became arrogant.

24
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.380
And then we decided that we were greater than the gods and we tried to roll up

25
00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:34.130
to heaven and take over heaven and the gods alarms struck back.

26
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.640
And Zeus in his fury hurled down lightning bolts and struck everyone into,

27
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.000
into perfect halves. So all of a sudden,

28
00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:46.970
couples who'd been warm and tight and wedged together,

29
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.720
we're now detached and alone and lost and desperate and losing the will to live.

30
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.260
And the gods seen what they'd done,

31
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.560
worried that humans might not survive or even multiply again.

32
00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:03.740
And of course they needed humans to give sacrifices and pay attention to them.

33
00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:06.200
So the gods decided on a few repairs,

34
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.900
instead of heads facing backwards or out,

35
00:02:08.901 --> 00:02:11.630
they would rotate our heads back to forward.

36
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.410
They pulled our skin taut and nodded it right here at the belly button.

37
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.430
Genitalia too, were moved to the front. So if we wanted to, you know, we could,

38
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.510
and most important, they left us with a memory.

39
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.460
It was a longing for that original other half of ourselves,

40
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.640
the boy or the girl who used to make us whole.

41
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.440
And that longing is still so deep in all of us. Men for men, women for women,

42
00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:37.760
men for women for each other,

43
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.160
that it has been a lot of humans ever since to travel the world looking for our

44
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.520
other half. And when says Aristophanes when one of us meets another,

45
00:02:46.521 --> 00:02:49.100
we recognize each other right away. We just know this.

46
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.660
We're lost in an amazement of love and friendship and intimacy.

47
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.950
We won't get out of each other's sight even for a moment. These are people,

48
00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:00.310
he says who their whole lives

49
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.690
<v 3>together. And yet if you ask them,</v>

50
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.410
they could not explain what they desire of each other.

51
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.500
They just do.

52
00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:17.110
Very nice. Thank you very much. Thank you.

53
00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:20.703
<v 4>[inaudible].</v>

54
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.740
<v 5>So here's the thing. That story got us started on a little journey.</v>

55
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.520
Truly began just thinking about wholeness and oneness and has looking for each

56
00:03:30.651 --> 00:03:35.410
other in all varieties of ways, mirrors and shapes, relationships.

57
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.150
Beauty, the birth of the universe, the nature of life.

58
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.180
All of these things either have a simple deep beauty or

59
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.173
<v 6>not.</v>

60
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.260
I'm Jad Abumrad I remember Krulwich this is Radiolab and today for this hour we

61
00:03:51.391 --> 00:03:56.220
are desperately seeking the symmetry.

62
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.980
By the way. That was Zoe Keating on cello.

63
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.860
We'll hear more from earth throughout the hour cause she's awesome.

64
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.370
Everybody. Kay [inaudible] I'm still thinking about our and he's okay. And uh,

65
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.210
you ever wonder, uh,

66
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.800
what actually happens when two people click when the haves kinda meat,

67
00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.860
meaning what? You know, you going through your day, maybe you're at a party.

68
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.440
Yeah. You meet people and you're like, hey, how are you? How are you?

69
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.380
And they say something,

70
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.500
they try and be interesting and you try and be interesting back.

71
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.680
But in the end you're like, damn, I don't need to remember that name. Right?

72
00:04:27.681 --> 00:04:28.610
Of course. Yeah, it's gone.

73
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.160
<v 3>And then comes along, somebody, every hundred dimes,</v>

74
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.600
the stars align, the world falls away. Things narrow and you just

75
00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.870
click. I know that.

76
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.210
Did you ever wonder what actually happens in that moment?

77
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.540
Like when you meet someone that you really get it? I just,

78
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.510
I don't think that there's anything that really feels better than that.

79
00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.290
That's Lauren silver. She's a neuroscientist at Princeton. She wonders,

80
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.640
she has been wondering for awhile and I was, I don't know, maybe eight.

81
00:04:59.641 --> 00:05:01.560
And I used to study with my dad.

82
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.570
We would go over things and I remember like I didn't understand this one like

83
00:05:06.571 --> 00:05:11.571
math problem and he was explaining it to me and all of a sudden and I got it and

84
00:05:12.751 --> 00:05:16.380
I started to cry and he got really nervous cause I was crying.

85
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.550
Why are you crying? Cause I was so excited that I like finally got it.

86
00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.540
That's my first memory of really like d excited about the intensity of

87
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.250
understanding. So fast forward 20 years,

88
00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.780
Lauren is a Princeton and in the basement of our building here.

89
00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:33.743
Can you just tell me where we are?

90
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.160
We are in the Fri facilities in Green Hall at Princeton University.

91
00:05:38.161 --> 00:05:40.830
They've got this giant brain scan, get magnet,

92
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:44.400
looks like an airplane engine will like a Donut, not pretty good donut.

93
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.580
And as you know with the scanner you can put people in it and have them do

94
00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:50.340
tasks. Think, think a thought or things, Huh?

95
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.540
Sing a song or watch a movie and a then the researchers can see into their

96
00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:58.340
brain, you know, without having to cut in there and got it into her head.

97
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.210
Could I use this big donut to investigate the clicking question?

98
00:06:02.211 --> 00:06:05.900
So is the question when things click, what clicks, what clicks?

99
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.930
And if we can know what clicks can we learn how to make it click more?

100
00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.600
So one day last year, Lauren got into the brain scanner,

101
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:20.660
I sort of like it in there and she told this story and you just tell me that

102
00:06:20.661 --> 00:06:24.470
story. Uh, well it's a 15 minute, come on. Okay.

103
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.330
So I told the story.

104
00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.870
Vert actually told you the whole thing without any sort of rehearsal fully,

105
00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.400
maybe for something,

106
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.440
something under 30 under 30 times.

107
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.970
I'm going to tell it one more time for everybody else. Play a loss.

108
00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.100
So the story is about her prompt.

109
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.300
So Lauren is in high school and this guy that she doesn't really like as you go

110
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:51.800
to the prompt, it's pretty awkward, but she's like, okay, you know,

111
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.620
didn't know what to say. Now subsequent to being asked by the first guy,

112
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.970
she actually falls for real for a second guy. Guy Number two.

113
00:06:58.971 --> 00:07:01.100
We just liked each other quick.

114
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.790
So now she has a situation cause she likes the second guy said yes,

115
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.020
the first guy and he still wants to be the day he wants to be. Oddly enough,

116
00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.790
he still wants to go there. So she ends up going with guy number one.

117
00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.850
So we get to the problem and a guy number two,

118
00:07:13.851 --> 00:07:16.130
her boyfriend shows up drunk,

119
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.850
very drunk and punches fly. It gets messy.

120
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.670
So she drags Gamer to her boyfriend out to the parking lot,

121
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:27.671
but on the way to the car he trips and falls directly on his face right onto his

122
00:07:28.851 --> 00:07:33.740
face on the concrete and he starts bleeding profusely.

123
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:37.490
So she's like, Oh give me your keys. I'm going to drive. I'll drive her car.

124
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.010
And she doesn't have a license but he can't drive.

125
00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.980
So she drives them both out of the parking lot.

126
00:07:42.981 --> 00:07:46.940
A couple of minutes later they come upon an accident in the street. Yeah,

127
00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.770
that's right there. Some cars had gone into a thing.

128
00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:50.990
So they're rolling up to it.

129
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:56.050
I get distracted and she crashes into the accident that had already happened and

130
00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.950
it's just that the police were already there and they're like, watch.

131
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:04.700
So the officer walks up, sees her no license,

132
00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:07.890
sees this dude who's all bloody and messy and was like, all right,

133
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.610
give me your registration. She thinks she's going to jail.

134
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:16.060
But here is where fate steps in as the officer is walking back to his car with

135
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:20.300
her registration, a wind, a lucky way. One of those kicks up,

136
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.510
blows the registration out of the officer's hands.

137
00:08:23.511 --> 00:08:28.160
He can't find it and he has no choice but to let her go. So then I just left.

138
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.470
So that was the story that forms the basis.

139
00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.490
That is the story that forms the basis of the pressure. Okay,

140
00:08:34.491 --> 00:08:37.760
so now let's rewind. So anyhow,

141
00:08:37.761 --> 00:08:40.280
she told that story in the scanner, all the while,

142
00:08:40.281 --> 00:08:44.210
the scanner snap pictures of her brain, moment to moment.

143
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.680
Then she got a bunch of other people,

144
00:08:45.681 --> 00:08:48.800
put them in the scanner and have the scanner snap pictures of their brain as

145
00:08:48.801 --> 00:08:52.910
they're listening to the story with me so far. Next,

146
00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:56.940
she compared brains. Okay,

147
00:08:56.941 --> 00:08:58.680
so here I can show you a,

148
00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:03.960
Lauren showed us brain scans where she divided each brain into thousands of tiny

149
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:08.340
little squares. So we called voxels thousands. Thousands. Yeah.

150
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.320
So then what we can do is we can take one box or in one brain and directly

151
00:09:13.321 --> 00:09:18.110
compare it to the same exact vox or in the other brain. Shut up.

152
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.060
Wow. And we do this across the entire brain.

153
00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:27.100
<v 6>And this is where things get interesting when people really got her story,</v>

154
00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.640
because she had run them through all these tests to see if they could remember

155
00:09:30.641 --> 00:09:32.830
the different chapters, the word she used.

156
00:09:32.831 --> 00:09:35.160
So she was checking to see how well they listened. Yeah.

157
00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:37.450
She would have them kind of recall the story of them.

158
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.840
Some were really good at recalling others, not so much. Now,

159
00:09:40.841 --> 00:09:42.910
the people that did well, like really well,

160
00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:45.340
she found that as they were listening to her story,

161
00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:49.090
their brain would literally begin to mirror hers.

162
00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:53.560
All the little voxels in their head would start to sync up with all the little

163
00:09:53.561 --> 00:09:57.160
voxels in her head. So they're, so they're just listening.

164
00:09:57.161 --> 00:09:58.810
Like anyone listening, just hearing [inaudible]

165
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:02.210
<v 0>you're saying it again? I get that. No, no.</v>

166
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.750
Let me put it to you a different way. You're right. I mean,

167
00:10:05.751 --> 00:10:09.260
right now you and I are voxels are mirroring each other. You know,

168
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.410
we're both speaking English. Yeah. So we can assume,

169
00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:17.360
say 20% at least I would go 23, 24 let's say 24. Okay.

170
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.110
But let's say you bump it up to 30, maybe bump it up to 35.

171
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.490
Let's get a little higher. 40 42 48,

172
00:10:25.491 --> 00:10:28.940
49 at a 50% left.

173
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:31.550
But let's say we get to 50%, even 60.

174
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:35.780
There's a certain point at which something happens where it's no longer me just

175
00:10:35.781 --> 00:10:37.760
describing an experience to you.

176
00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.780
It's you actually having the experience, you know, uh,

177
00:10:42.490 --> 00:10:47.490
like you know that the difference between ex explanation and experience is like

178
00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.760
the Grand Canyon, right? Well she's found a way to quantify the gap.

179
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:57.140
So when I'm sitting there listening to Meryl Streep, I'm all Merrill inside,

180
00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:01.460
outside and all around. Yeah, that's 100% Merrill without lasting,

181
00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.480
that's 100% Merrill Street. He is not listening to this. You were saying,

182
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:06.520
I'll give you an example of [inaudible].

183
00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.560
<v 3>I was just saying here, let me show you. So while I was in Lauren's office,</v>

184
00:11:10.561 --> 00:11:14.130
she showed me this particular slide of her results.

185
00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.650
So on this side we have this comprehension rank and what that means basically is

186
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:19.141
a graph.

187
00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:23.520
And on one axis shoot she had how much they actually understood the story and

188
00:11:23.521 --> 00:11:24.354
could recall it.

189
00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.350
And on the other axis she had how much their brain sinked up with hers,

190
00:11:28.351 --> 00:11:31.530
which is sort of like how much they experienced the story. What are these marks,

191
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:34.590
by the way? Are these people, sorry about the way these,

192
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:40.860
oh, these are individual subjects. So if you take out this one outlier,

193
00:11:40.861 --> 00:11:41.460
actually,

194
00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:44.700
she pointed to this one subject who was way on one side of the graph because

195
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:49.350
that person is just didn't get your story at all. No, this person actually,

196
00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:53.530
that person did understand her story score really nice on comprehension but just

197
00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:56.840
didn't sync up with her brain at all. This person. Yeah.

198
00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.073
Um,

199
00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:04.790
this person I t well,

200
00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.180
so this is a little interesting tidbit.

201
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:13.940
I know this person, you know this person, I know this person. Yeah.

202
00:12:14.330 --> 00:12:18.800
Hm. To that person. I'm almost positive is her fiance. Yeah,

203
00:12:18.801 --> 00:12:22.490
it was, there were some fights in gesture for real.

204
00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:27.800
I mean for real. I don't think he was actually paying attention.

205
00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.830
Um, but this one up here, she pointed to another subject.

206
00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:37.640
Oh the way on the other side of the graph, who is a super brain coupling.

207
00:12:37.641 --> 00:12:42.110
Master a was a, a girl in Undergrad who I had never met before.

208
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:43.280
Um,

209
00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:48.280
and her brain coupled with my brain was twice as much as everybody else.

210
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:55.150
I mean really just like I contacted her after cause I wanted to like have lunch

211
00:12:56.301 --> 00:12:58.850
with her and just see for the same person or not.

212
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:07.790
And you never got back to me. What I know is not really,

213
00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:13.060
it was sort of the end of their semester and I think she might've been away in

214
00:13:13.431 --> 00:13:14.930
the weeks after I spoke with Lauren.

215
00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:17.270
We emailed a few times and I kept asking her. I was like,

216
00:13:17.271 --> 00:13:20.430
so what about that girl? The one who knew everything? Yeah,

217
00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.470
like how do you explain the connection? Is it a connection?

218
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.740
[inaudible] he didn't want to know. She did actually.

219
00:13:27.741 --> 00:13:30.170
And we started referring to the girl on email as a

220
00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:33.230
<v 6>BD media, meaning what? Meaning?</v>

221
00:13:33.231 --> 00:13:37.320
Brain Double Bidi Bidi Bidi Bidi Bidi Bidi Bidi [inaudible] bring a little,

222
00:13:37.321 --> 00:13:38.390
bring the book here. Anyhow,

223
00:13:38.391 --> 00:13:41.990
eventually after two weeks of constant emailing and searching,

224
00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.380
BD turns up and agrees to me.

225
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:53.750
<v 3>The meeting took place on a sunny Tuesday afternoon at Princeton and I missed it</v>

226
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:57.670
because I was on the wrong train. When I finally get there,

227
00:13:57.671 --> 00:14:01.600
BD has come and gone. So you never laid eyes on BD? I did not,

228
00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.940
but I talked to Lauren right after she had,

229
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.940
it was weird really. We sat down on a bench and she gave me the skill. Okay.

230
00:14:09.941 --> 00:14:14.500
You seem a little shaken. Yeah, it was a strange experience.

231
00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.200
First thing she tells me is what the mystery girl's name is. Her name. Lauren.

232
00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.320
My name is la. She was Lauren. And you were Lauren? Yes.

233
00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:26.530
We're both named Lauren. Wow. I know. It's weird,

234
00:14:26.531 --> 00:14:30.280
but there's clients out there. I know, but still, that's so weird.

235
00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.230
At this point I'm like, I mean,

236
00:14:32.231 --> 00:14:36.010
this was like an error stuff and he's whopper here, folks. So I was thinking,

237
00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:40.510
and that's what Lauren told me, that she had been expecting to beforehand.

238
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:44.830
I was expecting her to come in and just be me.

239
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:50.350
And when she showed up with she, you know, not at all.

240
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.883
Yeah.

241
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.880
<v 6>Earlier they admitted to coffee shop and a, since I'd missed the whole thing,</v>

242
00:14:55.881 --> 00:14:59.870
I was very lucky that more number one had recorded the meeting on her laptop.

243
00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.500
Okay. So I want to know, did you, where did you grow up?

244
00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:07.340
I grew up in Vancouver. C in Vancouver. Yeah.

245
00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:11.360
Loren one's theory was that they would have a common background or common,

246
00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:14.150
something that would explain the symmetry between them.

247
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:19.210
But what you hear Lauren one, I'm looking for points of connection and uh,

248
00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.080
consider yourself well listen. Okay. Do you have prom in Canada?

249
00:15:24.170 --> 00:15:28.330
Is that a stupid question? Well we do. I actually couldn't go to mine.

250
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:32.660
You didn't go to your prom? Yeah. Okay. Uh, I wish I could.

251
00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.600
Did you, um,

252
00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:40.430
did you have like significant relationships in high school? No.

253
00:15:40.431 --> 00:15:44.270
No, not at all. I went to an all girls school. You went to an all girls school?

254
00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:49.160
Yeah. Did you have to wear a unicorn? Yeah. Was it like happen in the end?

255
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:53.680
There was not one thing they had in common except their names and

256
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.800
<v 7>Princeton. Do you thought that this was going to be, you know, something?</v>

257
00:15:57.801 --> 00:16:01.620
I don't know. Is it, maybe your premise is wrong. What do you mean? Well,

258
00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:03.981
actually I eat,

259
00:16:03.981 --> 00:16:07.140
snuck up to Columbia University and I asked her neuroscientist about this

260
00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.690
actually. When did you do that while you were in Princeton?

261
00:16:09.691 --> 00:16:12.280
I was on the subway going up to see Joey her. Hi.

262
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:16.680
Nice to meet you went behind my back. What happened is I said to her, look,

263
00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:20.670
we have this pretty great paper, and she agreed. It was a wonderful paper.

264
00:16:20.671 --> 00:16:23.850
I said, it shows these two women who has seemed to be in such lock step.

265
00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.510
Wouldn't you suppose that the two of them, if they ever met,

266
00:16:27.511 --> 00:16:30.420
would become friendly or have some connection? Yeah.

267
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:35.700
<v 8>You come to the same conclusion if yours and my heartbeats were exactly the</v>

268
00:16:36.021 --> 00:16:36.854
same.

269
00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.080
<v 7>Depends on the circumstances.</v>

270
00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:44.730
If it was a beautiful night at a sinking moon in Venice, maybe

271
00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:51.810
<v 8>yes. You have elaborated the story beyond my question.</v>

272
00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:57.230
Say Your heartbeat is about 62 beats per minute. Same.

273
00:16:57.231 --> 00:17:00.270
Mine was exactly 62 beats per minute.

274
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:04.830
Would you say that we were more in sync than if mine was 72 beats per minute

275
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:10.970
<v 7>that you and I were more soulmates? No, probably not. Well, I don't want to,</v>

276
00:17:10.971 --> 00:17:14.120
but I, I don't know if I, you see, I would want to, don't you want to,

277
00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.430
when you see synchrony between individuals?

278
00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:18.240
<v 8>Well, yes,</v>

279
00:17:18.241 --> 00:17:22.920
but I'm saying that I think that the conclusion doesn't follow from the data.

280
00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:28.290
Joy says it's equally possible that Lauren too is just an extraordinarily good

281
00:17:28.740 --> 00:17:29.573
listener.

282
00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:33.750
<v 6>Hello? Hey. Hey. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, I can hear you. In fact,</v>

283
00:17:33.751 --> 00:17:36.420
when I finally got Lauren to on the phone, uh,

284
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:41.100
she did tell me that she is one of those people that when she hears a story,

285
00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:43.500
she just falls in

286
00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:47.730
<v 9>to the point where somebody can be a [inaudible].</v>

287
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:53.220
And I don't it because I'm so focused on it. But yeah. Um,

288
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:58.410
how do I explain it? So have you ever done any, any sports?

289
00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:00.830
<v 0>Yah. Soccer a little bit. Yeah.</v>

290
00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:03.700
<v 9>Do you ever find that sometimes when you're playing soccer,</v>

291
00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.260
you are so into the game?

292
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:11.200
Are you just reacting or whatever that you kind of lose track of yourself for a

293
00:18:11.201 --> 00:18:11.710
little bit?

294
00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:13.170
<v 0>Yeah. It's like a dream state almost.</v>

295
00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:17.380
<v 9>Yeah, like a dream state. I definitely have that happen when I'm doing for it,</v>

296
00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:20.600
but I also sometimes have that happened when I, and I read

297
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.510
<v 0>even. So do you think that you and Lauren one will become friends?</v>

298
00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.970
<v 9>Um, I</v>

299
00:18:28.650 --> 00:18:30.840
honestly probably,

300
00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:32.320
<v 7>no. No,</v>

301
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:33.283
<v 1>no.</v>

302
00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.450
<v 0>Um, I, I mean we're just,</v>

303
00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:41.880
<v 1>yeah, it's just, I just don't, I wouldn't, I would just want it,</v>

304
00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:43.813
but she's you

305
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:48.380
<v 7>but not you. Don't you want to hang out with or don't you need to know her? No.</v>

306
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:52.610
Okay. Thank you very much. Why don't you just sit down just for a second.

307
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.460
We're going to play a little nobody off I think, but there's more. Come on.

308
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.630
I think we can just repair all the damage that is just acute to your sensitive

309
00:18:59.631 --> 00:19:02.290

326
00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:05.150
<v 0>Our country continues to grapple with the deep cultural divisions exposed by the</v>

327
00:20:05.151 --> 00:20:06.560
2016 elections.

328
00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:12.140
[inaudible] there is some palpable change in how people are looking at as well.

329
00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.790
Maybe how we are looking at people.

330
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.830
W and YC is talking to a broad range of Americans about how we arrived at this

331
00:20:18.831 --> 00:20:21.290
moment in our political culture. I'm Kai,

332
00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.050
right subscribed to the United States of anxiety,

333
00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:28.520
culture wars from wny sea studios, wherever you get your podcasts,

334
00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:38.770
Chai reality, take 30,000 yeah, yeah.

335
00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.790
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich,

336
00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:45.050
Radiolab and today we are desperately seeking symmetry.

337
00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:49.240
Thus far we are failing desperately because maybe, maybe, you know, if we took,

338
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:53.710
if we rejiggered our whole approach because symmetry no is really about love.

339
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:58.180
No, it's it's way. Even though we're changing the subject now.

340
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:03.240
It's about the way things look when they're flipped around or turned or rotated.

341
00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:07.580
And this is where it gets really interesting. Reflected, reflected, yes.

342
00:21:07.581 --> 00:21:09.860
Reflected because there was a map affected. Yes.

343
00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:14.450
There was a mathematician at Oxford University named Charles Latoya. AJ Datsun.

344
00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:18.080
There's a mathy named for you. Well, he had a different name as it happens.

345
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:23.240
What? Lewis Carroll. Oh, like the Alice in wonderland. The Alice in wonderland.

346
00:21:23.241 --> 00:21:26.470
Dude, he is a mathematician. He was, I had really didn't know that.

347
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:29.380
Did you know that he wrote another book called through the looking glass?

348
00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:31.600
Truthfully, I didn't know they were different books. You know,

349
00:21:31.601 --> 00:21:32.900
very little in this particular section,

350
00:21:33.610 --> 00:21:38.080
but there's a part of the book where Alice is standing in her room talking to

351
00:21:38.081 --> 00:21:38.914
her cat.

352
00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:43.270
Now if you'll only attend kitty and not talk so much,

353
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.470
I'll tell you all about my ideas about looking glass house.

354
00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:50.650
This is Natasha gastric reading in in this section of the book,

355
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:52.320
Alice is telling her cat like,

356
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.840
let's take a look at the difference between our world and that world right there

357
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.760
in the mirror. That's just the same as our drawing them.

358
00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.910
Only the things go the other way.

359
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:06.700
The books are something like our books, only the words go the wrong way.

360
00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:11.850
I know that because I've had at one of our books to the glass and then they hold

361
00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.060
that one in the other room.

362
00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.950
<v 1>How would you like to live in a looking glass house? Katie?</v>

363
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.290
I one day. If, if you look in that

364
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.210
paps looking glass, milk isn't good to drink.

365
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:30.470
Perhaps your milk isn't good to drink.

366
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:36.030
<v 0>Why you? Why you dug in like that and what does that even mean? Well,</v>

367
00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.840
you just stick with me on this. I think I will make it [inaudible]

368
00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.350
<v 2>physically clear. Okay. This is a very, as it turns out, yes.</v>

369
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.160
Difficult scientific question. Yes. They call it a [inaudible]. Okay. What?

370
00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:49.000
This is Neil degrasse Tyson, n. E. I. L.

371
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.180
Degress small d e capital g. R. A. S. S. E. Tyson.

372
00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.090
He's an astrophysicist with the American Museum of Natural History,

373
00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:58.510
also the director of the Hayden Planetarium. Cool. And what is that?

374
00:22:58.511 --> 00:23:02.080
What is [inaudible]? Well, it's when you make a molecule,

375
00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:06.040
there's no rule or law that says it has to be symmetric. Neil says,

376
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:08.410
if you zoom into that bowl of milk,

377
00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:12.100
what you're gonna find is just chains of atoms that are stuck together in a very

378
00:23:12.101 --> 00:23:16.870
particular shape and that shape, it could curl in a particular way.

379
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:21.010
So for example, if you have a spring and you turn your finger in the direction,

380
00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.110
the spring, spring, like a coil, a coil,

381
00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:26.910
but like the spring out of your click pen, pull off that spring. All right,

382
00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:30.250
we have a pen right here under your pen. Pull it out and got the spring out.

383
00:23:30.251 --> 00:23:33.790
Here we go. And look at the way the spring turns. Nothing.

384
00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.940
You got to spray and move your finger in the direction utter in moving.

385
00:23:36.941 --> 00:23:39.400
My finger is turning clockwise

386
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.090
all the way up to the top. Okay?

387
00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.610
That spring is that way in

388
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:50.390
<v 7>it's life. Whether it's right side up or upside down, it doesn't matter.</v>

389
00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:55.130
Always clockwise. But if you had a mirror jad you happen to have something.

390
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:57.500
Do I have a mirror? No. [inaudible] take your phone.

391
00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:01.810
Has that reflected the shiny thing. Okay. Put Your um,

392
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:04.420
spring in front of the shiny surface of the phone. Okay.

393
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.520
Trace the spring with your finger and tell me which direction is your finger

394
00:24:07.521 --> 00:24:11.270
going? Collect wise? No, we already did this in the reflection. Oh,

395
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:14.390
in the phone to Kinda tell but no phone.

396
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:19.280
It's going the opposite way. Yes. Counter-Clockwise. Exactly.

397
00:24:19.281 --> 00:24:23.360
And so now you have two opposite oppositely turned springs.

398
00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.250
You cannot turn one into the other.

399
00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:30.170
They're built differently yet they are curiously identical. Yeah.

400
00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:33.350
So since molecules are just sequences of Adams,

401
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.270
imagine a molecule that has that shape.

402
00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:39.170
If you put that molecule in front of the mirror, just the same as the spring,

403
00:24:39.171 --> 00:24:43.700
you've got now two molecules built differently, but curiously identical,

404
00:24:43.701 --> 00:24:44.800
blah, blah, blah.

405
00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.980
Kind of like your right hand and your left hand,

406
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:52.190
your left hand and your right hand are related by a mirror image.

407
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.920
It's the same thing with these molecules. This is Marcelo Gleiser.

408
00:24:54.921 --> 00:24:57.860
He's a physicist at Dartmouth college and according to Marcello,

409
00:24:57.861 --> 00:25:01.200
this is how scientists talk about molecules. They call them, right?

410
00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.900
We use these. Sometimes we call it a hand in there.

411
00:25:03.901 --> 00:25:08.901
Sometimes you get a little more fancy and we call it Chi or Allity because Cairo

412
00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.390
Kiros in Greek means hand and Marcelo says,

413
00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:16.310
if you look at pebbles or granted or cement inanimate stuff,

414
00:25:16.490 --> 00:25:18.740
when you look at the shape of things inside,

415
00:25:18.741 --> 00:25:23.450
it's a mixture of the two 50% lefthanded, 50% right-handed.

416
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:27.440
However, if you look at all the proteins of living things,

417
00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.730
they're always lefthanded and no right-handed at all.

418
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:36.980
Really wife has chosen one over the other life as we know it has chosen.

419
00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.900
When scientists look inside of living things, they, that they always see it.

420
00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:44.510
The molecules are pointing one way. Yeah. Right. So somehow,

421
00:25:44.511 --> 00:25:46.130
and this is what's really amazing,

422
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:51.400
somehow life is choosing a very specific shape for the molecules to make up

423
00:25:52.851 --> 00:25:55.880
stuff. That's correct. When you say life has chosen,

424
00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:58.580
let's take that sentence apart.

425
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.950
Life meaning everything that is that we know of on earth, every living thing,

426
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:07.790
hence my phrase, life as we know it, everything. That's what that means.

427
00:26:07.791 --> 00:26:11.060
The littlest things to the blue whale that would be as we know,

428
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:15.050
the littlest clean new thing to the street, the biggest tree,

429
00:26:15.051 --> 00:26:19.730
the giant sequoia, that would be as we know, every protein in you,

430
00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:25.120
<v 5>dogs, trees, you name it. It's filled with left-handed building blocks. Yes.</v>

431
00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:29.530
It's called the [inaudible] of life. The Chi reality of life life.

432
00:26:29.531 --> 00:26:31.840
My friend is left hinted.

433
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.510
[inaudible] that's pretty, that's a well it feels cool, but, and let me just,

434
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:39.940
uh, like so what

435
00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.040
<v 7>I mean, I don't want to put it bluntly, but I mean w well other than the</v>

436
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.580
<v 0>sheer surprise of having everything in life being shaped and when directing,</v>

437
00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:50.550
but I mean, what does it have to do with my life? Well,

438
00:26:50.551 --> 00:26:52.700
this bringing one's life, this brings us backing.

439
00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:57.090
This brings us back to the mirror mystery and Alice in the mirror and milk. No,

440
00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.460
no, because you, because you just told me that,

441
00:26:59.461 --> 00:27:03.120
that the milk is left-handed because milk is an Ocala living cow. Yeah.

442
00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.690
Remember you said that life is lefty [inaudible] so there can't be any

443
00:27:06.691 --> 00:27:08.580
right-handed milk. So the mirror milk doesn't exist.

444
00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:12.330
Well that's because I forgot to tell you that scientists all the time

445
00:27:12.331 --> 00:27:16.440
manufacture mirror molecules. They do. Yeah. Yeah.

446
00:27:16.441 --> 00:27:20.730
They go into their laboratories and they synthetically make mirror molecules of

447
00:27:20.731 --> 00:27:24.930
all kinds of things. Can they do milk? Mironov about milk in particular.

448
00:27:24.931 --> 00:27:28.560
But I do know that when I talked to an Oxford professor, Marcus does a toy,

449
00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:33.810
right? Yeah. He told me, if you take the atoms which built caraway seeds,

450
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.290
which is the space they use in Rye bread, take a mirror image of them.

451
00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.740
Suddenly you get something which tastes of Spearman, Huh?

452
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.900
Is What's put on Wrigley spearmint gum. And in fact,

453
00:27:42.901 --> 00:27:46.920
there are some very dramatic examples of this, not just where the taste changes,

454
00:27:46.921 --> 00:27:48.750
but um, uh,

455
00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:52.110
listeners might remember a story about the thalidomide drug.

456
00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:59.040
<v 12>In 1958, a West German pharmaceutical firm began marketing a new drug.</v>

457
00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:01.260
<v 0>This is a new spot from the early 1960s.</v>

458
00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.540
<v 12>He said it though so effective and apparently harmless.</v>

459
00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:07.750
It quickly became one of the most widely used and prescribed drugs in west

460
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:08.680
Europe, illegitimate

461
00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:13.070
<v 0>before long pregnant women started taking it as a way to come. Morning sickness.</v>

462
00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.280
And most of us, well, we know what happened next.

463
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:21.470
Every a woman President Kennedy in a press conference in this country, I think,

464
00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:24.980
uh, must be aware that it's most important that they take this drug,

465
00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.820
that they turn it in every citizen. Of course, I should be aware of the hazards.

466
00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:33.650
All in all more than 12,000 children were born with arms and legs that were

467
00:28:33.651 --> 00:28:36.320
shortened or deformed or completely missing.

468
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:41.290
The strange thing according to Marcus is that we now know they're the drunk.

469
00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:44.210
When they first made the [inaudible] it was all one hand,

470
00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:45.640
let's say it's was left handed. Yeah.

471
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:49.850
And it did actually cure me with morning sickness and was completely harmless.

472
00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:54.020
But somewhere along the way, thalidomide flipped.

473
00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:58.430
We don't know whether this was in the drug making process or after,

474
00:28:58.431 --> 00:29:02.360
but we do know it's mirror image was incredibly poisonous.

475
00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:09.670
So you know what this means jet in a show about symmetry.

476
00:29:09.671 --> 00:29:14.590
What we've just discovered is that life itself is actually deeply asymmetric.

477
00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:17.970
Yeah. Unlike love where we started the program back with, um,

478
00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:22.720
Aristophanes when it comes to life, you don't want to meet the other half,

479
00:29:22.721 --> 00:29:26.350
stay away, may run the other way away. Anyhow,

480
00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.890
that's well enough about me or no, no, no, no, no.

481
00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:34.220
I think we can take this another step further. There is no further, I mean,

482
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:39.230
because something about this chemistry reflections thing resonates for me with

483
00:29:40.421 --> 00:29:42.040
the actual experience of standing in

484
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.270
<v 6>front of a mirror. How will you know, you look at that guy and you're like, Eh,</v>

485
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.831
oof. I mean,

486
00:29:47.831 --> 00:29:50.980
we talked about this on stage actually in d c at the Shakespeare theater.

487
00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:55.720
Remember when I asked you that personal question? Do you want to do that?

488
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:59.040
Oh yes, we do. Psychologically. Let me ask psychologically, do you,

489
00:29:59.041 --> 00:30:00.430
do you enjoy looking in the mirror?

490
00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.720
Is that a question you want to ask me in front of the,

491
00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:09.520
I thought that's a private question. I, you surely,

492
00:30:09.521 --> 00:30:11.160
you know though that you are, uh,

493
00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:16.090
the difference between your true self and your mirror itself is not trivial.

494
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:19.810
My true. What did you mean by my true self? I don't know. Well,

495
00:30:19.811 --> 00:30:24.010
I'm going to tell you the story now. Okay. About a guy named John Walter. Oh,

496
00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:26.880
the, with the Luma staff from Baltimore, from the movies, you know,

497
00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.380
that's John Waters. Walter.

498
00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:32.230
He's a computer programmer in new Rochelle.

499
00:30:32.231 --> 00:30:36.400
Paid him a visit recently cause back when he was in college he sorta kindness

500
00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:40.210
switched places with the guy in the mirror. It was many years ago.

501
00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:43.240
How old were you? I was 19, 19. So it was a long time ago.

502
00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.440
We're talking late seventies here, but I was um, uh,

503
00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:49.960
had already had some issues with the mirror. So let me set this up for you.

504
00:30:49.961 --> 00:30:53.770
The thing to know about John is that as a kid he had a tough time.

505
00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:57.760
Like so many of us, he would get bullied, beaten up on the playground.

506
00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:01.570
It was no better when he got into his teens. And as a 19 year old,

507
00:31:01.571 --> 00:31:06.571
his social life consisted of a series of stinging humiliations like the

508
00:31:06.971 --> 00:31:11.590
following. I remember at the time there was a lot of um, kids hanging out.

509
00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:15.130
You know, there was a crew of people like, you know, 20, 30,

510
00:31:15.131 --> 00:31:19.270
40 kids would gather together at the aqueduct beautiful words that have the

511
00:31:19.271 --> 00:31:22.990
aqueduct and go drink beers and smoke cigarettes. You know,

512
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:26.680
I've walked into the group, I care what's up. And it's like, yeah, whatever.

513
00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:33.640
Roundly rejected and that according to John was normal.

514
00:31:33.641 --> 00:31:37.180
That was normal. Very normal. Like people would say,

515
00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.430
what's that guy doing here? Yeah,

516
00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:43.780
maybe he was like wearing the wrong plaid pants or had like, you know,

517
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:46.630
mismatch socks. They might be something, whatever. Don't you emphasize?

518
00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:47.710
I of course with this guy,

519
00:31:47.770 --> 00:31:51.340
nobody wants to be 19 and be the yucky person in class. I would input however,

520
00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:56.430
the story that will follow centers on a revelation that John had that uh,

521
00:31:56.530 --> 00:32:00.280
began just as he was about to start his summer job for con Ed.

522
00:32:00.281 --> 00:32:04.450
I was working for them as a painter and I had some pictures taken for con Ed.

523
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.810
These are id photos that you guys have an ID camera that had four lenses.

524
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:11.860
So when they took the negative, there was four of me. Boom, boom, boom, boom.

525
00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:16.360
Like little squares, squares. And I remember looking over and, and, and going,

526
00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.370
why do I look so weird?

527
00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.330
<v 5>Why do it look so weird? Why? Why did it look so weird?</v>

528
00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:24.740
Because here's the thing. I mean,

529
00:32:24.741 --> 00:32:29.741
the John in the pictures was not the John that he knew himself to be,

530
00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:34.610
that John was kinda timid and nerdy. Not Cool.

531
00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:39.230
Why do I look so weird in pictures? I look fine. What do you mean you look fine?

532
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:40.250
Do you know? You look fine.

533
00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.800
<v 6>Well, I thought I looked fine in the mirror. You know,</v>

534
00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:45.200
and when I looked at my course in the mirror, things on the left,

535
00:32:45.201 --> 00:32:48.200
go to the right things on the right. Go to the left. Wait a second.

536
00:32:48.201 --> 00:32:51.350
That's when it hit him. What? What hit him?

537
00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:57.380
It's the hair apart. It's the what?

538
00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.880
It's the hair part. It's the what? It's the hair part.

539
00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:05.000
I could do this all night. It's the hair part. What does that mean? It's the,

540
00:33:05.001 --> 00:33:08.060
hey, I hear it. I hear it. I'd be like, what's that? You eat the hair part.

541
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:11.690
Well, in the picture, I saw a guy with a right hair part in the mirror.

542
00:33:11.691 --> 00:33:16.290
I seen the guy with the left hair part essentially John, wait, which part?

543
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:19.390
Which side am I here? Part it on. Is Your left your left? My left. Okay.

544
00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.050
John Thought he was a lefty too.

545
00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.660
He would stand in front of the mirror and the mirror would tell him he was

546
00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:25.250
parting it to the left,

547
00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.280
but in fact he was partying it to the right in real life.

548
00:33:28.281 --> 00:33:31.970
Now the lefty guy in the mirror, he liked that guy. I was fine with that guy.

549
00:33:31.971 --> 00:33:33.980
He was cool. He was, there was nothing wrong with him,

550
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:39.140
but he realized he was the only person seeing that guy. So we thought,

551
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.930
Oh, let me put my hair on the other side.

552
00:33:41.931 --> 00:33:45.950
Let me essentially swap real me for mirror me.

553
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:49.070
It was one of these things where, yeah, that looks really weird in the mirror,

554
00:33:49.071 --> 00:33:52.370
but at Betcha it looks good in real life. Let me go find out.

555
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:55.190
What did you do well that night

556
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:58.120
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

557
00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:01.910
<v 6>it goes back to the aqueduct. Same posse is there as before</v>

558
00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:03.750
<v 13>that same group. Interesting enough,</v>

559
00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:07.410
had beat the crap out of me like three years earlier when I was in like ninth

560
00:34:07.411 --> 00:34:07.900
grade,

561
00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:11.150
<v 6>but there he was now with his hair parted on the left. He says,</v>

562
00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:14.290
this time things were different. Somebody offered him a beer.

563
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:15.220
<v 13>Well was like, wow.</v>

564
00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:19.540
But the thing that I knew made it better was when I left,

565
00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.520
I got goodbyes.

566
00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:25.240
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

567
00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.700
<v 6>come on. My God, I Look God for the first time. I'm, no,</v>

568
00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:31.780
this is ridiculous that you would tell me a story about a man who is having

569
00:34:31.781 --> 00:34:36.640
social failures. University shifts. His Arrow is remade. This is like,

570
00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:41.170
it's his experience. It's very easy to dismiss,

571
00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.750
but when you already, are you ready? I'm going to win you over.

572
00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:46.510
You're not ready for this. I don't think you're ready. Are you ready?

573
00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.840
If you are asking me to be [inaudible],

574
00:34:49.020 --> 00:34:53.260
I'm going to show you a picture right now. All right. Okay. Have a look at,

575
00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:58.270
okay. At who is that? It's Abraham Lincoln, our 16th president.

576
00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:01.690
[inaudible] private. Take him in. Taking deep into your consciousness.

577
00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:03.010
By the way. This next part,

578
00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.830
you can see the pictures@radiolab.org it's worth checking out. All right.

579
00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:11.740
His eyes, his nose, his mouth. Pay attention particularly to the hair part.

580
00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:16.690
Okay, now look what happens when you flip Abraham.

581
00:35:20.690 --> 00:35:21.523
<v 4>Oh, that.</v>

582
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:26.940
<v 6>No, no, no, no, no, no. Guys. Is this the same picture? Picture?</v>

583
00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:31.150
Go back to the other picture. Go. Alright, here's a, now we'll do the other one.

584
00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:34.840
Oh, you see so weird. No. Here's the thing.

585
00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:38.550
This is what Abraham Lincoln would have when he looked in the mirror.

586
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:43.470
He would have seen this guy, not the other guy. The one we all see. Huh?

587
00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.620
So there's something going on you. Would you not at least acknowledge me?

588
00:35:46.621 --> 00:35:50.940
They find this. Okay, with your permission,

589
00:35:50.941 --> 00:35:51.840
Mr Sinek,

590
00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:56.790
I will now rejoin John Who's about to get married and have three babies cause

591
00:35:56.910 --> 00:36:00.780
his hair. He says after, after he switched his part,

592
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:03.480
it just kept getting better and better and better all summer long.

593
00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:05.580
He was suddenly invited to all of these parties,

594
00:36:05.581 --> 00:36:08.730
but the very same people used to beat him up and for the first time he says

595
00:36:08.731 --> 00:36:11.040
clearly one of them. Now, whether you're not you buy that,

596
00:36:11.041 --> 00:36:13.560
this is in fact because of his hair that's on you. Okay,

597
00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:16.290
but let's fast forward just a little bit. The next summer,

598
00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:21.320
this would have been 1979 and 1979 John sitting in front of the TV and on comes.

599
00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:26.800
<v 14>Good evening. This is a special night for me. The precedent Jimmy Carter</v>

600
00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:29.410
<v 6>making a speech about how our nation is in a deep</v>

601
00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:29.891
<v 14>fuck.</v>

602
00:36:29.891 --> 00:36:34.891
Why have we not been able to get together as a nation to resolve our serious

603
00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:37.730
energy problems? Then malaise speech.

604
00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:42.820
You know that that infamous countries in malaise clear that the true problems of

605
00:36:43.241 --> 00:36:45.970
our nation, a much deeper,

606
00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:50.080
deeper than gasoline lines or energy shortages,

607
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:52.540
deeper even than inflation

608
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:54.020
<v 6>session. Now, as you know,</v>

609
00:36:54.021 --> 00:36:57.320
I'm sure you remember a lot of people would criticize Jimmy Carter for making

610
00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:00.560
the speech because he's up there admitting flaws and they were like,

611
00:37:00.561 --> 00:37:04.310
come on Mr President. Don't be weak man up John.

612
00:37:04.311 --> 00:37:08.420
Meanwhile is sitting in front of the TV and he's thinking, dude,

613
00:37:08.421 --> 00:37:09.740
you gotta change your hair part.

614
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:12.680
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

615
00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:15.270
<v 6>and so I wrote him, cause I wrote to him, I wrote to him, wait, wait.</v>

616
00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.820
So you said, wait,

617
00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:21.400
what is why I think I just said I think you should change your hair. Pardon?

618
00:37:21.401 --> 00:37:25.180
On the on the left I did myself and found it to be much more powerful, much,

619
00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:30.250
much more successful. And um, that six, I so wish I did. I don't have it.

620
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.980
Um, and then about six weeks later, boom, he twitched. He switched. No, he,

621
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:37.920
John wrote him a letter and President Carter switched.

622
00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.630
Now it might not have been John's letter that didn't have no evidence.

623
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:44.320
Thinking about how much, what's involved in a president switching his hair.

624
00:37:44.321 --> 00:37:46.750
There are focus groups. There are prayer meetings.

625
00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:50.890
There's so much thought that goes into the, did anyone actually record this?

626
00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:56.640
They did. I will. I will now read you a journalistic account from no, no.

627
00:37:56.820 --> 00:38:00.430
P A periodical. There you go. Washington book right there.

628
00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:04.900
You see Bam right there. Oh Man. Newsweek,

629
00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.400
May 7th, 1979 at first, photographers thought they had their negatives reversed,

630
00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:11.870
but no, Jimmy Carter has changed the partner,

631
00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:14.080
his hair from the right side to the left,

632
00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:17.130
the Washington press score demanded an explanation,

633
00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:18.663
<v 4>buck</v>

634
00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:23.600
<v 6>silver that, you know, as opposed to John who changes it here.</v>

635
00:38:23.601 --> 00:38:26.030
And then all the girls give them beers. This guy,

636
00:38:26.031 --> 00:38:29.330
he was running against a luxuriantly haired man,

637
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:34.300
the Reagan and it didn't matter. So he just, you know, we got crushed. Right.

638
00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:37.310
You know what? Forget smart. Forget the executive branch. Yeah,

639
00:38:37.311 --> 00:38:38.360
stay with me now. Um,

640
00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:42.670
I was with John and he was showing me pictures of congressmen and of celebrities

641
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:46.570
and uh, I noticed something peaking out at the bottom of the pile.

642
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:50.740
I see peaking out on beneath the stack of photos as a superman. Yeah.

643
00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:56.080
Show me a picture of Superman looking mighty in his superman suit.

644
00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:00.400
Notice how he parts his hair. It's a little bit on there. On that side. Yeah.

645
00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.350
Now this is Clark Kent.

646
00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:11.200
And as we know from the movies, Clark Kent is fumbling sort of a dork.

647
00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.740
I was at first, really nervous about tonight.

648
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:20.190
So somebody who made that movie maybe explicitly intuitively understood

649
00:39:21.191 --> 00:39:24.450
something about the difference that maybe you know the right parts said.

650
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:27.520
One thing about Clark Kent, the left part said something about superman.

651
00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:28.443
In fact,

652
00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:32.740
there is a scene in the movie where Clark Kent's running down an alley.

653
00:39:32.741 --> 00:39:34.150
He's about to turn into superman.

654
00:39:34.151 --> 00:39:39.151
He pulls his shirt open to reveal the es and literally mid-stride his hair goes

655
00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:44.890
and turns from the hood to the left.

656
00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:50.080
So you're saying that sophisticated popular cultural motion picture

657
00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:50.920
manufacturers,

658
00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:55.510
at least two presidents have been persuaded to this position at this very moment

659
00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:58.550
on a Saturday night. That is what I'm saying. All right,

660
00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:03.610
well for argument's sake that, what would you say, I hate to get into this,

661
00:40:03.611 --> 00:40:08.611
any paper explains the difference between putting the power of your hair on the

662
00:40:08.651 --> 00:40:11.290
left hand or the right hand. Well, if you ask John,

663
00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:16.320
what he'll say is that the left hair part emphasizes strength and logic because

664
00:40:16.421 --> 00:40:19.100
it draws your attention to the logical,

665
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:21.880
more masculine side of your face, your brain.

666
00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:25.090
Cause it's a left brain kind of thing. But I don't really know.

667
00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:28.810
So I decided I would actually take this seriously and figure out how to feel

668
00:40:28.811 --> 00:40:33.160
about it. So I call up this guy. His name is Mike Nichols. Oh,

669
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:34.560
from graduate. There's the mic.

670
00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:39.400
A very good a psychology professor in Australia is an expert in symmetry that

671
00:40:39.401 --> 00:40:42.490
Mike Nichols, I ran him through John's theory.

672
00:40:42.491 --> 00:40:45.550
Have you ever seen the superman movies? Some of the earlier ones. I think,

673
00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:50.110
you know how Clark Kent's hair as part of the right ran through the whole thing,

674
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:52.840
you know, Clark's on the rain, maybe he's weeks you've met lab,

675
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:57.610
maybe you stronger, more assertive. Is there anything to that?

676
00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:02.020
Anything at all? Um, yeah, I mean possibly, you know,

677
00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:08.750
um, uh, but,

678
00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:14.470
but, but he didn't say this, which is interesting in focusing on the left,

679
00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:20.520
John Maybe picking up on a particular bias that we human beings have to our left

680
00:41:20.831 --> 00:41:23.980
side. For instance, here's an experiment that uh,

681
00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:27.460
he and his colleagues did like a snapshot of someone's face, um,

682
00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:32.260
at baseline when they're showing no emotion blank face and then get them to try

683
00:41:32.261 --> 00:41:35.210
to look as happy or sad as I could take happy guy.

684
00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:39.560
And overlay him onto no expression guy and almost like a contour map.

685
00:41:39.561 --> 00:41:41.930
You could actually look at the amount of change,

686
00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.180
the amount of muscle movement and that it occurred,

687
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:47.390
which you will see if you measure the muscle movement in millimeters on each

688
00:41:47.391 --> 00:41:47.871
side of the face.

689
00:41:47.871 --> 00:41:52.871
You'll see that the smile curves a few extra millimeters on the left side of the

690
00:41:53.061 --> 00:41:57.200
face. He says this is nearly always the case. Always on the left side.

691
00:41:57.201 --> 00:42:00.440
What it's really telling you is that when somebody smiles or when they frown or

692
00:42:00.441 --> 00:42:01.100
whatever,

693
00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:04.280
they're doing it slightly more strongly on the left side of their face.

694
00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:07.790
Now if this is the case that our left side is sort of saying more emotionally

695
00:42:07.791 --> 00:42:10.520
than our right side, then if you think about the mirror,

696
00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:14.750
it's kind of a discombobulating thing. You know, cause it's taken your left,

697
00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.810
which is sort of broadcasting emotion, flipping it to your right.

698
00:42:17.811 --> 00:42:20.240
You're seeing yourself, your own mixed up.

699
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:23.150
You don't know which part of you is where you, so you're saying like,

700
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:26.180
because I tend to address you with my attention on your left side,

701
00:42:26.181 --> 00:42:27.200
unbeknownst to me.

702
00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.880
And your left side is actually flipped over to your rights at I don't, I,

703
00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:33.170
it's a where are we? So it's exactly, but John has uh,

704
00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:35.630
has developed a solution to this uh, problem.

705
00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:41.480
Take this one apart now.

706
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:44.630
Makes and sells his own very special mirrors right out of his home.

707
00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:48.800
And is this where you make everything to get goes into the mirror is made here.

708
00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.520
Um, you see here, this is the machine that cuts the mirror.

709
00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:57.440
He buys these giant sheets of reflective glass and he slices them into little

710
00:42:57.441 --> 00:42:58.274
pieces,

711
00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.810
clunk. And then I snap it.

712
00:43:06.850 --> 00:43:08.770
Now for each mirror, uh, this is the key.

713
00:43:08.771 --> 00:43:11.440
He uses two pieces of mirror glass instead of one.

714
00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:15.820
What he'll do is he'll take these two pieces and he'll place them together at a,

715
00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:19.330
at right angles, two mirrors at right angles. Like exactly at right angles.

716
00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:24.160
It has to be a 90.0 degrees. And let's just push this up a little bit.

717
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.700
It's still not enough n****s. When he finally gets it right,

718
00:43:27.701 --> 00:43:31.480
which can take hours. What he'll have is this v shaped Miri. He'll stand it up,

719
00:43:31.481 --> 00:43:33.820
put it in a box, and then Voila.

720
00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:39.060
What you have is a mirror that shows you a mirror image of a mirror image of you

721
00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:42.970
takes the normally flipped guy that you'd see in the mirror,

722
00:43:43.330 --> 00:43:47.620
re flips him so that what you are seeing is essentially, well,

723
00:43:47.621 --> 00:43:51.400
for the first time in a mirror you see yourself as other people see you. Okay,

724
00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:54.550
so there you go. So what is this that you have in your head? This is,

725
00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:58.690
this is a true mirror. This is that to the 12 inch model. And so when you like,

726
00:43:58.691 --> 00:44:02.790
this is actually what I look like at touch. You're right. I see.

727
00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.990
It's actually on the right side. Oh my God. Isn't that crazy? That's crazy.

728
00:44:07.610 --> 00:44:10.270
It is surprisingly weird to see yourself this way.

729
00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.450
I feel like my nose is going the wrong way. Yeah.

730
00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:18.370
I never knew my nose went that way and this little flare in my eyebrows is on

731
00:44:18.371 --> 00:44:21.940
the wrong side or the right side as it were.

732
00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:26.140
John claims that many a fair number. I probably would put you in this bunch.

733
00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:28.420
My cohost, when they stand in front of this mirror,

734
00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:32.070
they a freak out many of them because they, it's

735
00:44:32.090 --> 00:44:35.250
<v 7>just their perception is this shaken up a little bit. In fact,</v>

736
00:44:35.251 --> 00:44:39.180
he sometimes takes his mirrors to these festivals and who will sort of set them

737
00:44:39.181 --> 00:44:42.270
up and have people look at themselves and then fill out comment cards

738
00:44:42.271 --> 00:44:44.760
afterwards. You know what I mean? If you look at some of the comments, you know,

739
00:44:44.761 --> 00:44:47.280
it's like they're monster.

740
00:44:47.980 --> 00:44:48.813
<v 15>I am</v>

741
00:44:49.530 --> 00:44:54.480
<v 7>monster anymore here. What did he say? I am a,</v>

742
00:44:54.481 --> 00:44:54.760
I am

743
00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:55.593
<v 15>may</v>

756
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:51.220
<v 0>okay. Hey, I'm jet. I boom, rod.</v>

757
00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:55.320
I remembered Krulwich this is radio lab and today you're still desperately

758
00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:59.980
looking, seeking symmetry as you say. Oh, not well yet. We have looked at love,

759
00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:03.900
failed, looked at brain veiled, look at mirrors, chemistry of life.

760
00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:06.940
So we thought, well for the last stop on this trip,

761
00:46:06.941 --> 00:46:10.960
if we were to go anywhere to find or look for deep unity,

762
00:46:10.961 --> 00:46:15.300
a deep oneness and symmetry. Maybe the beginning. Yeah, of everything. Zero.

763
00:46:15.460 --> 00:46:18.400
So we found ourselves a physicist. Again, it's Neil degrasse Tyson.

764
00:46:18.401 --> 00:46:21.940
I began with a very, very basic question.

765
00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:27.120
If you look at me and I look at you and you seem to be made of stuff and I seem

766
00:46:27.251 --> 00:46:30.550
to be made of stuff and here we are and here our tables and chairs.

767
00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:35.640
Is it surprised you in some deep way that we are all here made of stuff?

768
00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:41.230
Yes. It's, it's not so much surprise. Understates it, it's shocking.

769
00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:44.800
Really. It's shocking, Huh? What is,

770
00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:48.700
what is shocking that there's any matter in the universe at all?

771
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:52.810
Meaning that this conversation shouldn't be happening no deeper the mouth.

772
00:46:53.970 --> 00:46:57.160
It's deeper than just whether or not we'd be having this conversation.

773
00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:02.980
It's whether or not any of this would exist. Earth, the galaxy and the like.

774
00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:06.120
<v 4>Whew.</v>

775
00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:10.620
<v 7>Okay. So, um, if you go back 13.7 billion years ago,</v>

776
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:13.350
that's my shallow Glaser again, the physicist and he says,

777
00:47:13.351 --> 00:47:17.460
if you rolled back the history, the universe, no more stars,

778
00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:21.180
no molecules, no atoms can play the movie backwards. Now,

779
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:24.720
all the weeks to the beginning, just after you know,

780
00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:30.460
the Big Bang, you have what we call a primeval

781
00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:35.680
<v 2>soup. This soup was actually was made of light,</v>

782
00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:40.600
universe of light, very high energy and out of this energy, this heat,

783
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.650
this interactions, you suddenly get [inaudible].

784
00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:50.080
<v 7>What this tells us is that these are belches Jad,</v>

785
00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:54.760
belches noches of matter. The light is doing this. Yes.

786
00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:57.200
This is the what equals mc squared is all about,

787
00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:00.080
because energy is just a form of matter. And vice versa.

788
00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:03.740
I feel like I should know what you're talking about, but I don't. Okay, let's,

789
00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:07.220
let's start. Let's start a little simpler. There's light all around us.

790
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:10.790
We're in a studio. It's visible light. So this light

791
00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:17.510
has no mass, has energy. Even o m [inaudible] crank up the energy of the light,

792
00:48:17.511 --> 00:48:21.150
go to ultra violet x-rays,

793
00:48:21.830 --> 00:48:26.610
and there's a point in x-rays where you have a high enough x-ray photon,

794
00:48:27.180 --> 00:48:28.560
it will spontaneously

795
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:31.230
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

796
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:33.330
<v 7>turn into a particle. Electrons. In fact. Oh,</v>

797
00:48:33.470 --> 00:48:36.900
so you're saying if you crank up the e the energy at the light high enough,

798
00:48:36.901 --> 00:48:40.470
it'll suddenly just turn into mass. That's correct. So just picture the soup.

799
00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:41.350
<v 2>Well,</v>

800
00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:46.350
really intensely hot and it's belching out to do.

801
00:48:46.530 --> 00:48:49.490
I left trons Zumi around. Oh, Tom Parks.

802
00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:53.700
Each man neutrinos continuously churning,

803
00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:57.780
churning, churning. Over time,

804
00:48:57.840 --> 00:49:01.260
all that matter clumps together in more and more complex forms until you finally

805
00:49:01.261 --> 00:49:02.094
get

806
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:03.390
<v 1>us.</v>

807
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:08.190
<v 7>Sounds really simple, doesn't it? Chat? Yes, but there's a, but coming.</v>

808
00:49:08.191 --> 00:49:10.440
I can smell it, but, and here's the big butts.

809
00:49:10.520 --> 00:49:14.790
Knew it back in 1928 1929 there was this physicist,

810
00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:16.890
young guy, Paul Dirac,

811
00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:20.160
he's doing some math and he's thinking about this whole business of turning

812
00:49:20.161 --> 00:49:24.330
light into matter. Okay? Now he's puzzled by something. What?

813
00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:27.840
There is a law in physics called the law of conservation of charge,

814
00:49:27.841 --> 00:49:31.920
which simply means this. It rolls off your tongue quite nicely, doesn't it?

815
00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:35.760
It does. So here's what it means. Whenever you create something,

816
00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.990
if it in the beginning you have zero electric charge at the end you have to have

817
00:49:39.991 --> 00:49:43.920
zero electric charge to that is you cannot create electric charge.

818
00:49:43.921 --> 00:49:45.150
You have to keep the balance.

819
00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:50.180
If you make something in the universe that has a positive charge or a net,

820
00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:54.000
like make an electron, okay, just make one right now. Yeah,

821
00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:59.650
<v 2>gone. That Electron has eight you remember,</v>

822
00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:01.030
remember this from eighth grade eight

823
00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:03.570
<v 7>negative one baby, make two electrons.</v>

824
00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.590
Now make three electrons negative three.

825
00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:11.040
Now if the university is to stay in balance,

826
00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.250
you need to have something that has a positive charge.

827
00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:16.350
You got three minuses on one side.

828
00:50:16.630 --> 00:50:19.050
You have nothing on the other side in a second. If this is true,

829
00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:20.820
how would you even make an electron?

830
00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:24.750
The sheer fact of creating an electron puts it out of balance. Well, here's,

831
00:50:24.751 --> 00:50:28.190
here's the metal story. Here's Ron. Well, no, Paul that. Well, how about this?

832
00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:30.440
What if every time you created an electron,

833
00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:33.500
you created an entire electron?

834
00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:39.700
What every particle could have an equal but opposite in tight particle that is a

835
00:50:39.771 --> 00:50:41.720
particle that looks very much the same,

836
00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:45.770
but essentially it's electric charge is reversed. It would look the same,

837
00:50:45.771 --> 00:50:46.820
like really look, yes,

838
00:50:46.821 --> 00:50:49.580
you'd have to measure their properties to know that they were different.

839
00:50:49.610 --> 00:50:52.340
Is it a mirror image or am I think of it as a mirror image?

840
00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:55.580
There's a thing called quantum spin and it would just be spinning the opposite

841
00:50:55.581 --> 00:50:59.540
way, but charges the most obvious difference. For example,

842
00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:03.800
the anti-matter cousin of the electron because the electron is a negative

843
00:51:03.801 --> 00:51:07.550
charge. This little guy should have a positive charge. Exactly,

844
00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:11.720
but in every other way it would be the same. Right, and no one ever seen one.

845
00:51:11.721 --> 00:51:14.860
He just thought that there probably would be one. Yes.

846
00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.920
And why did he think this? Math. Math.

847
00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:20.230
It was a solution to these equations.

848
00:51:20.290 --> 00:51:23.280
And that's the beauty of theoretical physics. I solve your equations.

849
00:51:23.350 --> 00:51:27.700
You can sometimes find out about the world. And then yes, a few years later,

850
00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:30.540
quite a bit, they found the positron,

851
00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:34.800
the anti-matter version of the electron. Oh yeah, no, it's deep in steam.

852
00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:39.360
How did they do that? Like see it? Well, particles, um, you know,

853
00:51:39.361 --> 00:51:43.680
they're very tiny, right? You can't really see them. So all you do is, uh, you,

854
00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:46.290
you create little systems in the laboratory.

855
00:51:46.350 --> 00:51:49.410
You get like a vapor and you put the vapor in a tank, he says,

856
00:51:49.411 --> 00:51:53.100
and when the electron or the Anti Electron shoots through the vapor,

857
00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:57.420
the particle destabilizes the vapor and makes little bubbles. Okay.

858
00:51:57.930 --> 00:52:02.770
You can see these little bubbles appearing out of nothing. Ah, seriously.

859
00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:07.020
An amazing thing. So you can't see the particle itself,

860
00:52:07.021 --> 00:52:11.160
but you can see its shadow. It's road trip. It's road trip. Yeah.

861
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:12.060
So then he says, okay,

862
00:52:12.061 --> 00:52:15.810
imagine you get this little piece of light and heat it up really hot so that it

863
00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:21.540
spawns, or as we've learned, not one particle but two matter anti-matter pair,

864
00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:25.380
put them in the uh, vapor tank and you put a magnet in there.

865
00:52:25.530 --> 00:52:29.520
You can tell if it's going to the left or to the right if it's a positive or

866
00:52:29.521 --> 00:52:34.230
negative charge. It is cool.

867
00:52:34.290 --> 00:52:37.860
You see two particle tracks that each curl opposite directions and if they have

868
00:52:37.861 --> 00:52:41.310
the same rate of curl, that means they have the same mass.

869
00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:46.860
So if we go back to our picture of the early universe that the soup which,

870
00:52:46.861 --> 00:52:48.540
and you named all of those particles,

871
00:52:48.541 --> 00:52:51.810
does that mean that for every particle that you named there is its opposite

872
00:52:51.811 --> 00:52:55.940
floating around there as well. Exactly. You have electrons, anti electronics.

873
00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:57.090
We try to answer a neutron and

874
00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:01.200
Proton Antiproton this is all very beautiful and you'd say, great,

875
00:53:01.201 --> 00:53:03.390
I have a very democratic universe, you know,

876
00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:06.420
has many particles and antiparticles and everybody's happy.

877
00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:11.360
All your problem is the following. When an alarm electron and a positron meet,

878
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:13.640
they will find each other and oh,

879
00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:17.240
and they will annihilate you.

880
00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:20.690
Even they'll find something because they'll find their original other hand. No,

881
00:53:20.691 --> 00:53:23.390
no. They wouldn't need to know. Just find another kind like that's correct.

882
00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:27.360
That's correct. So Chad, now imagine that we're in the very early universe.

883
00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:31.920
I am a teeny bit of matter. And you opposite, I'm an anti cro,

884
00:53:31.921 --> 00:53:32.760
which an anti code.

885
00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:36.420
And so the procrit which is sitting here and I see you across the,

886
00:53:36.421 --> 00:53:39.000
he's now I'm positive. Charge your name,

887
00:53:39.001 --> 00:53:42.170
we charge the charges track year round.

888
00:53:47.410 --> 00:53:50.260
You see it doesn't work out too well for us. But you know, he, wait, wait,

889
00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:55.380
this is actually a rather profound puzzle because if Paul Dirac was right and

890
00:53:56.111 --> 00:53:59.860
half the universe is matter, the other half of the universe is Andy mattered.

891
00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:02.650
And we all bumped into each other as we just did.

892
00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:07.360
Well eventually I guess we would just not, we would just become,

893
00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:12.550
I don't what, Oh, I don't know. We would not be here.

894
00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:16.170
Dan just blink out and there'd be nothing. Exactly.

895
00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:18.963
Really nothing.

896
00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:25.480
So it's a field of mostly not mostly just

897
00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:30.920
<v 17>radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation,</v>

898
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:36.190
radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation, radiation,

899
00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:39.230
radiation, radiation, radiation.

900
00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:43.033
[inaudible].

901
00:54:59.520 --> 00:54:59.761
<v 7>Well,</v>

902
00:54:59.761 --> 00:55:02.970
there's something wrong with this theory because we are talking to each other.

903
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:07.830
Yeah. So something, something's wrong with this notion. Yes.

904
00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:12.980
And what's wrong is that imperfection in the laws of physics that we know of now

905
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:18.000
and that, uh, is responsible for this bias. What, which means what day was that?

906
00:55:18.001 --> 00:55:21.330
There was a little more of of matter, but we call matter than,

907
00:55:21.331 --> 00:55:23.340
than anti matter or, yes.

908
00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:28.370
There was to be precise to every billion particles of anti-matter.

909
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:33.630
We had 1,000,000,001 ah, particles of matter. Oh my God.

910
00:55:33.631 --> 00:55:35.790
Really? Yes. Oh, that's tiny.

911
00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:41.200
Excess of one in a billion is enough to create everything that exists now.

912
00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:42.420
Lonely little guy.

913
00:55:44.320 --> 00:55:46.600
We would call that an asymmetry.

914
00:55:54.540 --> 00:55:54.690
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

915
00:55:54.690 --> 00:55:58.110
<v 7>so everything we see in the universe, all the stars,</v>

916
00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:01.410
all the suns and the moons and the graft and the mountains and us,

917
00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:05.250
although we're the left, we're the extra stuff. Yes,

918
00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:10.400
we are the result of this asymmetry.

919
00:56:10.850 --> 00:56:14.150
Has Anybody dealt with the real question that's provoked here? It's like,

920
00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:18.680
why was there more of one stuff kind of stuff. Then the other kind of stuff.

921
00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:21.560
So there you go. That is one beautiful question,

922
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:24.100
but we don't have any on any

923
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:27.840
<v 0>final answer yet. You don't know because you see,</v>

924
00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:31.270
you don't all know. We do not know. That's right. Which is okay.

925
00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:34.630
Not knowing is a wonderful thing in science, otherwise it could just retire.

926
00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:41.210
Can I tell you my favorite lawyer joke told to me by a lawyer? Yeah.

927
00:56:41.290 --> 00:56:43.420
I have to spread this cause it's the best one.

928
00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:46.960
98% of lawyers give the other 2% of bad names.

929
00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:55.480
Well that's the go music and go music meaning go away.

930
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:58.780
Or here's a different place to go to our website,

931
00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:02.980
radiolab.org where you can read more about anything you heard in this era.

932
00:57:02.981 --> 00:57:07.480
You can see those amazing Lincoln picks and other things we've got there on

933
00:57:07.481 --> 00:57:10.900
symmetry. And of course you can subscribe to our podcast,

934
00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:13.570
which we usually get to hear the show. You know, whenever you like,
