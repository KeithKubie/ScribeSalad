00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.730
&gt;&gt; Aright. I'm really, I'm really in to this

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.600
dashboard thing. We've got our, our nice pretty visualized data.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.620
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.400
&gt;&gt; I suspect that there is a way in Sales Force to,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.170
kind of, get this functionality, you know, filtering data, things like

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.200
that, but in the app itself. And, like. I could imagine

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.530
maybe, there's someone at the festival whose, whose job is to organize

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.970
the electronic music bands, or the Bossanova bands for you, and that,

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.350
that person might want to just look at bands of a specific genre.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.980
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.620
&gt;&gt; Is there a way to filter data like that.

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.020
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, that's actually a pretty easy functionality to create.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.120
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.650
&gt;&gt; let's take a look here. So what we're

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.600
looking at right now is a List View of

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.490
just the recent bands. That's what comes up by

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.530
default. And if you click that Go button, it's going to

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.030
take us to the All list view. So

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.660
that's showing us all the bands completely. But like

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.230
you saw from that little pick list, the only

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.190
option we have is All. So, in order to

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.130
create a view to sort by genre, we have

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.349
to create a new view. So click that Create

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.800
New View Link. And so this is going to create

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.980
a list view of any filter that we define.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.750
&gt;&gt; Actually going to do it Bossanova bands.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.750
&gt;&gt;

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.510
[LAUGH]

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.944
That's a small list.

00:01:15.944 --> 00:01:20.060
&gt;&gt; It is a small list. Select a banner. All bands.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.029
&gt;&gt; You want All Bands and then we want to choose a genre field. And

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:27.730
then equals whatever, and so you could make

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.942
these pretty complicated with filters on like dates

00:01:30.942 --> 00:01:35.860
and this date but also this name and this genre and get really specific. Like

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.210
if we have multiple festivals, it could even

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.440
be genres but only at a certain festival.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.440
&gt;&gt;

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.610
Mhm. Okay. And so I'm going to, let's see I'm going to

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.800
show the band name and I'm going to show the manager

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.850
phone number and maybe I want to know their Twitter handle

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.120
so I can Tweet them in all my PR stuff.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.510
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.060
&gt;&gt; And I'll make it visible to all users.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.390
&gt;&gt; Sounds good.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.780
&gt;&gt; Hit Save. Anyway, with this set, there are only three Bossanova bands, so,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.120
this manager does not have a lot of work to do, but that's okay.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.120
&gt;&gt;

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.290
[LAUGH]

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.730
So I really like where we're going with

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.470
this. You know, we can really visualize our data

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.020
and get a feel of what it would be like to use the app on the day of.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I want to think more about

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.970
that because, I mean, having this visualization is nice.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:19.450
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.920
&gt;&gt; But it's actually, it's not that clear to me what

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.530
I would actually be doing on the actual day of the festival.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.430
&gt;&gt; Right. And you know, we haven't completely added functionality

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.900
into it yet, even. Right now it's just static data and

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.680
it's showing us information, but it's a little bit of calculation

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.990
based off the formulas that we've made, but we haven't added

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.180
too much human interaction pieces to it, you know, that actually.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.590
&gt;&gt; Streamline processes.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.090
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, can we do that?

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do that.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.180
&gt;&gt; Cool.
