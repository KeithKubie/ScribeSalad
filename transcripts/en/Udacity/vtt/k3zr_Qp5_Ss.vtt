00:00:00.601 --> 00:00:03.384
I'm happy to announce my new course on Applied Cryptography!

00:00:03.384 --> 00:00:09.751
Cryptography means secret writing-- it goes back to the earliest human desires to keep and share secrets

00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:13.967
In the early days, cryptography was only available to generals and emperors

00:00:13.967 --> 00:00:16.868
but today, it is used by nearly everyone, everyday.

00:00:16.868 --> 00:00:19.117
Every time you do a credit card transaction,

00:00:19.117 --> 00:00:23.354
make a phone call, use a secure website, you're using cryptography.

00:00:23.354 --> 00:00:28.020
In this class we'll start by learning the mathematical foundations behind cryptography.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.002
Then we'll see how to use cryptography to solve problems in computing.

00:00:32.002 --> 00:00:35.526
We'll see how to use cryptography to manage passwords, and user accounts.

00:00:35.526 --> 00:00:40.008
To do secure transactions, to make money from nothing but numbers

00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:43.110
and to do computation while keeping your data private.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.309
Cryptography is a really fun topic! It's all about making, and breaking puzzles.

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.193
I hope we'll see you in class.
