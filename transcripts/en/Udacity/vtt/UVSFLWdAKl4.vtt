00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.520
So let's move a bit to progress a little
more programming at the question so

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.943
I do want to start you
off with a SQL question.

00:00:07.943 --> 00:00:08.480
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.070
&gt;&gt; Let's say we have this table and
maybe I should writer and

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.640
if you want to write it,
but here feel free to.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.170
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Let's say you have a table and

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.260
list it was called cards right and this
table is going to have several rows.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.300
The first one is going to be an i.d.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.170
Which is just an integer.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.509
The second one is going to be
a make of the other vehicle.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.490
Where you can be a character.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.010
Ok.
Or

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.020
a set of characters right so
the next one to be the model.

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.578
Of the vehicle.

00:00:42.578 --> 00:00:44.698
Character as well.

00:00:44.698 --> 00:00:48.050
&gt;&gt; Do you mean like a stream?

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.623
&gt;&gt; I think okay yeah string.

00:00:49.623 --> 00:00:50.338
Yeah.

00:00:50.338 --> 00:00:51.297
&gt;&gt; Okay so.

00:00:51.297 --> 00:00:54.320
Okay I'll remember [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; And

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.130
the next phase will be how many
cylinders this is ripple have?

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.180
Preferably is an Integer.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.020
And lastly the horse power.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.968
Of the car is also an integer.

00:01:13.848 --> 00:01:18.747
So, okay, so what I would like you to
do is, to write a simple query that

00:01:18.747 --> 00:01:23.650
will give me the three vehicles with
the highest number of horsepower,

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.610
that have more than
six cylinders in them.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.180
Okay, let me, say that again so
that I can write it down.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.600
The three.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.010
&gt;&gt; The three vehicles.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.840
&gt;&gt; Vehicles.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.370
&gt;&gt; That have the highest horsepower.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.810
&gt;&gt; Highest horsepower.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.520
Okay.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.191
&gt;&gt; But at least six cylinders.

00:01:49.257 --> 00:01:58.084
&gt;&gt; Okay Okay.

00:01:58.084 --> 00:02:03.540
So I'm assuming that in
my table I could have

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.460
I guess what I'm wondering is,
are we talking about vehicles,

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.100
as in, with separate id?

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.830
Or are we thinking about types
of vehicle, like make and model.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.120
Could there be more than one
car with the same make and

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.300
model, and presumably, the same
number of cylinders and horsepower?

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.858
&gt;&gt; No, no, so this would be different.

00:02:26.858 --> 00:02:28.710
Yeah
&gt;&gt; Okay, Okay.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.935
&gt;&gt; This is just information
about to make a model.

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:39.471
&gt;&gt; .Okay Okay so like this would be
specified by like make model here.

00:02:39.471 --> 00:02:41.268
&gt;&gt; Yes exactly.

00:02:41.268 --> 00:02:42.783
&gt;&gt; Okay cool.

00:02:42.783 --> 00:02:45.550
Right okay so.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.777
This I need to write out the query but
I'm trying to think of the best order so

00:02:52.777 --> 00:02:57.939
let me think through what I
need to do so this three will

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:04.177
be a limit three that will probably
be the last thing in my query.

00:03:04.177 --> 00:03:07.176
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; I'll be selecting make and

00:03:07.176 --> 00:03:12.592
model from cars where there
are like number of cylinders is

00:03:12.592 --> 00:03:18.570
greater than or equal to six and
order by i horsepower.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:22.620
And I guess I'll need to figure out,
it'll have to be desk descending.

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.510
Okay.
&gt;&gt; So.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.892
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Now I need to put that all together.

00:03:26.892 --> 00:03:28.470
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Yeah, that sounds perfect.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.709
&gt;&gt; Okay, so select.

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:52.827
Make model

00:03:52.827 --> 00:03:55.968
from

00:03:55.968 --> 00:04:03.039
cars where

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:14.455
Number of cylinders is greater than or

00:04:14.455 --> 00:04:21.699
equal to six and
then I'm going to order.

00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:28.551
By horsepower

00:04:34.432 --> 00:04:37.585
Descending.

00:04:37.585 --> 00:04:44.310
And then limit three, semi-colon.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.188
I've run into that problem before.

00:04:46.188 --> 00:04:51.220
[LAUGH] So
I think that probably does it.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.070
&gt;&gt; So return a table,
make model from course.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:59.070
All right there's six cylinders,
order by the horsepower we want,

00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.990
the high is three, limit three.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.160
Yeah.
So that's excellent.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.970
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Great.
