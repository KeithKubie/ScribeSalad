[Norvig] So here we have a test for 1 player, and I've chosen the straight flush.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I could have chosen anything.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I say when the straight flush plays solitaire, it wins.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Here I've chosen a list with 1 straight flush and 99 full houses,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and I say when 99 full houses play a straight flush, the straight flush wins.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You may not know this notation, these types of operators in Python.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We can take a list and multiply it by a number, and that just says

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
repeat that list that many times.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So 99 times a 1 element list is a 99 element list all with the same element,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and then we can add 2 lists together, and that just says concatenate them.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So this 1 element joins in with these 99 elements to make a 100 element list.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This is far from a complete test suite.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We would really want much more complete coverage of tests.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Poker, we have 9 different rankings of the hands.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We would want to have at least 1 for each of those,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
so there would have to be at least 9 tests and probably many more tests than that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
before we had real confidence that we got it right,

00:01:10.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but at least we got a start and we have some simple sanity tests within our test suite.
