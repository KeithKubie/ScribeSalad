to see the separation of why he needs to

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:42.740
to see the separation of why he needs to
 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.620
to see the separation of why he needs to
be spider-man not only because he has

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630
be spider-man not only because he has
 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.140
be spider-man not only because he has
this responsibility but because from a

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150
this responsibility but because from a
 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.090
this responsibility but because from a
selfish standpoint he needs to be

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100
selfish standpoint he needs to be
 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.520
selfish standpoint he needs to be
spider-man to actually be someone yeah I

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530
spider-man to actually be someone yeah I
 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.410
spider-man to actually be someone yeah I
think we see that on the third movie in

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420
think we see that on the third movie in
 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.120
think we see that on the third movie in
spider-man 3 we see that he kind of

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130
spider-man 3 we see that he kind of
 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.380
spider-man 3 we see that he kind of
needs spider-man few because people

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390
needs spider-man few because people
 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.090
needs spider-man few because people
start to like him yeah so he kind of

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100
start to like him yeah so he kind of
 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.950
start to like him yeah so he kind of
lets that you know get in his head and

00:02:59.950 --> 00:02:59.960
lets that you know get in his head and
 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.690
lets that you know get in his head and
he kind of becomes a little cocky mm-hmm

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700
he kind of becomes a little cocky mm-hmm
 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.430
he kind of becomes a little cocky mm-hmm
which is kind of one of the reasons why

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440
which is kind of one of the reasons why
 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.690
which is kind of one of the reasons why
I don't like that because I don't think

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700
I don't like that because I don't think
 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:07.240
I don't like that because I don't think
Peter really lets things get to his head

well we kind of see the importance of
 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.610
well we kind of see the importance of
being able to have to well not being

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620
being able to have to well not being
 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.970
being able to have to well not being
able to of having to give up the idea of

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980
able to of having to give up the idea of
 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.730
able to of having to give up the idea of
a normal life in order to be spider-man

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740
a normal life in order to be spider-man
 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.620
a normal life in order to be spider-man

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380
have the choice but there is almost a
 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.130

selfish bit to it that he pulls from as

and a tall crown did not know me and I
 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.790
and a tall crown did not know me and I
that's not like it I think that's a

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800
that's not like it I think that's a
 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.130
that's not like it I think that's a
stereotype I don't think that exists all

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:22.140
stereotype I don't think that exists all
 

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:23.720
stereotype I don't think that exists all
that much in the real world and I think

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:23.730
that much in the real world and I think
 

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:25.550
that much in the real world and I think
that McGuire in the first movie kind of

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560
that McGuire in the first movie kind of
 

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.930
that McGuire in the first movie kind of
played that pretty well but as those

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940
played that pretty well but as those
 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:28.930
played that pretty well but as those
moves went on they tried to make him

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:28.940
moves went on they tried to make him
 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.640
moves went on they tried to make him
weirder yeah and the difference between

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:31.650
weirder yeah and the difference between
 

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:32.990
weirder yeah and the difference between
him and spider-man was greater and

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000
him and spider-man was greater and
 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.940
him and spider-man was greater and
greater I into the trope right I think

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:34.950
greater I into the trope right I think
 

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.590
greater I into the trope right I think
yeah I think with Maguire when he was

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:36.600
yeah I think with Maguire when he was
 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.930
yeah I think with Maguire when he was
outside the the mask he was the certain

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:38.940
outside the the mask he was the certain
 

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.430
outside the the mask he was the certain
character and then was in the mask like

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:40.440
character and then was in the mask like
 

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.900
character and then was in the mask like
if there was no connection whatsoever

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:41.910
if there was no connection whatsoever
 

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.750
if there was no connection whatsoever
and yeah I thought that was a weakness

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:44.760
and yeah I thought that was a weakness
 

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.700
and yeah I thought that was a weakness
in his performance where Garfield I mean

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:46.710
in his performance where Garfield I mean
 

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.320
in his performance where Garfield I mean
he is kind of a smartass as Peter Parker

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:48.330
he is kind of a smartass as Peter Parker
 

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.210
he is kind of a smartass as Peter Parker
so when he was a jerk he's kind of a

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:50.220
so when he was a jerk he's kind of a
 

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.130
so when he was a jerk he's kind of a
jerk what a great view first gets his

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:52.140
jerk what a great view first gets his
 

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.500
jerk what a great view first gets his

mean like because I mean you only can
take so much of that stuff before he's a

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:02.820
take so much of that stuff before he's a
 

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.580
take so much of that stuff before he's a
kid isn't ending up for people before he

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:04.590
kid isn't ending up for people before he
 

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.010

hunting down Uncle Ben's killer which is

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:08.580
hunting down Uncle Ben's killer which is
 

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:10.160
hunting down Uncle Ben's killer which is
like a more of a personal video about

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:10.170
like a more of a personal video about
 

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:13.130
like a more of a personal video about
like a revenge thing yeah exactly

00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:13.140
like a revenge thing yeah exactly
 

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.400
like a revenge thing yeah exactly
exactly

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:14.410
exactly
 

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.170
exactly
so yeah he definitely took some

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:16.180
so yeah he definitely took some
 

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:17.760
so yeah he definitely took some
liberties with the character but he made

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:17.770
liberties with the character but he made
 

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.680
liberties with the character but he made
it his own and I think that's you know

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:19.690
it his own and I think that's you know
 

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.890
it his own and I think that's you know
more than what McGuire did I think that

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:22.900
more than what McGuire did I think that
 

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.439
more than what McGuire did I think that
he tailored it more to his personality

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:25.449
he tailored it more to his personality
 

00:08:25.449 --> 00:08:27.330
he tailored it more to his personality
and I think that shows in his

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:27.340
and I think that shows in his
 

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:28.740
and I think that shows in his
interactions with the other characters

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:28.750
interactions with the other characters
 

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.020
interactions with the other characters
especially with Gwen with Emma Stone who

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:31.030
especially with Gwen with Emma Stone who
 

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:33.810
especially with Gwen with Emma Stone who
might be even better than than a

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:33.820
might be even better than than a
 

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.790
might be even better than than a
Garfield in these movies she's great

00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:35.800
