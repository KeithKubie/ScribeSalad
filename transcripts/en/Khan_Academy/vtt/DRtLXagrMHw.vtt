00:00:00.616 --> 00:00:02.490
What I've done here is
I've copied and pasted

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.760
a bunch of pictures
that signify events

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.180
in our history, when
you think about history

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.290
on a grander scale, that most
of us have some relation to

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.890
or we kind of have heard it
talked about a little bit.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.820
And the whole point
of this is to try

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.880
to understand, or try
to begin to understand,

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.280
how long 13.7 billion years is.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.090
So just to start off,
I have here-- this

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.967
is the best depiction
I could find

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:29.300
where it didn't have copyrights.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.940
This is from NASA--
of the Big Bang.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.890
And I've talked about
it several times.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.140
The Big Bang occurred
13.7 billion years ago.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.950
And then if we go a
little bit forward,

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.040
actually a lot forward,
we get to the formation

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.950
of our actual solar
system and the Earth.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.050
This is kind of the
protoplanetary disk

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.790
or a depiction of a
protoplanetary disk forming

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.460
around our young Sun.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.006
And so this right here
is 4.5 billion years ago.

00:00:58.006 --> 00:01:00.630
Now this over here-- once again,
these aren't pictures of them.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.713
These are just depictions
because no one was there

00:01:02.713 --> 00:01:03.650
with a camera.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.440
This is what we think
the asteroid that

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.890
killed the dinosaurs looked like
when it was impacting Earth.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.110
And it killed the dinosaurs
65 million years ago.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.100
So until then, we
had land dinosaurs.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.330
And then this, as far as
the current theories go,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.650
got rid of them.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.590
Now, we'll fast forward
a little bit more.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.520
At about 3 million years ago--
let me do this in a color

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.590
that you can see--
about 3 million,

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:43.100
so three million years ago,
our ancestors look like this.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.956
This is Australopithecus
afarensis.

00:01:45.956 --> 00:01:48.355
This is I think a depiction
of-- this is Lucy.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.210
I believe the theory is that all
of us have some DNA from her.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.402
But this was 3
million years ago.

00:01:59.402 --> 00:02:01.360
And you fast forward some
more and you actually

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.100
have the first modern humans
appearing on the planet, people

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.450
that looked and thought
like you and me.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.790
This is 200,000 years ago.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.000
That's right over here.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.320
Obviously, this drawing
was done much later.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.650
But this is a depiction of
a modern human, so 200,000

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.820
years ago.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.651
And then you fast
forward even more.

00:02:22.651 --> 00:02:24.400
And I don't want to
keep picking on Jesus.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.460
I did that with him
getting on the jet liner.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.320
And I genuinely don't mean
any offense to anyone.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.930
I just keep picking Jesus
because frankly our calendar is

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.680
kind of-- he's a good person
that most people know about,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.860
2,000 years ago.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.390
And so when we
associate kind of a lot

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.450
of modern history
occurring after his birth.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.890
So this right here is
obviously a painting

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.220
of the birth of Jesus.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.250
And this is 2,000 years ago.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.950
And then this might be a
little bit American-centric.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.960
But the Declaration
of Independence, it

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.790
was a major event.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.570
Actually even on
a worldwide basis,

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.780
it was the first
secular democracy

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.490
based on a kind of a
constitutional democracy that

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.050
showed up on the planet.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.460
They said we don't want the
king of England anymore.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.170
And this was about
234 years ago.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.680
And I always remembered
because I was born almost

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.010
on the 200th anniversary.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.760
So you just have to
add my age to 200.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.690
So this is 234 years ago.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.550
So these are all events
or periods of time

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.470
that we've heard about
and we've talked about.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.950
And people throw around
these type of years.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.680
But what I want to
do in this video

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.140
is relate it to time scales
that we can comprehend.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.660
So instead of the Big Bang
occurring 13.7 billion years

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.080
ago, let's pretend like
it occurred 10 years ago.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.810
Because most of us, especially
if you're over the age of 10,

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.780
can kind of understand
what 10 years is.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.000
It's a very, very
long period of time.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.190
But something that's well
within our lifetimes,

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.560
well within our experience.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.980
So let's say the 13.7 billion--
instead of saying the Big

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.540
Bang occurred 13.7
billion years ago, let's

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.690
pretend like it
occurred 10 years ago.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.280
And if we pretend that
it occurred 10 years ago,

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.200
let's think about how many
years, or minutes, or hours

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.940
ago each of these events
would have occurred.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.380
So if Big Bang, which is
really 13.7 billion years,

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.890
if it really had
occurred 10 years ago,

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.280
and we scaled everything down,
if we had scaled everything

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.580
down, then the Earth
would have been

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.690
created about 3.3 years ago.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.300
So this would have
been 3.3 years ago.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.960
So there's nothing kind
of amazing about this.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.570
This is a significant fraction
of the age of the universe.

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.430
So not that mind
blowing just yet.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.770
But if we go all the way to
when the dinosaurs were extinct,

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.815
the last land dinosaurs, now
the 65 million years-- and this

00:04:58.815 --> 00:05:01.440
will give you an appreciation of
the difference between million

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.220
and billion-- if the universe
was only 10 years old,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:09.450
then the dinosaurs would have
been extinct 17 days ago.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.211
Not even a month
ago, the dinosaurs

00:05:11.211 --> 00:05:12.210
would have been extinct.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.680
So if the universe was created
when I was just graduated--

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.570
well, I'm in my '30s
now, so when I was 24--

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.510
just last month, the dinosaurs
would have gone extinct.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.620
And it gets even crazier.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.500
17 days ago, the dinosaurs
would have extinct.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.420
Australopithecus
afarensis would have

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.300
walked on the Earth 19
hours ago, yesterday.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.080
19 hours ago, she would
have been walking around

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.900
on the planet.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:48.550
And modern humans wouldn't have
shown up until 80 minutes ago,

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.050
80 minutes, a
little over an hour.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.430
There wasn't even
a modern human.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.550
Then the universe
was 10 years, it

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.280
didn't take until
just very recently,

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.620
the last hour, for us to see
someone that looks something

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.500
like us, looks and
thinks something like us.

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.430
Fast forward even more,
the birth of Jesus,

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.620
if the universe was 10 years
old instead of 13.7 billion--

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.540
and we scaled everything
down-- then the birth of Jesus

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.680
would have been 46 seconds ago.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.250
And then if we fast
forward all the way

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.750
to the Declaration
of Independence,

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:29.850
this would have occurred
five seconds ago.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.900
So this isn't quite
as mind blowing

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:35.850
as the scale of the universe.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.950
But in my mind, this is
still pretty amazing.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:43.450
I mean all that's happened
since 1776 on a global basis

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.570
could have been
encapsulated in five seconds

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.570
if the age of the
universe was 10 years.

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:52.030
So hopefully, that gives you
a little bit of a perspective.

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.180
In the next video, instead
of condensing things in time,

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.740
I'm going to compare this scale
to kind of a distance scale.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.570
So we can kind of say,
hey, if the universe was

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.490
the number of
pixels on my screen,

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.890
how big would each
of these things be?
