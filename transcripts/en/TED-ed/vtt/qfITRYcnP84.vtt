00:00:07.335 --> 00:00:09.329
It's only been the last few hundreds years or so

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:12.088
that Western civilization has been putting art in museums,

00:00:12.088 --> 00:00:13.803
at least museums resembling

00:00:13.803 --> 00:00:17.231
the public institutions we know today.

00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:21.049
Before this, for most, art served other purposes.

00:00:21.049 --> 00:00:23.094
What we call fine art today

00:00:23.094 --> 00:00:25.430
was, in fact, primarily how people experienced

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.223
an aesthetic dimension of religion.

00:00:28.223 --> 00:00:31.810
Paintings, sculpture, textiles and illuminations

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.720
were the media of their time,

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.357
supplying vivid imagery

00:00:35.357 --> 00:00:39.293
to accompany the stories of the day.

00:00:39.293 --> 00:00:41.116
In this sense, Western art

00:00:41.116 --> 00:00:42.862
shared a utilitarian purpose

00:00:42.862 --> 00:00:44.612
with other cultures around the world,

00:00:44.612 --> 00:00:50.048
some of whose languages incidentally have no word for art.

00:00:50.048 --> 00:00:53.379
So how do we define what we call art?

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.167
Generally speaking, what we're talking about here

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:57.112
is work that visually communicates

00:00:57.112 --> 00:00:58.753
meaning beyond language,

00:00:58.753 --> 00:01:00.466
either through representation

00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:03.769
or the arrangement of visual elements in space.

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:06.179
Evidence of this power of iconography,

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:08.613
or ability of images to convey meaning,

00:01:08.613 --> 00:01:10.391
can be found in abundance

00:01:10.391 --> 00:01:11.727
if we look at art from

00:01:11.727 --> 00:01:14.279
the histories of our major world religions.

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:16.814
Almost all have, at one time or another in their history,

00:01:16.814 --> 00:01:19.817
gone through some sort of aniconic phase.

00:01:19.817 --> 00:01:24.584
Aniconism prohibits any visual depiction of the divine.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.991
This is done in order to avoid idolatry,

00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:31.413
or confusion between the representation of divinity and divinity itself.

00:01:31.413 --> 00:01:33.029
Keeping it real, so to speak,

00:01:33.029 --> 00:01:36.917
in the relationship between the individual and the divine.

00:01:36.917 --> 00:01:38.946
However, this can be a challenge to maintain,

00:01:38.946 --> 00:01:41.379
given that the urge to visually represent and interpret

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:42.861
the world around us

00:01:42.861 --> 00:01:45.768
is a compulsion difficult to suppress.

00:01:45.768 --> 00:01:47.802
For example, even today,

00:01:47.802 --> 00:01:50.888
where the depiction of Allah or the Prophet Muhammad is prohibited,

00:01:50.888 --> 00:01:53.268
an abstract celebration of the divine

00:01:53.268 --> 00:01:57.692
can still be found in arabesque patterns of Islamic textile design,

00:01:57.692 --> 00:01:59.563
with masterful flourishes of brushwork

00:01:59.563 --> 00:02:00.843
and Arabic calligraphy,

00:02:00.843 --> 00:02:02.107
where the words of the prophet

00:02:02.107 --> 00:02:05.570
assume a dual role as both literature and visual art.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.114
Likewise, in art from the early periods

00:02:08.114 --> 00:02:10.300
of Christianity and Buddhism,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.245
the divine presence of the Christ and the Buddha

00:02:12.245 --> 00:02:13.913
do not appear in human form

00:02:13.913 --> 00:02:16.113
but are represented by symbols.

00:02:16.113 --> 00:02:17.165
In each case,

00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:19.112
iconographic reference is employed

00:02:19.112 --> 00:02:20.977
as a form of reverence.

00:02:20.977 --> 00:02:23.088
Anthropomorphic representation,

00:02:23.088 --> 00:02:25.090
or depiction in human form,

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.647
eventually became widespread in these religions

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:29.263
only centuries later,

00:02:29.263 --> 00:02:33.638
under the influence of the cultural traditions surrounding them.

00:02:33.638 --> 00:02:34.612
Historically speaking,

00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:36.645
the public appreciation of visual art

00:02:36.645 --> 00:02:39.730
in terms other than traditional, religious or social function

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.564
is a relatively new concept.

00:02:41.564 --> 00:02:45.110
Today, we fetishize the fetish, so to speak.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.197
We go to museums to see art from the ages,

00:02:47.197 --> 00:02:48.862
but our experience of it there

00:02:48.862 --> 00:02:50.529
is drastically removed from the context

00:02:50.529 --> 00:02:53.361
in which it was originally intended to be seen.

00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:55.446
It might be said that the modern viewer

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:57.162
lacks the richness of engagement

00:02:57.162 --> 00:02:58.918
that she has with contemporary art,

00:02:58.918 --> 00:03:01.060
which has been created relevant to her time

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.780
and speaks her cultural language.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.091
It might also be said that the history of what we call art

00:03:06.091 --> 00:03:08.634
is a conversation that continues on,

00:03:08.634 --> 00:03:10.947
as our contemporary present passes into what will be

00:03:10.947 --> 00:03:14.196
some future generation's classical past.

00:03:14.196 --> 00:03:15.807
It's a conversation that reflects

00:03:15.807 --> 00:03:20.104
the ideologies, mythologies, belief systems and taboos

00:03:20.104 --> 00:03:23.294
and so much more of the world in which it was made.

00:03:23.294 --> 00:03:25.715
But this is not to say that work from another age

00:03:25.715 --> 00:03:28.488
made to serve a particular function in that time

00:03:28.488 --> 00:03:31.779
is dead or has nothing to offer the modern viewer.

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:33.612
Even though in a museum setting

00:03:33.612 --> 00:03:35.779
works of art from different places and times

00:03:35.779 --> 00:03:37.529
are presented alongside each other,

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:39.447
isolated from their original settings,

00:03:39.447 --> 00:03:41.749
their juxtaposition has benefits.

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:44.624
Exhibits are organized by curators,

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:45.861
or people who've made a career

00:03:45.861 --> 00:03:48.696
out of their ability to recontextualize or remix

00:03:48.696 --> 00:03:52.676
cultural artifacts in a collective presentation.

00:03:52.676 --> 00:03:55.472
As viewers, we're then able to consider the art

00:03:55.472 --> 00:03:57.774
in terms of a common theme that might not be apparent

00:03:57.774 --> 00:03:59.298
in a particular work

00:03:59.298 --> 00:04:01.529
until you see it alongside another,

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:06.024
and new meanings can be derived and reflected upon.

00:04:06.024 --> 00:04:07.234
If we're so inclined,

00:04:07.234 --> 00:04:09.196
we might even start to see every work of art

00:04:09.196 --> 00:04:12.768
as a complementary part of some undefined, unified whole

00:04:12.768 --> 00:04:14.742
of past human experience,

00:04:14.742 --> 00:04:17.159
a trail that leads right to our doorstep

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:19.270
and continues on with us,

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.582
open to anyone who wants to explore it.
