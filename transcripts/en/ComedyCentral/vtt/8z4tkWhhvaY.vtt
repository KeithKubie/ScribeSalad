00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.780
- Yeah, I feel like it's
like spending quality time

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:02.613
with yourself when you're taking selfies.

00:00:02.613 --> 00:00:04.338
You know, it's therapeutic.
- That's a really nice way

00:00:04.338 --> 00:00:05.171
to look at it.
- Yeah

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:06.470
- I don't think selfies

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.303
are that annoying.
- For me,

00:00:07.303 --> 00:00:08.560
- I kind of like them.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.397
- It's so uncomfortable
- And they're fun!

00:00:09.397 --> 00:00:10.520
- For me, I've tried
- Selfies?

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.390
- I agree, I think it's so weird.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.958
- Milo, people demand
more selfies from you.

00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.150
You gotta just get over your fear.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.618
- I keep trying to take them and post them

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:20.680
because people, you know, want them.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.530
- We want them.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.510
- And then I show my
friends, and is this good?

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.780
And they're like, "That is awful."

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.790
- Don't show your friends.
- That is terrible.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:26.660
- No,
- Don't show your friends.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.899
- I can't just posted it.
- Yeah, you can.

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:28.732
- Milo is the King.

00:00:28.732 --> 00:00:29.820
Go to Milo's Instagram.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.182
All it is, and Andrew Collins, my buddy.

00:00:32.182 --> 00:00:33.015
- Oh, I've been on his Instagram.

00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:35.820
- All it is is him with different girls.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.530
He has, you have more
girlfriends than anyone I know.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.071
- I'm a theater kid, I'm a theater kid.

00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:42.559
There's like two guys in the theater.

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:43.800
- You look like you're
constantly hosting the View.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.633
- Honestly.

00:00:45.551 --> 00:00:47.282
- Like a teenage version of the view.

00:00:47.282 --> 00:00:48.760
There's like four women
of different ethnicities

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.730
around you at a table.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.090
- Yeah, it's become a running joke.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.090
- He's the united colors of Benton nine.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.810
- It's become a running
joke on my Instagram

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.170
that I post, all my friends
are girls, it's just how it is.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.090
So I post with new girls all the time,

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.567
and it's become a joke
that everyone's like,

00:01:02.567 --> 00:01:03.980
"Oh my god, is he dating this person now?"

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.270
And now whenever I post a
photo, I just posted a photo

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.070
of me at a party and in
the back there's a balloon,

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.660
and it's like, "Oh my god,
he's dating the balloon."

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.077
(rock music)

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.191
- From Dancing with the
Stars, the movie Zombies,

00:01:18.191 --> 00:01:21.231
teen sensation, Milo Manheim is here.

00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:23.080
- A teen sensation, that's a stretch.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.873
- Yeah, friend of the show, I mean,

00:01:24.873 --> 00:01:26.400
this is the third appearance.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.233
- I know, I love it here.

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:28.370
- This is old hat for you.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.203
- Yeah, for real.

00:01:29.203 --> 00:01:30.917
I feel like I know
everything about this place.

00:01:30.917 --> 00:01:34.440
- Our other guest, a good friend of yours,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.760
a good friend of mine from
Dancing with the Stars,

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.540
from Instagram, an entrepreneur
in and of her own right,

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.090
just such a strong, cool
woman, Alexis Ren is here.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.923
- Oh, hi.
- Yeah.

00:01:43.923 --> 00:01:45.207
- Hi girl.
- Hi.

00:01:45.207 --> 00:01:47.000
- Thank you for being here.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.040
- Yeah, I actually didn't know

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.730
I was gonna come until you texted me.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.563
- I know.

00:01:50.563 --> 00:01:53.580
Alexis was, everyone's
scrambling at Serious

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.067
being like, "How did you get Alexis Renn?

00:01:55.067 --> 00:01:58.363
"Like can we figure out?
How did you book that bitch?

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.886
It's because you're my friend.

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:01.719
- How did you book that bitch?

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:02.552
- Yeah, they said that.

00:02:02.552 --> 00:02:04.133
That's how they talk
internally at Serious.

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:05.975
- [Andrew] How did you book that bitch?

00:02:05.975 --> 00:02:07.156
(laughs)

00:02:07.156 --> 00:02:08.305
- [Milo] From the president.

00:02:08.305 --> 00:02:09.495
- It's lovingly, yeah.

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:12.575
No, but you're a huge get obviously,

00:02:12.575 --> 00:02:14.580
because you don't do a lot of stuff.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.563
I was trying to look at other stuff.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.650
I was scared to ask you,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.740
'cause I never wanna ask my famous friends

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.030
to do something and make
them feel obligated to do it

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.310
just cause they're friends.
- Yeah.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.993
- So I was very gentle about
it, and you're like, "Sure."

00:02:26.993 --> 00:02:30.124
In your bubbly Alexis Renn
way, and then I was like,

00:02:30.124 --> 00:02:32.500
I'll book her on a day that Milo's there,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.890
so she'll feel comfortable
because they know each other.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.723
They're friends.

00:02:35.723 --> 00:02:37.103
- I know, did you see
our entrance earlier?

00:02:37.103 --> 00:02:37.936
- I know it was crazy.

00:02:37.936 --> 00:02:39.170
- Oh my god, them greeting each other

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.113
was one of,
- [Alexis] It was like a

00:02:40.113 --> 00:02:41.204
dirty dancing hug.
- [Milo] I know, for real.

00:02:41.204 --> 00:02:42.037
- I was like, are you guys filming

00:02:42.037 --> 00:02:42.983
a package for Dancing with the Stars?

00:02:42.983 --> 00:02:44.513
- I honestly fell back on
Dancing with the Stars.

00:02:44.513 --> 00:02:45.623
- Why is this hug taking five minutes,

00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:49.490
but I appreciate you saying
yes that you'd be here,

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:51.440
but you would have not said yes

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.150
had you known it was
7:00 A.M. and not P.M.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.900
- I thought when you meant
show, I thought you meant

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.940
like a show that like I go and sit down.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.583
- Dude, are you joking me.

00:03:00.583 --> 00:03:03.910
- Yeah, so when you texted
me, I was like, "A.M.?"

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.930
And then I thought about it,
and I was like, "Oh, no."

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.553
I would have said yes, like
if I would've known earlier.

00:03:08.553 --> 00:03:09.870
- You thought a comedy show.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:10.768
- Yeah.

00:03:10.768 --> 00:03:12.055
- That you were gonna
sit in the crowd for.

00:03:12.055 --> 00:03:13.164
- From like 7 P.M. to 9 P.M.,

00:03:13.164 --> 00:03:14.710
and I would just come and then hope to god

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:15.873
you wouldn't roast me.

00:03:15.873 --> 00:03:17.120
- Oh my god.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.113
And then this is so
different than what that is.

00:03:20.113 --> 00:03:20.946
- Very different.

00:03:20.946 --> 00:03:22.975
- And then I gave you, I
just kept giving you outs,

00:03:22.975 --> 00:03:25.840
because I just didn't ever
want you to just be here

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.430
and not wanna be here, and you
didn't take any of my outs,

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.670
and I appreciate you being here, because,

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.340
and I appreciate all of you being here.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.244
This is, I can't believe how
stacked this deck is, today.

00:03:36.244 --> 00:03:38.280
- It's pretty good.
- We're chillin'.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.492
- This is star power.

00:03:39.492 --> 00:03:40.325
- [Andrew] This is big time.

00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:41.158
Alexis was here.

00:03:41.158 --> 00:03:42.240
She was here pretty early.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.670
I pulled in she was already there.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:44.617
- Oh really?

00:03:44.617 --> 00:03:47.210
- [Andrew] She was there for
like three or four hours.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.043
- [Alexis] So you know how you

00:03:48.043 --> 00:03:49.470
have to write a note on your car?

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.063
- Yeah, I know that's part of it.

00:03:51.063 --> 00:03:52.515
- I didn't have a pen.

00:03:52.515 --> 00:03:54.570
So I used my eyeliner.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:55.850
- Oh my god!
- Oh, wow.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.170
- [Andrew] That works.
- That's the most Alexis move

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.003
I've ever seen you pull.

00:03:58.003 --> 00:03:58.836
- It does work.

00:03:58.836 --> 00:04:00.793
It works just like eyeliner.

00:04:00.793 --> 00:04:02.270
Or just like a pen.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.250
That's such a good idea.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.950
I've done it a bunch.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.860
Also, make up, not only can work as pens,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.480
but blush can work as eye
shadow can work as lip stuff.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.450
- It's all a scam.
- Don't limit yourself.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.360
- Anything, it's all the same.
- It's all the same.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.441
And they keep making up
new stuff that we need.

00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:18.320
- They're like a lip stain.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.030
I was like you can use
that anywhere on your face.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.315
- A lip stain can be used everywhere.

00:04:22.315 --> 00:04:23.148
- I don't even know what that is.

00:04:23.148 --> 00:04:24.540
- Yes you do.
- See.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.373
- After Dancing with

00:04:25.373 --> 00:04:26.344
the Stars?
- Lip stain?

00:04:26.344 --> 00:04:27.643
- You don't know?
- Do you miss your

00:04:27.643 --> 00:04:28.614
spray tans, Milo?

00:04:28.614 --> 00:04:29.820
- Stop, I'm gonna cry.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.040
- Okay, these two cutie
patooties are catching up

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.203
about Dancing with the Stars
because they went all the way.

00:04:35.203 --> 00:04:36.483
They went to the finals Andrew.

00:04:36.483 --> 00:04:37.870
- [Andrew] Really?

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.120
- They were in the top four.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.424
They both lost.

00:04:40.424 --> 00:04:41.414
(laughs)

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:44.043
Let me remind you both that you lost.

00:04:44.043 --> 00:04:44.876
- She's not wrong, she's not wrong.

00:04:44.876 --> 00:04:46.250
- Who was worse?
- But we lost together.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.670
- Who lost more tragically?

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.270
- No we went down, we went down.

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.103
- Just both bad?

00:04:51.103 --> 00:04:51.936
- That's the thing.

00:04:51.936 --> 00:04:54.940
It's like I guess there's a
place, like everyone places.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.200
I didn't really know the placing.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.033
I don't care to know.

00:04:57.033 --> 00:04:57.987
It doesn't matter.
- [Milo] Yeah.

00:04:57.987 --> 00:05:00.710
- You guys all won, all
the top four won, 'cause--

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.470
- Cause you got to dance the last dance

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:03.800
that you possibly could.
- Exactly.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.683
- You got as much screen
time as everyone else.

00:05:05.683 --> 00:05:08.830
- As many dances as you
could've done, we did.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.050
- I remember when we first met.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:11.537
We were at Good Morning
America and I was like,

00:05:11.537 --> 00:05:14.400
"Wouldn't it be cool is we made
it to the finals together?"

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.348
- We did it.

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:16.181
- We did it.
- We did it.

00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:17.014
- That's huge.

00:05:17.014 --> 00:05:18.784
- I honestly, I'm gonna
say this right now.

00:05:18.784 --> 00:05:20.210
I don't think I've ever told you this,

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.690
but when we were at Good
Morning America the first time,

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.704
I've said this on the show before,

00:05:23.704 --> 00:05:25.643
but I want you to hear it.

00:05:25.643 --> 00:05:28.163
When I met you, I totally
knew who you were.

00:05:28.163 --> 00:05:29.254
- I knew you knew who I was.

00:05:29.254 --> 00:05:30.087
- Okay you're good.

00:05:30.087 --> 00:05:31.824
- And then you unfollowed
me, then you followed me.

00:05:31.824 --> 00:05:33.052
- Was I not that smooth?

00:05:33.052 --> 00:05:34.363
- You think I don't fuckin' know that?

00:05:34.363 --> 00:05:35.710
- So you just kept unfollowing
her, and following her,

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.833
just so she would see it?
- No, I unfollowed her,

00:05:37.833 --> 00:05:38.850
- Trolling hard.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.657
- So he could be back stage, and be like,

00:05:40.657 --> 00:05:42.374
"Are you on Instagram?"
- Who are you?

00:05:42.374 --> 00:05:43.544
What's your name?

00:05:43.544 --> 00:05:47.063
I had been following her for
like three years or something.

00:05:47.063 --> 00:05:49.840
- I know, and you liked some
of my photos, and I knew that.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.680
- That's what gave it away.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.890
Also, I tagged you in a
photo of mine two years ago

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:56.200
as a joke, 'cause I was
getting on a private jet

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.674
and I tagged myself as Jay Alvarez

00:05:57.674 --> 00:05:59.230
and my friend was Alexis Renn.

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.920
- Oh god.
- I know.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.590
- So, you instantly saw through it,

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.530
because you knew who he was,

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.064
and knew that he had liked
something of yours before?

00:06:08.064 --> 00:06:09.403
- I didn't know who he was.
- At the time.

00:06:10.424 --> 00:06:12.972
- But once I found out who
was gonna be on the show.

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:13.805
- Burn!
- Roasted.

00:06:13.805 --> 00:06:15.290
- Sorry, sorry.

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.240
- You went back in?

00:06:17.203 --> 00:06:18.036
- I did my research.

00:06:18.036 --> 00:06:19.210
I was like, "Who's gonna
be on the show this time?"

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.687
- I have a lot of hope for these two.

00:06:20.687 --> 00:06:22.414
- That's really nice that this is

00:06:22.414 --> 00:06:24.970
who unfollows and follows each other.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.670
Mine is like, there's a dude that trolls

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.875
me lately that's almost naked.

00:06:29.875 --> 00:06:31.680
He's got his six pack.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.513
Yeah, I'll show you the photo.

00:06:32.513 --> 00:06:33.740
He does it every single day.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.740
He unfollows and follows and
then likes a bunch of pictures,

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.100
and then probably unlikes
them, and likes them again.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.000
I think I gotta fuck this dude.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.156
- Is he into you sexually?

00:06:40.156 --> 00:06:41.267
- [Andrew] Yes!

00:06:41.267 --> 00:06:43.340
- You have to, the effort!

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.330
Alexis, if every guy
who put that much effort

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:47.000
to get your attention on Instagram,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.560
you had to have sex with,
you'd be a busy lady.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.360
- Oh god, that's disgusting.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.193
- I know.

00:06:52.193 --> 00:06:53.510
I'm sorry to even put that image in.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.363
He was the one that brought up
he has to have sex with him.

00:06:55.363 --> 00:06:56.237
- Time consuming.

00:06:56.237 --> 00:06:57.340
- Well I have a lot of dude trolling.

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.843
- I'll send my DMs your way.

00:06:58.843 --> 00:06:59.676
How about that?
- Yeah, please.

00:06:59.676 --> 00:07:00.509
I love it.

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:01.342
I actually collect them.

00:07:01.342 --> 00:07:02.710
Some of the girlfriends of
mine, I send, my friend Allie,

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.480
I make her send me all
the like filthy nasty shit

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.260
that dudes DM her, 'cause I just keep 'em.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:08.414
I think they're so much fun.

00:07:08.414 --> 00:07:09.414
- Yeah, they're pretty.

00:07:09.414 --> 00:07:10.247
- Some of the shit are odd.

00:07:10.247 --> 00:07:13.790
Some guy like, "I want
you to fart in my mouth."

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:14.623
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah.

00:07:14.623 --> 00:07:15.520
We get that one all the time.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.170
- Wait, what!
- I was like, yes, yes.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.563
- Girls get that one all the time.

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:19.982
- Do it!

00:07:19.982 --> 00:07:21.104
I wanna find the dude now,
- It's pretty bad.

00:07:21.104 --> 00:07:22.260
- But I can't.
- I don't get that at all.

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:23.843
- They're trying to get your attention.

00:07:23.843 --> 00:07:25.104
- That's because your fans are 14.

00:07:25.104 --> 00:07:25.937
- Yeah, that's true.

00:07:25.937 --> 00:07:26.770
They're 10 years old.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:27.880
- That's because you
don't love her enough.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.240
I'm just kidding.
- Yeah.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.600
- They really see her,
and read her energy,

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.840
and know that that's exactly
what she wants to hear.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.000
They're trying to get your attention.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.833
- [Milo] Yeah.
- [Alexis] Yeah, that's true.

00:07:36.833 --> 00:07:38.100
- I feel like a lot of these DMs

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.800
they know that maybe you're bored,

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.260
and you are gonna go through the requests,

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.270
you know what I mean?

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:45.820
And they need to stand out some way,

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.080
so they say, I wanna
do something like that.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:48.913
- For sure.

00:07:48.913 --> 00:07:50.700
They'll make group chats, like dudes.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.841
- Oh my god.

00:07:51.841 --> 00:07:52.674
I've been in a lot of group chats.

00:07:52.674 --> 00:07:54.900
- Big dick energy, like group chats,

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:58.219
and it'll just be five guys
trying to get my attention,

00:07:58.219 --> 00:07:59.060
- Oh geez.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.040
- And the most inappropriate.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.928
- It'd be way more clever if
it were little dick energy.

00:08:01.928 --> 00:08:03.000
- That's not how you do it boys.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.288
That's eye catching.
- A bunch of dude's little

00:08:04.288 --> 00:08:05.121
dicks braggin' about it.
- That's eye catching.

00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:06.690
- So if you're funny.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:07.700
- What's your aim there?

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.847
- If everyone's like,
"Collectively we're 10 inches,

00:08:09.847 --> 00:08:13.240
"there's 14 of us in this."
- All of us could not

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.320
please you together, but ultimately,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.090
if you culled us all together.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.260
I mean, there's so many, I'm on group.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.240
People are group DMing me about you,

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.003
and they all have Milo.

00:08:25.003 --> 00:08:28.400
They all have versions of
your name in their name

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:29.440
in their handles.
- Oh yes.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.110
- Milo's pants, Milo's eye.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.420
- Everything.
- Milo's shirts.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:34.600
- If you make it up.
- Milo's left toe.

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.340
- Yeah, Milo's left toe
is definitely one of them.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.602
- And I made the mistake
of engaging with them.

00:08:39.602 --> 00:08:40.960
- There's definitely Milo's lobes.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.102
I know for a fact.
- Lobes?

00:08:42.102 --> 00:08:43.370
- But that's because you have that

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.230
weird thing where you like.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.640
- Whitney has always been
touching my ear lobes

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.792
since we met, and that was like the thing.

00:08:48.792 --> 00:08:49.625
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:49.625 --> 00:08:50.731
- On Dancing with the Stars.

00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:51.564
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:52.397
And I always put posts
- Lucky.

00:08:52.397 --> 00:08:53.483
- About it on my, exactly.

00:08:53.483 --> 00:08:54.680
Posts about it on my story all the time,

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.050
and there was a bunch of
ear lobe accounts that

00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:59.840
they literally, if I post a
picture with a water bottle,

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.660
it'll be like, Milo's
water bottle underscore.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:02.493
- Oh, you know what they would do

00:09:02.493 --> 00:09:03.811
to get that water bottle, man?

00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:04.960
- [Milo] They would pay a lot of money.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.610
- I used to be one of these girls,

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.220
and when you're obsessed with a guy,

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.310
and you're coming of age,

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:12.190
and you're having all
these feelings about boys

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:13.470
that you don't even understand,

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.920
and it's like lust.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.622
It is, it's this intense energy.

00:09:16.622 --> 00:09:17.455
- It's bad.

00:09:17.455 --> 00:09:18.288
It's addiction.

00:09:18.288 --> 00:09:19.680
- You feel like, "I will have him."

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.672
If we meet, we will date,

00:09:21.672 --> 00:09:24.100
and I understand feeling
- It's going to happen.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.140
- The fan, the standing
obsession of this guy

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:28.930
that you feel like you know,

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:30.860
and you're obsessed with
every little thing about him.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.640
- Do you remember your first crush?

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.220
Like your first, first real one?

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.209
- Like star, celebrity crush?

00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:39.449
- No, like a crush that was attainable?

00:09:39.449 --> 00:09:41.470
That never happened.
- Yeah, but he wasn't

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:42.303
attainable.
- Yeah, like he was,

00:09:42.303 --> 00:09:44.178
but he wasn't.
- Like he was in

00:09:44.178 --> 00:09:45.150
my science class, but wasn't.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.330
I mean, who was your first crush?

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:47.163
Do you remember?

00:09:47.163 --> 00:09:50.330
- Oh my god, so I was homeschooled,

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.507
and in my homeschooling group.
- So your dad?

00:09:52.507 --> 00:09:53.407
Just kidding.

00:09:53.407 --> 00:09:55.779
You're like, it's just proximity.

00:09:55.779 --> 00:09:58.158
Okay, so you were homeschooled.

00:09:58.158 --> 00:09:59.140
No way.
- I was homeschooled

00:09:59.140 --> 00:09:59.973
my entire life.

00:09:59.973 --> 00:10:01.140
Never been in a classroom.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:01.973
- What!

00:10:01.973 --> 00:10:03.339
- Yeah, weird, right?

00:10:03.339 --> 00:10:05.507
- Milo, bring her to school today.

00:10:05.507 --> 00:10:07.078
Just to show her a classroom.
- [Milo] I know!

00:10:07.078 --> 00:10:08.820
My school is a riot.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.750
It would go crazy.
- No, I'm good.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.640
But I do wanna come to your graduation.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.767
- Oh, you're totally invited.

00:10:14.767 --> 00:10:15.876
- I'm definitely gonna come.
- You're invited too,

00:10:15.876 --> 00:10:16.709
by the way.

00:10:16.709 --> 00:10:18.684
- Really?
- We should all cheer him on.

00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:21.184
- I'm just gonna stand
outside by the way and watch.

00:10:21.184 --> 00:10:22.255
I'm not invited.
(laughs)

00:10:22.255 --> 00:10:23.760
Just wave from the outside.

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.720
Hey guys, is it fun?

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.770
Sir, we're arresting you.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.906
I'm with that 17 year old boy.

00:10:29.906 --> 00:10:31.965
(laughs)

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:34.382
(rock music)
