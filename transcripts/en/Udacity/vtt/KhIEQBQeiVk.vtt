00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now I confess, I've been oversimplifying it because we haven't talked about friction.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Now even though energy can never ever be created or destroyed,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
friction in a way removes energy from a system.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now what do I mean by that. Well before we ??? let's say a ball dropping from some height.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Well, we can think of this as energy converting from gravitational potential

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to a kinetic energy as it moved in.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
All of the gravitational I want to connect, but in reality that's not what happens.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
All of the gravitational potential energy does not get convert to kinetic energy.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
How did friction do this? How does it remove energy if energy can't be created or destroyed?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Well before when we look at, let's say a block sliding down a plane.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We visualized this as gravitational potential energy

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
getting converted to kinetic energy as the block moved down, but let's think about that.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
As this blocks slides down, it's rubbing against this plane.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Go ahead and rub your hands together for a second and do it really hard.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
They get really hot. In fact, friction creates heat. This heat is another form of energy.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If we start with a certain amount of gravitational potential energy,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
some of it gets converted to useful kinetic energy, but some gets lost as heat.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The energy is still there, it's just that we can't really use it anymore. It's lost as heat to the atmosphere.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Now depending on the material of this plane or other situational factors, the fraction of this energy

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that gets converted to heat can change,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
maybe a lot of this energy gets converted to heat maybe almost none of it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So let's consider these three cases.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
In the first case, we have an object falling and let's say it's falling to what's called vacuum

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
so there's no air, it's just falling through empty space

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Another example of object sliding down this rough jagged surface.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Another we have an object sliding down a relatively smooth surface.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What I want to know is, which of this diagrams corresponds to which of this pictures.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So in this diagram all of the potential energy is getting converted to kinetic energy

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and here most of it is getting converted to heat, but in here only a small portion gets converted to heat.

00:01:59.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Enter the appropriate number into the appropriate box.
