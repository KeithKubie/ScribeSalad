00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.580
Jupiter could be considered an independent
solar system, only in miniature form.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.269
The gas giant has the same basic ingredients
as the sun and is surrounded by dozens of

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.710
geologically diverse moons.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.860
Out of the 79 confirmed surrounding Jupiter,
four ancient moons have astronomers really

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.230
excited because they offer up some of the
most distinctive geology in the solar system,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.300
including clues of deep, subsurface oceans
that could be home to life.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.660
The Galilean moons are named after Galileo
Galilei, who first observed them in 1610.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.890
Io, Jupiter’s closest Galilean moon, is
unusual because its composition is closer

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.680
in comparison to the terrestrial planets than
the icy bodies that surround it.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.780
Io is also the most volcanically active body
known in the solar system

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.160
with over 400 active volcanoes.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.460
This is due to the internal heating produced
by the pulling and stretching effect of Jupiter's

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.280
gravity and smaller neighboring moons on Io
as it orbits Jupiter.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.180
That same tug-of-war heating effect is the
reason why some astronomers believe that Jupiter’s

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.870
second Galilean moon is home to a deep subsurface
ocean up to twice the volume of Earth's oceans.

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.901
Unlike Io, Europa has an icy surface, but
below it, astronomers think there may be a

00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:30.310
salty ocean that could harbor life-bearing
chemistry, including organic molecules.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.420
When Europa swings by Jupiter on an elliptical
orbit, gravitational tidal forces stretch

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.440
and flex the sides of the moon,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.060
creating internal friction that essentially heats the moon from the inside out.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.340
Using its Europa Clipper spacecraft in the
2020s, NASA plans to get a closer look at

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.460
the moon in order to confirm the existence
of a potential ocean.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.160
Europa’s neighbor, Ganymede, is also believed
to have an ocean hidden under its thick icy shell.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.160
The moon’s magnetic field may be affected
by an electrically conducting layer from within,

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.480
which hints at the existence of a liquid saltwater
ocean.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.239
But Ganymede’s distance from Jupiter means
there’s a weaker tidal force at play, so

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.790
it’s less likely that liquid water is present.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.340
The moon is the only one in the solar system
known to have a magnetosphere, protecting

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.660
its surface from harmful radiation and solar
wind.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.600
As Jupiter’s largest moon, Ganymede would
be considered a planet

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.000
if it were orbiting the Sun.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.209
Out of all four Galilean moons, Callisto is
the farthest from Jupiter.

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.060
The moon is purported to be one of the most
heavily cratered objects in the solar system.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.970
With some impact basins expanding to about
2,600 kilometers across, these craters could

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.420
teach us a lot about the formation of our
early solar system, as astronomers believe

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.700
its surface hasn’t changed in over four
billion years.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.930
Unmanned spacecraft have been conducting flybys
of the Galilean moons for decades and findings

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.860
from these missions suggest an even greater
presence of water.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.079
Along with NASA’s Europa Clipper, the European
Space Agency’s JUpiter ICy moons Explorer

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:19.660
aka JUICE will gain a deeper understanding
of the moons’ mysterious properties.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.450
But getting to these moons will be no small
feat since the craft will need to slingshot

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.560
around the Sun and then travel about 800 million
kilometers before being caught by Jupiter’s

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.499
massive gravitational pull.

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:36.750
If the spacecraft can survive this arduous
journey and manage to generate enough energy

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.040
to travel between the moons, astronomers will
gain an unparalleled glimpse into what lies

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.480
beneath their surfaces, which could even result
in the discovery of the

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.160
first forms of life beyond Earth.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.319
Space Crafts takes you through the depths
of the cosmos, explaining bizarre astronomical

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.230
phenomena and crazy plans for future exploration.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.000
In this episode, we explain how an advanced
civilization could harness

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.300
the total energy of a star.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.700
