00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.040
We want the FetchWeatherTask to
return an array of string forecasts.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.840
This means we need to modify
the return type of the AsyncTask to be

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.160
a string array.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.100
The effect of this is that the
doInBackground method will now return

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.530
a string array.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.085
In this method,
after we query the server and

00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:21.660
then read in the input stream,
we're going to perform this code.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.600
To parse the response from the server,
we call getWeatherDataFromJson.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.540
We pass in the forecast JSON string,
as well as the number of forecast days.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.290
To make sure that this is
returning the right string array,

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.650
we can go into the method, and then at
the bottom of the method, we just add

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.990
some logging statements to print out
every element of the string array.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.550
Now, when you compile the code and
run it on your device,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.060
you can hit the Refresh button to
pull the data from the server.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.650
Then, if you open up log cat, you can
see that it was parsed correctly,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.020
where you see all the forecast
entries being printed out.
