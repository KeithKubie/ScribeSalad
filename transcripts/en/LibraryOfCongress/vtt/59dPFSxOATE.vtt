&gt;&gt; ANYA CREIGHTNEY: Hi,
everyone, glad to be here.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.790
I'm representing the
Poetry Literature Center

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.130
and specifically Rob Casper who
you may normally know in this role.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.710 position:56%
He's with the Poet Laureate tonight,
so he won't be able to join.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.040
So, I'm thrilled and
delighted to be here instead.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.600
So, thank you Mary Ann, where

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.000

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.670

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.910

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.050
to explore the poets
work, the Ron Charles,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.240 position:56%
so we're all in for a treat tonight.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.030 position:56%
I do want to take this
opportunity to tell you a little bit

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.540
about the Poetry and Literature
Center at the Library of Congress.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.450
And now I would like to
introduce Brenda Shaughnessy

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.580
for the Spring kick-off of
our Life of a Poet series.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.740
Brenda Shaughnessy's latest book,
So Much Synth, has been named one

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.680
of the best poetry
collections of 2016,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.430
by Publishers Weekly,
and the NY Times.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.230
Her third book, Our Andromeda,
published in 2013, was short listed

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.560
for both the Pen Open Book Award

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.540
and the International
Griffin Poetry Prize.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.220
Taken together, her first and
second books, Interior Sudden Joy,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:00.360
and Human Dark with Sugar,
garnered eight honors.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.190
A James Laughlin Award,
and nominations for Land

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.460
of Literary Award and a Norma
Farber First Book Award among them.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.090
Shaughnessy earned a BA in
literature in Women's Studies

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.880
at the University of
California, Santa Cruz,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.150
and an MFA at Columbia University.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.830
Her poems have appeared widely in
Best American Poetry, McSweeney's,

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.610
New Yorker, Paris Review, The
Yale Review to name a few.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.300
In 2013, she became a
Guggenheim Foundation Fellow,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.590 position:56%
and recipient of a Howard Foundation
Fellowship from Brown University.

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.230
She's also received fellowships
from the Radcliffe Institute

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.800
where she was a Bunting Fellow, and
the Japan/US Friendship commission.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.710
She is the Poetry Editor-at-large
at Tin House Magazine

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.130
and assistant professor of
English at Rutgers, Newark.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.500
Mary Jo Bang, herself a
Life of a Poet reader,

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.340
said of Brenda Shaughnessy, "her
Voice is smart, sexy, self-aware,

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.380 position:56%
hip, consistently rye of her savvy."

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.610
Hilton also, believes
Shaughnessy read sequentially,

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.000
presents a speaker
swathed in a cocoon,

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.580 position:56%
a keen and incisive
self-scrutiny who undergoes a series

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.270
of empowerment's and
connections that turn her

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.700
into a ferocious source;
a col louses.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.830
For me Shaughnessy is
all about the corporeal.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.530
The physical body as normative,
legitimate, gazed upon,

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.450
tremendous but oft flawed.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:45.550 position:56%
Her poems, the other corpus are
quick looping, vivid and propelling.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.050
Her attention is expertly
slant, urgent and desirous,

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.300
or put even more simply dazzling.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.700
We are lucky to have
her with Ron Charles

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:02.900
to help us further understand the
impact of this essential work.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.970
So without further ado please help
me in welcoming Brenda Shaughnessy.

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.270
[applause]

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:19.280
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: I'm so glad you're
here, thank you so much for coming.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.580
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY:
Thrilled to be here.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:24.830
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: I've had
the tremendous experience

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.950
with reading your books in
sequence, as she just said,

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.750
they really are remarkable,
and dazzling, and witty

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.500
and sad, all at the same time.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.470
I wanted to start with
your first book, called,

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.580
Interior with Sudden Joy.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.330
That collection's very much
of the body, wouldn't you say?

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.630
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Mm hum.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.510
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: I wonder if
you'd read a poem called, Swell.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.780
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: You know
nobody ever asks me to read Swell.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: I did not know that.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.870
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: But I heard
that you had an uncanny ability

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.550 position:56%
to pick poems that no one ever asks.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:04.620
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Does it include
words you know how to say out loud?

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.330
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Oh yeah.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.580
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Cuz that
happens to me all the time.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.880
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY:
No, this book is filthy

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:17.330
so you really can't include
anything here that's...

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.890
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: I went around
some of the more filthy ones.

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.190
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Swell.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.630
Svelte with eventual sex.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:30.290
Who could help but gorge yourself
on low violet leaning everywhere.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.270
The shine and shifting slate

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.920 position:56%
of the sky murmurs it's irresistible
confession, I am more than blue

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.550
if you are the violet imprint.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:46.250
I am swollen, vexed, endlessly and
only finite against your bodies.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:49.950
This slim stalk of
silhouette slides via nimbus

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.810
down the eye lights
without a skirmish.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:58.810
Glossy the sly undoing,
glister like, we are disheveled,

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.780
though to skeptical to abandon our
dimpled lens and fill the insides

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:07.450
of slips with mere threat
and straight of thunder peal.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.810
We toss freely with fever, this
mirror disilvered and break

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:18.120
into rain upon finding such under
yielding of frost to feverous.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.450
This strumpet muscle under your
breast describing you minutely,

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.750
volupt, volupt.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.010
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It
just announces itself,

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.920
this is a voice you
have not heard before.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.110
The language is so
alive, so surprising,

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:36.510
so daring, syntactically.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.950
And the subject too.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.580 position:56%
What was it like for you to announce
yourself with poems like these?

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.930
What did it feel like?

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.220
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: At the
time you're not really announcing

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.550
yourself, you're really just
scrapping around in your notebook.

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.360
Trying to figure out, oh what ...

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.050
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: What
feels right to you?

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.350
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY:
What you're about.

00:07:57.350 --> 00:08:01.660
That book was a book I
wrote in my twenties.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:12.690
And I think that I felt ..., I
think that I felt so disempowered.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:17.470
I think that I felt so lost, that
I just wanted to take the language

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:20.990
and just go, ooooooooo, you
know and try and make it

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.290
into something that was mine.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.610
You know, and so I think that
was sort of the gist of it.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.620
Did I think anyone
would read it, or ...?

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.970
No, I thought it was just sort
of a weird little exercise

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:36.090
that I was doing at
home, like what do I do,

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:37.820
like Zumba, at home to save money.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.870
You know, sort of like that.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:43.830
Or maybe do your own version
of Zumba, just your own way ...

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.580
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Who
were your poetic models

00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:49.040
when you were writing
lines like that?

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.830
Lines that use alliteration ...

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:53.630
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Yeah,
I feel really vindicated,

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.990
because at the time when
I was writing this book,

00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:59.990
my heroes were E.E. Cummings and
Silvia Plath and at that time,

00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:01.890
those were embarrassing choices.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:03.510
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Why?

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.610
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: You remember
it was written 20 years ago,

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.840
if you like Plath you were
put into this category,

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.490
oh you just like the goth,
suicidal girl, essentially.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:15.790
Now she's ...

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.150
in twenty years her reputation,
she's now completely understood,

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.110
in pretty much all corners, it's
just like she's a totally genius

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.310
and her ability to
like get at the reality

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:27.980
of things is now understood
to be unparalleled.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.560
For some reason she was
sort of under estimated.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.650
I love E.E. Cummings, and he
still kind of has a reputation

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:39.630
of being a word play
guy, but I loved it.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.940
I love the way they both
pull language apart.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:43.240
I was fascinated by it.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.540
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: And
have fun with it,

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.180
especially with E.E.
Cummings, and you do that too.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.480
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: So much fun.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.250
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: And the
subjects you write about in

00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:50.930
that book are very, very intimate.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.500
For someone who felt
powerless, who felt a little ..

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.950
well what was that like?

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:57.250
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY:
It's so strange ...

00:09:57.250 --> 00:09:58.700
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: To write so
intimately about your own body

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.000
and your own sexual experience.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Yeah, I know,

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.600
but I thought that I was
keeping it all a big secret.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.620
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Because you
never thought the publication.

00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.920
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: No,

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.220
I never thought anyone could
understand what I was saying.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:10.710
I thought I had such a you know ...

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:14.410
except those people who wear
dresses with lots of beads on it

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.500
and then they're back lit
and it's totally see-through

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:17.800
and they don't realize it.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.010
It's kinda like that.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:26.970
But, one example is that, my
Grandmother on my father's side,

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:33.870
who was very conservative, very
religious, I was sort of running

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.340
around as an outed
lesbian in my twenties,

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.810
and she didn't know
that I was closeted.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.100
When this book came
out, I always thought

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.540
of her as somewhat illiterate.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.840
I always thought she
was somebody like,

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.550
she didn't read, she
didn't like poetry.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.300
Interested in any of that.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.280
No of the arts, none
of that was practical.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:55.830
No of that entered her psyche, but
she got ahold of one of these books

00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:01.320
and told my cousins, it's
disgusting, it's all sex.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.100 position:56%
And I thought like, how do you know?

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:15.340
How did you read this slinky,
lesbian, sex book so accurately?

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:16.760
You know I just couldn't
figure it out.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.490
I was surprised I felt seen,
and not is a happy way,

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.850
I felt like oh god that
my cover was blown.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:25.500
If even my Grandma can
see that this is ...

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.800
just so lustful.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.070
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Well
sometimes you can't see it

00:11:29.070 --> 00:11:31.110
in your poems, you can feel it.

00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:33.390
Because you've broken the
syntax in strange ways.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.200
You're not always clear with the
explicit sense of the sentence

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.320
but you can feel what's going on.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.620
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Right.

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.450
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It sounds to
me that you started writing

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:46.010
in a diary in your teens.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.310
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Yeah.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.610
Always, when I was a kid.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:51.700
Anyone still have any
of their old diaries?

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.330
I would give anything
to still have them.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:54.630
You still have them?

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.130
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Aren't
they humiliating?

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:58.430
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Sure.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:05.730
But then also I was still me,
I was me all the way back then.

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:10.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: In your latest book,
you have a long spectacular poem.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:12.860
A sort of sum of myself
poem, that you all must read.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.380
It's too long to read
here, it's about 30 pages.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.990
It's called, Is there
something I should know?

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:23.660
It is one of the great poems about
what it's like to be a woman.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:24.960
To grow up.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.260
To be an adolescent.

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.560
To go through this society.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.860
I just think it's remarkable.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.160
I wonder if you'd read
the first part.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.020
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Yeah.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:38.020
Um, are there any gen-xers who
recognize the title of that?

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.320
Is there something I should know.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:44.860
No? It's a Duran Duran song.

00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:49.290
The title of a song by
a band that existed.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.490
The first part?

00:12:53.490 --> 00:13:00.410
Okay. If I were 14 again I
wouldn't be in this situation now.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:02.720
Trying to write without a pen.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.270
Isn't blood a woman's ink?

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:06.820
Back then whatever I scratched

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:09.890
into my well filled ill
hid diary was my existence

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:14.540
and those scribblings, fast
as I could think or slow

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.640
as carving a spell, forward
moving outer periphery

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.840
of me the inner lining.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.930
The rest of me, juice, some sponge,

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:27.250
electricity like synth riffs not
interested in bringing light.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:31.350
Sometimes I just doubt rage and
hurt, yearning for finer feelings.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:33.730
Not the indignities I suffered,

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:38.370
but if I suffered sharply I
could scarcely trace it soft.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.990
You think you pretty dork,
spat at me at school.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:46.210
Transcribed as swirly ugly vortex,
stupid me, alone in my room later,

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.170
I scrounged for the
words, keeping the scope

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:54.380
of the vault very open universal,
somehow dramatizing and minimizing.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:59.310
"The worst thing in the whole world
is that nobody cares, not even me."

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:00.610
Who was I kidding.

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:04.220 position:56%
Even in my private diary I performed
myself to an audience of one.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:07.420
No one. A stocked character
play to an empty house,

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.020
though I've no theater
experience at all.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.480
I lied outright, wrote
day dreams of true,

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.410
was all knowing, and exquisite.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:17.680
Simultaneously was the worst
person ever to have lived.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:21.480
Adolescence is all absolutes, if
bad one must be the very worst

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.610 position:56%
to avoid being mistaken for average.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:26.990
To be ordinary was
just being invisible.

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:30.730
I'd surely slow naked death
by ants hurt less than that.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:33.590
The middles was always for losers.

00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:35.730
The middle seat, the middle
aged, the middle child,

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.310
the middle finger,
middle school, midland.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.580
I remember writing,
one thing I know,

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:44.460
I definitely am not is a
totally bizarre person.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:46.780
Only a few years later,
my entire persona

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.970
so craved a real and
lasting bizarreness.

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:53.690
I fashioned it out of my relentless
wholesomeness, easily, actually,

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:55.650
because hallucinogens are
great for making you think

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.830
that you actually are weird.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:14:59.130
But that came later.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.230
In junior high I was a kid under
the impression I was supposed

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:03.320
to act grown up.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.150
And that meant knowing who I
was and how groups started,

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.890
or shaped like on the bus, or
at lockers, if you didn't go

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:11.810
to the same grade school as a lot
of people who all knew each other.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:15.240
And what to wear and how my
own body worked at least.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.120
At least how to become
friends with people I

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.340
like without just mimicking
them and trying to figure

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.170
out how to join their group.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:25.970
But how? And boys can tease you
or yell anything, do anything.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.770
How'd you know where you stood?

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.340
Every scene, lunch, PE,
English had different rules.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.640
Invisible.

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.660
They changed depending
on who had power.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.680
That was never you.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.920
You couldn't just be
yourself anywhere.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.610
There was an amazing story of me.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:45.500
One that I would live
powerfully in red velvet poetry.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.770
And this is a quotation from the
Duran Duran song, "and you wanted

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:54.040
to dance so I asked you to
dance, but fear is in your soul."

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.730
The voice of Simon LeBonn
permeated all those new cells,

00:15:57.730 --> 00:16:02.390
the bloody ones, the ripenings,
and I knew his love was deep.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.900
Too deep, maybe.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.450
How'd you know what
everything he sang meant.

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:10.200
He was also a little shiny,
the perfect pretty pout

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.000
of John Taylor however, with that
sunken chest, fetishist forever

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.870
after that was new romantic,
graceful, not as lured as make-up

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.300
as Nick Rose, but still
breathtaking in girlish man-ness.

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:22.600
Perfect. Perfect.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.830
All absorbed in brooding
sounds and slow distant love

00:16:25.830 --> 00:16:29.620
that maybe insinuated sex, but
was more like hopeless desire.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.300
A beautiful man mooning over me?

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:34.600
Much emotional clutching

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.990
of said sunken treasure
before glamorously running

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.820
down the wet tarmac in a flappy
linen suit to catch a plane

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.250
to the next, some people
call it a one night stand,

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.170
but we can call it paradise.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:47.740
Yes, I'd be left newly
a woman, languid

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:51.560
and a little tearful thinking about
my erotic awakening in the bungalow

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:58.890
by really of any Duran
Duran except Andy.

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:02.270
No one liked Andy.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:06.510
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: What did writing
in that diary do for you now?

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:08.860
That poetry does for you now?

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:14.300
Anything? Is there any kind
of satisfaction or ...?

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:15.650
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY:
Yeah, it's that split-ness.

00:17:15.650 --> 00:17:20.230 position:56%
That sort of split existence where
you get to be, simultaneously alone,

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:23.000
and completely free
inside your mind.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.760
With this other sort of fantasy,

00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.320
that you're actually expressing
yourself and being heard.

00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:33.480
So it's the same thing, you
get to have this two-in-one

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:38.750
but you never really have ...

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.880
Our life, and inner life are
often just totally separated.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.650
You say one thing but we
secretly are thinking,

00:17:44.650 --> 00:17:46.640
how do I get out of this room?

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.940
I gotta get out of here.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.740
Meanwhile you think, lovely.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.400
With writing you're not
trying to please anybody,

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.840
you have this amazing freedom
but yet there's this yearning

00:17:55.840 --> 00:18:00.040
to be understood, heard,
listened to.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.710
So that's the process.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:04.010
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: The girl you were,

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:07.050
writing in that diary creating
this persona of yourself,

00:18:07.050 --> 00:18:10.230
someone you aren't at
all anymore, at the time.

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:11.590
Why write poetry now?

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:15.160
Why not write prose
or plays, or letters?

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.400
What is it that drives
you to poetry?

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Because
young, very young people, teenagers,

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.500
they start writing poetry, right?

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.350
Because it's seems dramatic.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:26.850
It's just the dramatic
parts, none of the filler.

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:30.310
No scene setting, character
development, it's just like get

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.320
to the drama, the emotion.

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:37.260
And then I guess eventually
you learn

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:40.190
to appreciate all those
elements of life,

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:44.360
but sometimes you just get
kinda arrested, in that moment

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:49.570 position:56%
where you want to seek intensity and
it feels like that's a new reality.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:50.870
I got stuck there.

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:54.050
I got stuck there, and it just
seemed like that possibility

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.490
of making a whole piece
of art that was this long.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:57.790
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yes.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:59.940
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: And the
page, maybe it was terrible.

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:03.450
You know, but It can be finished,
it can be done, and it didn't have

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:08.470
to sort of be this
thing way out of you ...

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:10.860
you know you could
start a novel, right?

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.720
And you can say, with
best intentions

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.620
and I'm going write this
every day and keep writing

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.060
and writing until it's done.

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.360
Maybe that happens,
maybe it doesn't,

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.560 position:56%
but with a poem you can sort of just
say this is the world at this moment

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.990
that I'm going to make and it feels

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:25.840
like you actually accomplish
something.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.640
Even if it's not good.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.550
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Some of your poems
make it sound much more painful

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:32.770
than that.

00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:34.200
Let me have you read one.

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.500
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Well
you gotta externalize there,

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:36.800
otherwise it's stuck in you,

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:38.560
and then you're stuck
having it be there.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.860
You've sort of ah ...

00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.880
it has to move.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: My 26 year old self.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:46.820
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Why?

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:51.450 position:56%
I told Craig my husband that I did
not want to put these poems in here.

00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:54.630
The letters to my former selves.

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:55.930
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: They're good.

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.230
They are very good.

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:58.530
They're funny and poignant.

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.140
It's not long.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.690
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: I know.

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:05.840
To my 26 year old self.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.860
You really are being
such a poet aren't you?

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:10.160
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Now what
did you mean by that?

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.810
That sounds very preparative.

00:20:13.810 --> 00:20:15.400
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY:
I'm mocking myself.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.230
I'm so annoyed at myself.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.180
This is a moment where ...

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.660
this is a self-loathing poem.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:29.980
So, it's me as an older poet
talking to this 26 year old poet.

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.910
26 year old self, who's
just starting

00:20:31.910 --> 00:20:33.420
to imagine herself as a poet.

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.910
You really are being
such a poet aren't you?

00:20:35.910 --> 00:20:38.940
Ten dollars a week is the food
budget and that's day old rolls

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.880
for the freezer and looking for
butts, and considering the offer

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:44.840
from friends who can get you
a job at their strip club.

00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:48.740
But you're too fat to be a stripper
you say, starving down to nothing

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.620 position:56%
but this the life of an artist you
say, even when the electricity shuts

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.890
down and the cop on the
corner offers you cocaine

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:56.190
if you'll fuck him.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.250
But you need money, not drugs.

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:01.370
You write poems in the dark and
tell your friends you're dieting

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.890
but later at the posh lesbian bar,

00:21:03.890 --> 00:21:06.510
when she leaves her ten
dollar lychee martini to go

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.880
to the bathroom, you steal
it and promise in your head

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.740
to write some lousy poem for
her later to pay her back.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: That sounds like it
was a real struggle as a young poet?

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:20.110
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: What?

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:21.410
Being really, really poor?

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:22.710
Hell yeah.

00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.010
It's terrible.

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:25.340
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: And you had the
skills, you were well educated.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:26.970
You could have done other things.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:29.250
You stuck with it.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.850
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY:
It was very foolish.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.640
It was a very foolish decision
to say I just want to be a poet.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.550
My parents were appalled.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:41.060
It's just, it's a ridiculous
thing to do.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.250
I just ...

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.170
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: What was it
that made you stick with it?

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.810
With that sort of humiliation
and poverty,

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:50.700
and even hunger it sounds like.

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:54.410
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY:
People like drama

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.930
because it proves they're alive.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:22:02.260
You know? I did have this sense
that you kinda had to go out there

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.180
and live all these, live the
full range of feelings in order

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:07.680 position:56%
to have material to write the poems.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:12.550
I didn't realize that life would
just throw terrible things at me.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:13.850
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You didn't
have to look for them.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:15.700
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: I didn't
have to look for any material.

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.270
Material just kinda ...

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:24.720 position:56%
this is a youthful, this is a person
looking back at her misperceptions.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:34.400 position:56%
But it never was about the posturing
and the excusing and trying to sort

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.570 position:56%
of say, well this is how artist are.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:47.680
It was a way to, it was a
way to, what's the word?

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:52.760
Create a holding pattern
so that I could develop

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:55.910
as a reader and as an artist.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:23:00.900
I had to stay alive and
I did all those jobs.

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:05.420
I was a receptionist
for seventeen years.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:09.290
Part time on and off,
starting when I was 16.

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.060
I did all kinds of other jobs.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:14.540
I felt like wanting to be a poet.

00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:15.840
It was the only thing
that was going to keep me

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.900
from being totally ordinary.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.770
And like I said earlier in the
other part, it just didn't,

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:28.970 position:56%
it seemed like being a poet was the
coolest thing you could choose to do

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:37.980
and this was a way of maintaining,
sort of validating that idea.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:41.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: In another one of
your poems you say, "I'm most afraid

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:45.980
of panicked mind alone,
silent at the end."

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.810
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: See when
you take it out of context ...

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:49.110
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: That's not fair.

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:51.300
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: It
makes me think, did I really?

00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:53.500
Is that? Is that the worst thing?

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:58.260
Each poem is a moment and sometimes
they go back and forth in time,

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:02.470
where I'm actually recalling a
feeling, and sometimes it's sort

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:03.770
of recording that moment.

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:05.070
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It's
not fair, I understand.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.130
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY:
But I don't remember it.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:11.370
I don't remember what
that's even from.

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:12.670
Did I write that?

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:14.270
I believe you.

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:17.910
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Paradox plays such
a delightful role in your poetry.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.910
Sometimes for comic effect,
sometimes for tragic effect.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.240
You write in one poem,
"artists though

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.290
of themselves putrid with paradox."

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:29.520
That's a funny line.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:37.090
And you've got a poem called Drift.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:39.390
(inaudible)

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:45.760
&gt;&gt; I'm curious about
what kind of truth.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:49.790
What kind of larger point
is produced by paradox.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.090
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Yeah.

00:24:51.090 --> 00:24:52.390
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: What
does a paradox say

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:55.590
that an explicit statement
could not say?

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:58.280
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Rob Casper
published this poem in (inaudible).

00:24:58.280 --> 00:24:59.840
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Oh really?

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:02.310
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Drift.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:05.600
I'll go anywhere to leave
you but come with me.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.150
All the cities are like you anyway.

00:25:08.150 --> 00:25:10.520
Windows darken when I
get close enough to see.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.950
Any place we want to
stay is polluted,

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:17.510
the good spots taken already
by those who ruin them.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:20.360
And restaurants we'd never find.

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:26.200
We'd rut in a ditch
by a river in night.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.160
I just saw a typo.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.110
We rut in a ditch by a river in
night so long they must be cut

00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:37.080
by the many pairs of wrong-handled
scissors maybe God owns

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.870
and doesn't share.

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.410
I water God.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:43.340
I make a haunted lake
and rinse and rinse.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.690
I take what I want, and have ever

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:50.130
since what I want disappeared,
like anything hunted.

00:25:50.130 --> 00:25:51.550
That's what you said.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:56.040
Disappointment isn't tender,
dried and wide instead.

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:58.790
The tourists snapped you crying,
and the blanket I brought was

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:02.020
so dirty it must have been
lying around in lice and blood

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:04.100
that whole year we fought.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.140
It wasn't clear, so I forgot.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:12.630 position:56%
I haven't been sleeping, next to you
twitching to bury my boring eyes.

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:16.740
The ship made you sad,
and the ferry, and canoe.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.820
All boats do.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:21.320
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It's a
love poem in a sense.

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.620
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY:
That was a sad time.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.810
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Sad one.

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:28.230
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: So paradox,
what is the use of paradox?

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:34.970
Um. I don't know who said this
thing and I think it could be used

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:42.240
for equally sort of freedom,
happiness and also fascism.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.760
This idea that sort of any truth,

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:50.510
also a really interesting truth
its own inversion is also true.

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:53.970
This idea that the opposite

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.500
of something is actually just
another version of itself.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.020
I'm fascinated by this idea.

00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.710
It comes up over and over again.

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:04.280
One of the great explorers of this
idea is a poet, James Richardson,

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.590
he does this in his
affirmations a lot.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:10.690
Kinda of take that whole thing
and split it apart and find

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:13.700
that the parts that make the
whole are sort of the opposite

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.460
of itself, or the outlines of it.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:20.600
Any way it's a way of thinking
that I'm really fascinated with.

00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:21.900
I've always have been.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:28.220
So paradox, you know, when we look
at something that seems unlikely,

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:35.980
you have to go to what
splits them and unites them.

00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:40.300
What's the scene between the two
elements that seem like jarring?

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:44.710
I'm interested in that
line, I've always have been.

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:50.360 position:56%
I think that as a bi-racial
person, like I've always felt always

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:56.270
on both sides of that, that very
way of being feels like a paradox.

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:58.570
If you're talking about race.

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.900
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Right.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:08.050
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: It doesn't
come down to math or physiology.

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:09.350
It doesn't come down to science.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:10.650
It doesn't come down to ...

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:14.330
it comes down to something
else that's inevitable.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:22.000
I'm curious how many ways we
are actually living paradoxical

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.060
constructions where we sort
of think the categories.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:29.120
You know. So, that
seems important to me.

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.420
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: That
makes a lot of sense.

00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.090
The basic good structure for
a poem about relationships

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:37.890
that gives you joy and
sorrow at the same time.

00:28:37.890 --> 00:28:39.190
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Yeah.

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:44.060
You have a lover or a partner and
you always think, love is so happy

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.070
and wonderful, you're
actually in love

00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:48.370
with the person, this is terrible.

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:49.670
This person whose brought me

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.510
so much joy has actually
given me so much pain.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:56.760 position:56%
Of course they're totally together
and this is the amazing word cleave,

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:59.720
cuz it means itself
and its own opposite.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:02.850
Contronyms I think they're called.

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:06.010
I'm fascinated by those.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:09.860
But also too, it's not just in love
poems, although love poems are so,

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:15.440
they sort of yield
this concern so well.

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:21.080
But, the question of being
a parent also has this to.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.520
Like is this a child
that's separate,

00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.820
or is this also a part
of me and how do I?

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.570
There is no way to reconcile it.

00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:32.370
Whatever scene there is
between the two beings is fluid,

00:29:32.370 --> 00:29:34.890
it keeps changing,
it doesn't really.

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:37.040
It doesn't stay still.

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:43.440
That line is a constant
in so many things.

00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.110
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: That's
very illuminating.

00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:47.730
You wrote a poem about
studying the (inaudible).

00:29:47.730 --> 00:29:50.590
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: I did
write a poem about (inaudible).

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:52.010
I totally regret that I did that.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:55.100
r third collection begins,
'Artless is my heart',

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.400
that's really not true.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.180
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Would
you like to red it now?

00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:59.480
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: No,
can we skip that please?

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.780
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It
will become a part

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.570
of the Library's permanent
collection?

00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:08.180
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY:
It's ok that I said that.

00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:09.480
It's yeah.

00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:10.920
Yeah.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:14.990
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Your
third collection begins,

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:17.030
"Artless is my heart."

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:18.330
That's certainly not true.

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:19.630
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: It is.

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:20.930
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Is not.

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:22.230
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: It is.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:23.530
Because artless is
that old fashioned word

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:25.740
which means the opposite
of what you think it means.

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:28.530
You think of the word artless
you think it means without art.

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:33.010
Without aesthetic, without beauty,
but it's this old fashioned word

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:35.860
where you know the meaning, she's
artless, usually about guile,

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:40.470
she's not fake, she
doesn't have these wiles.

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:42.190
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Right.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:44.730
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: So
it kinda means both things.

00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:47.220
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yes, in a poem
called the Lamp Garden you write,

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.950
'as you start to write a page it
doesn't appear appallingly blank,

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:54.410
something is soothing, encouraging,
like steam on the bathroom mirror

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:56.980
that wishes you to
draw your face in it.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.000
You can tell, when a
sentence is hard to write,

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.460
whether it's because
there's a knot in your throat

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:05.270
or in the tree before
it was your tablet.

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:09.720
Do you feel that there's a physical
relationship with a blank page

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:12.430
when you sit down to write a poem?

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:13.730
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Yeah.

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:19.000
Yeah. That is such a much better
question then do you use a computer

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.300
or a pen.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.810
It's just a ....

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:31.230
because I do think ...

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:33.160
things are very physical.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.460
You're joking right?

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:36.280
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: I was
not gonna ask that?

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:43.140
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: I think
physically of my head expanding

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:49.650
and going back like bride
of Frankenstein's hair.

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:55.060
Or Marge Simpson is another good
kind of example, it sort of,

00:31:55.060 --> 00:32:01.790
I'm not trying to visualize
this, it's like a back brain

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:06.480
and it opens up, and that part
I can't see it and it opens

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:12.460
up and it's like a portal.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.680
So whatever's happening
on the blank page,

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:18.070
it looks like the blank
page except for,

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:22.230
do you remember those pictures
we used to have at malls?

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:24.040
They're called magic eye.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.180
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Oh yeah,
I never could see it ...

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:28.480
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY:
You stare at it.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:31.570
This is just a bunch of dots ...

00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:32.870
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Could you see it?

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:37.880
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: I could,
sometimes, but it was not

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:41.890
until I was really
frustrated, you look at the dots

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:47.230
and someone was like, it's a
dolphin and you were like, ugh!

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:54.520
And you can't will
yourself, it's about relaxing

00:32:54.520 --> 00:33:00.580
and so the blank page is thing
where it's always mocking you.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:06.330
It's like, it's like looking at
you saying, you can't do it again,

00:33:06.330 --> 00:33:10.530
I don't think you're
going to be able

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:14.120
to do it again, what do you got?

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.670
What do you got?

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:17.850
You got nothing.

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:19.270
Here's the proof.

00:33:19.270 --> 00:33:23.290
But I tell myself that
every writer has to start

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:24.590
with a blank page, that's ...

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:28.590
you can't write on the back of the
thing that you finished writing.

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:29.890
You start again.

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:34.510
So the back brain helps
me in this confrontation.

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:37.750
It is a confrontation and sometimes
it's at the level of the pen

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:42.160
where I'm just sort of looking at
it going, this is gonna be bad.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.540
This is ...

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:47.160
maybe it's good, and then
this horrible I don't know ...

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.460
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: The
steam on the mirror is

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:50.070
such a great encouraging image,
cuz everyone wants to do that.

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:51.370
Everyone likes doing
it, it's fun to do.

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:52.670
It totally takes the
intimidation out of the blank page.

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:53.970
I think. It's a great
way to think about it.

00:33:53.970 --> 00:33:55.270
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Yeah.

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:56.570
I haven't thought about
that in a long time.

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:57.870
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It's
very fun to do that.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:59.170
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: I haven't
done that in a long time either.

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:00.470
I'll try it again.

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:02.990
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Would
you read a Poet's Poem?

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:06.470
Then I want you tell us
what a poet's poem is.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:11.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Well you know
there's a thing called a poets poet.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:17.020
This is alike a love poem to poets.

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:19.130
Just how hard it is to be a poet.

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:20.710
What it's like to be a poet.

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:22.040
A Poet's Poem.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:27.120 position:56%
If it takes me all day, I will get
the word freshened out of this poem.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:31.470
I put it in the first line,
then moved it to the second,

00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:33.910
and now it won't come out.

00:34:33.910 --> 00:34:35.210
It's stuck.

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:40.380
I'm so frustrated, so I went out to
my little porch all covered in snow

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:44.120
and watched the icicles drip,
as I smoked a cigarette.

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:46.280
Finally I reached up
and broke a big,

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:49.540
clear spike off the
roof with my bare hand.

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:52.360
And used it to write
a word in the snow.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.820
I wrote the word snow.

00:34:54.820 --> 00:35:00.580
I can't stand myself.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.940
How circumscribed we are.

00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:07.480
The nowhere of that circumscription
and the self-loathing.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.770
I own it.

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:16.100
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: The physical act
of leaving your pen at your desk

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:18.760
and going out and grabbing
this giant frozen pen

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:21.120
and writing in the earth.

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:22.620
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: But only
being able to come up with it's ...

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.660
like it doesn't need
to be re-inscribed

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:26.480
because it's the exact same word.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:29.170
That was all I could think of.

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:30.470
That's the point.

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:31.770
That's all you got?

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:34.970
I'm already snow.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:37.780
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You know
the poems' wit deconstructs

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:42.350
that sort of self-loathing.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:50.820
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Yeah,
that's why I agreed to read it.

00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.120
[laughter]

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:57.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: We're going to stand
up, turn around and sit back down.

00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.120
[pause]

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.420
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Ok.

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:02.530
Let's sit down please.

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:13.900
As a young woman did you look
forward to becoming a mother?

00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:18.530
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: I didn't
think I was going to do that.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:24.090
No, I didn't think I
was going to really.

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:25.520
I didn't know.

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.140
Honestly. I thought maybe,

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:33.910
but I didn't really have
a clear idea of that.

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:37.240
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: In that
great poem I mentioned,

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:40.790
Is There Something I Should
Know?, there's this great line.

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:43.210
"Basically all the stories that
I'd heard about what it's really

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:45.940
like to become a woman
made me rather expected

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:50.180
to gorgeous liquid-fication after
which I would emerge a cross

00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:53.330
between Jessica Rabbit
and Denise Huxtable."

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.860
Was it like that for you?

00:36:56.860 --> 00:36:58.160
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: No, the rest

00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:03.470
of the poem explains
it was much rockier.

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:09.950
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Your
life has been punctuated

00:37:09.950 --> 00:37:13.210
by a particular tragedy
surrounding your family.

00:37:13.210 --> 00:37:18.760
You write in another poem, 'not
knowing how to grieve can poison

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:21.010
like a directionless dart.'

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:26.330
In this series, we talked with
Ed Hirsch and Mary Jo Bang

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:29.120
about the death of their sons.

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.740
Horrible unspeakable tragedies

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:34.670
that they found poetic
language to speak about.

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:40.570 position:56%
You experienced something different,
in the poem, you describe the birth

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:46.370
of your first child Cal, like this,
"you were hardly alive, hardly you,

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:54.030
horribly slimed chance,
I blacked out hard,

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:56.600
but I heard you were blue."

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:03.280
In that moment, one vision
of your sons future died,

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:08.490
but he remained very much
alive, and someone to celebrate.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.340
That was the strangest thing for
me, when that happened to me.

00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:20.320
After a perfectly normal pregnancy,
our daughter was born dark,

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:24.300
dark blue and not breathing
for about 5 or 6 minutes

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:27.890
and the while future that
we had projected was gone,

00:38:27.890 --> 00:38:30.280
and another future that
we didn't know anything

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:34.640
about as now first
time parents was born.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.320
In a poem called Our
Andromeda you imagine

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.560
that distance parallel worked

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:44.940
in which your son gets
the babyhood he deserved.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:50.750
You think you can read
that first section?

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:57.080
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: I
almost never read this one.

00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:02.970
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You can
just read there and there.

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:05.140
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: When
we get to Andromeda Cal,

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:06.940
you'll have the baby
that you deserved.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:10.640
All the groping at light sockets
and putting sand in your mouth,

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:13.660
and learning to say Momma and I
want and sprinting down the yard,

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:18.900 position:56%
as if to show me how you are leaving
me, for the newest outpost of Cal.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:21.140
You'll get the chance to
walk without pain as if

00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:24.530
such a thing were a matter of
choosing a song over a book.

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:27.490
Of napping at noon
instead of fighting it.

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:30.710
You'll have the chance to fight
every nap, every grown up decision

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:34.770
that bugs you, and it will be
a fair fight this time Cal.

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:41.130
In Andromeda you will win.

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:44.660
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: What challenges,
emotional and artistic did you face

00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:49.560
as you made the decision to
write about your sons experience

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:55.410
and your experience with him?

00:39:55.410 --> 00:39:58.570
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY:
Well, it's strange.

00:39:58.570 --> 00:40:05.730
We were encouraged to sue
the hospital and the lawyer,

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:10.440
the hospital since went bankrupt
so there wasn't very much for Cal.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.030
But the lawyer didn't...

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:14.570
put a gag on Craig and me.

00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:18.110
Wouldn't let us write
anything about Cal.

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:20.130
In our poems, in our ...

00:40:20.130 --> 00:40:25.190
they subpoenaed my diaries,
they were very very concerned

00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:27.210
with the idea the defendants,

00:40:27.210 --> 00:40:30.550
the hospitals defendant
could make an argument

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:33.330
that we were not profiting
from his thing

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:35.530
so they wouldn't let us
write anything at all.

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:37.180
So we weren't allowed
to write anything.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.480
We weren't allowed to express ...

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.460
it was a gag that went
on for a few years.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:45.820
So, I wrote, I started
writing what I really felt.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:47.830
Knowing that it wasn't real.

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:51.310
Knowing that it wasn't going to
be published, that it was just me,

00:40:51.310 --> 00:41:00.940
that I had to get this out, and
I wrote most of it at Yardo.

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:05.660
I was in Katrina's room at Yardo.

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:09.810
Now Katrina was this sort of
the women who started Yardo,

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:13.140
had three children who all dies.

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:19.320
So there was this sort of thought
that Yardo was kinda haunted.

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:25.040
So there I am I had given
birth to a beautiful baby boy

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.730
who was really disabled,
really compromised

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:31.430
and we didn't know what
was in store for him.

00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:36.520
And I had gotten this precious
two weeks, and there I was alone

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:40.450
in this room, this beautiful
room of a woman who lived there

00:41:40.450 --> 00:41:42.780
after suffering the
death of her three kids.

00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.080
I just ...

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:47.900
the pen just flew it just flew ..

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:51.190
and the first part is
what happened to me,

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:52.490
I had happened to be since then.

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:55.330
But this was the first time I just
happened to be writing and crying

00:41:55.330 --> 00:42:01.120 position:56%
onto the page so it was like, it was
smearing the ink, the pages were wet

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:05.980 position:56%
and it was just, I just told myself,
this isn't a thing, it isn't real.

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:08.560
This isn't a real poem, this
is just me getting it out.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:12.530
I can be as angry as I
want, I can blame anybody,

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:15.120
I can say whatever I
want I can blame anybody,

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.470
I don't have to be fair,
I don't have to play

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:22.920
by any rules I can just
say what is inside me.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:29.590
Because no one can ever
see it, and my son's alive.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:37.050 position:56%
I owe it to myself to explore all of
that, so that I can get to a place

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:40.230
where I can celebrate him.

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:44.660
So we can see him for what he
is and not what happened to him.

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.850
But really get there with him.

00:42:46.850 --> 00:42:50.300
I had to get all this
anger, all this rage,

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:55.940
all of this terrible
terrible grief out of the way.

00:42:55.940 --> 00:42:59.700
Then the lawyer said, guess
what, the hospital went bankrupt,

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:02.140
you can write whatever
you want we don't care.

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:06.110
There's no more, the kid's not
going to get money so I don't ...

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:10.530
so we don't care what
you do with your writing.

00:43:11.730 --> 00:43:15.780
I didn't know if I would have
the courage to think of this

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:21.080
as a real poem, but it got there.

00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:23.400
It was the most profound
writing experience I'd ever had.

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:29.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: How do you resist
some natural problems with a subject

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:33.340
like this, like mortality?

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:37.940
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Natural
problems or national problems?

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:40.700
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Natural problems.

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:42.960
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY:
I don't I felt

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:47.690
like the most important thing
was I couldn't be afraid.

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:54.300
I'd never been a mom before
so I felt like if I sound

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:57.930
like a doting mother who thinks
their kids the most amazing thing

00:43:57.930 --> 00:43:59.690
in the world, screw it.

00:43:59.690 --> 00:44:05.170
Fine. Give me that I'll take it.

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:06.470
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yes.

00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:11.510
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: I'm
sort of more afraid of the ...

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:14.100
basically I felt I've
been lied to so much

00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:17.160
about motherhood that
I read was about.

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:20.530
Like, it's so beautiful and
amazing, you feel so fulfilled

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:25.630
and I was just like, ugh this
is like the worst, like saddest,

00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:29.780
grueling, grading, devastating,

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:32.430
pulverizing thing I've ever
been through, and I just felt

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:36.940
like if I'm going to say anything
at all that means anything to me.

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.240
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yes.

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.240
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: I have to
find some words for that truth.

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:43.810
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: How do you keep
your sense of blame and guilt

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:45.500
from just consuming
you and the poem?

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:47.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: I don't know.

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:51.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You say in this
section, "it's all my fault you see.

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.300
I can blame just about anyone
for what happened to you

00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:59.170
but it was ultimately my job to get
you into this world, and I failed.

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:02.340 position:56%
There's no other way to look at it."

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.190
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: I mean,

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:06.750
I can tell myself that's
not what I really believe,

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:09.360
but I can't make myself believe it.

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:12.640
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Did writing
that help you realize

00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:14.740
that was not in fact
the whole story?

00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.760
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Yes.

00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:21.390
This is where sort of notions
of motherhood lie to one.

00:45:21.390 --> 00:45:24.940
They say your job is
to protect your kid.

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:27.650
You have no choice
but to feel this way.

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:28.950
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yes.

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:30.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Did I write
this whole poem to try to get myself

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.960
out of feeling this terrible guilt?

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:39.270
Maybe. It definitely
failed, if that's the case.

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:43.530
Getting it out meant at
least I wasn't afraid

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:45.660
of admitting it anymore.

00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:49.290
It's to me, I didn't know
at the time that I wrote it,

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:56.000
but the hardest time of
dealing with Cal's injuries

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.190
and subsequent medical
stuff and surgeries,

00:45:58.190 --> 00:46:04.390
and all the stuff was the months,

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:08.860
after his diagnosis
before I could except it.

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:11.440
When we got this terrible
diagnosis, he's not going to walk,

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:14.610
he's not gonna talk, and we're
just feeling like, no, no, no,

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:17.320
no that can't happen, that
can't be true, that can't be.

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:19.910
That was the most painful
time of my life.

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:25.090
It was when I finally accepted
it and said okay you know what,

00:46:25.090 --> 00:46:28.070
this kids gonna have a
different kind of life,

00:46:28.070 --> 00:46:35.110
time for to just let
it end, let it happen.

00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:38.750
Just stop fighting it.

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:43.610
And that's really at
the very least what

00:46:43.610 --> 00:46:46.110
that moment in that poem can do.

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:50.970
I'll always blame myself,
I'm the mom.

00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:52.270
What else, I mean ...

00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:55.440
I can't open the role up bigger.

00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.130
To pretend that's somehow
that's never gonna be there.

00:46:58.130 --> 00:46:59.610
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: But
now you have days

00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:02.880
when you aren't thinking
about it all the time.

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.180
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Yeah.

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.480
Yeah.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.780
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: But there was a
time that you could not imagine

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:09.810
that you couldn't think
about it every minute.

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:13.070
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY:
It's kinda always there.

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:18.690
I mean it's just that it's not
all rage, and terror and grief.

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:24.700 position:56%
It's also this really deep adoration
and sweetness and tenderness

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:27.610
and there's really other things.

00:47:27.610 --> 00:47:31.080
The sad thing when something
happens to your kid, makes you feel

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:32.770
like this is how's
it's always gonna be,

00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:35.960
but no matter who your kid
is they change and develop

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:41.940
and you relationship changes and
there's so much new that happens.

00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:44.420
I didn't know that.

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:47.720
I thought that I'd always
be stuck feeling that way.

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.480
I couldn't bare it.

00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:53.970
Writing poems did make me feel like
it was pushing the process along

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:56.280
or moving the emotions around so
at least they didn't get stuck.

00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:00.830 position:56%
I did think that if those emotions
got stuck the way they were it would

00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:02.200
be so toxic.

00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.510
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Yes.

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:08.040
You write about your
friends and how they

00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:09.700
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY:
My so called friends.

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.210
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: really let you
down in ways that I recognize.

00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:13.510
So bitter.

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:14.810
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY:
Did that happen to you?

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:16.500
It does feel really
painful, isn't it?

00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:17.800
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It's amazing.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:22.100
Our favorite line, one of our best
friends telling us months later,

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:24.760
"I sensed something was
wrong so I didn't call."

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.710
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Yeah
we got a bunch of those.

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:31.230
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You refer
to them as, "their toxicity

00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:32.530
of their shit on their lives ..."

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:34.510
something along the line like that.

00:48:34.510 --> 00:48:37.060
How did you get the
courage to write about them.

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:38.540
I'm sure that they
would read these poems,

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:40.430
they might even recognize
themselves, or maybe not,

00:48:40.430 --> 00:48:42.000
in their own self-righteousness.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.320
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Yeah
I don't think people tend not

00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:45.870
to recognize those faults.

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:48.030
Al the fiction writers
say all the big villains

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:51.100
in these memoirs never
recognize themselves.

00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:52.850
That person was awful.

00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:54.150
You're like it's you.

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:56.460
I have never had anybody ...

00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:58.580
I've had people think
that it was them.

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:01.740
I've had people say, I
don't really even know you.

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:09.380
I mean you had to be there
in my life to have done this.

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.710
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You said that
the childhood friends were okay.

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:14.410
That they reacted in
a way of humanity.

00:49:14.410 --> 00:49:18.210 position:56%
The parents with their own perfect
children terrified into viciousness.

00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:19.570
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY:
It was terrible.

00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:23.050
They just dumped us.

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:26.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: You've become a
kind of symbol of their worst dread.

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.010
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Yes.

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:32.520
But the poem was a lot of
bargaining, it was like,

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.230
you should be happy, it happened to
my kid not yours, you should look

00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:37.890
at it and be like phew
that happened to you,

00:49:37.890 --> 00:49:39.600
I'm over here, I'm relatively sick.

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:44.430
That's not how it works.

00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:45.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: It's a long time ...

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:47.370
you're not getting a fair ...

00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:52.820
it's a long complex
problem, it moves the speaker

00:49:52.820 --> 00:49:59.760
through a beautiful and
very, very painful process.

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:12.090
I wanted to ask if any of the
friends recognized themselves.

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:26.630
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: I would
be so satisfied if they did.

00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:34.100
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Would you read the
final part of, "Our Andromeda'?

00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:35.500
[pause]

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.080
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: The truth.

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:41.440
I've been wrong, or I've been
lying or I've been ignorant.

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:45.450
It doesn't matter which, but
now it's time to give it up.

00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:51.560 position:56%
You've came from Andromeda Cal,
that other galaxy came to me, to us.

00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:55.500
The moment you were born, when the
membrane between the world snapped,

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:58.550
and all that alien world
love flooded my body.

00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:02.830
It came from you, there was awful
confusion because you didn't seem

00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:04.130
to be of this world,

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:06.840
and the ordinary humans
didn't know what to do.

00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.270
Not even me.

00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:09.630
Mommy and her stories.

00:51:09.630 --> 00:51:11.500
Those fairytales we have.

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:13.010
Wretched and unending.

00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:14.310
Children lost in woods.

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:18.450
No wonder you always looked
at me so quizzically a story

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:21.800
like that is too tiny to
contain Andromeda and you,

00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.870
lost in the Milky Way magical boy,

00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:27.620
weak from his first
intergalactic journey to my arms.

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:29.290
I found you didn't I?

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:37.070
I'm here, we found each other.

00:51:37.070 --> 00:51:38.460
We are here.

00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:44.470
[crying] This is why I
don't usually read this.

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:48.110
And here is where we belong,
for here is where you are you,

00:51:48.110 --> 00:51:52.090
exactly you, not some other
boy in some other world.

00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:54.190
I was wrong to mourn so.

00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:56.990
He deserves better and
so forth you are better.

00:51:56.990 --> 00:52:02.380
Better than any rested
truth I could invent.

00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:05.830
I open my eyes form that long dream
to find you here my perfect child.

00:52:05.830 --> 00:52:08.740
You taught me the truth Cal.

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:12.570
Accept the truth from whoever gives
it the ancient said to your people,

00:52:12.570 --> 00:52:14.690
the truth is you are the truth.

00:52:14.690 --> 00:52:18.690
A child born to a liar
who is learning to change.

00:52:18.690 --> 00:52:23.440
A dashing boy who may never walk,
who traveled so far to be here.

00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:25.150
A joyful boy who may never talk

00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:28.660
who ruthlessly teaches
the teacher the truth

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:32.090
about where children really live.

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:37.970
Where you are alive, you are the
most perfect Calvin Lakota Teicher

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:39.970
of the Universe.

00:52:39.970 --> 00:52:44.450
A tough, funny beauty of a boy who
holds my hand and blinks his eyes

00:52:44.450 --> 00:52:48.170 position:56%
until I'm excruciated mad with love.

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:52.410
How hard it was for you to convince
me that I deserve that love.

00:52:52.410 --> 00:52:57.700
My glorious son, a mother's
boast is never mere delusion.

00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:01.870
A mother knows if she can
forgive herself for not knowing.

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:05.960
I know now Cal, your frail
arms are perfect arms.

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:09.220
Your uncertain eyes, perfect eyes.

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:12.130
Your anguish, your illness
your pain, your difficulty,

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:18.030
your discovery, your joy is my
joy, it is a perfect boundless joy.

00:53:18.030 --> 00:53:21.730
God must exist, a god
for me after all.

00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:27.540
And he must be good, everlastingly
so, to have given you to me.

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:30.270
I don't need any more
proof then this.

00:53:30.270 --> 00:53:34.920
You in my arms, your little
searching fingers on my face.

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:38.650
Wistful, graceful stars
on a wet clear night.

00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:42.400
Galaxies exploding everywhere
around us, exploding in us Cal,

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.670
faster than the lightest light.

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:48.750
So much faster than love, and
our Andromeda, that dream.

00:53:48.750 --> 00:53:53.300
I can feel it living in
us, like me, it's home.

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:56.090
Like it remembers us
from its own childhood.

00:53:56.090 --> 00:54:03.410
Our maybe Cal we are home,
if God will let us live here

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:08.020
with Andromeda inside us,
doesn't it seem we belong?

00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:09.970
Now then will you help
me belong here?

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:13.740
In this place where you became
my child and I your mother,

00:54:13.740 --> 00:54:17.660
out of some instant of
mystery of crash and matter,

00:54:17.660 --> 00:54:20.000
scattered thought he cosmos.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:25.000
God scooped and poured toward our
bodies with so much love somehow.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.970
I am so tired I cannot
beat my own heart anymore.

00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:31.110
Cal shall we stay?

00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:32.690
Oh let's stay.

00:54:32.690 --> 00:54:34.570
We've only just arrived here.

00:54:34.570 --> 00:54:40.380
Rightly, whirling and weeping
freely, breathing, brightly born.

00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:49.090
&gt;&gt; RON CHARLES: Such
a triumph of a poem.

00:54:49.090 --> 00:54:52.840
I don't think that I have
anything left to say.

00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:54.500
Thank you so much.

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:56.710 position:56%
I'll just never forget this evening.

00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:58.010
&gt;&gt; BRENDA SHAUGHNESSY: Me too.

00:54:58.010 --> 00:54:59.610
Thank you.

00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:01.910
[applause]

00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:05.570
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
