Westwood: Hi. My name
is Dave Westwood.

00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm the co-founder
of BuddyPoke!

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.167
And the engineer
of a team of two.

00:00:09.167 --> 00:00:11.701
Uh, Randall Ho, my friend,
is the other member of the team,

00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:13.467
and he works on the content,

00:00:13.467 --> 00:00:16.167
and the content pipeline,
and the avatar creation.

00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:18.100
Uh, we're currently known
for one application

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.200
called BuddyPoke!

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.567
It's a 3-D avatar
poking app, uh,

00:00:21.567 --> 00:00:24.634
that's on many, uh,
OpenSocial networking sites.

00:00:24.634 --> 00:00:27.968
We first released, uh,
BuddyPoke! on--on MySpace

00:00:27.968 --> 00:00:29.400
in early April.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.901
And App Engine
came out, um, in mid-April,

00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:34.400
and we immediately
jumped on it.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.567
Um, it's been a godsend
in--in terms of, uh,

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:39.934
scalability over the last
several months.

00:00:39.934 --> 00:00:45.000
Um, it only took about a week
to port App Engine.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.934
And that was porting
to Orkut.

00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:50.200
So let me show you a demo
of, uh, BuddyPoke!

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.801
running on Orkut.

00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:55.234
Okay, so this is BuddyPoke!
running inside Orkut.

00:00:55.234 --> 00:00:56.934
When a user first adds
the application,

00:00:56.934 --> 00:00:58.434
they're gonna see
something like this.

00:00:58.434 --> 00:01:01.434
It's a very kind of vanilla
avatar.

00:01:01.434 --> 00:01:03.901
We have the tools over
on the right-hand side here

00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:06.634
to personalize your avatar.

00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:08.501
You can go through
and you can--

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:10.634
you can customize
your hair.

00:01:10.634 --> 00:01:12.701
Give yourself
some hair streaks.

00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:13.901
That kind of thing.

00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:17.234
For now, let's just pick
a preset.

00:01:17.234 --> 00:01:21.000
You could basically create
a kitty, or an army man,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.801
or maybe a little
goth girl.

00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:25.067
So let's save her.

00:01:25.067 --> 00:01:27.934
And we're now looking

00:01:27.934 --> 00:01:30.634
at some of the BuddyPoke!,
um, actions

00:01:30.634 --> 00:01:32.634
that users
have already done.

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:38.167
So here's--I'll just go
through some previous events.

00:01:38.167 --> 00:01:40.734
And you get a general
feeling for what you can do.

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:43.100
It's all about creating
an avatar.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.100
You now have a personal
connection with this avatar.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.601
It's either representing
yourself,

00:01:47.601 --> 00:01:49.100
or it's representing,
you know,

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.133
some character
that you like.

00:01:51.133 --> 00:01:56.133
Might be a fantasy character
or a famous star.

00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:58.834
And then you can basically
poke a friend.

00:01:58.834 --> 00:02:05.033
So we have glump, hug,
kissing.

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:10.334
We have soccer
for our Brazilian fans.

00:02:10.334 --> 00:02:13.267
Guitars.
That kind of thing.

00:02:13.267 --> 00:02:15.167
So let's save a poke.

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:18.267
And for those people
that initially add the app,

00:02:18.267 --> 00:02:20.701
they don't typically have
many friends.

00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:24.701
So we have, uh,
we have mood changes too.

00:02:24.701 --> 00:02:27.400
And we can just be
meditating.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.534
So it's actually a very simple
application to use.

00:02:31.534 --> 00:02:34.767
There's pretty much
three, um, things you can do.

00:02:34.767 --> 00:02:37.334
Customize your avatar,
change your mood,

00:02:37.334 --> 00:02:39.000
and poke a friend.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.100
And we're working on this--
images over on the side here.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.601
So let me explain to you
how that actually works

00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:50.067
in terms of utilizing
App Engine on the server side.

00:02:50.067 --> 00:02:52.400
If you look at this graph,
you can actually see

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.667
we've had a very fast growth
on Orkut.

00:02:56.667 --> 00:02:58.868
Orkut went live to Brazil,
and shortly thereafter

00:02:58.868 --> 00:03:03.734
we saw pretty much an 8x
jump in installs overnight,

00:03:03.734 --> 00:03:06.634
which sort of blew us away
in terms of, you know,

00:03:06.634 --> 00:03:09.167
the--the expected growth
that we thought we would have.

00:03:09.167 --> 00:03:12.467
And that's all thanks to,
you know, App Engine's ability

00:03:12.467 --> 00:03:14.033
to scale.

00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:17.133
Um, so if you think back
to the demo,

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:19.868
we basically have--it's--
it's a very simple application.

00:03:19.868 --> 00:03:22.968
You can save an avatar,
you can poke a friend,

00:03:22.968 --> 00:03:24.567
and you can change
your mood.

00:03:24.567 --> 00:03:27.767
Um, each one of those
is a-a call to App Engine.

00:03:27.767 --> 00:03:33.067
And that stores, um, a db_model
into the datastore.

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:37.601
Um, and we actually store
just Jason, um, chunks

00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:39.234
as db_text.

00:03:39.234 --> 00:03:44.133
Um, when we first went live
with this on App Engine,

00:03:44.133 --> 00:03:48.868
uh, we sort of
didn't fully understand, um,

00:03:48.868 --> 00:03:52.000
the architecture
of, uh, BigTable

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.367
and how--
how Google App Engine scales.

00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:57.434
Um, I went to Google I/O,

00:03:57.434 --> 00:04:00.033
and I went to Brad
and Ryan's talks,

00:04:00.033 --> 00:04:02.367
and many others,
and basically learned

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:04.868
how App Engine
is architectured.

00:04:04.868 --> 00:04:08.701
And I highly recommend watching
the Google I/O, uh, videos

00:04:08.701 --> 00:04:10.367
that are available
on YouTube.

00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:13.601
Um, it--you know, I started off
doing things

00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:15.133
like db queries,

00:04:15.133 --> 00:04:18.067
which are a lot slower
than doing things like, uh,

00:04:18.067 --> 00:04:21.400
db_model, uh, get value
by key name.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.033
Um, and just doing things,
like, I was including dates

00:04:25.033 --> 00:04:28.067
in my database model when
I wasn't actually using them.

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:29.767
And it's, like, well,
if I'm not using them,

00:04:29.767 --> 00:04:31.567
why include them at all?

00:04:31.567 --> 00:04:34.634
Um, so there's a lot
of things that you can do

00:04:34.634 --> 00:04:37.767
to improve the performance
of your applications.

00:04:37.767 --> 00:04:39.868
And then obviously
you can let App Engine

00:04:39.868 --> 00:04:42.734
just take care of the rest
by doing the scaling.

00:04:42.734 --> 00:04:45.100
Um, another good thing
to know about

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.467
is doing things
like sharded counters.

00:04:47.467 --> 00:04:50.534
Um, I ran into this thing
where I was just use--

00:04:50.534 --> 00:04:54.234
using a counter to--
to count my installs.

00:04:54.234 --> 00:04:57.100
Um, and it's--you can see
in the graph, um,

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.534
obviously, when you get
so many installs,

00:04:59.534 --> 00:05:02.067
you--you have to start using
sharded counters

00:05:02.067 --> 00:05:06.267
to make sure you can handle,
um, the number of hits

00:05:06.267 --> 00:05:07.667
to your datastore.

00:05:07.667 --> 00:05:10.100
Otherwise you're gonna run
into concurrency problems.

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.367
So you've seen BuddyPoke!

00:05:11.367 --> 00:05:14.367
Um, I've showed you
how it--how it's scaled

00:05:14.367 --> 00:05:17.267
to approximately
13 million users.

00:05:17.267 --> 00:05:19.734
Uh, we're currently live
on four different sites.

00:05:19.734 --> 00:05:21.901
And hopefully soon
we'll be live

00:05:21.901 --> 00:05:23.801
on four or five
other different sites.

00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:27.367
And hopefully we'll be up to--
to 20 million users

00:05:27.367 --> 00:05:28.501
very soon.
